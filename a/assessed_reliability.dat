40|$|This article {{introduces}} {{the application of}} Generalizability Theory to <b>assessing</b> the <b>reliability</b> of measurements. Generalizability Theory {{can be used to}} <b>assess</b> <b>reliability</b> in the presence of multiple sources of error and also can be applied to <b>assess</b> <b>reliability</b> in the presence of different types of sources of error. In particular, the application of Generalizability Theory to measurements involving multiple raters is considered. An example illustrates its application to <b>assessing</b> <b>reliability</b> in the presence of inter-rater variability. When reporting results from a study, the need to <b>assess</b> <b>reliability</b> of measurements is generally recognized and measures of reliability are reported. For example, {{in a recent issue of}} the Journal of Agricultural Education, articles were consistent in reporting reliability coefficients where appropriate. None of these papers, however, used Generalizability Theory (GT) to obtain the coefficients, even when multiple sources of error existed; all used Classical Reliability coefficients. Under Classical Theory (CT), various reliability measures exist, but each can consider only a single source of error. Test-retest measures of reliability regard occasion as the source of error; parallel-forms measures of reliability regard the form as the source of error; and internal consistency reliability measures regard items as the source o...|$|R

An assessment of concurrent validity from 162 participants indicated that the ISS was significantly correlated with other related scales, including interaction attentiveness, impression rewarding, self-esteem, self-monitoring, and perspective taking. In addition, the predicted validity test from 174 participants showed that individuals with high ISS scores also scored high in intercultural effectiveness and intercultural communication attitude scales.

40|$|Abstract: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to develop a unified Portuguese-language version, for use in Brazil and Portugal, of the Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ) and to estimate its validity, reliability, and internal consistency in Brazilian and Portuguese female university students. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed using both original (34 -item) and shortened (8 -item) versions. The model's fit was assessed with &# 967;²/df, CFI, NFI, and RMSEA. Concurrent and convergent validity were <b>assessed.</b> <b>Reliability</b> was estimated through internal consistency and composite reliability (&# 945;). Transnational invariance of the BSQ was tested using multi-group analysis. The original 32 -item model was refined to present a better fit and adequate validity and reliability. The shortened model was stable in both independent samples and in transnational samples (Brazil and Portugal). The use of this unified version is recommended for the assessment of body shape concerns in both Brazilian and Portuguese college students...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{reliability}} problems of compound semiconductor transistors for microwave applications. These devices suffer from specific failure mechanisms, which {{are related to}} their limited maturity, {{with the exception of}} the GaAs MESFETs, which exhibit a stable technology and an <b>assessed</b> <b>reliability.</b> The metallizations employed in high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) already benefit from this assessment. However, HEMT are affected by concerns related to hot carriers and impact ionization. The trapping of carriers and the generation of defects in the different layers are responsible for the observed instabilities. The stability of the base dopant is the main reliability concern for heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs). Beryllium outdiffuses from the base into the emitter and causes device degradation. Carbon has a lower diffusivity, but is affected by the presence of hydrogen, which prompts gain variations. Finally the hot carriers reliability concern in SiGe HBTs is briefly reviewed.

40|$|With recent economic, political, {{and social}} events worldwide, {{reliability}} {{in the energy}} sector is growing more valuable, and the surrounding issues are gaining visibility. Increasingly, concerns about energy supply security (and climate change) have led to proposals to shift away from oil dependence to wide use of alternative transportation fuels, such as biofuels or hydrogen. Hydrogen {{is of particular interest}} because it offers multiple societal benefits. It is often asserted that hydrogen would enhance energy reliability because it can be made at diverse scales from many primary resources. But no studies have systematically <b>assessed</b> <b>reliability.</b> There are many questions surrounding energy system reliability – especially when considering a future fuel like hydrogen. How should reliability be defined and evaluated? And would a transition to hydrogen increase or decrease reliability? This paper presents a general method to assess reliability in energy supply systems. The technique uses qualitative ratings from an expert panel regarding a set of reliability metrics. We illustrate the method by evaluating two hydrogen pathways: 1) centralized steam reforming of imported liquefied natural gas and pipeline distribution of hydrogen, and 2) on-site electrolysis of water using electricity produce...|$|E
40|$|Protein {{interaction}} {{networks are}} widely used in computational biology as a graphical means of representing higher-level systemic functions in a computable form. Although, many algorithms exist that seamlessly collect and measure protein interaction information in network models, they often do not provide novel mechanistic insights using quantitative criteria. Measuring information content and knowledge representation in network models about disease mechanisms becomes crucial particularly when exploring new target candidates in a well-defined functional context of a potential disease mechanism. To this end, we have developed a knowledge-based scoring approach that uses literature-derived protein interaction features to quantify protein interaction confidence. Thereby, we introduce the novel concept of knowledge cliffs, regions of the interaction network where a significant gap between high scoring and low scoring interactions is observed, representing a divide between established and emerging knowledge on disease mechanism. To show the application of this approach, we constructed and <b>assessed</b> <b>reliability</b> of a protein-protein interaction model specific to Alzheimer's disease, which led to screening, and prioritization of four novel protein candidates. Evaluation of the identified candidates showed that {{two of them are}} already followed in clinical trials for testing potential AD drugs...|$|E

Data Extraction Measures with good psychometrics and 8 or higher (out of 10) clinical utility scores were recommended. Data Synthesis The searches identified 31 measures of the upper limb. However, only 2 measures fulfilled all of the psychometric and clinical utility criteria; the Box and Block Test and the Action Research Arm Test. Conclusions The Box and Block and the Action Research Arm Tests produce robust data and are feasible for use in clinical practice.

We wanted to study whether soy formula prolonged the physiologic estrogenization of newborns, but available quantitative descriptions of {{the natural history of}} breast and genital development are inadequate for study design. OBJECTIVE: We piloted techniques for assessing infants ’ responses to the withdrawal from maternal estrogen and gathered data on breast and genital development in infants at different ages. METHODS: We studied 37 boys and 35 girls, from term pregnancies with normal birth weights, who were < 48 hr to 6 months of age, and residents of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, during 2004 – 2005. One-third of the children of each sex and age interval were exclusively fed breast milk, soy formula, or cow-milk formula.
