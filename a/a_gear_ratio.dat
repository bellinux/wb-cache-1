25|$|A single-speed bicycle {{is a type}} of bicycle with {{a single}} gear ratio. These {{bicycles}} are without derailleur gears, hub gearing or other methods for varying the gear ratio of the bicycle. Adult single-speed bicycles typically have <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of between 55 and 75 gear inches, depending on the rider and the anticipated usage.|$|E
25|$|The base model's SOHC {{inline-four}} engine produced 95hp (71kW) {{and had a}} 9.1:1 compression ratio. The {{more powerful}} 1990–1991 GSi used a 1.6L DOHC engine that produced 130hp (97kW) and had a 9.8:1 compression ratio. The GSi package also included driving lights, a spoiler, a rear anti-sway bar, and a transmission with <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> that was slightly better for acceleration than the base model's manual transmission.|$|E
25|$|This {{multi-purpose}} locomotive {{received the}} working title E 46, but was then renamed to Class E 10, once the required maximum speed was increased from , which formally made this model an express train locomotive. The trial program, {{which consisted of}} 5 prototypes of class E 10.0, resulted in the realization that a single uniform type of electric locomotive was not sufficient to cover all needs. The modified program then included a local passenger train locomotive (class E 41); an express train locomotive (class E 10), which could be changed into a freight train locomotive (Class E 40) with <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> change, and a heavy six-axle freight train locomotive (class E 50). In addition plans for a high speed electric locomotive Class E 01 were made, but quickly cancelled, as, due to low maximum speeds on the main lines at that time, the class E 10 was seen as sufficient for express trains.|$|E
50|$|The Ravigneaux set has two sun <b>gears,</b> <b>a</b> large sun {{and a small}} sun, and {{a single}} planet carrier, holding two sets of {{planetary}} gears, inner planets and outer planets. The carrier is one sub-assembly but has two radii to couple with {{the inner and outer}} planets, respectively. The two sets of planet gears rotate independently of the carrier but co-rotate with <b>a</b> fixed <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> with respect to each other. The inner planets couple with the small sun gear and co-rotate at <b>a</b> fixed <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> with respect to it. The outer planets couple with the large sun gear and co-rotates with <b>a</b> fixed <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> with respect to it. Finally, the ring gear also couples and co-rotates with the outer planets in <b>a</b> fixed <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> with respect to them.|$|R

500|$|The SDP40F was a full-width cowl unit. Visually it {{resembled the}} EMD FP45 {{passenger}} locomotive; internally {{it was based}} on the ubiquitous EMD SD40-2 freight locomotive.

500|$|The {{design of}} the F40PH {{was based on the}} EMD GP40-2 freight {{locomotive}} and shared that locomotive's turbocharged EMD 645E3 V16 cylinder, two-stroke, water-cooled diesel engine (prime mover). The prime mover developed [...] at 893 RPM. The main (traction) generator converts mechanical energy from the prime mover into electricity distributed through a high voltage cabinet to the traction motors. Each of the four traction motors is geared to a pair of driving wheels; the gear ratio determines the maximum speed of the locomotive. A standard F40PH has <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of 57:20, permitting a maximum speed of [...] Some Amtrak F40PHs were delivered with a 56:21 gearing for [...] The first thirty locomotives were built with a [...] fuel tank; all subsequent units were built with a [...] tank.

5000|$|A {{company is}} said to be thinly capitalised when the level of its debt is much greater than its equity capital, i.e. its gearing, or leverage, is very high. An entity's debt-to-equity funding is {{sometimes}} expressed as a <b>ratio.</b> For example, <b>a</b> <b>gearing</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1.5:1 means that for every $2 of equity the entity has $3 of debt.|$|R

50|$|Track {{bicycles}} {{have only}} one drive sprocket (or cog) and one chainring, so the size ratio is relevant. <b>A</b> lower <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> allows quicker acceleration or 'jump' but can limit top speed. <b>A</b> larger <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> makes sustained speed easier, important in pursuit racing, time trial and bunched races such as points or scratch events.Without a good jump, the rider risks opponents accelerating away; without good sustained speed, the rider {{will be unable to}} keep up with a fast race. Track cyclists practice fast pedalling (cadence) as a compromise.|$|R
50|$|Crawl {{ratio is}} a term used in the {{automotive}} world to describe the highest <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> that <b>a</b> vehicle is capable of. Note that <b>gear</b> <b>ratio,</b> also known as speed <b>ratio,</b> of <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> train {{is defined as the}} ratio of the angular velocity of the input gear to the angular velocity of the output <b>gear,</b> and thus <b>a</b> higher <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> implies <b>a</b> larger speed reduction, i.e. the input speed is reduced more at the output. The highest <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> is obtained at either first gear or reverse gear, but only first gear is typically taken into consideration while talking about crawl ratio. A potentially confusing terminology is that although a better crawl ratio is achieved by <b>a</b> higher <b>gear</b> <b>ratio,</b> it is common to refer to a better crawl ratio as “lower crawl ratio” rather than “higher crawl ratio” as it is obtained by lowering the engine speed more.|$|R
50|$|Active Steering System realizes {{handling}} {{with more}} linear response by adaptively controlling front wheel turn angle according to steering input and vehicle speed. At slower vehicle speeds the system improves response by shifting to <b>a</b> quicker steering <b>gear</b> <b>ratio,</b> while at higher speeds it substantially improves stability by moving to <b>a</b> slower <b>gear</b> <b>ratio.</b> For rapid steering inputs, S-AWC momentarily increases front wheel turn angle and Super AYC control to realize sharper response. In countersteer situations, S-AWC increases responsiveness further {{to assist the}} driver with steering precision.|$|R

50|$|The most {{fundamental}} meaning {{is that of}} <b>an</b> overall <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> between engine and wheels, such that the car is over-geared, and cannot reach its potential top speed, i.e. the car could travel faster if it were in <b>a</b> lower <b>gear,</b> with the engine turning at higher RPM.|$|R
