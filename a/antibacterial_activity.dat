5|$|Zinc oxide {{nanoparticles}} {{can enhance}} the <b>antibacterial</b> <b>activity</b> of ciprofloxacin. It {{has been shown that}} nano ZnO which has the average size between 20nm and 45nm {{can enhance the}} <b>antibacterial</b> <b>activity</b> of ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in vitro. The enhancing effect of this nanomaterial is concentration dependent against all test strains. This effect may be due to two reasons. First, zinc oxide nanoparticles can interfere with NorA protein, which is developed for conferring resistance in bacteria and has pumping activity that mediate the effluxing of hydrophilic fluoroquinolones from a cell. Second, zinc oxide nanoparticles can interfere with Omf protein, which is responsible for the permeation of quinolone antibiotics into the cell.|$|E

5|$|Lactarius repraesentaneus was {{reported}} to have antibiotic activity against Staphylococcus aureus in 1947. The substance responsible for the <b>antibacterial</b> <b>activity,</b> determined to be heat-sensitive, was not identified. A number of chemicals have been isolated and identified from L.repraesentaneus that can regulate the growth of plants. The chemicals, in a class called sesquiterpenoids are named repraesentin A, and two related sesquiterpenes, namely repraesentins B and C. These compounds were shown to promote the radicle elongation of lettuce seedlings by 136%, 118% and 184% at 67 ppm, respectively. Other compounds reported in 2006 are repraesentins D, E, and F.

40|$|The {{physical}} and chemical properties of silver nanoparticles that are responsible for their antimicrobial activities have been studied with spherical silver nanoparticles (average diameter approximately 9 nm) synthesized by the borohydride reduction of Ag + ions, in relation to their sensitivity to oxidation, activities towards silver-resistant bacteria, size-dependent activities, and dispersal in electrolytic solutions. Partially (surface) oxidized silver nanoparticles have <b>antibacterial</b> <b>activities,</b> but zero-valent nanoparticles do not. The levels of chemisorbed Ag + that form on the particle's surface, as revealed by changes in the surface plasmon resonance absorption during oxidation and reduction, correlate well with the observed <b>antibacterial</b> <b>activities.</b> Silver nanoparticles, like Ag + in the form of AgNO 3 solution, are tolerated by the bacteria strains resistant to Ag +. The <b>antibacterial</b> <b>activities</b> of silver nanoparticles are related to their size, with the smaller particles having higher activities on the basis of equivalent silver mass content. The silver nanoparticles aggregate in media with a high electrolyte content, resulting in a loss of <b>antibacterial</b> <b>activities.</b> However, complexation with albumin can stabilize the silver nanoparticles against aggregation, leading to a retention of the <b>antibacterial</b> <b>activities.</b> Taken together, the results show that the <b>antibacterial</b> <b>activities</b> of silver nanoparticles are dependent on chemisorbed Ag +, which is readily formed owing to extreme sensitivity to oxygen. The <b>antibacterial</b> <b>activities</b> of silver nanoparticles are dependent on optimally displayed oxidized surfaces, which are present in well-dispersed suspensions. © 2007 SBIC. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|Pharmacia & Upjohn (now part of Pfizer) {{started its}} own oxazolidinone {{research}} {{program in the}} 1990s. Studies of the compounds' structure–activity relationships {{led to the development}} of several subclasses of oxazolidinone derivatives, with varying safety profiles and antimicrobial activity. Two compounds were considered drug candidates: eperezolid (codenamed PNU-100592) and linezolid (PNU-100766). In the preclinical stages of development, they were similar in safety and <b>antibacterial</b> <b>activity,</b> so they were taken to Phase I clinical trials to identify any difference in pharmacokinetics. Linezolid was found to have a pharmacokinetic advantage—requiring only twice-daily dosage, while eperezolid needed to be given three times a day to achieve similar exposure—and therefore proceeded to further trials. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved linezolid on April 18, 2000. Approval followed in Brazil (June 2000), the United Kingdom (January 2001), Japan and Canada (April 2001), Europe (throughout 2001), and other countries in Latin America and Asia.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{diversity}} of symbiotic fungi {{associated with the}} gorgonian coral Echinogorgia rebekka from the Weizhou coral reef in the South China Sea was investigated. Combined with morphologic traits, ITS-rDNA sequences revealed 18 fungal strains from this gorgonian. All of the 18 fungi belonged to the phylum Ascomycota and were distributed among seven genera in five orders: Eurotiales (Aspergillus and Penicillium), Pleosporales (Alternaria), Capnodiales (Cladosporium), Trichosphaeriales (Nigrospora) and Hypocreales (Hypocrea and Nectria). <b>Antibacterial</b> <b>activities</b> of these fungal strains were investigated with five pathogenic bacteria. All of the 18 fungal strains displayed different levels of <b>antibacterial</b> <b>activities,</b> most of which exhibited moderate to high <b>antibacterial</b> <b>activities</b> to the Gram-positive pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus tetragenus, and showed relatively low bioactivities to other three pathogenic bacteria.

5|$|Using a {{standard}} laboratory method to determine antimicrobial susceptibility, methanol-based extracts of Strobilurus tenacellus fruit bodies were {{shown in a}} 2000 study to have low <b>antibacterial</b> <b>activity</b> against the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, and low to moderate activity against the fungi Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus. The fungus produces the natural antibiotic strobilurinA, which was reported as a novel compound from this species in 1977; other strobilurins have since been found in other basidiomycete wood-rotting fungi, like Porcelain Mushroom for example. StrobilurinA {{is thought to be}} derived biosynthetically from the amino acid L-phenylalanine. In nature, the fungus secretes the chemical to prevent invasion by other fungi that challenge its nutrient source. It works by blocking electron transfer in the mitochondria, stopping respiration by binding to the ubihydroquinone oxidation center of the bc1 complex. This prevents the competing fungus from creating its own energy and inhibiting its growth at the earliest stages of the life cycle, the spore germination stage. The fungus is resistant to its own chemical because its ubihydroquinone has three amino acid residues that prevent the strobilurins from binding. Because of their sensitivity to light, and high vapor pressures that causes them to rapidly disappear when applied to the surface of a leaf, chemically unmodified strobilurins are not generally useful as fungicides for agricultural use. The strobilurin-derived compound azoxystrobin, ﬁrst made commercially available in 1996, was designed to overcome these limitations. It is the world's biggest-selling fungicide. Other commercial fungicides developed from the strobilurins include Allegro, and Brio (kresoxim-methyl) Amistar.|$|E
