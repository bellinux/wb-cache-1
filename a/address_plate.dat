The assignments evolved, {{over a period of}} 10 years, from papers handed in to the instructor, to online peer reviewed assignments using the calibrated peer review methodology. The assignments require students to acquire and plot data and use these data plots to create scientific arguments in support of a theory. The topics <b>address</b> <b>plate</b> tectonics, the Indian monsoon, the Earth's climate, and the world fisheries. The course activities are managed by the "EarthEd " software package, which supports course management functions such as online writing and peer review, image storage and upload, auto-graded homework problems, and course grade computation. Access to earth data is integrated within the EarthEd software through the "Our Dynamic Planet " CDROM, Global Ocean Data Viewer, and links to other data browsers available on the web. Data representations are captured as images, uploaded to the student's image library (in EarthEd) and then can be edited and linked to the writing assignment text.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Five U. S. high {{performance}} research reactors (HPRRs) are currently {{part of an}} international nonproliferation program {{with the objective of}} ultimately converting their highly enriched uranium (HEU) fuel to a new high density, low enriched uranium (LEU) fuel while still maintaining their reactor kinetic and thermal hydraulic performance. A uranium-molybdenum (U-Mo) alloy is under development as the proposed LEU fuel. This prototypic fuel must be qualified through the relevant regulator (either the Department of Energy (DoE) or Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)) prior to its implementation in the HPRRs. One particular aspect of this qualification being investigated is the hydro-mechanical integrity of the fuel elements during typical operation conditions; with emphasis on coolant-clad reactions. Due to the highly turbulent flow conditions which produce extreme viscous forces over the plate type fuel elements found in the HPRRs, interfacial reactions regarding the prototypic fuel are of concern for the fuel's qualification. One issue associated with coolant-clad interactions is the onset mechanical fuel plate instability induced by the flow field. This phenomenon has the potential to induce sufficient plate membrane stresses to challenge the hydro- and thermo-mechanical integrity of the elements. In this study, a flow induced vibration model is developed to characterize elastic plate motion of a single HPRR fuel plate in an attempt to <b>address</b> <b>plate</b> instability concerns associated with HPRR elements...|$|E

40|$|Many plate {{boundaries}} {{appear to}} be broad deformation zones, composed of several smaller microplates (e. g. California, Alaska, Mediterranean sea). To accurately <b>address</b> <b>plate</b> boundary deformation, as needed for seismic hazard assessment, {{it is important to}} study the motion of these microplates. Furthermore the dynamics of microplates, such as their driving forces and the implication of their motion on the surrounding plate boundary region are not well understood. Following suggestions from previous studies that Baja California is a microplate located within the North America – Pacific plate boundary region, a kinematic study using horizontal velocity data from Global Positioning System was performed. Building on the kinematic results and using numerical modelling techniques, a 2 D mechanical model that simulates the transport of the Baja California microplate by lithospheric coupling with the Pacific plate was created. This model addresses the transport forces, and necessary preconditions in the North America – Pacific plate boundary region for rigid microplate transport. In addition, this model provides insights on the deformational response of western North America to Baja California motion, in particular the kinematic response of neighbouring microplates and the activation of passive fault systems. This latter was examined in more detail by separating the contribution of deformation from Baja California microplate motion and Sierra Nevada microplate motion to the formation of the Eastern California Shear Zone. Overall, it was found, that microplates play an important role for plate boundary kinematics and that their motion strongly influences the dynamics and fault evolution in plate boundary regions...|$|E

40|$|Future {{challenges}} to the global food supply chain are complex. In order to embrace sustainability, companies should change their management practices towards more efficient resource use. Food waste being a misuse of resources, we identify its causes and possible ways of minimising it. To achieve this goal, we conducted explorative research with qualitative and quantitative data through in-depth semi-structured interviews and an open questionnaire with top Spanish food service companies. Results show that most businesses mainly tend to minimise food waste according to economic criteria, without {{taking into account the}} social, ethical or environmental factors. As a consequence, just “visible” food waste that has an economic impact on the results is minimised. Nevertheless, visibility of real waste is often low. At the same time, awareness of (and therefore initiatives to reduce) food waste that does not directly affect a firm’s profit can be increased through multi-stakeholder collaboration. Opportunities for reducing food waste therefore arise from increasing the visibility of food that is discarded as well as <b>addressing</b> <b>plate</b> waste.

40|$|An {{overview}} {{of different types}} of composite material system architectures and a brief review of progressive failure material modeling methods used for structural analysis including failure initiation and material degradation are presented. Different failure initiation criteria and material degradation models are described that define progressive failure formulations.

The failure initiation criteria include the maximum stress criteria, maximum strain criteria, the Tsai-Wu failure polynomial, and the Hashin criteria. The material degradation model is based on the ply-discounting approach where the local material constitutive coefficients are degraded. Applications and extensions of the progressive failure analysis material model <b>address</b> two-dimensional <b>plate</b> and shell finite elements and three-dimensional solid finite elements.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} the {{evaluation}} of response variability of composite plates due to randomness in the Poisson’s ratio in particular for the out-of-plane behavior. To this end, we adopt the weighted integral stochastic finite element (SFE) scheme and derive a SFE formulation employing Taylor’s expansion on the random Poisson’s ratio and displacement vector as well. In case of composite plates, the stiffness of the structure {{is affected by the}} stacking scheme of individual layers. This means that even the plates subjected only to in-plane loading can show out-of-plane behavior. In order to investigate this phenomenon, we chose two example plates with symmetric and asymmetric stacking scheme.

40|$|The Amerasian Basin of the Arctic Ocean conceals {{one of the}} few {{unresolved}} plate tectonic puzzles on Earth, {{with important}} implications for the geologic history of the vast adjoining shelfal regions. Until we are able to scientifically drill the most controversial parts of the Amerasian Basin seafloor, many questions about its age and origin will remain unanswered. To <b>address</b> the <b>plate</b> tectonic origin of the Amerasian Basin, we dredged steep escarpments along the Alpha Ridge, a bathymetric ridge that extends across the Amerasian Basin. The Alpha Ridge is dissected by structures that have been characterized by seismic reflection and which appear to be normal fault-bound linear ridges and basins. The Alpha Ridge {{has been described as a}} hot spot track, an oceanic plateau, and a possible spreading center. Dredged samples taken in 1985 from the central Alpha Ridge were determined to be highly altered fragmental basalt and yielded a Late Cretaceous 40 Ar/ 39 Ar whole rock age which agreed with the conventional models for a purely volcanic/oceanic origin of the Alpha Ridge (Forsythe and others, 1986; Lawver et al., 2002). Dredged rock samples were taken by the icebreaker USCGC Healy (HLY 0805, Mayer and Armstrong, 2008) and included samples from a steep slope of a subsidiary ridge in the south central Alpha/Mendeleev Ridge complex. The fresh broken surfaces of large blocks of rock and the lithologic similarity of the rocks recovered suggest an outcrop was sampled. The recovered rocks included interbedded red sandstones and ochre mudstones with well-defined bedding and sedimentary structures. Preliminary shipboard analysis suggests they may be tuffaceous and/or derived from volcanic sources, and may possibly be continental in origin. Further analysis and descriptions will be carried out in the coming months to determine their age and depositional environment. The results of this analysis and their possible implications for the origin of the Alpha Ridge and tectonic history of the Amerasian Basin will be presented...|$|R
40|$|We use 1 -D {{thermal history}} models and 3 -D {{numerical}} experiments {{to study the}} impact of dynamic thermal disequilibrium and large temporal variations of normal and shear stresses on the initiation of plate tectonics. Previous models that explored plate tectonics initiation from a steady state, single plate mode of convection concluded that normal stresses govern the initiation of plate tectonics, which based on our 1 -D model leads to plate yielding being more likely with increasing interior heat and planet mass for a depth-dependent Byerlee yield stress. Using 3 -D spherical shell mantle convection models in an episodic regime allows us to explore larger temporal stress variations than can be <b>addressed</b> by considering <b>plate</b> failure from a steady state stagnant lid configuration. The episodic models show that an increase in convective mantle shear stress at the lithospheric base initiates plate failure, which leads with our 1 -D model to plate yielding being less likely with increasing interior heat and planet mass. In this out-of-equilibrium and strongly time-dependent stress scenario, the onset of lithospheric overturn events cannot be explained by boundary layer thickening and normal stresses alone.

40|$|The {{increase}} in geodetic control points positioning by Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements in Indonesia, {{since the first}} campaign measurements in 1989 {{has led to a}} revolution in the precision, spatial coverage, spatial and temporal resolution of deformation measurements. To observe a trend towards the need for an accurate, seamless statewide control network for all spatial referencing activities are demanding. In response to these increasing spatial referencing needs, a systematic geodetic network maintenance procedure that minimizes the unique challenges within Indonesia to maintain control values up to date is a key issue. Maintenance procedure includes in monitoring temporal changes in geodetic coordinates due to Earth surface deformation, seismic activity, volcanic deformation, and land subsidence.

40|$|Reported {{evidence}} suggests that failure of gusset plates initiated {{the collapse of the}} I- 35 W Bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The particular gusset plates were at a panel point designated as U 10. Therefore, a computational study was conducted on the condition of the U 10 gusset plates at the time of bridge collapse. The primary objectives of this study were: (1) to evaluate previous research and existing design methods for gusset plate connections; (2) to examine the mechanical condition of the U 10 gusset plates {{at the time of the}} collapse; (3) to examine possible scenarios that led to the collapse of the entire bridge; and (4) to identify research needs to improve the design methods for gusset plate connections. The forces delivered to panel point U 10 were reproduced using available information of the bridge. The truss forces were introduced to detailed nonlinear, three-dimensional finite element models to calculate stress and strain states of the gusset plates. The results indicate that substantial portions of the U 10 gusset plates were yielded at the time of collapse, confirming earlier findings from federal and state investigations. Insufficient strength of the gusset plate, along with weight increase due to past deck reconstruction and construction material and equipment staged on the day of collapse, were identified as the main contributing factors to the substantial yielding. It is important to note that, even with the weight increase, the gusset plates would not have yielded substantially if the gusset plates had adequate thickness. The results also suggest that the interaction of compression and shear played an important role in the gusset plate failure and should be <b>addressed</b> in gusset <b>plate</b> design.
