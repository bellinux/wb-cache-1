30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was {{investigate}} the influence of different surface treatments on the shear bond strength of two different type of <b>artificial</b> <b>resin</b> teeth repaired with composite resin. Fifteen (15) artificial teeth of each material (CR-composite resin and AR-acrylic resin) were divided into four parts and then embedded in acrylic resin. After, the teeth were separated into eight groups according to the surface treatments prior to the repair: control group (c), adhesive application (a), sandblasting (S) and sandblasting followed by adhesive application (Sa). Next, a composite resin cylinder (Ø[*]=[*] 0.95  mm e h[*]=[*] 2  mm) simulating a repair was built onto each surface. The specimens were submitted to a microshear bond test after 24  h, using a universal testing machine (1  mm/min, 50 kgf) until fracture. The data was subjected to two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey test, with a significance level of 5 %. ANOVA showed statistical difference for the interaction artificial teeth material* surface treatment (p[*]=[*] 0.001). CR teeth (29.79 [*]±[*] 11.54  MPa) showed higher bond strength mean values than AR (18.48 [*]±[*] 9.73  MPa). Regardless the artificial teeth material, Sa (36.92 [*]±[*] 6.16  MPa) treatment showed the higher bond strength values. The highest bond strength value was found in CRSa (45.93 [*]±[*] 7.13  MPa) and the lowest was found in ARc (5.38 [*]±[*] 0.90  MPa). Based on the results, tooth material should be taken in account in order to choose the best surface treatment and achieve suitable bond strength values when a repair is necessary. For artificial teeth in acrylic resin, applying an adhesive system is the best procedure, with or without sandblasting the alumina particles. However, for artificial teeth in composite resin, an association of sandblasting followed by applying an adhesive system showed more promising bond strength values.|$|E

At present formaldehyde based adhesive such as urea formaldehyde(UF) and phenol formaldehyde(PF) is used as the binder. The main problem with these adhesives is continuous emission of formaldehyde vapors that are carcinogenic in nature. A number of developed countries have put ban on the import of these boards.

This modified lignin based adhesive is expected to replace the use of <b>artificial</b> <b>resins</b> like UF and PF and because of commonly available soy flour it will be economical and eco friendly. The fiberboards were prepared from three different adhesives, which are urea formaldehyde (UF) resins, natural adhesive (lignin) and protein-lignin based adhesives. Hot pressing at constant temperature 180 ºC and pressure 2 MPa within 4 minutes pressing was done to form the boards. For each board were tested for mechanical properties including modulus of rupture (MOR),thickness swelling (TS) and internal bond strength (IB). Results showed that SF,lignin,acetic acid (CH 3 COOH) and sodium hydroxide were all essential components for the adhesive and the SF: lignin:CH 3 COOH weight ratio of 3 : 75 : 10 with pH 11 resulted in the highest value of MOR, IB strength and water resistance.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an automatic device for in situ and continuous {{monitoring of the}} ageing process occurring in natural and synthetic resins widely used in art and in the conservation and restoration of cultural artefacts. The results of tests carried out under accelerated ageing conditions are also presented. This easy-to-assemble palm-top device, essentially consists of oscillators based on quartz crystal resonators coated with films of the organic materials whose response to environmental stress is to be addressed. The device contains a microcontroller which selects at pre-defined time intervals the oscillators and records and stores their oscillation frequency. The ageing of the coatings, caused by the environmental stress and resulting in {{a shift in the}} oscillation frequency of the modified crystals, can be straightforwardly monitored in this way. The kinetics of this process reflects the level of risk damage associated with a specific microenvironment. In this case, natural and <b>artificial</b> <b>resins,</b> broadly employed in art and restoration of artistic and archaeological artefacts (dammar and Paraloid B 72), were applied onto the crystals. The environmental stress was represented by visible and UV radiation, since the chosen materials are known to be photochemically active, to different extents. In the case of dammar, the results obtained are consistent with previous data obtained using a bench-top equipment by impedance analysis through discrete measurements and confirm that the ageing of this material is reflected in the gravimetric response of the modified quartz crystals. As for Paraloid B 72, the outcome of the assays indicates that the resin is resistant to visible light, but is very sensitive to UV irradiation. The use of a continuous monitoring system, apart from being obviously more practical, is essential to identify short-term (i. e. reversible) events, like water vapour adsorption/desorption processes, and to highlight ageing trends or sudden changes of such trends.

Mascara aims to temporarily darken, lengthen, and thicken eyelashes using a combination of waxes, pigments, and <b>resins.</b> <b>Artificial</b> eyelashes can be adhered either to the dermal margin or to individual eyelashes. Individuals may even use eyelash transplantations to improve the appearance of their eyelashes. The unique properties of eyelashes (e. g., relatively long telogen and short anagen phases compared with scalp hairs, slow rate of growth, and a lack of influence by androgens) may allow for specific aesthetic interventions to improve the appearance of natural eyelashes. Some over-the-counter (OTC) products may contain prostaglandin analogs that can affect eyelash growth, but neither the safety nor efficacy of these OTC cosmetics has been fully studied. Originally indicated for the reduction of intraocular pressure, the synthetic prostaglandin analog bimatoprost was recently approved for the treatment of hypotrichosis of the eyelashes. In a double-blinded, randomized, vehicle-controlled trial, bimatoprost safely and effectively grew natural eyelashes, making them longer, thicker, and darker. Bimatoprost was generally safe and well tolerated and appears to provide an additional option for individuals looking to improve the appearance of their eyelashes...|$|R
40|$|DE 10060379 A UPAB: 20020823 NOVELTY - A process {{creates a}} {{thin-walled}} three-dimensional work piece using a layered combination of endless fibres and resin. The fibres and resin {{are placed in}} layers on a support base together with a fixing agent which is activated. The fibre layers or hanks are placed non-tensioned individually, in groups, regular patterns, in wave, loops or snake pattern in defined webs. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The fibre lay-ups are laid in regular cross lay-up web patterns on a previous fibre lay-up. The resulting panel is subsequently cut to required dimensions and shapes. The panel is then placed in a tool form and further shaped with additional <b>artificial</b> fibres and <b>resin.</b> The bottom layer (10) consists of fibres (101, 102) of limited strength resting between warp and weft (71, 72) fibre layers. Prior to the application of resin, the fibre positions are fixed by {{the application of a}} spray whose characteristics accord with those of the final material. The smallest average fibre radius is between 10 and 90 mm, and the fibre length is between 80 and 200 mm. The fibres are textured to the appropriate wave or snake profile prior to lay-up. USE - Process to manufacture relatively large flat panels incorporating only a limited structure and few curves. ADVANTAGE - The lay-up process is faster and cheaper than prior art...|$|R
40|$|Background: Detachment of denture acrylic <b>resin</b> <b>artificial</b> teeth from {{denture base}} resin {{is one of}} the most common {{problems}} presented by denture wearers. Purpose: This study investigated the shear bond strength (SBS) and fracture type of bonding interface of two commercial acrylic teeth (Vipi Dent Plus e Biolux) to two denture base resins (Vipi Cril e Lucitone 550) after immersion in potentially chromogenic beverages (coffee, cola soft drink, and red wine) or control solution (distilled water). Materials and Methods: Maxillary central incisor acrylic teeth were placed at 45 ° to denture base resin and submitted to short polymerization cycle according to manufacturers. Specimens were divided according to the combination tooth/resin/solution (n = 8) and submitted to bond strength tests in a universal testing machine MTS- 810 (0. 5 mm/min). Subsequently, fracture area was analyzed by stereomicroscope at a magnification of × 10 and categorized into adhesive, cohesive, or mixed failure. Results: The bond strength of teeth/denture base resins interface was not significantly affected by tested solutions (P > 0. 087), except for Biolux teeth immersed in coffee (P < 0. 01). In all conditions, the Vipi Dent Plus teeth showed higher bond strength to Lucitone and Vipi Cril resins when compared to Biolux teeth (P < 0. 003). All specimens' failure modes were cohesive. Conclusions: The SBS of acrylic teeth to denture base resins was not generally influenced by immersion in the tested staining beverages...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study aims to {{evaluate}} the degree of conversion (DC) and hydrolytic degradation through the Vickers hardness test (HV) of a nanofilled (Filtek™ Z- 250, 3 M) and a microhybrid (Filtek™Supreme-XT, 3 M) composite resin. Materials and methods: Eight disk-shaped specimens (4 mm diameter × 2 mm thick, ISO 4049) of each material were prepared for each test. Composites were inserted into single increment in a metallic matrix and light-cured for 40 seconds. VH readings were performed for each specimen at predetermined intervals: immediately after polymerization (control), 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 30 and 180 days. After curing, initial hardness measurements were performed and the specimens were immersed in artificial saliva at 37 °C. For DC (%), specimens were ground, pressed with KBr and analyzed by FT-IR spectrophotometer. Results: Student t-test showed {{that there was no}} difference between the resins for DC (p = 0. 252). ANOVA analysis revealed that Z- 250 VH means were all greater than S-XT, for both top and bottom surfaces, whatever the storage-period in artificial saliva (p < 0. 001). After 180 days of storage, the hardness obtained for S-XT was similar with that at the baseline, for both top and bottom surfaces. While for Z- 250 hardness was not significantly different from baseline only for top surface, but there was a significant decrease observed in hardness for bottom surface. Conclusion: The materials tested showed no evidence of hydrolytic degradation in a significant way, in a 6 -month storagetime in <b>artificial</b> saliva. Nanofilled <b>resin</b> presents a monomer conversion comparable to the conventional microhybrid...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Bonding {{orthodontic}} {{attachments to}} large amalgam restorations of posterior teeth is a challenge. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate and compare the shear bond strength (SBS) of orthodontic attachments bonded to amalgam with different chemical surface preparations. Materials and methods: In this in vitro study 105 convex amalgam surface samples were subjected to aluminium oxide sandblasting. The amalgam sampless were randomly divided into three equal groups. In each group buccal tubes were bonded with Transbond Plus using Reliance Metal Primer (RMP), All Bond II (AB 2), and Alloy Primer (AP). Thirty-five human teeth served as the controls to test buccal tube bonding to acid-etched enamel with Transbond Plus and Transbond XT. All the samples were stored in artificial saliva; after thermocycling for 1000 times, all the sampels were tested for SBS. Data were analysed with Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. Results: There were statistically significant differences in SBS values between all the groups (p value < 0. 001). AB 2 created the strongest bond to amalgam (6. 75 MPa). However, there were no significant differences between SBS values achieved with AB 2 and those in the control group (p value = 0. 455). No Significant differences were observed between AP and RMP (p value = 0. 051) but both had significant differences with the control group (p value < 0. 001). Conclusion: The results of the present study revealed that AB 2 intermediate resin is useful for strong bonding of metal orthodontic attachments to dental amalgam.
