50|$|For Class I, the {{proposed}} mechanism is that chromatid breakage occurs during mitosis, {{resulting in a}} chromosome fragment. That <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragment</b> may segregate with the intact chromatid and result in partial tetrasomy; or, it may segregate with the complementary broken chromatid and result in partial trisomy because the broken chromatid may be saved by telomere restitution. In both cases, the inverted duplicated marker forms only after cell division and replication by rejoining the broken, replicated ends of the fragment. It is also suggested that U-type exchange during meiosis I may lead to partial tetrasomy.|$|E
40|$|Genotoxic {{events have}} been known as crucial step in the {{initiation}} of cancer. To assess the risk of cancer, genotoxicity assays, including comet, micronucleus (MN), chromosomal aberration, bacterial reverse, and sister chromatid exchange assay, can be performed. Compared with in vitro genotoxicity assay, in vivo genotoxicity assay {{has been used to}} verify in vitro assay result and definitely provide biological significance for certain organs or cell types. The comet assay can detect DNA strand breaks as markers of genotoxicity. Methods of the in vivo comet assay have been established by Japanese Center for the Validation of Alternative Methods (JaCVAM) validation studies depending on tissue and sample types. The MN can be initiated by segregation error and lagging <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragment.</b> Methods of the in vivo MN assay have been established by Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) test guidelines and many studies. Combining the in vivo comet and MN assay has been regarded as useful methodology for evaluating genetic damage, and it has been used in the assessment of potential carcinogenicity by complementarily presenting two distinct endpoints of the in vivo genotoxicity individual test. Few studies have investigated the quantitative relation between in vivo genotoxicity results and carcinogenicity. Extensive studies emphasizes that positive correlation is detectable. This review summarizes the results of the in vivo comet and MN assays that have investigated the genotoxicity of carcinogens as classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) carcinogenicity database. As a result, these genotoxicity data may provide meaningful information for the assessment of potential carcinogenicity and fo...|$|E
40|$|Micronuclei (MN) {{are formed}} during mitosis {{and do not}} {{integrate}} in the main nucleus. They may arise from a whole lagging chromosome or an <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragment.</b> An increase of MN frequency indicates genomic instability. The MN test is commonly {{used to determine the}} genotoxic effects of chemical and physical agents on somatic cells. It is applied to all types of cells reproducing by mitosis in vitro and in vivo, and it is easier and faster to perform than the chromosome aberration assay. With the development of the in vitro cytochalasin-B block method for detecting MN frequency in binuclear cells, its reliability and validity has been increased. At the same time, the test enables an estimation of cytotoxicity using the frequency of nuclear division index in in vitro studies, and the ratio between polychromatic erythrocytes and normochromatic erythrocytes in in vivo studies. Human beings and other species are exposed to a large number of chemical and physical factors in their environment. Therefore, the genotoxic studies about the adverse effects and potential risks of those factors gain importance exponentially. The MN test is a practical bio-monitoring test that provides an investigation tool on genotoxic and carcinogenic potentials and reliability of physical agents, drugs and all types of other chemical such as pollutants, food additives to which people are exposed daily, and it helps to predict and monitor the cancer risk. The MN technique, which has been used for many years due to its advantages such as simplicity, reliability, validity and applicability to different types of cells, will also carry on {{an important role in the}} future in the evaluation and prevention of mutagenicity. The aim of this review is to give information about the MN technique, which is considered to be an indirect indication for genetic damage in cells...|$|E
50|$|<b>Acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments</b> {{may arise}} {{in a variety}} of ways. One way is that {{disrepair}} of DNA double-strand breaks can lead to symmetrical or asymmetrical chromatid and chromosome exchanges as well as chromatid and <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments.</b> If DNA damage exceeds the repair capacity of the cell, unrepaired double-stranded DNA breaks may also result in <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments.</b> Another way eccentric <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments</b> may arise is when defects in genes related to homologous recombinational repair (ex: ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51) result in a dysfunctional error-free homologous recombinational DNA repair pathway and causes the cell to resort to the error-prone non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair pathway, increasing the likelihood of incorrect repair of DNA breaks, formation of dicentric <b>chromosomes,</b> and <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments.</b> If enzymes in the NHEJ repair pathway are defective as well, DNA breaks may not be repaired at all. Additionally, simultaneous excision repair of damaged or inappropriate bases incorporated in DNA that are in proximity and on opposite complementary DNA strands may lead to DNA double-stranded breaks and micronucleus formation, especially if the gap-filling step of the repair pathway is not completed.|$|R
50|$|Micronuclei {{primarily}} {{result from}} <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments</b> or lagging whole chromosomes {{that are not}} included in the daughter nuclei produced by mitosis because they fail to correctly attach to the spindle during the segregation of chromosomes in anaphase.

50|$|Micronuclei {{formation}} {{may also}} result from chromosome malsegregation during anaphase. Hypomethylation of cytosine in centromeric and pericentromeric areas and higher-order repeats of satellite DNA in centromeric DNA {{can result in}} such chromosomal loss events. Classical satellite DNA is normally heavily methylated at cytosine residues but may become almost fully unmethylated due to ICF syndrome (Immunodeficiency, centromere instability, and facial anomalies syndrome) or after treatment by DNA methyl transferase inhibitors. Since assembly of kinetochore proteins at centromeres {{is affected by the}} methylation of cytosine and histone proteins, a reduction in heterochromatin integrity as a result of hypomethylation can interfere with microtubule attachment to chromosomes and with the sensing of tension from correct microtubule-kinetochore connections. Other possible causes of chromosome loss that could lead to micronuclei formation are defects in kinetochore and microtubule interactions, defects in mitotic spindle assembly, mitosis check point defects, abnormal centrosome amplification, and telomeric end fusions that result in dicentric chromosomes that detach from the spindle during anaphase. Micronuclei originating from chromosome loss events and <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments</b> can be distinguished using pancentromeric DNA probes.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe cytokinesis-blocked {{micronucleus}} (CBMN) assay, {{in combination}} with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) of human pan-centromeric DNA probes, or with CREST antibodies that specifically stain kinetochore proteins, is widely used on several cell types. It distinguishes micronuclei containing one or several whole chromosomes, which are positively labeled (centromere positive micronucleus, C+MN, due to aneugenic effect), or <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments,</b> which are unlabeled due {{to the absence of}} centromere (centromere negative micronucleus. C-MN, due to clastogenic effect). However, the very slight level of the centromeric signals obtained with the FISH technique on primary human fibroblasts, a cell type commonly used in environmental genetic toxicology, leads to great difficulties in distinguishing C+MN and C-MN. Furthermore, the CREST technique may lead to inappropriate results particularly with regards to variations in antibody composition between patient sera. Our results show that the in vitro CBMN, {{in combination with}} immunofluorescence staining of CENP-A (centromere protein A), efficiently screens genotoxicants for their ability to induce clastogenic and/or aneugenic effects. We propose the in vitro CBMN assay in combination with immunofluorescence staining of CENP-A as a suitable tool in environmental genotoxicity testing of primary human fibroblasts.

40|$|SummaryChromosomal {{instability}} (CIN) is {{a common}} feature of most human neoplasms and was defined, in a seminal study by Vogelstein and colleagues [1], as persistently elevated rates of whole chromosome mis-segregation. Since then, it was shown that certain errors in mitosis, including defects in the spindle assembly checkpoint [2], sister chromatid cohesion [3], kinetochore-microtubule (kMT) attachments [4, 5], and centrosome number [6] can cause chromosome mis-segregation {{in the form of}} merotelically attached anaphase lagging chromosomes — chromosomes that lag behind at the spindle equator while all the other chromosomes move toward the spindle poles [7] (Figure 1 A). A recent study has suggested that pre-mitotic replication stress generates partially replicated chromosomes during mitosis, and that this results in both numerical and structural chromosome abnormalities through the formation of <b>chromosome</b> bridges and <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments</b> during anaphase [8]. To determine whether whole chromosome instability in cancer cells is caused by defects originating in mitosis (lagging chromosomes) or from ones originating pre-mitotically (chromatin bridges and acentric fragments), we compared a variety of CIN+ to CIN- cells to determine the types of segregation defects that phenotypically distinguish CIN+ from CIN- cells and whose abrogation can rescue whole chromosomal instability...|$|R

This poleward transport of <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments</b> ceased near the onset of anaphase and was replaced. near midanaphase, by another force that now transported the fragments to the spindle equator at 1. 5 - 2. 0 microm/min. These fragments then remained near the spindle midzone until phragmoplast development, at which time they were again transported randomly poleward but now at approximately 3 microm/min. This behavior of <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments</b> on anastral plant spindles differs from that reported for the astral spindles of vertebrate cells, and demonstrates that in forming plant spindles, a force for poleward chromosome motion is generated independent of the kinetochore. The data further suggest that the three stages of non- kinetochore chromosome transport we observed are all mediated by the spindle microtubules. Finally, our findings reveal that there are fundamental differences between the transport properties of forming mitotic spindles in plants and vertebrates...|$|R

Blood samples from 102 prostate cancer patients were obtained before radiotherapy to investigate the excess <b>acentric</b> <b>fragments</b> and dicentric <b>chromosomes.</b> In addition, in a subgroup of ten patients, simple exchanges in chromosomes 2 and 4 were evaluated by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), before the onset of therapy, in the middle and at the end of therapy, and 1  year later. Data were compared to blood samples from ten age-matched healthy donors. We found that spontaneous yields of <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments</b> and simple exchanges were significantly increased in lymphocytes of patients before onset of therapy, indicating chromosomal instability in these patients. Ex vivo radiation-induced aberrations were not significantly increased, indicating proficient repair of radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks in lymphocytes of these patients. As expected, the yields of dicentric and <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> and the partial yields of simple exchanges, were increased after the onset of therapy. Surprisingly, yields after 1  year were comparable to those directly after radiotherapy, indicating persistence of chromosomal instability over this time.

40|$|To whom {{correspondence}} {{should be}} addressed Using human lymphocytes and the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay we have recently shown that excision-repairable DNA lesions induced by methylnhrosourea (MNU) and ultraviolet (UV) light (254 nm) {{can be converted to}} micronuclei (MNi) within one cell cycle if cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C) is added during the G, phase of the cell cycle after mitogen stimulation. We have proposed that this conversion resulted from the inhibition by ARA-C of the gap-filling step during excision repair which results in the formation of single-stranded breaks at repair sites; these breaks are then converted to chromatid or chromosome breaks and subsequently to MNi on completion of nuclear division. To confirm this hypothesis we have examined the origin of MNi induced by ARA-C by using anti-kinetochore antibodies and found that between 77 and 86 % of these MNi are kinetochore-negative which supports the idea that they originate mainly from <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments.</b> We have also demonstrated that combining ARA-C treatment with hydroxyurea (HU) during G! provides a synergistic improvement in the conversion of spontaneous (4 -fold increment) or MNU-induced (2 -fold increment) excision-repairable DNA lesions to MNi when compared to the effects with ARA-C alone.

We {{have used this}} methodology in several human cell strains to reduce expression of the Prkdc (DNA-PKcs) gene coding for the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) that {{is involved in the}} nonhomologous end joining of DNA double-strand breaks.

40|$|The {{effects of}} DNA {{substitution}} by the thymidine analogue 5 -bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) on cell cycle progression and mkronucleus induction were studied in different mammalian cell cultures. Simultaneous flow cytometric measurements of DNA content and side scatter of nuclei in Chinese hamster embryo (CHE) cells revealed a concentration-dependent temporary {{block in the}} G 2 /M phase of the first cell cycle. NTH 3 T 3 cells and human amniotic fluid fibroblast-like cells, on the contrary, did not show any cell cycle disturbances {{in the presence of}} BrdU. Micronucleus frequency increased as soon as CHE cells started to divide and reached a plateau when all cells have divided. The height of this plateau was almost equal for 60 and 100 /tM BrdU. This saturation of micronucleus induction was due to a saturation of BrdU incorporation into DNA already at a dosis of 60 /tM as shown by the BrdU/Hoechst quenching technique. Indirect immuno-fluorescent staining of kinetochores with CREST antibodies revealed that nearly all BrdU-induced micronuclei were kinetochore-negative suggesting the presence of <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments</b> in these micronuclei.

40|$|The {{frequencies}} of micronuclei (MNi) in the gill {{cells of the}} mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis were determined {{over a long period}} (up to 28 days) following a 48 -h treatment with colchicine. The frequency of MNi at the end of treatment was significantly higher than in controls and 24 h later it had increased even more. After this period, the frequency of MNi rapidly declined until a plateau level was reached on day 2 - 3, which was significantly higher than the control baseline level, and persisted {{until the end of the}} experiment (28 th day). In the same cell system we previously reported a persistence of an increased frequency of MNi after treatment with mitomycin C (MMC) (Majone et al., 1987). In order to establish the origin of MNi, the difference between their size distribution in MMC- and colchicine-treated animals was determined at the end of treatment as well as during the plateau phase. The difference was statistically significant (P less than 0. 001) at the end of treatment, the MNi induced by MMC being smaller than those induced by colchicine. However, the difference during the plateau phase was not statistically significant. Human CREST antikinetochore fluorescent antibodies reacted with chromosome centromeres of Mytilus and were applied to gill cells at the end of a 48 -h treatment with MMC or colchicine. About 60 % of the MNi induced by colchicine but only 30 % of those produced by MMC reacted positively with the fluorescent antibodies. This result indicates that the majority of MNi observed at the end of a 48 -h treatment with MMC or colchicine originate, respectively, from <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments</b> and from whole lagging chromosomes...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review is to {{summarise}} current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms by which in vivo exposure to exogenous chemical genotoxins in humans induces micronuclei (MNi) and other nuclear anomalies in lymphocytes in vivo and ex vivo after nuclear division in vitro. MNi originate from <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments</b> and/or whole <b>chromosomes</b> that are unable to engage with the mitotic spindle and/or fail to segregate properly to the daughter nuclei during anaphase. The lagging <b>fragments</b> or whole <b>chromosomes</b> are surrounded by membrane and become MNi. Acentric fragments are caused by failure of repair or mis-repair of DNA strand breaks which may be induced by chemicals that (i) damage the phosphodiester backbone of DNA, and/or (ii) inhibit the DNA damage response mechanisms or repair of DNA strand breaks and/or (iii) cause DNA replication stress due to DNA adduct or cross-link formation. MNi originating from lagging whole chromosomes may be induced by chemicals that cause defects in centromeres or the mitotic machinery. Mis-repair of chemically-induced DNA breaks may also cause formation of dicentric chromosomes and nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs) between daughter nuclei in mitosis. NPBs may break and initiate recurring breakage-fusion-bridge cycles and chromosomal instability. The review also explores knowledge on (i) the routes by which lymphocytes {{in the human body}} may be exposed to genotoxic chemicals, (ii) kinetics of MNi expression in lymphocytes in vivo and ex vivo in the lymphocyte cytokinesis-block micronucleus (L-CBMN) assay and (iii) current evidence on the efficiency of the L-CBMN assay in detecting in vivo exposure to chemical genotoxins and its concordance with MNi expression in epithelial tissues.

40|$|Abstract: A "micronucleus " {{is a small}} nucleus. The nucleus is the {{organelle}} in {{the cell}} that contains the genetic material (DNA) that directs normal cellular function and cellular reproduction. In cells of eukaryotic organisms, the nucleus contains DNA packaged into chromosomes. In vivo mutagencity and carcinogenicity studies are posing a high demand for test related resources. The in vitro micronucleus assay is a mutagenic test system {{for the detection of}} chemicals which induce the formation of small membrane bound DNA fragments i. e. micronuclei in the cytoplasm of interphase cells. These micronuclei may originate from <b>acentric</b> <b>fragments</b> (<b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments</b> lacking a centromere) or whole chromosomes which are unable to migrate {{with the rest of the}} chromosomes during the anaphase of cell division. The micronucleus assay is an important component of genetic toxicology screening programs. There is substantial evidence that chromosome mutations and related events in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes of somatic cells are involved in induction and/or progression of some cancers in humans and experimental animals. The study of DNA damage at the chromosome level is an essential part of genetic toxicology because chromosomal mutation is an important event in carcinogenesis. The micronucleus assays have emerged as one of the preferred methods for assessing chromosome damage because they enable both chromosome loss and chromosome breakage to be measured reliably...|$|R

40|$|Although it is {{well known}} that {{micronuclei}} may arise from either DNA breakage leading to <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments</b> or from chromosome/chromatid lagging in anaphase, the ratio between the amount of DNA breakage induced and the frequency of micronuclei expressed in the following interphase is unclear. With the development of the alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis assay, which measures single strand and/or double strand breaks in a cell by cell approach, it is now possible to address this question at the cellular level, We therefore compared the genotoxic potential of pure cobalt powder (Go) and a cobalt-containing alloy, cobalt-tungsten carbide (WC-Go), involved in specific lung disorders, in parallel with the alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay (comet assay) and the cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus (MN) test, both carried out in vitro on isolated human leukocytes. The comet assay indicated that the WC-Co mixture produced a higher level of DNA damage than Co alone; WC alone was not able to induce a dose-dependent DNA breakage effect as was seen for Co and WC-Co. Results from the MN test confirmed these observations, It was clear that the clastogenic property of Go-containing dust is significantly enhanced when the Co metal is mixed with WC and suggested that their physicochemical characteristics may act as one of the important parameters responsible for the increased incidence of lung cancers observed in the population of hard metal workers. In agreement with data obtained in the same laboratory on liposoluble chemicals (PCBs and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons) and from the literature, the results indicate that both the comet assay and the micronucleus test were able to detect differences in the genotoxic potential of the compounds studied. Although the micronucleus test seemed to be less sensitive to assess a synergistic DNA damaging potential of the mixture involved, it detects chromosomal aberrations (chromosome/genome mutations) and not just repairable DNA breakage or alkali-labile sites, Combination of the comet assay and the in vitro MN test might therefore be recommended for genotoxins to understand the mechanisms underlying mutagenicity and to assess the lowest efficient dose...|$|R
50|$|Micronucleus is {{the name}} given to the small nucleus that forms {{whenever}} a <b>chromosome</b> or a <b>fragment</b> of a <b>chromosome</b> is not incorporated {{into one of the}} daughter nuclei during cell division.

40|$|Unrepaired {{double strand}} DNA breaks can have {{deleterious}} consequences at mitosis {{due to the}} generation of <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments</b> that lack centromeres. Although acentrics are common in cancer cells, surprisingly {{little is known about}} the mechanisms regulating kinetochore-independent <b>chromosome</b> segregation. <b>Acentrics</b> are efficiently induced in Drosophila neuroblasts by expressing an endonuclease called I-CreI. Previous reports in Drosophila have found that while acentrics lack a kinetochore, they still move to the metaphase plate and segregate to daughter cells. The delayed but ultimately successful segregation of acentrics requires a chromatin tether that connects the acentrics to the main chromosome mass. The tethers are decorated with BubR 1, Aurora B and Polo kinases. Disruptions in BubR 1 and Polo functions led to defects in acentric segregation and a decreased rate of survival from larvae into adulthood (synthetic lethality). This led to the conclusion that the tether provides the driving force for acentric segregation. Here, I demonstrate that acentrics are preferentially bundled with microtubules during anaphase suggesting that microtubules and motor proteins exert the force for driving acentric segregation. Interestingly, the orientation of acentrics during anaphase is random with half the acentrics segregating telomere first (telomere facing pole), while the other half segregates telomere last (telomere facing metaphase plate). This is in accord with a model in which acentrics behave as cargo capable of associating in any orientation with microtubules. By conducting a synthetic lethality screen, I found that I-CreI expressing larvae with disruptions in Klp 3 a, which encodes for a chromosome and microtubule-associated motor protein (chromokinesin) led to an increased rate of synthetic lethality. Through live imaging, I found defects in acentric segregation in neuroblast depleted of Klp 3 a. Taken together, these results suggest that the cell maintains a microtubule and Kp 3 a dependent mechanism to drive acentric segregation. 	Delayed acentric segregation during anaphase raises the question of how acentrics affect nuclear envelope reformation (NER). Here I demonstrate that acentrics enter daughter nuclei by inducing a local delay in NER, which leads to the formation of a channel in the nuclear envelope. The formation of the nuclear envelope channels is dependent on Aurora B kinase...|$|R
40|$|Checkpoint {{mechanisms}} that respond to DNA {{damage in the}} mitotic cell cycle are necessary to maintain the fidelity of chromosome transmission. These mechanisms {{must be able to}} distinguish the normal telomeres of linear chromosomes from double-strand break damage. However, on several occasions, Drosophila chromosomes that lack their normal telomeric DNA have been recovered, raising the issue of whether Drosophila is able to distinguish telomeric termini from nontelomeric breaks. We used site-specific recombination on a dispensable chromosome to induce the formation of a dicentric <b>chromosome</b> and an <b>acentric,</b> telomere-bearing, <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragment</b> in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster. The acentric fragment is lost when cells divide and the dicentric breaks, transmitting a chromosome that has lost a telomere to each daughter cell. In the eye imaginal disc, cells with a newly broken chromosome initially experience mitotic arrest and then undergo apoptosis when cells are induced to divide as the eye differentiates. Therefore, Drosophila cells can detect and respond to a single broken chromosome. It follows that transmissible chromosomes lacking normal telomeric DNA nonetheless must possess functional telomeres. We conclude that Drosophila telomeres can be established and maintained by a mechanism that does not rely on the terminal DNA sequence...|$|R

Reduced BubR 1 or Polo function results in abnormal segregation of acentric chromatids, a decrease in <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> tethering, and a great reduction in adult survival.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Unrepaired DNA {{double-stranded}} breaks (DSBs) {{can result}} in the whole or partial loss of chromosomes. Previously, we showed that the ends of broken chromosomes remain associated. Here, we have examined the machinery that holds broken chromosome ends together, and we have explored the behavior of broken chromosomes as they pass through mitosis. Results: Using GFP-localized arrays flanking an HO endonuclease site, we examined the association of broken chromosome ends in yeast cells that are checkpoint-arrested in metaphase. This association is partially dependent upon Rad 50 and Rad 52. After 6 – 8 hr, cells adapted to the checkpoint and resumed mitosis, segregating the broken chromosome. When this occurred, {{we found that the}} acentric fragments cosegregated into either the mother or daughter cell 95 % of the time. Similarly, pedigree analysis showed that postmitotic repair of a broken chromosome (rejoining the centric and acentric fragments) occurred in either the mother or daughter cell, but rarely both, consistent with a model in which both acentric sister chromatid fragments are passaged into the same nucleus. Conclusions: These data suggest two related phenomena: an intrachromosomal association that holds the halves of a single broken sister chromatid together in metaphase and an interchromosomal force that tethers broken sister chromatids to each other and promotes their missegregation. Strikingly, the interchromosomal association of DNA breaks also promotes the missegregation of centromeric chromosomal fragments, albeit to a lesser extent than acentric fragments. The DNA break-induced missegregation of <b>acentric</b> and centric <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments</b> provides a novel mechanism for the loss of heterozygosity that precedes tumorigenesis in mammalian cells...|$|R

Recombination in inverted regions leads to dicentric or <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosomes</b> (chromosomes with two centromeres or no centromere). Progeny carrying chromosomes that are {{the products of}} recombination between balancer and normal chromosomes are not viable (they die).|$|R
40|$|Because of {{multiple}} abnormalities in her children, {{a young mother}} was investigated and shown to have a 47,XXX chromosome constitution. Additional C group chromosomes without visible centromeric constrictions were found {{in a number of}} cells from the peripheral blood, and using C and Q banding techniques these chromosomes were identified as X chromosomes. Analysis of the banding karyotypes of 300 cells revealed that the <b>acentric</b> X <b>chromosomes</b> had the ability to replicate and that this replication was associated with non-disjunction leading to aneuploid cells. Even though cultured skin cells did not have <b>acentric</b> or extra <b>chromosomes</b> in addition to the triple-X, examination of buccal mucosa cells for the presence of X-bodies suggested that the phenomenon of non-disjunction was present in the epithelial cells of the patient. In addition to the X without a visible centromeric constriction, either acentric D or E chromosomes were found. The data suggest that a functional defect in the cells per se is responsible for the appearance of the <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosomes...</b>|$|R
40|$|A stable, {{persistent}} {{infection of}} A 172 human glioblastoma cells with simian virus 40 (SV 40) was readily established after infection at an input of 450 PFU per cell. Only 11 % {{of the cells}} were initially susceptible to SV 40, as shown by indirect immunofluorescent staining for the SV 40 T antigen at 48 h. However, all cells produced T antigen by week 11. In contrast, viral capsid proteins were made in only about 1 % of the cells in the established carrier system. Weekly viral yields ranged between 10 (4) and 10 (6) PFU/ml. Most of the capsid protein-producing cells contained enormous aberrant (lobulated or multiple) nuclei. Persistent viral DNA appeared in an episomal or "free" state exclusively in Southern blots and was indistinguishable from standard SV 40 DNA by restriction analysis. Viral autointerference activity was not detected, and yield reduction assays did not indicate defective interfering particle activity, further implying that variant viruses were not a factor in this carrier system. Interferon was also not {{a factor in the}} system, as shown by direct challenge with vesicular stomatitis virus. Persistent infection resulted in cellular growth changes (enhanced saturation density and plating efficiency) characteristic of SV 40 transformation. Persistent infection also led to an increased frequency of cytogenetic effects. These included sister chromatid exchanges, a variety of chromosomal abnormalities (ring <b>chromosomes,</b> <b>acentric</b> <b>fragments,</b> breaks, and gaps), and an increase in the chromosome number. Nevertheless, the persistently infected cells continued to display a bipolar glial cell-like morphology with extensive process extension and intercellular contacts...|$|R
40|$|An optical scalpel {{and optical}} tweezer have been {{combined}} to perform intracellular microsurgery and micromanipulation in vivo. When only laser microsurgery {{was performed on}} metaphase chromosomes, the dissected sister chromatid fragments drifted off to either {{the side of the}} spindle or completely off the spindle. At anaphase the fragments separated and the two arms generally moved to their respective daughter cells. When the chromosome arm was cut during anaphase A and B, the distal <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragment</b> separated {{from the rest of the}} chromosome and moved toward the pole, following the proximal <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragment.</b> Distal <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments</b> laser-dissected during metaphase were held together throughout anaphase using the optical trap. Optical trapping of dissected <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments</b> during anaphase A and B inhibited movement of the <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragment</b> to its pole. As a result, the trapped <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments</b> were (1) incorporated into the opposite daughter cell, (2) lost in the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis, or (3) eventually incorporated into the correct daughter cell. These results indicate that optical traps are effective in holding laser-dissected <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments</b> throughout mitosis. This new tool should be useful for studies on chromosome movement and cell genetics. © 1993 Academic Press, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Aberrant {{chromosome}} structures {{can promote}} tumors {{in the early}} stages of carcinogenesis and lead to tumor cells becoming resistant to chemotherapy, for example by changing in drug metabolism. Dicentric (containing two centromeres) and acentric (containing no centromeres) chromosomes are two abnormal chromosome structures that consider as precursors of a variety of gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs) generated by subsequent recombination events [1 - 7]. However, the mechanism of the dicentric and <b>acentric</b> palindromic <b>chromosome</b> formation and their subsequent metabolism is difficult to directly visualise. The previous results from our lab shows that replication forks stalled at a specific replication termination sequence (RTS 1) can result in the formation of the dicentric and <b>acentric</b> palindromic <b>chromosomes</b> in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe [48 - 52]. However, the formation of <b>acentric</b> and dicentric <b>chromosomes</b> results in a significant visability loss, due to instability and miss-segregation of the chromosomes in the yeast cells. Thus, their fate is difficult or impossible to follow. To resolve this problem, a non-essential mini-chromosome (Ch 16) was developed as a novel model system in this project. The behaviour of rearranged chromosome in vivo and their subsequent fate have been visualised by integrating the lac operator (lacO) and tetracycline operator (tetO) arrays with auxotropic makers, adjacent to the RTSI locus on Ch 16. The results reveal imbalanced segregation of a dicentric chromosome and subsequently undergoes a breakage event. An <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> appears to be decoupled or lost rapidly from the nucleus...|$|R
40|$|The 15 q 11 -q 13 {{region is}} {{characterized}} by high instability, caused {{by the presence of}} several paralogous segmental duplications. Although most mechanisms dealing with cryptic deletions and amplifications have been at least partly characterized, {{little is known about the}} rare translocations involving this region. We characterized at the molecular level five unbalanced translocations, including a jumping one, having most of 15 q transposed to the end of another chromosome, whereas the der(15) (pter-. q 11 -q 13) was missing. Imbalances were associated either with Prader-Willi or Angelman syndrome. Array-CGH demonstrated the absence of any copy number changes in the recipient chromosome in three cases, while one carried a cryptic terminal deletion and another a large terminal deletion, already diagnosed by classical cytogenetics. We cloned the breakpoint junctions in two cases, whereas cloning was impaired by complex regional genomic architecture and mosaicism in the others. Our results strongly indicate that some of our translocations originated through a prezygotic/postzygotic two-hit mechanism starting with the formation of an acentric 15 qter-. q 1 ::q 1 -. qter representing the reciprocal product of the inv dup(15) supernumerary marker chromosome. An embryo with such an <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> plus a normal chromosome 15 inherited from the other parent could survive only if partial trisomy 15 rescue would occur through elimination of part of the <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome,</b> stabilization of the remaining portion with telomere capture, and formation of a derivative chromosome. All these events likely do not happen concurrently in a single cell but are rather the result of successive stabilization attempts occurring in different cells of which only the fittest will finally survive. Accordingly, jumping translocations might represent successful rescue attempts in different cells rather than transfer of the same 15 q portion to different chromosomes. We also hypothesize that neocentromerization of the original <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> during early embryogenesis may be required to avoid its loss before cell survival is finally assured...|$|R

40|$|Chromosomal rearrangements {{occur in}} all organisms and are {{important}} {{both in the}} evolution of species and in pathology. In this dissertation I show that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or budding yeast, one type of chromosomal rearrangement occurs when inverted repeats fuse, likely during DNA replication by a novel mechanism termed "faulty template switching". This fusion can lead to the formation of either a dicentric or <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome,</b> depending on the direction of the replication fork. Dicentric chromosomes are inherently unstable due to their abnormal number of centromeres, and thus undergo additional chromosomal rearrangements and chromosome loss...|$|R

A clear modal chromosome number of 29 was obtained above 12, 500 erg/mm 2. The frequencies of <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments</b> decreased with increased UV dose.

40|$|Homologous {{chromosome}} synapsis (``homosynapsis'') {{and crossing}} over are well-conserved aspects of meiotic chromosome behavior. The long-standing assumption {{that these two}} processes are causally related has been challenged recently by observations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae of significant levels of crossing over (1) between small sequences at nonhomologous locations and (2) in mutants where synapsis is abnormal or absent. In order to avoid problems of local sequence effects and of mutation pleiotropy, we have perturbed synapsis by making a set of isogenic strains that are heterozygous and homozygous for a large chromosomal paracentric inversion covering a well marked genetic interval and then measured recombination. We find that reciprocal recombination in the marked interval in heterozygotes is reduced variably across the interval, on average to ~ 55 % {{of that in the}} homozygotes, and that positive interference still modulates crossing over. Cytologically, stable synapsis across the interval is apparently heterologous rather than homologous, consistent with the interpretation that stable homosynapsis is required to initiate or consummate a large fraction of the crossing over observed in wild-type strains. When crossing over does occur in heterozygotes, dicentric and <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosomes</b> are formed and can be visualized and quantitated on blots though not demonstrated in viable spores. We find that there is no loss of dicentric chromosomes during the two meiotic divisions and that the <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> is recovered at only 1 / 3 to 1 / 2 of the expected level...|$|R
40|$|PurposeTo combine {{telomere}} and centromere (TC) staining {{of premature}} chromosome condensation (PCC) fusions to identify dicentrics, centric rings, and <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> making possible {{the realization of}} a dose–response curve and automation of the process. Methods and MaterialsBlood samples from healthy donors were exposed to 60 Co irradiation at varying doses up to 8 Gy, followed by a repair period of 8 hours. Premature chromosome condensation fusions were carried out, and TC staining using peptide nucleic acid probes was performed. Chromosomal aberration (CA) scoring was carried out manually and automatically using PCC-TCScore software, developed in our laboratory. ResultsWe successfully optimized the hybridization conditions and image capture parameters, to increase the sensitivity and effectiveness of CA scoring. Dicentrics, centric rings, and <b>acentric</b> <b>chromosomes</b> were rapidly and accurately detected, leading to a linear-quadratic dose–response curve by manual scoring at up to 8 Gy. Using PCC-TCScore software for automatic scoring, {{we were able to}} detect 95 % of dicentrics and centric rings. ConclusionThe introduction of TC staining to the PCC fusion technique has made possible the rapid scoring of unstable CAs, including dicentrics, with a level of accuracy and ease not previously possible. This new approach can be used for biological dosimetry in radiation emergency medicine, where the rapid and accurate detection of dicentrics is a high priority using automated scoring. Because there is no culture time, this new approach can also be used for the follow-up of patients treated by genotoxic therapy, creating the possibility to perform the estimation of induced chromosomal aberrations immediately after the blood draw...|$|R
