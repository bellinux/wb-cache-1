5|$|Brentwood Academy {{sued the}} {{association}} over this action. Brentwood {{argued that the}} enforcement of the rule constituted state action which they claimed violated the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The school asserted that their due process rights had been violated because there were no evidentiary hearings to determine the validity of the claim that they inappropriately recruited football players. Further, they argued that the rule violated their freedom of speech because it restricted the ways the Academy could recruit. In July 1998, the District Court agreed with this <b>argument</b> <b>and</b> granted summary judgement to the Academy, while enjoining the association from enforcing the rule. A year later, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the lower court's decision, finding that the actions of the association did not constitute 'state action'. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari of the case to review this question.|$|E
5|$|Charles Cardell (1892–1977) was {{the founder}} of a Pagan Witchcraft {{tradition}} that rivalled that of Gerald Gardner's in southern England during the 1950s.

Having been involved with Spiritualism as well as Pagan Witchcraft, Cardell initially befriended Gardner, but in 1958 they had an <b>argument,</b> <b>and</b> in 1964 Cardell tried to discredit him by publishing much of the then-secret Gardnerian Book of Shadows.|$|E
