Coulter grew up mostly on her own because her mother worked two jobs to pay the bills. During primary school, Coulter participated in many sports, including swimming, touch football and netball, which she played for six years.

Ratliff continued, [...] "She eases up on songs with total-affirmation chants about being the captain of her ship ... The lyrics are half-terrible — almost too {{realistic}} as teenage thoughts — but {{the best of them}} transmit the desired message ... It’s a lackluster album, floated by two or three strong singles." [...] Josh Timmermann of PopMatters believed Breakout was [...] "a just-okay teenpop record with audible suggestions of said singer-songwriter aspirations. To be sure, it’s a stronger collection of songs than Moms <b>and</b> <b>Dads</b> with upturned noses ... would probably expect." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine rated the album two and half stars out of five, being disappointed and deeming the songs not to be a [...] "worthy follow-up" [...] to [...] "See You Again". Cinquemani finished, [...] "For teen-pop, your kid could do worse. You know, like Avril [...] ". Mordechai Shinefield of The Village Voice wrote, [...] "If her lyrical prowess hasn't caught up to her voice yet, that should only hold promise of things to come. She's a rare talent; now she only has to survive until adulthood." [...] Ash Dosanjh of Yahoo! Music gave Breakout seven stars out of ten and referred to Cyrus, in Breakout, as the ideal of the American Dream: [...] "a combination of hard work, good Christian living and un-smutty pop".|$|E
