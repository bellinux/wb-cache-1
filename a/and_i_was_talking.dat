60|$|The {{inhabitants}} of the farmhouse have one great and rare merit--they are people whom you can make friends with at once. Between not knowing them at all, and knowing them well enough to shake hands at first sight, there is no ceremonious interval or formal gradation whatever. They received us, on our arrival, exactly {{as if we were}} old friends returned from some long traveling expedition. Before we had been ten minutes in the hall, William had the easiest chair and the snuggest corner; the children were eating bread-and-jam on the window-seat; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> to the farmer's wife, with the cat on my lap, of the time when Emily had the measles.|$|E

I think nobody can justly accuse me of sparing myself upon any occasion, but really I cannot do {{everything}} at once. And as for Fanny's just stepping down to my house for me--it is not much above a quarter of a mile--I cannot think I was unreasonable to ask it.

6000|$|This morning, when Jone was out {{taking a}} walk <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> to Miss Pondar, and getting her to {{teach me how to}} make Devonshire clotted cream, which we have for every meal, putting it on {{everything}} it will go on, into everything it will go into, and eating it by itself when there is nothing it will go on or into; and trying to find out why it is that whitings are always brought on the table with their tails stuck through their throats, as if they had committed suicide by cutting their jugular veins in this fashion, I saw, coming along the road to our cottage, a pretty little dogcart with two ladies in it. The horse they drove was a pony, and the prettiest creature I ever saw, being formed like a full-sized horse, only very small, and with as much fire and spirit and gracefulness as could be got into an animal sixteen hands high. I heard afterward that he came from Exmoor, which is about twelve miles from here, and produces ponies and deers of similar size and swiftness. They stopped at the door, and one of them got out and came in. Miss Pondar told me she wished to see me, and that she was Mrs. Locky, of the [...] "Bordley Arms" [...] in the village.|$|E
60|$|My wife put {{her hand}} on my sleeve and frowned, and I had so far lost myself in my {{appreciation}} of the scene that I was going to ask her what the matter was, when a general sensation about me made me look at the track, where the horses for the first race had already appeared, with their jockeys in vivid silk jackets of various dyes. They began to form for the start with the usual tricks and feints, till I became very indignant with them, though I had no bets pending, and did not care in the least which horse won. What I wanted was to see the race, the flight, and all this miserable manoeuvring was retarding it. Now and then a jockey rode his horse far off on the track and came back between the false starts; now and then one kept stubbornly behind the rest and would not start with them. How their several schemes and ambitions were finally reconciled I never could tell, but at last the starter's flag swept down and they were really off. Everybody could have seen perfectly well as they sat, but everybody rose and watched the swift swoop of the horses, bunched together in the distance, and scarcely distinguishable by the colours of their riders. The supreme moment came for me when they were exactly opposite the grand stand, full half a mile away--the moment that I remembered from year to year as one of exquisite illusion--for then the horses seemed to lift from the earth as with wings, and to skim over the track like a covey of low-flying birds. The finish was tame to this. Mrs. March and I had our wonted difference of opinion as to which horse had won, and we were rather uncommonly controversial because we had both decided upon the same horse, as we found, only she was talking of the jockey's colours, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> of the horse's. We appealed to Kendricks, who said that another horse altogether had won the race, and this compromise pacified us.|$|E

5000|$|Contrary {{to popular}} legend that Drake dropped the album {{off in a}} plastic bag at Island Records' {{reception}} and then left without anyone realising, Drake delivered the master tapes of Pink Moon to Chris Blackwell at Island. In an interview for the Nick Drake fanzine Pynk Moon in 1996, Island's press officer David Sandison recalled that Drake's arrival at the record company had certainly not gone unnoticed, although there had been no indication that he was delivering them a new album: [...] "I saw him in reception after I came back from lunch <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> to somebody and I saw a figure in the corner on the bench, and I suddenly realized it was Nick. He had this big, 15 ips per second master tape box under his arm, and I said 'Have you had a cup of tea?' and he said 'Erm, yes', and I said 'Do you want to come upstairs?' and he said 'Yes, okay'. So we went upstairs into my office, which was on top of the landing, it was a landing that went into the big office with a huge round table where Chris and everybody else worked—very democratic—and there was a big Reevox (sic) and sound system there, and he just sat in my office area for about half an hour ... After about half an hour he said 'I'd better be going', and I said 'Okay, nice to see you', and he left. Now, he went down the stairs and he still had the tapes under his arm, and about an hour later the girl who worked behind the front desk called up and said 'Nick's left his tapes behind'. So I went down and it was the big sixteen-track master tape and it said NICK DRAKE PINK MOON, and I thought 'that's not an album I know'. The first thing to do was get it in the studio to make a seven and a half inch safety copy, because that was the master. So we ran off a safety copy to actually play, and I think twenty four hours later or so, it was put on the Reevox in the main room and we heard Pink Moon." ...|$|E

You’d better have, {{you must have been}} tired, I know I was. I’m going to hit the sack right after I mail this. I feel like the wreck of the Hesperus. Did you have any snow down thar in New York? We had our first snow squall today, and man, is it cold. I was flying the first period this morning, and I could see the storm coming in from the North West like a huge white curtain.

I’ve been looking over the financial situation, hon, and allowing for everything, a small amount of recreation included, I ought to have $ 4. 38 saved by March if I budget myself very carefully. Not bad for me, eh? But seriously, angel, it’s not as bad as all that. I’ve got some pretty good ideas as to how to raise some money, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> to a fellow here that just bought an engagement and a wedding ring, and they’re not too expensive, at least not $ 500. But as you said before, you don’t get married every day, so by God we’re going to have the best. But most of all, darling, I want you to be happy. If there is ever any doubt in your mind, just let me know. We’ve still got {{a lot of things to}} settle, hon. I want to have a long talk with you this weekend. Oh by the way, have you told your father yet? I wonder what he’ll have to say. Maybe I better send him another carton of cigarettes. Well hon, the sergeant just finished drawing my bath, I don’t want to keep him waiting. Give my best to your family. Your mother is really marvelous. I love you.
