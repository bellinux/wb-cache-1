5|$|Abbasid power dwindled {{during the}} 10th century, when the empire {{disintegrated}} and was divided {{among a number}} of vassals. Most of the new rulers acknowledged the caliph as their nominal sovereign, <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> which continued until the Mongol destruction of the Abbasid Caliphate in 1258.|$|E

From 840 until the rise of Aboji, the Khitans remained a tributary of the Tang dynasty.|$|E
25|$|Worldwide Press Freedom Index is {{published}} each year since 2002 (except that 2011 was combined with 2012) by France-based Reporters Without Borders.

50|$|The type of {{situation}} die being used depends on {{the difficulty of the}} action. Difficulty is scaled in die types of -d20, -d12, -d8, -d6, -d4, +d0, +d4, +d6, +d8, +d12, +d20, +2d20, +3d20. <b>A</b> character's base <b>situation</b> die is +d4 for broad skill or feat check, +d0 for specialty skill or action check. <b>A</b> minus <b>situation</b> bonus means player uses <b>a</b> larger negative <b>situation</b> die set, while <b>a</b> plus <b>situation</b> penalty means <b>a</b> player uses <b>a</b> larger positive <b>situation</b> die set.|$|R
5|$|In {{algebraic}} geometry and theoretical physics, mirror symmetry {{is a relationship}} between geometric objects called Calabi–Yau manifolds. The term refers to <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> where two Calabi–Yau manifolds look very different geometrically but are nevertheless equivalent when employed as extra dimensions of string theory.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{the show}} {{began to take}} on a more serious tone as a seriocomic (or dramedy) series, in which the focus was on the {{character}} rather than the character type, and moved away from its status as <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> comedy.|$|E
5|$|Pushing {{against an}} object that rests on a {{frictional}} surface can result in <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by static friction, generated between the object and the table surface. For <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> with no movement, the static friction force exactly balances the applied force resulting in no acceleration. The static friction increases or decreases {{in response to the}} applied force up to an upper limit determined by the characteristics of the contact between the surface and the object.|$|E
50|$|Situations, unlike worlds, are not {{complete}} {{in the sense}} that every proposition or its negation holds in a world. According to Situations and Attitudes, meaning is a relation between <b>a</b> discourse <b>situation,</b> <b>a</b> connective <b>situation</b> and <b>a</b> described <b>situation.</b> The original theory of Situations and Attitudes soon ran into foundational difficulties. A reformulation based on Peter Aczel's non-well-founded set theory was proposed by Barwise before this approach to the subject petered out in the early 1990s.|$|R
5000|$|A {{serious effort}} was made to prevent the {{relationship}} between Connolly and MacArthur becoming public and indeed it was claimed that this was homosexual, something that was later discounted. Connolly was promptly requested to return to Ireland where he then resigned on 16 August. Haughey attempted to distance himself from the fiasco and described the event as [...] "a bizarre happening, <b>an</b> unprecedented <b>situation,</b> <b>a</b> grotesque <b>situation,</b> <b>an</b> almost unbelievable mischance." ...|$|R
5000|$|It was {{a bizarre}} happening, <b>an</b> {{unprecedented}} <b>situation,</b> <b>a</b> grotesque <b>situation,</b> <b>an</b> almost unbelievable mischance. The corresponding acronym, GUBU, was coined by Conor Cruise O'Brien, and both {{it and the}} phrase are still occasionally used in Irish political discourse to describe notorious scandals. In January 2011 some ministerial resignations from the Government were described by its opponent Michael Noonan as [...] "...bizarre, grotesque {{and to some extent}} unbelievable." ...|$|R
5|$|The International Criminal Court's {{prosecutor}} may open {{a formal}} investigation {{in one of}} three circumstances: when <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> is referred by the government of a state which the investigation concerns, when the situation is referred by the UN Security Council or under his own volition with authorisation from a Pre-Trial Chamber.|$|E
5|$|The {{principle}} of the liberum veto preserved the feudal features of Poland's political system, weakened {{the role of the}} monarchy, led to anarchy in political life, and contributed to the economic and political decline of the Polish state. Such <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> made the country vulnerable to foreign invasions and ultimately led to its collapse.|$|E
5|$|A {{by-election}} {{need not}} be held to fill a vacancy in any GRC triggered by the death or resignation of an MP, {{even if there are}} no other minority candidates in that GRC, or any other reason. A by-election is required only if all the MPs in a GRC vacate their Parliamentary seats. Assuming that such <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> does arise, the Prime Minister would be obliged to call a by-election within a reasonable time, unless he intends to call a general election in the near future.|$|E

40|$|The Gettier Problem and Moore’s Paradox {{are related}} {{in a way}} that is unappreciated by philosophers. If one is in <b>a</b> Gettier <b>situation,</b> then one is also in <b>a</b> Moorean <b>situation.</b> The fact that S is in <b>a</b> Gettier <b>situation</b> (the fact that S is “Gettiered”), like the fact that S is in <b>a</b> Moorean <b>situation</b> (the fact that S is “Moored”), cannot (in the logical sense of “cannot”) be known by S while S is in that situation. The paper starts the job of mapping what can be said about this feature of Gettier situations. The goal is to stimulate further {{exploration}} into this yet uncharted territory...|$|R

5|$|A simple case {{of dynamic}} {{equilibrium}} occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction. In such <b>a</b> <b>situation,</b> a {{force is applied}} {{in the direction of}} motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force. This results in zero net force, but since the object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity. Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force. However, when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion.|$|E
5|$|A {{state of}} {{national}} emergency has an {{adverse effect on}} these rights. Under such a state, the rights conferred by Article 19 (freedoms of speech, assembly and movement, etc.) remain suspended. Hence, in such <b>a</b> <b>situation,</b> the legislature may make laws that go against the rights given in Article 19. Also, the President may by order suspend the right to move court for the enforcement of other rights as well.|$|E
5|$|ASL {{originated}} in the early 19th century in the American School for the Deaf (ASD) in Hartford, Connecticut, from <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> of language contact. Since then, ASL use has propagated widely via schools for the deaf and Deaf community organizations. Despite its wide use, no accurate count of ASL users has been taken, though reliable estimates for American ASL users range from 250,000 to 500,000 persons, including a number of children of deaf adults. ASL users face stigma due to beliefs in the superiority of oral language to sign language, {{compounded by the fact}} that ASL is often glossed in English due to the lack of a standard writing system.|$|E

5|$|Approach-avoidance {{conflict}} {{happens when}} <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> is presented that {{can either be}} rewarding or punishing, and the ensuing decision-making {{has been associated with}} anxiety. fMRI findings from studies in approach-avoidance decision-making found evidence for a functional role that is not explained by either long-term memory or spatial cognition. Overall findings showed that the anterior hippocampus is sensitive to conflict, and that it may be part of a larger cortical and subcortical network seen to be important in decision making in uncertain conditions.|$|E

5|$|Benefits Street is a British {{documentary}} series broadcast on Channel 4. It was first aired on 6 January 2014, {{and ran for}} five episodes. The show was filmed by documenting the lives of several residents of James Turner Street, Winson Green, Birmingham, England, United Kingdom, where newspapers including the Daily Mail and The Guardian reported that 90% of the residents claim benefits. It shows benefits claimants committing crimes, including a demonstration of how to shoplift, and portrays <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> {{in which people are}} dependent on welfare payments and lack the motivation to seek employment.|$|E
5|$|By 1980, Gulf {{exhibited}} many of {{the characteristics}} of a giant corporation that had lost its way.
