"For, observe, {{the lines}} which cause these far-away effects of shadow, are not, as often in less noble rocks, caused by real cracks {{through the body}} of the mountain; for, were this so, it would follow, from what has just been stated, that these aiguilles were cracked through and through in every direction, and {{therefore}} actually weaker, instead of stronger, than other rocks. But the <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>fracture</b> is entirely external, and the sympathy or parallelism of the lines indicates, not an actual splitting through the rock, but a mere disposition in the rock to split harmoniously when it is compelled to do so. Thus, in the shell-like fractures on the flank of the Aiguille Blaitière, the rock is not actually divided, as it appears to be, into successive hollow plates. Go up close to the inner angle between one bed of rock and the next, and the whole mass will be found as firmly united as a piece of glass. There is absolutely no crack between the beds,--no, not so much as would allow the blade of a penknife to enter for a quarter of an inch;[124] but such a subtle disposition to symmetry of fracture {{in the heart of the}} solid rock, that the next thunderbolt which strikes on that edge of it will rend away a shell-shaped fragment or series of fragments; and will either break it so as to continue the line of one of the existing sides, or in some other line parallel to that. And yet this resolvedness to break into shell-shaped fragments running north and south is only characteristic of the rock at this spot, and at certain other spots where similar circumstances have brought out this peculiar humor. Forty yards farther on it will be equally determined to break in another direction, and nothing will persuade it to the contrary. Forty yards farther it will change its mind again, and face its beds round to another quarter of the compass; and yet all these alternating caprices are each parts of one mighty continuous caprice, which is only masked for a time, as threads of one color are in a patterned stuff by threads of another; and thus from a distance, precisely the same cleavage is seen repeated again and again in different places, forming a systematic structure; while other groups of cleavages will become visible in their turn, either as we change our place of observation, or as the sunlight changes the direction of its fall." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{systematic}} analysis of the mechanical properties of nanocolumnar TiO 2 thin films prepared by evaporation at a glancing geometry. A systematic study of the mechanical properties is carried out by comparing the hardness and the Young's modulus determined by nanoindentation for thin films prepared at different deposition angles and characterized by a tilted nanocolumnar structure and others where the nanocolumns are perpendicular to the substrate or are arranged as zig-zag stacked layers. A correlation between mechanical properties and glazing angle geometry is proposed. Differences in the results are discussed {{in view of the}} cross section images obtained by focused ion beam and of the deformed areas.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to review the different phenomena responsible for crack growth in the IN 718 nickel-base superalloy under the combination of fatigue, creep and oxidation. We review the descriptions of the micro-mechanisms found in the literature, with a special emphasis on the time-dependent effects. The changes in the microscopic <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>fracture</b> surfaces due to the variations in the temperature, frequency, dwell time, microstructure and partial pressure of oxygen are considered. Elucidation of these microscopic aspects of crack growth requires establishing a connection with macroscopic conditions and parameters of crack growth, and these topics are touched upon in the present review insofar as it is necessary. The review allows the identification of important parameters that control component durability, and need to be included in fatigue crack growth modelling for the development of better predictive lifing assessments.

40|$|Abstract. Aluminium-silicon alloys having {{different}} silicon contents (13, 20 and 27 percent) {{were used}} in the present study. The molten alloys were poured in to a mild steel die to cast tensile test bars. Then tensile and hardness tests were performed in order to analyze the properties and fracture surfaces of the cast specimens. Results show that as silicon content increases, the alloy becomes harder and less ductile. At the same time, the presence of alloying and impurity elements in the alloys forms complex compounds and intermetallic phases. They present deleterious effects on the strength of the alloys, causing a lowering of the energy required to fracture the test specimens with little permanent extension. However, heat treatment operations altered the structures and properties of the aluminium-silicon alloys. Heating to higher temperature, then quenching, ageing and tempering make the alloys stronger up to 13 % silicon and beyond that limit the alloys become weaker, fracturing at lower load. The <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>fracture</b> surfaces after tensile testing showed these differences. This investigation also suggests that for the aluminium-silicon alloys containing 20 % and 27 % silicon do not require any expensive and time consuming thermal treatment operations, since properties do not improve with such treatments...|$|E

All 11 infants underwent skeletal surveys; five infants also underwent nuclear bone scanning. Postmortem radiographs of the specimen and histopathologic data were available in two infants. RESULTS: A total <b>of</b> 22 <b>fractures</b> were noted. Six infants had <b>fractures</b> <b>of</b> the hands: six metacarpal and nine proximal phalangeal fractures. Five infants had <b>fractures</b> <b>of</b> the feet: six metatarsal fractures and one proximal phalangeal fracture.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Little {{is known}} about the {{mechanisms}} involved when triggering avalanches artificially by ex-plosions. Here we test the hypothesis that weak layer failure is mainly initiated by wave induced stresses exceeding the strength of the specific layer. We therefore performed experiments with explosives on a flat study site in winter 2013 - 2014 in wet and dry snowpacks. At three different distances from the point of explosion we measured surface air pressure and accelerations within the snowpack at various depths. We evaluated snow density and dielectric properties with conventional methods in snow profiles and used this information together with empirical relationships to build a Biot-type porous model of the snowpack. Acoustic wave propagation was simulated by solving Biot’s equations numerically with a pseudo-spectral approach. Failure in the snowpack was modelled if compressional and shear stresses exceeded the strength limits for the corresponding snow density. Modelled failure locations were compared to the actual <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>fractures</b> in the field measurements. The results are a promising step towards models in-cluding more complex geometries which will help to improve planning of fixed avalanche control installa-tions...|$|R

Myofibrils for SDS-PAGE and Western blots and intact muscle samples for transmission electron microscopy were prepared at 0, 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days postmortem (PM). In SDS-PAGE, ES slightly accelerated the degradation of intact titin (T 1 band), nebulin, desmin and troponin-T in AxJ samples. In Western blots of AxJ samples, ES enhanced T 1 degradation, the <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> a 38 kDa desmin degradation product and the accumulation of the 30 kDa polypeptide but had no detectable affect on nebulin degradation. Both SDS-PAGE and Western blots of BxS samples showed that ES {{had no effect on}} degradation of T 1, nebulin, desmin and troponin-T but slightly enhanced the accumulation of the 30 kDa polypeptide.

Methodics: Empirical part of bachelor work was written on mixed research basis. Quantitative research was realized using data collection from Traumacentrum České Budějovice, a. s. patient's documentation. Research included 152 patient respondents. Qualitative research was realized using half structured interviews, on which participated nurses from Traumacentrum Nemocnice České Budějovice, a. s. and patients with humerus fracture here hospitalized. The research group consisted of six patients and six nurses. Data collection took place since May 2013 to June 2014. Results: From nurse research results came out following categories: Preoperative patient care, Post-operative patient care, Rebandage specifics, Rehabilitation factors, Complications and symptoms. In preoperative patient care five of six nurses focus on pain, sensitiveness, and perfusion. In post-operative on the other hand all nurses observe coverage and pain. In complication category were mostly recorded infections, nervus radialis harm and compartment syndrome. By nervus radialis harm all nurses recorded posibility of limb functional changes. As rehabilitation factors in this category five nurses mentioned as effect of infection, pain and size of the wound. By patients came out following categories: Self-care activities: Dressing, Day routine, Motions on the bed, Hygiene, Toilet, Eating, Preferred needs. In category dressing four patients can't put on T-shirt. Regarding category of eating, here all patients recorded complications with holding the food tray. Preferred needs category reveals that all six patients values family relationships.

As percentage participation was found out that 68 % of patients are women in average age of 58 years. These data by men are 32 % and 54 years. The injury is mostly appeared considering age in women category in the age of 66 - 70, in 9, 21 %. In men category in the age of 61 - 65, in 4, 61 %. Hobby injury appeared more in men category 8, 55 %, in women category are more frequent leisure activity injuries, 64, 47 %. Conclusion: From research result we can say the nurses have great knowledge. However in all categories are knowledge gaps leaving space for knowledge supplement. Patients mostly fumble with self-care activities deficit in all spheres, this category and family relationships are most preferred categories. In qualitative research is obvious that women are twice more hospitalized with humerus fracture...|$|R
30|$|Carpal {{fractures}} besides scaphoid fractures {{are very}} rare (approx. 1 % <b>of</b> all <b>fractures)</b> and {{often difficult to}} diagnose with conventional imaging. De Zwart et al. compared SPECT/CT to planar bone scintigraphy in ten patients with carpal trauma and found more accurate anatomic description <b>of</b> <b>fractures</b> with SPECT/CT in three patients (de Zwart et al., 2015). Allainmat et al. confirmed the superiority of SPECT/CT in the detection of posttraumatic bone lesions after carpal injury (Allainmat et al., 2013). The additional use of intraarticular contrast, known as SPECT/CT arthrography, enables the evaluation of important structures like TFCC, LT ligament and SL ligament {{as well as the}} cartilage (Bhure et al., 2017). Since wrist and carpal fractures are often associated with ligament tears the combination of SPECT and CT arthrography in one imaging application allows the detection of these therapeutically relevant additional injuries (Klempka et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2013). Because arthrography is a minimally invasive procedure with very low risk of complications, such as infection, it should be applied selectively if ligament or cartilage injuries are clinically suspected. Typical <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>fractures</b> in MR are hypointense lines surrounded by bone marrow edema (Shepard et al., 2014). Querellou et al. compared SPECT/CT and MR in 52 patients and confirmed the good performance of SPECT/CT in carpal fractures (Querellou et al., 2014). They described in 6 cases fractures in SPECT/CT where corresponding MR showed only bone bruise. A capitate fracture did not occur in their series. In this presented case the fracture coincides incidentally with a bone island. Bone islands (enostosis) are benign congenital or developmental bone alterations representing compact bone within cancellous bone (Greenspan, 1995). They are typically asymptomatic incidental findings on imaging. On CT bone islands appear as alterations denser than cortex and creating a brush-like border. Prevalent anatomical localizations are femurs, hands, humeri, pelvic girdle, and ribs. The majority (75 %) of enostosis display normal uptake on planar bone scintigraphy, even if SPECT and SPECT/CT modalities have disclosed some “warm” enostosis which are inconspicuous on planar scintigraphy (Achong, 2007). Some bone islands are “hot” on bone scan and should not be misdiagnosed as malignant lesions (Greenspan et al., 1991).|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{simplified}} mechanical {{model of}} a metamict crystal swelling in a host mineral shows that enough stress is generated in the host to trigger its failure and the <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> radial <b>fractures,</b> in agreement with geological observations. The maximum stress, which combines radial compression and concentric tension, occurs along the host-inclusion interface and should create radial fractures. The maximum stress mainly depends {{on the amount of}} swelling, on the inclusion stiffness, and on the resistance to shearing of the host mineral. The external pressure, the host bulk modulus, and the inclusions/host radius ratio are parameters of minor relevance. The influence of the inclusion does not extend beyond about five times its radius. The application of published experimental data shows that a swelling metamict mineral may create significant fracturing in the host mineral. However, many parameters for both host and inclusion minerals are not available, even for the application of such a simple model. We think that in some circumstances, swelling of metamict mineral and <b>fracturing</b> <b>of</b> host mineral may significantly affect the physical properties of rocks at a larger scale by creating a network <b>of</b> <b>fractures</b> connecting metamict (i. e. uranium and thorium bearing) minerals to the geological environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} and morphological {{properties of the}} unsaturated polyester resins (UPRs) -Agave cantala roxb based composite are investigated in this paper. The cantala fiber woven in 3 D angle interlock was utilized as the composite reinforcement. Surface grafting of the cantala fiber through chemical treatment was performed by introducing silane coupling agent to improving the compatibility with the polymer matrix. The fabrication of the composite specimens was conducted using vacuum bagging technique. The effect of additional coupling agent to the morphological <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> surface <b>fracture</b> was observed using scanning electron microscopy. Meanwhile, the influence of additional silane to the mechanical properties was examined using tensile, bending and impact test. The photograph <b>of</b> surface <b>fracture</b> on the treated specimens showed the residual matrix left on the fibers in which the phenomenon was {{not found in the}} untreated specimens. Based on mechanical tests, the treated specimens were successfully increased their mechanical properties by 55 %, 9. 67 %, and 92. 4 % for tensile strength, flexural strength, and impact strength, respectively, at 1. 5 % silane coupling agent...|$|R
30|$|For {{the purpose}} of elucidating the effect of {{rheological}} property of wood on lateral tensile fracture, failure strain, elastic modulus, and creep at various temperature conditions were measured. And, relationship between the degree of softening or fluidity and lateral tensile failure strain was examined. To discuss the fracture mechanism {{from the results of}} the failure strains, broken specimens were observed and each <b>appearance</b> ratio <b>of</b> <b>fractures</b> in different tissue was calculated. The results obtained are as follows: (1) Failure strains were reduced in the temperature from 80 to 95  °C, because the weakest parts as a starting point <b>of</b> <b>fracture</b> changed in all of the specimens and the weakest parts for fractures were increased with temperature rise. (2) The effects of softening of wood are important for increasing failure strains up to the temperature range in which the fracture mechanism changes. (3) Creep deformation, that is, fluidity was included in the wood deformation process, and the fluidity had different characteristics dependent on the anatomical characteristics. It also became clear that the creep deformation measured in the load range of this study did not affect the increase in failure strain significantly.|$|R
30|$|Non-union in {{the setting}} of failed {{internal}} fixation is challenging to manage [19]. Firstly, infection must be excluded as the management of an infected non-union is fundamentally different from aseptic non-unions. Secondly, classifying these non-unions according to the traditional Weber and Cech system might not be appropriate. This classification relies on the radiographic <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fracture</b> ends to distinguish between avascular and hypervascular non-unions but fail to take account of previous fixation or adequacy of fixation [19, 20, 21]. Wu et al. [19] have suggested a revised protocol to classify femoral non-unions following internal fixation. The authors considered non-unions with stable fixation as avascular and non-unions with unstable fixation as hypervascular. Their proposed protocol underlines a need to take the non-union pathogenesis into account when considering the management strategy. In both these case examples, after plate failure, the unstable situation led to hypervascular non-unions.|$|R
