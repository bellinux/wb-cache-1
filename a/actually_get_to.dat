2500|$|Dean Devlin {{spoke out}} again on July 4, 2011 stating that he hadn't {{given up on}} the idea of sequels to his 1994 feature film. He talked about the idea again in a new {{interview}} with Collider. Devlin actually wrote it as a trilogy of movies, but was never able to do parts two and three. [...] His hope was, as the series started to wind down, that perhaps it would be time to <b>actually</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> do parts two and three.|$|E
2500|$|The singer would record {{late into}} the morning, {{sometimes}} until noon, before riding her bus to the next city. In May 2012, Rihanna revealed that whilst she was recording the album, she suffered from exhaustion, saying in part: [...] "It was the best [...] ever, it was some rock star [...] This is the craziest schedule I've ever been on in my entire life. One morning I woke up and started crying so hard. I finally just got to my bed from the IV [...] and I was just like, 'Good I can <b>actually</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> sleep tonight', because we stayed up all night' and I finished [...] at 5pm the day before..." ...|$|E

25|$|A {{question}} has been raised as just how much money donated to the charities that run the shelters <b>actually</b> <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> the homeless people and the required services. In many cases, {{there is a large}} overhead in administrative costs, which compromise the money for their homeless clients.|$|R
2500|$|For the {{remainder}} of the season, McGraw went 3–0 with a 0.57 ERA and ten saves. The Mets, meanwhile, went 20–8 from that point forward to pull off the stunning division title. At a July 9 team meeting where Mets Board Chairman M. Donald Grant was trying to encourage the team, McGraw shouted the words, [...] "Ya Gotta Believe" [...] which became a popular rallying cry for the Mets. He said the famous phrase when maybe only he believed the Mets could <b>actually</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the World Series. But soon enough, hearing McGraw say it again and again, seeing him do his magic in the ninth, the Mets themselves came to believe. They pulled into first place on September 21 with a 10–2 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates, and clinched the division crown {{on the final day of}} the season. This marked the only time between 1970 and 1980 that the National League East wasn't won by either the Philadelphia Phillies or the Pirates.|$|E
6000|$|But {{there is}} another {{literary}} project on hand, which did take effect;--much worthy of mention, this year; the whole world having risen into such a Chorus of TE DEUM at sight of it next year. In this year falls, what at any rate was a great event to Friedrich, as literary man: the printing of his first Book,--assiduous writing of it {{with an eye to}} print. The Book is that [...] "celebrated ANTI-MACHIAVEL," [...] ever-praiseworthy Refutation of Machiavel's PRINCE; concerning which there are such immensities of Voltaire Correspondence, now become, like the Book itself, inane to all readers. This was the chosen soul's employment of Friedrich, the flower of life to him, at Reinsberg, through the yea? 1739. It did not <b>actually</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> press till Spring 1740; nor actually come out till Autumn,--by which time a great change had occurred in Friedrich's title and circumstances: but we may as well say here what little is to be said of it for modern readers.|$|E

50|$|Moulin Rouge! {{is another}} modern-day film, {{in which the}} main {{character}} is a courtesan named Satine who does end up having a heart and falling in love, but ultimately (tragically) dies of tuberculosis during one of her performances and never <b>actually</b> <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> be with the one she truly loves.|$|R
50|$|A {{computer}} or calculator {{random number generator}} is used to assign plots to be sampled. Here random means an equal chance of any plot being selected {{out of all of}} the plots available. It does not mean haphazard. Often it is modified to avoid sampling roads, ensure coverage of unsampled areas and for logistics of <b>actually</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> the plots.|$|R
50|$|Shively also complimented the 3D {{rendering}} of the fights and monsters during combat. “I {{thought this was a}} pretty cool aspect, since most mobile MMORPGs feature card systems and you never <b>actually</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> see your creatures moving in 3D".|$|E
5000|$|However, after [...] "voting", he is {{very proud}} that the {{citizens}} of the United States had, through him, [...] "exercised once again their free, untrammeled franchise" [...] - a statement that is somewhat ironic as the citizens did not <b>actually</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> vote.|$|E
5000|$|... "Tactical {{voting is}} fine {{in theory and}} as an {{intellectual}} discussion {{in the drawing room}} or living rooms around the country, but when you <b>actually</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> polling day and you have to vote against your principles, then it is much harder to do." ...|$|E
5000|$|Arnall - Molly's cuckold husband. A milquetoast who {{is afraid}} of germs.

He claims his parents and {{grandmother}} made up his name because they couldn't decide whether to name him ARthur, NAthan, or LLoyd.|$|R
50|$|Finally, in Win & Spin, {{the player}} with {{the least amount of}} money at the end gets their total doubled if the person who <b>actually</b> <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> spin the wheel lands on one of 25 slots on the wheel with the Doubler 'D' symbol. Add that to the €10,000 = extra spin rule, and it makes for lots of tension on the big wheel.|$|R
5000|$|Alexandra Jacobs {{wrote in}} The New York Times that Strauss [...] "switched awkwardly between misogynistic {{comments}} and feeble attempts at self-awareness." [...] She {{also notes that}} [...] "he does come to perceive one curious thing about the PUA's: They seem far more interested in spending time with fellow PUA's, amassing, refining and discussing the game, than <b>actually</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> know women. Call them SLB's (scared little boys)." ...|$|R

5000|$|Marguerite Reardon of CNET praised Republic's [...] "cut-throat pricing", {{especially}} for consumers who only want voice and text, but faulted unreliable hand-off between Wi-Fi and cellular service, and small variety of available handsets, and said [...] "customers {{who are having}} problems with the service never <b>actually</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> speak to a real human".|$|E
5000|$|A {{round of}} combat {{is defined by}} the time it takes for every {{combatant}} to have their turn.

Group leaders may have the ability to change that. Options available to a character when their turn begins are: ...|$|E
50|$|In addition, each world {{also has}} a {{competing}} alien race {{which is trying to}} colonize the same planet. There is no option to form alliances, which means that the player's population must come into conflict with the aliens. The player never <b>actually</b> <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> see the alien city, as it is located outside the playable map, but must instead rely on espionage {{to find out what the}} aliens and their city look like.|$|R

5000|$|In 1892 he {{published}} {{an account of}} his journey [...] "to the snows of Tibet through China". This book is thought to show that Pratt did not <b>actually</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Tibet but he only got close enough to meet the missionaries who had been ejected from the country. Incidentally Pratt's book {{is thought to be}} a source for the work of Vladimir Nabokov.|$|E
5000|$|It {{might be}} a plea to {{consider}} a novel's merits as separate from that final flourish, that moment of closure. It might even be an arch challenge to the reader - the artist asking us {{how many of us}} <b>actually</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the end of the books we stockpile so smugly? These seem reasonable questions and ones that would not be so powerfully posed in prose.|$|E
50|$|It {{had taken}} Van de Velde twenty months since {{attending}} the 1852 Plenary Council and {{asking them to}} endorse his request of resignation from the See of Chicago to <b>actually</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Natchez and assume his new bishopric. His two earlier attempts to resign added {{an unknown number of}} months to those twenty. The process of his transfer to Natchez was long and arduous, and certainly exceeded the time he actually was bishop there.|$|E
40|$|With {{attempts}} to quench the cosmological constant Λ having so far failed, we instead investigate {{what could be}} done if Λ is not quenched and <b>actually</b> <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> be as big as elementary particle physics suggests. Since the quantity relevant to cosmology is actually Ω_Λ, quenching it to its small measured value is equally achievable by quenching not Λ but G instead, with the G relevant to cosmology then being much smaller than that measured in a low energy Cavendish experiment. A gravitational model in which this explicitly takes place, viz. conformal gravity, is presented, with the model being found to provide for a completely natural, non fine tuned accounting of the recent high z accelerating universe supernovae data, no matter how big Λ itself <b>actually</b> <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> be. Thus to solve the cosmological constant problem we do not need to change or quench the energy content of the universe, but rather only its effect on cosmic evolution.

Honda during the final battle. He wears dark green cargo pants instead of his boxing trunks and never <b>actually</b> <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> wear his boxing glove in the film. Balrog was voiced by Jouji Nakata in the Japanese original and Joe Romersa in the English dub.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{the arcade}} game shipped without the Pleasure Dome bonus level implemented, {{although}} there was text mentioning it in the game. The design team had not been sure that players would <b>actually</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> {{the end of the}} game. However, players did finish the game and after arcade operators informed Williams of player complaints of being unable to finish it, the company sent out a new revision that included the Pleasure Dome level.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the debate}} over the {{location}} of the new US capital, President Hamlin strongly opposed the proposal of making Philadelphia the capital, which would have alienated all the states west of the Alleghenies, and supported the finally-accepted compromise of Columbus, Ohio, which is renamed [...] "Columbia". As he declined to run in the 1864 presidential election, Hamlin did not <b>actually</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> take residence in the new capital, which was only made ready years later.|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{circumstances}} under which gravity might be repulsive rather than attractive. In particular we show why our standard solar system distance scale gravitational intuition need not be a reliable guide to the behavior of gravitational phenomena on altogether larger distance scales such as cosmological, and argue that in fact gravity <b>actually</b> <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> act repulsively on such distance scales. With such repulsion a variety of current cosmological problems (the flatness, horizon, dark matter, universe age, cosmic acceleration and cosmological constant problems) are then all naturally resolved.

50|$|GRM re-emerged in 1986 when he {{purchased}} a BMW 635 CSi from JPS Team BMW and drove it throughout that year's touring car season. The year included a win {{in one of}} the AMSCAR Series races at Amaroo Park. Rogers BMW carried sponsorship from Bob Jane T-Marts, with the car painted in Bob Jane's famous Hugger Orange. At the 1986 James Hardie 1000, Rogers teamed with Queenslander Charlie O'Brien. After qualifying 22nd, O'Brien started the race, but the car was struck down by a slipping clutch which led to its retirement after just 19 laps with Rogers not <b>actually</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> drive.|$|R
