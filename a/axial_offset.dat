40|$|A new {{real-time}} laser differential confocal microscopy (RLDCM) without sample reflectivity difference {{effects is}} proposed for imaging height topography of sample surface, which divides the confocal microscopy imaging light path into two confocal microscopy imaging paths {{before and after}} focus with the equal <b>axial</b> detector <b>offset</b> oriented in opposite direction. By dividing the difference of the two signals simultaneously detected from these two confocal imaging paths by the higher signal between these two signals, RLDCM separates the signal that comes from reflectivity heterogeneity from the topographic signal in real time for the first time. RLDCM significantly reduces the height topography imaging time by single-layer scanning for the sample surface with reflectivity heterogeneity, and it achieves high axial resolution and lateral resolution similar to CM by optimizing the <b>axial</b> detector <b>offset.</b> Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that RLDCM realizes the real-time surface imaging for line structures featuring Silicon Dioxide steps on a Silicon base and achieves 2 -nm axial depth resolution without reducing lateral resolution...|$|R

They are expected to observe the <b>axial</b> <b>offset</b> of the core, and to estimate the correct time and amount of necessary control action based on heuristic rules given in <b>axial</b> <b>offset</b> control strategies;Current control methods of axial xenon oscillations are knowledge intensive, and heuristic in nature. An expert system, ACES (<b>Axial</b> <b>offset</b> Control using Expert Systems) is developed to implement a heuristic constant <b>axial</b> <b>offset</b> control procedure to aid reactor operators in increasing the plant reliability by reducing the human error component of the failure probability;ACES is written in a production system language, OPS 5, based on the forward chaining algorithm. It samples reactor data with a certain time interval in terms of measurable parameters, such as the power, period, and the <b>axial</b> <b>offset</b> of the core. It then processes the core status utilizing a set of equations which are used in a back of the envelope calculations by domain experts. Heuristic rules of ACES identify the control variable to be used among the full and part length control rods and boron concentration, while a knowledge base is used to determine the amount of control;ACES is designed as a set of generic rules to avoid reducing the system into a set of patterns. Instead, ACES evaluates the system, determines the necessary corrective actions in terms of reactivity insertion, and provides this reactivity insertion using the control variables. The amount of control action is determined using a knowledge base which consists of the differential rod worth curves, and the boron reactivity worth of a given reactor. Having the reactor dependent parameters in its knowledge base, ACES is applicable to an arbitrary reactor for <b>axial</b> <b>offset</b> control purposes;ACES has been tested using a one-dimensional core model for verification of the rules and the code.

With the development of molecularly targeted therapies and drug combinations requiring evaluation of different schedules, the number of animals to be imaged within a PET experiment has increased. This paper describes experimental design requirements to reach statistical significance, based on the expected change in tracer uptake in treated animals {{as compared to the}} control group, the number of groups that will be imaged, and the expected intra-animal variability for a given tracer. We also review how high-throughput studies can be performed in dedicated small-animal PET, high-resolution clinical PET systems and planar positron imaging systems by imaging more than one animal simultaneously. Customized beds designed to image more than one animal in large-bore small-animal PET scanners are described. Physics issues related to the presence of several rodents within the field of view (i. e. deterioration of spatial resolution and sensitivity as the radial and the <b>axial</b> <b>offsets</b> increase, respectively, as well as a larger effect of attenuation and the number of scatter events), which can be assessed by using the NEMA NU 4 image quality phantom, are detailed...|$|R
30|$|As {{the channel}} {{registration}} holds {{at one point}} in time and at one image plane, throughout the relatively long PALM image acquisition, the registration precision is challenged by the interplay of a variation of the sample axial position and a mechanical displacement of the imaging optics of one channel with respect to the other one. Furthermore, it was demonstrated (Engelhardt et al. 2011) that, in the presence of molecular dipoles that are not free to rotate, <b>axial</b> <b>offsets</b> can result into sizable lateral offsets. This phenomenon can result in up to 2.8 nm lateral offset for 10 nm axial displacement. To alleviate these two problems an axial stabilization system was put in place. The axial stabilized system is based on a feedback system using the total internal reflection of a near-infrared laser line, a concept originally proposed by Huang et al. (Huang et al. 2008) and Pertsinidis et al. (Pertsinidis et al. 2010), and it is described in the Equipment and Settings section. As Figure 1 (b) displays, the sensitivity of this setup allows not only to avoid defocus and macroscopic blurring of the Point Spread Function (PSF) of individual emitters, but also to maintain the axial position of the sample stable to the nm-level with a 5 nm accuracy for extended periods of time.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{provides}} {{theoretical research}} of load distribution across the thread turns of the planetary roller-screw mechanism (RSM). A characteristic {{feature of the}} theoretical approach of {{the paper is the}} use of a RSM rod model with two elastic contact layers (the first layer is composed of screw-rollers, the second – of nut-rollers). A threaded mating of each elastic layer is considered as a connection with continuous turns, which is closest to the truth and consistent to classical approaches. A similar approach was applied for the ball-and-screw mechanisms with a member point contact. Thus, differential analytical closed-form equations may be used to solve this task. Based on the initial equation of compatibility of strains, <b>axial</b> <b>offsets</b> of contact layer points and the sum of screw, roller and nut turn deflections are calculated; then, load distribution across the turns may be determined. Load distribution depends both on the RSM geometry (pitch, profile angle, entry number, and thread diameter), material of threaded elements, manufacturing accuracy, and on mating friction forces. With the dependencies of load distribution across the turns of zero-clearance RSMs obtained, we have determined that maximum load is imposed on the outermost turns, which corresponds to classical solutions proposed by N.

The performance of conventional 62. 5 m di-ameter silica as well as perfluorinated plastic, graded-index MMF sections of various lengths were evaluated using 1 1, 2 2, 3 3 and 4 4 MIMO setups over a range of lengths, with both open-loop equalization and feedback-based spatial multiplexing tech-niques. The data rate was evaluated over silica fiber sections with lengths ranging between 100 m– 3 km using distributed feedback lasers and VCSELs at the transmitters. In addition, plastic optical fiber sections with lengths ranging from 1 m— 100 m were evalu-ated with Fabry Perot lasers. <b>Axial</b> <b>offsets</b> were introduced while launching into, and detecting from the MMF to enhance modal di-versity, {{and the impact of}} these offsets on the data rates was mea-sured to obtain optimal launch and detection conditions. With op-timized launch conditions and modulation parameters, the silica based systems realized data rates of 16 to 26 Gb/s, representing a bandwidth-length product improvement of over MMF stan-dards such as 10 GBASE-SR. The plastic fiber system reached data rates of 24 to 43 Gb/s, with bandwidth-length product increases of up to of rated parameters.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A large scale test rig is used to conduct an experimental investigation into the leakage resistance properties and flow characteristics of labyrinth seals. A novel test facility with multiple cavities that provides 2 D, planar flow at a scale enlargement of 100 : I is utilized. This facility uses water as the working fluid and allows real-time visual observation of experiments via large acrylic windows. Externally adjustable seal elements, also made of acrylic glass, allow each element to be moved to the desired radial and axial position. Two distinct flow visualization techniques are employed to assist in the identification of flow patterns which are beneficial to seal leakage resistance. Three classes of labyrinth seals are tested. Within each class, seals are tested over a range of Reynolds numbers, step heights, and <b>axial</b> <b>offset</b> positions (where applicable) for a fixed annular clearance. A permanent flow visualization record for each experiment is kept and analyzed in both real-time and slow motion. Statistical information is derived from the flow visualization record, and the time-mean flow field is mapped. When sudden changes in the leakage resistance properties of a seal occur, the flow visualization record is consulted to see what changes in the time-mean flow field have occurred. Furthermore, the statistical data provides information on the unsteadiness and oscillations in the instantaneous flow field. The experimental results imply that by using a combination of <b>axial</b> <b>offset</b> distance and step height, seal performance can be greatly improved. Inspection of the time-mean flow visualization images indicates that certain combinations result in greater serpentining. Seals that exhibit a moderate amount of serpentining generally had greater leakage resistance. Furthermore, it was found that larger step heights tend to amplify the effect that the <b>axial</b> <b>offset</b> has on serpentining. Conversely, however, it was observed that decreasing the clearance diminished the effect that <b>axial</b> <b>offset</b> has on leakage resistance. The statistical information obtained from the flow visualization seemed to have some correlation to the leakage resistance of a seal, however, the lack of a more comprehensive data set limits the conclusions that can be inferred...|$|E
40|$|<b>Axial</b> <b>offset</b> anomaly (AOA) in {{pressurized}} water reactors {{refers to the}} presence of a significantly larger measured negative <b>axial</b> <b>offset</b> deviation than predicted by core design calculations. The neutron flux depression in the upper half of high-power rods experiencing significant subcooled boiling is believed to be caused by the concentration of boron species within the crud layer formed on the cladding surface. Recent investigations of the root-cause mechanism for AOA [1, 2] suggest that boron build-up on the fuel is caused by precipitation of lithium metaborate (LiBO 2) within the crud in regions of subcooled boiling. Indirect evidence in support of this hypothesis was inferred from operating experience at Callaway, where lithium return and hide-out were, respectively, observed following power reductions and power increases when AOA was present. However, direct evidence of lithium metaborate precipitation within the crud has, heretofore, not been shown because of its retrograde solubility. To this end, this investigation has been undertaken in order to directly verify or refute the proposed root-cause mechanism of AOA, and examine the effectiveness of possible mitigating actions to limit its impact in high power PWR cores...|$|E

The thesis {{is concerned with the}} theory of thin-walled beams of open section. The aim is to formulate a general beam element for analysis of this type of structure. Thus a general stiffness matrix for the element, and a transformation matrix for loads and displacements with respect to centroid and shear centre were derived, by taking into consideration the value of-bimoment due to an <b>axial</b> force <b>offset</b> from the shear centre. Internal forces including bimoments, and global displacements including warping were calculated, and the stress distributions on the cross-sections of a beam at each-element node, were evaluated. The problem of buckling of thin-walled beams was treated using a finite strip program which was formulated to solve problems with the following combination of stresses: a) Linearly distributed axial stresses b) Uniform lateral stresses c) Uniform shear streses The results for beams of cruciform, box and channel sections, under uniform axial stresses and linearly distributed axial stresses, also accounting for flexural stresses, were conpared with other theoretical and some experimental results. The agreement was satisfactory. A series of, laboratory tests on beams of channel sections under compression were carried out.

40|$|Mineral {{compositions}} {{of residual}} peridotites collected at various {{locations in the}} Mid-Atlantic Ridge south of the Kane transform (MARK area) are consistent with generally smaller degrees of melting in the mantle near the large offset Kane transform than near the other, small <b>offset,</b> <b>axial</b> discontinuities in the area. We propose that this transform fault effect is due to along-axis variations in the final depth of melting in the subaxial mantle, reflecting the colder thermal regime of the ridge near the Kane transform. Calculations made with a passive mantle flow regime suggest that these along-axis variations in the final depth of melting would not produce {{the full range of}} crustal thickness variations observed in the MARK area seismic record. It is therefore likely that the transform fault effect in the MARK area is combined with other mechanisms capable of producing crustal thickness variations, such as along-axis melt migration, the trapping of part of the magma in a cold mantle root beneath the ridge, or active mantle upwelling...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, PWR core thermal margins have {{decreased}} because of higher enrichment of U- 235 in the fuel assemblies to achieve higher discharge burnup, higher core power to improve economical competiveness, and reduction of fast neutron leakage to prevent rapid ageing {{of the pressure}} vessel. Thus, a new uranium-thorium-based fuel assembly is proposed for improving the thermal margins. The proposed fuel is simulated for the Swedish Ringhals- 3 PWR equilibrium core in a realistic demonstration. The difference between the uranium-thorium and traditional fuel assemblies is the fuel pellets composition. In the uranium-thorium fuel assembly, 7 weight percentage of thorium oxide is added {{to some of the}} fuel pellets. In those fuel pellets, the enrichment is kept below 5 % enrichment of U- 235 in order to avoid extra certification on transport, management and storage. The two most significant results showed in this paper are the improved pin peak power, and the <b>axial</b> <b>offset</b> in the core. The pin peak power margin could be improved by 75 % by using the uranium-thorium-based fuel compared with the reference core containing traditional fuel assemblies. The maximum <b>axial</b> <b>offset</b> was decreased by 33 % using the uranium-thorium-based fuel compared with the reference core.

40|$|Crustal {{accretion}} at fast-spreading mid-ocean ridges {{is believed}} to be concentrated in a narrow zone up to a few kilometers wide centered beneath the ridge axis. However, there is increasing evidence for off-axis magmatism occurring beyond this narrow zone. Here, we present 3 D multichannel seismic (MCS) images from the East Pacific Rise 9 ° 37 – 40 ′N extending to 11 km on the ridge flanks. In the <b>axial</b> region, two <b>offset</b> <b>axial</b> magma bodies underlie a small ridge-axis discontinuity at ∼ 9 ° 37 ′N, displaying an overlapping geometry {{similar to that of the}} seafloor structures above. On the ridge flanks, a series of off-axis magma lenses (OAML) are imaged: they are located 2 – 10 km from the ridge axis, at 700 to 1520 ms two-way travel time below seafloor (bsf) (∼ 1. 6 to 4. 5 km bsf), with variable areas ranging from 0. 5 km 2 to 5. 2 km 2. The largest body is centered 4 km east of the ridge axis and is composed of a large, continuous, flat-topped lens and a series of small, discontinuous, westward-dipping bodies along its western edge. The flat crest of the OAML lies at approximately the same depth beneath layer 2 A as the axial magma lens and we infer that this OAML has formed by aggregation of ascending melts that accumulate at the base of the sheeted dike section. A cluster of reflections underlying the OAML at 1260 – 1510 ms bsf are observed that may be deeper lenses feeding melts to the upper lens. This largest OAML is associated with Moho travel time anomalies of 120 – 260 ms within a zone that extends up to 2 km from the edge of the OAML, suggesting a lower crust that is partially molten with lower crustal velocities reduced by 8 – 18 % and/or thicker than normal by up to 1 km. Local volcanic edifices are found above two of the three OAMLs imaged in our study area and are inferred to be the eruptive products of the OAMLs. From the volume of these edifices and the Moho travel time anomalies we estimate the potential contribution of off-axis magmatism to the total volume of the crust to be ∼ 0. 01 – 3 %. The OAMLs imaged in our study area are present over roughly the same distance range as the zone of formation of near-axis seamounts. We speculate that OAMLs and the volcanic edifices found above them are small-scale manifestations of the off-axis magmatism that gives rise to near-axis seamounts...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the biomechanical {{behavior}} of using two versus three locking screws per bone segment in a cadaveric humerus fracture gap model. Methods: Six matched pairs of elderly osteoporotic fresh–frozen human cadaveric humerii were used. An eight-hole locking compression plate was placed posteriorly on the humeral shaft and secured with either four or six bicortical locking screws. A 5 -mm middiaphyseal gap osteotomy was created to simulate a comminuted fracture without bony contact. Specimens were tested in <b>offset</b> <b>axial</b> compression, four-point anteroposterior bending, four-point medial– lateral bending, and torsion. After the initial testing in each of these modalities, the constructs were cyclically loaded in torsion and again tested in the four loading modalities. Lastly, the fixation constructs were then tested to failure in torsion. Results: There were no significant differences in stiffness between the group fixed with two screws per segment and the group fixed with three screws per segment. The peak torque to failure was higher in the four-screw construct compared with the six-screw construct. The mean torque to failure was 23. 5 ± 3. 7 Nm in the construct with two locking screws per segment compared with 20. 4 ± 2. 8 Nm in the construct with three locking screws per segment (P = 0. 030). Conclusions: The addition of a third screw in the locked plate construct did not add to the mechanical stability in axial loading, bending, or torsion. In testing to failure, the addition of a third screw resulted in lower load to failure...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{influence}} of the drying process in developing fiber properties during the dry-jet wet spinning of poly (p-phenylene benzobisthiazole) is undertaken. The fiber 2 ̆ 7 s structure and mechanical characteristics from the coagulated state through the drying process to the as-spun and heat treated state are investigated herein. ^ The wet fiber is composed of a swollen macro and microfibrillar network of highly oriented molecules with lateral but no longitudinal order and exhibits a high degree of mechanical anisotropy. The structural and mechanical features of the as-spun fiber appear to develop during coagulation. ^ The drying process during drying is characterized by a distinct radial contraction and axial elongation due to the porous and anisotropic nature of the coagulated fiber. Alterations in the structure and mechanics of PBT fibers are observed upon drying which is rationalized in terms of the collapse process. The drying process is a fiber modification phase. ^ High temperature and tension are employed to optimize the driving force toward property enhancement during the drying stage. Tension during drying straightens the wet fibrillar network while <b>offsetting</b> <b>axial</b> compressive internal stresses whereas the use of high temperature increases the extent of the lateral molecular order and increases molecular orientation resulting in enhanced tensile properties. ^ The compressive strength and shear modulus increase after drying suggesting that removal of water may serve to enhance lateral interactions within the swollen fibrillar network inhibiting shear and compressive deformation and the onset of buckling instabilities. Further increases in the compressive strength through high tension and temperature drying are not achieved since further enhancements in intermicrofibrillar and fibrillar associations are speculated to be minimal. ^ A force-temperature (F-T) technique is implemented to study thermal expansion characteristics of these rigid rod aromatic fibers through examination of the reversible F-T behavior. Subsequent mass loss and microstructural changes during the F-T experiment (an effective post processing heat treatment) is detected from irreversible F-T effects. An assessment of the effectiveness of the initial drying and heat treatment processing to induce thermal stability and material alterations is obtained through this F-T technique. ...|$|R
