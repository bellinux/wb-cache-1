5|$|The {{year after}} US 113 <b>Alternate</b> was assigned, State Street through Dover was reconstructed and widened and {{construction}} began {{on a new}} bridge for US 13 and US 113 <b>Alternate</b> across Silver Lake. The hazardous, narrow causeway was replaced with a four-lane, brick-lined, reinforced concrete triple-arch bridge, and State Street between the bridge {{and the beginning of}} the US 13 divided highway at US 113's northern terminus was widened to four lanes, in 1937. The intersection of US 113 and US 113 <b>Alternate</b> at Little Heaven was reconstructed as a directional intersection in 1956. After US 13's bypass of Dover was completed in 1952, the northern termini of US 113 and US 113 <b>Alternate</b> remained north of Dover until 1974, when AASHTO approved moving the northern terminus of US 113 to the junction of US 13 and Bay Road. The organization also approved removing US 113 <b>Alternate</b> from State Street north of US 13 and instead following US 13 to US 113's northern terminus.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we generalize {{the concept of}} <b>alternating</b> knots to <b>alternating</b> graphs and show that every {{abstract}} graph has a spatial embedding that is <b>alternating.</b> We also prove that every spatial graph is a subgraph of an <b>alternating</b> graph.

Moreover, no closed incompressible pairwise incompressible surface exists in the complement of an <b>alternating</b> graph. We then generalize results of Kauffman, Murasugi, and Thistlethwaite to prove that the crossing number of an even-valent rigid-vertex <b>alternating</b> spatial graph is realized in every reduced <b>alternating</b> projection with no uncrossed cycles and, if the graph is not 2 -composite, the crossing number is not realized in any non-alternating projection. We give examples showing that this result does not hold for graphs with vertices of odd valence or graphs with uncrossed cycles...|$|R

40|$|Automata on {{infinite}} {{words are}} used for specification and verification of nonterminating programs. Different types of automata induce different levels of expressive power, of succinctness, and of complexity. <b>Alternating</b> automata have both existential and universal branching modes and are particularly suitable for specification of programs. In a weak <b>alternating</b> automaton, the state space is partitioned into partially ordered sets, and the automaton can proceed from a certain set only to smaller sets. Reasoning about weak <b>alternating</b> automata is easier than reasoning about <b>alternating</b> automata with no restricted structure.
