25|$|Churchill also {{restricted}} Jewish {{migration to}} an <b>annual</b> <b>quota</b> {{decided by the}} British. Certificates allowing migration were distributed by the Jewish Agency. Jews with 1000 Pounds in cash or Jewish professionals with 500 Pounds in cash could emigrate freely. Churchill's reforms made it hard for Arab Jews, Orthodox Jews and Revisionist Zionists from Poland to migrate to Palestine as the Jewish Agency was dominated by European Zionists, and increasingly by Socialist Zionists. Immigration restrictions did, however mean that Jewish immigrants to Palestine had to prove their loyalty and dedication by spending years preparing for migration. Many immigrants arrived after rigorous preparation including agricultural and ideological training and learning Hebrew.|$|E
25|$|Currently, the <b>annual</b> <b>quota</b> for {{the gray}} whale {{catch in the}} region is 140 per year. Pursuant to an {{agreement}} between the United States and Russia, the Makah tribe of Washington claimed four whales from the IWC quota established at the 1997 meeting. With the exception of a single gray whale killed in 1999, the Makah people have been prevented from hunting by a series of legal challenges, culminating in a United States federal appeals court decision in December 2002 that required the National Marine Fisheries Service to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement. On September 8, 2007, five members of the Makah tribe shot a gray whale using high-powered rifles in spite of the decision. The whale died within 12 hours, sinking while heading out to sea.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand has an <b>annual</b> <b>quota</b> of 75 Tuvaluans granted work permits {{under the}} Pacific Access Category, as {{announced}} in 2001. The applicants register for the Pacific Access Category (PAC) ballots; the primary criteria {{is that the}} principal applicant must have a job offer from a New Zealand employer. Tuvaluans also have access to seasonal employment in the horticulture and viticulture industries in New Zealand under the Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) Work Policy introduced in 2007 allowing for employment of up to 5,000 workers from Tuvalu and other Pacific islands. Tuvaluans can participate in the Australian Pacific Seasonal Worker Program, which allows Pacific Islanders to obtain seasonal employment in the Australian agriculture industry, in particular cotton and cane operations; fishing industry, in particular aquaculture; and with accommodation providers in the tourism industry.|$|E
40|$|PresentationITQ systems {{generate}} ITQ prices. For {{any given}} ITQ-managed species there are typically two prices. One {{is for the}} <b>annual</b> (or seasonal) <b>quota,</b> the other is for the longer lasting ITQ-share. In well-functioning ITQ markets, these prices reveal important information about the fishery. In the single species framework, prices of <b>annual</b> <b>quotas</b> measure the current profitability of fishing and prices for ITQ-shares reflect the expected future profitability of fishing under the ITQ system. Trading arbitrage leads to a determinate functional relationship between the prices of <b>annual</b> quantity <b>quotas</b> and that of TAC-shares. In the multi-species framework, if the ability to select the species composition of the harvest is less than perfect, the information content of the ITQ-prices is much less straight-forward. For instance the price of <b>annual</b> <b>quotas</b> for a given species may, under not uncommon circumstances, far exceed its landings price or, alternatively, be approximately zero. This paper explores these issues. It derives explicit expressions ITQ prices under various circumstances including the multi-species context with imperfect selectivity, discarding possibilities and ITQ-noncompliance. To illustrate the issues, empirical data on ITQ prices in Iceland are presented...|$|R

25|$|In Britain, {{dissection}} remained entirely prohibited {{until the}} 16th century, when {{a series of}} royal edicts gave specific groups of physicians and surgeons some limited rights to dissect cadavers. The permission was quite limited: by the mid-18th century, the Royal College of Physicians and Company of Barber-Surgeons {{were the only two}} groups permitted to carry out dissections, and had an <b>annual</b> <b>quota</b> of ten cadavers between them. As a result of pressure from anatomists, especially in the rapidly growing medical schools, the Murder Act 1752 allowed the bodies of executed murderers to be dissected for anatomical research and education. By the 19th century this supply of cadavers proved insufficient, as the public medical schools were growing, and the private medical schools lacked legal access to cadavers. A thriving black market arose in cadavers and body parts, leading {{to the creation of the}} profession of body snatching, and the infamous Burke and Hare murders in 1828, when 16 people were murdered for their cadavers, to be sold to anatomists. The resulting public outcry led to the passage of the Anatomy Act 1832, which increased the legal supply of cadavers for dissection.|$|E
500|$|The western North Atlantic {{porbeagle}} {{population has}} a more positive prospect than in the eastern North Atlantic. Fishing in Canadian waters was originally regulated by the 1995 Fisheries Management Plan for pelagic sharks in Atlantic Canada, which established an <b>annual</b> <b>quota</b> of 1,500 tons, restricted the time, place, and gear types allowed for commercial fishing, and set limits for bycatch and recreational fishing. In 2000–2001, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) prepared a detailed population model and concluded that a quota of 200–250 tons would allow for population growth, resulting in a quota of 250 tons being adopted {{for the period of}} 2002–2007. The mating ground off of Newfoundland was also closed to shark fishing. [...] In 2004, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) listed the porbeagle as Endangered, largely {{on the basis of the}} low population abundance (<25% of original numbers). Canada decided not to list the species under its Species At Risk Act, but further reduced the total fishing quota to 185 tons. [...] In US waters, the 1993 Fishery Management Plan for Sharks of the Atlantic Ocean sets an <b>annual</b> <b>quota</b> of 92 tons (post-processing) for the porbeagle. In 2006, this species was listed as a Species of Concern by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), meaning that it merits conservation concern but there is insufficient data for inclusion on the US Endangered Species Act.|$|E

2500|$|The Spanish {{forces and}} their allies {{advanced}} into the city. Despite inflicting heavy casualties, the Aztecs could not halt the Spanish advance. While the fighting in the city raged, the Aztecs cut out and ate the hearts of 70 Spanish prisoners-of-war at the altar to Huitzilopochtli. By August, many of the native inhabitants had fled Tlatelolco. Cortés sent emissaries {{to negotiate with the}} Tlatelolcas to join his side, but the Tlatelolcas remained loyal to the Aztecs. Throughout the siege, the Tlaxcalans waged a merciless campaign against the Aztecs who had long oppressed them as for hundreds of years the Tlaxcalans had been forced to hand over an <b>annual</b> <b>quota</b> of young men and women to be sacrificed and eaten at the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan, and now the Tlaxcalans saw their chance for revenge. The American historian Charles Robinson wrote: [...] "Centuries of hate and the basic viciousness of Mesoamerican warfare combined in violence that appalled Cortés himself". In letter to the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, [...] Cortés wrote: [...] "We had more trouble in preventing our allies from killing with such cruelty than we had in fighting the enemy. For no race, however savage, has ever practiced such fierce and unnatural cruelty as the natives of these parts. Our allies also took many spoils that day, which we were unable to prevent, as they numbered more than 150,000 and we Spaniards only some nine hundred. Neither our precautions nor our warnings could stop their looting, though we did all we could...I had posted Spaniards in every street, so that when the people began to come out [...] they might prevent our allies from killing those wretched people, whose numbers was uncountable. I also told the captains of our allies that on no account should any of those people be slain; but there were so many that we could not prevent more than fifteen thousand being killed and sacrificed [...] that day".|$|E
