25|$|In {{the story}} of Breuddwyd Macsen Wledig (English: The Dream of Emperor Maximus), he is Emperor of Rome and marries <b>a</b> <b>wondrous</b> British woman, telling her that she may name her desires, to be {{received}} as a wedding portion. She asks that her father be given sovereignty over Britain, thus formalising the transfer of authority from Rome back to the Britons themselves. The marriage also makes possible British descendants, a point not lost on medieval kings. The earliest Welsh genealogies give Maximus the role of founding father for several royal dynasties, including those of Powys and Gwent, a role he also played for the rulers of medieval Galloway in Scotland, home to the Roman-era Novantae whose territory was also made independent of Roman rule by Maximus. He is given as the ancestor of a Welsh king on the Pillar of Eliseg, erected nearly 500 years after he left Britain, and he figures in lists of the Fifteen Tribes of Wales.|$|E

500|$|Anna Popplewell as Susan Pevensie, {{the second}} oldest Pevensie. Popplewell had been {{disappointed}} she barely used her {{bow and arrow}} in the first film. Adamson convinced Douglas Gresham to have her present during the battles by suggesting her passive role in the novel indicated Lewis' view of women before he met Joy Gresham. [...] "I think [...] cast women down in the earlier books, {{but when you look}} at The Horse and His Boy, it has a strong female character. Doug's mother was a strong woman." [...] Adamson also chose to have her fall for Caspian, because [...] "The kids are growing up. If you look at Ben and you look at Anna, it seems really implausible that they wouldn't have some feelings for each other." [...] He knew it had to be [...] "sensitively handled" [...] though, and ultimately it is not about romance, but [...] " [...] the fact that you can have <b>a</b> <b>wondrous</b> experience, enjoy it and move on". Popplewell added that it would not make sense for the Narnians not to use Susan, a talented archer, in battle, and that the romance contributed to her character's reconciliation with losing Narnia in the first place.|$|E
500|$|Eric Kohn of IndieWire {{praised the}} {{beginning}} of the season for being [...] "irreverent and narratively engaging". He called it [...] "the ideal testament to animation's glorious pliability in an commercial arena otherwise defined by restrictions." [...] Kohn felt that the show's exploration of [...] "sad subtext"—such as the series' mysterious Mushroom War and the relationship between Marceline and the Ice King—and the characters' abilities to [...] "deny the bad vibes their surrounding world invites" [...] via [...] "cheery songs and vibrant artwork" [...] were some of the series strongest points. He was particularly pleased with the season opener, calling it an [...] "interesting creative challenge". Kohn later published an article explaining why [...] "'Adventure Time' is the best Sci-Fi show on TV right now". He singled out [...] "Simon & Marcy", praising the way in which the episode [...] "deepen the world [...] in all kinds of morbidly fascinating ways." [...] Furthermore, he compared the entry to Cormac McCarthy's book The Road, specifically citing the similarities between the mutant creatures in the episode and the [...] "demented people" [...] in the latter. Kohn ultimately concluded that the series' [...] "willingness to contemplate [...] while sticking to its unique combination of silliness and haunting beauty routinely transforms the show into <b>a</b> <b>wondrous</b> genre experiment." ...|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert gave a very {{positive}} review. [...] "Superman is a pure delight, <b>a</b> <b>wondrous</b> combination of all the old-fashioned things we never really get tired of: adventure and romance, heroes and villains, earthshaking special effects and wit. Reeve is perfectly cast in the role. Any poor choice would have ruined the film." [...] Ebert placed the film on his 10 best list of 1978. He would later go on to place it on his [...] "Great Movies" [...] list. James Berardinelli believed [...] "there's no doubt that it's a flawed movie, but it's {{one of the most}} wonderfully entertaining flawed movies made during the 1970s. It's exactly what comic book fans hoped it would be. Perhaps most heartening of all, however, is the message {{at the end of the}} credits announcing the impending arrival of Superman II." [...] Harry Knowles is a longtime fan of the film, but was critical of elements that did not represent the Superman stories as seen in the comics. Dave Kehr felt [...] "the tone, style, and point of view change almost from shot to shot. This is the definitive corporate film. It is best when it takes itself seriously, worst when it takes the easy way out in giggly camp. When Lex Luthor enters the action, Hackman plays the arch-villain like a hairdresser left over from a TV skit." [...] Neal Gabler similarly felt that the film focused too much on shallow comedy. He also argued that the film should have adhered more to the spirit of Mario Puzo's original script, and referred to the first three Superman films collectively as [...] "simply puffed-up TV episodes." ...|$|E

[...] Indeed, Utzon was inspired to design the church when he was lying on a Hawaii beach, shortly after his premature departure from Australia as a result of disagreements over the Sydney Opera House. Contemplating a regular succession of cylindrical clouds, he concluded that they provided a perfect basis for modelling a church ceiling.|$|E
