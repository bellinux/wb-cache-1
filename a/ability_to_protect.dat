5|$|Elizabeth {{ordered the}} Burmese Ruby Tiara in 1973, {{and it was}} made by Garrard & Co. using stones from her private collection. It is {{designed}} {{in the form of}} a wreath of roses, with silver and diamonds making the petals, and clusters of gold and rubies forming the centre of the flowers. A total of 96 rubies are mounted on the tiara; they were originally part of a necklace given to her in 1947 as a wedding present by the people of Burma (now Myanmar), who credited them with having the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> their owner from sickness and evil. The diamonds were also given to her as a wedding present, by the Nizam of Hyderabad and Berar, who possessed a vast jewellery collection of his own.|$|E

The 2007 findings also emphasized the need to determine the most likely areas of spawning, to identify any parasite or disease that may be impacting the reproductive capabilities of pallid sturgeon, and to examine engineering possibilities that may permit recreation of suitable habitats without reducing the USFWS's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> people from harmful and destructive flooding, and to maintain its ability to provide adequate water impoundment for irrigation and recreation purposes.|$|E
5|$|Dredd persuaded {{new chief}} judge McGruder {{to permit the}} {{citizens}} to vote in a referendum on whether democratic government should be restored, or the existing Judge System should be retained. McGruder agreed because the Judges had lost much of their credibility in failing to protect the citizens from the Dark Judges during Necropolis: since the Judges' argument in favour of their dictatorial rule rested largely on their allegedly unique <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the city and preserve order (which the last elected government had conspicuously failed to do), the Democrats' calls for reform were consequently more compelling than ever. The Democracy Referendum was scheduled for 2113, and was not popular among the rank-and-file judges, or even the senior ranks, since almost everybody predicted that the unpopular Judges would lose the vote by a landslide. So much did the Referendum depend on Dredd's personal support that Judge Grice and other judges even tried to assassinate him to prevent the vote from going ahead.|$|E

25|$|The Constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was, at the time, in some dispute as it {{applied to}} the private sector. In the {{landmark}} Civil Rights Cases the United States Supreme Court had ruled, in 1883, that Congress {{did not have the}} power to prohibit discrimination in the private sector, thus stripping the Civil Rights Act of 1875 of much of its <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> civil rights.|$|E

25|$|Meyer {{has been}} criticized by feminists who {{consider}} Meyer an antifeminist writer, saying that the series romanticizes a physically abusive relationship, pointing to red flags that include Bella's entire life revolving around Edward; never being in control of her own life; being absolutely dependent on Edward's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> her life, her virginity, and her humanity; and the physical injuries Bella suffers from finally consummating her relationship with Edward. Meyer has dismissed such criticisms, saying both that the books center around Bella's choice, and that her damsel in distress persona is due only to her humanity.|$|E
25|$|Titanium dioxide {{is found}} in the {{majority}} of physical sunscreens because of its high refractive index, its strong UV light absorbing capabilities and its resistance to discolouration under ultraviolet light. This advantage enhances its stability and <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the skin from ultraviolet light. Nano-scaled (particle size of 30–40nm) titanium dioxide particles are primarily used in sun screen lotion because they scatter visible light less than titanium dioxide pigments while still providing UV protection. Sunscreens designed for infants or people with sensitive skin are often based on titanium dioxide and/or zinc oxide, as these mineral UV blockers are believed to cause less skin irritation than other UV absorbing chemicals.|$|E
25|$|Although the Constitution of Iraq recognizes Islam as the {{official}} religion and states that no law may be enacted that contradicts the established provisions of Islam, it also guarantees freedom of thought, conscience, and religious belief and practice. While the Government generally endorses these rights, unsettled conditions have prevented effective governance {{in parts of the}} country, and the Government's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> religious freedoms has been handicapped by insurgency, terrorism, and sectarian violence. Since 2003, when the government of Saddam Hussein fell, the Iraqi government has generally not engaged in state-sponsored persecution of any religious group, calling instead for tolerance and acceptance of all religious minorities.|$|E

25|$|The Halieutica is a fragmentary didactic poem in 134 poorly {{preserved}} hexameter {{lines and}} is considered spurious. The poem begins by describing how every animal possesses the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> itself and how fish use ars to help themselves. The ability of dogs and land creatures to protect themselves is described. The poem goes on to list the places best for fishing, and which types of fish to catch. Although Pliny the Elder mentions a Halieutica by Ovid, which was composed at Tomis {{near the end of}} Ovid's life, modern scholars believe Pliny was mistaken in his attribution and that the poem is not genuine.|$|E
25|$|Across Europe, {{popular culture}} viewed magical {{abilities}} as either innate or learned; in Friulian folk custom, the benandanti {{were seen as}} having innate powers marked out at birth. Specifically, it was a widely held belief that those who in later life became benandanti were born with a caul, or amniotic sac, wrapped around their heads. In the folklore of Friuli at the time, cauls were imbued with magical properties, being associated with the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> soldiers from harm, to cause an enemy to withdraw, and to help lawyers win their legal cases. In subsequent centuries, a related folkloric tradition found across much of Italy held {{to the belief that}} witches had been born with a caul.|$|E
25|$|Because it {{encompasses}} many species-rich ecosystems for animals, fungi and plants, Brazil houses {{many thousands}} of species, with many (if not most) of them still undiscovered. Due to the relatively explosive economic and demographic rise {{of the country in}} the last century, Brazil's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> its environmental habitats has increasingly come under threat. Extensive logging in the nation's forests, particularly the Amazon, both official and unofficial, destroys areas {{the size of a small}} country each year, and potentially a diverse variety of plants and animals. However, as various species possess special characteristics, or are built in an interesting way, some of their capabilities are being copied for use in technology (see bionics), and the profit potential may result in a retardation of deforestation.|$|E

25|$|There is {{scientific}} concern that extended spaceflight might {{slow down the}} body's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> itself against diseases. Radiation can penetrate living tissue and cause both short and long-term damage to the bone marrow stem cells which create the blood and immune systems. In particular, it causes 'chromosomal aberrations' in lymphocytes. As these cells {{are central to the}} immune system, any damage weakens the immune system, which means that in addition to increased vulnerability to new exposures, viruses already present in the body—which would normally be suppressed—become active. In space, T-cells (a form of lymphocyte) are less able to reproduce properly, and the T-cells that do reproduce are less able to fight off infection. Over time immunodeficiency results in the rapid spread of infection among crew members, especially in the confined areas of space flight systems.|$|E
25|$|Estimates of {{waters and}} wetland acreage {{likely to be}} removed from the section 404 {{permitting}} program {{as a result of the}} SWANCC decision are very difficult to assess, in part because of questions about Corps and EPA interpretation of the ruling, but the decision may affect up to 79% of wetland acreage. One likely result is that case-by-case evaluations will then be required to determine if regulatory jurisdiction exists, the length of time to obtain section 404 permits will be longer than in the past. If federal jurisdiction is diminished, the responsibility to protect affected wetlands falls on states and local governments. A comprehensive picture of their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> wetlands, under various possible state and local authorities, is difficult to draw together. Whether states will act to fill in the gap left by removal of some federal jurisdiction by new laws or programs raises difficult political and resource questions.|$|E
25|$|The {{root cause}} of FAP is {{understood}} to be a genetic mutation—a flaw in the body's tumour suppressor genes that prevent development of tumours. The flaw allows numerous cells of the intestinal wall to develop into potentially cancerous polyps when they would usually {{reach the end of}} their life; inevitably one or more will eventually progress and give rise to cancer (7% risk by age 21, rising to 87% by age 45 and 93% by age 50). The flawed genes do not trigger cancer, but rather, they reduce the body's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> against the risk of aged cells becoming cancerous. Even with the flawed gene, it may still take time before a cell actually does develop that is cancerous as a result, and the gene may in some cases still partially operate to control tumours, therefore cancer from FAP takes many years to develop and is almost always an adult-onset disease.|$|E
40|$|Urocanic acid (UCA) {{is present}} at millimolar {{concentrations}} in mammalian epidermis and undergoes photoisomerization from the naturally occurring trans-isomer to the cis-isomer on exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR). Cis-UCA causes downregulation of various immune responses in mouse and human experimental models {{and has been}} proposed as both a chromophore and a mediator of UV-induced immune suppression. In this study, the wavelength dependence from 260 – 340 nm for trans to cis-UCA photoisomerization in human skin was analyzed in five healthy volunteers. The resulting action spectrum demonstrated maximal cis-UCA production in the UVB spectral region of 280 – 310 nm. This spectral peak is red-shifted to longer wavelengths compared with the erythemal action spectrum. The cis-UCA action spectrum can be used <b>to</b> predict the <b>ability</b> of sunscreens <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> against UVR-induced cis-UCA formation and may assist in explaining discrepancies between sunscreens' <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> against erythema and photoimmunosuppression...|$|R

25|$|A {{number of}} states without {{wetlands}} laws on their books still have other state environmental laws dealing with water quality or natural resources, and they may already provide substantial authority to regulate wetlands. However, a comprehensive picture of states' <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> wetlands, under various possible authorities, is difficult to draw together. To {{fill in the gap}} left by removal of some federal regulatory jurisdiction, states could adopt more comprehensive wetlands regulatory statutes or wetland amendments to state pollution control statutes (possibly including independent water quality certification programs) and rules. The latter, for example, could integrate wetlands, water quality, and watershed management. States do not have the constitutional constraints that the federal government does in enacting legislation (whether a legislative action exceeds Congress' power under the Commerce Clause). Also, CWA section 404(t) expressly provides that the existence of section 404 does not preempt state law governing the discharge of dredged or fill material. However, whether states will take steps to expand wetlands protection in response to the Court's decision raises difficult political and resource questions. It is quite likely that, among states, the SWANCC decision pleases some states and is opposed by others.|$|E
25|$|This defeat {{handicapped}} Berengar {{and caused}} the nobility to question his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> Italy. As a result, they supported another {{candidate for the}} throne, the aforementioned Louis of Provence, another maternal relative of the Carolingians. In 900, Louis marched into Italy and defeated Berengar; the following year he was crowned Emperor by Pope Benedict IV. In 902, however, Berengar struck back and defeated Louis, making him promise never to return to Italy. When he broke this oath by invading the peninsula again in 905, Berengar defeated him at Verona, captured him, and ordered him to be blinded on 21 July. Louis returned to Provence and ruled for another twenty years as Louis the Blind. Berengar thereby cemented his position as king and ruled undisputed, except for a brief spell, until 922. As king, Berengar made his seat at Verona, which he heavily fortified. During the years when Louis posed a threat to Berengar's kingship, his wife, Bertilla, who was a niece of the former empress Engelberga, Louis's grandmother, played {{an important part in}} the legitimisation of his rule. She later disappeared from the scene, as indicated by her absence in his charters post-905.|$|E
25|$|The {{removal of}} wolves and the grizzly bear in California may have greatly reduced the {{abundance}} of the endangered San Joaquin Kit Fox. With the reintroduction of gray wolves to Yellowstone, many visitors have witnessed a once common struggle between a keystone species, the grizzly bear, and its historic rival, the gray wolf. The interactions of grizzly bears with the wolves of Yellowstone have been under considerable study. Typically, the conflict {{will be in the}} defense of young or over a carcass, which is commonly an elk killed by wolves. The grizzly bear uses its keen sense of smell to locate the kill. As the wolves and grizzly compete for the kill, one wolf may try to distract the bear while the others feed. The bear then may retaliate by chasing the wolves. If the wolves become aggressive with the bear, it is normally in the form of quick nips at its hind legs. Thus, the bear will sit down and use its <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> itself in a full circle. Rarely do interactions such as these end in death or serious injury to either animal. One carcass simply is not usually worth the risk to the wolves (if the bear has the upper hand due to strength and size) or to the bear (if the wolves are too numerous or persistent). While wolves usually dominate grizzly bears during interactions at wolf dens, both grizzly and black bears have been reported killing wolves and their cubs at wolf dens even when the latter was in defense mode.|$|E

50|$|In regions {{below the}} tree line, nannies use their {{fighting}} <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> {{themselves and their}} offspring from predators. Predators, including wolves, wolverines, lynxes, and bears, attack goats of most ages given the opportunity. The cougar is perhaps the primary predator, being powerful enough to overwhelm the largest adults and uniquely nimble enough to navigate the rocky ecosystem of the goats. Though their size protects them from most potential predators in higher altitudes, nannies must sometimes defend their young from golden eagles, {{which can be a}} predatory threat to kids. Nannies have even been observed trying to dominate the more passive, but often heavier bighorn sheep that share some of their territory.|$|R
