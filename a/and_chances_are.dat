40|$|Time <b>and</b> <b>chance</b> <b>are</b> the {{intellectual}} coordinates {{of a new}} knowledge of natural reality founded on phenomena characterised by ‘becoming’: entropic molecular processes, radioactive atomic processes, chemical processes, chaotic dynamic systems and biological evolution, are all paridigms in which time <b>and</b> <b>chance</b> act as “operators”. The intertwining of time <b>and</b> <b>chance</b> <b>is</b> tightened by the intermediation of a statistical component, depending {{on the number of}} degrees of freedom, which is a phenomenal condition linked to empirical processes and to the directions of the time arrow which points towards an increasing probability. Chance breaks the symmetry of time; by making the ‘becoming’ irreversible, it links the microworld to the macroworld and offers an image of nature where order and disorder, causality and casualty, certainty and uncertainty coexist. Thus, the meeting of time <b>and</b> <b>chance</b> <b>is</b> not an antithesis but rather a dialectic process or, better yet, a statistical hendiadys...|$|R

30|$|Beliefs about luck <b>and</b> <b>chance</b> Although {{wishing for}} good fortune and good health is universal, beliefs about luck, winning <b>and</b> <b>chance</b> <b>are</b> {{influenced}} by culture. For example, Chinese gamblers {{believe in a}} cyclical change of luck, that ebbs and flows and is independent of human action. This belief may contribute to their higher risk-taking (Papineau 2005). Vietnamese-Australian gamblers explain luck and winning in gambling as karma; previous good deeds to others would bring gambling wins; whereas, bad deeds would bring bad luck (Ohtsuka and Ohtsuka 2010). There is also evidence that some beliefs about luck <b>and</b> <b>chance</b> <b>are</b> universal. For example, a belief that hard work would bring desirable outcomes or a belief in a “just world”, that bad luck in the past would be rewarded with a big win someday, is found across cultures (Ohtsuka 2013).|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this essay}} was {{to find out whether}} opportunity, {{possibility}} <b>and</b> <b>chance</b> could <b>be</b> considered synonymous and if and when they are interchangeable. Articles, native speakers of English as informants, definitions from five English dictionaries and the computerized British National Corpus have been used to define the meaning and usage of the three terms. It has been shown that Swedes overuse possibility. The three terms have been said to have different connotations. The native speakers’ attitude towards the choice between opportunity, possibility <b>and</b> <b>chance</b> showed that it is often a matter of personal opinion whether one of the terms is chosen. The dictionaries together with the corpus show that the terms may sometimes, but not always, be regarded as synonyms. The present study suggests that chance covers more meanings than either opportunity or possibility and could be said to cover a larger semantic domain. This essay shows that opportunity, possibility <b>and</b> <b>chance</b> <b>are</b> interchangeable in some contexts but this often implies a slight change of meaning. The semantic domains of opportunity, possibility <b>and</b> <b>chance</b> <b>are</b> partly entwined <b>and</b> share a semantic area (see front picture). They also cover different semantic areas: opportunity in the work/educational/career area, possibility in the scientific/research area <b>and</b> <b>chance</b> as the most colloquial of the terms, the one which is used in most idioms and informal expressions.

The line is often played by White players hoping for an early draw, but there is still a lot of play left in the position. White tries to exploit d6 with moves such as b4, c5, Nf3-d2-c4-d6, etc., while Black will play to control the hole on d4. In practice, it is easier to exploit d4, <b>and</b> <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> balanced.

For {{the most part}} the tone of the pianist remains almost frigid in its consistency; volume level rarely varies and the direction of the improvisations is solidly mainstream... The obvious problem with someone like Bley or Jimi Hendrix is that once they developed their totally unique musical personality, their earlier work starts to sound a little boring". The Penguin Guide to Jazz said [...] "At this stage of his career, he's a very orthodox bopper, aware of the blues but certainly not restricted by them, possibly exploring aspects of Tristano's evolution as well, and certainly listening to classical pianists for technique and harmonic ideas".|$|E
