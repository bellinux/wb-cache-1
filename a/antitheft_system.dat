50|$|The {{base model}} had 4-lug, 15-inch wheels, a softer suspension, and no rear sway bar. The base model had several options and {{features}} available to be fitted {{to the car}} such as leather seats, ABS, & a viscous limited-slip differential. SE and LE models came equipped with 5-lug, 16-inch alloy wheels, a stiffer suspension than the base model, and a rear sway bar. The LE was basically an upgraded SE model, but with more standard equipment such as leather seats, keyless entry, an <b>antitheft</b> <b>system,</b> and a CD player. Antilock brakes and a viscous limited-slip differential could be had as an optional package to both base and SE/LE models.|$|E
40|$|Abstract – In 2011 prepaid card toll {{collection}} {{was introduced in}} India. This Electronic {{toll collection}} system avoids wastage of time and little bit good management also. But It does not provide security as anyone can utilize that card. Hence motivation behind our project is to provide efficient time utilization, good management and <b>antitheft</b> <b>system</b> also. RFID has an unique identity number. Every vehicle will be given an unique number, all information will be transferred and toll payment will also be done. For security purpose also RFID can be used. Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is the advanced technology with wireless use to transfer data, {{for the purposes of}} automatically identifying and tracking tags attached to objects. Message of amount of toll will also be given to owner of the vehicle using GSM. In this paper avoidance of use of Prepaid card is the feature. So In this paper we describe automatic toll collection using RFID...|$|E

With new inexpensive printed memory, {{it will be}} possible to manufacture cheap surveillance tags that are capable to tell the user if something has happened within a timeline. This project is within the ITC FrameProgram 7 founded project PriMeBits. The goal is to imple‐ment a write once read many memory (WORM) onto an RF‐tag together with a sensor that can sense wetness, which can be detected by EAS <b>antitheft</b> <b>systems.</b> Pre researches have been done in the fields printed capacitance, coils and WORMs, all printed with silver ink. Before implementation of a WORM onto a tag simulations and laboratory tests with adjustable resistances were made. Two different circuit models are simulated and tested. When connected to a tag and the WORM is un‐programmed, the EAS system should not trigger an alarm. But if the WORM is programmed by the sensor, the alarm should trigger. Results show that capacitances and WORMs are printable with this technique but coils are not due to high inner resistance. The simulations show that a tag built as an LCCR‐circuit is the best choice. This is also confirmed with tests done with real resistors. With WORMs connected to a tag the results show that approximately 70 % of them work as intended, this is because the WORMs as of now are not completely developed. The conclusion of this project is that it is possible to implement a WORM onto a tag with further research, to make an inexpensive surveillance tag. PriMeBit...|$|R
40|$|<b>Antitheft</b> {{security}} <b>system</b> {{security system}} using AT&T COMMAND utilizes an embedded system design with GSM {{to monitor and}} safeguard a car. It secures the car against theft. Upon activation, it automatically demobilizes the car by disconnecting the ignition key supply from the car battery. This now {{makes it impossible for}} anybody so starts the car, let alone moving with it. In an attempt of theft through the car doors or boot, the system sends text message to the car owner {{and at the same time}} starts up an alarm. This design popped out due to the increasing rate at which packed cars are stolen especially in our country, but with this design this packed car is being monitored irrespective of where it is packed, provided there is GSM network coverage. From the research conducted, it was found out that majority of the existing car security system uses only alarm, and doesn’t send text message to the car owner let alone of demobilizing the car. But with the use of GSM network, the owner is guaranteed that the car will send text message to his phone, and at the same time, have people around alerted of what is happening. Added to this is that the car will not be move because it has been demobilized. The use of AT&T COMMAND made the design use very few electronics component, look very small and compact that it can be hardly seen when mounted in the car [2]...|$|R
