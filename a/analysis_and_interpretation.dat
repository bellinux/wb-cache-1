This has been accomplished through <b>analysis</b> <b>and</b> <b>interpretation</b> of injury and fatality data development of injury prevention resources, and research to advance prevention of MVCs and resulting injuries in high-risk populations. NIOSH seeks to effect change through a variety of mechanisms: communication of research results through the peer-reviewed literature and industry channels, safety information targeted to employers and workers, changes in government regulations, and development of voluntary consensus standards.|$|E
