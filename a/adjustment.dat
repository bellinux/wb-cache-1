40|$|Online {{movement}} <b>adjustments</b> {{are crucial}} for daily life. This {{is especially true}} for leg movements in relation to gait, where failed <b>adjustments</b> can lead to falls, especially in elderly. However, most research has focused on reach <b>adjustments</b> following changes in target location. This arm research reports two categories of online <b>adjustments</b> (see Gaveau et al., Neuropsychologia 55 : 25 - 40, 2014 for review). Small, frequently undetected, target location shifts invoke fast, automatic <b>adjustments,</b> usually without awareness. In contrast, large target location shifts can lead to slow, voluntary <b>adjustments.</b> These fast and slow <b>adjustments</b> presumably rely on different neural networks, with a possible role for subcortical pathways for the fast responses. Do leg movement <b>adjustments</b> also fall into these two categories? We review the literature on leg movement <b>adjustments</b> and show that it is indeed possible to discern fast and slow <b>adjustments.</b> More specifically, we provide an overview of studies showing <b>adjustments</b> during step preparation, initiation, unobstructed, and obstructed gait. Fast <b>adjustments</b> were found both during stepping and gait. In the extreme case, even step <b>adjustments</b> appear to be further modifiable online, e. g., when avoiding obstacles during tripping. In older adults, movement <b>adjustments</b> are generally slower and of smaller magnitude, consistent with a greater risk of falling. However, fast responses seem less affected by aging, consistent with the idea of independent parallel mechanisms controlling movement <b>adjustments</b> (Gomi, Curr Opin Neurobiol 18 : 558 - 567, 2008). Finally, putative neural pathways are discussed...|$|R

25|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, {{international}} organizations began {{to admit that}} structural <b>adjustment</b> policies were worsening life for the world's poor.

Drawing upon the structure of the Assessment Accommodations Checklist and {{more than a decade of}} accessibility research, the Checklist of Learning and Assessment <b>Adjustments</b> for Students (CLAAS) was developed to help teachers select and document <b>adjustments</b> that support SWDs and students with additional needs in classroom instruction and assessment, and external tests. The CLAAS was trialled with 21 primary school teachers documenting <b>adjustments</b> for 89 students with diverse needs. Teachers indicated that the CLAAS provided a comprehensive list of <b>adjustments,</b> was useful for recording <b>adjustments</b> across classroom instruction and assessment, and external tests, and provided guidance about potential <b>adjustments</b> for SWDs or with additional learning needs. The documented <b>adjustments</b> also indicated some considerable gaps between supports provided in classrooms compared with the Australian educational accountability tests. Findings also provided initial evidence for the reliability and validity of use of the CLAAS for its intended purposes. The CLAAS is a promising tool for helping both researchers and teachers systematically document and provide equitable and inclusive <b>adjustments</b> for SWDs and additional learning needs given their needs for classroom learning, assessment and external testing and examination requirements...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of {{positive}} fair value <b>adjustments</b> on dividend policy. If fair value <b>adjustments</b> are transitory in nature and managers are able to assess their implications for future earnings, fair value <b>adjustments</b> in net income is expected to have no distribution consequences. However, positive fair value <b>adjustments</b> may lead to higher dividends when management incorrectly assesses their persistence. This can have a procyclical impact because higher dividends increase leverage, and thus risk. We use a Russian setting that mandates fair value accounting for financial instruments and requires disclosure of unrealised fair value <b>adjustments</b> in income. We find no empirical support for the concern that dividends increase in response to positive fair value <b>adjustments.</b> Rather, there is a negative relationship between positive fair value <b>adjustments</b> and dividend changes, which holds after controlling for dividend policy determinants and any endogenous nature of the revaluation decision. We discuss several possible explanations for this finding...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} <b>adjustments</b> of selective attention following errors and {{their relation to}} the error-related negativity (Ne/ERN), a correlate of errors in event-related potentials.

To test this, a four-choice flanker task was used in which errors due to insufficient selective attention (flanker errors) and other errors (nonflanker errors) could be distinguished. We found strong <b>adjustments</b> of selective attention following flanker errors but not following nonflanker errors. Moreover, the Ne/ERN amplitude was correlated with <b>adjustments</b> of selective attention on a trial-by-trial basis.
