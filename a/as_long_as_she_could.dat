25|$|As {{a generous}} {{patron of the}} arts, Marguerite befriended and {{protected}} many artists and writers, among them François Rabelais (1483–1553), Clément Marot (1496–1544), Claude de Bectoz (d. 1547) and Pierre de Ronsard (1524–1585). Also, Marguerite served as a mediator between Roman Catholics and Protestants (including John Calvin). Although Marguerite espoused reform within the Catholic Church, {{she was not a}} Calvinist. She did, however, do her best to protect the reformers and dissuaded Francis I from intolerant measures <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> After her death, eight religious wars occurred in France, marked notably by the notorious St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre of 1572.|$|E
2500|$|Campbell entered office {{facing a}} {{statutory}} general election. [...] She waited <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> before asking Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn to dissolve Parliament on September 8, only weeks before Parliament {{was due to}} expire. The election was scheduled for October 25, the latest date it could be legally held under Section 4 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.|$|E
2500|$|The tale has {{an abrupt}} ending. Opinions vary {{on whether the}} ending was the {{intended}} ending of the author. Arthur Waley, who made the first English translation of the whole of The Tale of Genji, believed that the work as we have it was finished. Ivan Morris, author of The World of the Shining Prince, {{believed that it was}} not complete, with later chapters missing. [...] Edward Seidensticker, who made the second translation of the Genji, believed that it was not finished, and that Murasaki Shikibu would not have had a planned story structure with an [...] "ending", and would simply have gone on writing <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b>|$|E
60|$|A Snob <b>she</b> is, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{sets that}} prodigious value upon herself, upon her name, upon her outward appearance, and indulges in that {{intolerable}} pomposity; <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> goes parading abroad, like Solomon {{in all his}} glory; <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> goes to bed--as I believe she does--with a turban and a bird of paradise in it, and a court train to her night-gown; <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> is so insufferably virtuous and condescending; <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> does not cut {{at least one of}} those footmen down into mutton-chops {{for the benefit of the}} young ladies.|$|R
60|$|Carol never, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> lived, forgot Ruth's face at that moment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, of course," [...] {{she murmured}} in deep humiliation. If he had {{suffered}} her to be silent <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> would, she might have offered him some reparation; but he spoke.|$|R
2500|$|Kirner {{went into}} 1992 knowing she faced a {{statutory}} general election, one which opinion polls gave her virtually {{no chance of}} winning. [...] She waited <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> finally calling an election for October. [...] It was obvious {{as soon as the}} writs were dropped that Labor would not win a fourth term. [...] Although she remained personally more popular than the Liberal Opposition Leader, Jeff Kennett, it was not nearly enough to overcome the electorate's anger at her party. The Coalition's [...] "Guilty Party" [...] campaign did much to stoke this anger, targeting many Ministers in the Kirner Government and providing examples of concerns in their portfolios.|$|E
2500|$|Brennan {{turned down}} the {{internship}} and decided to leave Apple. She stated that Jobs told her [...] "If you give up this baby for adoption, you will be sorry" [...] and [...] "I am never going to help you." [...] Now alone, Brennan was on welfare and cleaning houses to earn money. She would sometimes ask Jobs for money but he always refused. Brennan hid her pregnancy for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> living {{in a variety of}} homes and continuing her work with Zen meditation. At the same time, according to Brennan, Jobs [...] "started to seed people with the notion that I slept around and he was infertile, which meant that this could not be his child." [...] A few weeks before she was due to give birth, Brennan was invited to deliver her baby at the All One Farm and she accepted the offer. When Jobs was 23 (the same age as his biological parents when they had him) Brennan gave birth to her baby, Lisa Brennan, on May 17, 1978.|$|E
60|$|I was now quite myself again, and Polly {{had evidently}} made her story <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> {{to allow me}} to recover myself, and to divert my {{thoughts}} a little from my great joy.|$|E

60|$|When she withdrew to {{the little}} chamber, the Rainbow's Daughter began conversing with the Witch, whom she urged {{to stay with the}} new queen and protect her <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> ruled the Pink Country. Rosalie, who longed to please the {{powerful}} Polychrome, whose fairy powers as Daughters of the Rainbow were far superior to her own witchcraft, promised faithfully to devote herself to Queen Mayre <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> might need her services.|$|R
60|$|Yet for her principles' {{sake and}} Dolly's, she never let Harvey Kynaston or his wife suspect it; <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> lived, {{she was a}} true and earnest friend at all times to both of them.|$|R
60|$|But Mr. Turnbull came now to meet her; {{a medical}} {{man is the}} good angel of the troubled house, and Maggie ran toward the kind old friend, whom she {{remember}}ed <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> remember anything, with a trembling, questioning look.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{would never}} suit my daughter," [...] Mrs. Forsyth lugged in, {{partly because the}} talk had gone on away from her family <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> endure, and partly because Charlotte's indecision always amused her. [...] "She can't bear to choose." ...|$|E
60|$|He studied its sparse {{supplies}} with care. There was {{not much}} to do with, but he boiled some eggs and made coffee very quietly, with intent to let his mother sleep <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> He found himself less savage than the night before.|$|E

6000|$|... "The famous History?" [...] cried Anne. The {{writing and}} the {{printing}} of this Magnum Opus {{had been going on}} <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> remember. All her childhood long Uncle Henry's History had been a vague and fabulous thing, often heard of and never seen.|$|E
6000|$|For {{some little}} time, they {{traveled}} in silence--alone in the railway carriage. After submitting <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> to lay an embargo {{on the use}} of her tongue, Mrs. Ellmother started the conversation by means of a question: [...] "Do you think Mr. Mirabel will get over it, miss?" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{inclined}} {{her head}} slightly in acknowledgment of his bow, and he whirled {{out of the room}} and down the dim narrow passageway into the arms of Mrs. Pasmer, who had resisted <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> her curiosity to know what the angry voices of himself and Alice meant.|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, there wa'n't no hurry, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she's</b> he'a," [...] he said, in prompt {{enjoyment}} of the joke, and he and Clementina sparely kissed each other.|$|R
60|$|I did not wake Rectus to {{tell him}} the news. It would not do any good, and I was afraid Corny might hear us. I wanted her to sleep <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> and, indeed, I dreaded the moment when she should awake, and find that all had been given up.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have little}} enough to atone for, madam," [...] said Tom, as he busied himself about the sufferer. He saw that all {{would soon be}} over, and would have had Mrs. Vavasour withdraw: {{but she was so}} really good a nurse <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> control herself, that he could hardly spare her.|$|E
6000|$|...

50|$|As {{a member}} of his team, Thunderblast would display a {{significant}} crush on her new commander, which Megatron would treat with indifference <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> remained a willing pawn.|$|R
6000|$|She was {{definitely}} {{sorry to hear}} that they were to leave at nine that evening, and she clung to them <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> She took them to St. Mark's for dinner.

6000|$|... "Yes, {{yours and}} your mother's, and the lady's also,--for against her has the fault been most grievous. I shall write {{to your mother}} and express my contrition."

60|$|That her {{grandfather}} could offer any opposition {{had not occurred}} {{to her as a}} possibility. She took his approval for granted.
