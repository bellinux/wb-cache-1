5|$|An Octopus card may be {{returned}} to any MTR Customer Service Centre for a refund of the remaining credit stored on it. A handling fee may be charged for the refund — HK$7 for an <b>anonymous</b> On-Loan card {{that had been in}} use for fewer than three months, and HK$10 for a Personalised On-Loan card that was issued on or after 1 November 2004. A refund is immediately provided at the time an <b>anonymous</b> On Loan card is returned, unless it has more than HK$500 stored on it. A Personalised On-Loan card or an <b>anonymous</b> On-Loan card with more than HK$500 stored on it needs to be sent back to Octopus Cards Limited for refund processing, in which case, the refund for a Personalised On-Loan card would be available in eight days, and that of an <b>anonymous</b> On-Loan card would be available in five days. If a damaged card is returned for refund, a HK$30 levy would be charged to the cardholder.|$|E

5|$|<b>Anonymous</b> is {{the first}} internet-based super-consciousness. <b>Anonymous</b> is a group, {{in the sense that}} a flock of birds is a group. How do you know they’re a group?

5|$|<b>Anonymous</b> {{is tired}} of {{corporate}} interests controlling the internet and silencing the people’s rights to spread information, but more importantly, the right to SHARE with one another. The RIAA and the MPAA feign to aid the artists and their cause; yet they do no such thing. In their eyes is not hope, only dollar signs. <b>Anonymous</b> will not stand this any longer.|$|E

5|$|I will confess {{up front}} that I love <b>Anonymous,</b> {{but not because}} I think they're the heroes. Like Alan Moore's {{character}} V who inspired <b>Anonymous</b> to adopt the Guy Fawkes mask as an icon and fashion item, you're never quite sure if <b>Anonymous</b> is the hero or antihero. The trickster is attracted to change {{and the need for}} change, and that's where <b>Anonymous</b> goes. But they are not your personal army – that's Rule 44 – yes, there are rules. And when they do something, it never goes quite as planned. The internet has no neat endings.|$|E

5|$|The Church of Scientology {{sought an}} {{injunction}} and {{a restraining order}} to prevent <b>Anonymous</b> from protesting on March 15, 2008, citing threats allegedly made by <b>Anonymous.</b> Both the injunction and the restraining order were denied. On March 31, 2008, Radar Online reported that representatives of law firms delivered legal letters to suspected Anons, often at their homes. The Church filed complaints of trespassing and criminal harassment against Boston organizer Gregg Housh, who was charged with disturbing an assembly of worship, disturbing the peace, and harassment. The District Attorney's office dropped the harassment charge, and Judge Thomas Horgan issued a continuance without finding for the remaining charges.|$|E
5|$|The DDoS {{attacks were}} at first {{carried out with}} the Gigaloader and JMeter {{application}}s. Within a few days, these were supplanted by the Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC), a network stress-testing application allowing users to flood a server with TCP or UDP packets. The LOIC soon became a signature weapon in the <b>Anonymous</b> arsenal; however, it would also lead {{to a number of}} arrests of less experienced Anons who failed to conceal their IP addresses. Some operators in <b>Anonymous</b> IRC channels incorrectly told or lied to new volunteers that using the LOIC carried no legal risk.|$|E
5|$|The Winkler County nurse {{whistleblower}} {{case was}} a series of legal proceedings in West Texas that centered on the retaliation upon two nurses who submitted an <b>anonymous</b> state medical board complaint against a physician in 2009.

After witnessing what they believed to be unsafe medical care, nurses Anne Mitchell and Vicki Galle submitted an <b>anonymous</b> complaint against Dr. Rolando Arafiles to the Texas Medical Board (TMB).|$|E

5|$|After the Stuxnet attack, Kaspersky {{proposed}} that the Internet needed more regulation and policing. One idea was to have {{some parts of the}} Internet <b>anonymous,</b> while more secure areas require user identification. He argued that anonymity mostly benefited cybercriminals and hackers. For example, accessing a nuclear power plant network could require a verified identity through a digital passport.|$|E
5|$|Also in August 2014, 4chan was {{involved}} in the Gamergate controversy, which began with unsubstantiated allegations about indie game developer Zoë Quinn from an ex-boyfriend, followed by false allegations from <b>anonymous</b> Internet users.

5|$|By {{the fall}} 1998 {{annual meeting of}} the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, held in Utah, United States, rumors were {{circulating}} about a striking fossil of a primitive bird that was in private hands. This fossil was presented by an <b>anonymous</b> dealer at a gem show in Tucson, Arizona. The Dinosaur Museum in Blanding, Utah, purchased it in February 1999. The museum is run by Stephen A. Czerkas and his wife, Sylvia Czerkas. Mr. Czerkas does not hold a university degree, but he is a dinosaur enthusiast and artist. He arranged for patrons of his museum, including trustee Dale Slade, to provide $80,000 for the purchase of the fossil, in order to study it scientifically and prevent it from disappearing into an <b>anonymous</b> private collection.|$|E
