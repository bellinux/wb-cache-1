A recent example, TM-align, uses a novel method for weighting its distance matrix, to which standard dynamic programming is then applied. The weighting is proposed to accelerate the convergence of dynamic programming and correct for effects arising from alignment lengths. In a benchmarking study, TM-align {{has been reported to}} improve in both speed and accuracy over DALI and CE.|$|E

5|$|Many drug {{molecules}} are enzyme inhibitors, {{so their}} discovery and improvement is an <b>active</b> <b>area</b> {{of research in}} biochemistry and pharmacology. A medicinal enzyme inhibitor is often judged by its specificity (its lack of binding to other proteins) and its potency (its dissociation constant, which indicates the concentration needed to inhibit the enzyme). A high specificity and potency ensure that a drug will have few side effects and thus low toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{conditions}} that inhibit consciousness are considered disorders of consciousness. This category generally includes minimally conscious state and persistent vegetative state, but sometimes {{also includes the}} less severe locked-in syndrome and more severe chronic coma. Differential diagnosis of these disorders is an <b>active</b> <b>area</b> of biomedical research. Finally, brain death results in an irreversible disruption of consciousness. While other conditions may cause a moderate deterioration (e.g., dementia and delirium) or transient interruption (e.g., grand mal and petit mal seizures) of consciousness, they {{are not included in}} this category.|$|E

5|$|Qeshm Island {{is part of}} the Simply Folded Belt, {{the most}} seismically active part of the Zagros fold and thrust belt. Similar to most {{earthquakes}} in the area, the 2005 event resulted from reverse slip faulting. Since it lies in such a seismically <b>active</b> <b>area,</b> there is a high risk of destructive earthquakes in Iran; 1 in 3,000 deaths are attributable to earthquakes. One geophysicist has cited the lack of strict building codes as a serious concern.|$|E

However, modifications to the reaction focused on remedying its issues continue to be an <b>active</b> <b>area</b> of academic research. In particular, the research has focused on a few key areas: rendering the reaction catalytic in the promoter, effecting the reaction with more mild promoters to improve functional group tolerance, directing the regioselectivity of the elimination step, and improving the overall stereoselectivity. These have been successful to varying degrees.|$|E
5|$|The {{whole of}} Scotland {{was covered by}} ice sheets during the Pleistocene ice ages and the {{landscape}} is much affected by glaciation, {{and to a lesser}} extent by subsequent sea level changes. In the post-glacial epoch, circa 6100 BC, Scotland and the Faeroe Islands experienced a tsunami up to 20 metres high caused by the Storegga Slides, an immense underwater landslip off the coast of Norway. Earth tremors are infrequent and usually slight. The Great Glen is the most seismically <b>active</b> <b>area</b> of Britain, but the last event of any size was in 1901.|$|E

5|$|Volcanism in the NCVP can {{be traced}} {{as far back as}} 20 million years ago with the {{emplacement}} of alkali basalt in western Yukon. Several types of volcanic eruptions have since created different landforms across the NCVP, including shield volcanoes, lava domes, stratovolcanoes and cinder cones. Other volcanic formations, notably subglacial volcanoes, take their shape from the environment they formed in regardless of what magma type they produced. The NCVP contains over 100 volcanoes and is the most volcanically <b>active</b> <b>area</b> in Canada, with eruptions expected to occur roughly every 100 years.|$|E
5|$|Biogeography has a {{long history}} in the natural {{sciences}} concerning the spatial distribution of plants and animals. Ecology and evolution provide the explanatory context for biogeographical studies. Biogeographical patterns result from ecological processes that influence range distributions, such as migration and dispersal. and from historical processes that split populations or species into different areas. The biogeographic processes that result in the natural splitting of species explains much of the modern distribution of the Earth's biota. The splitting of lineages in a species is called vicariance biogeography and it is a sub-discipline of biogeography. There are also practical applications in the field of biogeography concerning ecological systems and processes. For example, the range and distribution of biodiversity and invasive species responding to climate change is a serious concern and <b>active</b> <b>area</b> of research in the context of global warming.|$|E
5|$|In physics, mirror {{symmetry}} {{is justified}} on physical grounds. However, mathematicians generally require rigorous proofs {{that do not}} require an appeal to physical intuition. From a mathematical point of view, the version of mirror symmetry described above is still only a conjecture, but there is another version of mirror symmetry in the context of topological string theory, a simplified version of string theory introduced by Edward Witten, which has been rigorously proven by mathematicians. In the context of topological string theory, mirror symmetry states that two theories called the A-model and B-model are equivalent in the sense that there is a duality relating them. Today mirror symmetry is an <b>active</b> <b>area</b> of research in mathematics, and mathematicians are working to develop a more complete mathematical understanding of mirror symmetry based on physicists' intuition.|$|E

40|$|Properties as temperatures, sublimation, and {{outgassing}} rates, {{are determined}} for different surface parameters {{to model the}} surface of the nucleus of comet 19 P/Borrelly. The derived outgassing properties indicate that only about 6 % of the day-side surface of this cometary nucleus can be expected to contribute to the astronomically observed gas production rate. This is in agreement with DS- 1 imaging and thermal measurement results. The small value of the day-side <b>active</b> <b>areas</b> indicates a Halley-type surface of only locally restricted <b>active</b> <b>areas</b> or zones, while most of the surface is passive but hot with maximum temperatures above 300 K. Thus, it is expected that the comet surface is mainly covered by a hot upper surface layer of refractory materials. The temperature of the local <b>active</b> <b>areas</b> with free sublimation is expected in the range of about 200 K...|$|R
5|$|Darwin's {{interest}} on the biology of reef organisms was focussed on aspects related to his geological idea of subsidence; in particular, {{he was looking for}} confirmation that the reef building organisms could only live at shallow depths. FitzRoy's soundings at the Keeling Islands gave a depth limit for live coral of about 20fathoms (37m), and taking into account numerous observations by others, Darwin worked with a probable limit of 30fathoms (55m). Modern findings suggest a limit of around 100m, still {{a small fraction of the}} depth of the ocean floor at 3000â€“5000m. Darwin recognised the importance of red algae, and he reviewed other organisms that could have helped to build the reefs. He thought they lived at similarly shallow depths, but banks formed at greater depths were found in the 1880s. Darwin reviewed the distribution of different species of coral across a reef. He thought that the seaward reefs most exposed to wind and waves were formed by massive corals and red algae; this would be the most <b>active</b> <b>area</b> of reef growth and so would cause a tendency for reefs to grow outwards once they reach sea level. He believed that higher temperatures and the calmer water of the lagoons favoured the greatest coral diversity. These ecological ideas are still current, and research on the details continues.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} {{has emerged}} as a highly successful model of gravitation and cosmology, which has so far passed many unambiguous observational and experimental tests. However, there are strong indications the theory is incomplete. The problem of quantum gravity and the question of the reality of spacetime singularities remain open. Observational data that is taken as evidence for dark energy and dark matter could indicate the need for new physics. Even taken as is, general relativity is rich with possibilities for further exploration. Mathematical relativists seek {{to understand the nature of}} singularities and the fundamental properties of Einstein's equations, while numerical relativists run increasingly powerful computer simulations (such as those describing merging black holes). In February 2016, it was announced that the existence of gravitational waves was directly detected by the Advanced LIGO team on September 14, 2015. A century after its introduction, general relativity remains a highly <b>active</b> <b>area</b> of research.|$|E
5|$|No.6 Squadron next saw {{action in}} late 1944. From late October {{it and the}} other units of No.71 Wing {{conducted}} attacks on Rabaul and other locations in New Britain to support the Australian 5th Division's Landing at Jacquinot Bay and subsequent operations on the island. Between December 1944 and January 1945, No.6 Squadron moved to Dobodura airfield, from where it continued to support Australian Army operations in New Britain and the Aitapeâ€“Wewak area of New Guinea. There were few targets within range of Dobodura, however, and the squadron saw little combat during 1945. Despite the limited nature of the raids conducted from Dobodura, the squadron's offensive operations were hampered by a shortage of bombs. A detachment of six aircraft was deployed to Tadji between late April and 13 May to participate in attacks on Japanese positions near Wewak alongside Beauforts from No.7, No.8, No.15 and No.100 Squadrons. The squadron conducted little operational flying from late May, and in June its commander recommended in his monthly report that No.6 Squadron be either disbanded or re-equipped and sent to a more <b>active</b> <b>area.</b> RAAF Headquarters {{did not respond to}} this proposal, and many other Australian squadrons were similarly under-employed at the time. The squadron's last combat operations were undertaken by a detachment of two Beauforts which were deployed to Biak during July; these aircraft bombed Japanese positions in the area alongside P-40 Kittyhawks operated by No.120 (NEI) Squadron. Following {{the end of the war}} the squadron dropped leaflets to advise Japanese troops that their country had surrendered and continued to make anti-submarine patrols. In September all of the squadron's aircrew were posted to units located further from Australia and were replaced by aircrew from these squadrons. The squadron also began regular courier flights between Dobodura and Milne Bay during the month. No.6 Squadron remained at Dobodura until 18 October 1945, when it returned to Australia and was disbanded at Kingaroy, Queensland on the 31st of the month. The squadron suffered 35 fatalities during World War II.|$|E
