40|$|For higher-derivative f(R) gravity where R is the Ricci scalar, a {{class of}} models is {{proposed}} which produce viable cosmology different from the LambdaCDM one at recent times and satisfy cosmological, Solar system and laboratory tests.

A 'smoking gun' for these models would be small discrepancy in values of the slope of the primordial perturbation power spectrum determined from galaxy surveys and CMB fluctuations.

40|$|We have designed, synthesized, crystallized, and {{performed}} x-ray analysis of several hydrophobic tripeptides that show an extended near alpha-helical {{structure in the}} crystalline state. All of the tripeptides that show this remarkably stable helix crystallize {{with two or three}} water molecules; they all have glycine at the N terminus and have increasing hydrophobicity as one moves from the N to C terminus. Even though three residues in the oligomer are not sufficient to complete a turn, one of the water molecules acts as an added residue and links up adjacent tripeptide segments along the helix axis so that in the crystal, the helix <b>appears</b> <b>effectively</b> as one long continuous helix. Two of these tripeptides are stabilized by two water molecules that enable the peptides to complete a turn of the helix and extend the helical structure throughout the crystal by linking translationally related peptides by hydrogen bonds. In two other peptides, these roles are played by three rather than two water molecules. Though these tripeptides have different crystal symmetry, they all show the basic pattern of hydrated helix and packing, indicating the strong conformational preference for a stable structure even for these tripeptides. Such conformationally stable hydrated structures for short specific related sequences illustrate their possible importance in nucleating protein folding and in the role water molecules play in such events...|$|E

It is positioned above the coordinates of longitude 00 and latitude 00 on an axis parallel to that of the poles of the Earth.

Spiral arms are among the structures predicted by models of disk–planet interaction and thus {{it is tempting to}} suspect that planetary perturbers are responsible for these signatures. However, such interpretation is not free of problems. The observed spirals have large pitch angles, and in at least one case (HD 100546) it <b>appears</b> <b>effectively</b> unpolarized, implying thermal emission of the order of 1000 K (465 ± 40 K at closer inspection). We have recently shown in two-dimensional models that shock dissipation in the supersonic wake of high-mass planets can lead to significant heating if the disk is sufficiently adiabatic. Here we extend this analysis to three dimensions in thermodynamically evolving disks. We use the Pencil Code in spherical coordinates for our models, with a prescription for thermal cooling based on the optical depth of the local vertical gas column. We use a 5 M_J planet, and show that shocks in the region around the planet where the Lindblad resonances occur heat the gas to substantially higher temperatures than the ambient gas. The gas is accelerated vertically away from the midplane to form shock bores, and the gas falling back toward the midplane breaks up into a turbulent surf. This turbulence, although localized, has high α values, reaching 0. 05 in the inner Lindblad resonance, and 0. 1 in the outer one. We find evidence that the disk regions heated up by the shocks become superadiabatic, generating convection far from the planet's orbit...|$|E

40|$|A simple {{mathematical}} model of GRB pulses in time, suggested in Norris et al. (2005), is extended across energy. For a class of isolated pulses, two of those parameters <b>appear</b> <b>effectively</b> independent of energy. Specifically, statistical fits indicate that pulse amplitude A and pulse width τ are energy dependent, while pulse start time and pulse shape are effectively energy independent. These results bolster the Pulse Start and Pulse Scale conjectures of Nemiroff (2000) and add a new Pulse Shape conjecture which states that a class of pulses {{all have the same}} shape. The simple resulting pulse counts model is P(t,E) = A(E) exp (-t/τ(E) - τ(E) /t), where t is the time {{since the start of the}} pulse. This pulse model is found to be an acceptable statistical fit to many of the fluent separable BATSE pulses listed in Norris et al. (2005).

Symmetry arguments are used to design orthogonal isotope labeling patterns so that the barrier for the CD 3 compound {{can be measured in}} the presence of the CH 3 compound. This scheme eliminates the differential uncertainty in the temperature measurement by allowing both barriers to be measure in the same sample, which in turn reduces the error in determining the differential barrier.
