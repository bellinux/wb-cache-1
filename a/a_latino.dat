5|$|When Veronica discovers new {{evidence}} that suggests that Lilly's convicted killer is innocent, she decides to investigate the case. As Veronica delves deeper into the murder, she also works on other investigations, seeks her mother's whereabouts and deals with the aftermath of being drugged and raped during an 09er party. Veronica, no longer part of the school's wealthy in-crowd, makes some new friends: Wallace, Neptune High basketball star; Weevil, leader of the PCHers, <b>a</b> <b>Latino</b> biker gang; and Mac, Neptune High's resident computer genius. Using her friends' resources, {{as well as those}} provided by her father and his contacts, Veronica gains a reputation for sleuthing and finds her skills in increasingly high demand at her school. Things get more complicated when Veronica falls into a relationship with Lilly's ex-boyfriend Logan, who for a time held Veronica partly responsible for Lilly's death and {{went out of his way}} to harass her.|$|E
5|$|Cena won {{a number}} one contender's tournament {{for the right}} to face off against Lesnar for the WWE Championship at Backlash, but he failed to win the title at the event. After Backlash, Cena entered into a feud with Rhyno and Chris Benoit, which led to Cena, along with Chuck Palumbo and Johnny Stamboli, {{defeating}} the team of Spanky, Rhyno, and Benoit at Judgment Day. Shortly thereafter, Cena began mocking The Undertaker before and after his matches leading to a match between the two at Vengeance, where Cena lost a singles match against The Undertaker. In a rematch between the two, Cena would once again defeat The Undertaker on the August 5 episode of SmackDown!, this time with assistance from A-Train. The feud between Cena and Undertaker came to an end on the August 19 episode of SmackDown!, when Cena and A-Train defeated Undertaker and Orlando Jordan in a tag team match. Cena then pursued the United States Championship, but lost to then champion Eddie Guerrero in <b>a</b> <b>Latino</b> Street Fight for the title. After losing to Kurt Angle at No Mercy, Cena became a fan favorite (of which he's remained since) when he joined Angle as a member of his team at Survivor Series, where Cena and Chris Benoit were the survivors. Despite feuding, Cena and Benoit would later join forces as a makeshift tag team and on the November 27 episode of SmackDown! both won a 20-man battle royal to earn a WWE Championship match when, after being the last two men remaining, they would eliminate each other {{at the same time and}} were both declared joint winners of the match. However, Benoit defeated Cena the following week on SmackDown! to earn a WWE Championship match against Lesnar that same night.|$|E

25|$|Founded by American {{entrepreneurs}} Jeff Valdez and Bruce Barshop, Sí TV {{was established}} in 1997 as a production company to develop, produce and distribute original English-language entertainment aimed primarily at <b>a</b> <b>Latino</b> audience. In 1998, the company produced two half-hour bilingual programs – the talk show Cafe Ole with Giselle Fernandez and the comedy series Funny Is Funny – for the Spanish-language cable channel Galavisión. The two series, which dealt primarily with Latino culture in the United States, helped boost Galavisión's audience share on weekends in the 18–34 Latino demographic by 83%. When Sí TV and Galavisión parted ways in August of that year, Valdez sold the shows into national syndication in 52 markets, drawing solid ratings in New York City, Atlanta, Houston and San Antonio.|$|E
25|$|In January 1910 Griffith and Lee Dougherty {{with the}} rest of the Biograph acting company {{traveled}} to Los Angeles. While the purpose of the trip was to shoot Ramona in authentic locations, it was also to determine the suitability of the West Coast as a place for a permanent studio. The group set up a small facility at Washington Street and Grand Avenue (where the Los Angeles Convention Center now stands). After this, Griffith and his players decided to go a little further north to a small village they had heard about that was friendly and had beautiful floral scenery. They decided to travel there and fell in love with this little place called Hollywood. Biograph then made the first film ever in Hollywood called In Old California, <b>a</b> <b>Latino</b> melodrama about the early days of Mexico-owned California. Griffith and the Biograph troupe filmed other short movies at various locations, then traveled back to New York. After the East Coast film community heard about Hollywood, other companies began to migrate there. Biograph’s little film launched Hollywood as the future movie capital of the world. It opened a studio at Pico and Georgia streets in downtown Los Angeles in 1911, and sent a film crew to work there each year until 1916.|$|E

500|$|Before the 19th century, no scholar {{was allowed}} to study or edit the Codex Vaticanus, and {{scholars}} did not ascribe any value to it; {{in fact it was}} suspected to have been interpolated by the Latin textual tradition. John Mill wrote in his Prolegomena (1707): [...] "in Occidentalium gratiam <b>a</b> <b>Latino</b> scriba exaratum" [...] (written by a Latin scribe for the western world). He did not believe there was value to having a collation for the manuscript. Wettstein would have liked to know the readings of the codex, but not because he thought that they could have been of any help to him for difficult textual decisions. According to him, this codex had no authority whatsoever (sed ut vel hoc constaret, Codicem nullus esse auctoris). In 1751 Wettstein produced the first list of the New Testament manuscripts, Codex Vaticanus received symbol B (because of its age) and took second position on this list (Alexandrinus received A, Ephraemi – C, Bezae – D, etc.) until the discovery of Codex Sinaiticus (designated by ℵ).|$|E

500|$|The ad {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Slate {{called it}} the [...] "most striking Super Bowl ad" [...] but also criticized it for being similar in concept to a 2011 YouTube video by Farms.com. [...] While the Slate review was criticizing its originality, Farms.com released a statement reflecting their approval of the ad. [...] While liveblogging the Super Bowl commercials for the Wall Street Journal, Cindy Gallop {{referred to it as}} the [...] "Great American Super Bowl Commercial". [...] Dale Buss, of Forbes, wrote [...] "Chrysler managed to insert just enough of its vehicles and brands in each spot so as to make their inclusion seem {{part of the fabric of}} the paean, not at all intrusive, thereby lending the kind of authenticity to Ram and Jeep that fuels long-term brand success".

When Perlman said, 'I always wanted to play a Jewish man who wants to be an Italian gangster', and I asked why, and he said, 'because that's what I am – a Jewish boy from New York', well, that automatically cemented it for me." [...] Oscar Isaac portrays <b>a</b> <b>Latino</b> convict named Standard, who is married to Irene and is just released from prison a week after Irene meets The Driver. He found the role to be a bit unappealing and chose to turn the archetypal character into something more. He said of the role: As soon as I sat down with Nicolas, he explained this universe and world of the story, so we made the character into someone interested in owning a restaurant, someone who made some wrong decisions in his life, ending up in a bad place. By making 'Standard' more specific and more interesting, we found that it made the story that more compelling.|$|E

While some characters such as Geordi La Forge and Beverly Crusher remain recognizable from their descriptions in the initial casting call, others have clear differences; [...] "Julien Picard" [...] would lapse into a French accent when he became emotional, and Data was non-Caucasian. Macha Hernandez was <b>a</b> <b>Latino</b> security chief based on Jenette Goldstein's role in Aliens, while Deanna Troi was to appear [...] "foreign" [...] or more specifically of an Icelandic or Scandinavian nature. Leslie Crusher was listed as a fifteen-year-old girl with a photographic memory, although was quickly changed to a male teenager called Wesley. Justman argued for a female teenager but Roddenberry thought {{that there would be a}} greater number of storylines available if the character was male.|$|E
