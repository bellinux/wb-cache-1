40|$|Decreased insulin {{secretion}} has a {{great impact}} on the incidence of type 2 diabetes in Japanese subjects. It is not clear whether β-cell function is related to muscle mass in subjects without diabetes. We investigated the relationship between β-cell function and skeletal muscle mass in Japanese subjects without diabetes. The study included 1098 subjects (538 men and 560 women) aged 40 to 79 years, without diabetes (fasting glucose lower than 126 mg/dL and glycosylated hemoglobin lower than 6. 5 %), who consulted Osaka Medical College Health Science Clinic for a medical examination. Appendicular muscle mass was measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis. <b>Appendicular</b> muscle mass <b>index</b> was calculated as appendicular muscle mass divided by height squared (kg/m 2). The homeostatic model assessment of β-cell function was used to assess β-cell function. The homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance was used as a measure of insulin resistance. The association between <b>appendicular</b> muscle mass <b>index</b> and clinical parameters of β-cell function and insulin resistance was examined. Log-transformed homeostatic model assessment of β-cell function and Log-transformed homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance showed a normal distribution. In both men and women, there was a significant positive correlation between <b>appendicular</b> muscle mass <b>index</b> and clinical parameters of β-cell function and insulin resistance. Tertile analysis, following stratification <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>appendicular</b> muscle mass <b>index,</b> found that low <b>appendicular</b> muscle mass <b>index</b> was significantly associated with the Log homeostatic model assessment of β-cell function and Log-transformed homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance. This study shows that decreased β cell function is associated with reduced skeletal muscle mass in Japanese subjects without diabetes...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Vitamin D intake {{may prevent}} {{physical}} performance decline through prevention of muscle mass loss. Our {{objective was to}} determine whether low dietary intakes were associated with low muscle mass (MM). Design and participants: Cross-sectional analysis of 1989 community-dwelling women (mean age 80. 5 +/- 3. 8 years) from the EPIDemiologie de l 2 ̆ 7 OSteoporose (EPIDOS) study were assessed at baseline. Measurements: Low intakes of vitamin D (< 70 mu g/week) were estimated from the weekly dietary vitamin D intakes (self-administered food frequency questionnaire). Low MM was defined <b>according</b> <b>to</b> the <b>appendicular</b> skeletal muscle mass index assessed using Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry, divided by square height of less than 5. 45 kg/m(2). Usual gait speed defined physical performance. Age, sun exposure, co-morbidities, education level, living arrangements, recreational physical activity, dietary protein and calcium intakes, bone mineral density, handgrip strength, and body mass index were considered as potential confounders. Multivariate logistic regression analyses assessed the association between low vitamin D intakes and low MM. Results: Two-hundred and nine (10. 5...|$|R

Objective: To analyze {{the effects of}} global training on maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax), motor disability (MD), functional capacity (FC), gait speed (GS) of a chronic stroke survivor. Method: It was conducted a case study composed by muscle strengthening and aerobic exercises. PImax was measured pre-intervention, after three weeks, and post-intervention and the other outcomes were measured pre and post-intervention. The differences on FC, GS and PImax were described with their respective absolute and percentage values. MD was analyzed <b>according</b> <b>to</b> its minimal clinically important difference. Results/Conclusion: The participant presented considerable improvement on described outcomes, increasing 250 % his PImax and reaching minimal clinically important difference on MD measure, justifying new studies to test the efficacy of this intervention...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION Acute Appendicitis is the commonest {{abdominal}} surgical {{emergency in}} young adults {{all over the}} world. In early 1900 s, Ochsner in Chicago and Sherren at the London Hospital were both advocates of conservative treatment in late cases. Appendicular perforation is a serious complication {{in view of the}} ensuing peritonitis with the consequent sequelae and morbidity. AIM To study the incidence, morbidity and sequelae of appendicular perforation. MATERIALS & METHODS This is a prospective study done in our hospital where 110 cases of peritonitis due <b>to</b> <b>appendicular</b> perforation were selected for our study. All the cases where peritonitis was due <b>to</b> <b>appendicular</b> perforation at laparotomy were included. The study period was from January 2014 to December 2015. The cases of peritonitis due to other causes like duodenal, gastric, enteric perforation were excluded. Patients with acute abdominal emergency with clinical diagnosis of peritonitis were examined carefully with detailed history and clinical examination. Necessary investigations were done and patients taken up for emergency surgery. CONCLUSIONS Acute Appendicitis is the commonest abdominal surgical emergency in young adults all over the world. Age incidence of appendicular perforation is maximum in the age group of 21 – 30 years. Next common age group is 31 – 40 yrs. Incidence is more in males. Male to female ratio is 2. 4 : 1. Pain abdomen, vomiting, fever and anorexia were common symptoms in all the patients. Majority of the patients came late to the hospital accounting for the cause of perforation and subsequent mortality and morbidity...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Sarcopenia {{has been}} {{associated}} with increased morbidity and mortality in older people. However, there is still no consensus about the best diagnostic criteria for it. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate different diagnostic criteria of sarcopenia and their relationship with muscle strength and functional capacity. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in Santa Maria-RS, Brazil. Body composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Physical performance was evaluated by the Timed-get-up-and-go test (TGUG). Muscle strength was measured with a handgrip dynamometer. The proposed criteria of sarcopenia were evaluated as follows: A) <b>appendicular</b> lean mass <b>index</b> (aLM/ht 2), cutoffs 5. 5 kg/m 2, 2 SD, 10 th percentile, and 20 th percentile of young reference; B) a linear regression model was used <b>to</b> adjust <b>appendicular</b> lean mass (aLM) for both height and fat mass, cutoff 20 th percentile of elderly. RESULTS: In total, 104 women {{agreed to participate in the}} research, 39 young (20 to 40 years) and 65 elderly (over 60 years). The prevalence of sarcopenia varied from 0 % to 17. 2 % <b>according</b> <b>to</b> the diagnostic criteria. Regarding muscle strength, the aLM/ht 2 cutoff 10 th percentile was the criterion with greater area under the ROC curve. However, there were no criteria with an area under the ROC curve greater than 0. 5 when TGUG was the outcome. The reclassification showed that the criterion B reclassified 66. 7 % with normal grip strength as sarcopenic. CONCLUSION: Of these criteria, aLM/ht 2 cutoff 10 th percentile had stronger correlation with muscle strength...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} case of {{squamous}} cell lung cancer with metastases to cuboid bone. The 99 m Tc-MDP whole body bone scintigraphy of the patient showed an area of increased tracer uptake at the cuboid bone of his right foot. Because of the rare occurrence of bone metastases <b>to</b> <b>appendicular</b> skeleton, the diagnosis of bone metastasis for this patient was not concluded from this bone scan. Subsequent MRI examination found a tumor mass in the same area. The patient then received wide tumor excision and the metastatic squamous cell carcinoma was confirmed from pathological findings. This case suggests that for malignant patients with anomalous appendicular uptake from bone scan, the possibility of bone metastasis should not be overlooked and further studies such as plain radiography, MRI or biopsy should be arranged.
