40|$|Cellular {{mechanisms}} contributing <b>to</b> <b>renewal</b> of terminal bronchioles remain poorly defined. Our {{previous studies}} identified pollutant-resistant Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP) -expressing stem cells that localize to the neuroepithelial body (NEB) and contribute <b>to</b> <b>renewal</b> of the proximal bronchiolar epithelium. However, activation of NEB-associated stem cells is unlikely <b>to</b> contribute <b>to</b> <b>renewal</b> of {{terminal bronchiolar epithelium}} because of the paucity of NEBs at this location. Goals {{of this study were}} to determine the location and properties of cells contributing <b>to</b> <b>renewal</b> of terminal bronchioles after Clara cell depletion. Pollutant-resistant CCSP-expressing cells were identified that localized to the bronchoalveolar duct junction (BADJ) and contribute to restoration of a phenotypically diverse epithelium. CCSP-expressing cells comprise the predominant proliferative population in initial terminal bronchiolar repair and include a population of label-retaining cells suggesting that they maintain characteristics of a stem cell population. Furthermore, immunohistochemical co-localization studies involving CCSP and the NEB-specific marker calcitonin gene-related peptide indicate that BADJ-associated CCSP-expressing stem cells function independently of NEB microenvironments. These studies identify a BADJ-associated, NEB-independent, CCSP-expressing stem cell population in terminal bronchioles and support the notion that regiospecific stem cell niches function to maintain epithelial diversity after injury...|$|R

Theoretical models developed specifically for competing acorn barnacles {{predict that the}} proportional <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> male function increases toward an asymptote of 50 % {{as the number of}} competitors for fertilizations increases. Experimental manipulations were used to investigate how mate competition affected both relative and absolute <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> the sex functions for two species of acorn barnacle: Semibalanus balanoides and Balanus glandula. The ratio of male <b>to</b> female <b>allocation</b> did not increase with the number of competitors for either species. However, both species showed increased <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> male function (estimated as total mass of sex-specific tissues) with increased crowding. <b>Allocation</b> <b>to</b> female function seemed to be limited by other factors and did not vary with mating group size as predicted. <b>Allocation</b> <b>to</b> male and female function were both positively related to body size, but a trade-off between male and female function, a key assumption of prior models, was not observed...|$|R

40|$|In resource-poor environments, {{adjustment}} in plant biomass allocation implies a complex interplay between environmental signals and plant development {{rather than a}} delay in plant development alone. To understand how environmental factors influence biomass allocation or the developing phenotype, {{it is necessary to}} distinguish the biomass allocations resulting from environmental gradients or ontogenetic drift. Here, we compared the development trajectories of cotton plants (Gossypium herbaceum L.), which were grown in two contrasting soil textures during a 60 -d period. Those results distinguished the biomass allocation pattern resulting from ontogenetic drift and the response to soil texture. The soil texture significantly changed the biomass <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> leaves and roots, but not to stems. Soil texture also significantly changed the development trajectories of leaf and root traits, but did not change the scaling relationship between basal stem diameter and plant height. Results of nested ANOVAs of consecutive plant-size categories in both soil textures showed that soil gradients explained an average of 63. 64 - 70. 49 % of the variation of biomass <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> leaves and roots. Ontogenetic drift explained 77. 47 % of the variation in biomass <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> stems. The results suggested that the environmental factors governed the biomass <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> roots and leaves, and ontogenetic drift governed the biomass <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> stems. The results demonstrated that biomass <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> metabolically active organs (e. g., roots and leaves) was mainly governed by environmental factors, and that biomass <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> metabolically non-active organs (e. g., stems) was mainly governed by ontogenetic drift. We concluded that differentiating the causes of development trajectories of plant traits was important to the understanding of plant response to environmental gradients...|$|R
