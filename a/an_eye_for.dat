5|$|The aim of some later novels {{has been}} to {{concentrate}} as much on local colour as on the story. This was true of William Percival Crozier's historical romance The Fates Are Laughing (1945), set during the fall of Sejanus and the reign of Caligula, written by a classicist with <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> detail.|$|E
5|$|A {{creative}} {{player on}} the ball, with excellent vision, technical skills, and <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> goal, he is a free kick specialist and is capable of playing in several offensive positions. Due to his short stature, dynamic abilities and pace, Giovinco acquired the nickname formica atomica ("atomic ant", after the eponymous Hanna-Barbera character) in his youth. In 2015, he was {{named one of the}} 100 best footballers in the world by The Guardian, FourFourTwo, and L'Équipe.|$|E
5|$|A delegation, {{consisting}} of {{the representatives of the}} twelve important clans of Medina, invited Muhammad to serve as chief arbitrator for the entire community; due to his status as a neutral outsider. There was fighting in Yathrib: primarily the dispute involved its Arab and Jewish inhabitants, and was estimated to have lasted for around a hundred years before 620. The recurring slaughters and disagreements over the resulting claims, especially after the Battle of Bu'ath in which all clans were involved, made it obvious to them that the tribal concept of blood-feud and <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> an eye were no longer workable unless there was one man with authority to adjudicate in disputed cases. The delegation from Medina pledged themselves and their fellow-citizens to accept Muhammad into their community and physically protect him as one of themselves.|$|E

5|$|In {{her efforts}} {{to be the perfect}} wife, she was often given <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> trying too hard, but at the same time, she became a subject of envy for fellow politicians' wives. Imelda learned how to get people's {{attention}} and to focus it on both her and her husband. She reached out to every single person who was seen as essential in Marcos's campaign. Her efforts were not original, but extraordinary. No other politicians' wives shook hands with all the delegates, visited their homes, genuinely understood the concerns they had, aside from Imelda. She bombarded them with gifts when necessary.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} fearless in defence of its nest and young, and, like other Strix owls, strikes for the intruder's head with its sharp talons. Because its flight is silent, {{it may not}} be {{detected}} until it is too late to avoid the danger. Dogs, cats and humans may be assaulted, sometimes without provocation. Perhaps the best-known victim of the tawny owl's fierce attack was the renowned bird photographer Eric Hosking, who lost his left eye when struck by a bird he was attempting to photograph near its nest in 1937. He later called his autobiography <b>An</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>for</b> a Bird.|$|E
5|$|To his supporters, Quisling was {{regarded}} as a conscientious administrator of the highest order, knowledgeable and with <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> detail. Balanced and gentle to a fault, they believed he cared deeply about his people and maintained high moral standards throughout. To his opponents, Quisling was unstable and undisciplined, abrupt, even threatening. Quite possibly he was both, at ease among friends and under pressure when confronted with his political opponents, and generally shy and retiring with both. During formal dinners he often said nothing at all except for the occasional cascade of dramatic rhetoric. Indeed, he did not react well to pressure and would often let slip over-dramatic sentiments when put on the spot. Normally open to criticism, he was prone to assuming larger groups were conspiratorial.|$|E

5|$|This artistic {{period is}} one of {{discovery}} of the expressive possibilities of the human body; {{there is a greater}} freedom in the poses and gestures, and an increased attention to anatomical verisimilitude, as may be observed in the ponderated stances of figures W9 and W4, who partially anticipate the Doryphoros of Polykleitos. There is a noticeable ease to the physiques of the frieze compared with the stiffness of the metopes along with <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> such subtleties as knuckle joints, veins, and the careful articulation of musculature. One important innovation of the style is the use of drapery as an expression of motion, or to suggest the body beneath; in archaic and early classical sculpture, clothing fell over the body {{as if it were a}} curtain obscuring the form below, in theses sculptures there is the billowing chlamydes of the horsemen and the multi-pleated peploi of the women that lends a surface movement and tension to their otherwise, static poses. Variation in the manes of the horses has been of particular interest to some scholars attempting to discern the artistic personalities of sculptors who laboured on the frieze or perhaps, indicating deliberate representation of different regional traditions, so far this Morellian analysis has been without conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Agile, quick, creative, and powerful, Balotelli is {{credited}} with pace, flair, physical strength, technical ability, and <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> goal; his height, elevation and physique allow him to excel in the air, and {{he is capable of}} scoring with his head or with either foot, from both inside or outside the area. Although he normally plays in a central role as a main striker, he is a versatile forward, who is capable of playing anywhere along the front line, and has also been deployed as a winger or as a second striker. Despite his talent, however, he has been criticized by managers, teammates, and the media for a perceived poor and immature attitude at times, as well as his for his poor movement and work-rate, inconsistency, mentality, and volatile temperament and arrogant behaviour on the pitch, which has often led him to pick up unnecessary bookings throughout his career. Balotelli has also been accused of diving, and is thus regarded by teammates and the media as a promising but undisciplined player. Due to his powerful shot, Balotelli is also a set-piece specialist, and is {{regarded as one of the}} best penalty kick takers in world football, a view backed by his former Manchester City goalkeeping teammate Joe Hart. Balotelli missed his first competitive penalty against Napoli on 22 September 2013 when it was saved by Pepe Reina; the first time in 22 attempts as a professional.|$|E

25|$|The {{works of}} Martial became highly valued on their {{discovery}} by the Renaissance, whose writers often {{saw them as}} sharing <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> the urban vices of their own times. The poet's influence is seen in Juvenal, late classical literature, the Carolingian revival, the Renaissance in France and Italy, the Siglo de Oro, and early modern English and German poetry, until {{with the growth of}} the Romantic movement he became unfashionable.|$|E

It not only took Colburn, then not 20, deeper into the world of publishing, but also earned him wider respect amongst railroad men across America – locomotive builders and train operators.|$|E
