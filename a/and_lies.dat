40|$|We study dualities between <b>Lie</b> algebras <b>and</b> <b>Lie</b> coalgebras, <b>and</b> their {{respective}} (co) representations. To allow {{a study of}} dualities in an infinite-dimensional setting, we introduce the notions of <b>Lie</b> monads <b>and</b> <b>Lie</b> comonads, as special cases of YB-Lie algebras and YB-Lie coalgebras in additive monoidal categories. We show that (strong) dualities between <b>Lie</b> algebras <b>and</b> <b>Lie</b> coalgebras {{are closely related to}} (iso) morphisms between associated <b>Lie</b> monads <b>and</b> <b>Lie</b> comonads. In the case of a duality between two Hopf algebras - in the sense of Takeuchi - we recover a duality between a <b>Lie</b> algebra <b>and</b> a <b>Lie</b> coalgebra - in the sense defined in this note - by computing the primitive and the indecomposable elements, respectively. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.
