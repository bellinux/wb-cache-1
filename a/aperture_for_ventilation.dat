50|$|Responding {{to the new}} requirements, a magazine, Plumbing and Sanitation Engineer, held a {{tenement}} {{design contest}} in 1879. James Ware's winning dumbbell design represented a compromise between legal health standards and commercial viability. By indenting {{the sides of the}} structure three feet, he opened a slender airshaft between abutting buildings. The three-foot indentation required only a minimal sacrifice of rent-revenue space, placating the landlords, and provided just enough <b>aperture</b> <b>for</b> <b>ventilation</b> and natural, if not direct, light.|$|E
