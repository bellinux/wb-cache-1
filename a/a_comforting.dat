5|$|Gibanica {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{recognizable}} pastry dishes from the Balkans, whether served on festive occasions, or as <b>a</b> <b>comforting</b> family snack. In Serbia, the dish is often consumed at traditional events such as Christmas, Easter and Slava. According to the Serbian media, the largest Gibanica ever made was in the town of Mionica in 2007. It weighed over 1,000 kg, and was applied for inclusion in the Guinness Book of Records. 330kg of phyllo dough, 330kg of cheese, 3,300 eggs, 30 l. of oil, 110 l. of mineral water, 50kg of lard and 500 packets of baking powder went into its creation. In Serbia, as well as in neighboring countries, there are festivals dedicated to pies. One of them, called the Gibanica festival or Days of Banitsa, is held each year in Bela Palanka. It first took place in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Gabbar Singh, the film's antagonist, {{was well}} {{received}} by the audience, despite his pervasive sadistic cruelty. Dissanayake explains that the audience {{was fascinated by the}} dialogues and mannerisms of the character, and this element of spectacle outweighed his actions, a first for Indian melodrama. He notes that the picturisation of violence in the film was glamourised and uninhibited. He further notes that, unlike earlier melodramas in which the female body occupies the audience's attention as an object of male fetish, in Sholay, the male body becomes the centrepiece. It becomes the battleground where good and evil compete for supremacy. Dissanayake argues that Sholay {{can be viewed as a}} national allegory: it lacks <b>a</b> <b>comforting</b> logical narrative, it shows social stability being repeatedly challenged, and it shows the devaluation of human life resulting from a lack of emotions. Taken together, these elements comprise the allegorical representation of India. The narrative style of Sholay, with its violence, revenge, and vigilante action, is occasionally compared by scholars to the political unrest in India at the time of its release. This tension culminated in the Emergency (rule by decree) declared by prime minister Indira Gandhi in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Sophie {{was one of}} Mozart 's pups seen on Meerkat Manor. She had two {{brothers}} and one sister named Sparkle. Only one of her brothers was given a name and he was called Spud. They were born some time after Tosca, Mozart's sister, gave birth to three pups. Their uncle Yossarian decided to move their pups who {{were only a few}} days old. He brought each up above ground and started to move them to a new burrow. The babysitters followed him and carried each pup. The Whiskers returned and Yossarian dropped the pup he was carrying, who was Sophie's sister. Her sister got left behind and died later that night. The other pups were moved to the new burrow. One day, while being babysat by Yossarian, Mitch, Sophie's other uncle, viciously attacked her without warning. Yossarian failed to stop the assault and simply waited until Mitch was proud of the beating. Afterwards, little Sophie {{was in a state of}} shock, but thankfully Tosca gave Sophie <b>a</b> <b>comforting</b> cuddle. Sophie didn't re-appear in the series until much later, when she was older. She was seen babysitting a litter, but was finding them a bit of a handful. That was the last time Sophie was mentioned in Season 1. In this season and up until season 3, she was played by Tina Sparkle since the real Sophie was the one Youssarian unintentionally killed.|$|E

40|$|Background: Many {{people with}} {{dementia}} die in long-term care settings. These patients {{may benefit from}} a palliative care goal, focused on comfort. Admission {{may be a good}} time to revisit or develop care plans. Objective: To describe care goals in nursing home patients with dementia and factors associated with establishing <b>a</b> <b>comfort</b> care goal. Design: We used generalized estimating equation regression analyses for baseline analyses and multinomial logistic regression analyses for longitudinal analyses. Setting: Prospective data collection in 28 Dutch facilities, mostly nursing homes (2007 - 2010; Dutch End of Life in Dementia study, DEOLD). Results: Eight weeks after admission (baseline), 56. 7 % of 326 patients had <b>a</b> <b>comfort</b> care goal. At death, 89. 5 % had <b>a</b> <b>comfort</b> care goal. Adjusted for illness severity, patients with <b>a</b> baseline <b>comfort</b> care goal were more likely to have a religious affiliation, to be less competent to make decisions, and to have a short survival prediction. Their families were less likely to prefer life-prolongation and more likely to be satisfied with family-physician communication. Compared with patients with <b>a</b> <b>comfort</b> care goal established later during their stay, patients with <b>a</b> baseline <b>comfort</b> care goal also more frequently had a more highly educated family member. Conclusions: Initially, over half of the patients had a care goal focused on comfort, increasing to the large majority of the patients at death. Optimizing patient-family-physician communication upon admission may support the early establishing of <b>a</b> <b>comfort</b> care goal. Patient condition and family views play a role, and physicians should be aware that religious affiliation and education may also affect the (timing of) setting <b>a</b> <b>comfort</b> care goal...|$|R

500|$|... "Mutual Core" [...] is an uptempo {{experimental}} song, which displays {{elements from}} electro, techno, glitch, breakcore and ambient, and includes also a choral part during the chorus. The {{rhythm of the}} song can be roughly divided into two distinct parts: the verses, which feature moderately sparse electronic beats and a time signature of 5/4, and the choruses, which display more upbeat sounds and a 2/4 time signature.

She was President Theodore Roosevelt's sister and the aunt to whom many of the young people in the family went for advice. I had asked her whether I should do something which at that time would have caused a great deal of criticism, and her answer was: 'Do not be bothered by what people say as long as you are sure that you are doing what seems right to you, but be sure that you face yourself honestly.'"

500|$|Sos most {{prominent}} political statement, [...] "Don't Give Up", was fuelled by Gabriel's discontent with rising unemployment during Margaret Thatcher's premiership and Dorothea Lange's photograph [...] "Migrant Mother". The track {{began as a}} rhythm pattern of slow, low-pitched tom-tom drums that Gabriel made, and Lanois believed could serve as the centrepiece of a song. Tony Levin added bass {{to create a more}} harmonious sound, and {{during the second half of}} the track, put a nappy behind his bass strings to dampen the sound. Gabriel ensured the song, which follows a narrative of an unemployed man and his lover, was written as a conversational piece. He initially sought out Dolly Parton to portray the woman, although Parton declined; his friend Kate Bush later agreed to feature. Bush serves as the song's respondent, she assumes <b>a</b> <b>comforting</b> role and with delicate vocals, sings lines such as [...] "Rest your head/ you worry too much". The album's first side culminates with [...] "That Voice Again", in which Gabriel explores the concept of conscience, examining the [...] "parental voice in our heads that either helps or defeats us". Co-written with David Rhodes, who plays guitar over Katché and Levin's input, the song was written after Gabriel's initial discussions with Martin Scorsese about scoring The Last Temptation of Christ (1988).|$|E

500|$|Some of {{the most}} vocal critics of end-time {{conspiracy}} theories come from within Christianity. In 1993, historian Bruce Barron wrote a stern rebuke of apocalyptic Christian conspiracism in the Christian Research Journal, when reviewing Robertson's 1991 book The New World Order. Another critique {{can be found in}} historian Gregory S. Camp's 1997 book Selling Fear: Conspiracy Theories and End-Times Paranoia. Religious studies scholar Richard T. Hughes argues that [...] "New World Order" [...] rhetoric libels the Christian faith, since the [...] "New World Order" [...] as defined by Christian conspiracy theorists has no basis in the Bible whatsoever. [...] Furthermore, he argues that not only is this idea unbiblical, it is positively anti-biblical and fundamentally anti-Christian, because by misinterpreting key passages in the Book of Revelation, it turns <b>a</b> <b>comforting</b> message about the coming kingdom of God into one of fear, panic and despair {{in the face of an}} allegedly approaching one-world government. Progressive Christians, such as preacher-theologian Peter J. Gomes, caution Christian fundamentalists that a [...] "spirit of fear" [...] can distort scripture and history through dangerously combining biblical literalism, apocalyptic timetables, demonization and oppressive prejudices, while Camp warns of the [...] "very real danger that Christians could pick up some extra spiritual baggage" [...] by credulously embracing conspiracy theories. They therefore call on Christians who indulge in conspiracism to repent.|$|E
500|$|The {{characters}} {{introduced in}} XIII-2 received a mixed reception, with some praising their inclusion and others {{saying they were}} too weak. Ryan Clements felt that the characters {{seemed to have no}} clear focus, with the only driving force being the quest for Lightning. VanOrd thought the characters were good, but said that the game focused too much on Serah and Noel, rather than the more engaging characters of Lightning and Caius. Dale North of Destructoid was the most positive, finding the characters very well fleshed out, understandable and well-voiced by the cast. den Ouden thought that the characters alright and well voiced, but [...] " [...] flat when the actors [...] awkward dialogue to work with". Juba was extremely critical of the characters and their story, seeing the company taking the [...] "weakest" [...] characters and placing them center stage, while the [...] "best" [...] characters, such as Lighting and Fang, were relegated to the background. Parish was disappointed in the character's development, saying that Serah was never given any true power within the game's narrative, and that Noel was under-developed beyond his original premise, with the [...] "stronger" [...] characters from the original game being a noticeable loss. On top of this, he disliked how the two [...] "least liked" [...] characters from XIII (Serah and Hope) were given such large roles. Parkin was especially critical, saying the characters were [...] "irritating or forgettable, full of fuzzy or weak motivations and stuffed with tortuous, posturing dialogue". Despite this, he said that Serah's warmth endowed the game with <b>a</b> <b>comforting</b> atmosphere.|$|E

40|$|Background: Many {{people with}} {{dementia}} {{die in a}} nursing home. <b>A</b> <b>comfort</b> care goal may be beneficial. Little research has {{examined the relationship between}} care goals and outcome. Aim: To investigate whether family satisfaction with end-of-life care and quality of dying is associated with whether or not dementia patients have <b>a</b> <b>comfort</b> goal shortly after admission. Design and setting: Prospective data collection from 28 long-term care facilities (the Dutch End of Life in Dementia study). We included 148 patients who died after prospective follow-up. Main outcomes were family satisfaction (End-of-Life in Dementia- Satisfaction with Care scale; range: 10 - 40) and quality of dying (End-of-Life in Dementia-Comfort Assessment in Dying; range: 14 - 42). We performed generalized estimating equations regression analyses to analyze whether these outcomes are associated with <b>a</b> <b>comfort</b> goal established shortly after admission compared with another or no care goal as reported by the physician. Results: Families of patients were more satisfied with end-of-life care when <b>a</b> <b>comfort</b> goal was established shortly after admission. We found this pattern only for patients who died within 6 months of admission (adjusted b: 4. 5; confidence interval: 2. 8, 6. 3 vs - 1. 2; confidence interval: - 3. 0, 0. 6 for longer stay). For quality of dying, no such association was found. Conclusion: We found that family satisfaction with care is related to <b>a</b> <b>comfort</b> care goal shortly after admission, but quality of dying did not. Establishing <b>a</b> <b>comfort</b> goal at <b>an</b> early stage may be important to the family. Advance care planning interventions should be studied for their effects on patient and family outcome...|$|R
