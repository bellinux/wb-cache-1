40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} is to study {{the changes in the}} characteristics of an <b>austenitic</b> <b>sheet</b> material X 5 CrNi 18 - 10 (1. 4301, AISI 304) after a plastic deformation. Samples are cut out from the sheet material at three different directions - 0 °, 45 ° and 90 ° angle to the rolling direction. The changes in the mechanical properties and microstructure of the anisotropic austenitic steel are investigated by mechanical tests (uniaxial tension tests and hardness measurements) and structural analyses (optical and scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction). It is established that the strain induced phase transformation of the metastable austenite to martensite during the tension tests changes the magnetic properties of the steel. It is found out that the sheet anisotropy effect on the uniform deformation, the thickness reduction and structure of the austenite sheet material is more essential for the plastic deformation behaviour than the strain-induced γ → α′ phase transformation...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{advanced}} high manganese <b>austenitic</b> steel <b>sheets</b> were welded by {{resistance spot}} welding at different welding parameters. The effects of welding current, clamping force, number of the current impulse, and duration of each current impulse were examined. Based on Taguchi's method, an L- 27 (313) orthogonal array was employed for carrying out {{resistance spot welding}} tests. The welded sheets were subjected to tensile-shear tests {{in order to determine}} the strength of the welded joints. Basically, the results showed that tensile-shear strength increase with clamping force at the medium and high effective welding time (> 400 ms). However, the occurrence of micro cracks within the welded joints may justify the scattering of tensile-shear strength value...|$|R

40|$|Beside its {{conventional}} {{applications such}} as improving the wear resistance of machine parts and tools, plasma thermochemical treatment (PTT) can be successfully used as a method for surface modification to achieve specific surface properties. Surface electrical conductivity of <b>austenitic</b> stainless steel <b>sheets,</b> for example, can be significantly enhanced by means of plasma nitriding. Such materials are of interest for the use as bipolar plates of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). In this regard a new PTT method based on a strip hollow cathode (SHC-PTT) has been developed as a cost-effective process for surface modification of thin metal strips in continuous operation. A laboratory-scale SHC-PTT device operating in stationary treatment mode has been realized and short-time plasma nitriding of EN 1. 4301 (AISI 304) <b>austenitic</b> stainless steel <b>sheets</b> has been studied. The obtained nitrided layers were investigated using GDOES and XRD. Further, the interfacial contact resistance of the sheets was measured and the corrosion behaviour was investigated by means of electrochemical methods.

40|$|AI SI 304 L and 316 L <b>austenitic</b> {{stainless}} steel <b>sheets</b> were deformed at different strain and strain path using LDH (limiting dome height) method. Deformed microstructures had two interesting features- deformation twins and strain induced martensite. The former originated from decay of prior annealing twins {{as well as}} through formation of new deformation twins. Strain induced martensite formation was strongly affected by the strain and strain path. This was generalized in terms of frequency and size advantage - a classification based purely on martensite grain size. The frequency advantage was related to the presence of microstructural heterogeneities, while the growth advantage appears to originate from relative tolerance around 45 degrees Bain orientation relationship...|$|R
40|$|<b>Austenitic</b> {{stainless}} steel <b>sheets</b> have gathered wide acceptance in the fabrication of components, which require high temperature resistance and corrosion resistance, such as metal bellows used in expansion joints in aircraft, aerospace and petroleum industry. In case of single pass welding of thinner sections of this alloy, Pulsed Current Micro Plasma Arc Welding (PCMPAW) was found beneficial {{due to its}} advantages over the conventional continuous current process. This paper highlights the development of empirical mathematical equations using multiple regression analysis, correlating various process parameters to pitting corrosion rates in PCMPAW of AISI 304 L sheets in 1 Normal HCl.

40|$|A {{series of}} tests on cold-formed {{stainless}} steel square and rectangular hollow sections subjected to major axis bending is presented in this paper. The tests were performed on sections fabricated by cold-rolling from normal strength material of austenitic stainless steel type 304, and high strength material of duplex and high strength <b>austenitic</b> steel <b>sheets.</b> Tensile coupon tests were conducted to obtain the material properties of the test specimens. The test strengths were compared with the design strengths obtained using the American Specification and Australian/New Zealand Standard for stainless steel structures. The North American Specification for cold-formed carbon steel structural members was also used to predict and compare the bending strengths. In addition, the test strengths were compared with the theoretical elastic and plastic bending moments. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by the three specifications and the theoretical bending moments are generally conservative for the tested specimens. The reliability analysis was performed to evaluate {{the reliability of the}} design rules based on the existing resistance factors and load combination specified in the aforementioned specifications. It is shown that the American Specification and North American Specification are reliable for both normal and high strength specimens. The Australian/New Zealand Standard is reliable for normal strength specimens, but slightly unreliable for high strength specimens. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

At the initial sliding abrasive scratching by protruding carbide phases were the initial wear mechanism. Further sliding led to growth of sheet material transfer with formation of lump covering of the tool surfaces both carbide phase and metal matrix.

In this present investigation AISI 904 L solid wire having 1. 2 mm diameter {{was used as an}} electrode with direct current electrode positive polarity. Argon was employed for shielding purposes. The fusion zone is generally characterized by a few geometrical features namely bead width, bead height and depth of penetration. The shape of the fusion zone depends upon a number of parameters such as gas flow rate, voltage, travel speed and wire feed rate. Taguchi Technique is applied to plan the experiments.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a test program on cold-formed stainless steel tubular sections subjected to combined bending and web crippling. A {{series of tests}} was performed on square and rectangular hollow sections fabricated by cold-rolling from high strength material of duplex and high strength <b>austenitic</b> stainless steel <b>sheets.</b> The concentrated load was applied {{by means of a}} bearing plate which acted across the full flange width of the section. The flanges of the hollow section specimens were not fastened to the bearing plates during testing. The specimens were tested using the interior-one-flange loading condition specified in the American Specification and Australian/New Zealand Standard (AS/NZS) for cold-formed stainless steel structures. Different specimen lengths were tested to obtain the interaction relationship between moment and concentrated load. The combined bending and web crippling test results were compared with the design strengths obtained using the current American Specification and AS/NZS for cold-formed stainless steel structures.

40|$|The present work {{is devoted}} to the {{short-time}} plasma nitriding of EN 1. 4301 (AISI 304) <b>austenitic</b> stainless steel <b>sheets</b> in a pulsed glow discharge by means of a novel strip hollow cathode process for plasma thermochemical treatment (SHC-PTT) aiming at their use as bipolar plates of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). The fundamental trends in the change of the interfacial contact resistance (ICR) and corrosion resistance in dependence on the duration of plasma nitriding were studied. The investigations were focused on the capability of the method to reduce the ICR without deterioration of the corrosion resistance in a high-rate process. Within the range of experiments it could be shown that at a certain temperature, defined by improved or at least non-deteriorated corrosion resistance, the plasma nitriding rate is determined by the requested value of ICR. The simultaneously reduced ICR and improved corrosion resistance are explained by the formation of chromium nitrides on the substrate surfaces during the plasma nitriding. Acceptable ICR and corrosion resistance could be achieved in a continuous non-isothermal plasma nitriding process at a simulated strip rate up to 23 m h - 1 with further potential to speed up the process...|$|R
40|$|The Ni-based {{coatings}} {{with different}} content of spherical tungsten carbide were deposited by plasma transfer arc welding (PTAW) method on 304 <b>austenitic</b> stainless steel <b>sheets</b> in this study. The microstructure and wear property of spherical tungsten carbide particle reinforced composite coatings were investigated {{by means of}} optical microscope, scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and sliding wear test. It is shown that the fraction of spherical tungsten carbides has an important influence on microstructure of Ni-based overlay. The Ni 40 overlay consists of γ-Ni dendrites with interdendritic Ni-based eutectics, borides and carbides improving the wear resistance. In the case of composite coatings with different content of tungsten carbide, many new phases are observed, such as Ni 2 W 4 C and NiW. In addition, there are {{a large number of}} irregular structures in composite coatings, such as acicular structure and irregular stripe organization. The results of sliding wear test indicate that the mass loss of coatings is influenced by the content of tungsten carbide. The mass loss decreases with the increase of tungsten carbide fraction. At high load, the abrasive resistance of composite coating with 60 wt. % tungsten carbide is improved about 50 -fold compared to that of Ni 40 overlay...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} {{deformation}} induced martensite on the HCF and VHCF properties of <b>austenitic</b> stainless steel <b>sheets</b> in different conditions was studied. In the undeformed condition true VHCF fatigue limit exists even though microplasticity (slip markings) could already {{be found at}} a stress amplitude of {{less than a third}} of the VHCF fatigue limit and global plastic behavior at less than a half of the VHCF fatigue limit. Fatigue tests with monotonically predeformed specimens in one direction containing different martensite volume fractions showed that the martensite content enhances the HCF and VHCF properties and the fatigue limit remains independent of the cycle number up to 27  vol-%. At 54  vol-% martensite the more brittle behavior and the high notch sensitivity of the martensite phase becomes predominant. This leads to crack initiation at inclusions and a fatigue limit decreasing with the number of cycles in the VHCF regime. By comparing these tests with the behavior of specimens that were monotonically predeformed in two directions, it could be concluded that the VHCF properties are not determined predominantly by the dislocation density, direction of predeformation or amount of predeformation, but by the martensite content, notch sensitivity and the purity of the material. The results lead to the recommendation that automotive stainless steel structures undergoing cyclic loads beyond 2 ⋅ 106 cycles should not exceed a deformation-induced martensite content of 27  vol-%...|$|R
40|$|Micro-TIG welding {{experiments}} {{have been used}} for the welding of the contacts of special lamps. Since the welded materials were different, the welded joint was a heterogeneous bound. For the joints a 0. 6 mm Ni-Mn alloy or 0. 4 mm Mo wire were inserted onto the hole of AISI 304 type <b>austenitic</b> stainless steel <b>sheet,</b> with a wall thickness of 0. 35 mm. The micro-TIG welding was completed with a welding machine of which control characteristics corresponded to all the requirements necessary for TIG arc-spot welding. The goal of the experiments was to find the optimum regarding the quality of the lamps’ welded joints that correspond with the needed production quality level. The problems that occurred throughout the welding process were due to the very high melting point of the Mo. Also, using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy have performed a proper testing in parallel with the experiments. The details, revealed that the geometry of the joint and the resistance depend very much of the arc length, shielding gas velocity and especially of the tip geometry of the tungsten electrode and its wearing. Regarding to the electrode’s wearing, there have been determined the tip angle, the tapering and the effect of the electrode’s material composition. The latter parameter was investigated for unalloyed, thorium-oxide, cerium-oxide and lanthanum- oxide alloyed electrodes...|$|R
40|$|The {{utilization}} of {{aluminum die casting}} as enclosures where internal equipment is rotating inside of the casting and could fracture requires a strong housing to restrain the fractured parts. A typical example would be a supercharger. In case of a failure, unless adequately contained, fractured parts could injure people operating the equipment. A number of potential reinforcement materials were investigated. The initial work was conducted in sand molds to create experimental conditions that promote prolonged contact of the reinforcing material with molten aluminum. Bonding of Aluminum bronze, Cast iron, and Ni-resist inserts with various electroplated coatings and surface treatments were analyzed. Also toughening of A 354 aluminum cast alloy by steel and stainless steel wire mesh with various conditions was analyzed. A practical approach to reinforcement of die cast aluminum components {{is to use a}} reinforcing steel preform. Such performs can be fabricated from steel wire mesh or perforated metal sheet by stamping or deep drawing. A hemispherical, dome shaped casting was selected in this investigation. A deep drawing die was used to fabricate the reinforcing performs. The tendency of aluminum cast enclosures to fracture could be significantly reduced by installing a wire mesh of austenitic stainless steel or a punched <b>austenitic</b> stainless steel <b>sheet</b> within the casting. The use of reinforcements made of austenitic stainless steel wire mesh or punched <b>austenitic</b> stainless steel <b>sheet</b> provided marked improvement in reducing the fragmentation of the casting. The best strengthening was obtained with austenitic stainless steel wire and with a punched stainless steel sheet without annealing this material. Somewhat lower results were obtained with the annealed punched stainless steel sheet. When the annealed 1020 steel wire mesh was used, the results were only slightly improved because of the lower mechanical properties of this unalloyed steel. The lowest results were obtained with unreinforced 356 aluminum casting. Good strength can be obtained with a sound die casting without any defects produced by squeeze casting. The use of higher pressure to produce the squeeze casting has been shown to increase the strength of a hemispherical dome casting. This dome shape casting has been produced both with and without reinforcement and tested to determine its pressure resistance under internal pressure of water. Only a slight improvement in strength could be determined because of water leaks at the seal between hemispherical dome and its flat supporting side. However, when the ability of the casting was tested under the compressive force of a plunger, the strengthening effect of wire mesh or sheet was evident. Higher loads to failure were obtained because of the reinforcement of the stainless steel wire and punched sheet. Rather than a sudden failure occurring, the reinforcement of the stainless steel wire or the punched hard stainless steel sheet held the material together and prevented any loss of the fractured casting to the surroundings. Unalloyed steel did not have the required strength or mechanical properties to increase the properties of the casting...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach: Influence of basic parameters of laser welding on shape {{and quality of the}} butt joints and the range of optimal parameters of welding were determined. Findings: It was showed that there is a wide range of laser autogenous welding parameters which ensures high quality joints of mechanical strength not lower than the strength of the base material (BM). The butt joints of austenitic steel AISI 321 sheets welded by the HPDL diode laser at optimal parameters are very high quality, without any internal imperfections and the structure and grain size of weld metal and HAZ is very small and also the HAZ is very narrow and the fusion zone is very regular.

30|$|In this study, we {{have tried}} that the forming {{approach}} of the austenitic stainless steels as well as forming the helicopter tail rotor piece of steel grade 301 to be examined. Herein, based on the theory of Liu et al., the blank holder force is ascendant varied in during the forming. The flowchart of the secondary blank holder force is used to simulate the forming of the <b>austenitic</b> stainless steel <b>sheet.</b> In addition, to reduce the work hardening during the forming process, the initial preheat conditions were considered. Some sheet samples were placed under the various temperature conditions, and their mechanical properties were compared with the sheet tested under the ambient conditions. The result of this comparison showed that to prevent the work hardening during the process and to prevent the structure-phase changes, the preheated temperature that equal to 350  °C has closest and most optimal properties {{with respect to the}} environment temperature. The mechanical properties such as stress-strain curve required for the simulation were considered based on the abovementioned temperature. Secondly, the forming boundary condition set {{in such a way that}} when the punch goes down to 30  mm at the mouth of the die, the blank holder force is progressively shifted from the initial amount of 30, 000 to 350, 000  N. In order to form the intended steel group 301, the forming tensile die was designed and built based on the critical section and a sample length of 200  mm. Also, the primary and secondary blank forces are obtained using trial and error by design and construction of PLC system to control the speed of the punch relative to the velocity of movement of the plate holder jaw carriage. The hydraulic lifting jack pressure and the driver jack of the holder jaw carriage were considered based on the forming required tonnage, and then the prototype was built. Finally, by point to point controlling the resulting piece with the nominal dimensions contained in the plot, and based on the obtained results, it was concluded that the most piece deviation in the critical sections to the nominal dimensions is 0.9 % that is acceptable based on the simulated logarithmic strain. Hence, it can be concluded that the piece springback has decreased. Meanwhile, by preheating the piece and cooling it under conditions of the ambient temperature, the amount of work hardening during the process is reached to its minimum value.|$|R
