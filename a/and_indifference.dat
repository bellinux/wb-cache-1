5|$|The most {{significant}} {{of the new}} contacts was Busoni. The great pianist and composer became Szigeti's mentor during these formative years, and the two would remain close friends until Busoni's death in 1924. By Szigeti's own admission, before meeting Busoni his life was characterized by a certain laziness <b>and</b> <b>indifference</b> {{brought on by the}} then-typical life of a young prodigy violinist. He had grown accustomed to playing crowd-pleasing salon miniatures and dazzling virtuosic encores without much thought. He knew little of the works of the great masters; he could play them, but not fully understand them. As Szigeti put it, Busoni—particularly through their careful study of Bach's Chaconne—"shook me once and for all out of my adolescent complacency".|$|E
5|$|E.V. Ramasamy {{joined the}} Indian National Congress in 1919 after quitting his {{business}} and resigning from public posts. He held the chairmanship of Erode Municipality and wholeheartedly undertook constructive programs spreading the use of Khadi, picketing toddy shops, boycotting shops selling foreign cloth, and eradicating untouchability. In 1921, Periyar courted imprisonment for picketing toddy shops in Erode. When his wife {{as well as his}} sister joined the agitation, it gained momentum, and the administration was forced to come to a compromise. He was again arrested during the Non-Cooperation movement and the Temperance movement. In 1922, Periyar was elected the President of the Madras Presidency Congress Committee during the Tirupur session, where he advocated strongly for reservation in government jobs and education. His attempts were defeated in the Congress party due to a strong presence of discrimination <b>and</b> <b>indifference,</b> which led to his leaving the party in 1925.|$|E

5|$|In Western Europe, after Theophrastus, botany {{passed through}} a bleak period of 1800 years when little {{progress}} was made and, indeed, many of the early insights were lost. As Europe entered the Middle Ages (5th to 15th centuries), a period of disorganised feudalism <b>and</b> <b>indifference</b> to learning, China, India and the Arab world enjoyed a golden age. Chinese philosophy had followed a similar path {{to that of the}} ancient Greeks. The Chinese dictionary-encyclopaedia Erh Ya probably dates from about 300 BC and describes about 334 plants classed as trees or shrubs, each with a common name and illustration. Between 100 and 1700 AD many new works on pharmaceutical botany were produced including encyclopaedic accounts and treatises compiled for the Chinese imperial court. These were free of superstition and myth with carefully researched descriptions and nomenclature; they included cultivation information and notes on economic and medicinal uses — and even elaborate monographs on ornamental plants. But there was no experimental method and no analysis of the plant sexual system, nutrition, or anatomy.|$|E
5|$|Sarah's frankness <b>and</b> <b>indifference</b> for rank, so {{admired by}} Anne earlier in their friendship, was now {{seen to be}} intrusive. Unlike most women of the time—many of whom did not have {{influence}} with their own husbands—Sarah had a powerful intimacy with the two most powerful men in the country, Marlborough and Godolphin. Godolphin, though a great friend of Sarah's, had even considered refusing high office after Anne's accession, preferring to live quietly {{and away from the}} political side of Sarah, who was bossy, interfering, and presumed to tell him what to do when Marlborough was away. Sarah, although a woman in a man's world of national and international politics, was always ready to give her advice; express her opinions; antagonize with outspoken censure; and insist on having her say on every possible occasion. However, she had a charm and vivaciousness which was admired by many; and she could easily delight those she met with her wit.|$|E

25|$|Action {{initiated}} by Spence {{to improve the}} financial sustainability of the university has alienated some students and staff.

Critics argue the push for savings has been driven by managerial incompetence <b>and</b> <b>indifference,</b> fuelling industrial action during a round of enterprise bargaining in 2013 that also reflected widespread concerns about public funding for higher education.|$|E
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{we study}} the <b>indifference</b> buyer's price <b>and</b> the <b>indifference</b> seller's price of an uncertainty averse decision-maker and {{the characterization of}} a decision maker's attitudes toward uncertainty. In {{the first part of}} the dissertation we study the properties fulfilled by the <b>indifference</b> buyer's price <b>and</b> by the <b>indifference</b> seller's price of an uncer- tainty averse decision-maker. We find that the indifference buyer's price is a quasiconvex risk measure <b>and</b> that the <b>indifference</b> seller's price is a cash-additive convex risk measure. We identify the acceptance family of the indifference buyer's price as well as the acceptance set of the indifference seller's price. We characterize the dual representations of the <b>indifference</b> buyer's price <b>and</b> of the <b>indifference</b> seller's price both in terms of probabil- ity charges and in terms of probability measures. In the second part of the dissertation we study the characterization of a decision-maker's attitudes toward uncertainty in terms of the <b>indifference</b> buyer's price <b>and</b> of the <b>indifference</b> seller's price. We find that a decision- maker is more uncertainty averse than another if and only if her <b>indifference</b> buyer's price <b>and</b> her <b>indifference</b> seller's price are larger than for the other. We find that a decision-maker is increasingly (respectively, decreasingly, con- stantly) uncertainty averse if and only if her <b>indifference</b> buyer's price <b>and</b> her <b>indifference</b> seller's price are increasing (respectively, decreasing, con- stant) functions of her constant initial wealth. In the last part of the dissertation we further develop the characterization of increasing, decreasing, and constant uncertainty aversion and we derive a technical condition that allows to immediately verify whether an uncer- tainty averse representation of preferences exhibits increasing, decreasing, or constant uncertainty aversion. We find that this technical condition allows 6 to classify a large class of uncertainty averse representations of preferences into increasingly, decreasingly, and constantly uncertainty averse.
