5|$|According to Russell's {{outlook on}} power, {{there are four}} {{conditions}} under which power ought to be pursued with moral conviction. First, it must be pursued only {{as a means to}} some end, and not as an end in itself; moreover, if it is <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself,</b> then it must be of comparatively lower value than one's other goals. Second, the ultimate goal must be to help satisfy the desires of others. Third, the means by which one pursues one's goal must not be egregious or malign, such that they outweigh the value of the end; as (for instance) the gassing of children for the sake of future democracy (Russell 1938:201). Fourth, moral doctrines should aim toward truth and honesty, not the manipulation of others (Russell 1938:216–218).|$|E
5|$|Quantrill's Raiders had {{a support}} network in Missouri, that {{provided}} them with numerous hiding places. Anderson's sisters aided the guerrillas by gathering information inside Union territory. In August 1863, however, Union General Thomas Ewing, Jr., attempted to thwart the guerrillas by arresting their female relatives, and Anderson's sisters were confined in a three-story building on Grand Avenue in Kansas City {{with a number of}} other girls. While they were confined, the building collapsed, killing one of Anderson's sisters. In the aftermath, rumors that the building had been intentionally sabotaged by Union soldiers spread quickly; Anderson was convinced that it had been a deliberate act. Biographer Larry Wood wrote that Anderson's motivation shifted {{after the death of his}} sister, arguing that killing then became his focus—and an enjoyable act. Castel and Goodrich maintain that killing became more than a means to an end at that point for Anderson: it became <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{unitary state}} was not <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself,</b> but {{a means to}} higher ends. The {{republic}} had been in dire financial straits even before the revolution of 1795. The system of public finance {{that had been the}} envy of the world in its Golden Age, enabling it to throw far beyond its weight in world politics up to the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, had become a millstone around its neck. By 1713 the public debt of the province of Holland had reached 310 million guilders; the debt of the Generality was 68 million; and the debts of the smaller provinces, and of the cities came on top of this. The debt service of Holland alone in that year required 14 million guilders, which exceeded its regular tax revenue. Most of this humongous public debt was held by Dutch private citizens, so in a sense it merely engendered an internal money circuit in the Dutch economy. However, it was mostly concentrated {{in the hands of the}} rentier class, while the debt was serviced by mainly regressive taxes that weighed on the working population. Most importantly, these were taxes levied by the individual provinces, who serviced their own debt, and paid into the Generality coffers according to a repartition schedule last changed in 1616. Attempts to reform this structure during the 18th century were mainly fruitless.|$|E

25|$|With {{regard to}} morality, Kant {{argued that the}} source of the good lies not in {{anything}} outside the human subject, either in nature or given by God, but rather is only the good will itself. A good will is one that acts from duty in accordance with the universal moral law that the autonomous human being freely gives itself. This law obliges one to treat humanityunderstood as rational agency, and represented through oneself as well as othersas <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> rather than (merely) as means to other ends the individual might hold. This necessitates practical self-reflection in which we universalize our reasons.|$|E
5000|$|Virtue {{ethics is}} a form of ethical theory which emphasises the {{character}} of an agent, rather than specific acts; many of its proponents have criticised Kant's deontological approach to ethics. Elizabeth Anscombe criticised modern ethical theories, including Kantian ethics, for their obsession with law and obligation. As well as arguing that theories which rely on a universal moral law are too rigid, Anscombe suggested that, because a moral law implies a moral lawgiver, they are irrelevant in modern secular society. In his work After Virtue, Alasdair MacIntyre criticises Kant's formulation of universalisability, arguing that various trivial and immoral maxims can pass the test, such as [...] "Keep all your promises throughout your entire life except one". He further challenges Kant's formulation of humanity as <b>an</b> <b>ends</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> by arguing that Kant provided no reason to treat others as means: the maxim [...] "Let everyone except me be treated as a means", though seemingly immoral, can be universalised. Bernard Williams argues that, by abstracting persons from character, Kant misrepresents persons and morality and Philippa Foot identified Kant as one of a select group of philosophers responsible for the neglect of virtue by analytic philosophy.|$|R

It is not necessarily that these partisans have embraced nonpartisanship as <b>a</b> positive <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself,</b> however. Rather, the Budget Committees (and especially their leadership and staff) have recognized that a weak CBO (one {{that does not have}} a reputation for objective analysis, and whose conclusions are viewed as partisan) is not in their interest. A weak CBO weakens the Budget Committees, and indeed weakens Congress as a whole in its inevitable battles with the executive over budget and economic policy.|$|R
25|$|Cruelty to animals, {{also called}} animal abuse, animal neglect or simply animal cruelty, is the infliction by {{omission}} (animal neglect) or by commission by humans of suffering or harm upon any non-human animal, {{regardless of whether}} the act is against the law. More narrowly, it can be the causing of harm or suffering for specific achievement, such as killing animals for food or for their fur; opinions differ about the extent of cruelty associated with a given method of slaughter.

Carter saw his ideas as rooted in Hindu advaita, in which the human experiences of separateness, duality and temporality are held {{to be a kind of}} dance or play of cosmic consciousness in which everything is sacred, has absolute worth and is <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself.</b> While his contemporary Jiddu Krishnamurti did not approve of Rajneesh, there are clear similarities between their respective teachings.|$|E
25|$|Alongside populism, Herzen is also {{remembered for}} his {{rejection}} of corrupt government of any political persuasion {{and for his}} support for individual rights.

30|$|One of the {{important}} reasons for emphasizing the immediate availability of the ātman, and clarifying {{the nature of the}} ignorance pertaining to it, is that it establishes the possibility of the words of the Upaniṣads giving rise to direct and immediate knowledge.

Śankarāchārya accepts that the knowledge derived through words is not <b>a</b> fruitful <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> if the object about which are informed is not yet in existence or not immediately available.

25|$|In {{his famous}} work, Adhyatmopanisatprakarana {{he argued that}} no body of ‘theory’ (sastra), whether Jain or non-Jain, is to be {{accepted}} merely {{on the basis of}} sectarian interest. Instead, the theory should be subject to testing, just as the purity of a sample of gold is determined by tests involving rubbing, cutting and heating (1.17) In one of the ethical works, the Jnanasara, Yashovijaya describes 32 moral and intellectual virtues that constitute a virtuous character. Out of these, two are distinctive: neutrality (madhyasthata) and groundedness in all view-points (sarvanayasraya). Neutrality is explained in terms of the dispassionate use of reason: a person who embodies this virtue follows wherever reason leads, rather than using reason only to defend prior opinions (16.2). Yashovijaya stresses that neutrality is not <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself,</b> but a means to another end. We adopt a neutral attitude, he says, in the hope it leads to well-being (hita), just as someone who knows that one among a group of herbs is restorative but does not know which one it is, acts reasonably if they swallow the entire lot (16.8).|$|E

He advocates economic localisation {{in the same vein}} as many in the Green movement, although only as a prefigurative step rather than <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself.</b> He also advises political parties attempting to “democratize the state” that there should be “dialogue but no compromise” with established political parties, and that there must be “a continual association of electoral work with movement work” to avoid “being sucked back into the system”. Such parties, he believes, should focus on “the local rungs of the political system” first, before running national campaigns that “challenge the existing system by the elementary means of exposing its broken promises”.|$|E
25|$|On 10 May 1940, the Wehrmacht invaded and conquered The Netherlands, Belgium and France within 46 days, {{securing}} the French capitulation on 25 June 1940. The conquest of Western Europe was not <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself,</b> {{but rather a}} means to an end. The occupation of France positioned the Germans for an air and naval assault on the United Kingdom. The strategic advantage gained by the possession of French air and naval bases on the Atlantic coast put German U-Boats and aircraft some 700 miles closer to the critical Allied shipping lanes and within range of British ports in the south, east, west and north. This enabled the German submarines to reach much deeper into the Atlantic, {{all the way to the}} western seaboard of the United States and Canada—the later being a major source of resources and protection in the shape of the Royal Canadian Navy; the third largest navy in the world by 1945. This advantage enabled the U-Boats to avoid the very dangerous passage to the Atlantic through the North Sea, or worse, the heavily mined English Channel. Critically, it allowed for deep Atlantic air operations by the Luftwaffe.|$|E
