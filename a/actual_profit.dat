50|$|At {{the end of}} one year, {{suppose that}} the current market {{valuation}} of Andy's house is $110,000. Then, because Andy is obliged to sell to Bob for only $104,000, Bob will make a profit of $6,000. To see why this is so, one needs only to recognize that Bob can buy from Andy for $104,000 and immediately sell to the market for $110,000. Bob has made the difference in profit. In contrast, Andy has made a potential loss of $6,000, and an <b>actual</b> <b>profit</b> of $4,000.|$|E

It is the <b>actual</b> <b>profit,</b> and includes the operating expenses that are excluded from gross profit. In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, 91% responded that they found the net profit metric very useful.

50|$|YPF {{nonetheless}} {{remained the}} 365th largest {{firm in the}} world, with sales of over US$4 billion in 1992. Argentine President Carlos Menem initiated the privatization of YPF through an IPO on the New York and other stock exchanges on 28 June 1993, at a value of US$3 billion for stock equal to a 45% share in the company. During the 18 {{months prior to the}} IPO, YPF underwent a massive restructuring process led by its new CEO José Estenssoro, who had been appointed by President Menem. The staff of YPF was reduced from 52,000 to 10,600 through layoffs agreed with unions and outsourcing of services to companies established by former YPF employees during the restructuring process. The financial bottom line for the company was increased from a loss about $1 billion in 1991 (although the accounting system at the time could not accurately compute <b>actual</b> <b>profit)</b> to a profit of $1 billion in 1993, and the underlying value of YPF was increased from about US$2 billion to the US$9 billion after privatization.|$|E

The results show that forecast accuracy compares favourably with the findings from the developed economies of Australia, Britain, Canada, and New Zealand. Forecasts are shown to be superior to the predictions from time series models. IPOs tend to underforecast in the sense that <b>actual</b> <b>profits</b> exceed the forecasts.

Existing studies on information externalities focus on overconfidence in privately acquired information, but ignore the effects of being overly optimistic about one’s competences and idiosyncratic risks, i. e. optimistic overconfidence. Despite the importance for entrepreneurship policies, analyses on the optimal magnitudes of such biases, their prevalence within populations, and their relations to market size, are largely absent in the literature...|$|R

50|$|Company’s {{long-term}} {{sales and}} profit objective are developed from extensive analysis of relevant {{information relating to}} customers, market and products. Only realistic plan is accepted to process the next step. Product mix is designed carefully {{to ensure that it}} satisfies many customers, but also does not contain too many products to confuse customers. Company may use simulation to explore the impact of overall profit objective to different product mixes and determine the most feasible product mix. Target selling price, target profit margin and allowable cost are identified for each product. Target selling price need to consider to the expected market condition at the time launching the product. Internal factors such as product’s functionality and profit objective, and external factors such as company’s image or expected price of competitive products will influence target selling price. Company’s long-term profit plan and life-cycle cost are considered when determining target profit margin. Firms might set up target profit margin based on either <b>actual</b> <b>profit</b> margin of previous products or target profit margin of product line. Simulation for overall group profitability can help to make sure achieving group target. Subtracting target profit margin from target selling price results in allowable cost for each product. Allowable cost is the cost that can spend on the product to ensure meeting profit target if selling it at target price. It is the signal about the magnitude of cost saving that team need to achieve.|$|E
