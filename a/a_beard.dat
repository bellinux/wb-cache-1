5|$|Fanny Longfellow died in {{the home}} in July 1861 after her dress accidentally caught fire; her husband {{attempted}} to quell the flames, managing to keep her face from burning. Longfellow himself was burned on his own face and was scarred badly enough that he began growing <b>a</b> <b>beard</b> to hide it.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Miles {{returns to}} Home and Away {{with a new}} look. Miles had lost weight, cut his hair short and grew <b>a</b> <b>beard.</b> Off-screen Quong Tart had such a busy {{schedule}} that he lost weight. When he revealed his new look to producers, they were so impressed they decided to change Miles' image, because it suited the storyline.|$|E

50|$|The {{portrait}} of the king is almost exclusively known from his coinage. It is possible to identify several types of depiction in the coinage. He can be shown with <b>a</b> short <b>beard</b> and <b>a</b> diadem, but there are images which show him with <b>a</b> mid-length <b>beard</b> or with <b>a</b> long <b>beard,</b> still wearing the diadem. A completely different type of image shows him with a high domed tiara on his head.|$|R
50|$|The {{removal of}} <b>a</b> full <b>beard</b> often {{requires}} {{the use of}} scissors or <b>an</b> electric (or <b>beard)</b> trimmer to reduce the mass of hair, simplifying the process.|$|R
5|$|Lincoln's {{portrait}} {{appears on}} two denominations of United States currency, the penny and the $5 bill. His likeness also appears on many postage stamps {{and he has}} been memorialized in many town, city, and county names, including the capital of Nebraska. While he is usually portrayed bearded, he first grew <b>a</b> <b>beard</b> in 1860 at the suggestion of 11-year-old Grace Bedell.|$|E
5|$|Five years later, Woodruff disguises {{himself with}} <b>a</b> <b>beard</b> and monocle and assumes a new {{identity}} {{in an attempt to}} court Allen. She is able to recognize him as Woodruff because of his fear of fire tongs. Because she is friends with the governor, she is able to arrange her husband's release from prison. Victor locates Woodruff in a casino and kills him. At trial, he declares that the prohibition against double jeopardy prevents his prosecution for the murder; he is set free to live happily with his wife.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} four years Shaw made a {{negligible}} income from writing, and was subsidised by his mother. In 1881, for the sake of economy, and increasingly as a matter of principle, he became a vegetarian. He grew <b>a</b> <b>beard</b> to hide a facial scar left by smallpox. In rapid succession he wrote two more novels: The Irrational Knot (1880) and Love Among the Artists (1881), but neither found a publisher; each was serialised a few years later in the socialist magazine Our Corner.|$|E
50|$|He {{created his}} {{well-known}} alter ego, Father Abraham, after writing a Dutch Carnival song, Father Abraham had seven sons. He at first used <b>a</b> fake <b>beard,</b> but <b>a</b> real <b>beard</b> replaced this and would remain his trademark {{along with his}} bowler hat.|$|R

5|$|In late April 2004, Fertig {{was called}} up to the SmackDown! brand with vignettes playing on the show announcing his new character, Mordecai, a {{religious}} Zealot-type character, which was partially based on his previous Seven gimmick. During numerous promos, Mordecai claimed {{to be on a}} crusade to rid the world of sin. He consistently wore white and had blonde hair and <b>a</b> <b>beard</b> as a sign of his purity. Mordecai debuted in ring for the SmackDown! brand on May 16, 2004 during the Judgment Day pay-per-view, defeating Scotty 2 Hotty. In later appearances, Mordecai condemned the audience for their sins, and led them in prayer. Fertig's Mordecai character was originally created to have a feud with The Undertaker.|$|E
5|$|The {{fan base}} went wild, and a riotous celebration {{gathered}} at Ebisu Bridge in Dōtonbori, Osaka. There, {{an assemblage of}} supporters yelled the players' names, and with every name, a fan resembling {{a member of the}} victorious team leaped from the bridge into the waiting canal. However, lacking a Caucasian person to imitate MVP Randy Bass, the rabid crowd seized a plastic statue of Colonel Sanders (like Bass, the Colonel had <b>a</b> <b>beard</b> and was not Japanese) from a nearby KFC and tossed it off the bridge as an effigy.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh's gaze {{is seldom}} {{directed}} at the viewer. The portraits vary in intensity and colour, and in those painted after December 1888 especially, the vivid colours highlight the haggard pallor of his skin. Some depict the artist with <b>a</b> <b>beard,</b> others without. He can be seen with bandages in portraits executed just after he mutilated his ear. In only a few does he depict himself as a painter. Those painted in Saint-Rémy show the head from the right, the side opposite his damaged ear, as he painted himself reflected in his mirror.|$|E
50|$|However, {{within the}} Foreign Legion, sappers are {{traditionally}} encouraged to grow <b>a</b> large <b>beard.</b> Sappers chosen {{to participate in}} the Bastille Day parade are in fact specifically asked to stop shaving so they will have <b>a</b> full <b>beard</b> when they march down the Champs-Élysées.|$|R

Based upon a case ordering California officials to allow Muslim prisoners to grow <b>a</b> half-inch <b>beard,</b> Holt requested permission to grow <b>a</b> half-inch <b>beard</b> only, as <b>a</b> [...] "compromise". His request was rejected.|$|R

5|$|On December 17, 1955, viewers {{were able}} to see {{first-hand}} what Perry did for a living before he was a professional singer. Actor Kirk Douglas was one of Como's television guests; Douglas had grown <b>a</b> <b>beard</b> for his Vincent van Gogh role in Lust For Life, which finished filming that week. Como shaved Douglas' movie beard live on national television. On September 15, 1956, the season premiere of The Perry Como Show was broadcast from NBC's new color television studios at the New York Ziegfeld Theatre, {{making it one of the}} first weekly color TV shows. In addition to this season premiere as a color television show, there was also a royal visit from Prince Rainier of Monaco and his bride of six months, Grace Kelly.|$|E
5|$|Schnauzers have a {{specific}} groom cut that is standard among the Schnauzer breed. Schnauzers require regular grooming, either by stripping (mostly seen in show dogs), or by clipping (a short-cut usually reserved for family pets). Stripping removes the loose, dead coat; it may be done by hand, called finger stripping, or plucking, or with a stripping knife; either way, it is a laborious process. Many Miniature Schnauzers who are family pets have regular grooming appointments to have their hair clipped; clipping, using a mechanical clippers (or shaver), produces a soft, silky, skin-close trim. Whether stripped or clipped, the coat is close at the body, and falls into a fringe-like foundation on its undercarriage, called furnishings, which can be left to grow, but must be combed regularly. All Schnauzers, whether they are Miniatures, Standards, or Giants, often sport <b>a</b> <b>beard,</b> created by allowing the hair around their noses to grow out. Left unclipped or unstripped, the body hair will grow two to four inches, and will often tangle into mats and curls.|$|E
5|$|In 1546, {{the conservatives}} in a {{coalition}} including Gardiner, the Duke of Norfolk, the Lord Chancellor Wriothesley, and {{the bishop of}} London, Edmund Bonner, made one last attempt to challenge the reformers. Several reformers with links to Cranmer were targeted. Some such as Lascelles were burnt at the stake. However, powerful reform-minded nobles Edward Seymour and John Dudley returned to England during the summer from overseas {{and they were able}} to turn the tide against the conservatives. Two incidents in autumn tipped the balance. Gardiner was disgraced before the king when he refused to agree to exchange episcopal estates, and the son of the Duke of Norfolk was charged with treason and executed. There is no evidence that Cranmer played any part in these political games, and there were no further plots as the king's health ebbed in his final months. Cranmer performed his final duties for the king on 28 January 1547 when he gave a reformed statement of faith while gripping Henry's hand instead of giving him his last rites. Cranmer mourned Henry's death and it was later said that he demonstrated his grief by growing <b>a</b> <b>beard.</b> The beard was also a sign of his break with the past. Continental reformers grew beards to mark their rejection of the old Church and this significance of clerical beards was well understood in England. On 31 January, he was among the executors of the king's final will that nominated Edward Seymour as Lord Protector and welcomed the boy king, Edward VI.|$|E

5|$|July 9, 1861 {{was a hot}} day, and Fanny {{was putting}} locks of her children's hair into an {{envelope}} and attempting to seal it with hot sealing wax while Longfellow took a nap. Her dress suddenly caught fire, though it is unclear exactly how; burning wax or a lighted candle may have fallen onto it. Longfellow was awakened from his nap and rushed to help her, throwing a rug over her, though it was too small. He stifled the flames with his body as best he could, but she was already badly burned. Over half a century later, Longfellow's youngest daughter Annie explained the story differently, claiming {{that there had been}} no candle or wax but that the fire had started from a self-lighting match that had fallen on the floor. Both accounts state that Fanny was taken to her room to recover and a doctor was called. She {{was in and out of}} consciousness throughout the night and was administered ether. She died shortly after 10:00 the next morning, July 10, after requesting a cup of coffee. Longfellow, in trying to save her, had burned himself badly enough so that he was unable to attend her funeral. His facial injuries led him to stop shaving, and he wore <b>a</b> <b>beard</b> from then on that became his trademark.|$|E
