40|$|This article {{considers}} {{whether a}} welfare reform policy intended to empower disabled persons by moving them from dependency on welfare {{benefits to the}} independence of employment may instead exacerbate social exclusion. It argues that potential conflicts between employers' responsibilities under health and safety law and a duty of non-discrimination introduced by the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 must be resolved if this outcome is to be avoided. An interpretation of statutory duties to reconcile health and safety protectionism with a principle of non-discrimination for disabled persons is examined. The analysis suggests that protectionism {{gives rise to a}} potential for paternalistic decision-making on the part of employers who may refuse to accept residual risks to employees 'in their own best interests' or those of others. The standard of acceptable risk as evolved within the context of health and safety law is analysed, and found to allow paternalistic protectionism and commercial interest to override an employee's autonomous choice to accept risk, even where acceptance offers a disabled person the only opportunity to work. The article argues that this is inappropriate in the newly created context of non-discrimination and proposes development of the concept of reasonable practicability within which a standard of acceptable risk resides. An autonomy model of reasonable practicability is advocated as a mechanism for recognising the interests of all parties affected by decisions on the acceptability health and safety risk. Although the focus is primarily on persons who meet the definition of disability given in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, many other people who fall outside it face exclusion from work on the grounds of health and safety risk. The article concludes that adoption of an autonomy model of reasonable practicability plays a necessary part in ending the social exclusion faced by all persons, disabled and non-disabled, who attempt to enter the workplace only to find their <b>access</b> <b>barred</b> by the seemingly insurmountable barriers of health and safety risks to themselves or others...|$|E

40|$|Cellular Internet of Things (C-IoT) {{is one of}} the {{emerging}} 5 G technologies. 4 G LTE being the most promising cellular technology so far and is a suitor for serving C-IoT devices. In future millions of C-IoT devices will be deployed in the coverage of a single 4 G LTE base station. However, the existing random access (RACH) mechanism in 4 G LTE is not designed to connect millions of devices. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel RACH mechanism that allows millions of C-IoT devices to associate with the base station within the existing 4 G LTE framework. 3 GPP has proposed an extended <b>access</b> <b>barring</b> mechanism to solve this problem for machine type communication (MTC). We compare the performance of the proposed RACH mechanism with the existing 3 GPP extended <b>access</b> <b>barring</b> mechanism through analysis.

The {{purpose of this}} research was to examine the effect of the <b>Access</b> <b>bar</b> on endurance running performance. Twelve active, healthy run-ners completed 5 sessions: a V̇O 2 max test, a 30 -minute fa-miliarization session, and 3 experimental sessions. During each experimental session subjects ran a self-paced, simulat-ed race on a treadmill (approximately 55 minutes) until they had completed a set energy expenditure target (0. 8368 kJ 3 60 minutes 3 body mass). Fifteen minutes before exercise subjects received either the <b>Access</b> <b>bar</b> and water, Uncle To-bys Peanut Butter Muesli Bar and water, or Crystal Light, using a randomized, double-blind design.

40|$|Synchronized Random Access Channel (RACH) {{attempts}} by Internet of Things (IoT) devices {{could result in}} Radio Access Network (RAN) overload in LTE-A. 3 GPP adopted <b>Barring</b> Bitmap Enabled-Extended <b>Access</b> <b>Barring</b> (EAB-BB) mechanism that announces the EAB information (i. e., a list of <b>barred</b> <b>Access</b> Classes) through a barring bitmap as the baseline solution to mitigate the RAN overload. EAB-BB was analyzed for its optimal performance in a recent work. However, {{there has been no}} work that analyzes <b>Barring</b> Factor Enabled-Extended <b>Access</b> <b>Barring</b> (EAB-BF), an alternative mechanism that was considered during the standardization process. Due to the modeling complexity involved, not only has it been difficult to analyze EAB-BF, but also, a much more far-reaching issue, like the effect of these schemes on key network performance parameter, like eNodeB energy consumption, has been overlooked. In this regard, for the first time, we develop a novel analytical model for EAB-BF to obtain its performance metrics. Results obtained from our analysis and simulation are seen to match very well. Furthermore, we also build an eNodeB energy consumption model to serve the IoT RACH requests. We then show that our analytical and energy consumption models can be combined to obtain EAB-BF settings that can minimize eNodeB energy consumption, while simultaneously providing optimal Quality of Service (QoS) performance. Results obtained reveal that the optimal performance of EAB-BF is better than that of EAB-BB. Furthermore, we also show that not only all the three 3 GPP-proposed EAB-BF settings considered during standardization provide sub-optimal QoS to devices, but also result in excessive eNodeB energy consumption, thereby acutely penalizing the network. Finally, we provide corrections to these 3 GPP-settings that can lead to significant gains in EAB-BF performance. Comment: 14 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

40|$|Cellular {{network is}} {{provisioned}} to serve traffic demands generated by human being. The {{random access channel}} used for nodes to compete for a connection with an eNB is limited. Even though machines generate very small amount of data traffic, the signaling channel of a network becomes overloaded and collisions occur to fail the access if too many MTC (Machine Type Communication) devices attempt to access network. To tackle the issue, 3 GPP specifies an <b>access</b> class <b>barring</b> but leaves a specific algorithm as an implementation issue. In this paper, we propose an adaptive <b>access</b> <b>barring</b> method. Generally, an eNB does not know the number of MTC devices in its coverage area. Thus, {{it is difficult to}} control the barring factor by predicting the number of MTC devices in a service area of a cell. On the contrary, we control the barring factor based on the prediction of access intensity which can be measured at an eNB. Simulation results show that since the proposed method can manipulate the barring factor autonomously according to the access intensity, it is superior to the original method in terms of the access success probability and the collision probability...|$|R

30|$|Several {{works have}} been {{proposed}} to improve the performance of random access, with a particular attention to machine-to-machine communication (small low duty cycle packets). Reference [5] investigates a resource allocation scheme for spatial multi-group random access to reduce packet collision in a single cell and interference among multiple cells. Authors in [6] proposes a collision resolution method for random access based on the fixed timing advance information for fixed-location devices in LTE/LTE-A. Authors in [7] introduce a code-expanded method for random access in LTE/LTE-A, where the amount of available contention access resources is expanded to reduce the collision rate. Reference [8] investigates a cooperative random <b>access</b> class <b>barring</b> scheme for global stabilization and access load sharing. In the proposed method, each groups are assigned with specific <b>access</b> class <b>barring</b> to differentiate <b>access</b> priorities. Authors in [9] present a prioritized random access scheme to provide quality of service (QoS) for different classes, where different access priorities are achieved through different backoff procedures. Reference [10] points out some possible directions for controlling the overhead of random access, namely <b>access</b> class <b>barring</b> schemes, separate random access channel (RACH) resource for machine-type device, dynamic allocation of RACH resource, specific backoff scheme for the machine-type devices, slotted access, and pull-based scheme. Splitting the random access preambles into two (non-)overlapping sets, one for human type communication {{and the other for}} the machine type communication are proposed by 3 GPP [11] as a mean to control the collision rate.|$|R

30|$|In a {{traditional}} ACB procedure, an eNB broadcasts access probability (AP) and <b>access</b> class (AC) <b>barring</b> time within a cell [19]. When a device initiates the RA mechanism, it draws a number between 0 and 1. The {{result of the}} draw is compared with AP. If the result is less than AP, the device can proceed with the RA mechanism. Otherwise, device has {{to wait for a}} duration of AC barring. In Release 10 and onward, 3 GPP has proposed an extended <b>access</b> <b>barring</b> (EAB) mechanism in which a certain class of delay tolerant traffic cannot perform the RA procedure whenever an EAB is initiated [108]. The eNB can control the PRACH overload by decreasing the AP value. Resultantly, it lowers the RA attempts. However, it might increase the RA delay for certain devices. Furthermore, in a cooperative ACB mechanism [109], an eNB selects the value of ACB depending on the level of network congestion. An optimization problem is considered to balance the number of MTC devices attached to a single eNB. However, the drawback of the proposed approach {{is that it does not}} consider the priority of MTC devices. In order to cope with this limitation, a priority-aware RA (PRA) scheme is proposed in [110] which takes into account the priority of MTC devices. PRACHs are pre-allocated to multiple MTC classes by adopting a class dependent backoff procedure.|$|R
