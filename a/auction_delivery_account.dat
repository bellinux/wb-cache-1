One hundred and forty four deaths (37 %) {{were found to be}} due to lethal or severe malformations, an incidence of 2. 2 / 1000 births. Of the 242 normally formed infants, 111 (46 %) died within 24 hours of birth. Seventy seven (32 %) weighed over 2500 g at birth. Factors operating before <b>delivery</b> <b>accounted</b> for 104 (43 %) of the deaths of normally formed infants.

The aim of this thesis was to describe challenges in perinatal health in a Vietnamese province, and to evaluate the effect of a facilitated intervention with local stakeholder groups that used a problem-solving approach to neonatal survival during three years. The NeoKIP trial (Neonatal Knowledge Into Practice, ISRCTN 44599712) had a cluster-randomized design (44 intervention communes, 46 control). Laywomen facilitated Maternal-and-Newborn Health Groups (MNHGs) and used Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles to address perinatal health problems. Births and neonatal deaths were monitored. Interviews were performed in households of neonatal deaths and randomly selected live births. Use of health services was mapped. The primary healthcare staff’s knowledge on newborn care was assessed before and after the intervention. Neonatal mortality rate (NMR) was 16 / 1000 live births (variation 10 - 44 / 1000 between districts).

40|$|Insulin has an exercise-like {{action to}} {{increase}} microvascular perfusion of skeletal muscle and thereby enhance delivery of hormone and nutrient to the myocytes. With insulin resistance, insulin's action to increase microvascular perfusion is markedly impaired. This review examines the present status of these observations and techniques available to measure such changes {{as well as}} the possible underpinning mechanisms. Low physiological doses of insulin and light exercise have been shown to increase microvascular perfusion without increasing bulk blood flow. In these circumstances, blood flow is proposed to be redirected from the nonnutritive route to the nutritive route with flow becoming dominant in the nonnutritive route when insulin resistance has developed. Increased vasomotion controlled by vascular smooth muscle may be part of the explanation by which insulin mediates an increase in microvascular perfusion, as seen from the effects of insulin on both muscle and skin microvascular blood flow. In addition, vascular dysfunction appears to be an early development in the onset of insulin resistance, with the consequence that impaired glucose delivery, more so than insulin <b>delivery,</b> <b>accounts</b> for the diminished glucose uptake by insulin-resistant muscle. Regular exercise may prevent and ameliorate insulin resistance by increasing "vascular fitness" and thereby recovering insulin-mediated capillary recruitment...|$|R

Examination {{of the experience of}} caesarean delivery is limited, although as caesarean delivery rates are increasing, a practical understanding of the constructs surrounding surgical birth needs to be gained. This review aims to present an overview of the current literature exploring the mother 2 ̆ 7 s experience of caesarean delivery. The different modes of medically necessary caesarean delivery, both unplanned and planned are defined. Societal views of caesarean birth as an easier and convenient mode of delivery in comparison to vaginal birth are described and it is suggested that this perception is unjust and misrepresentative of the actual experience. The impact of delivery on appraisal of childbirth satisfaction and the incongruence between personal expectations and delivery are also explored. Psychological adjustment in the postpartum is an area of incongruent literature, although qualitative studies are defining the links between caesarean delivery and high rates of anxiety and fear. The association between caesarean delivery and postnatal depression and post traumatic stress disorder is also presented. The importance of the utilisation of qualitative and interactive research methodology to explore the experience of caesarean birth and the practical implications for psychological adjustment after caesarean delivery are discussed...|$|R

Poor prognostic factors of these tumors are the apparent (occurrence) of hydrops before 30 weeks in utero and occupying more solid component. In prenatal term characterization of this tumor can be made by B scan Doppler ultrasonography and three-dimensional (3 D) ultrasonography.

We conducted a population-based, retrospective study by linking school census data on the 407, 503 eligible school-aged children resident in 19 Scottish Local Authority areas (total population 3. 8 million) to their routine birth data. SEN was recorded in 17, 784 (4. 9 %) children; 1, 565 (8. 4 %) of those born preterm and 16, 219 (4. 7 %) of those born at term. The risk of SEN increased across the whole range of gestation from 40 to 24 wk: 37 - 39 wk adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1. 16, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 12 - 1. 20; 33 - 36 wk adjusted OR 1. 53, 95 % CI 1. 43 - 1. 63; 28 - 32 wk adjusted OR 2. 66, 95 % CI 2. 38 - 2. 97; 24 - 27 wk adjusted OR 6. 92, 95 % CI 5. 58 - 8. 58.

Because of their high frequency, early term deliveries (37 - 39 wk) accounted for 5. 5 % of cases of SEN compared with preterm deliveries (< 37 wk), which accounted for only 3. 6 % of cases. Gestation at delivery had a strong, dose-dependent relationship with SEN that was apparent across the whole range of gestation.

40|$|Front-end {{instruction}} <b>delivery</b> <b>accounts</b> for {{a significant}} fraction of energy consumption in dynamically scheduled superscalar processors. Different front-end throttling techniques have been introduced to reduce the chip-wide energy consumption caused by redundant fetching. Hardwarebased techniques, such as flow-based throttling, could reduce the energy consumption considerably, but with a high performance loss. On the other hand, compiler-based IPCestimation-driven software fetch throttling (CFT) techniques result in relatively low performance degradation, which is desirable for high-performance processors. However, their energy savings are limited {{by the fact that}} they typically use a predefined fixed low IPC-threshold to control throttling. In this paper, we propose a Compiler-based Adaptive Fetch Throttling (CAFT) technique that allows changing the throttling threshold dynamically at runtime. Instead of using a fixed threshold, our technique uses the Decode/Issue Difference (DID) to assist the fetch throttling decision based on the statically estimated IPC. Changing the threshold dynamically makes it possible to throttle at a higher estimated IPC, thus increasing the throttling opportunities and resulting in larger energy savings. We demonstrate that CAFT could increase the energy savings significantly compared to CFT, while preserving its benefit of low performance loss. Our simulation results show that the proposed technique doubles the energy-delay product (EDP) savings compared to the fixed threshold throttling and achieves a 6. 7 % average EDP saving. 1...|$|R

Last-mile home <b>delivery</b> <b>accounts</b> for a substantial portion of total e-grocery fulfillment costs. The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, is examined in the context of e-grocery and its impact on last-mile delivery costs.

Practical analytical approaches, as well as new case experiments, serve as a framework of recommendations for an emerging e-grocer or similar last-mile delivery provider.
