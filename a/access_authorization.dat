50|$|Access {{controllability}} {{means that}} a data owner can perform the selective restriction of access to his data outsourced to cloud. Legal users can be authorized by the owner to access the data, while others can not access it without permissions. Further, it is desirable to enforce fine-grained access control to the outsourced data, i.e., different users should be granted different access privileges with regard to different data pieces. The <b>access</b> <b>authorization</b> must be controlled only by the owner in untrusted cloud environments.|$|E

50|$|UMA adds {{three main}} {{concepts}} and corresponding structures and flows. First, it defines a standardized API at the AS, called the protection API, that the RS speaks to; this enables multiple RS’s {{to communicate with}} one AS and vice versa, and because the API is itself secured with OAuth, allows for formal trust establishment between each pair. This also allows an AS to present an RO with a centralized user interface. Second, UMA defines a formal notion of a requesting party (RqP) that is autonomous from an RO, enabling party-to-party sharing and delegation of <b>access</b> <b>authorization.</b> An RO need not consent to token issuance at run time but can set policy at an AS, allowing an RqP to attempt access asynchronously. Third, UMA enables access attempts to result in successful issuance of tokens associated with authorization data based on a process of trust elevation in the RqP, for example, gathering identity claims or other claims from them.|$|E

In {{the comfort of}} their own homes, {{with the help of}} wireless PDAs and portable computers, people may enjoy high quality care from a well-orchestrated team of healthcare professionals.

This system is designed to work on resource-limited mobile devices over a peer-to-peer wireless network. Dynamic <b>access</b> <b>authorization</b> is achieved on the mobile device in real time by actively collecting context information, integrating the appropriate access control rules, and performing logical inference.

40|$|Knowledge centric {{management}} (KCM) {{has become}} a key strategy for competitive edge. As an essential of KCM, an enterprise ontology represents the knowledge of an organization. Thus, the need for securing enterprise ontologies (EO) becomes imperative. Adequate access control is {{a major component of}} ontology security. However, access control for EO is largely neglected in information systems (IS) literature. This paper presents the first research to fill this gap. I propose five requirements for good access-control solutions for EO. The proposed solution offers an architecture framework that meets the five requirements. Semantic Web technology is used to build context-aware access controls into EO. My proposal includes a novel resolution for policy conflicts.

40|$|Abstract—Sharing digital {{contents}} on the Web {{has become}} one of the most popular activities on the Internet. When the contents are sensitive in nature, sharing them online has security implications. Recently social relations are used extensively as access constraints to secure the content sharing. However only relation cannot provide personalized and granular enough access control. To mitigate the problems, this paper proposes an <b>access</b> <b>authorization</b> model incorporating diverse real life social relations and associated attributes such as trust, distance of relations and frequency of interactions. The model comprises of a formal knowledge base and personalized <b>access</b> <b>authorization</b> policies. We implement the model using the capabilities of semantic technologies. The paper also demonstrates practical applications of such model. Index Terms—access control, ontology, policy, relation, semantic technolog...|$|E
