I'd like to let you all know, despite the situation – I know {{all of you are}} still convinced that I'm the person that killed your father, your son and your brother, but I am innocent. The incident that happened that night was not my fault. I did not have a gun that night. I did not shoot your family member. But I am so sorry for your loss. I really am – sincerely. All I can ask is that each of you look deeper into this case, so that you really will finally see the truth. I <b>ask</b> <b>my</b> family and friends that you all continue to pray, that you all continue to forgive. Continue to fight this fight. For those about to take my life, may God have mercy on all of your souls. God bless you all. He was declared dead at 11:08pm EDT.|$|E
500|$|After the Angel of the Lord returned, Manoah {{asked him}} his name, but he said, [...] "Why do you <b>ask</b> <b>my</b> name? It is beyond understanding." [...] Manoah then {{prepared}} a sacrifice, but the Angel of the Lord would only {{allow it to}} be for God. He touched it with his staff, miraculously engulfing it in flames, and then ascended into the sky in the fire — and, in doing so, revealed that he was not simply an angel but was God in angelic form. This was such dramatic evidence {{of the nature of the}} Messenger that Manoah feared for his life, since it was said that no one could live after seeing God. However, his wife convinced him that, if God planned to slay them, he would never have revealed such things to them. In due time, their son Samson was born, and he was raised according to the provisions.|$|E

An {{estimated}} 250,000 to 375,000 attended San Francisco's Gay Freedom Day Parade; newspapers claimed the higher numbers were due to John Briggs. Organizers asked participants to carry signs indicating their hometowns for the cameras, to show how far people came to live in the Castro District. Milk rode in an open car carrying a sign saying [...] "I'm from Woodmere, N.Y." [...] He gave a version of what became his most famous speech, the [...] "Hope Speech", that The San Francisco Examiner said [...] "ignited the crowd":On this anniversary of Stonewall, I <b>ask</b> <b>my</b> gay sisters and brothers to make the commitment to fight. For themselves, for their freedom, for their country... We will not win our rights by staying quietly in our closets... We are coming out to fight the lies, the myths, the distortions.

Šešelj {{was at the time}} an anti-Communist dissident and was subsequently described for his activities in the Yugoslav Wars as [...] "a man whose killer commando units operating in Croatia and Bosnia carried on the very worst of the Chetnik tradition." [...] Later Šešelj became leader of the Serbian Radical Party, a government coalition partner of Serbian President Slobodan Milosević. In 1998, Đujić publicly stated that he regretted awarding that title to Šešelj. He was quoted as saying, [...] "I was naïve when I nominated Šešelj [...] Vojvoda; I <b>ask</b> <b>my</b> people to forgive me. The greatest gravedigger of Serbdom is Slobodan Milošević" [...] and that he is [...] "disappointed in Šešelj for openly collaborating with Milošević's Socialist Party, with Communists who have only changed their name.

2500|$|For example, if {{a person}} {{regularly}} asks his or her partner for a hug or kiss, and the partner regularly responds with a hug or kiss, the person forms a relational schema representing the predictable interaction. The schema contains information about the self (e.g., [...] "I need lots of physical affection"). It also contains information about the partner (e.g., [...] "My partner is an affectionate person"). And it contains information {{about the way the}} interaction usually unfolds, which can be summarized by an if–then statement (e.g., [...] "If I <b>ask</b> <b>my</b> partner for a hug or kiss, then my partner will respond with a hug or kiss and comfort me"). Relational schemas help guide behavior in relationships by allowing people to anticipate and plan for partner responses.|$|E

He retired after the Lakers were swept out of the playoffs in the conference semifinals by that season's eventual NBA champions, the Dallas Mavericks, meaning that he would not get a fourth three-peat (after previously achieving that feat in 1993, 1998 and 2002).

2500|$|Meanwhile, Bourguiba {{settled in}} the bourgeois {{neighborhood}} of Tourbet el Bey, in the medina of Tunis, where his brother M'hamed rented a housing on Korchani Street. Interpreter at the State section, he was often off to work or studying in the Khaldounia, aiming to prepare {{the first half of}} the French baccalaureate. This left Habib with Dhaouia, M'hamed's servant who made Habib her domestic She made him do household chores or buy groceries and took him with her whenever she went visiting families in order to select a suitable wife for M'hamed. At the start of the 1907 school year, his brother enrolled him in the Sadiki elementary school. The superintendent described him as turbulent but studious. The young Habib had to perfect Quran learnings, that being the main lessons taught. That made him spend weekends studying and learning Quran with his brother Mahmoud, shouting and screaming being Mahmoud's teaching method. [...] "To go to school", he recalled, [...] "I had to go by foot. Leaving the house where I lived and which belonged to the grandfather of Tahar Lakhdar, I crossed the souks and climbed the hill of Sidi Ben Arous. I was poorly dressed. My shoes had holes which filled with water. By pride, I refused to <b>ask</b> <b>my</b> older brother to buy me a new pair. That was my life throughout my primary education". The Husainid family members being the only ones allowed to take lunch inside the school, Bourguiba had to go home and eat Dhaouia's ratatouilles that did not put an end to his hunger. It was only during the 1911 epidemic of Cholera which killed M'hamed's wife, that he was able to eat his fill, thanks to the Couscous destined for guests, narrowly avoiding starvation.|$|E

Rove writes that while the [...] "email didn't jog any better recollection of the call", he immediately told Fitzgerald, after being sworn in, {{that he wanted to}} [...] "set the record straight."

[...] After Rove's testimony, Fitzgerald told Luskin [...] "All things being equal, we are inclined to indict your client." [...] According to Rove, Luskin and Fitzgerald meet for hours in Chicago on October 20 to discuss the matter. At some point during the meeting, [...] "Fitzgerald turned to what was really bothering him: my conversation with Matt Cooper.
