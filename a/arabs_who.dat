5|$|The Byzantine {{victory was}} {{ultimately}} a pyrrhic one, as the devastating {{impact of the}} war left the Byzantines in much weakened state. Within a few years both empires were overwhelmed by the onslaught of the <b>Arabs</b> <b>who</b> had become newly united by Islam, ultimately leading to the Muslim conquest of Persia in 644 and {{the fall of the}} Sasanian dynasty in 651.|$|E
5|$|The biblical view of {{the late}} Iron Age {{political}} and cultural map describes it {{as a set of}} branching genealogies. Biblical figures three generations forward from Terah are invariably described as the eponymous founders of different tribes and polities that interacted with the Kingdom of Judah between the 8th and 6th centuries BCE. Such is the case of the Qedarite <b>Arabs,</b> <b>who</b> according to biblical tradition, are the offspring of the Abraham-Ishmael-Kedar genealogical line.|$|E
5|$|At this point, the Muslims divided their forces: {{the bulk}} of the army, under Abbas, {{remained}} at Kamacha to continue the siege, while the remainder (an obviously exaggerated force of 50,000 according to the Zuqnin chronicler) was sent to raid further into Byzantine territory and pillage. The siege continued through the autumn, and the <b>Arabs,</b> <b>who</b> customarily did not take along many provisions, began suffering from lack of supplies. To solve their supply problems, they established a market for merchants from Mesopotamia and elsewhere. In the end, with winter approaching, Abbas was forced to raise the siege and retreat south, burning the large market-place to prevent it from falling into Byzantine hands.|$|E

5|$|Madagascar was an {{important}} transoceanic trading hub connecting ports of the Indian Ocean in the early centuries following human settlement. The written history of Madagascar began with the <b>Arabs,</b> <b>who</b> established trading posts along the northwest coast by at least the 10th century and introduced Islam, the Arabic script (used to transcribe the Malagasy language in a form of writing known as sorabe), Arab astrology, and other cultural elements. European contact began in 1500, when the Portuguese sea captain Diogo Dias sighted the island. The French established trading posts along the east coast in the late 17th century.|$|E
5|$|The giraffe {{was also}} {{known to the}} Greeks and Romans, who {{believed}} that it was an unnatural hybrid of a camel and a leopard and called it camelopardalis. The giraffe was among the many animals collected and displayed by the Romans. The first one in Rome was brought in by Julius Caesar in 46 BC and exhibited to the public. With the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the housing of giraffes in Europe declined. During the Middle Ages, giraffes were known to Europeans through contact with the <b>Arabs,</b> <b>who</b> revered the giraffe for its peculiar appearance.|$|E
5|$|Alexander the Great's {{conquest of}} the Achaemenid Empire in 332 BC {{introduced}} Hellenistic culture to the Middle East. After Alexander's death in 323 BC, his empire split among his generals and in the end, much {{of the land of}} modern-day Jordan was disputed between the Ptolemies based in Egypt and the Seleucids based in Syria. In the south and east, the Nabataeans had an independent kingdom. The Nabataeans were nomadic <b>Arabs</b> <b>who</b> derived wealth from their capital Petra, whose proximity to major trade routes led to it becoming a regional trading hub. Campaigns by different Greek generals aspiring to annex the Nabataean Kingdom were unsuccessful. The Ptolemies were eventually displaced from the region by the Seleucid Empire. The conflict between these two groups enabled the Nabataeans to extend their kingdom northwards well beyond Petra in Edom. The Nabataeans are known for their great ability in constructing efficient water collecting methods in the barren desert and their talent in carving structures into solid rocks — notably the Khazneh (treasury). These nomads spoke Arabic and wrote in Nabataean alphabets, which were developed from Aramaic script during the 2nd century BC, and are regarded by scholars to have evolved into the Arabic alphabet around the 4th century AD.|$|E

5|$|The Arab fleet under Sulayman (often {{confused}} with the Caliph himself in the medieval sources) arrived on 1 September, anchoring at first near the Hebdomon. Two days later, Sulayman led his fleet into the Bosphorus and the various squadrons began anchoring by the European and Asian suburbs of the city: one part sailed south of Chalcedon to the harbours of Eutropios and Anthemios to watch over the southern entrance of the Bosporus, {{while the rest of}} the fleet sailed into the strait, passed by Constantinople and began making landfall on the coasts between Galata and Kleidion, cutting the Byzantine capital's communication with the Black Sea. But as the Arab fleet's rearguard, twenty heavy ships with 2,000 marines, was passing the city, the southerly wind stopped and then reversed, drifting them towards the city walls, where a Byzantine squadron attacked them with Greek fire. Theophanes reported that some went down with all hands, while others, burning, sailed down to the Princes' Islands of Oxeia and Plateia. The victory encouraged the Byzantines and dejected the <b>Arabs,</b> <b>who,</b> according to Theophanes, had originally intended to sail to the sea walls during the night and try to scale them using the ships' steering paddles. The same night, Leo drew up the chain between the city and Galata, closing the entrance to the Golden Horn. The Arab fleet became reluctant to engage the Byzantines, and withdrew to the safe harbour of Sosthenion further north on the European shore of the Bosporus.|$|E

25|$|The {{argument}} that Arab immigration somehow {{made up a}} large part of the Palestinian Arab population is thus statistically untenable.
