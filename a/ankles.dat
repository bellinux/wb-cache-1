5|$|Heinrich Mallison from Berlin's Museum of Natural History also {{presented}} a theory in 2011, suggesting that Tyrannosaurus {{and many other}} dinosaurs may have achieved relatively high speeds through short rapid strides instead of the long strides employed by modern birds and mammals when running, likening their movement to power-walking. This, according to Mallison, would have been achievable irrespective of joint strength and lessened {{the need for additional}} muscle mass in the legs, particularly at the <b>ankles.</b> To support his theory, Mallison assessed the limbs of various dinosaurs and found that they were different from those of modern mammals and birds; having their stride length greatly limited by their skeletons, but also having relatively large muscles at the hindquarters. He found a few similarities between the muscles in dinosaurs and race-walkers; having less muscle mass in the <b>ankles</b> but more at the hindquarters. John Hutchinson advised caution regarding this theory, suggesting that they must first look into dinosaur muscles to see how frequently they could have contracted.|$|E

5|$|Non-disabled sprinters have {{calves and}} <b>ankles</b> that return and amplify the energy {{supplied}} by their hips and knees, while Pistorius compensates with additional work {{because he does}} not have calves and <b>ankles</b> with their associated tendons and muscles. An analysis published by Engineering & Technology magazine estimates that in using the blades, Pistorius must generate twice the power from his gluteal and quadriceps muscles that a normal sprinter would. Other sources also credit core abdominal muscles and a faster arm swing. His trainer estimates that about 85 percent of his power comes from his hips and the rest from his knees. This results in a gait that waddles slightly, as Pistorius swings his upper body to balance the springing action of the blades. The blades compress under his weight, then release as he moves forward, providing forward thrust from the tips as they return to their molded shape. As they spring off, he swings them slightly out to the side and throws them forward for the next stride.|$|E

50|$|A high <b>ankle</b> sprain, {{also known}} as a syndesmotic sprain, is a sprain of the syndesmotic ligaments that connect the tibia and fibula in the lower leg, thereby {{creating}} a mortise and tenon joint for the <b>ankle.</b> High <b>ankle</b> sprains are described as high because they are located above the <b>ankle.</b> They comprise approximately 15% of all <b>ankle</b> sprains. Unlike the common lateral <b>ankle</b> sprains, when ligaments around the <b>ankle</b> are injured through an inward twisting, high <b>ankle</b> sprains are caused when the lower leg and foot externally rotates (twists out).|$|R

40|$|Objectives: <b>Ankle</b> {{injuries}} {{account for}} {{the highest percentage of}} injuries in netball, yet the chronic nature of <b>ankle</b> sprains is under reported within this population group. Chronic <b>ankle</b> instability (CAI) is a term used to describe certain insufficiencies that persist after an acute <b>ankle</b> sprain. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate recurrent sprain, perceived <b>ankle</b> instability and mechanical <b>ankle</b> instability in a cohort of netball players. Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Ninety-six female netball players (24. 1 ± 7. 9 years) were recruited (42 club players and 54 inter-district players). Recurrent sprain was defined as two or more lifetime sprains to the same <b>ankle.</b> Perceived <b>ankle</b> instability was quantified with the Cumberland <b>Ankle</b> Instability Tool - Youth. Mechanical <b>ankle</b> instability was quantified via inversion-eversion rotations using an <b>ankle</b> arthrometer at torques of 3 Newton-metres. Results: Forty-seven percent of the cohort had recurrently sprained an <b>ankle.</b> Of the 69 players with a previously sprained <b>ankle,</b> 64 % had a moderate-severe degree of perceived <b>ankle</b> instability. The total inversion-eversion angle was 31. 1 ± 8. 7 degrees. Club players had more cases of moderate-severe perceived <b>ankle</b> instability (p = 0. 01) and larger inversion-eversion angles (p = 0. 001) compared to inter-district players. Conclusions: Recurrent <b>ankle</b> sprain and perceived <b>ankle</b> instability are easily identifiable aspects of CAI shown to be prevalent within this cohort. Additional research is required to quantify a cut-off value for mechanical instability. Club netball players were found to have more counts of moderate-severe perceived <b>ankle</b> instability and larger inversion-eversion angles when compared to the inter-district netball players...|$|R
40|$|<b>Ankle</b> injuries, {{especially}} <b>ankle</b> sprains, are {{a common}} problem in sports and medical care. <b>Ankle</b> sprains result in pain and absenteeism from work and/or sports participation, {{and can lead to}} physical restrictions such as <b>ankle</b> instability.

A computerized literature search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Clinical Trial Register. This review includes randomized controlled trials in English, German and Dutch, published between 1990 and April 2009 that compared <b>ankle</b> braces as a treatment for lateral <b>ankle</b> sprains with other functional treatments. The inclusion criteria for this systematic review were (i) individuals (sports participants as well as non-sports participants) with an acute injury of the <b>ankle</b> (acute <b>ankle</b> sprains); (ii) use of an <b>ankle</b> brace as primary treatment for acute <b>ankle</b> sprains; (iii) control interventions including any other type of functional treatment (e. g. Tubigrip (TM), elastic wrap or <b>ankle</b> tape); and (iv) one of the following reported outcome measures: re-injuries, symptoms (pain, swelling, instability), functional outcomes and/or time to resumption of sports, daily activities and/or work. Eight studies met all inclusion criteria. Differences in outcome measures, intervention types and patient characteristics precluded pooling of the results, so best evidence syntheses were conducted. A few individual studies reported positive outcomes after treatment with an <b>ankle</b> brace compared with other functional methods, but our best evidence syntheses only demonstrated a better treatment result in terms of functional outcome. Other studies have suggested that <b>ankle</b> brace treatment is a more cost-effective method, so the use of braces after acute <b>ankle</b> sprains should be considered. Further research should focus on economic evaluation and on different types of <b>ankle</b> brace, to examine the strengths and weaknesses of <b>ankle</b> braces for the treatment of acute <b>ankle</b> sprain...|$|R

40|$|Background: End-stage <b>ankle</b> {{arthritis}} impairs joint {{function and}} patients' mobility. Total <b>ankle</b> replacement is a surgical procedure to treat severe <b>ankle</b> arthritis. Salto Talaris Anatomic AnkleTM (STAA) {{was designed to}} mimic the normal <b>ankle</b> anatomy and flexion/extension of the <b>ankle</b> movement. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the effect of an STAA <b>ankle</b> replacement on <b>ankle</b> joint function and mechanics during gait. Methods: Five patients with end-stage unilateral <b>ankle</b> arthritis were recruited. Patients performed level walking in a laboratory setting on 2 occasions, prior to and 3 months after the STAA <b>ankle</b> surgeries. American Orthopedic Foot and <b>Ankle</b> Society (AOFAS) hindfoot score was obtained. A 12 -camera motion capture system was used to perform walking analysis. Gait temporo-spatial parameters and <b>ankle</b> joint mechanics were evaluated. Paired Student's t tests and non-parametric Wilcoxon matched tests were performed to examine the differences in biomechanical variables between the pre- and post-surgery walking conditions. Results: Compared to the pre-surgical condition, at 3 months of post-STAA surgery, patients experienced greater improvement in AOFAS hindfoot score (p[*]=[*] 0. 0001); the STAA <b>ankle</b> demonstrated a 31 % increase in <b>ankle</b> joint excursion (p[*]=[*] 0. 045), a 22 % increase in <b>ankle</b> plantarflexor moment (p[*]=[*] 0. 075), a 60 % increase in <b>ankle</b> power absorption (p[*]=[*] 0. 023), and a 68 % increase in <b>ankle</b> power production (p[*]=[*] 0. 039).

A search strategy was developed, using the keywords, <b>ankle</b> supports, <b>ankle</b> brace, <b>ankle</b> tapes, <b>ankle</b> sprains and athletes, to identify available literature in the databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, etc.), libraries and unpublished papers. Trials which consider adolescents and adults, elite and recreational players as participants were the study of choice. External <b>ankle</b> supports comprise <b>ankle</b> tape, brace or orthosis applied to the <b>ankle</b> to prevent <b>ankle</b> sprains.
