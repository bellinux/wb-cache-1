40|$|Abstract. The {{silicon steel}} was cold rolled {{by using an}} oil-in-water {{emulsion}} for lubricating its surfaces. Oil in water (O/W) emulsion is a lubricant composed {{of oil in the}} form of droplets suspended in water. This paper mainly researched on the new emulsion which was prepared by changing the compound proportion between antioxidant 2, 6 -Di-tert-butyl-p-cresol (T 501) and <b>antirust</b> agent petroleum sodium sulfonate (T 702). The corrosion behavior of the emulsion was investigated by weight loss and electrochemical methods. The mechanisms for inhibition of corrosion synergism between T 501 and T 702 in base oil were studied. The results show that the <b>antirust</b> agent (T 702) can effectively forming a layer of adsorption film on the rolled strip surface and this adsorption film can segregate strip surface from air and water. The antioxidant (T 501) can capture oxygenic free radical (•OH, RO•, ROO•) and carbon free radical and reduces the trend which emulsion occur oxidation reaction under high temperature and high pressure. The antioxidant plays a minor role in inhibition of corrosion synergism. The results show that the best compound proportion content is 4 % antioxidant (T 501) and 8 % <b>antirust</b> agent (T 702), which can effectively increase the anticorrosion effect of emulsion.

30|$|Cutting fluid {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the manufacturing industry as lubricant [8]. It can be mainly classified into two categories: oil-based and water-based cutting fluid. The primary functions of cutting fluid include lubrication, cooling, cleaning, and <b>antirust.</b> At present, the lubrication performance of oil-based cutting fluid is outstanding, but its cooling property is inferior. On the contrary, water-based cutting fluid shows powerful ability in cooling, cleaning, and <b>antirust,</b> but it is relatively weak in lubrication [9]. Nowadays, increasingly strict environmental regulations result in higher operating costs for metal cutting. Water-based cutting fluid is utilized more and more popularly, owing to its low-cost and less-waste emissions than oil-based cutting fluid [10]. However, the water-based cutting fluid is not ideal due to its inferior lubrication ability [8]. Consequently, it is necessary to find a way to enhance the lubrication property of water-based cutting fluid. Up to now, a great deal of research has been done on this subject [9 – 11]. One simple approach is putting additives into regular lubricants to reduce friction and wear, which has been widely applied in lubrication engineering [2].|$|E

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} (RC) structures {{must maintain}} sufficient proof strength and durability and achieve required performance throughout their service life. When constructing an RC structure in limited construction space, {{it is often}} constructed in sections (constructed in separate periods of time). Such a structure has construction joints (Fig. 1), and cracks may occur at or near those joints and cause water penetration. In this way, air and water easily penetrate construction joints with cracks and create an environment where rebar easily becomes corroded, likely causing adverse effects on proof strength and durability of the RC structure. That greatly affects maintenance of the RC structure too. Thus, {{on the assumption that}} prevention of corrosion of rebars at such joints could alleviate the issue of long-term durability that greatly affects maintenance of RC structures, we carried out accelerated corrosion tests of rebars using rebars samples that had rebars and different types of existing <b>antirust</b> agent.

The most attractive advantages of phytic acid include its low-cost and availability as a typically polyphosphorylated carbohydrate [Fig. S 1 (supporting data)] is widely found in beans, brown rice, corn, sesame seeds, and wheat bran. Phytic acid is used as cleaning agent, water treatment agent, food additives and cosmetic additive, and has been proved that it is non-toxic to human and “green” to environment [16]. Due to its structure which is containing 12 acid groups, phytic acid and its salts are liable to interact with metal ions to form complexes on the metal surface, acting as <b>antirust</b> and anticorrosive [17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. The reaction between active groups of PA and metal ions forms chelate complex compounds, which can deposit on the surface of a metal substrate, and thus improve the corrosion resistance. The literature survey showed that, there are not any data on corrosion behavior of Pb–In alloy in HCl solution. Also, the literature reveals that phytic acid has not almost yet been used as corrosion inhibitor of Pb and its investigated alloys. So, the aim of the present work was to investigate the effect of phytic acid as a green inhibitor on the corrosion behavior of Pb and Pb–In alloys in HCl solution at different temperatures. Corrosion inhibition of Pb and Pb–In alloys in HCl solution in the presence of PA has been studied by potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques complemented with some SEM and EDX observations. The mechanism of inhibition is discussed on the basis of an adsorption isotherm, as well as, the calculated thermodynamic parameters.|$|E
40|$|Based on unique data characterizing private cartel {{behavior}} {{since the}} 1770 s, this dissertation presents an empirical analysis of four measures of success of overt collusive conduct: overcharges, stability, duration, and a multidimensional index of cartel success. Factors hypothesized {{to contribute to}} success include market structure, internal organization, and legal environment. The results of this research make important contributions to cartel studies and the design of antitrust policies. ^ Empirical findings suggest that markets characterized by {{a high degree of}} seller concentration provide a more favorable environment for cartel success than less concentrated markets. Overcharges attained in concentrated markets are higher, and cartels are more stable. The firms 2 ̆ 7 size inequality within the cartel is negatively related to cartel success. ^ There is mixed evidence about the impact of changes in the <b>antirust</b> law environment on cartel success. First, antitrust enforcement appears to be directed at cartels that attain lower overcharges rather than cartels that achieve higher overcharges. Second, stricter antitrust regulations tend to target cartel overcharges to a higher extent than they target cartel duration. Although cartel overcharges tend to decline over time, the duration of cartel agreements tends to increase over time. The multidimensional index of cartel success tends to increase over time, suggesting that cartels have become more successful as antitrust laws become stricter. However, there is also evidence that antitrust enforcement since 1990 has been the most effective. The overcharges are the lowest during this period. ^ This research shows that overcharges tend to be lower in the countries with the most mature antitrust systems. Empirical findings suggest that current antitrust policy presumptions about the average gain from price-fixing are likely to be too low. Therefore, fines calculated based on these presumptions typically result in sub-optimal deterrence. ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the main difficulties}} surrounding private enforcement of antitrust law in Poland, currently the key implementation problem {{in the field of}} antitrust law. Whereas the basic standards concerning the public pillar of antitrust enforcement have already been established, either in the European Community (EC) or in its Member States, the private pillar of antitrust enforcement has not yet been fully developed. The fact that private enforcement of antitrust law is possible, and in fact equal, to public enforcement is not yet commonly recognized. In response to the European Commission’s White Paper on Damages actions for breach of the EC antitrust rules, private enforcement of <b>antirust</b> law is presently under intense discussion in EC Member States. This article should be considered as one of the contributions to this debate. It presents the main legal framework of private enforcement of antitrust law in Poland. In order to do so, it directly refers to the Polish Act on competition and consumer protection, the Civil Code and the Civil Procedure Code. This article also discusses Polish case law in this area. It aims to assess whether existing Polish legal provisions are, in fact, sufficient to ensure effective private enforcement of Polish as well as EC antitrust law. The article refers to the main proposals of the European Commission’s White Paper. It is concluded that private enforcement of antitrust law is indeed possible in Poland on the basis of currently applicable procedural rules, even if there are no special instruments designed to facilitate it. However, it cannot be expect that in the current legal climate, private parties will eagerly and frequently apply for damages in cases of a breach of Polish antitrust law. Antitrust cases are special in many aspects and, thus, they require specific solutions in procedural terms. This article aims to pinpoint those areas, where the Polish law needs to be changed in order to develop and promote private enforcement of antitrust law in Poland. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{period from}} 1870 - 1920 {{was a turning}} point in modern history. It was during this time that the {{contours}} of the modern industrial state were formed. A “Great Merger Movement” occurred {{right in the middle of}} this period across most of the industrialized nations of the world. The trend toward industrial concentration, which was known at the time as the “trust problem,” generated considerable public alarm. Some have argued that it was caused by antitrust policy and the Supreme Court’s early antitrust decisions. Indeed, the idea has become the conventional wisdom among some antitrust scholars, especially those connected with the law and economics movement, and it has contributed to a growing skepticism about the efficacy of antitrust law more generally. This article analyzes the development of the Supreme Court’s antitrust jurisprudence from E. C. Knight through Swift and attempts to offer a more balanced overview of the interplay between the economic transformation that occurred around the turn of the twentieth century and the formative developments in American <b>antirust</b> law. From this perspective, both the merger movement and the Supreme Court’s early antitrust decisions were responses to the same underlying economic forces. There is little, if any, reason to believe that the Supreme Court’s decisions actually caused the Great Merger Movement. In fact, the Court’s decisions were considerably more coherent than some scholars have recognized. One of the unfortunate consequences of all the attention that has been devoted to the effect of the Supreme Court’s decisions on industrial concentration is that it has distracted attention from the role that the decisions played in the development of constitutional doctrine. The economic forces that created the trust problem also compelled the Supreme Court to extend the scope of federal commerce powers and bring a wide range of new business activities within the reach of federal regulations.

No Estado do CearÃ este problema se acentua, {{principal}}mente devido a necessidade de importar milho e soja de outros estados e paÃses (no caso do milho) e da oscilaÃÃo sazonal nos preÃos desses ingredientes. Na tentativa de reduzir os custos, tem se procurado utilizar alimentos âalternativosâ, como o farelo de castanha de caju (FCC) e o farelo de coco (FC) na formulaÃÃo de raÃÃes para aves. Em geral, estes farelos sÃo ricos em lipÃdios e estÃo propensos a desenvolverem rancidez oxidativa, principal responsÃvel pelas perdas de qualidade dos alimentos. Para evitar a peroxidaÃÃo lipÃdica Ã comum tratar ingredientes ou raÃÃes com antioxidante durante o armazenamento. O presente trabalho teve como objetivos avaliar a estabilidade oxidativa do FCC e do FC, tratados ou nÃo com BHT (Butil hidroxitolueno) em diferentes tempos de armazenamento, e os efeitos da utilizaÃÃo destes ingredientes nas raÃÃes sobre o desempenho zootÃcnico de frangos de corte e de poedeiras comerciais, respectivamente. Para cada ingrediente, a quantidade adquirida foi dividida em cinco partes iguais. No dia zero (logo apÃs o beneficiamento), uma das partes foi tratada com BHT, na proporÃÃo de 500 ppm, enquanto outra permaneceu sem a adiÃÃo de antioxidante atÃ o final de 35 dias de armazenamento. Nas demais porÃÃes o BHT foi adicionado aos 7, 14 e 21 dias. Semanalmente, foram determinados os Ãndices de acidez (IA) e de perÃxidos (IP). Decorrido o perÃodo de armazenamento, o FCC e o FC foram utilizados na formulaÃÃo das raÃÃes para frangos de corte (Experimento 1 com FCC) e para poedeiras comerciais (Experimento 2 com FC). No experimento 1 foram utilizados 480 pintos de um dia, Ross, distribuÃdos ao acaso em cinco tratamentos, com oito repetiÃÃes de doze aves cada. Os tratamentos constaram de raÃÃes isonutrientes contendo: FCC sem adiÃÃo de BHT (s/BHT); FCC com adiÃÃo de BHT no dia zero (BHT/ 0); FCC com adiÃÃo de BHT 7 dias apÃs o armazenamento (BHT/ 7); FCC com adiÃÃo de BHT 14 dias apÃs o armazenamento (BHT/ 14); FCC com adiÃÃo de BHT 21 dias apÃs o armazenamento (BHT/ 21). O IA do FCC durante o perÃodo de armazenamento nÃo variou, independente do uso ou nÃo de antioxidante, enquanto que, o IP do FCC com ou sem BHT aumentou com o tempo de armazenamento. Os tratamentos nÃo afetaram o desempenho (consumo de raÃÃo, ganho de peso e conversÃo alimentar), as caracterÃsticas de carcaÃa (rendimento de carcaÃa e de peito e, percentagem de fÃgado e gordura abdominal) o teor de umidade do fÃgado e o teor de umidade e extrato etÃreo da gordura abdominal dos frangos de corte. Os parÃmetros de qualidade da carne (perdas por cocÃÃo, capacidade de retenÃÃo de Ãgua, forÃa de cisalhamento e pH) e os componentes de cor luminosidade (L*) e intensidade de vermelho (a*) da gordura nÃo diferiram entre si. Entretanto, no grupo das aves que receberam FCC tratado com BHT/ 0 o teor de extrato etÃreo do fÃgado foi menor e a intensidade de amarelo (componente b*) da gordura abdominal foi maior quando comparado com o das aves do tratamento controle. No experimento 2, foram utilizadas 180 poedeiras Hisex brancas, no segundo ciclo de produÃÃo, distribuÃdas ao acaso em cinco tratamentos e seis repetiÃÃes de seis aves cada. Os tratamentos consistiram de raÃÃes isonutrientes contendo: FC sem adiÃÃo de BHT (s/BHT); FC com adiÃÃo de BHT no dia zero (BHT/ 0); FC com adiÃÃo de BHT 7 dias apÃs o armazenamento (BHT/ 7); FC com adiÃÃo de BHT 14 dias apÃs o armazenamento (BHT/ 14); FC com adiÃÃo de BHT 21 dias apÃs o armazenamento (BHT/ 21). O IA e IP do FC armazenado com ou sem BHT, aumentaram com o tempo de armazenamento. O nÃvel de oxidaÃÃo observado no FC e, consequentemente, nas raÃÃes, nÃo afetou o desempenho produtivo (consumo de raÃÃo, percentagem de postura, massa de ovo e conversÃo alimentar) e a qualidade dos ovos (peso do ovo, Unidades Haugh, percentagem de gema, casca e albÃmen, e cor da gema). O FCC e o FC armazenados por 35 dias sem antioxidante podem compor as raÃÃes de frangos de corte e poedeiras, respectivamente, sem prejudicar o desempenho produtivo e a qualidade da carne e dos ovos. Entretanto, frangos de corte alimentados com raÃÃo contendo 15 % de FCC tratado com BHT/ 0 apresentam menor teor de extrato etÃreo no fÃgado e maior intensidade de amarelo na gordura abdominalFeeding {{is one of}} {{the item}} that more the economic exploration of birds burdens. In the State of the CearÃ this problem if accents, mainly due the necessity to import maize and soy of other states and countries (in the case of the maize) and of the sazonal oscillation in the prices of these ingredients. In the attempt to reduce the costs, if it has looked for to use âalternativeâ foods, as the cashew chestnut bran (FCC) and the bran of coconut (FC) in the formularization of rations for birds. In general, these brans are rich in lipÃdios and are inclined to develop oxidativa, main rancidez responsible for the losses of quality of foods. To prevent the lipÃdica peroxidaÃÃo it is common to treat ingredients or rations with <b>antirust</b> substance during the storage. The present work had as objective to evaluate the oxidativa stability of the FCC and the FC, dealt or not with BHT (hidroxitolueno Butil) in different times of storage, and the effect of the use of these ingredients in the rations on the zootÃcnico performance of chickens of cut and commercial poedeiras, respectively. For each ingredient, the acquired amount was divided in five equal parts. In day zero (soon after the improvement), one of the parts was dealt with BHT, in the ratio of 500 ppm, while another one remained without the <b>antirust</b> substance addition until the end of 35 days of storage. In the too much portions the BHT was added to the 7, 14 and 21 days. Weekly, the peroxide and acid values had been determined (WENT) (IP). Passed the period of storage, the FCC and the FC had been used in the formularization of the rations for chickens of cut (Experiment 1 with FCC) and for commercial poedeiras (Experiment 2 with FC). In experiment 1 480 young chickens of one day had been used, Ross, distributed to perhaps in five treatments, with eight repetitions of twelve birds each. The treatments had consisted of isonutrientes rations contend: FCC without BHT addition (s/BHT); FCC with addition of BHT in day zero (BHT/ 0); FCC with BHT addition 7 days after the storage (BHT/ 7); FCC with BHT addition 14 days after the storage (BHT/ 14); FCC with BHT addition 21 days after the storage (BHT/ 21). IT WENT IT of the FCC during the period of storage did not vary, independent of the use or not of <b>antirust</b> substance, whereas, the IP of the FCC with or without BHT increased with the storage time. The treatments had not affected the performance (consumption of ration, profit of weight and alimentary conversion), the characteristics of carcass (chest and carcass income and, percentage of liver and abdominal fat) the text of humidity of the liver and the text of humidity and etÃreo extract of the abdominal fat of the cut chickens. The parameters of quality of the meat (losses for firing, capacity of water retention, force of shear and pH) and the components of color luminosity (L*) and intensity of red (a*) of the fat had not differed between itself. However, in the group of the birds that had received FCC dealt with BHT/ 0 the etÃreo extract text of the liver was lesser and the yellow intensity (component b*) of the abdominal fat was bigger when compared with the one of the birds of the treatment it has controlled. In experiment 2, 180 white poedeiras Hisex had been used, in as the cycle of production, distributed to perhaps in five treatments and six repetitions of six birds each. The treatments had consisted of isonutrientes rations contend: FC without BHT addition (s/BHT); FC with addition of BHT in day zero (BHT/ 0); FC with BHT addition 7 days after the storage (BHT/ 7); FC with BHT addition 14 days after the storage (BHT/ 14); FC with BHT addition 21 days after the storage (BHT/ 21). IT WENT IT and IP of the FC stored with or without BHT, had increased with the storage time. The level of oxidation observed in the FC and, consequentemente, in the rations, did not affect the productive performance (consumption of ration, percentage of position, egg mass and alimentary conversion) and the quality of eggs (weight of the egg, Haugh Units, egg yolk percentage, rind and albÃmen, and color of the egg yolk). The FCC and the FC stored per 35 days without <b>antirust</b> substance can compose the rations of cut chickens and poedeiras, respectively, without harming the productive performance {{and the quality of the}} meat and eggs. However, fed chickens of cut with ration I contend 15 % of FCC dealt with BHT/ 0 present minor text of etÃreo extract in the liver and greater yellow intensity in the abdominal fa...|$|E
