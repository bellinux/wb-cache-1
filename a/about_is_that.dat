25|$|Psychology {{has much}} to discuss about pseudoscience thinking, {{as it is the}} illusory {{perceptions}} of causality and effectiveness of numerous individuals that needs to be illuminated. Research suggests that illusionary thinking happens in most people when exposed to certain circumstances such as reading a book, an advertisement or the testimony of others are the basis of pseudoscience beliefs. It is assumed that illusions are not unusual, and given the right conditions, illusions are able to occur systematically even in normal emotional situations. One of the things pseudoscience believers quibble most <b>about</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> academic science usually treats them as fools. Minimizing these illusions in the real world is not simple. To this aim, designing evidence-based educational programs can be effective to help people identify and reduce their own illusions.|$|E

Opponents to the turnpike cited detrimental effects to their community and to the environment as their concerns.

500|$|With his {{contract}} expiring in the off-season, Teemu Selänne, who had since {{returned to the}} Ducks, was reportedly in talks with team management to sign Kariya. On August 27, 2010, however, {{on the advice of}} doctors who refused to clear him to play, Kariya announced that he would sit out the 2010–11 season with post-concussion syndrome. While the symptoms eventually did subside somewhat, the same doctors advised Kariya that it was too risky to try to play again, and Kariya officially announced his retirement from hockey on June 29, 2011, through the NHLPA. He continued to be outspoken regarding the prevalence of concussions among hockey players; {{in an interview with the}} Globe and Mail, he commented, [...] "The thing I worry <b>about</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> you'll get a guy who is playing with a concussion, and he gets hit, and he dies at centre ice." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{resistance}} to the character, Bungie staff defended the character's introduction. [...] "I'd much rather experiment and do something surprising, and not have everybody appreciate it, than just turn the crank and do another alien war movie with a space marine," [...] said Halo 2 design lead Jaime Griesemer. Community lead Brian Jarrard attributed some of the fan backlash to a discord between the game's marketing and the actual gameplay. [...] "I think, {{even more so than}} playing as the Arbiter, the thing that people were disappointed with and angry <b>about</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they were promised this experience, through the marketing, of being really backs against the wall, Earth's under siege, we're going to do all we can to save our home planet... In reality, the game only had two missions that actually did that." [...] Referring to Halo 2s cliffhanger ending, Griesemer said, [...] "I think if we'd been able to finish that last couple of missions and get you properly back on Earth, a lot of the reaction would have been placated." ...|$|E
