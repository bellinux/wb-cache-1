5|$|Different {{branches}} of Taoism often have differing pantheons of lesser deities, where these deities reflect different notions of cosmology. Lesser deities <b>also</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> promoted or demoted for their activity. Some varieties of popular Chinese religion incorporate the Jade Emperor, {{derived from the}} main of the Three Purities, as {{a representation of the}} most high God.|$|E
5|$|Prosody is {{the study}} of the meter, rhythm, and {{intonation}} of a poem. Rhythm and meter are different, although closely related. Meter is the definitive pattern established for a verse (such as iambic pentameter), while rhythm is the actual sound that results from a line of poetry. Prosody <b>also</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> used more specifically to refer to the scanning of poetic lines to show meter.|$|E
5|$|Species that {{do need to}} swim {{continuously}} {{to breathe}} go through {{a process known as}} sleep swimming, in which the shark is essentially unconscious. It is known from experiments conducted on the spiny dogfish that its spinal cord, rather than its brain, coordinates swimming, so spiny dogfish can continue to swim while sleeping, and this <b>also</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> the case in larger shark species.|$|E

5|$|Today, shetland sheep {{are mainly}} {{kept in the}} Shetland isles {{and a handful of}} other locales. This is because of their ability to survive on {{infertile}} land that would otherwise be agriculturally useless. Their good-natured temperament is also a major attraction in keeping Shetland sheep. They are most commonly farmed for their prized wool, but they <b>also</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> kept for their meat.|$|E
5|$|Applesauce cake is {{a dessert}} cake {{prepared}} using apple sauce, flour and sugar as main ingredients. Store-bought or homemade applesauce {{may be used}} in its preparation. Additional ingredients include eggs, butter, margarine or oil, raisins and plumped raisins, dates, chopped apple, chopped nuts (such as walnuts and pecans), cocoa powder, and spices such as cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and allspice. Some versions include dried or fresh, finely grated ginger. After baking, applesauce cake is sometimes topped with an icing, frosting or glaze, such as a caramel glaze. It <b>also</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> served topped with a dusting of confectioner's sugar or whipped cream. Gluten-free applesauce cake can be prepared using rice flour.|$|E
5|$|Pro-{{feminism}} is {{the support}} of feminism without implying that the supporter {{is a member of}} the feminist movement. The term is most often used in reference to men who are actively supportive of feminism. The activities of pro-feminist men's groups include anti-violence work with boys and young men in schools, offering sexual harassment workshops in workplaces, running community education campaigns, and counselling male perpetrators of violence. Pro-feminist men <b>also</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> involved in men's health, activism against pornography including anti-pornography legislation, men's studies, and the development of gender equity curricula in schools. This work is sometimes in collaboration with feminists and women's services, such as domestic violence and rape crisis centres.|$|E

5|$|Regardless of the {{political}} relationship between Æthelberht and the Franks, there is abundant evidence of strong connections across the English Channel. There was a luxury trade between Kent and the Franks, and burial artefacts found include clothing, drink, and weapons that reflect Frankish cultural influence. The Kentish burials have a greater range of imported goods {{than those of the}} neighbouring Anglo-Saxon regions, which is not surprising given Kent's easier access to trade across the English Channel. In addition, the grave goods are both richer and more numerous in Kentish graves, implying that material wealth was derived from that trade. Frankish influences <b>also</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> detected in the social and agrarian organization of Kent. Other cultural influences may be seen in the burials as well, so {{it is not necessary to}} presume that there was direct settlement by the Franks in Kent.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the frieze may be sought in the Attic relief {{sculpture}} of the late fifth century; this resonance <b>also</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> discovered to some degree in the public works of the Hephaisteion frieze and the Nike Athena balustrade, where the imagery of the seated deities and the sandal-binder respectively, likely owes a debt to the Parthenon. There also are traces found on the private commissions of grave stelae from the period, for example, the “cat stele” from Aegina bears a distinct similarity to figures N135–6. As does the Hermes of the four-figure relief known from a Roman copy. Later classicizing art of the Hellenistic and Roman eras also looked to the frieze for inspiration as attested by the Lycian Sarcophagus of Sidon, Phoenicia, the Ara Pacis Augustae, the Gemma Augustea, and many pieces of the Hadrianic generation.|$|E

25|$|Injuries {{generally}} are classified by either severity, {{the location of}} damage, {{or a combination of}} both. Trauma <b>also</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> classified by demographic group, such as age or gender. It <b>also</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> classified by the type of force applied to the body, such as blunt trauma or penetrating trauma. For research purposes injury may be classified using the Barell matrix, which is based on ICD-9-CM. The purpose of the matrix is for international standardization of the classification of trauma. Major trauma sometimes is classified by body area; injuries affecting 40% are polytrauma, 30% head injuries, 20% chest trauma, 10%, abdominal trauma, and 2%, extremity trauma.|$|E

25|$|For {{statistical}} purposes, {{injuries are}} classified as either intentional such as suicide, or unintentional, such as a motor vehicle collision. Intentional injury is a common cause of traumas. Penetrating trauma is caused when a foreign body such as a bullet or a knife enters the body tissue, creating an open wound. In the United States, most deaths caused by penetrating trauma occur in urban areas and 80% of these deaths are caused by firearms. Blast injury is a complex cause of trauma because it commonly includes both blunt and penetrating trauma, and <b>also</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> accompanied by a burn injury. Trauma <b>also</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> associated with a particular activity, such as an occupational or sports injury.|$|E
