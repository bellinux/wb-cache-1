500|$|On {{his return}} to St. James's Palace, Churchill's {{attention}} was drawn towards other matters, and to a fresh face at court. [...] "I beg you will let me see you <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can", pleaded Churchill {{in a letter to}} Sarah Jennings, [...] "which I am sure you ought to do if you care for my love..." [...] Sarah Jennings' social origins were in many ways similar to Churchill's – minor gentry blighted by debt-induced poverty. After her father's death when she was eight, Sarah, together with her mother and sisters, moved to London. As Royalist supporters (despite the fact that Sarah's great uncle, James Temple, was convicted of regicide), the Jennings' loyalty to the crown, like the Churchill's, was repaid with court employment, and in 1673 Sarah followed her sister Frances into the household of the Duchess of York, Mary of Modena, second wife to James, Duke of York.|$|E
500|$|Some {{reception}} of the film, however, was much more positive, in particular by reviewers for horror outlets. Michael Gingold of Fangoria gave it two-and-half out of four skulls, while Jonathan Barkan of Bloody Disgusting gave it {{four out of five}} skulls, stating it [...] "isn’t a movie meant to scare or make you think but {{it is one of the}} most entertaining and enjoyable movies of its kind that I’ve seen in years." [...] Scott Weinberg of FEARnet wrote that [...] "aside from some very clunky editorial missteps in the film's second half, there's a good deal of wit, enthusiasm, energy, and amusing attitude to be found in the dumb-yet-self-aware Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," [...] all while noting that he is [...] "not the type to act snobbish around a ridiculous film that obviously knows it's ridiculous." [...] According to Ryan Larson of Shock Till You Drop, the film [...] "is a mixed bag" [...] but [...] "fortunately, the lows don’t appear <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> would think," [...] and, [...] "if taken at face value, Hansel & Gretel is well worth the view." [...] William Bibbiani of CraveOnline, who criticized the film's inadequately [...] "limp" [...] marketing campaign, found the movie itself [...] "inherently stupid" [...] but in a good way, [...] "played with humor, ultraviolence and anachronistic fetish." [...] Cinema Blend's Sean O'Connell stated that the film is [...] "often mean and nasty, but that's really its saving grace." [...] Peter Paras of E! recommended this [...] "super violent, pretty funny flick" [...] for how it [...] "revels in the mayhem". Tom Russo of The Boston Globe, giving the film three out of five stars, called it a [...] "splattery fanboy fun. Preposterous, clearly, but fun." [...] Jonathon Natsis of Filmink wrote: [...] "Hansel and Gretel is not a 'film'. It's a 'movie', in all its unabashed, excitable glory...big on blood-soaked entertainment and low on pretension." [...] Rick Florino of Artistdirect gave it four out of five stars, stating: [...] "This has all the elements of a classic action flick, and it's destined for cult status. Welcome to the most fun movie of 2013." [...] DVD Talk's Jamie S. Rich summed up: [...] "Is Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters a good movie? Probably not. At least not in any way that is defensible by regular critical standards. Is it a hell of a good time? Absolutely so. Unabashedly so. That's all it wants to be." ...|$|E

He did not tell the Countess of Southdown what opinion his aunt had formed of her Ladyship, who, on the contrary, thought that she had made a most {{delightful}} and majestic impression on Miss Crawley.|$|R
2500|$|In his First Epistle to the Corinthians (c. 54–55), Paul the Apostle {{gives the}} {{earliest}} recorded description of Jesus' Last Supper: [...] "The Lord Jesus {{on the night}} when he was betrayed took bread, {{and when he had}} given thanks, he broke it, and said, 'This is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.' In the same way also the cup, after supper, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood.

2500|$|When {{interviewed by}} FourFourTwo magazine, McManaman stated, [...] "I think I {{probably}} least enjoyed my time when Glenn Hoddle was the manager. But I wouldn't {{say he was}} necessarily the worst. He had his ways of training and ways of acting and all managers have different ways of doing things; it's the same with club managers. Sometimes when you join up with England and you don't play <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> did under a certain other manager – then you'll think it's terrible. I loved going to play with England. For instance, I did {{get to go to}} the World Cup even though I only played for 17 minutes. That kind of experience leaves an indelible mark on your mind. So I don't really think of it in terms of [...] "worst"; but going to the World Cup and not playing much was a big thing for me, really, and that was under Glenn, of course." [...] Hoddle also notably arranged for McManaman to meet a disabled fan (and thus fulfill his lifelong wish of meeting McManaman) while the fan {{was on the verge of}} death, in 1997, to great media acclaim, though the story only broke a year after Hoddle had been sacked from the England job for alleged disparaging comments about disabled people.|$|E

5000|$|As {{much as we}} like {{to think}} that we are independent-minded, free-willed, {{autonomous}} individuals, the fact remains that some part of us is still susceptible to programming.Programming can happen to anyone. Intelligence, education, common sense, belief, or convictions offer little protection. All it takes is repetition (the slow route) or vulnerability (the fast route) and, eventually, we're hooked. Master programmers - from cult leaders to cigarette companies to government agencies - do both, <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> possible, whether <b>you</b> like it or not.Ironically, the more immune to programming you think you are, the more susceptible you become.|$|R

40|$|I N THE DISCUSSION of thestructure of a microcomputer,we {{described}} the various data paths in a microcomputer, includ-ing data input, data output, exter-nal device addressing, {{in and out}} function pulses, and interrupt sig-nals. These are the vital lines of communication between the micro-computer and the "outside world," i. e., those signal lines that are neces-sary to interface the micro-processing unit (MPU) to the in-put/output (I/O) devices {{that you would like}} to control. I/G devices Some useful definitions pertain-ing to I/O devices are given in the table. The traditional view of an I/O device is that it is somewhat large or complex. Card readers, magnetic tape units, cathode-ray tube dis-plays, and Teletypes certainly fit such a description. However, a sin-gle integrated circuit chip, such as a latch, shift register, counter, or small memory, can also be consider-ed an I/O device to a computer. Another important point is that several device select pulses (synchronization pulses) may be required to interface a single I/O device. For example, a 74198 shift register has a pair of control inputs that determine whether the register shifts left, shifts right, or parallel-loads eight bits of data. This chip also has a clock input and a clear input. Thus, a single 74198 chip, when serving as an output device, may require up to four device select lines from the microcomputer. Therefore, the fact that we can generate 256 different input and 256 different output device select pulses does not necessarily mean that we can address 512 different "devices. " A more reasonable num-ber is of the order of 50 to 100 different devices. Device select pulses are inexpen-sive and easy to implement. We encourage their use <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> possible <b>as</b> <b>you</b> attempt to substi...|$|R
