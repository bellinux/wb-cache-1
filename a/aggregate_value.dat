With 100 deals valued at US$3.5 billion, Singapore saw a record value of PE and VC investments in 2016.

The first algorithm is a centralized one assuming that all data are available at a central location, and the other is a distributed search algorithm that does not require such a central location. The centralized algorithm has a linear time complexity with respect to the length of the time series, and the distributed algorithm employs the Threshold Algorithm by Fagin et al. and is quite efficient in reducing the communication cost as shownbytheexperimentsreportedinthepaper. ...|$|R

Cereals are not a net export and are far more than balanced by imports of the same commodities. As regards sugar, nearly 90 per cent of Germany's pre-war exports came to the United Kingdom.[128] An increase in this trade might be stimulated by a grant of a preference {{in this country to}} German sugar or by an arrangement by which sugar was taken in part payment for the indemnity on the same lines as has been proposed for coal, dyes, etc. Paper exports also might be capable of some increase. Leather goods, furs, and silks depend upon corresponding imports {{on the other side of}} the account. Silk goods are largely in competition with the trade of France and Italy. The remaining items are individually very small. I have heard it suggested that the indemnity might be paid to a great extent in potash and the like.
