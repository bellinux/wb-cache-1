40|$|The {{method of}} {{calculation}} of the magnetic field <b>alternating</b> <b>component</b> at {{the surface of the}} rotating rotor of turbo generator is presented. It is based on multiposition of the numerical calculations of the magnetic field with the rotor turns and changes of currents in the stator winding. Discrete time functions of the <b>alternating</b> <b>component</b> of the magnetic induction are selected in points of the surface. The harmonic analysis is conducted for them. The developed method is universal in terms of excitation modes, designs and the magnetic core saturation. The theory is confirmed by computational researches in the no-load and short circuit modes of large turbo generator. In it, the <b>alternating</b> <b>component</b> of the magnetic induction on the rotor surface in the short-circuit mode is much greater than in the no-load mode. Values and harmonic composition of the <b>alternating</b> <b>component</b> of the magnetic induction differ substantially at different points of the rotor surface. Harmonics are ponderable in the range from the level determined by the phase structure of stator winding to the level determined by the tooth structure of its core. The results obtained are qualitatively fit into the classical notion of oscillatory processes of the magnetic field on the rotor surface, but now the value and harmonic composition of the <b>alternating</b> <b>component</b> of the magnetic induction receive adequate numerical filling.

This analysis was performed in three phases, all using the DIAL finite element code. The first phase was a static stress analysis to determine the mean (non-varying) stress and static margin of safety for the part. The loads involved were steady state pressure and centrifugal force due to spinning. The second phase of the analysis was a modal survey to determine the vibrational modes and natural frequencies of the impeller. The third phase was a dynamic response analysis to determine the <b>alternating</b> <b>component</b> of the stress due to time varying pressure impulses at the outlet (diffuser) side of the impeller. The results of the three phases of the analysis show that the Third Stage Impeller operates very near the upper limits of its capability at full power level (FPL) loading. The static loading alone creates stresses in some areas of the shroud which exceed the yield point of the material. Additional cyclic loading due to the dynamic force could lead to a significant reduction in the life of this part.

The method {{is based on}} local illumination of the investigated structure with two differently absorbed light beams. The two beams simultaneously illuminate initially {{one side of a}} local range of the structure and then the other side. The intensities оf the light beams are modulated at one frequency so the alternating photovoltage becomes zero. In this case short circuit current mode is established for its <b>alternating</b> <b>component.</b> As a consequence the nonilluminated parts of the structure do not shunt its illuminated part. The ratios of the light beam intensities are measured under these conditions.

The calculations were performed at low injection for one dimensional case. The nomograms were calculated at 1064 and 808  nm wavelengths for various thicknesses of the n+–p(n) –p+ structures and various modulation frequencies. We found that the nomograms depend little if any on the modulation frequency if the nonequilibrium carrier lifetime is less than the modulation period. We also established that the nomograms of thin structures undergo essential shifts and changes in pattern if the diffusion time of the nonquilibrium carriers from the rear side of the structure to its face side becomes shorter than the nonequilibrium carrier lifetime. In this case the nomograms can only be used for determining the surface recombination rate of the nonquilibrium carriers at the rear side of the structure...|$|E

We collect and motivate all the results that contribute to the proof of this equality, and do {{a good deal of the}} work in detail. This result can be interpreted in different ways.

40|$|Component {{inspection}} is {{an important}} part of the facilities management process, especially as repair projects play an increasing role in the life of public facilities management organizations. The decisions facility owners make with regard to component inspection effect the eventual success of their major facility repair projects. This thesis uses a total cost approach to evaluate the effect component inspection methods have on facility repair projects. This problem is examined by comparing the penalty cost of inadequate component inspection to the costs of <b>alternate</b> <b>component</b> inspection methods that could have minimized the penalty cost. A general framework is developed to classify the errors that occur in component inspection and predict the penalty costs. Six major facility repair projects in which inadequate component inspection led to penalty coasts are presented and analyzed. The evidence from these cases shows that owners should pursue more costly and more accurate component inspection methods. The reduction in penalty costs due to increased accuracy outweighs the added cost so that the total cost is less. These cases also point to the usefulness of automated non-contract component inspection strategy by facility owners that considers <b>alternate</b> <b>component</b> inspection methods as part of the design of facility repair projects. An understanding of the penalty cost concepts presented here will be useful to owners in the design of a component inspection strategy.

40|$|Theoretical {{aspects of}} ion {{separation}} in imperfect {{fields of the}} quadrupole mass analyzer operating within the first, second, and third stability regions are applied to simulate transmission and resolution by using an analytical approach. A mathematical simulation based on statistical mechanics reveals in analytical form that the region of beam capture, i. e., the transmission, is inversely proportional to the relative values of the mass analyzer distortions to the 1. 18 th power in log scale. Otherwise, taking into account tails of peaks from unstable ion trajectories shows that the maximum attainable resolution is directly proportional {{to the number of}} cycles the ions spend in the field to the 1. 33 rd power. Because the ion current is amplitude modulated by the frequency of the <b>alternating</b> <b>component</b> of the field, transmission losses because of a parasitic modulation increase more than tenfold as the resolution and distortion increase. These losses are reduced to a minimum by applying a heterogeneous standing wave voltage to the mass analyzer with a linear distribution of amplitude along the ion transit axis. This additional standing wave increases the transmission tenfold. This procedure has the additional advantage of ion injection at zero phase in each cycle of the radiofrequency (rf) field. Experimental verification of the techniques used to avoid transmission losses caused by field distortions indicates the validity of the simulation results. The coarse approximation by means of the operating surface of electrodes in the form of rings instead of a solenoid to create a heterogeneous standing wave voltage applied to the mass analyzer with a linear distribution of amplitude along the drift axis increases the transmission by a factor of 5 compared with a traditional coupling mass filter with pre- and post-filters. Such a comparison proves the advantages of ion injection into the mass analyzer at zero phase in each cycle of an rf field. This reduces the mechanical tolerances of the mass analyzer by an order of magnitude and creates prospects for an increase in attainable resolution by using electrodes of circular profile...|$|E
40|$|Using the {{recently}} proposed density matrix renormalization group technique [1] {{we show that}} the magnons in the S = 1 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain effectively behaves as bosons that condense at a critical field hc.

Mg Typeset using REVTEX 1 It is by now well established both experimentally [2] and theoretically [3 – 7] that the S = 1 antiferromagnetic chain has a gap, ∆, to a triplet excitation above a singlet groundstate. Thus the magnetization, M, remains strictly zero up to a critical field hc = ∆. For the quasi-one-dimensional system NENP the critical field is found to be about 10 T [8] for a field applied along the symmetry axis. The behavior of M(h) just above hc {{has been the subject of}} some theoretical work [9 – 11]. The existing experimental results [12] appear to be dominated by extraneous effects such as an off-diagonal <b>alternating</b> <b>component</b> of the gyromagnetic tensor [13], inter-chain coupling, anisotropies and impurities. This problem can be solved using a boson quasi-particle model involving triplet magnons with repulsive interactions for parallel spins [11]. This model predicts that hc = ∆. (We set the Bohr magneton and g-factors to one.) At this field the “rest-mass energy ” of the magnons is exactly cancelled by their Zeeman energy and one-dimensional Bose condensation occurs. What prevents a catastrophe from occurring at hc is the inter-magnon repulsion which governs the behavior of M(h) above hc. To calculate M(h) we need to calculate the energy, E(M) of a very dilute system of M polarized magnons in their ground-state. M(h) is then found by inverting the equation: h = dE/dM. It was argued in Ref. [11] that the behavior of E(M) is the same as for a system of non-relativistic non-interacting fermions: kF E = (∆ − h) M + L −kF d...|$|E
