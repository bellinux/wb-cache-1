25|$|I {{think every}} {{director}} {{thinks that he}} hasn't been allowed to make the films he wanted to make. I certainly haven't {{been able to make}} as many Westerns as I've wanted. (But) sometimes staying alive in a career sense is very important, and you think, 'Maybe I'll do this, which will do well and <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do that.' It's very easy to miscalculate. It's a dangerous game. But I think in the end, none of us have anybody to blame except ourselves. It can be very hard. The kinds of things that directors most want to do are usually not things the studio perceives to be commercially viable. It really is that simple. Is that true of me? Sure. Absolutely. But it's no more true of me than 50 other people I know.|$|E

500|$|Although Marshall was not {{frequently}} {{active in}} {{debate on the}} Senate floor, he was a strong advocate of nearly every Federalist measure considered in that body. Many of these were unpopular in Kentucky, including the Alien and Sedition Acts. Marshall's {{vote in favor of}} the Jay Treaty was particularly unpopular with his constituents, and when he returned home after the vote, a mob of angry citizens in Frankfort stoned him. Next, the mob tried to throw Marshall into the Kentucky River. Marshall appealed to the Baptists in the crowd, declaring, [...] "Now <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> say that according to Baptist rules, it is irregular to administer baptism before the receiver gives his experience. If you are determined to proceed, let the exercise be performed in decent order. Let me give my experience first."

In the subsequent senatorial election, however, Breckinridge defeated Marshall for his seat.|$|E
500|$|Both Hollywood trade {{publications}} were positive: David Hunter of The Hollywood Reporter predicted {{it to be}} a sleeper hit {{and called}} it [...] "outstanding," [...] while Lael Loewenstein of Variety called it [...] "a visually appealing, well-crafted film [...] an unalloyed success."

[...] Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle agreed that the storytelling was far superior to other animated films, and cited the characters as plausible and noted the richness of moral themes. Jeff Millar of the Houston Chronicle agreed with the basic techniques as well, and concluded the voice cast excelled with a great script by Tim McCanlies.

40|$|In {{the present}} text I discuss Michael Oakeshott’s idea of liberal {{education}} {{and its main}} menace, authority.

Page was replaced by Sam Moran, who had served as an understudy for The Wiggles for five years and had already stood in for Page for 150 shows. Initially, The Wiggles struggled over their decision to replace Page, but after their audience's positive response to Moran, they decided to continue as a group because they thought that was what their young audience would want. [...] According to Fatt, who called it [...] "a huge decision" [...] and [...] "a teachable moment" [...] for them, they chose to be honest with their young audience as they made the transition from Page to Moran.

500|$|Hooker's vocal {{alternates}} between sung {{and spoken}} sections. [...] Commenting on Hooker's vocal sections, music historian Ted Gioia notes, [...] "The song has almost no melody. [...] Even less harmony. [...] In fact, {{it is hard}} to call it a song. [...] It's more like a bit of jive steam of consciousness in 4/4 time." [...] Some of the lyrics are borrowed from earlier songs that date {{back to the beginning of}} the blues. [...] The opening line [...] "My mama she didn't <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> stay out all night long" [...] has origins in [...] "Mama Don't Allow", an old dance song. [...] Several songs were recorded in the 1920s with similar titles. [...] "Boogie No. 3" [...] by boogie-woogie pianist Cow Cow Davenport has sung and spoken sections and includes the lines, [...] "I don't care what Grandma don't allow, play my music anyhow, Grandma's don't 'llow no music playin' in here". Hooker's first and second takes of the song include similar verses and the narrative about Henry's Swing Club, but do not include the crucial mid-song hook [...] "Boogie, chillen'!" [...] before the guitar break, which gives the song its lyrical identity.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, OutKast's {{original}} {{record label}} Arista Records was restructured under the Jive label group.

In July 2009, Big Boi left Jive Records, following creative differences and the label's unwillingness to release and promote his solo album. According to Big Boi, Jive gave him an ultimatum to shop the album elsewhere. In an interview for GQ, he discussed his release from Jive and his discontent with the label for proposing he record a cover of rapper Lil Wayne's [...] "Lollipop", stating [...] "They told me to go in and make my version of Lil Wayne's Lollipop! I love that song... But how you gonna tell me to go bite another MCs style?... That's the highest form of disrespect ever. So that's when I wanted to get off Jive.

The first key shift in my practice was to move from observation to temporary action as a mean to engage with local actors. I acted upon the spatial characteristics of the environments that I observed to catalyse behaviour of local actors upon their environment. A second key shift was to combine action and observation as I recorded the behaviour of people upon the environment that I produced. This double role <b>allowed</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> engage with and reveal potential from the urban situation I produced.
