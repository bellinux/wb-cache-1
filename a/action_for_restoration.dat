50|$|A {{detailed}} study of the physico-chemical and bio-chemical parameters of the lake waters {{carried out in the}} period 1981-2001 confirmed the deteriorating status of the lake necessitating <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>restoration.</b> There was a high percentage of chemicals but low percentage of total plankton (43%). The activity of chemicals lead to the liberation of extra quantity of cellular products which increased to 53.19%. Lake indicated high productivity of bio-chemical products; with death and decay of algal blooms adding to the biochemical concentration. The lake waters showed high electrolytes, low dissolved oxygen, high phosphate and nitrogen content with abundance of plankton blooms, all of which have contributed to a high degree of eutrophication. The non potability of the water body is indicated by the high degree of faecal contamination with organisms that produce H2S that may include forms of Salmonella, Proteus, Citrobacter and some strains of Klebsiella. The distribution pattern of plank tonic forms, for the decade ending 2001, as per laboratory tests of lake’s water samples provides the values of parameters such as the Chlorococcales, Desmids, Diatoms, Blue-greens and Euglenoids, as the biological indicators of water body, as given in table below which testify to the lake’s eutrophication status. The numbers indicate the microorganisms present in the sample per litre.|$|E

40|$|Crystal River is {{designated}} {{by the state of}} Florida as class Ill water and an Oustanding Florida Water (OFW). In addition, in 1988, Crystal River was designated a priority waterbody by the Surface Water Improvement and Management (SWIM) Program under the SWIM Act of 1987. Kings Bay, the headwaters of Crystal River, is known for its abundance of manatees and contains several federal manatee sanctuaries. Kings Bay is the main driving force for the local ecotourism economy. In recent years, the reduction in water clarity and the increase in the cyanobacterium, Lyngbya wollei, in the Crystal River system has placed additional emphasis on the need to restore Kings Bay. The 2000 Crystal River Surface Water Improvement and Management Plan acknowledges these as the major issues for this watershed and set a goal to restore water clarity to a horizontal secchi of 45 feet. In order to accomplish this goal, this Capstone paper will review the unique geology, hydrology and natural history of the Crystal River/Kings Bay system, land use patterns and population within the watershed, and current research within Kings Bay to develop a management plan of <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>restoration.</b> This paper will guide future management efforts in developing a restoration working group for Kings Bay, and be the background and guide for the Kings Bay Restoration Plan to be developed by the working group.

40|$|Abstract: In Brazil, despite {{there being}} {{specific}} legislation regulating forced tax collection proceedings, these are still largely influenced by case law of national courts. We are {{now living in}} the third decade of Federal Law No. 6, 830, promulgated in 1980, which aimed to guarantee greater privileges to the treasury {{in the course of}} the debt collection saga. However, the many loopholes and lacunae gaping throughout the text have left all stakeholders – government, taxpayers and judges – somewhat exasperated. Part II of this Paper analyzes the main features of forced tax collection proceedings: registration of the tax liability, presumption of liquidity and certainty; definition of “responsible” persons in terms of the law; collateralization and challenges to the debt; and the tax liability vis-à-vis other debts. A brief look is given to other pieces of procedural legislation related to tax disputes, most importantly the suits for a writ of mandamus; <b>actions</b> <b>for</b> <b>restoration</b> of undue payments, and <b>actions</b> <b>for</b> annulment. Finally, summaries of case law of the Superior Court of Justice are considered. These form an essential part of Brazilian sources of case law, most especially in tax proceedings...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDespite being {{inside a}} {{protected}} area, Lake Sumidouro has been {{impacted by the}} anthropogenic occupation of the surrounding area since the 1970 &# 8217;s, compromising the ecological integrity {{of the lake and}} the sustainable use of natural resources. This study examined the current trophic classification of the lake and developed methods for improving it through an integrated analysis of morphometric and limnological parameters, land use and land occupation in the watershed, and eutrophication potential. Data for the limnological parameters, land use and land occupation, and morphometric characteristics of Lake Sumidouro were collected in the rainy and dry seasons of 2009 and 2010. Depending on the trophic classification system used, Lake Sumidouro is classified as oligotrophic to hypereutrophic. In our study, the highest concentration of nutrients occurred in the rainy season, indicating that high nutrient inputs played an important role during this period. Areas of anthropogenic occupation comprised approximately 62. 9 % of the total area of the watershed, with pasture and urban settlement as the main types of land use. The influent total phosphorus load was estimated to be 15, 824. 3 kg/year. To maintain mesotrophic conditions, this load must be reduced by 29. 4 %. By comparing the isolated use of trophic state indices, this study demonstrated that comparing the trophic state classification with morphometric analyses, land use and land occupation types in the watershed, and potential phosphorus load provided better information to guide management <b>actions</b> <b>for</b> <b>restoration</b> and conservation. Furthermore, this approach also allowed for evaluating the vulnerability of the environment to the eutrophication process...|$|R

40|$|Background {{and problem}} discussion: In the Gulf of Mexico on 20 th of April 2010 {{there was a}} large {{environmental}} accident as an oil rig exploded and a huge oil spill occurred. An unforeseen event, such as an accident, may for example affect a company’s reputation and financial situation. Over the past century a number of major oil spills leading to disastrous environmental consequences have occurred. If a catastrophe is caused by a company, they must respond to and communicate with their stakeholders if not to reduce the reputational capital. If they do not provide the right type of information quickly, it may aggravate the crisis for the company. In this paper the authors examine how the crisis information presented by a company in its quarterly reports change during the year an accident occurred. Aim: The aim of this thesis is to find out how crisis information changes in companies’ quarterly reports. The authors wanted to understand what kind of information and what amount of information companies present, how they are affected by laws and IFRS frameworks, and if the companies express that they take responsibility for the occurred event or not. Method: The thesis is a case study of BP and their quarterly reports from 2010. The authors have made a content analysis of the quarterly reports and have focused on how a company described a crisis. Focus has been on aspects like the amount of information, if the company takes responsibility and how they refer to laws and regulations they have to follow. Empirical findings and conclusions: BP wrote in all of their reports that they follow the laws and the standards required. After the accident they wrote about what responsibility they took by presenting information about the <b>actions</b> <b>for</b> <b>restoration</b> they made, such as paying for claims and costs caused by the oil spill. The information between the reports two to four did not differ much other than for some exceptions related to amounts and specific occurrences during each period. The first report was not influenced by the oil spill and was not directly comparable to the other three reports {{when it came to the}} change of information concerning the oil spill. The authors made the conclusion that BP took responsibility for the work after the accident but not for the accident itself. BP used personal pronouns when they wanted readers to notice positive information and they sometimes used a mitigated language and wrote negative information by using long and more complex sentences. Suggestions for further research: Investigate the oil spill from medias point of view, or after a couple of years do another study about BP to see how the oil spill has affected the development of the company’s financial situation during these years...|$|R

40|$|In {{the urban}} health evaluation, the {{environmental}} comfort (thermo-hygrometrical, acoustical and lighting comfort and IAQ) represents a fundamental aspect {{to quantify the}} influence of the climate and of the human activities on the men's health. The correlations among outdoor comfort, urban landscape and architectural features offer wide perspectives, as they could represent very useful means to give a qualitative and quantitative judgment on the existing real estate or to choose the major <b>actions</b> <b>for</b> the <b>restoration</b> of the urban environment. To obtain urban health global judgment, all the playing factors must be correctly weighted and associated. An analysis based on homogeneous quantities is needed, avoiding multiplying judgment scales and using, for example, one scale for each involved parameter comparable with the others. To quantify and correlate the various environmental elements, a first attempt was performed aimed at a global assessment {{on the basis of a}} mutual judgment system. In this paper a proposal of schematisation based on indicators and index has been developed. With the definition of them, relating to the acoustical outdoor comfort evaluation, it is possible to obtain a global quality environment evaluation considering also other aspects like, for example, thermo-hygrometrical and atmospheric pollution effects. First analyses to validate the method on the basis of experimental and simulated sound pressure levels have been developed. Moreover, noise level data, traffic and population density were considered as basic parameters on which it is possible to develop single indicators and a global acoustic quality index. In the meantime a subjective investigation was performed, to correlate the values of the acoustical index to the individual sensation of the people living in the zones of the investigation...|$|R
