5000|$|Initial {{optimism}} for {{the line}} soon {{gave way to}} disappointment as <b>anticipated</b> <b>freight</b> and passenger use failed to materialise. The LSWR's control over Guildford and its attitude towards the LBSCR ensured that little through traffic to the South Coast was routed through the Cranleigh line, whose main source of freight was the transport of coal to local residents and the gasworks at Cranleigh, as well as agricultural feed and machinery. Farmers also used the line to transport their goods to market in Guildford and Horsham. As stations on the line were not equipped with freight facilities, these now had to be added: those at Baynards (initially known as [...] "Little Vachery") and Cranleigh became quite substantial with the involvement of commercial operators.|$|E
40|$|This thesis studies {{two related}} topics in liner shipping. The first topic is the {{contract}} pricing problem for container carriers. The second part studies {{the interaction of}} the longer term contracts and the spot markets/exchanges for the same goods/services. Most containerized freight is transported under the provisions of medium term contracts between ocean carriers and shippers. One of the biggest challenges for an ocean carrier is to find optimal ways to structure the prices in those contracts. In particular, an ocean carrier would like to set the prices such that the best match between supply and demand can be obtained to maximize its profit. We propose three optimization models as decision tools that carriers can use to plan the contract price structures, as well as the <b>anticipated</b> <b>freight</b> flows and empty container flows for the period covered by the contracts. Based on the models, we propose algorithms and build decision tools that generate the following output: optimal prices to be charged for the movement of freight, the <b>anticipated</b> <b>freight</b> flows and empty flows, containers to be leased, rented and purchased, and the additional voyage capacities to be procured. The first two models are deterministic and represent the problem at different levels of detail. In addition, a three-stage stochastic model is proposed to handle uncertainties in demand rates, costs, bookings and transit times on feeder arcs. Recent developments in information technology and communication make spot transactions more economical and more convenient. Nevertheless, the incidental spot transactions still count for only a very small portion of freight transported both by the large carriers who are the leaders in implementing e-commerce and in the industry as a whole. The second part of the thesis studies models to provide insight into the effect of spot market participation rates on various economic quantities. This may have implications for freight transportation industries, such as the sea cargo industry, in which longer term contracts are still prevalent. We focus our study on the following situation. Option contracts are signed before the demand is observed. As is common in liner shipping, sellers (carriers) also sell goods/services on the spot. Buyers (shippers) may or may not buy in the spot market as a matter of policy. We investigate the effects of spot market participation on the contract market and on the surpluses of all market players. It is found that the contract market shrinks as more and more buyers participate in the spot market. However, the effects on the surpluses of different market players are much more complicated and depend on the following factors: market structure, demand variation along time, demand variation among buyers and capacity level.

However the line was built to commuter railway standard, <b>anticipating</b> <b>freight</b> and intercity services to Mainland China which were cancelled and superseded by the Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Rail Link Hong Kong section.|$|R

50|$|A 2010 New Jersey Department of Transportation report <b>anticipated</b> {{increased}} <b>freight</b> {{activity in}} South Jersey. New infrastructure at the Port of Paulsboro, where SMS Rail Lines handles interchanges with Conrail Shared Assets Operations, includes {{the construction of}} a rail crossing, turnouts, and 11000 ft of track with a link to the Penns Grove Secondary and a balloon loop for dockside accessibility. It is expected to cost $3.2 million and be completed by 2014. Partial federal funding for this work was obtained in 2011 by SJPC, Conrail, and Salem County by leveraging $117.65 million of infrastructure funding for the marine terminal and other South Jersey projects.|$|R

"As the ocean, {{for a long}} {{distance}} {{this side of the}} continent of Asia and the kingdom of Cathay, is known to abound with islands, we may expect first to meet with them, where, it would be doing nature herself injustice, did we not <b>anticipate</b> fragrant <b>freights</b> of balmy spices, and other valuable commodities with which that favored quarter of the earth, it is certain, is enriched. Indeed, it is scarce possible for the imagination to conceive of the magnitude of the results that await our success, while naught but ridicule and contempt could attend a hasty and inconsiderate return. Going not as invaders, but as Christians and friends, {{we have no reason to}} expect other than the most friendly reception; and, no doubt, the presents and gifts, alone, that will naturally be offered to strangers who have come so far, and by a road that hath hitherto been untravelled, will forty-fold repay you for all your toils and troubles.|$|R
5000|$|The company ordered three Supermarine Channel flying boats. The {{delivery}} of the planes were delayed and not until 16 August did operations commence, then with Friedrichshafen FF.49C planes {{owned and operated by}} A/S Aero. Later, DNL used its ownd planes and crew. One of the aircraft crashed, but without fatalities. On one flight, a drunk passenger tried to choke the pilot Riiser-Larsen, but he managed to fight off the passenger. Operations were terminated on 15 September. Several problems were encountered, due to weather conditions, mechanical failures of the aircraft, local strikes and delivery problems, so the regularity achieved was a disappointing 94%. Most flights were made with mail only, and only a total of 64 passengers were carried. Additionally the <b>anticipated</b> increase in <b>freight</b> volume did not happen, and towards the end, only around 300 letters were carried per flight.|$|R
40|$|Freight {{transportation}} {{demand is}} projected to grow to 27. 5 billion tons in 2040, and to nearly 30. 2 billion tons in 2050. This report describes the current and future demand for freight transportation in terms of tons and ton-miles of commodities moved by truck, rail, water, pipeline, and air freight carriers. It outlines the economic, logistics, transportation, and policy and regulatory factors that shape freight demand, the trends and 2050 outlook for these factors, and their <b>anticipated</b> effect on <b>freight</b> demand. After describing federal policy actions that could influence future freight demand, the report then summarizes the capabilities of available analytical models for forecasting freight demand. This is {{one in a series}} of reports produced {{as a result of the}} Transportation Energy Futures project, a Department of Energy-sponsored multi-agency effort to pinpoint underexplored strategies for reducing GHGs and petroleum dependence related to transportation...|$|R
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the Dutch {{waterway}} transport system with emphasis on the efficiency and equity impacts of current and future infrastructure and policy measures. Efforts have focused on looking at building a model system for inland waterways. This allowed a more detailed insight into the long-term development possibilities of inland waterways traffic {{in and around the}} Netherlands. The result of this research is a model system for the inland waterway freight traffic, keeping in mind the objectives of the Dutch ministry of inland waterway transport. These objectives are to develop a model that would allow for stimulus-response analysis of the waterway system traffic flow. Stimulus refers to autonomous developments in infrastructure and policy measures that {{are in the process of}} being implemented or will be realized in the future. Response refers to the <b>anticipated</b> reaction of <b>freight</b> traffic flow to the stimulus. The concern is how would shippers and carriers react to changes in the infrastructure and what are the equity impacts of various policies. The model can analyze the current state of the waterway system and make systematic predictions on the future impacts of changes in the infrastructure and policy measures.
