40|$|Introduction: One {{dimension}} of self-identity {{that has received}} much attention in the psychological literature is athletic identity. The large amount {{of interest in this}} concept is unsurprising due to the rising level of professionalism in sport over the past two decades, especially in Australia. The Athletic Identity Measurement Scale (AIMS) is a popular tool used to assess this construct, comprising ten statements encompassing the strength and exclusivity of identification with the <b>athletic</b> <b>role.</b> The current study aimed to assess differences in levels of athletic identity among elite Australian athletes as a result of gender, age, and career status. Method: Principal axis factoring extracted three interpretable factors from the AIMS responses of 426 elite athletes (251 females) on sporting scholarships linked with the Australian Institute of Sport. These factors were identified as social identity, the degree to which individuals perceive themselves as occupying the <b>athletic</b> <b>role,</b> exclusivity, the degree to which individuals’ self-worth relies on the <b>athletic</b> <b>role,</b> and negative affectivity, the degree to which individuals react negatively when unable to participate in sport. These factors were consistent with those labelled by past research. Results/Discussion: Group differences were found in relation to gender, age, and career status. Significant differences were found with male athletes showing higher levels on the total AIMS than females, but not on negative affectivity. Older athletes showed decreased levels of athletic identity compared to younger athletes, and retired athletes showed low levels of exclusivity. Implications of these findings addressing the needs of elite athletes will be discussed. [Presented at the asics Conference of science and medicine in sport 2008...|$|E

The coaches assumed active roles in the academic lives of their athletes and facilitated the educational process by placing academics as a priority. The personal development property represented the roles of the coaches as counselors and parental figures, and teachers of life skills and priorities. The professional role described the obligations of the coaches towards the development of their sport and the coaching profession, as well as the conditions of working within an educational setting at the university level.

40|$|Retiring from elite sport {{can be a}} {{difficult}} and disruptive process for an elite athlete. To {{improve the quality of}} the transition after retirement, elite athletes are recommended to have dual careers which mean they combine their sport with education to be prepared for a new career when they retire from elite sport. To help elite student-athletes with this combination, universities and sport organizations provide different kind of support. This study was conducted and aimed to investigate elite athletes’ perceptions of support offered by a university in Sweden and the elite athletes’ perceptions of combining top level sport and academic studies. Questions about identity, balance and future were also examined. Qualitative interviews were made with nine elite student-athletes within the University. The results showed that elite student-athletes experience dual careers important and feel support from Universities and Sports Organizations is needed for this combination. The results also showed that elite student-athletes knowledge of support functions is lacking and that there are missing different kinds of support.

However, the tendency to promote a healthier" and more athletic female body ideal has received minimal critical attention. This study aims at exploring the underlying conditions for such an athletic ideal through asking: How is the female athletic body constructed in the contemporary women's fitness magazine, Det Nye ShapeUp"? We investigated our object of inquiry through a modified version of Parker's (1992) approach to Foucauldian discourse analysis and analysed the interviews of four <b>athletic</b> <b>role</b> models in Det Nye ShapeUp". We identified four discourses: 1. Neo-liberal discourse", 2. Health discourse", 3. Discourse of surveillance and control" and 4. Discourse of emancipation". The 1. Neo-liberal discourse" constructs the female athletic body as something that the individual woman should strive for by appropriately managing her own resources, abilities and skills. The 2. Health discourse" constructs the female athletic body through a homeostatic logic where the individual is responsible and healthcare experts have the mandate to intervene in order to maintain good health. The 3. Discourse of surveillance and control" constructs the female athletic body as an internalized panoptic stance, disciplining women to accept hegemonic beauty ideals. The 4. Discourse of emancipation" accentuates that the female athletic body is alleviated from a culturally rigid body image and instead improved physical performance and functionality are considered good ends. The results and discussion indicate that the female athletic body is a result of a complex nexus of different discourses associated to the powers of economy, sex differences, institutions and ideological forces. We have advocated that magazines like Det Nye ShapeUp" can have covert disciplinary effects hidden by seemingly well-intentioned motives, which can contribute to women's objectification of their bodies. ...|$|E

In order to examine {{the relationship between the}}se variables, a convenience sample of 209 women’s basketball student-athletes from NCAA Division I (n = 62), NCAA Division II (n = 40), NCAA Division III (n = 50), and NAIA (n = 57) institutions located in the southeastern region of the United States participated in the study. Participants completed the Career Maturity Inventory-Revised Attitude Scale, the Athletic Identity Measurement Scale, and a demographic questionnaire. From the analyses, it was found that for women’s basketball student-athletes, stronger identification with the <b>athletic</b> <b>role</b> is associated with lower levels of career maturity. It was also found that NCAA Division I student-athletes had significantly higher levels of athletic identity and significantly lower levels of career maturity than Division II student-athletes. Likewise, student-athletes that planned to pursue a professional basketball career (n = 76) displayed significantly higher levels of athletic identity and significantly lower levels of career maturity than those that do not (n = 133).

40|$|Introduction: Retirement from elite sport marks {{a time of}} re-evaluation {{for athletes}} {{in many areas of}} life. Much {{research}} to date has indicated that this transition can have a marked impact upon an individual both socially and psychologically, while other studies have found no correlation between retirement difficulties and overall life satisfaction. One topic that has attracted much attention in the career transition literature is that of athletic identity. Athletic identity refers {{to the extent to which}} individuals identify with an <b>athletic</b> <b>role.</b> Research findings in this area indicate that athletes who possess a strong and exclusive level of athletic identity take longer to adapt to their post-sport life, and are more prone to experiencing psychosocial and career identity difficulties later in life. The current study aimed to track and compare the athletic identity levels, life satisfaction and career decision-making difficulties reported by Australian elite athletes over a three year period. Method: The participants in the study were 64 athletes (45 females) on sporting scholarships linked with the Australian Institute of Sport, a group for whom the term “athletic identity” has strong relevance. Participants were surveyed using the Athletic Identity Measurement Scale (AIMS), Life Satisfaction Scale (LSS) and the Career Decision Difficulties Questionnaire (CDDQ) in 2003 and again in 2006. The entire initial cohort was able to be followed up in 2006. Of this original group, 30 participants had retired from elite sport at follow-up. Results/discussion: Non-parametric tests were used to investigate differences in athletic identity, life satisfaction and career decision-making difficulties overtime within and between the continuing athlete and retired athlete groups. Overall, the retired athletes’ levels of athletic identity were found to decrease significantly over the three years, whereas the continuing athletes were found to maintain the same level of athletic identity. Implications of these and other findings, related to levels of life satisfaction and career indecision, will be discussed in relation to the experience of the transition to retirement from elite sport...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. P. P. A., Public Policy and Administration) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2015. Health {{policy experts}} {{recommend}} that adolescents engage {{in at least}} 60 minutes of physical activity per day. In California, fewer adolescents are reaching these guidelines, with declining activity levels as age increases. A higher prevalence of inactivity in addition to rising obesity rates prompts policy concern because of the increased risk of developing chronic health conditions such as Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, which affect long-term health. There is a national policy debate occurring about the declining emphasis on physical education within schools, given evidence that {{it has the potential}} to improve exercise habits. From a California standpoint, my research explores whether more physical education participation causes increases in adolescent exercise behaviors, to determine why is there a declining emphasis on physical education, and to identify the primary policy and practical barriers to increasing time for high school students to spend in physical education. Using 2, 799 adolescent observations from the 2011 - 2012 California Health Interview Survey, I conduct a regression analysis to quantify the influence of high school physical education participation on overall activity levels. Since many factors influence activity behaviors, which I cannot fully capture in a quantitative analysis, I also conduct nine interviews across state and local education entities to explore the policy and practical barriers to investing time into physical education. My regression results show that physical education participation does not influence the choice to exercise, but among adolescents who are at least somewhat active, it does influence the amount that they choose to engage in each day. Combined with my interview results, I confirm prior literature that the following socio-demographic and environmental factors influence adolescent activity levels: gender, age, income, neighborhood safety, access to activity opportunities after school, and education support of quality physical education. My results add to prior research, showing that having an <b>athletic</b> <b>role</b> model positively influences activity behaviors. Based on my findings, I recommend investing in an educational culture that values physical education as an instructional priority and in community partnerships to create more opportunities for adolescent activity outside of school hours. Ensuring that physical education is an instructional priority requires investing in both the quality and quantity of the program, creating more professional development opportunities, ensuring that facilities are adequate and physical education teachers hold the proper credentials to teach the standards-based curriculum. Based on findings that resource discrepancies pose greater barriers for schools serving a large proportion of low-income students, districts can effectively collaborate with community members to promote activity at the broader local level through use of required Local Control and Accountability Plans (LCAP) to ensure that their spending matches state priorities for students.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} Black female collegiate athletes' perception of mentors and the characteristics of their current mentors. Understanding their definition of a mentor and the persons whom fulfill the psychosocial and career mentor roles will provide insight on the mentor-mentee relationship. In addition, the researchers found it necessary to ascertain the persons whom fulfill the <b>athletic</b> mentor <b>role</b> due to the collegiate athletic status. This study is approached from a critical feminist lens, utilizing a qualitative questionnaire to capture and analyze the voice and perceptions of the Black female athletes (nÂ =Â  38) from two Division I universities. Critical race theory and Black feminist thought were employed to capture the "multiple jeopardies" of the Black female athlete, thus recognizing race, or racism, and gender, or sexism, are at the fore of their daily experiences. The findings revealed Black female athletes' definitions of a mentor were characterized by the traditional mentor qualities such as a guide, a supporter, and a role model. Further analysis indicated the women had three distinctly different persons to fulfill each mentor dimension to include: career/academic support, psychosocial support, and athletic support. However, the characteristics of those persons who fulfilled each dimension were family members, with greater influence by the coach on the athletic support dimension. Based on the findings it would benefit administrators to recognize these characteristics and persons of influence when providing support services and developmental programs for the Black female collegiate athlete.
