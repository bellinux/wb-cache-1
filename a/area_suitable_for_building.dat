[...] As the marsh quickly stabilized with the weight of the infill, the area quickly became an industrial district. By 1850 the area was used for shipbuilding and repair, butchery and meat production, and oyster and clam fishing.

5000|$|The compass {{was invented}} in China during the Han Dynasty between the 2nd century BC and 1st century AD, where {{it was called the}} [...] "south-governor" [...] (sīnán [...] ). The {{magnetic}} compass was not, at first, used for navigation, but for geomancy and fortune-telling by the Chinese. The earliest Chinese magnetic compasses were possibly used to order and harmonize buildings in accordance with the geomantic principles of feng shui. These early compasses were made with lodestone, a form of the mineral magnetite that is a naturally occurring magnet and aligns itself with the Earth’s magnetic field. People in ancient China discovered that if a lodestone was suspended so it could turn freely, it would always point toward the magnetic poles. Early compasses were used to choose <b>areas</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>building</b> houses and to search for rare gems. Compasses were later adapted for navigation during the Song Dynasty in the 11th century.|$|R
5000|$|The {{geological}} {{conditions of}} the Normandy beaches for the Invasion of Normandy were investigated by the American and British MGU. Some of the civilian scientists were sent ashore months before the invasion. [...] "...civilian scientists, {{not all of them}} young or signally muscled, landed on the beaches... wriggling along on their bellies, within range of German guns, they obtained samples of sand soil so when the tanks and trucks bustled ashore the drivers would be prepared for the terrain the equipment would be on hand to bridge the worst spots." [...] Research in 17th and 18th century French geological reports showed the land had clay underneath the sand which would bog down tanks and other vehicles. To find out the truth, geologists went ashore before the invasions with boring tools {{to find out if the}} old reports were correct, and special equipment was developed to overcome the problem.For the invasion, large scale maps, in three editions, of the Normandy beach conditions of 1:5,000 were printed in great secrecy, with each map numbered for controlled use. Few copies of these maps survived the war. Other maps were prepared to show the best <b>areas</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>building</b> airfields, and of water supply locations.|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the structural competence of the subsurface geological materials around Led School Area in Bishini, NW Nigeria to delineate the <b>area</b> that is <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>building</b> development. Twenty Seven vertical electrical soundings (VES) points were occupied {{in the study}} area employing ABEM Terrameter SAS 300 C with Schlumberger electrode configuration of maximum electrode separation AB/ 2 = 150 m. The field resistivity data were interpreted using Win RESIST software. The results from the 2 -D interpretation of the VES data were used to prepare the geoelectric sections along four cross sections. The interpreted results showed that the geoelectric sections consist of three to five layers, which are: Top soil, Laterite, Lateritic clay, weathered layer and Fresh basement. The resistivity value and subsurface layer thickness for the top soil varied from 191. 7 Ω m to 8146 Ωm and 0. 3 m to 7. 0 m respectively. The Laterite layer had resistivity values ranging from 1000 Ωm to 1627. 3 Ωm and thickness between 1. 8 m and 2. 5 m. The weathered layer resistivity varied from 33. 5 Ω m to 850 Ω m with thickness of 3. 6 m to 44 m. The bedrock resistivity ranged from 1238. 3 Ωm to 33438. 6 Ωm. Geoelectric sections along profile 4 and 1 revealed the thinnest sequence of loose overburden materials and fresh basement at the shallowest depth. The area covered by these profiles is <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>building</b> development. Building development should not be located along profiles 2 and 3 due to relatively thick weathered layer. However the area may be considered for citing borehole to harness its groundwater potentials...|$|R
