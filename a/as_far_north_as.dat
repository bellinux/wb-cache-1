40|$|Abstract. Processes at the ice shelf-ocean {{interface}} and {{in particular}} in ice shelf cavities around Antarctica have an observable effect on the solutions of basin scale to global coupled ice-ocean models. Despite this, these processes are not routinely represented in global ocean and cli-mate models. It is shown that a new ice shelf cavity model for z-coordinate models can re-produce results from an intercomparison project of earlier approaches with vertical σ- or isopy-cnic coordinates. As a proof of concept, ice shelves are incorporated in a 100 year global in-tegration of a z-coordinate model. In this simulation, glacial melt water can be traced <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>north</b> <b>as</b> 15 ◦ S. The observed effects of processes in the ice shelf cavities agree with pre-vious results from a σ-coordinate model, notably the increase in sea ice thickness. However, melt rates are overestimated probably because the parameterization of basal melting does not suit the low resolution of this configuration. 1...|$|R
