40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 30 -November 02, 1989 / Town & Country Hotel & Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaIn video {{telemetry}} systems the transmitted picture rate, or temporal resolution, is {{a critical}} parameter in determining system performance {{as well as the}} transmitted bit rate. In many applications it is important to transmit every TV frame because the maximum temporal resolution must be maintained to analyze critical events such as an encounter between a missile and a target. Typical transmission bit rates for operation <b>at</b> <b>these</b> <b>picture</b> rates are 5. 0 to 10. 0 mbps. In other cases the frame rate can be reduced slightly to 15 or 7. 5 frames/sec. without significantly reducing the value of the output video. <b>At</b> <b>these</b> frame rates it is still possible to sense the continuity of motion although some jerkiness may appear on rapidly moving objects. <b>At</b> <b>these</b> reduced frame rates the transmitted bit rate can go as low as 1. 0 mbps. There is a third class of video telemetry applications where the scene is changing very slowly, and it is permissible to transmit a series of still pictures at very reduced rates. For example one picture can be transmitted every second at a transmission bit rate of 100 Kbps. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine operation of the standard video coding system (Range Commander Council Standard RCC 209) at conventional frame rates as well as a wide range of reduced frame rates. The following section describes the basic digital TV system which employs the standard codec. Two particular modes of operation are discussed: (1) those which reduce the frame rate by a fixed amount and vary the spatial resolution according to the complexity of the TV image; (2) those which maintain the spatial resolution at a fixed level and automatically vary the temporal resolution according to the complexity of the image. A tradeoff analysis is presented illustrating the interaction of spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and transmission bit rate. A video tape is described and presented illustrating system operation at a wide range of frame rates. Finally, conclusions are drawn...|$|R

I heard Daniel Dennett, last year, winding up his Royal Institute of Philosophy Millennial Lecture with the prediction: “I anticipate a day when philosophers and scientists and laypeople will chuckle over the fossil traces of our earlier bafflement about consciousness ” (Dennett, in press). And I thought at the time: that’s not quite right. Future philosophers won’t chuckle over the difficulties we now have with understanding consciousness- any more than we, today, chuckle over the difficulties people had two centuries ago with understanding the evolution of life. We chuckle when something is comical. But the spectacle of earnest seekers after truth trying their very best to make sense of something that is presently beyond their capacity is, I’d say, more chastening than comical.

40|$|This article {{illustrates}} the ‘visual turn’ approach to sports history {{in an analysis}} of traditionally under-researched material from the late nineteenth century. Focusing on football (‘soccer’) action photography, we argue that interpreting this visual material contributes significantly to the exploration and interpretation of the broader social and cultural context within which sports were practised and the visual material was produced. Regarding the latter, the photographer’s challenge was to capture the movement inherent in the practice of sports generally and of football specifically. Our analysis explains the time <b>at</b> which <b>these</b> <b>pictures</b> first appear as a consequence of developing possibilities and skills in ongoing photographic experimentation. This is illustrated by a case study of a football action photograph from the archives of the Noorthey Institute for boys in Voorschoten, dating from 1895 - 1897. There, conducting sports was seen as a way of enhancing the students’ physical and mental strengths, including improved study performance. It took place in an atmosphere of camaraderie among teachers and students, the latter acting as supervisors and teammates at the same time.

5000|$|One {{period of}} time in a woman's life where self-objectification happens {{excessively}} is during pregnancy. Magazines offer pictures of pregnant celebrities with golden skin, toned legs, and a perfectly rounded, [...] "cute" [...] pregnant belly. The photo-editing makes it seem real, and people start to think that is how they ought to look when they are pregnant. Looking <b>at</b> <b>these</b> perfect <b>pictures</b> results in pregnant women feeling worse about themselves and being incredibly self-conscious about their weight even though their weight gain is normal and necessary. They see themselves as not good enough, again, objectifying their identity to a body that needs to be perfect.

Three successive tests of free reconstruction of order indicated disparate effects of these conditions; random presentation produced significant forgetting of order in-formation across tests, whereas logical presentation produced no change in perfor-mance across tests. Whereas randomly presented stimuli produced both reliable inter-test recovery (reminiscence) and forgetting, neither result was observed following logi-cal presentation.

On {{the wall of the}} room where I was drinking a glass of beer with my wife and some friends hung an extremely comical coloured picture, divided into four sections in which ‘the Temperaments’ were represented and furnished with titles: ‘The Choleric’, ‘The Sanguine’, ‘The Melancholic’ and ‘The Phlegmatic’. The Choleric was on horseback. He had a long sword in his hand, which he was wielding fiercely in thin air; his eyes were bulging out of his head, his hair streamed wildly around his face, which was so distorted by rage and diabolical hate that I could not help bursting out laughing. The other three pictures were in the same style, and my friends and I were heartily amused by the naivety of the pictures, their exaggerated expression and their comic earnestness. But how strangely things can sometimes turn out! I, who had laughed aloud and mockingly <b>at</b> <b>these</b> <b>pictures,</b> returned constantly to them in my thoughts, and one fine day I realized that these shoddy pictures still contained a kind of core or idea and - just think! - even a musical undercurrent!

5000|$|As {{the world}} is {{an image of the}} living Aeon (tou zontos aionos), so is man an image of the pre-existent man of the anthrops proon. Valentinus, {{according}} to Clemens Alexandrinus (Valentini homil. ap. Clem. Strom. iv. 13, 92), spoke of the Sophia as an artist (zographos) making this visible lower world a picture of the glorious Archetype, but the hearer or reader would as readily understand the heavenly wisdom of the Book of Proverbs to be meant by this Sophia, as the 12th and fallen Aeon. Under her (according to Valentinus) stand the world-creative angels, whose head is the Demiurge. Her formation (plasma) is Adam created {{in the name of the}} Anthropos proon. In him thus made a higher power puts the seed of the heavenly pneumatic essence (sperma tes anothen ousias). Thus furnished with higher insight, Adam excites the fears of the angels; for even as kosmikoi anthropoi are seized with fear of the images made by their own hands to bear the name of God, i.e. the idols, so these angels cause the images they have made to disappear (Ep. ad amicos ap. Clem. Alex. Strom. ii. 8, 36). ... they say that Achamoth sketched these pictures in honor of the aeons. Yet they transfer this work to Soter as its originator who operated through Achamoth so as to present her as the very image of the invisible and unknown Father, she being invisible, of course, and unknown to the Demiurge, and in the same way he created this same Demiurge to correspond to Nus, the son. The Archangels, creations of the Demiurge, are models of the rest of the aeons. ... don't you agree that I should laugh <b>at</b> <b>these</b> <b>pictures</b> painted by such a lunatic painter?

40|$|Background: Problematic {{drinkers}} favour {{the processing}} of alcohol-related stimuli {{at the cost of}} other stimuli and also find it difficult to disengage their attention from these stimuli. This is indicative of an attentional bias towards alcohol. The goal {{of this study was to}} examine this bias in problematic drinkers with and without mild to borderline intellectual disability (MBID) using both eye tracking methodology and behavioural data (i. e. reaction time (RT) data). Method: Participants (N[*]=[*] 133) were divided into four groups based on (estimated) full scale intelligence quotient (IQ) and severity of alcohol use-related problems. The severity of substance use-related problems was assessed with the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT). The visual dot probe task was used to measure the attentional bias. We analysed both eye tracking data and behavioural data (i. e. RT data) of the visual dot probe task. Results: Problematic drinkers were not more likely than light drinkers to direct their attention towards pictures of alcoholic beverages, did not look <b>at</b> <b>these</b> <b>pictures</b> longer than light drinkers and did also not respond faster than light drinkers to probes replacing pictures of alcoholic beverages. However, the strength of the attentional bias varied profusely.

40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{indications}} for a high degree of similarity between grammars of different sign languages studied so far. These observations are almost exclusively based on the analysis of American, Western European and Australian sign languages. However, more recent research into Asian sign languages (cf. Zeshan, 2000) and African (village) sign languages (cf. Nyst, 2004; Nyst & Perniss, 2004; Schmaling, 2000) seems to challenge this assumption. Therefore a larger project was set up looking at the linguistic structures of a Western European sign language, i. e. Flemish Sign Language (VGT), and an African sign language, i. e. South African Sign Language (SASL) (cf. Akach et al., 2006; Akach et al., in press). The research presented here is part of that project. Aims and objectives In order to compare both sign languages we decided to focus on reference tracking. It thus becomes possible to deal with some of the currently debated matters in sign language research, viz. the position of gesture in sign languages and sign linguistics (Liddell, 2003; Schembri, et al, 2005) and the role of iconicity (Cuxac, 2000; Demey, 2005). The reference tracking devices we studied are: •	constructed action •	shifted attribution of expressive elements •	“classifier constructions” •	the use of space with pointing signs and/or indicating verbs •	aspects of word order •	a combination of some of these. There have been some small-scale studies in this domain both in SASL (Aarons & Morgan, 2003) and in VGT (Van Herreweghe & Vermeerbergen, 2003). The present study aims at expanding our understanding of these mechanisms in the two studied languages and in sign languages in general. We have also examined how some of the above mechanisms relate to the paradigm as proposed by Cuxac (1996; 2000) and Sallandre (2003) with respect to the use of “des Structures de Grande Iconicité” and mainly “des Transferts Situationnels” and “des Transferts Personnels”. Research Design It was decided to set up a cross-linguistic study involving the analysis of two comparable corpora of semi-spontaneous narratives. The elicitation materials used were sets of drawings forming five different short stories. Four VGT (near-) native signers (two male, two female) were asked to look <b>at</b> <b>these</b> <b>pictures</b> and to narrate the stories in Flemish Sign Language. Each signer was asked to recount the story in VGT to a Deaf addressee and the stories were videotaped. The procedure was replicated with four SASL (near-) native signers (two male, two female, of whom two black, one Indian and one white). Subsequently, the stories were transcribed and analysed. Results and Discussion The results bear out that there are remarkable similarities between both sign languages with regard to a number of the studied reference tracking devices. We suggest that this is related to the “de l’eau pétillante” nature of the data. There is a continuum between two different manifestations of sign language use with on the one end a form which makes maximum use of the possibilities offered by the visual-gestural modality (e. g. iconicity, use of space, simultaneity), called de “l’eau pétillante”, and on the other end a form more resembling oral language non-iconic sequential organisation, called “de l’eau plate” (Vermeerbergen, 2006). Vermeerbergen et al. (submitted) focussed on de l’eau plate of isolated declarative sentences in SASL and VGT which yielded a number of striking differences. However, when studying the sparkling water of narratives as in the present study the similarities between the two sign languages involved are very salient. status: publishe...|$|E
