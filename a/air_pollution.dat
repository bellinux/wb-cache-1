5|$|The smog catalyzed greater {{national}} {{awareness of}} <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> {{as a serious}} health problem and political issue. New York City updated its local laws on <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> control. Prompted by the smog, President Lyndon B.

30|$|For {{proposed}} CO 2 emission mitigation, using {{alternative fuels}} {{is one of}} the strategies to achieve the goal but their emissions are different from conventional fuels, for instance, CH 4 emission from compressed natural gas (CNG) and N 2 O emissions from ethanol, etc. (USEPA 2012). Therefore, other <b>air</b> <b>pollutions</b> are considered. The <b>air</b> <b>pollutions</b> of the LCT scenario in the transport sector are analyzed in terms of CO 2, CH 4, and N 2 O emissions. The CO 2 emissions are classified into two sources as CO 2 emissions from fossil fuels and biogenic-CO 2 from biofuels. The emission factors are adopted from IPCC (2006) and USEPA (2012).|$|R

5|$|According to the World Health Organization (WHO) Delhi was {{the most}} {{polluted}} {{city in the world}} in 2014. In 2016 WHO downgraded Delhi to eleventh-worst in the urban air quality database. According to one estimate, <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> causes the death of about 10,500 people in Delhi every year. During 2013–14, peak levels of fine particulate matter (PM) in Delhi increased by about 44%, primarily due to high vehicular and industrial emissions, construction work and crop burning in adjoining states. Delhi has the highest level of the airborne particulate matter, PM2.5 considered most harmful to health, with 153 micrograms. Rising <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> level has significantly increased lung-related ailments (especially asthma and lung cancer) among Delhi's children and women.
