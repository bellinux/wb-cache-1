25|$|As a cricketer he was {{the most}} talented player of my time, <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> {{extraordinary}} talents in every facet of cricket. In hindsight he probably didn't reach the heights that he should have, based on his cricket ability, but the guys who played with him and against him will recognise he was a fantastic player, who was dynamic in anything he did in cricket. When he was on he was unplayable. He bowled a swinging ball, he could hit the ball a mile, throw it like a bullet and he was a fantastic catcher either close to the wicket or in the outfield – a supreme cricketer. He was a very popular person, Gus, a bit of a larrikin and very much liked by everyone. He didn't take life all that seriously, played for the enjoyment of it.|$|E

[...] Following the film, and the standing ovation it received, Soderbergh appeared for a post program Q During the sometimes contentious conversation with the audience, in which Soderbergh alternated between defensiveness and modesty, the director categorized Guevara as [...] "a hard ass", to which one audience member yelled out, [...] "Bullshit, he was a murderer!" [...] The filmmaker settled down the crowd and explained, [...] "It doesn't matter whether I agree with him or not—I was interested in Che as a warrior, Che as <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> an ideology, who picked up a gun {{and this was the}} result. He died the way you would have him die. He was executed the way you would say he executed other people". Soderbergh ended the 1 am Q session by noting that he was [...] "agnostic" [...] on Che's standing, but [...] "loyal to the facts", which he insisted were all rigorously sourced.|$|E

[...] Joe Babinsack, writing for the Wrestling Observer, described the book as [...] "brutal, boisterous and definitely worth reading". Bruce Mitchell, writing for the Pro Wrestling Torch, described the book as [...] "hard-hitting, straightforward, and not very fancy", rating it [...] "one of the strongest professional wrestling books in a long while".

[...] While Gallagher has stated he did not intend [...] "Live Forever" [...] as a direct retort to Nirvana or their music (being a professed fan of the band), he contrasted the lives of Cobain and his band at that point, saying, [...] "Seems to me that here was <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> everything, and was miserable about it. And we had fuck-all, and I still thought that getting up in the morning was the greatest fuckin' thing ever, 'cause you didn't know where you'd end up at night.
