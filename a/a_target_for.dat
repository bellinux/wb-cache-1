5|$|A {{recession}} in the 1930s was halted by increasing international tensions as World War II loomed; Sheffield's steel factories were set to work manufacturing weapons and ammunition for the war effort. As a result, the city became <b>a</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> bombing raids, the heaviest of which occurred on the nights of 12 and 15 December 1940, {{now known as the}} Sheffield Blitz. More than 660lives were lost and many buildings destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Aigle {{returned}} to Woolwich in October 1852 {{where she was}} converted to a coal hulk and receiving ship. She moved to Sheerness in September 1869 and in the following August, she became <b>a</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> torpedoes before being sold and broken up in November 1870.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{its role}} in {{protecting}} genomic integrity and cell motility, MAPK15 {{has been identified as}} <b>a</b> potential <b>target</b> <b>for</b> cancer therapeutics. Additionally, given the putative role that MAPK15 plays in the regulation of ciliogenesis, it may be <b>an</b> ideal <b>target</b> <b>for</b> diseases related to human ciliary defects (often called ciliopathies).|$|R

5|$|As in {{the colonial}} period, the Pine Bush {{continued}} to be tapped for its natural resources, with water becoming <b>a</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> development. The Patroon Creek, roughly where three feeder streams joined {{in the heart of}} the Pine Bush along Albany's northern border, was dammed in 1850 to form Rensselaer Lake waterworks.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{differences}} in the metabolic pathways of NAD biosynthesis between organisms, such as between bacteria and humans, this area of metabolism is a promising area for the development of new antibiotics. For example, the enzyme nicotinamidase, which converts nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, is <b>a</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> drug design, as this enzyme is absent in humans but present in yeast and bacteria.|$|E

50|$|As {{its name}} suggests, its primary {{mission is to}} monitor {{variations}} in star light, which it does by observing <b>a</b> single <b>target</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{long period of time}} (up to 60 days).

5|$|During World War I, Ashford's {{importance}} as a transport hub and its location between {{the continent and}} London made it <b>a</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> aerial bombing. A bomb fell on the railway works on 25 March 1917, killing 61 people, while the town was a target in the Battle of Britain during World War II, including an attack on 15 September 1940.|$|E
5|$|In 1885 Resistance {{began to}} be used as <b>a</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> the testing of armour against the effects of torpedoes and gunfire. She was sold for scrap on 11 November 1898.

5|$|Like {{other large}} whales, the {{humpback}} was <b>a</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> the whaling industry. Once hunted {{to the brink}} of extinction, its population fell by an estimated 90% before a 1966 moratorium. While stocks have partially recovered, entanglement in fishing gear, collisions with ships and noise pollution continue to impact the population of 80,000.|$|E

25|$|The MQR-16A Gunrunner was an unguided rocket {{developed}} by Atlantic Research during the 1960s.

Proving successful, the rocket served in the United States military until the 1980s.|$|R
5|$|The French ironclad Armide was a wooden-hulled armored {{corvette}} {{built for}} the French Navy in the mid-1860s. Placed into reserve after completion, she was first mobilized for the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71. She {{spent the rest of}} her career in the Mediterranean and then in the Far East as flagship of the French squadrons there, until her decommissioning in 1880. Armide was use as <b>a</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> gunnery trials in 1886.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{returned}} to southeastern Texas in 1716, establishing several missions and a presidio {{to maintain a}} buffer between Spanish territory and the French colonial Louisiana district of New France. Twoyears later in 1718, the first civilian settlement in Texas, San Antonio, was established as a way station between the missions and the next-nearest existing settlement. The new town quickly became <b>a</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> raids by the Lipan Apache.|$|E

He made more than 100appearances for Gillingham and became <b>a</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> a number of larger clubs, eventually signing for Wolverhampton Wanderers in June 2007. He became a first-team regular for the club, helping them win promotion to the top flight in 2009. In August 2012, he joined West Ham United for an undisclosed club record fee. In September 2015, he joined Norwich City on loan {{until the end of the}} season, and made that move permanent in January 2016.|$|E

5|$|Bioluminescent {{organisms are}} <b>a</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> {{many areas of}} research. Luciferase systems are widely used in genetic {{engineering}} as reporter genes, each producing a different colour by fluorescence, and for biomedical research using bioluminescence imaging. For example, the firefly luciferase gene was used as early as 1986 for research using transgenic tobacco plants. Vibrio bacteria symbiose with marine invertebrates such as the Hawaiian bobtail squid (Euprymna scolopes), are key experimental models for bioluminescence. Bioluminescent activated destruction is an experimental cancer treatment. See also optogenetics which {{involves the use of}} light to control cells in living tissue, typically neurons, that have been genetically modified to express light-sensitive ion channels, and also see biophoton, a photon of non-thermal origin in the visible and ultraviolet spectrum emitted from a biological system.|$|E
5|$|Bordeaux was an {{important}} port for the German war effort, receiving {{a great deal of}} cargo, mostly raw materials, from overseas. It was also a major naval base, with huge submarine pens for U-boats. The Gironde estuary and Bordeaux had already been <b>a</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> the Allies. Operation Frankton was a 1942 commando raid targeting important shipping in the port. In January 1944, the Allies intercepted communications indicating that German commanders were concerned by the possibility of landings in the Bay of Biscay region of France. The next month, German naval and air units undertook anti-invasion exercises in the area. Ironside was intended to amplify these concerns.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1920s {{the rise}} in motor traffic had put {{pressure}} on the ferry's capacity. A proposed bridge between Shooter's Hill and East Ham was rejected as it would be too obvious <b>a</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> wartime bombings, and a third vessel was introduced instead. Because of the lack of a fixed crossing, the Thames became a psychological barrier for those living in the East End of London, who could only use a limited number of routes to cross the river, including the Woolwich Ferry. The lack of a suitable alternative route was instrumental in creating plans for what eventually became the Dartford Crossing further downstream.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, Liverpool's {{importance}} {{as a major}} port saw it become <b>a</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> the Luftwaffe and during the May Blitz of 1941, a heavy bomb exploded in the basement, {{on the eastern side}} of the building. The damage from the explosion was significant with the eastern wing being seriously damaged by fire. Nonetheless the building's structural integrity meant that much of the building could be re-occupied with only temporary repairs. In the aftermath of the war the building was fully restored; the cost of restoration exceeding the original construction costs.|$|E

He played in Luton's 2012 Conference Premier play-off Final 2–1 defeat at Wembley, coincidentally against York, on 20 May 2012. Lawless signed a one-year contract extension in July 2012, despite poor performances during the 2011–12 season making him <b>a</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> fans.|$|E
5|$|Epsilon Eridani is <b>a</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> planet finding {{programs}} {{because it}} has properties that allow an Earth-like planet to form. Although this system was not chosen as a primary candidate for the now-canceled Terrestrial Planet Finder, it was a target star for NASA's proposed Space Interferometry Mission to search for Earth-sized planets. The proximity, Sun-like properties and suspected planets of Epsilon Eridani have also made it the subject of multiple studies on whether an interstellar probe {{can be sent to}} Epsilon Eridani.|$|E
