40|$|This study {{captures the}} voices of school-based {{behavioral}} specialists who are employed across the state of Michigan to share how well schools and child welfare agencies communicate and collaborate to address the educational well-being of foster care children on their caseloads. This includes knowledge of federal policies and how they support and hinder communication across systems. Participants included a total of 249 K- 12 employed school psychologists, counselors, and social workers. Survey methodology was used and both inferential and narrative analyses revealed that these school practitioners were highly unaware of how to identify the foster care children in their schools, and what supports they need. The three groups of school-based professionals were similarly unaware, minimal communication is occurring with <b>outside</b> <b>agencies,</b> and they largely do not take initiative in reaching out to communicate and collaborate with community-based <b>agencies</b> <b>outside</b> the <b>school.</b> Despite that, collectively, the work of child welfare and education professionals could have a substantial impact on retention and the overall student performance {{of children who are}} living in out of home care. Implications of this lack communication and awareness are discussed. Recommendations to guide a national research agenda for advocacy and policy efforts are also identified...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} sosialisation {{of science and}} {{technology}} implies that the process of acquiring skills and knowledge related to science and techonology is broader than the formal schooling process. It encompasses also the nonformal and informal processes at home, industries and through other <b>agencies</b> <b>outside.</b> A comprehensive study was conducted between 1996 - 1999 to describe the status of teaching and learning {{of science and technology}} related subjects, the role of teachers, infrastructural and material support in teaching and learning science and technology. On the basis of the finding of the study, certain recommendations were proposed. These in turn, could become the basis of a standard for socialisation of science and technology. Selected administrators and key personels in education, were asked to evaluate the proposed standard and make changes when necessary. Based on the feedback and the degree of consensus reached, final statements were selected {{to be included in the}} standard which encompassed the following five aspects; objective and content of curriculum, the process of teaching and learning, the role of teachers, the facilities, equipments and materials, and the involvement of <b>agencies</b> <b>outside</b> the <b>school</b> system.

40|$|Many of the {{characteristics}} of effective physical education lessons have been discovered by sport pedagogy researchers by employing what has become known as the ecological or task structures perspective. The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe the task structures and ecology that existed in two consecutive 7 -day summer adventure camps run by an <b>agency</b> <b>outside</b> the <b>school</b> setting. Participants included two novice adventure educators (AEs) and 31 elementary and middle school-aged children. Data were collected using a number of qualitative techniques and were analyzed using standard interpretive methods. Five task structure systems were identified. The instructional and managerial systems were similar to those previously found in classrooms and school physical education except that parental chaper-ones were used to enforce the management system. The social system was similar to those previously observed within sport education and adventure education units within school-based physical education in that it mainly served to support the instructional and managerial systems rather than com-pete with them as in more traditional models of teaching. The exploratory and atmospheric systems had not previously been identified, were exten-sions of the instructional and social systems, and appeared somewhat unique to adventure education. Implications for training AEs are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how school restructuring can be promoted by <b>agencies</b> <b>outside</b> the <b>school.</b> The first part posits {{a framework for}} designing and analyzing external strategies to promote school restructuring. This framework distinguishes between strategies that are: (1) intended to initiate versus support school restructuring; (2) comprehensive versus focused; and (3) sustained versus episodic. Strategies are also distinguished according to their consistency, prescriptiveness, authority, and power. The next part {{provides an overview of}} current strategies and situates each strategy within the framework. It describes a range of available strategies for several different types of agencies: federal, state, and district agencies; national organizations; the courts; independent developers; businesses; and teacher unions. The analysis concludes that serious gaps and some contradictions exist among the strategies. Although two promising strategies are identified [...] the work of professional organizations in creating a general press for reform and in creating a vision [...] a national strategy for promoting school restructuring is absent. Without a national strategy, the multiple strategies taken simultaneously by many different agencies are not likely to add up to a comprehensive and coherent plan.

40|$|In 1906 {{cooperative}} education {{was established by}} Dean Herman Schneider of the University of Cincinnati. Since that time legislation has been passed, such as the Vocational Act of 1963 and the Amendments of 1968, which have played {{an important part in}} the adoption of cooperative office education programs in the schools. Prior to 1963 there were approximately 450 programs, and in 1969 - 70 there were approximately 2, 321 programs operating. Douglas, Blanford, and Anderson, in their book Teaching Business Subjects state that 2 ̆ 2 Cooperative education is a method of education that integrates learning experiences in the school with work experiences made available in some cooperating <b>agency</b> <b>outside</b> the <b>school.</b> 2 ̆ 22 The student alternates periods in school with periods in business, a practice which gives the student an opportunity to use skills already learned in the classroom. Cooperative education holds promise {{for the next few years}} when secondary education will be called upon to train more young people for more diverse professions and occupations than at any previous time. A problem in education is to train for the needs of today and the future. These needs can be met by educators and businessmen working together in programs such as {{cooperative education}}. Cooperative education is not the only answer, but it strengthens classroom instruction with practice on the job. This plan requires the student 2 ̆ 7 s employment to be related to the instruction received in the classroom. For example, a secretarial student is placed in an office, instead of cooking in a hamburger stand. The job should be diversified enough that the student will have varied experiences. An ideal situation would be where the work increases in difficulty and responsibility as the student progresses in the related class...|$|R

40|$|Summative {{assessment}} {{has been}} a contentious issue in educational circles for several decades, particularly high-stakes assessment events which arise at various junctures of the school cycle, especially those {{at the end of}} it. The French Baccalauréat and English A-Levels and their numerous clones throughout the francophone and anglophone worlds are household names and represent milestone events in people’s lives, as their outcomes are principal determinants of young people’s future prospects. These examinations are external––they are devised, conducted and processed by <b>agencies</b> <b>outside</b> the <b>schools,</b> usually ministerial examination units. As such, they act as ‘blind’ arbiters of student achievement, providing the proverbial ‘level playing field’ which ensures the comparability of outcomes. In the pyramidal school structures of yesteryear, examinations acted as filters, regulating the progression of pupils to subsequent tiers of formal education. Exit points occurred from primary school level up, from where unsuccessful candidates could enter the labour force and/or embark on occupationally specific further education and training. With the modernisation of the labour market and an ever-higher social demand for access to higher levels of formal education, the filtering function of examinations at lower levels of schooling has been gradually eroded, while burgeoning numbers of students at the upper secondary level have brought about reforms that include curricular diversification and sometimes radical overhauls of terminating assessment systems (including the modification and, in some instances, abandonment of external examinations). This edited volume brings together the experiences of twenty examination systems {{from around the world to}} show how these dynamic entities have adapted over time to the changing context of schooling. Following an introduction by Stephen P. Heyneman of World Bank repute, there are sixteen chapters presenting Country Case Studies, which have been written up under common subheadings, thereby highlighting the comparative nature of the work and facilitating cross-referencing. The subsequent four chapters elaborate on the theme of ‘external examinations beyond national borders’, including a contribution by the International Baccalaureate Organisation. A defining feature of the work is the attention it pays to what it calls the ‘nuts and bolts’ of external examinations, from question-setting to grading procedures. These are, it is argued, instrumental in nurturing and maintaining public confidence in external examinations. The book will be of immense value to people involved in educational policy studies, especially strategic educational planning, as well as those directly concerned with formal assessment. The work has been written to appeal to a wide audience of informed persons––it is accessible to teachers and interested laypeople, as well as to academics. [Book Synopsis...|$|R
