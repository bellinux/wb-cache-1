25|$|The third {{match was}} between Crowbar and Terry Funk for the WCW Hardcore Championship. The match started when Funk ambushed Crowbar backstage. They fought inside a truck, and Funk sent Crowbar through {{a table with}} a hip toss. Crowbar {{attacked}} Funk with <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>door,</b> and slammed a door into Funk's head. Funk performed a low blow, and slammed the door into Crowbar's head repeatedly. Funk handcuffed Crowbar, and attacked him with the car door and a steel chair. Crowbar fought back with the chair, and performed a slingshot splash to Funk through a table. Funk fought back with chair shots, and pinned Crowbar after a piledriver on the car door to win the match and the title.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT- ABSTRACT-The {{automobile}} technology had {{its birth}} since 18 th century. Tremendous changes {{took place in}} the design of automobiles such as aerodynamics, green fuels, electronic control unit. In the past decades the new design for the modern <b>car</b> <b>doors</b> were introduced. The modern <b>car</b> <b>doors</b> are less convenient during parking because of the space for the parking vehicle is less and congested. This design also creates a problem during heavy traffic situations. <b>A</b> new <b>car</b> <b>door</b> concept is designed mainly focused to avoid these problems. This also helps to avoid accidents during opening and closing of <b>car</b> <b>doors.</b> This mechanism includes a roller bearing and aluminium rail with a lock mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Over {{the last}} one decade {{there has been an}} increas-ing {{emphasis}} on driver-assistance systems for the automotive domain. In this paper we report our work on designing a camera-based surveillance system embedded in <b>a</b> “smart ” <b>car</b> <b>door.</b> Such <b>a</b> camera is used to monitor the ambient environment outside the car – e. g., the presence of obstacles such as approaching cars or cyclists who might collide with the <b>car</b> <b>door</b> if opened – and automatically control the <b>car</b> <b>door</b> operations. This is an enhancement to the currently available side-view mirrors which the driver/passenger checks before opening the <b>car</b> <b>door.</b> The focus of this paper is on fast and robust image processing algorithms specifically targeting such <b>a</b> smart <b>car</b> <b>door</b> system. The requirement is to quickly detect traffic objects of interest from gray-scale images captured by omnidirectional cameras. Whereas known algorithms for object extraction from the image processing literature rely on color information and are sensitive to shadows and illumination changes, our proposed algorithms are highly robust, can operate on gray-scale images (color images are not available in our setup) and output results in real-time. To illustrate these, we present a number of experimental results based on image sequences captured from real-life traffic scenarios. I...|$|R
