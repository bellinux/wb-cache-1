Using count data regression models in which we control for labour market experience, various demographic factors, and occupation, we find that job stability did not decrease, but if anything increased, between 1974 and 1994. Our finding suggests that labour market inflexibility {{is an important factor in}} explaining the European unemployment problem. ...|$|E

30|$|During the {{financial}} crisis, employment {{stability in the}} observed industries was accomplished through short-time work and working time accounts, whereas temporary agency workers and fixed-term contract holders were made redundant.

Yet, peripheral workplaces contribute to better labor market access and additional job creation, which, in turn, generates additional income from work (Eichhorst and Tobsch 2014). Today, within the manufacturing sector, many temporary contracts are transformed into long-term contracts. Since firm-specific skills can only be achieved after longer periods of employment, those workplaces often reveal an above-average tenure (Eichhorst et al. 2013).|$|E
40|$|Purpose – This paper {{proposes to}} use changes in intra-industry {{specialization}} indicators {{over the period}} 1996 - 2008 to assess the potential for factor <b>adjustment</b> <b>pressures</b> that may arise in the USA if the proposed USA-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement (TPA) is implemented. Results {{show that there is}} considerable scope for intra-industry specialization between Colombia and the USA. The TPA should result in a larger increase in US exports to Colombia than US imports from Colombia, because Colombian exporters face much lower tariffs in the USA market than do US exporters in the Colombian market. Given the tariff asymmetry, scope for intra-industry specialization, the relatively large size of the US market, and the small number of US industries that are likely to encounter factor <b>adjustment</b> <b>pressures,</b> the USA should ratify the agreement immediately. Design/methodology/approach – Changes in intra-industry specialization indicators are used to identify US industries that may face factor <b>adjustment</b> <b>pressures</b> {{as a result of the}} proposed USA-Colombia TPA. Findings – There is considerable scope for intra-industry specialization between Colombia and the USA. Few US industries will be candidates for factor <b>adjustment</b> <b>pressures.</b> Practical applications – The USA should ratify the TPA.

40|$|The OPEC Cartel's {{spectacular}} {{success in}} raising real world oil prices {{over the past}} decade has brought about substantial net resource transfers from energy poor to energy rich countries within the world economy. In accomodating these resource transfers both energy exporting and importing economies have been confronted with <b>adjustment</b> <b>pressures.</b> Of course the intensity and nature of these <b>adjustment</b> <b>pressures</b> has differed substantially between countries according to amongst other things a country's resource endowment, its net trade position with respect to oil and other energy based products and the degree of openness of its economy to world trade. Our concern in this paper is with quantifying the short and medium term <b>adjustment</b> <b>pressures</b> imposed on the South Korean economy assuming continued increases in real world oil prices. The results are derived from a multisectoral general equilibrium model. A feature of the model is its design flexibility and simple solution algorithm. We exploit this in the present study by comparing results for a range of experiments to accommodate differing assumptions about the Korean macroeconomic environment, labour market behaviour and Korean export demand. While the numerical results refer specifically to Korea, it is to be hoped that by rationalising them in terms of the underlying structural features inherent in the Korean economy the paper provides some guidance on the sorts of <b>adjustment</b> <b>pressures</b> likely to confront energy poor open economies assuming a continued movement in the world terms of trade towards oil. ...|$|R

Furthermore, one has to note that stability and flexibility of employment are shared unequally across sectors, occupations and socio-economic groups. Still, {{it is true that the}} secondary segment of non-standard jobs faces major employment risks and acts as an additional buffer that eases the <b>adjustment</b> <b>pressure</b> on the core.

40|$|The large OPEC-engineered {{real world}} oil price {{increases}} {{of the early}} and late 1970 ?s have set in train, via a highly integrated international trade and finance system, significant resource transfers from energy-poor to energy-rich countries. In accommodating these resource transfers both energy exporting and importing economies have been confronted with <b>adjustment</b> <b>pressures.</b> In {{the case of the}} former group, these <b>adjustment</b> <b>pressures</b> have arisen from the need for these economies to accommodate a favourable shift in their foreign terms of trade, ostensibly by way of a redirection of resources from the international to the domestic account, thus permitting higher real national income. For energy-poor countries however the required adjustment process has much less palatable consequences for economic growth and the real income aspirations of the populations. Our concern in this paper is with a subset of the latter group - the so-called oil-poor developing countries. We focus in considerable detail on four such economies; Kenya, South Korea, Ivory Coast and Turkey. As well as representing various levels of oil 'poorness' these countries exhibit interesting differences in resource endowments, the industrial composition of their gross domestic products, the oil intensity of their industrial production technologies, the skill composition of their labour forces, their openness to world trade and their commodity composition of exports and imports.

Only occasionally are welfare losses calculated from trade liberalization, although such losses are quite possible in theory, as a large recent literature has shown. The second typical conclusion is that calculated <b>adjustment</b> <b>pressures</b> from trade liberalization are considerably higher than implied in most commentary, and higher also than estimates from traditional models. <b>Adjustment</b> <b>pressures</b> describe stimuli for workers to shift activities, for firms to grow or die, for industries to expand or contract, and for trading-partner shares to be altered. ...|$|R

As a result, incomes have been depressed, and people have migrated to areas with more and better job opportunities. In {{a high proportion of}} rural communities, out-migration has been so heavy as to cause substantial losses of population.

We consider the options of integration policy and major shifts in regional gravity centers and trade dynamics, respectively; moreover, new findings with respect to the role for trade in the context of growth accounting are integrated in the analysis. We emphasize that regional integration intensifies structural change – the emergence of larger regional integration areas creates new options for outsourcing and offshoring.

40|$|Medium-terms {{shifts in}} the {{structure}} of world demand affect the sectoral composition of domestic output, trade and employment. A sustained reduction of global current-account imbalances implies a decline in the share of household consumption in aggregate demand in the United States and the opposite development in China. The net effect of these adjustments for the world economy would be deflationary and yet insufficient for the unwinding of global imbalances. It would also cause sizeable adverse employment impacts in the world economy as a whole. A multilaterally coordinated rebalancing that would also include an increase in the share of household consumption in aggregate demand of developed country surplus economies would reduce these adverse effects. Apart from the countries undertaking rebalancing, developing countries in East and South-East Asia are likely to face the greatest <b>adjustment</b> <b>pressure</b> from global rebalancing. ...|$|E

40|$|Continuing {{rapid growth}} of China and India can be {{expected}} to raise incomes in Russia, but also to put <b>adjustment</b> <b>pressure</b> on Russian firms. The impacts of the {{rapid growth of}} China and India on the Russian economy are explored by examining a baseline projection using a global general equilibrium model, and then assessing the implications of higher-than-expected growth in China and India. The authors find that a major source of benefits to Russia is likely to be terms-of-trade improvements associated with higher energy prices - a quite different channel of effect from that for many developing countries that benefit primarily through expanded opportunities to trade directly with these emerging giants. Taking into account the likely improvements in the quality and variety of exports from China and India, the gains to Russia increase substantially. The expansion of the energy sector and the contraction of manufacturing and services are a sign of a Dutch disease effect that will increase the importance of policies to encourage adaptation to the changing world environment.

40|$|After the {{collapse}} of Lehman Brothers, a rapid and far-reaching shrinkage of international banks' assets {{with a focus on}} foreign claims took place. For the largest 67 German banking groups, we find that both their characteristics and behavior in the pre-crisis episode had repercussions for the crisis period. Above all, prior non-traditional banking activities - proxied by the relevance of securities and noninterest income - resulted in balance sheet contraction in the crisis. While, from 2002 to mid- 2008, a disproportionately high growth rate in profits to assets is found to be indicative of too much risk taking, both high average income and a strong balance sheet expansion in the pre-crisis period are found to be positive per se. In contrast, a high average income or a strong growth in assets in just the last {{three and a half years}} before the outbreak of the crisis put balance sheets during the crisis under <b>adjustment</b> <b>pressure.</b> During the crisis, short-term wholesale funding proved to be a disadvantage, while good capital endowment (core Tier 1 capital to RWA ratio), deposit funding and strong affiliate presence abroad had a stabilizing impact.

40|$|Starting from October 2009, {{redemption}} {{of government}} securities {{was transferred to}} the real-time gross settlement system (VIBER) developed for the settlement of time-critical transfers and operated by MNB. This step ensures that the settlement of redemption is performed in the clearing system where the financial performance related to the issue of government securities has been carried out for a long time. Channelling redemption to VIBER has achieved its goal, as it allowed the issuer (the Hungarian state) to use the funds stemming from the issue for the purposes of repayments and manage its liquidity in a simpler and more flexible way. In addition, this change has not caused a significant liquidity shortfall for participants in either of the two payment systems. This resulted in clearly less liquidity demand in the financial settlement processes related to the issue of government securities and redemption upon expiry.

However, occlusion of the rollers should be adequately performed and this can be adjusted mainly by two methods: static and dynamic. To investigate how the Brazilian perfusionists adjust arterial roller pumps in their services and evaluate the application of a Device to Assist Calibration (DAC) that facilitates roller adjustment by the dynamic calibration method. We installed a roller pump with accessories to perform adjustment by drop rate (static calibration) and dynamic calibration methods during the XXVIII Brazilian Congress of Extracorporeal Circulation. Perfusionists were asked to adjust the roller pump according to the procedure they usually do in their service. After each <b>adjustment</b> <b>pressure</b> was measured by dynamic calibration method with DAC. The research was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of UNICAMP, Nº 1144 / 2010. There were 56 perfusionists in this study. Pressure average of 56 measurements of dynamic calibration was 434 ± 214 mmHg; 76 % of measurements were within the recommended range for the use of the dynamic calibration method (between 150 and 500 mmHg). Brazilian perfusionists tend to adjust roller pumps with less occlusive settings. The amplitudes of the dynamic calibration pressure tend to be smaller for more experienced perfusionists because their skills increase with time.
