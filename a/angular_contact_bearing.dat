40|$|A vacuum spiral orbit {{rolling contact}} tribometer (SOT) {{was used to}} {{determine}} the relative lifetimes of several unformulated space liquid lubricants. The lubricants tested included a synthetic hydrocarbon (Pennzane 2001 A), three perfluoropolyethers (Krytox 143 AC, Fomblin Z 25, and Brayco 815 Z), three silahydrocarbons (a tri, a tetra, and a penta) and a polyalphaolefin (Nye PAO- 100). The SOT simulates the ball motions in an <b>angular</b> <b>contact</b> <b>bearing</b> and tribochemically degrades microgram quantities of lubricant. Test failure is determined when a preset friction coefficient is exceeded. Relative lifetime (orbits/micro-g) is defined as the number of ball orbits to failure divided by the amount of lubricant on the ball. Conditions included 10 to 200 rpm rotational speed, approximately 50 micro-g lubricant, an initial vacuum < 1. 3 x 10 (exp - 6) Pa, room temperature (approximately 23 C), a mean Hertzian stress of 1. 5 GPa, and 440 C stainless steel specimens. Lubricated lifetimes from longest to shortest were Pennzane 2001 A, the silahydrocarbons and the PAO- 100, 143 AC, ZI- 5, and then 815 Z. Relative lifetimes compare favorably to full-scale vacuum gimbal bearing tests. The effect of varying the mean Hertzian stress on the lifetime of some of the lubricants was examined...|$|E

The double row <b>angular</b> <b>contact</b> ball <b>bearing</b> supports combined axial and radial loads, provides high shaft stiffness and limits {{the movement of}} the pump impeller, shaft, and seal. Recent studies, tests, and analysis of double row ball bearings operating in various conditions have both confirmed and contradicted some long held opinions, regarding the application of these bearings in centrifugal pumps. The studies indicate the Conrad type (e. g., without filling slot) double row <b>angular</b> <b>contact</b> ball <b>bearings</b> operate at lower temperatures than the maximum capacity failing slot type double row bearings at 3, 600 rpm rotational speed. These lower operating temperatures result in longer bearing and lubricant life and greater pump reliability. The filling slot of the modern design maximum capacity double row bearing has been redesigned so that it seldom has direct influence n the bearing life and performance when correctly applied in the pump. Double row <b>angular</b> <b>contact</b> ball <b>bearings</b> having moderate to high contact angle and normal axial internal clearance operate at lower temperature and have better internal motion than <b>bearings</b> having lower <b>contact</b> angles and greater clearances in typical pump application conditions. The results and conclusions of the studies made with the double row <b>angular</b> <b>contact</b> ball <b>bearings</b> are discussed.

In order {{to investigate the}} physics behind the dispersion and test future design changes, a detailed finite element model of the PHALANX gun was developed. This is the first finite element model of the gun ever. The normal modes of a single barrel have been matched favorably with those of a real barrel. This model {{has been used to}} calculate the normal modes of vibration of the whole gun in order to predict the motion of the complex system. Barrel tip displacement, which plays a critical role in the dispersion pattern, was determined after applying the periodic firing excitation force and damping. Its motion corresponds well to the 2 mradian dispersion. In addition, its first mode of vibration at 14 Hz appears to be significant in the analysis of the dispersion data. This analysis has focused attention on certain components of the gun, such as the double <b>angular</b> <b>contact</b> <b>bearing,</b> which may be a leading cause of the dispersion pattern. Finally, this gun model can also support design changes such as the addition of barrel restraints or the proposed new barrels and their effect on dispersion predicted prior to any actual hardware tests or procurement orders.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} and {{experimental study of}} hydrodynamic lubrication between surfaces which touch, nominally, at a single point has been carried out. The first theoretical study involves the most general case of two surfaces of any curvature and having any directions of sliding and rolling motions. The theory {{has been applied to}} derive the dependence of oil film thickness between hypoid gears upon the design parameters. The second theoretical study is concerned with the hydrodynamic lubrication of a sphere spinning about its point of contact with a cylindrical groove. This motion is a simulation of one element of the kinematic behaviour of a ball in an <b>angular</b> <b>contact</b> <b>bearing</b> and calculations have been made to show the relative effect of this motion in the generation of a hydrodynamic film under these conditions. Experimental investigations have been made, using a crossed cylinders machine, into the nature of the oil film under conditions of elastohydrodynamic lubrication at point contacts. The optical interference technique has been used to derive the dependence of film thickness between cylinders of steel and glass upon speed and load using a medium viscosity mineral oil as a lubricant. The factors which affect the overall shape of the film under these conditions have also been investigated. Finally, results are presented of a direct comparison between the optical and capacitive methods of measuring the film thickness at point contacts...|$|E
40|$|A {{decoupled}} {{slow speed}} friction torque {{model has been}} developed to predict the running torque of a double-arched <b>angular</b> <b>contact</b> <b>bearing</b> when operating as a four-point, {{as well as a}} two-point contact bearing. The load distribution model from Amasorrain et al. (2003) and the kinematics model developed by Leblanc and Nelias (2007) have been combined after ignoring centrifugal and gyroscopic effects, a valid assumption for slow speed operation. Results from the model are compared with previous literature data, as well as with tests done on a specially-developed friction torque rig. The comparison with the literature results was done for two specific cases: (i) when only one out of the two contact lines in the four-point contact bearing is active (effectively creating a two-point contact bearing); and (ii) where both contact lines in the four-point contact bearing are active. Further, the comparison was done with a custom-built friction torque rig with FAG QJ 309 bearings, again for two cases: (i) bearings mounted with a specific clearance (two-point contact); and (ii) bearings mounted with larger size balls to obtain interference (four-point contact). All tests were performed at low speeds. The sliding friction, which is an important input to the friction torque model, is carefully measured on ball-on-plate test using the same interface roughness, speed and contact pressure conditions as seen in the QJ 309 friction test. The model comparison with experimental results is covered. The comparison is found to be encouraging, with the RMS difference being less than 7 % between the model and experimental data for a four point contact...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, a novel {{approach}} is presented for blade loss simulation of an aircraft gas turbine rotor mounted on rolling element bearings with squeeze film dampers, seal rub and enclosed in a flexible housing. The modal truncation augmentation (MTA) method provides an efficient tool for modeling this large order system with localized nonlinearities in the ball bearings. The gas turbine engine, which is composed of the power turbine and gas generator rotors, is modeled with 38 lumped masses. A nonlinear <b>angular</b> <b>contact</b> <b>bearing</b> model is employed, which has ball and race degrees of freedom and uses a modified Hertzian contact force between the races and balls and for the seal rub. This combines a dry contact force and viscous damping force. A flexible housing with seal rub is also included whose modal description is imported from ANSYS. Prediction of the maximum contact load and the corresponding stress on an elliptical contact area between the races and balls is made during the blade loss simulations. A finite-element based squeeze film damper (SFD), which determines the pressure profile of the oil film and calculates damper forces for any type of whirl orbit is utilized in the simulation. The new {{approach is}} shown to provide efficient and accurate predictions of whirl amplitudes, maximum contact load and stress in the bearings, transmissibility, thermal growths, maximum and minimum damper pressures {{and the amount of}} unbalanced force for incipient oil film cavitation.

Traditionally, two types of tests have been used: accelerated and full-scale. Accelerated tests are rapid, economical, and provide useful information for gross screening of candidate lubricants.

5000|$|An <b>angular</b> <b>contact</b> ball <b>bearing</b> uses axially {{asymmetric}} races. An {{axial load}} passes {{in a straight}} line through the bearing, whereas a radial load takes an oblique path that tends to want to separate the races axially. So the angle of contact on the inner race is the same as that on the outer race. <b>Angular</b> <b>contact</b> <b>bearings</b> better support [...] "combined loads" [...] (loading in both the radial and axial directions) and the contact angle of the bearing should be matched to the relative proportions of each. The larger the contact angle (typically in the range 10 to 45 degrees), the higher the axial load supported, but the lower the radial load. In high speed applications, such as turbines, jet engines, and dentistry equipment, the centrifugal forces generated by the balls changes the contact angle at the inner and outer race. Ceramics such as silicon nitride are now regularly used in such applications due to their low density (40% of steel). These materials significantly reduce centrifugal force and function well in high temperature environments. They also tend to wear in a similar way to bearing steel—rather than cracking or shattering like glass or porcelain.|$|R

40|$|The {{bearings}} in the {{air motors}} of modern jet aircraft engines must operate dry in hostile conditions at temperatures up to 500 ° C, where the thrust races in the actuators operate at temperatures up to 300 ° C. One of the few metallurgical combinations which can function efficiently under these conditions is martensitic stainless steel on tungsten carbide. The work described was initiated to isolate the wear mechanisms of two such steels in contact with tungsten carbide at temperatures up to 500 ° C. Experiments were carried out on <b>angular</b> <b>contact</b> <b>bearings</b> similar to these used in service, where both rolling and sliding is present and also for pure sliding conditions using a pin-on-disc apparatus. Wear measurements of the bearings were obtained with wear rates, friction and surface temperatures from the pin-on-disc machine {{for a series of}} loads and speeds. Extensive X-ray diffraction analysis was carried out on the wear debris, with also S. E. M. analysis and hardness tests on the worn surfaces along with profilometry measurements of the disc. The oxidational parameters of the steel were obtained from measurements of oxide growth rates by ellipsometry. Three distinct mechanisms of wear were established and the latter two were found to be present in both configurations. These involve an oxidational-abrasive mechanism at loads below 40 N with pin surface temperatures up to about 300 °C, with the mechanism changing to severe wear for higher loads. As the temperature increases a third wear mechanism appears due to transfer of relatively soft oxide films to the steel surface reducing the wear rate. Theoretical K factors were derived and compared with experimental values which were found to be in good agreement for the severe wear mechanism. The pin-on-disc experiments may be useful as a screening test for material selection, without the considerable cost of producing the <b>angular</b> <b>contact</b> <b>bearings...</b>|$|R

50|$|All {{parts of}} a bearing are subject to many design constraints. For example, {{the inner and outer}} races are often complex shapes, making them {{difficult}} to manufacture. Balls and rollers, though simpler in shape, are small; since they bend sharply where they run on the races, the bearings are prone to fatigue. The loads within a bearing assembly are also affected by the speed of operation: rolling-element bearings may spin over 100,000 rpm, and the principal load in such a bearing may be momentum rather than the applied load. Smaller rolling elements are lighter and thus have less momentum, but smaller elements also bend more sharply where they contact the race, causing them to fail more rapidly from fatigue. Maximum rolling-element bearing speeds are often specified in 'nDm', which is the product of the mean diameter (in mm) and the maximum RPM.

40|$|Department of Mechanical EngineeringHigh-speed {{machining}} is {{a particularly}} important industrial process during which material is removed using a cutting tool with rotational and translational motion. The rotating unit is {{a major part of}} the machine tool, and is composed of a bearing, spindle, and associated surrounding components. During machining, the rotating unit is exposed to large mechanical loads, as well as significant heat generated due to friction in the bearings, which can lead to thermal deformation and failure of the spindle. To achieve reliability of the spindle system, an accurate description of the thermo-mechanical behavior of the system is useful to predict the thermal effects during the design phase. Existing methods to simulate the thermo-mechanical behavior of rotating parts require significant computational resources because of the geometric complexity of the models. In this dissertation we discuss a finite element method (FEM) approach for calculating the thermo-mechanical behavior of the rotating unit using the commercially available software package ANSYS. We modeled the heat generated in <b>angular</b> <b>contact</b> ball <b>bearings,</b> and applied the heat transfer of a rotating cylinder to calculate thermal load. We explored the characteristics of the spindle system, specifically <b>angular</b> <b>contact</b> ball <b>bearings,</b> which are commonly used in machine tools. We carried out a geometric simplification process for <b>angular</b> <b>contact</b> ball <b>bearings</b> out to overcome the divergence phenomenon in the FEM simulation, which may occur because of contact between rolling elements and bearing races. We used Matrix 27 elements to simulate the stiffness/damping characteristics of ball bearings, and used the ‘close gap’ function in the contact elements to implement heat transfer between the inner and outer races of the bearing. We used the thermal contact conductance to describe heat transfer between the surfaces of the bearing using the close gap function. We also determined a constant describing the thermal contact conductance for several types of bearing using a parametric simulation study, and compared the results with experimental data to determine the value of the constant. We determined the fraction of the heat flux to the inner and outer races empirically via comparisons with experimental data. Next, we carried out simulations of the rotating unit using the results of this simulation. We analyzed the thermo-mechanical behavior of the rotating unit, and compared the simulated temperature distribution and thermal deformation of the spindle tip with experimental data.
