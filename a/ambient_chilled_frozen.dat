40|$|In present {{research}} work, effect of edible and biodegradable protein dispersion coatings prepared from same fish and low cost fish (croaker fish) on <b>chilled</b> and <b>frozen</b> stored seer fish fillets on microbiological quality was studied. Washed meat of seer fish and croaker fish was converted into gels by lowering its pH with acetic acid. The gel dispersions were utilized as edible protein coatings after adjusting its pH to 3. 5 and apparent viscosity to 1 Pa s {{to enhance the}} shelf life of seer fish fillets during <b>chilled</b> and <b>frozen</b> storage. Seer fish fillets were coated with dispersions prepared from same fish or from low cost fish and microbiological quality changes occurred in <b>chilled</b> and <b>frozen</b> stored seer fish fillets, with or without protein dispersion coatings were studied. Protein dispersion coated seer fish fillets showed significantly enhanced microbiological quality as compared to fillets without coating and fillets with water glazing during frozen storage period of six months. No significant difference was observed in microbiological quality of seer fillets coated with protein dispersion prepared from same fish or from low cost fish. Hence, both these coatings {{can be used as}} natural and eco-friendly protection for <b>chilled</b> and <b>frozen</b> stored seer fish fillets...|$|R
40|$|Seafood is an {{important}} food source for many. Consumers should be entitled to an informed choice, and there is growing concern about correct composition labeling of seafood. Due to its high price, {{it has been shown}} to be vulnerable to adulteration. In the present study, we focus on moisture levels in seafood. Moisture and crude protein contents of <b>chilled</b> and <b>frozen</b> cod, pangasius, salmon, shrimp and tilapia purchased from various retail outlets in the Netherlands were examined by reference methods and the values of which were compared with the reported data from other studies in literature. Significant differences in proximate composition were determined for different species and between <b>chilled</b> and <b>frozen</b> products of the same species. Pangasius products showed the highest moisture contents in general (86. 3 g/ 100 g), and shrimp products revealed the largest differences between <b>chilled</b> and <b>frozen</b> products. Comparison with literature values and good manufacturing practice (GMP) standards exposed that, generally, <b>chilled</b> pangasius, <b>frozen</b> pangasius and frozen shrimp products presented considerably higher moisture and lower crude protein/nitrogen contents than those found in other studies. From the GMP standards, extraneous water was estimated on average at 26 g/ 100 g chilled pangasius product, and 25 and 34 g/ 100 g product for frozen shrimp and pangasius products, respectively...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} on the shelf-life of rotary and solar tunnel dried SIS products under different packaging and storage conditions. Organoleptically dried products were found in good condition after a storage period of 60 days in <b>ambient</b> and <b>chilled</b> conditions. The moisture content, TVB-N value and bacterial load slightly increased during 60 days of storage in <b>ambient</b> and <b>chilled</b> conditions. The changes in moisture content and bacterial load were faster in ambient temperature than in chilled storage condition whereas changes in TVB-N value was higher in chilled condition than in ambient temperature. The initial moisture content was in the range of 13. 71 % to 22. 84 %. After 60 days of storage in <b>ambient</b> and <b>chilled</b> condition the moisture content of dried products was in the range of 15. 09 % to 25. 11 % and 14. 49 % to 25. 01 %, respectively. The initial TVB-N value was in the range of 10. 64 to 17. 52 mg/ 100 g and after 60 days of storage in <b>ambient</b> and <b>chilled</b> condition, TVB-N value was in the range of 29. 00 to 34. 82 mg/ 100 g and 31. 41 to 39. 11 mg/ 100 g, respectively. The initial bacterial load was in the range of 1. 91 x 10 super(8) to 2. 84 x 10 super(8) and after 60 days of storage in <b>ambient</b> and <b>chilled</b> condition, the bacterial load was in the range of 6. 2 x 10 super(8) to 1. 8 x 10 super(9) and 5. 75 x 10 super(7) to 5. 05 x 10 super(8) CFU/g, respectively.

They measure from a few millimeters to two metres in length. They do occur in all colour forms and those beautifully coloured ones are in great demand for marine aquariums.

40|$|Two {{benchmarking}} {{surveys were}} created {{to collect data on}} the performance of <b>chilled,</b> <b>frozen</b> and mixed (<b>chilled</b> and <b>frozen</b> stores operated from a single refrigeration system) food cold stores with the aim of identifying the major factors influencing energy consumption. The volume of the cold store was found to have the greatest relationship with energy use with none of the other factors collected having any significant impact on energy use. For chilled cold stores, 93 % of the variation in energy was related to store volume. For frozen stores, 56 % and for mixed stores, 67 % of the variation in energy consumption was related to store volume. The results also demonstrated the large variability in performance of cold stores. This was investigated using a mathematical model to predict energy use under typical cold store construction, usage and efficiency scenarios. The model demonstrated that store shape factor (which had a major impact on surface area of the stores), usage and to a lesser degree ambient temperature all had an impact on energy consumption. The work provides an initial basis to compare energy performance of cold stores and indicates the areas where considerable energy saving are achievable in food cold stores. © 2013 Elsevier B.
