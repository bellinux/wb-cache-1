This extreme heterogeneity, which left only few and sometimes one single number for a given variable related to the nutritive value of pangola, precluded a quantitative analysis of data.

40|$|Glycine betaine (betaine) {{acts as a}} methyl group donor in transmethylation {{reactions}} in organisms. Betaine occurs in numerous vertebrate tissues as an osmolyte, ensuring osmoprotection. Betaine is safe for piglets at the maximum supplementation rate of 2 000 mg/kg complete feed with a margin of safety below 5. This conclusion is extended to all pigs and extrapolated to all <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> and <b>categories.</b> The use of betaine anhydrous and betaine hydrochloride as feed additives up to a supplementation rate of 2 000 mg betaine/kg complete feed is unlikely to pose concerns for consumer safety. In the absence of data, betaine anhydrous and betaine hydrochloride should be considered hazardous by inhalation, as irritant to skin, eyes and mucous membranes, and skin sensitisers. The supplementation of feed with betaine anhydrous and betaine hydrochloride does not pose a risk to the environment. Betaine {{has the potential to}} become efficacious in all <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> and <b>categories</b> when administered via feed or water for drinking. Betaine anhydrous and betaine hydrochloride are considered as nutritionally equivalent sources of betaine. The FEEDAP Panel made some recommendations on (i) introduction of a maximum content for supplemental betaine in complete feed and water for drinking; (ii) avoidance of simultaneous use of betaine in feed and water for drinking; (iii) avoidance of simultaneous inclusion of betaine and choline chloride in premixtures; and (iv) protection of users when handling the additives...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{research}} and legislation {{carried out in}} the last decades, we are still in progress to fulfil the public concerns about the definition of sustainable production standards as regards the welfare of farm animals. The assessment of animal welfare on-farm is nowadays one of the outstanding issues for several reasons: 1) identify risk factors still present at the farm level for livestock welfare, 2) find solutions to overcome welfare problems, 3) define minimum requirements for all the farm <b>animals</b> <b>species</b> and <b>categories</b> or refine the exiting recommendations, 4) create certification schemes for labelling welfare friendly farm animal products. Ideally a standardized welfare assessment protocol should be based on a multidisciplinary approach but, for feasibility reasons, most of the proposed monitoring schemes have been based mainly on the evaluation of farm housing and facilities. The Welfare Quality® research consortium {{is currently working on a}} new assessment tool largely based on valid and reliable measures recorded by clinical and behavioural observation of the animals. Differing from the existing protocols for animal welfare assessment, the Welfare Quality ® scheme aims to be a valuable support to farmers and the animal industry in their efforts to improve the welfar...|$|R
40|$|Manganese, an {{essential}} trace element, functions as an enzyme activator {{and is a}} constituent of several enzymes. Primary signs of manganese deficiency are impaired growth, skeletal abnormalities, depressed reproductive function, ataxia of the newborn and faults in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Manganese chelate of amino acids, hydrate is considered a safe source of manganese for all animal species/categories, provided that the current maximum total contents of manganese authorised in feed are respected. Dietary manganese {{does not appear to}} cause any adverse effects in consumers at usual intake levels; manganese intake resulting from the consumption of tissues and products of animal origin is low compared with the intake resulting from the consumption of food of plant origin. The use manganese chelate of amino acids, hydrate, does not result in higher manganese deposition in edible tissues and products than that resulting from commonly used inorganic sources. The use of the additive in animal nutrition is of no concern for the safety of consumers, provided that the current maximum total contents of manganese authorised in feed are respected. Handling the additive is a possible hazard to the respiratory tract and the health of users; in the absence of adequate data regarding irritancy to the skin and eyes and dermal sensitisation, the additive should be considered as a potential skin and eye irritant and, owing to its residual peptide component, as a skin/respiratory sensitiser. The use of manganese chelate of amino acids, hydrate, in animal nutrition for all <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> is not of concern for the environment, provided that the current maximum total contents of manganese authorised in feed are respected.

40|$|The safety {{assessment}} of the additive {{is based on the}} separate consideration of its two constituents, bentonite and sepiolite. The currently authorised maximum contents for bentonite and sepiolite when used individually (20   000 mg/kg complete feed) are considered safe for all <b>animal</b> <b>species.</b> In consequence, Toxfin® Dry would be safe for all <b>animals</b> <b>species</b> and <b>categories</b> up to a maximum concentration of 20   000 mg/kg complete feed. Bentonite and sepiolite, in common with other clays, are not absorbed to any measurable extent. Consequently, {{it is unlikely that the}} consumption of edible tissues/products of treated animals would expose the consumer to harmful amounts of residues of any chemical component derived from Toxfin® Dry. The FEEDAP Panel considers that there is no concern for the safety of consumers of food products derived from animals fed diets containing the additive. Dust generated from Toxfin® Dry during normal handling has the potential to expose the whole of the respiratory tract of users to potentially harmful substances (bentonite, sepiolite and crystalline silica) for which no safe levels of exposure have been identified. Measures must be taken to limit exposure of users to dust. In the absence of data for sepiolite, it would be prudent to treat ToxFin® Dry as a skin and eye irritant and a skin sensitiser. Bentonite and sepiolite are naturally occurring clays widely distributed in the environment. Therefore, it is not expected that the use of the additive in animal nutrition would adversely affect the environment. Since only one in vivo study in chickens has been provided, the FEEDAP Panel considers that there is insufficient evidence to conclude on the efficacy of the additive as a substance for reduction of contamination of feed with mycotoxins...|$|R
40|$|The {{additive}} formaldehyde is an {{aqueous solution}} containing 37 % formaldehyde and 14 % methanol. It {{is intended for}} use in all <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> at concentrations between 68 and 680 mg active substance/kg complete feed. Free and reversibly bound formaldehyde is readily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and joins the pool of endogenous formaldehyde. It is rapidly oxidised to formic acid further on to carbon dioxide and water. Formaldehyde is a carcinogen by inhalation. While local irritation is expected to strongly promote carcinogenesis, lower local concentrations of formaldehyde are known to produce DNA adducts. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel deems it prudent not to consider the exposure to non-irritant concentration as totally riskless. Moreover, {{on the basis of}} the present knowledge, a causal association between formaldehyde exposure and leukaemia cannot be ruled out. The FEEDAP Panel estimated the oral intake of formaldehyde of consumers from food of animal origin to be 4 mg per person per day. A reliable additional exposure of consumers to formaldehyde from supplementing feedingstuffs cannot be calculated. However, the FEEDAP Panel considers that the proposed use of formaldehyde as a feed additive would not increase consumer exposure and consequently would not pose an additional risk for the consumer. A safe feed concentration for all <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> and <b>categories</b> could not be determined. Formaldehyde is a strong irritant, a potent skin and respiratory sensitiser. Measures should be taken to ensure that the respiratory tract, skin and eyes of any person handling the product are not exposed to any dust, mist or vapour generated by the use of formaldehyde. The use of formaldehyde in animal nutrition is not expected to pose a risk for the environment. Formaldehyde in concentrations between 340 and 680 mg/kg feed (compound feed and/or feed material) has the potential to be an efficacious preservative...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{iron chelate}} of amino acids, hydrate, as source of iron is {{considered}} safe for all animal species/categories when used {{up to the}} currently authorised maximum content of total iron in complete feed, {{with the exception of}} bovines and poultry for which the maximum tolerated level is 450 mg/kg complete feed, and pets, for which the maximum tolerated level is 600 mg/kg complete feed. The FEEDAP Panel is not in the position to derive a maximum safe iron concentration in feed for horses or fish. Consumption surveys include iron-containing foodstuffs of animal origin. Since the supplementation of animal feed with iron-containing compounds has not essentially changed during the last decades, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that the iron levels in food of animal origin used in exposure scenarios originated from animals fed iron-supplemented diets. Since iron chelate of amino acids, hydrate, will be used as a substitute for other iron compounds, its use in animal nutrition would not modify consumer exposure to iron. The additive should be considered as a skin, eye and respiratory irritant and, owing to its residual peptide component, as a skin/respiratory sensitiser. Considering the high background concentration of iron in soil and water, the supplementation of feed with iron chelate of amino acids, hydrate, is not expected to pose an environmental risk. Iron chelate of amino acids, hydrate, is an effective source of iron for all <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> and <b>categories.</b> The FEEDAP Panel recommends that the maximum iron contents in complete feed be reduced as follows: bovines and poultry, 450 mg Fe/kg; and pets, 600 mg Fe/kg...|$|R
40|$|Ferrous {{sulphate}} heptahydrate is safe when supplied up to {{a maximum}} iron content per kilogram complete feedingstuff of 450 mg for bovines and poultry, 500 mg for ovines, 600 mg for pets, and 750 mg for other species/categories, except horses and fish; for piglets up to one week before weaning a maximum of 250 mg Fe/day is considered safe. Because of insufficient data, the FEEDAP Panel {{is not in a}} position to derive a maximum safe iron concentration in feed for horses or fish; as a provisional measure, the current value (750 mg/kg) could be maintained. The values for total dietary iron for pigs, ovines, horses, fish and other species/categories (except poultry, bovines and pets) are in line with those currently authorised. Iron from ferrous sulphate heptahydrate is unlikely to modify the iron concentration in edible tissues and products of animal origin. Consumer exposure in the EU is not associated with a risk of excess iron intake to the general population. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel does not foresee any concern for consumer safety resulting from the use of ferrous sulphate heptahydrate in animal nutrition, provided that the maximum iron content in complete feedingstuffs is respected. Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate is an irritant and corrosive to the skin, eyes and respiratory tract; thus, handling of the additive poses a hazard to the user/worker. Considering the high background concentration of iron and sulphur in soil and water, the supplementation of feed with ferrous sulphate heptahydrate is not expected to pose an environmental risk. Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate is an effective source of iron for all <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> and <b>categories.</b> The FEEDAP Panel recommends that the currently authorised maximum iron content in complete feed be reduced for bovines and poultry from 750 to 450 mg Fe/kg, and for pets from 1250 to 600 mg Fe/kg...|$|R
