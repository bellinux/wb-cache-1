5|$|Affeldt was not {{expected}} to make the Kansas City Royals' roster in 2002, but he {{was added to the}} bullpen after he had an 0.64 ERA and fourteen strikeouts (to go with just two walks) in fourteen innings in Spring training. His major league debut came on April 6 against the Chicago White Sox. He pitched two innings, giving up three hits and <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> a 140 loss. On April 24, Affeldt picked up his first major league win by pitching 3.2 innings of relief in an 82 win over the Detroit Tigers.|$|E
5|$|After {{ending the}} 2008 season with 15 {{scoreless}} innings, Greinke started off 2009 by not allowing <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> his first 24 innings, {{which meant that}} for 39 innings in a row, he had not given up a run. Greinke was named American League(AL) Pitcher of the Month for April, his five wins, 0.50 ERA and 44 strikeouts all tops in the Majors. On August 25, Greinke struck out 15 batters, breaking Mark Gubicza's team record for strikeouts in a single game. On August 30, Greinke had a one-hit complete game against the Seattle Mariners.|$|E
5|$|After the election, Roosevelt {{continued}} to promote progressive ideals, a New Nationalism, much to Taft's dismay. Roosevelt attacked his successor's administration, arguing that its guiding principles were {{not that of}} the party of Lincoln, but those of the Gilded Age. The feud continued on and off through 1911, {{a year in which}} there were few elections of significance. Wisconsin Senator La Follette announced a presidential run as a Republican, and was backed by a convention of progressives. Roosevelt began to move into a position for <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> late 1911, writing that the tradition that presidents not run for a third term only applied to consecutive terms.|$|E

5|$|As word {{increased}} of Bayh's intentions, {{political scientists}} opined on the detractions of a run. Citing {{the fact that}} his eight years as governor may be nullified by its distance in time and that his visibility in the Senate was low, critics pondered whether moderate voters may be more inclined to line with possible candidate Mark Warner of Virginia. However, this criticism subsided once Warner decided against <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> October 2006.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{were grouped}} with England, South Africa and the West Indies. In the first match against England, Poulton ran out Laura Marsh, {{triggering}} {{the loss of}} the last four wickets without the addition of <b>a</b> <b>run,</b> <b>in</b> six balls, leaving 15 deliveries unused. In pursuit of 105 for victory, Poulton top-scored for Australia with 23 from 28 balls, helping to stabilise the innings after the Australians had fallen to 2/10. However, she fell at 4/45, bowled by Holly Colvin, and eventually, Rene Farrell was run out going for the winning run from the third last ball available, leaving the scores tied.|$|E

5|$|Considered by {{baseball}} insiders {{and historians}} as an unlucky pitcher, Warhop {{had a career}} 69–92 win–loss record, but with a 3.12 earned run average while playing for mostly second division Highlanders/Yankees teams. Of his 92 losses, the Yankees did not score <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> 23, and he holds the MLB record for losing the most 1–0 games with five in 1914.

5|$|After Quantrill {{became a}} free agent, Mota became the setup man for Gagné in 2004. He started {{the season with}} eight {{straight}} scoreless games. From June 27 to July 16, he did not allow <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> 10 straight games. On July 29, he started a career-high five-game winning streak {{when he got a}} win by pitching two scoreless innings in a 2–1 victory over the San Francisco Giants. He was the winning pitcher when he pitched two scoreless innings in an 8–5 victory over the Anaheim Angels on July 3 in a game notable for Gagné getting the final save of his 84 straight converted save chances. On July 30, a day before the trade deadline, Mota had a 2.14 ERA in 52 games. That day, he was traded to the Florida Marlins with Juan Encarnación and Paul Lo Duca for Hee-seop Choi, Brad Penny, and Bill Murphy.|$|E

5|$|By 1933, Hutton was {{regularly}} {{opening the}} batting for the Pudsey St Lawrence first {{team in the}} Bradford Cricket League. By close observation of his opening partner, the former Yorkshire county batsman Edgar Oldroyd, Hutton further developed his batting technique, especially in defence. The local press soon identified Hutton as a player of promise, particularly after he scored a match-winning 108 not out in the Priestley Cup. Senior figures within Yorkshire cricket identified him as a potential successor to Percy Holmes as an opening partner to Sutcliffe; {{at this stage in}} his career, Hutton was also considered a promising leg spin bowler. In the 1933 season Hutton was selected for the Yorkshire Second Eleven. Although he failed to score <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> either of his first two innings, over the season he scored 699 runs at an average of 69.90. Yorkshire appointed Cyril Turner as Hutton's mentor; Hedley Verity and Bowes also offered Hutton guidance in his early career.|$|E
5|$|During the streak, the Elias Sports Bureau {{changed its}} {{criteria}} for the official consecutive scoreless innings record for starting pitchers from including fractional innings in which one or two outs had been recorded to counting only complete scoreless innings. Since the streak was active {{at the end of}} the 1988 season, it would have spanned two separate seasons if Hershiser had pitched any additional scoreless innings to begin the next year. However, he yielded <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> his first inning of the 1989 season, thus ending the streak. The streak only includes innings pitched in the regular season, excluding eight scoreless innings Hershiser pitched to start Game 1 of the 1988 National League Championship Series on October 4 (unofficially extending his streak to 67 combined innings). Although he completed the ninth inning in each start, the streak's final game lasted 16 innings, of which he only pitched the first ten. Thus, Hershiser did not match Drysdale's record of six consecutive complete game shutouts. Like Drysdale's streak, the penultimate game of Hershiser's streak was a Dodgers–Giants game that featured a controversial umpire's ruling that saved the streak.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the arrival}} of Emmanuel Adebayor on loan, Benzema went unused in two {{consecutive}} league matches in February 2011. He returned to the starting lineup on 19 February and embarked on <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> which he scored ten goals in eight matches. Included in those ten goals were doubles in three straight matches against Málaga, Racing de Santander and Hércules, {{as well as a}} goal in the first leg of Madrid's Round of 16 tie against former club Lyon. The strike against his hometown club was the 100th goal of his professional career, and also the first goal for Real Madrid at the Stade de Gerland in six years, though despite the honours associated with netting the goal, Benzema did not celebrate out of respect for his former club.|$|E

Advancing at <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> the face of heavy canister fire, the 22nd reached the ravine. However, in that position they were subjected to severe musket and artillery fire from the Confederates, and so they pushed forward to the Norfolk Railroad cut, forcing the Confederates back to their entrenchments. In the assault on Petersburg, the 22nd lost seven killed and 14 wounded.|$|E

5|$|Martinez {{began working}} as a model {{in order to further}} her {{professional}} wrestling career.
