5|$|In The Kingdom of This World, Carpentier {{creates a}} {{succession}} of characters that engage in very similar actions. This repetition, a stylistic tool that resembles baroque writings, constructs a cyclical pattern in the novel which depicts the author's social views. The succession of characters (as well <b>as</b> <b>places)</b> that replace each other without fully developing on their own (or blocked from developing, in a sense) represent Carpentier's view of the social context in which forces are preventing characters from developing.|$|E

5|$|Heathen rites {{often take}} place in non-public spaces, {{particularly}} in a practitioner's home. In other cases, Heathen places of worship have been established on plots of land specifically purchased for the purpose; these can represent either a hörg, which is a sanctified place within nature like a grove of trees, or a hof, which is a wooden temple. The Heathen community has made various attempts to construct hofs {{in different parts of}} the world. In 2014 the Ásaheimur Temple was opened in Efri Ás, Skagafjörður, Iceland, while in 2015 a British Heathen group called the Odinist Fellowship opened a temple in a converted 16th-century chapel in Newark, Nottinghamshire. Heathens have also adopted archaeological sites <b>as</b> <b>places</b> of worship. For instance, British practitioners have assembled for rituals at the Nine Ladies stone circle in Derbyshire, the Rollright Stones in Warwickshire, and the White Horse Stone in Kent. Swedish Heathens have done the same at Gamla Uppsala, and Icelandic practitioners have met at Þingvellir.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Atlanta, Georgia's capital city, {{underwent}} significant {{economic and social}} change. To serve a growing economy based on manufacturing and commerce, many people left the countryside to relocate in Atlanta, often in primitive housing. Employment conditions in the city included child labor, a 66-hour work week, low wages, and unregulated and unsafe work sites. Men from the traditional and paternalistic rural society felt it degrading that their womenfolk were forced into the city to work in factories. Mixed gender workplaces were seen <b>as</b> <b>places</b> for potential corruption.|$|E

5|$|As late as 1795, the {{population}} of Massachusetts was nearly 95% of English ancestry. During the early and mid 19th century, immigrant groups began arriving in Massachusetts in large numbers; first from Ireland in the 1840s; today the Irish and part-Irish are the largest ancestry group in the state at nearly 25% of the total population. Others arrived later from Quebec as well <b>as</b> <b>places</b> in Europe such as Italy, Portugal, and Poland. In the early 20th century, a number of African Americans migrated to Massachusetts, although in somewhat fewer numbers than many other Northern states. Later in the 20th century, immigration from Latin America increased considerably. Over 156,000 Chinese Americans made their home in Massachusetts in 2014, and Boston hosts a growing Chinatown accommodating heavily traveled Chinese-owned bus lines to and from Chinatown, Manhattan in New York City. Massachusetts also has large Puerto Rican, Dominican, Haitian, Cape Verdean and Brazilian populations. Boston's South End and Jamaica Plain are both gay villages, as is nearby Provincetown, Massachusetts on Cape Cod.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{begins in}} 1566, {{and five years}} later the bridge is completed, {{together}} with a caravanserai (or han). The bridge replaces the unreliable ferry transport that was once {{the only means of}} traversing the river and comes to represent an important link between the Bosnia Eyalet {{and the rest of the}} Ottoman Empire. The bridge is built by serfs, who intermittently stage strikes and sabotage the construction site in protest against the poor working conditions. The Ottomans respond harshly, impaling the one caught saboteur. The bridge is wider across the middle portion, known as the gate (or kapija), and this section becomes a popular meeting place. Every important moment in the lives of the local residents comes to revolve around the bridge, with Christian children crossing it to be baptized on the opposite bank, and children of all religions playing around it. As time progresses, legends develop around the history of the bridge. The locals tell of two Christian infants who were buried alive inside the bridge to placate the fairies (vile) that thwart its construction. They come to regard two holes on the side of the bridge <b>as</b> <b>places</b> where the infants' mothers would come to suckle them while they were entombed. About a century later, the Habsburg Monarchy reclaims much of Central Europe and the northern Balkans from the Ottomans, triggering a crisis within the empire. Due to lack of state funds, the caravanserai is abandoned and falls into disuse. The bridge, on the other hand, stands for centuries without maintenance because of how well it was constructed. The residents of Višegrad—Turks, Serbs, Sephardic Jews, and Roma—stand in solidarity with one another during the Drina's regular floods.|$|E
5|$|Other leisure {{facilities}} include the Keelman's Way, a 14-mile designated cycle and walking route which stretches from Wylam station to Bill Quay and which passes along the riverbank at Felling Shore. Named from the keelboats used to transport coal {{from the various}} collieries in the area, the route was extended into Newburn in 2012 when a Gateshead blue plaque was laid in memory of its creator, Councillor Roy Deane. Also at Felling Shore, at Green Lane, is Friar's Goose marina and the adjacent Friar's Goose Water Sports Club, a privately owned and increasingly popular club predominantly attended by middle-aged patrons who undertake various activities such as sailing, yachting and angling on the River Tyne. Felling Cricket Club has been based at High Heworth Lane at Felling since 1961 and compete locally, {{and there are a}} wide selection of public houses, including the Wheatsheaf at Carlisle Street, the Blue Bell in Victoria Square, the Portland Arms at Split Crown Road and the Pear Tree Inn at Sunderland Road which are all locally listed <b>as</b> <b>places</b> of special local interest.|$|E

40|$|During {{the recent}} decades {{the concept of}} place has been treated with {{intensity}} and frequency in architectural discourse. Much {{has been said about}} such issues as the sense of place, place versus placelessness, the loss of place and so on. This study surveys the concept of <b>place</b> <b>as</b> a theoretical issue of architecture in terms of two themes: <b>place</b> <b>as</b> substance and <b>place</b> <b>as</b> context. In light of these two themes, three further themes, called 'the immediate contextualism', 'towards an urban architecture' and 'spirits of place', are examined. The survey of "the immediate contextualism" starts from a shift from <b>place</b> <b>as</b> substance to <b>place</b> <b>as</b> context in the changing ideals of architecture {{during the second half of}} the 20 th century. With the survey of the themes of 'towards an urban architecture' and 'the spirits of place', however, a re-shift from the <b>place</b> <b>as</b> context to <b>place</b> <b>as</b> substance becomes necessary, since what it is about with the first shift from <b>place</b> <b>as</b> substance to <b>place</b> <b>as</b> context on an architectural plane is, in the last analysis, not so much an issue of <b>place</b> <b>as</b> context as an issue of <b>place</b> <b>as</b> substance on an urban plane, namely, our cities. In regard to the changing nature of our cities, the study ends with an argument for open-minded concepts of place to rise to the challenge of new places...|$|R
