5|$|The Mk 8 Rangekeeper was an {{electromechanical}} {{analog computer}} whose function was to continuously calculate the gun's bearing and elevation, Line-Of-Fire (LOF), {{to hit a}} future position of the target. It did this by automatically receiving information from the director (LOS), the FC Radar (range), the ship's gyrocompass (true ship's course), the ship's Pitometer log (ship's speed), the Stable Vertical (ship's roll and pitch), and the ship's anemometer (relative wind speed and direction). Also, before the surface action started, the FTs made manual inputs for the average initial velocity of the projectiles fired out of the battery's gun barrels, and air density. With <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>information,</b> the Rangekeeper calculated the relative motion between the ship and the target. It then could calculate an offset angle and change of range between the target's present position (LOS) and future position {{at the end of}} the projectile's time of flight. To this bearing and range offset, it added corrections for gravity, wind, Magnus effect of the spinning projectile, earth's curvature, and coriolis effect. The result was the turret's bearing and elevation orders (LOF). During the surface action, range and deflection Spots and target altitude (not zero during Gun Fire Support) were manually entered.|$|E

25|$|To draw an {{algebraic}} curve, it {{is important}} to know the remarkable points and their tangents, the infinite branches and their asymptotes (if any) and the way in which the arcs connect them. It is also useful to consider the inflection points as remarkable points. When <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>information</b> is drawn on a sheet of paper, the shape of the curve usually appears rather clearly. If not, it suffices to add a few other points and their tangents to get a good description of the curve.|$|E
25|$|By storing <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>information</b> {{the vendor}} can {{determine}} the customer needs very precisely whenever a customer requests a product or an update. As already stated the vendor can also easily inform the customer about some adaptations the customer needs to make to its configuration in order to let the product function properly. Another advantage of storing this information in a system {{is that it will}} ease the process of online delivery. The checking of the configuration needs and constraints can all be done automatically when a customer does a request.|$|E
25|$|Quantum physics {{does not}} allow us to access <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>information</b> directly, though. A {{measurement}} will yield only one of all possible values, destroying all others. If not for the no cloning theorem, we could first measure f(x) without measuring x, and then make a few copies of the resulting state (which is a superposition of states all having the same f(x)). Measuring x on these states would provide different x values which give the same f(x), leading to the period. Because we cannot make exact copies of a quantum state, this method does not work. Therefore, we have to carefully transform the superposition to another state that will return the correct answer with high probability. This is achieved by the quantum Fourier transform.|$|E

25|$|He {{compiled}} an eight-volume Geographia covering {{what was}} known about the earth. The {{first part of the}} Geographia is a discussion of the data and of the methods he used. As with the model of the solar system in the Almagest, Ptolemy put <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>information</b> into a grand scheme. He assigned coordinates to all the places and geographic features he knew, in a grid that spanned the globe (although most of this has been lost). Latitude was measured from the equator, as it is today, but Ptolemy preferred to express it as the length of the longest day rather than degrees of arc (the length of the midsummer day increases from 12h to 24h as you go from the equator to the polar circle). He put the meridian of 0 longitude at the most western land he knew, the Canary Islands.|$|E
25|$|The next {{task is to}} form a {{site plan}} and then use it to help decide the method of excavation. Features dug into the natural subsoil are {{normally}} excavated in portions to produce a visible archaeological section for recording. A feature, for example a pit or a ditch, consists of two parts: the cut and the fill. The cut describes {{the edge of the}} feature, where the feature meets the natural soil. It is the feature's boundary. The fill is what the feature is filled with, and will often appear quite distinct from the natural soil. The cut and fill are given consecutive numbers for recording purposes. Scaled plans and sections of individual features are all drawn on site, black and white and colour photographs of them are taken, and recording sheets are filled in describing the context of each. <b>All</b> <b>this</b> <b>information</b> serves as a permanent record of the now-destroyed archaeology and is used in describing and interpreting the site.|$|E
25|$|Research {{advanced}} {{so quickly}} {{that the need for}} an up-to-date checklist became apparent. Mary Parke (1902–1981), who was a founder member of the British Phycological Society, produced a preliminary checklist of British marine algae in 1953, corrections and additions of this were published in 1956, 1957 and 1959. In 1964 M.Parke and Peter Stanley Dixon (1929–1993) published a revised check-list, a second revision of this was produced in 1968 and a third revision in 1976. Distribution was added to the checklist in 1986 with G.R.South and I.Tittley's A Checklist and Distributional Index of the Benthic Marine Algae of the North Atlantic Ocean. In 2003 A Check-list and Atlas of the Seaweeds of Britain and Ireland was published by Gavin Hardy and Michael Guiry with a revised edition in 2006. This shows how rapidly knowledge of algae, at least in the British Isles, advanced. First efforts had been made by interested biologists and people capable of identifying the algae, this required books using the botanical names. Botanical keys to identify the plants then developed, followed by checklists. As more information was brought to light by interested workers, some volunteers, the checklists were improved and eventually a mapping scheme brought together <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>information.</b> The same pattern of knowledge developed with birds, mammals and flowering plants, though to a different time-scale and knowledge {{in other parts of the}} world has developed to this degree.|$|E

500|$|The {{diagnosis}} of toothache can be challenging, {{not only because}} the list of potential causes is extensive, but also because dental pain may be extremely variable, and pain can be referred to and from the teeth. Dental pain can simulate virtually any facial pain syndrome. However, the vast majority of toothache is caused by dental, rather than non-dental, sources. Consequently, the saying [...] "horses, not zebras" [...] has been applied to the differential {{diagnosis of}} orofacial pain. That is, everyday dental causes (such as pulpitis) should always be considered before unusual, non-dental causes (such as myocardial infarction). In the wider context of orofacial pain, all cases of orofacial pain may be considered as having a dental origin until proven otherwise. The diagnostic approach for toothache is generally carried out in the following sequence: history, followed by examination, and investigations. <b>All</b> <b>this</b> <b>information</b> is then collated and used to build a clinical picture, and a differential diagnosis can be carried out.|$|E

2500|$|The most studied trace and isotopic {{signatures}} are strontium due to {{the same}} charge and similar ionic radius to calcium; however, scientists can study multiple trace elements within an otolith to discriminate more specific signatures.

[...] This tool can measure a variety of trace elements simultaneously. [...] A secondary ion mass spectrometer can also be used. [...] This instrument can allow for greater chemical resolution but can only measure one trace element at a time.

With Hamburg and actors Hopkins and James Woods, Stone flew to Washington, D.C. and interviewed the surviving members of Nixon's inner circle: lawyer Leonard Garment and Attorney General Elliot Richardson. He also interviewed Robert McNamara, a former Secretary of Defense under the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. The director also hired Alexander Butterfield, a key figure in the Watergate scandal who handled the flow of paper to the President, as a consultant {{to make sure that the}} Oval Office was realistically depicted, former deputy White House counsel John Sears, and John Dean, who made sure that every aspect of the script was accurate and wrote a few uncredited scenes for the film. Butterfield also appears in a few scenes as a White House staffer. To research their roles, Powers Boothe, David Hyde Pierce and Paul Sorvino talked to their real-life counterparts, but J.T. Walsh decided not to contact John Ehrlichman because he had threatened to sue after reading an early version of the script and was not happy with how he was portrayed.
