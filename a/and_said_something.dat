5|$|Ike {{began to}} fear that word of his {{possible}} cooperation had leaked, threatening to compromise his standing among the Cowboys. Undercover Wells Fargo Company agent M. Williams suspected a deal, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> to Ike, who was fearful that other Cowboys might learn of his double-cross. Ike now began to threaten Wyatt and Doc Holliday (who had learned of the deal) for apparently revealing Ike's willingness to help arrest his friends.|$|E
2500|$|Representative Smith {{told the}} Investigative Subcommittee that Representative Miller {{specifically}} threatened {{to work against}} his son {{if he did not}} change his vote. Representative Smith’s recollection was that Representative Miller [...] "came up <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> like, I haven't been involved in this campaign before, but if you don't change your vote, I'll get involved, and I'll make sure Brad isn't elected." ...|$|E
2500|$|The second show I {{ever saw}} of the Descendents {{was at the}} Dancing Waters in San Pedro. They broke into the set and he was playing guitar so hard and so angry that his pants fell down. He was an odd character, for sure. I can {{remember}} standing in line at a Misfits show {{and all of a}} sudden he just sat down on the ground and started holding his head like his ears were ringing or something, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> to the effect of [...] "What am I doing here? Where am I?" [...] So that was Frank.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Cope's eyes glistened, <b>and</b> he <b>said</b> <b>something</b> huskily {{of being}} glad that Alfred {{could think of}} it.|$|R

2500|$|On March 17, 2007, Plame {{testified before}} the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. She was asked how she learned of Novak's {{reference}} to her in his column. Plame told the committee [...] "I found out {{very early in the}} morning when my husband came in and dropped the newspaper on the bed and said, 'He did it'.... We had indications in the week prior that Mr. Novak knew my identity and my true employer. And I of course alerted my superiors at the agency, and I was told, don't worry; we'll take care of it. And it was much to our surprise that we read about this July 14.... I believe, and this is what I've read, that the then-spokesman, Mr. Harlow, spoke directly with Mr. Novak <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> along the lines of, don't go with this; don't do this. I don't know exactly what he said, but he clearly communicated the message that Mr. Novak should not publish my name." ...|$|E
2500|$|With Aukerman away at college, the Descendents added Ray Cooper as both {{singer and}} second guitarist. They {{performed}} with this lineup, and occasionally as a quintet when Aukerman would make return visits to Los Angeles. Stevenson {{pushed for the}} band to tour, which Navetta and Lombardo were against: [...] "Bill kind of sat down with me and Frank <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> {{to the effect of}} we were at a point where we needed to grow by going on the road", Lombardo later said. [...] "Frank said no, and I had to say no also, so he said he had to leave the band and we were both kind of bummed out. I don’t think Frank even believed him at first. That was a bad scenario." [...] Navetta, Lombardo, and Cooper tried to start a new band, the Ascendants. [...] "We played one show", said Lombardo. [...] "Frank played in his underwear, and I don’t mean boxers. It was all a disaster, it was sad, for me anyway." [...] Navetta ultimately quit the band by setting all of his musical equipment on fire and moving to Oregon, where he became a full-time fisherman.|$|E

6000|$|The {{man made}} several efforts to answer, <b>and</b> finally <b>said</b> <b>something</b> that to Alfred sounded like [...] "Zane," [...] then {{he fell to}} the ground unconscious.|$|R
6000|$|... "She refused--refused me," [...] faltered Dave. [...] "She {{was very}} sweet <b>and</b> kind; <b>said</b> <b>something</b> about being my sister--I don't {{remember}} just what--but she wouldn't have me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well;--no; I can't {{say that}} he did. I told him I should see you {{as a matter of}} course, <b>and</b> he <b>said</b> <b>something</b> rough,--about your being an ass." ...|$|R

6000|$|The speaker hacked a bough {{from his}} pine. [...] "He was like--as though he wasn't awake. He didn't seem {{to listen to}} what I had to say. <b>And</b> he <b>said</b> <b>something</b> of--love." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "He was {{so excited}} that I waited till he had taken his seat again, <b>and</b> then <b>said</b> <b>something</b> {{indifferent}} <b>and</b> soothing; but he struck the tiny table with his colossal fist and went on.|$|R
6000|$|Mohegan {{pointed toward}} Elizabeth, who, forgetting her danger, had sunk {{back to a}} {{projection}} of the rock {{as soon as she}} recognized the sounds of Edwards’ voice, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> with <b>something</b> like awakened animation: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] {{said his}} sister, [...] "I {{strongly}} suspect something {{wrong about the}} boys.

6000|$|...
