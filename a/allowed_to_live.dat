5|$|Bahá'u'lláh was banished by Sultan Abdülâziz a {{final time}} in 1868 to the Ottoman penal colony of `Akká, in present-day Israel. Towards {{the end of}} his life, the strict and harsh {{confinement}} was gradually relaxed, and he was <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in a home near `Akká, while still officially a prisoner of that city. He died there in 1892. Bahá'ís regard his resting place at Bahjí as the Qiblih to which they turn in prayer each day.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} about Dylan, a {{depressed}} college student who attempts suicide. He survives due to unlikely events, but is soon visited by a demon who explains he spared Dylan's life. In exchange, Dylan will be <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> one more month for every person he kills. Brubaker said he chose to make the character young {{because he wanted to}} include the optimism of youth. The comic examines the consequences of vigilante violence and its effects on Dylan’s loved ones. The story debuted to mostly positive reviews. Some reviewers felt it was too similar to Brubaker and Phillips' previous collaborations.|$|E
5|$|Upon Umar's {{arrival in}} Jerusalem, a pact known as The Umariyya Covenant was composed. It {{surrendered}} {{the city and}} gave guarantees of civil and religious liberty to Christians in exchange for jizya. It was signed by caliph Umar {{on behalf of the}} Muslims, and witnessed by Khalid, Amr, Abdur Rahman bin Awf, and Muawiyah. In late April 637, Jerusalem was officially surrendered to the caliph. For the first time, after almost 500 years of oppressive Roman rule, Jews were once again <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> and worship inside Jerusalem.|$|E

5|$|Afterwards, {{seventeen}} {{people were}} indicted {{by a federal}} grand jury and five were found guilty of wilfully interfering with a marshal in performance of his duties (Braden, Patterson, Pryor, Purcell, and John J. Doyle, a leader in the Settler's League). They were convicted in federal court (with Judge Sawyer presiding) and sentenced to eight months in prison and fined $300 each. Their time spent in imprisonment was hardly difficult. Three of the men's wives were <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with them, and Susan Curtis, daughter of one of the jailers, fell in love with and later married Braden. Upon their release in September 1881, they were greeted by a joyous crowd of 3,000 in Hanford. Such was the anti-railroad sentiment that the five were looked upon as heroes by many across California, and those killed were considered martyrs who had given their lives for a cause.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 16 or 17, Cadron met a {{travelling}} salesman named Jean-Marie Jetté, possibly while at a family gathering, and married him on October 7, 1811 at the Church of Lavaltrie. Jean-Marie was the brother of Paul Jetté, Cadron's uncle by marriage, {{and at the time}} the two met he was in his thirties. After the wedding, Rosalie Cadron took her husband's name and was known as Rosalie Cadron-Jetté. Jean-Marie moved into Cadron-Jetté's parents' house with her, and undertook a new career as a farmer. In 1811, that house, along with the surrounding land and outbuildings, was donated to Cadron-Jetté and Jean-Marie by Cadron-Jetté's parents, on the condition that the parents be <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> there until their death, and that Cadron-Jetté and Jean-Marie assume the care of Cadron-Jetté's sister Sophie until her age of majority.|$|E
5|$|By now the Ordainers {{had drawn}} up their Ordinances for reform and Edward had little {{political}} {{choice but to}} give way and accept them in October. The Ordinances of 1311 contained clauses limiting the King's right {{to go to war}} or to grant land without parliament's approval, giving parliament control over the royal administration, abolishing the system of prises, excluding the Frescobaldi bankers, and introducing a system to monitor the adherence to the Ordinances. In addition, the Ordinances exiled Gaveston once again, this time with instructions that he should not be <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> anywhere within Edward's lands, including Gascony and Ireland, and that he should be stripped of his titles. Edward retreated to his estates at Windsor and Kings Langley; Gaveston left England, possibly for northern France or Flanders.|$|E

5|$|By the 18th century, {{the prison}} had {{separate}} areas for its {{two classes of}} prisoner: the master's side, which housed about 50rooms for rent, and the common or poor side, consisting of nine small rooms, or wards, into which 300people were confined from dusk until dawn. Room rents on the master's side were ten shillings a week in 1728, with most prisoners forced to share. John Baptist Grano paid 2s 6d (two shillings and six pennies) for a room with two beds on the master's side, shared with three other prisoners: Daniel Blunt, a tailor who owed £9, Benjamin Sandford, a lighterman from Bermondsey who owed £55, and a Mr. Blundell, a jeweller. Women prisoners who could pay the fees were housed in the women's quarters, known as the oak. The wives, daughters and lovers of male prisoners were <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with them, if someone was paying their way.|$|E
5|$|Hippopotamuses {{have been}} the {{subjects}} of various African folktales. According to a San story; when the Creator assigned each animal its place in nature, the hippos {{wanted to live in}} the water, but were refused out of fear that they might eat all the fish. After begging and pleading, the hippos were finally <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in the water on the conditions that they would eat grass instead of fish and would fling their dung {{so that it can be}} inspected for fish bones. In a Ndebele tale, the hippo originally had long, beautiful hair, but was set on fire by a jealous hare and had to jump into a nearby pool. The hippo lost most of his hair and was too embarrassed to leave the water.|$|E
5|$|In 894 Stylianos Zaoutzes, basileopator {{and leading}} {{minister}} of Leo VI the Wise (r. 886–912), convinced the emperor {{to move the}} Bulgarian market from Constantinople to Thessaloniki. That move affected not only private interests but also the international commercial importance of Bulgaria and the principle of Byzantine–Bulgarian trade, regulated with the Treaty of 716 and later agreements on the most favoured nation basis. The Bulgarian merchants were <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in Constantinople, resided in their own colony and paid favourable taxes. The city was a major destination of trade routes from all over Europe and Asia and {{the transfer of the}} Bulgarian market to Thessaloniki cut short the direct access to goods from the east, which under the new circumstances the Bulgarians would have to buy through middlemen, who were close associates of Stylianos Zaoutzes. In Thessaloniki the Bulgarians were also forced to pay higher tariffs to sell their goods, enriching Zaoutzes' cronies.|$|E

5|$|Although {{at peace}} with Parthia, Rome still {{interfered}} in its affairs. The Roman emperor Tiberius (r.14–37AD) became involved in a plot by Pharasmanes I of Iberia to place his brother Mithridates on the throne of Armenia by assassinating the Parthian ally King Arsaces of Armenia. Artabanus III {{tried and failed to}} restore Parthian control of Armenia, prompting an aristocratic revolt that forced him to flee to Scythia. The Romans released a hostage prince, Tiridates III of Parthia, to rule the region as an ally of Rome. Shortly before his death, Artabanus managed to force Tiridates from the throne using troops from Hyrcania. After Artabanus' death in 38AD, a long civil war ensued between the rightful successor Vardanes I and his brother Gotarzes II of Parthia. After Vardanes was assassinated during a hunting expedition, the Parthian nobility appealed to Roman emperor Claudius (r. 41–54AD) in 49AD to release the hostage prince Meherdates to challenge Gotarzes. This backfired when Meherdates was betrayed by the governor of Edessa and Izates bar Monobaz of Adiabene; he was captured and sent to Gotarzes, where he was <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> after having his ears mutilated, an act that disqualified him from inheriting the throne.|$|E
5|$|In the afterlife, {{in which}} Oceanic Flight 815 does not crash on the Island, Faraday has a {{different}} background. Daniel was allowed to pursue his passion for music, and never trained in physics. After overhearing Eloise trying to persuade Desmond to stop pursuing Penelope (Sonya Walger), Faraday approaches Desmond and shares his theory of the timeline being altered. He tells Desmond that he recently saw a red-haired woman he strongly felt he already knew and loved. Daniel states after the encounter, he {{made a series of}} notes in his journal which a mathematician has identified as advanced quantum mechanics, a topic he knows nothing about. Daniel shows his notes, and hypothesises that the world as he and Desmond are experiencing is not their correct path. Faraday then tells him Penelope is his half-sister and where Desmond can find her. Later, Faraday meets Charlotte at his benefit concert, but they do not yet realize they are in the afterlife. Daniel then takes the stage with DriveShaft to play as Charlotte watches from the crowd. It is later implied that both Eloise and Desmond are both aware that they are living in the afterlife. Eloise convinces Desmond to let Faraday live out the rest of his afterlife, since Faraday was never <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> the life he wanted in his past, and Eloise was never allowed to spend time with her son.|$|E

5|$|The {{new town}} of Caernarfon was {{populated}} by English settlers, particularly from nearby Cheshire and Lancashire, {{and the town}} walls were in part designed to encourage immigrants and royal officials to settle there in safety. The town of Caernarfon did not prove a successful settlement, however; by 1298 it had only 59 burgage tenementsproperties paying rent to the kingmaking it far less prosperous than either neighbouring Conwy or Beaumaris, and the situation did not improve during the 14th century. In 1400 Welsh prince Owain Glyndŵr rose in rebellion against English rule, but despite attempts to take Caernarfon in 1403 and 1404, the town's defences held out. The ascension of the Tudor dynasty to the English throne resulted in {{a change in the}} way Wales was administered. The Tudors were Welsh in origin, and their rule lessened hostilities between the Welsh and English, reducing the need to maintain Caernarfon's castle and walls and easing the restrictions on Welsh access to the townthe Welsh were finally <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> inside Caernarfon in 1507.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with the}} demon Nadja, Aleph travels through the underground, finding a brainwashed Hiroko in a {{concentration}} camp.

On their way back, Aleph and Hiroko learn that the Center has released the demon Abaddon to swallow the entire Valhalla district, and that the Center only plans to let those they deem worthy be <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in the Thousand-Year Kingdom; everyone else would be abandoned and left to die. Zayin starts a revolt against the Center, who threatens {{to cut off the}} air supply to the Holytown district if he does not surrender; he, Aleph and Hiroko go to the Center to confront the four elders leading it. Aleph and Hiroko learn that the elders are actually the archangels Michael, Raphael, Uriel and Gabriel; Aleph and Hiroko fight and kill the first three archangels, after which Gabriel reveals that YHVH, the creator god, had ordered the archangels to watch over the creation of Tokyo Millennium and wait for the Messiah, but that Michael, Raphael and Uriel, unable to wait any longer, created Aleph as an artificial, false Messiah, leading YHVH to abandon them; he was the boy Hiroko was searching for, aged unnaturally fast to take on the role of Messiah. Similarly, Beth was artificially created as the Messiah's partner, Zayin as his bodyguard, Daleth as a false savior intended to be defeated by the Messiah so that Aleph would win the people's favor, and Gimmel as a trial Messiah for the Arcadia prototype.|$|E
