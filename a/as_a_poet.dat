In his lifetime, he was best known <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>poet,</b> although by the late twentieth-century he was primarily known as a designer of wallpapers and fabrics.|$|E
5|$|Einarr {{must have}} had some fame <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>poet,</b> as his name {{is used in the}} Háttatal, an {{examination}} of Old Norse poetry written in the thirteenth-century, to refer to a specific type of metre, Torf-Einarsháttr.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} {{primary school}} {{in his native}} village, he graduated from {{a high school in}} the Danube port of Brăila, then enrolled at the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy in Bucharest. He was also attending lectures at the Faculty of Chemistry and Physics. Cerna debuted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>poet</b> in 1897, at the age of sixteen, when his Trecutul ("The Past")—an adaptation of a piece by Nikolaus Lenau—was published in George Coşbuc's Foaia Interesantă magazine. His first original poem, Orientale ("Orientals"), saw print two years later in the magazine Carmen.|$|E

In 1999 he won the City of Toronto Book Award for his sequence of poems Benedict Abroad.|$|R
50|$|The Great Soviet Encyclopaedia of 1939 {{likewise}} called Nizami <b>as</b> <b>an</b> Azerbaijani <b>poet</b> (the {{author of}} the article was Yevgeni Bertels who had previously referred to Nizami <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Persian <b>poet).</b> The article in the official Soviet Encyclopaedia completed the process of revising Nizami’s nationality in Soviet Oriental studies. After 1940 Soviet scholars and encyclopaedias acknowledged Nizami <b>as</b> <b>an</b> Azerbaijani <b>poet.</b> Any other point of view started to be considered <b>as</b> <b>a</b> serious political mistake.|$|R
50|$|Novelist Thomas Hardy (1840-1928) wrote poetry {{throughout}} his career, {{but he did}} not publish his first collection until 1898, so that he tends to be treated <b>as</b> <b>a</b> 20th-century <b>poet.</b> Now regarded <b>as</b> <b>a</b> major <b>poet,</b> Gerard Manley Hopkins's (1844-89) Poems were published posthumously by Robert Bridges in 1918.|$|R
5|$|Blackstone revelled in Charterhouse's {{academic}} curriculum, {{particularly the}} Latin poetry of Ovid and Virgil. He began to attract note <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>poet</b> at school, writing a 30-line set of rhyming couplets {{to celebrate the}} wedding of James Hotchkis, the headmaster. He also won a silver medal for his Latin verses on John Milton, gave the annual Latin oration in 1738, and was noted as having been the favourite student of his masters. On 1 October 1738, {{taking advantage of a}} new scholarship available to Charterhouse students, Blackstone matriculated at Pembroke College, Oxford.|$|E
5|$|Goldfaden wandered Europe <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>poet</b> and journalist. His plays {{continued}} to be performed in Europe and America, but rarely, if ever, did anyone send him royalties. His health deteriorated – a 1903 letter refers to asthma and spitting up blood – and he {{was running out of}} money. In 1903, he wrote Jacob Dinesohn from Paris, authorizing him to sell his remaining possessions in Romania, clothes and all. This gave him the money to head once more to New York in 1904.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, as {{recognition}} {{for his work}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>poet,</b> Tzara was awarded the prestigious Taormina Prize. One of his final public activities took place in 1962, when he attended the International Congress on African Culture, organized by English curator Frank McEwen and held at the National Gallery in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia. He died one year later in his Paris home, and was buried at the Cimetière du Montparnasse.|$|E

5|$|Morris is {{recognised}} {{as one of}} {{the most}} significant cultural figures of Victorian Britain; though best known in his lifetime <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>poet,</b> he posthumously became better known for his designs. Founded in 1955, the William Morris Society is devoted to his legacy, while multiple biographies and studies of his work have seen publication. Many of the buildings associated with his life are open to visitors, much of his work can be found in art galleries and museums, and his designs are still in production.|$|E
5|$|Riley {{became a}} bestselling author in the 1890s. His children's poems were {{compiled}} {{into a book}} and illustrated by Howard Chandler Christy. Titled the Rhymes of Childhood, the book was his most popular and sold millions of copies. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>poet,</b> Riley achieved an uncommon level of fame during his own lifetime. He was honored with annual Riley Day celebrations around the United States and was regularly called on to perform readings at national civic events. He continued to write and hold occasional poetry readings until a stroke paralyzed his right arm in 1910.|$|E

5|$|The son of {{a wealthy}} {{landowner}} and cleric, Heber gained an early reputation at the University of Oxford <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>poet.</b> After graduation, he expanded {{his view of the}} world by undertaking, {{at the height of the}} Napoleonic Wars, an extended tour of Scandinavia, Russia and central Europe. He was ordained in 1807, and took over his father's old parish of Hodnet in Shropshire. He combined his pastoral duties with other church offices, hymn-writing, and more general literary work which included a critical study of the complete works of the 17th-century cleric Jeremy Taylor.|$|E
5|$|Barbauld's career <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>poet</b> ended {{abruptly}} in 1812 {{with the}} publication of Eighteen Hundred and Eleven, which criticised Britain's participation in the Napoleonic Wars. She was shocked by the vicious reviews it received and published nothing else in her lifetime. Her reputation was further damaged when many of the Romantic poets she had inspired in the heyday of the French Revolution turned against her in their later, more conservative years. Barbauld was remembered only as a pedantic children's writer in the nineteenth century, and largely forgotten in the twentieth, but the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1980s renewed interest in her works and restored her place in literary history.|$|E
5|$|He {{started his}} career <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>poet</b> at an early age, at about 11 or 12 years old. He was educated at first in Maʿarra and Aleppo, later also in Antioch and other Syrian cities. Among his {{teachers}} in Aleppo were companions from the circle of Ibn Khalawayh. This grammarian and Islamic scholar had died in 980 CE when al-Maʿarri was still a child. Al-Maʿarri nevertheless laments the loss of Ibn Khalawayh in strong terms in a poem of his Risālat al-ghufrān. Al-Qifti reports that when {{on his way to}} Tripoli, Al-Maʿarri visited a Christian monastery near Latakia where he listened to debates about Hellenistic philosophy, which planted in him the seeds of his later scepticism and irreligiosity; but other historians such as Ibn al-Adim deny that he had been exposed to any theology other than Islamic doctrine.|$|E

5|$|In Nischindipur, rural Bengal, in the 1910s, Harihar Roy (Kanu Banerjee) earns a meagre {{living as}} a pujari (priest), but dreams of a better career <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>poet</b> and playwright. His wife Sarbajaya (Karuna Banerjee) takes care of their children, Durga (Uma Dasgupta) and Apu (Subir Banerjee), and Harihar's elderly cousin, Indir Thakrun (Chunibala Devi). Because of their limited resources, Sarbajaya resents having to share her home with the old and {{helpless}} cripple Indir. At times, Sarbajaya's taunts become offensive, forcing Indir to take temporary refuge {{in the home of}} another relative. Durga is fond of Indir and often gives her fruit she has stolen from a wealthy neighbour's orchard. One day, the neighbour's wife accuses Durga of stealing a bead necklace (which Durga denies) and blames Sarbajaya for encouraging her tendency to steal.|$|E
5|$|The war had {{shattered}} Pound's {{belief in}} modern western civilization. He saw the Vorticist movement as finished and doubted his own future <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>poet.</b> He {{had only the}} New Age to write for; his relationship with Poetry was finished, The Egoist was quickly {{running out of money}} because of censorship problems caused by the serialization of Joyce's Ulysses, and the funds for The Little Review had dried up. Other magazines ignored his submissions or refused to review his work. Toward the end of 1920 he and Dorothy decided their time in London was over and resolved to move to Paris.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his life, but {{especially}} during the 1770s, Bellman also wrote religious poetry, seeing no conflict with his bacchanalian works; he published collections of his religious poems in 1781 and 1787. He wrote some ten plays (none with particularly strong plots) as divertimentos, some of them later serving as entertainments at the royal court. The plays fill Volume 6 of his collected works. In 1783, Bellman brought out The Temple of Bacchus (Bacchi Tempel), perhaps hoping to establish his reputation <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>poet,</b> rather than the merry entertainer {{that he was in}} fact known as at the time; but he always stood out in people's minds as unique, a different kind of writer and performer.|$|E

5|$|Dickinson's herbarium, {{which is}} now held in the Houghton Library at Harvard University, was {{published}} in 2006 as Emily Dickinson's Herbarium by Harvard University Press. The original work was compiled by Dickinson during her years at Amherst Academy, and consists of 424 pressed specimens of plants arranged on 66 pages of a bound album. A digital facsimile of the herbarium is available online. The town of Amherst Jones Library's Special Collections department has an Emily Dickinson Collection consisting of approximately seven thousand items, including original manuscript poems and letters, family correspondence, scholarly articles and books, newspaper clippings, theses, plays, photographs and contemporary artwork and prints. The Archives and Special Collections at Amherst College has substantial holdings of Dickinson's manuscripts and letters {{as well as a}} lock of Dickinson's hair and the original of the only positively identified image of the poet. In 1965, in recognition of Dickinson's growing stature <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>poet,</b> the Homestead was purchased by Amherst College. It opened to the public for tours, and also served as a faculty residence for many years. The Emily Dickinson Museum was created in 2003 when ownership of the Evergreens, which had been occupied by Dickinson family heirs until 1988, was transferred to the college.|$|E
5|$|Bards, {{who acted}} as musicians, {{but also as}} poets, story tellers, historians, genealogists and lawyers, relying on an oral {{tradition}} that stretched back generations, were found in Scotland as well as Wales and Ireland. Often accompanying themselves on the harp, {{they can also be}} seen in records of the Scottish courts throughout the medieval period. Scottish church music from the later Middle Ages was increasingly influenced by continental developments, with figures like 13th-century musical theorist Simon Tailler studying in Paris before returning to Scotland, where he introduced several reforms in church music. Scottish collections of music like the 13th-century 'Wolfenbüttel 677', which is associated with St Andrews, contain mostly French compositions, but with some distinctive local styles. The captivity of James I in England from 1406 to 1423, where he earned a reputation <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>poet</b> and composer, may have led him to take English and continental styles and musicians back to the Scottish court on his release. In the late 15th century a series of Scottish musicians trained in the Netherlands before returning home, including John Broune, Thomas Inglis and John Fety, the last of whom became master of the song school in Aberdeen and then Edinburgh, introducing the new five-fingered organ playing technique. In 1501 James IV refounded the Chapel Royal within Stirling Castle, with a new and enlarged choir, and it became the focus of Scottish liturgical music. Burgundian and English influences were probably reinforced when Henry VII's daughter Margaret Tudor married James IV in 1503.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1890s, Morris was {{increasingly}} ill and living largely as an invalid; {{aside from his}} gout, he also exhibited signs of epilepsy. In August 1891, he took his daughter Jenny {{on a tour of}} Northern France to visit the Medieval churches and cathedrals. Back in England, he spent an increasing amount of time at Kelmscott Manor. Seeking treatment from the prominent doctor William Broadbent, he was prescribed a holiday in the coastal town of Folkestone. In December 1894 he was devastated upon learning of his mother's death; she had been 90 years old. In July 1896, he went on a cruise to Norway with construction engineer John Carruthers, during which he visited Vadsö and Trondheim; during the trip his physical condition deteriorated and he began experiencing hallucinations. Returning to Kelmscott House, he became a complete invalid, being visited by friends and family, before dying of tuberculosis on the morning of 4 October 1896. Obituaries appearing throughout the national press reflected that at the time, Morris was widely recognised primarily <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>poet.</b> Mainstream press obituaries trivialised or dismissed his involvement in socialism, although the socialist press focused largely on this aspect of his career. His funeral was held on 6 October, during which his corpse was carried from Hammersmith to Paddington rail station, where it was transported to Oxford, and from there to Kelmscott, where it was buried in the churchyard of St. George's Church.|$|E
