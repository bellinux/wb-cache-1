Because Lowell astronomers thought Pluto was massive enough to perturb planets, they assumed that its albedo could be no less than 0.07 (meaning that it reflected only 7% of the light that hit it); about <b>as</b> <b>dark</b> <b>as</b> asphalt and {{similar to that of}} Mercury, the least reflective planet known. This would give Pluto an estimated mass of no more than 70% that of Earth. Observations also revealed that Pluto's orbit was very elliptical, far more than that of any other planet.|$|E

25|$|Into the afternoon, {{the skies}} started to darken, but the Weather Bureau Observatory was not overly concerned. Many residents, however, fled to their homes, anticipating severe weather. At 4:30, the {{temperature}} fell rapidly {{and black and}} greenish clouds approached the city. Near 5:00 pm, it was <b>as</b> <b>dark</b> <b>as</b> it would otherwise be 3 hours later in the day. As the thunderstorm approached St. Louis, the western portion {{of the city was}} particularly affected. The winds were initially around 37 miles per hour, but they quickly increased to almost 80 miles per hour.|$|E
25|$|This last {{printing}} {{may have}} consisted of several printing runs or perhaps was contracted out to different printers. While no deliberate {{changes to the}} text block have been noted, the binding cloth and the text block's paper stock both changed at times, and flaws developed in the printing plates over time. One of the cloth variants {{is similar to the}} first printing's, but even yellower. Another shows an even weave with light, very even oatmeal coloring that can even seem faintly pink in some light. Its cloth shows deep, vivid blues in the lettering, whereas the others look obviously paler. Yet another variant carries a variegated linen-like weave wherein individual threads can stand out for several centimeters. This latter is <b>as</b> <b>dark</b> <b>as</b> the binding of the third printing (while lacking the yellow cast), but the coloring is so uneven that it might be mistaken as soiled even when clean. Soiling on the other variants, on the other hand, is immediately apparent.|$|E

Although Morgan was initially afraid to add humor to his script, he created a compromise by making the episode <b>as</b> <b>dark</b> <b>as</b> possible. Several of the characters' names are references to silent film-era actors and screenwriters. Notably, the episode features a prediction by Bruckman—that Agent Scully will not die—that is later bookended by the sixth season episode [...] "Tithonus." ...|$|E

Cornell even admitted [...] "Dusty" [...] was [...] "pretty positive for a Soundgarden song", describing it as an opposite to the previous album's [...] "Fell On Black Days". According to Cornell, [...] "Pretty Noose" [...] is about [...] "an attractively packaged bad idea," [...] and [...] "Ty Cobb" [...] is about a [...] "hardcore pissed-off idiot." [...] Cornell said that the songs [...] "Never Named" [...] and [...] "Boot Camp" [...] are based on his childhood. Thayil said that the lyrics for [...] "Never the Machine Forever" [...] are about [...] "a life-and-death match between an individual and a less specifically defined entity". Cornell referred to [...] "Overfloater" [...] as [...] "self-affirming".|$|E
500|$|The {{scenes in}} which Mulder infiltrates the air base were {{shot at a}} real United States airbase. With a small budget and a {{television}} schedule to think of, Carter said the effects seemed [...] "good, given the restrictions" [...] they faced. The UFO was digitally constructed, based around what visual effects supervisor Mat Beck described as a [...] "sort of disco light rig" [...] that was rented from a [...] "party supplier". Carter commented on Sackheim's direction, noting that the episode was [...] "shot well". Towards the end of filming the night-time scenes, the sun was beginning to rise, forcing crew member John Bartley to rig the angles to keep the scenes <b>as</b> <b>dark</b> <b>as</b> possible. One scene, in which Mulder infiltrates the Air Force base, had already been rewritten to change its daytime setting to night; the rising sun forced the scene to be filmed as originally conceived.|$|E

500|$|For Satisfied, DecembeRadio made {{a concerted}} effort to write lyrics that were more {{uplifting}} than those featured on their previous album. [...] Said Bunn, [...] "Our first record had a lot of darker songs such as 'Razor' and 'Greed'. [...] Even though we liked some of that, we truly realized we're a bunch of happy guys! [...] We like to have fun onstage and in our lives, so we didn't want this album to be <b>as</b> <b>dark</b> <b>as</b> the last one." [...] To that end, the band wrote and included on Satisfied songs like [...] "Better Man", which Reedy says imparts that [...] "if we learn from our mistakes and follow Jesus Christ it will make us a better man", and the [...] "vertical worship song" [...] "For Your Glory". [...] The band was inspired to write [...] "Find You Waiting" [...] following the death of a friend of producer Scotty Wilbanks. [...] At the funeral, the man's widow stood over the casket praising God with arms raised amidst her sorrow. [...] "It struck a chord in our hearts to write a song about how, no matter what current problem we might be facing, God's love and mercy is always waiting there for us", said Reedy.|$|E
500|$|Empire's Kim Newman {{gave the}} film 4 out of 5 stars, and felt people [...] "will like the {{characters}} {{more than the}} film," [...] before adding that there are enough strong moments to guarantee a good viewing. The Guardians Peter Bradshaw stated that the film held [...] "unconvincing touches" [...] but was more enjoyable than Spider-Man and <b>as</b> <b>dark</b> <b>as</b> Tim Burton's Batman. BBC film critic Nev Pierce believed the film had spectacular set-pieces, but felt there was no strong narrative arc to keep the viewer interested. The Wall Street Journals Joe Morgenstern considered the film to be neither original nor great but felt it maintained [...] "many grace notes and interesting oddities." [...] The Globe and Mail's Rick Groen said the film was [...] "not woeful, not wonderful, merely watchable." [...] The Philadelphia Inquirers Steven Rea thought the film brought a variance of humor and violence, but felt it didn't {{work as well as}} it could have. James Berardinelli felt it was merely a satisfactory superhero film. TV Guides Frank Lovece said Daredevil [...] "makes clear that superhero films are the next evolutionary generation of action movies: Now that Schwarzenegger-styled heroes have upped the action ante as far as the human body can go and remain even marginally believable, it's up to superheroes ...to take it further." [...] He also felt it was [...] "a movie for grown-ups, not kids." ...|$|E
500|$|The Queen rejoices in her victory, but is soon {{discovered}} by the angry Seven Dwarfs, who grab pickaxes and chase her deep into the forest as a great storm begins. She climbs up into the mountains, where she gets trapped upon a precipice that overlooks a seemingly bottomless canyon. She tries to push down a large boulder to crush the approaching Dwarfs. Before she can do so, a lightning bolt strikes {{between her and the}} boulder, destroying the precipice and sending the Queen (along with the boulder) down the cliff to her death, screaming while she falls to the jagged rocks below (this scream was reused in Sleeping Beauty when Maleficent is stabbed in the heart by the Sword of Truth). As the Dwarfs look wide-eyed over the cliff's edge, they cannot see her, but the vultures descend into the chasm. The Queen's dark reign is over, and her castle is then taken over and the revived Snow White and the Prince who broke the spell. (A 1936 pre-release Good Housekeeping novelization by Dorothy Ann Blank, a member of the film's story team, affirms that the Queen in fact dies: [...] "Far below, in a chasm <b>as</b> <b>dark</b> <b>as</b> her own wicked soul, lay the body of the hateful Queen. No magic would ever bring her to life again.") ...|$|E

500|$|As the wet {{season ended}} in early 1852, Seacole joined other traders in Cruces in packing up {{to move to}} Gorgona. She records a white American giving a speech at a leaving dinner in which he wished that [...] "God bless the best yaller woman he ever made" [...] and asked the {{listeners}} to join with him in rejoicing that [...] "she's so many shades removed from being entirely black". He {{went on to say}} that [...] "if we could bleach her by any means we would and thus make her acceptable in any company as she deserves to be". Seacole replied firmly that she did not [...] "appreciate your friend's kind wishes with respect to my complexion. If it had been <b>as</b> <b>dark</b> <b>as</b> any nigger's, I should have been just as happy and just as useful, and as much respected by those whose respect I value." [...] She declined the offer of [...] "bleaching" [...] and drank [...] "to you and the general reformation of American manners". Salih notes the use of American pidgin, against Seacole's clear English, as representational of a supposed white moral and intellectual superiority. Seacole also comments on the positions of responsibility taken on by escaped American slaves in Panama, as well as in the priesthood, the army, and public offices, commenting that [...] "it is wonderful to see how freedom and equality elevate men". She also records an antipathy between Panamanians and Americans, which she attributes in part to the fact that so many of the former had once been slaves of the latter.|$|E
500|$|Sand {{and dust}} storms are natural events {{that occur in}} arid regions where the land is not {{protected}} by a covering of vegetation. Dust storms usually start in desert margins rather than the deserts themselves where the finer materials have already been blown away. As a steady wind begins to blow, fine particles lying on the exposed ground begin to vibrate. At greater wind speeds, some particles are lifted into the air stream. When they land, they strike other particles which may be jerked into the air in their turn, starting a chain reaction. Once ejected, these particles move {{in one of three}} possible ways, depending on their size, shape and density; suspension, saltation or creep. Suspension is only possible for particles less than 0.1mm (0.004in) in diameter. In a dust storm, these fine particles are lifted up and wafted aloft to heights of up to [...] They reduce visibility and can remain in the atmosphere for days on end, conveyed by the trade winds for distances of up to [...] Denser clouds of dust can be formed in stronger winds, moving across the land with a billowing leading edge.

In a study of a dust storm in China in 2001, it was estimated that 6.5 million tons of dust were involved, covering an area of [...] The mean particle size was 1.44 μm. A much smaller scale, short-lived phenomenon can occur in calm conditions when hot air near the ground rises quickly through a small pocket of cooler, low-pressure air above forming a whirling column of particles, a dust devil.|$|E

The Bunny Lakes are Coming is a melange of pop cultural melancholy and terror that is as sensitive as a fresh bruise.

Male-pattern baldness is widespread, but not as common as among Europeans. Most have smooth skin, but some grow hair on their arms, legs, and chest, and have beards.

Relatively robust physiques are more common among coastal populations, while people from higher altitudes tend to be leaner.|$|E
