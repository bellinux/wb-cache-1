40|$|The {{information}} technology sector is {{hailed as a}} lucrative industry where highly skilled workers may carve a rewarding and successful career. It is also {{an industry that has}} mainly developed in the United States and has subsequently spread {{to the rest of the}} world, bringing with it certain 'Americanised' values and work practices, such as nontrade union membership. This thesis explores the professional and personal development and trade union membership of IT workers in the Republic of Ireland and the United States. The main findings of both studies indicate that poor levels of training at work occur among Silicon Valley respondents, and that Silicon Valley workers tend to have an excessively long working week, and place most emphasis on material needs and least on family and leisure. The low levels of membership of trade unions and professional societies in both locations highlights <b>a</b> <b>postmodern</b> <b>trend</b> towards individualism, although this trend is more pronounced in Silicon Valley...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} two sections: {{a critical}} research essay focusing on Michael Chabon’s 2002 novel The Yiddish Policemen’s Union {{and the first}} ten chapters of a detective novel entitled Te Ngaio Road. In both sections, I explore the critical evaluation of literary and genre fiction and the influence different genres have on literary authors. The critical portion of the thesis investigate the historical, cultural and ideological underpinnings of the perception of knowledge, contemporary perceptions of literary and genre fiction, including {{the formation of the}} canon and the postmodern concept of innovative literary fiction. Using Chabon’s novel The Yiddish Policemen’s Union as a focus, I argue that the dismantling of boundaries between literary and genre indicate <b>a</b> post <b>postmodern</b> <b>trend</b> and <b>a</b> new literary form rather than a continuation of postmodernism. In Te Ngaio Road a detective genre framework is used along with a modernist stream of consciousness and multiple points of view. There is also <b>a</b> <b>postmodern</b> focus on the aesthetic form and innovation, and an overlap of literary and genre influences to trace the investigation of the murder of a small girl in a conflicted community...|$|R

40|$|At first glance, {{the postmodern}} spiritual ‘scene’ appears ‘sociologically messy, experiential, multifaceted, ecological, {{provisional}} and collective’ (Petrolle 2007) and of uncertain epistemic provenance. Here, I ask: can Roland Benedikter’s (2005) conception of postmodern dialectic and spiritual turn, {{help us understand}} postmodern spirituality and can it assist in a construction of <b>a</b> <b>postmodern</b> epistemology of spirituality? The current argument constitutes a meta-theoretical exploration of: • Deconstruction and neo-essentialism as representing the significant dialectic in philosophical postmodernism. Deconstruction is presented as an apophatic moment in Western thought about ‘knowing’ and ‘being’ whilst postmodern neo-essentialism, though contextualised by antirealism and ambiguity, palpably suggests itself. • <b>Postmodern</b> <b>trends</b> which derive from the dialectic. • How these epistemic trends influence methodology {{in the study of}} spirituality. • How a trans-traditional (anthropological) spirituality might incorporate insights about transformation from a complex of epistemologies in which, theories of ‘self’ abound. In the conclusion an attempt is made to describe how postmodern spirituality expresses itself in society.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Gloucester, Massachusetts {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as the quintessential working port in the Northeast {{and the home of}} commercial fishing in America for several hundred years. Today, Gloucester's working port is threatened by dwindling fish stocks, strict land-use regulations and development pressures. The expansion of the tourism sector is spurned because 1) it is not fishing 2) it is not to be trusted, that it could turn against Gloucester and degrade the unique, authentic character of the city. I argue that managing Gloucester's waterfront as an attractive, appealing destination and protecting the working port are not antithetical concepts. In fact, combining both of these notions might {{be the best way to}} protect Gloucester's identity and preserve its living heritage. Planning should endeaver to mitigate any potential conflict between the two, and wherever possible, bind their fates together to create a sustainable, authentic place. This thesis is divided into analysis and recommendations. The analysis covers Gloucester's present situation through an exploration of the city's history and culture, and is paired with a review of the global waterfront revival movement and discussion of <b>a</b> number of <b>postmodern</b> <b>trends</b> as they relate to Gloucester. The combined findings of this local and cultural analysis form the basis for the urban design recommendations in the second part of the thesis. The recommendations are divided into three categories: policy issues, physical improvements and institutional reforms. by Laurie Reyna Pessah. Thesis (M. C. P.)

40|$|This {{thesis is}} the first {{systematic}} study on the Teatro por la Identidad (TxI), a theater movement that emerged in Argentina in 2000. TxI productions deal with memory and identity as their main subjects and, aesthetically, follow <b>postmodern</b> <b>trends.</b> This thesis analyzes, first, the origin and evolution of the TxI movement up until 2005, {{with an emphasis on}} its geographical extension to other areas in the country and abroad, as well as its impact on theater itself and other areas during the first six years of performances. Second, TxI is defined a social theater and analyzed {{in the context of the}} evolution of the Argentine theater itself, in particular in relation to the Teatro Independiente and Teatro Abierto movements. Third, the discussion goes further into TxI as social theater and how it deals with sociopolitical needs represented by the search by the Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo of those grandchildren abducted during the 1976 - 1983 military dictatorship. Common points are also established between TxI productions and recent theories on memory, such as those suggested by Tzevetan Todorov, Paul Ricoeur and Maurice Halbwachs. Fourth, TxI productions are assessed from the point of view of <b>postmodern</b> <b>trends</b> that have been present in the Argentin...|$|R
