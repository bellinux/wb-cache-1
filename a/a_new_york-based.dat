5|$|A Free Ride, {{also known}} as A Grass Sandwich, is a stag film of the silent era that is {{considered}} to be the earliest extant American hardcore pornographic movie. It depicts a motorist who picks up two women from the roadside and later engages in several sex acts with them. Although most scholars consider A Free Ride a 1915 film, some sources claim that it was produced later. The film's director used a pseudonym and the cast remained anonymous. The filming location is not known, although it may have been produced in New Jersey. Two contradictory theories have emerged regarding the identities of the cast: some sources suggest they were people with low social status, but others assert the opposite. The Kinsey Institute has a print of the film in its collection. A Free Ride was screened at the inauguration of the Museum of Sex. In 2004, Lisa Oppenheim, <b>a</b> <b>New</b> <b>York-based</b> artist, remade the film.|$|E

5|$|The Sounds {{had planned}} to leave Greer Stadium in the mid 2000s for a new {{ballpark}} to be called First Tennessee Field, but the project was abandoned after the city, developers, and team could not come to terms {{on a plan to}} finance its construction. On October 30, 2008, following this failure to secure a new ballpark, Amerisports Companies LLC entered into an agreement to sell the Sounds to MFP Baseball, <b>a</b> <b>New</b> <b>York-based</b> group of investors consisting of Masahiro Honzawa, Steve Posner, and Frank Ward. Keeping the team in Nashville was one of the PCL's top criteria for approval of the sale. The transaction received final approval from Major League Baseball and the PCL on February 26, 2009. MFP made significant renovations to Greer Stadium while it continued to explore options for building a new downtown ballpark for the club.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Gretzky {{sold the}} card to Wal-Mart and Treat Entertainment for $500,000. The two {{companies}} {{intended to use}} the card as the grand prize in a promotional contest. The card was sent all across the United States, as part of Wal-Mart's plan to rejuvenate the baseball card market. On February 24 of the following year, the 122nd anniversary of Wagner's birthday, the grand prize drawing for the card was held on CNN's Larry King Weekend. At around 9:00 P.M., Hall of Fame third baseman Brooks Robinson, one of King's guests on the show, pulled out {{the name of one}} Patricia Gibbs, a postal worker living in Hollywood, Florida. After spending hours unsuccessfully trying to contact Gibbs, King's staff finally got through to her phone, and informed Gibbs of her prize. Treat Entertainment and Wal-Mart gave the card to Gibbs a few weeks later at a Wal-Mart store in Miramar, Florida. Gibbs could not afford the taxes on the card, so she decided to consign the card to an auction later on. She consigned the card to Christie's, <b>a</b> <b>New</b> <b>York-based</b> auction house better known for selling famous artworks.|$|E
