I would like to think he (would still be with Chicago), but he was very independent <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> he would have thought about the 1980s. I'd have to say it's 50/50.

60|$|The last I saw of {{the front}} was Alan Breck {{speeding}} back to his gun-positions among the mountains; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> delight of what household the lad {{must have been in}} the old days.|$|R
6000|$|... "How very remarkable," [...] said Bastin, {{contemplating the}} ruin. [...] "If I were superstitious, which I am not, I {{should say that}} this {{occurrence}} was an omen indicating the final fall of a false god.

6000|$|... "Oh! that {{explains}} it, Komba. But what an odd {{place for him}} to fish in; so far from home; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> he was fishing for. When you have time, Komba, you must explain to {{me what it is}} that you catch amidst the roots of thick reeds in such shallow water." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We're taking Jimmy's road. He was {{the last}} man to come down here, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> he was {{thinking}} about," [...] he said. [...] "There {{would have been an}} ice fringe along the bank, and Jimmy was hungry. I think he knew he wouldn't get through, and it was only because of the woman he held on so tight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] she answered. [...] "It just {{occurred}} to me. He and Louise {{have known each}} other for such a long time, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> he might have to say about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but he paid {{you pretty}} well for your {{share of the}} work," [...] I returned. I was getting mixed. The {{deception}} could not be kept up much longer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> would happen when the truth became known.|$|R
60|$|BURGE-LUBIN. Synthesis! This is an {{intellectual}} difficulty. This {{is a job}} for Confucius. I heard him use that very word the other day; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> the devil he meant. [Switching on] Hallo! Put me through to the Chief Secretary.|$|R
60|$|Sometimes Johnny <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> {{would really}} have {{happened}} if we had never started for Cousin Pamelia's wedding. I think that Ted would have come back some time; but Johnny says he doesn't believe he ever would, and Johnny ought to know, because Johnny's a boy. Anyhow, he couldn't have come back for four years. However, we did start for the wedding and so things came out all right, and Ted said we were a pair of twin special Providences.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a great {{privilege}} {{to me to}} paint you: what title {{in the world have}} I to pretend to such a model?" [...] Nick replied to Miriam. [...] "The sacrifice is yours--a sacrifice of time and good nature and credulity. You come, in your bright beauty and your genius, to this shabby place where I've nothing worth speaking of to show, not a guarantee to offer you; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> I've done to deserve such a gift of the gods." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, certainly," [...] I replied. [...] "But {{of course}} I don't {{care so much}} about him as I do about that little brown girl from the farm, and the nice Miss Langton from the White House. But it's really very {{pleasant}} to listen to you whatever you talk about. I really think you one of the most charming little girls I have ever met, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> you will be like in another five years.

6000|$|... "It's well you've come ter see me now," [...] she moaned, [...] "for you'll none 'a'e {{a chance}} {{next time you}} come'n;—No—I'm all gone but my cap——" [...] She shook that geraniumed erection, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> sardonic fate left it behind.|$|R
60|$|His {{face was}} guilty, however, {{as if his}} hand had been caught in a money-bag, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> had enticed the lad to my books. I was still {{standing}} pondering when Leeby ran up the stair; she was so active that she generally ran, and she grudged the time lost in recovering her breath.|$|R
60|$|I {{found three}} {{women in the}} little house. They were in a side kitchen eating their dinner, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> the bear would have done if he had smelled that dinner. They told me that I {{was not on the}} main road, and would have to go back more than half a mile in order to regain it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I'm eighty-seven," [...] {{said the}} old man, {{rambling}} on, childishly and weakly, [...] "and I don't know as I ever was much put out by anything. I'm not going to begin now, {{because of what he}} calls my son. He's not my son. I've had a power of pleasant times. I recollect once--no I don't--no, it's broken off. It was something about a game of cricket and a friend of mine, but it's somehow broken off. I wonder who he was--I suppose I liked him? <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> became of him--I suppose he died? But I don't know. And I don't care, neither; I don't care a bit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, ay, sir; light up, it is. I {{feel quite}} {{a concern for}} the ladies, sir, and more {{especially}} for the stores we abandon to the underwriters. A better-found ship never came out of St. Catherine's Docks or the East River, particularly in the pantry department; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> these wretches will do with her. They will be quite abashed with her conveniences, sir, and unable to enjoy them. Poor Toast, too! he will have a monstrous unpleasant time with the muscle-men; for he never eats fish; and has quite a genteel and ameliorated way with him. I shouldn't wonder if he forgot all I have taken so much pains to teach him, sir, unless he's dead; in which case it will be of no use to him in another world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This driver {{may be a}} philanthropist in disguise," [...] he answered, with dreamy irony, [...] "and {{may want}} us {{to think about the}} people who are not merely carried through this street in a coupe, but have to spend their whole lives in it, winter and summer, with no hopes of driving out of it, except in a hearse. I must say they don't seem to mind it. I haven't seen a jollier crowd {{anywhere}} in New York. They seem to have forgotten death a little more completely than any of their fellow-citizens, Isabel. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> they think of us, making this gorgeous progress through their midst. I suppose they think we're rich, and hate us--if they hate rich people; they don't look as if they hated anybody. Should we be as patient as they are with their discomfort? I don't believe there's steam heat or an elevator in the whole block. Seven rooms and a bath would be more than the largest and genteelest family would {{know what to do with}}. They wouldn't know what to do with the bath, anyway." ...|$|E
6000|$|I retired {{early that}} night, and, being young, forgot my perplexities in heavy slumber. The next morning I noticed that Alice's eyes seemed heavy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> {{could be the}} reason. In after years I {{mentioned}} it when Grace <b>and</b> <b>I</b> were talking about old times together, but she only smiled gravely, and said, [...] "I sometimes think your cousin was too good for this world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'They {{have been}} {{telling me that you}} thrashed a man awful {{yesterday}} evening,' Jacob began, as he came up. 'I heard some chaps talking about a fight as I was unloading the goods {{at the back of the}} saloon, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> was up, but I never thought as you were in it; you did not say anything about it when we were talking.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{remembered the}} fate of the man who trod the Floor of Pélé <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> would happen to our friends from the Hornet. However, in the end, as the naval men refused to be moved by either threats or entreaties, Kalaua retired at last in silent wrath, muttering to himself some unintelligible words about the folly of white men and the might of the volcano.|$|R
6000|$|And so, {{you made}} merry with my scorn of my 'Prometheus.' Believe me--believe me absolutely--I did not strike that others might spare, but from an earnest remorse. When {{you know me}} better, you will know, I hope, that I am true, whether right or wrong, and you know already that I am right in this thing, the only merit of the {{translation}} being its closeness. Can I be of any use to you, dear Mr. Mathews? When I can, make use of me. You surprise and disappoint me in your sketch of the Boston poet, for the letter he wrote to me struck me as frank and honest. I wonder if he made any use of the verses I sent him; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> I sent him--for I never made a note of it, through negligence, and have quite forgotten. Are you acquainted with Mrs. Sigourney? She has offended us much by her exposition of Mrs. Southey's letter, and I must say not without cause. I rejoice in the progress of 'Wakondah,' wishing the influences of mountain and river to be great over him and in him. And so I will say the 'God bless you' your kindness cares to hear, and remain, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Death is so frightening, I {{never think}} of it when I can help it. [...] But when {{something}} like this happens, or when I am feeling ill or [...] depressed, then I can't help remembering it is there so close, and [...] I think about all the wicked things I have done and about you and [...] me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> will happen, and I am so frightened.

60|$|Again I see {{the lantern}} {{come forward to}} the engine. But this time it comes conspicuously. A bit too conspicuously to suit me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> is up. At any rate I have {{something}} else {{to be afraid of}} than the shack on the engine. The train pulls by. Just in time, before I make my spring, I see the dark form of a shack, without a lantern, on the first blind. I let it go by, and prepare to board the second blind. But the shack on the first blind has jumped off and is at my heels. Also, I have a fleeting glimpse of the lantern of the shack who rode out the engine. He has jumped off, and now both shacks are on the ground on the same side with me. The next moment the second blind comes by and I am aboard it. But I do not linger. I have figured out my countermove. As I dash across the platform I hear the impact of the shack's feet against the steps as he boards. I jump off the other side and run forward with the train. My plan is to run forward and get on the first blind. It is nip and tuck, for the train is gathering speed. Also, the shack is behind me and running after me. I guess I am the better sprinter, for I make the first blind. I stand on the steps and watch my pursuer. He is only about ten feet back and running hard; but now the train has approximated his own speed, and, relative to me, he is standing still. I encourage him, hold out my hand to him; but he explodes in a mighty oath, gives up and makes the train several cars back.|$|E
60|$|He paused, <b>and</b> while <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> revelations he {{was about}} to make, I could not repress my impatience at the preamble.|$|R
5000|$|Regarding {{how he came}} to meet Roth, in Guitarist Magazine, Lowery relates that, [...] "when I was little, {{my dream}} was to play with David Lee Roth. One day I was sitting at my friend's house <b>and...</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what...</b> Roth is doing now. 1997, Roth had just been let go from Van Halen for a second time in favor of Gary Cherone,. I'm gonna call up his manager and see if he needs any songs." ...|$|R
60|$|Down, down, down, we went, {{till the}} yellow rim above seemed a thin band of gold. I saw {{that we were}} almost to the canyon proper, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> would happen when we reached it. The dark shaded {{watercourse}} suddenly shot out into bright light and ended in a deep cove, with perpendicular walls fifty feet high. I could see where a few rods farther on this cove opened into a huge, airy, colored canyon.|$|R
6000|$|He poured more brandy {{into the}} glass and began to think. To Barbara his mind was as an open book and she read what was passing there. What she saw were such {{thoughts}} as these: [...] "My only comfort, and yet till within two years ago, whatever else I did, I never touched drink. I swore to my mother that I never would, and had she been alive to-day----. But Bess always liked her glass, and drinking alone is no company. Ah! if my mother had lived everything would have been different, for I outgrew the bad fit and might have become quite a decent fellow. But then I met Bess again by chance, {{and she had the}} old hold on me, and there was none to keep me back, and she knew how to play her fish until I married her. The old aunt never found it out. If she had I shouldn't have 8,000 pounds a year to-day. I lied to her about that, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> she thinks of me now, if she can think where she is gone. I wonder what my mother thinks also, and my father, who was a good man by all accounts, though nobody seems to remember much about him. Supposing that they could see me now, supposing that they could have been at that supper party and witnessed the conjugal interview between me and the female creature who is my legal wife, what would they think? Well, they are dead and can't, for the dead don't come back. The dead are just a few double handfuls of dirt, no more, and since no doubt I shall join them before very long, I thank God for it, or rather I would if there were a God to thank. Here's to the company of the Dead who will never hear or see or feel anything more from everlasting to everlasting. Amen." ...|$|E
60|$|Even {{at such a}} {{place as}} the Zoological Gardens, which {{they must have been}} visiting all their lives, there were, at least, a {{thousand}} Englishmen for every cultivated American we could make sure of when we went there; and as it was a Sunday, when the gardens are closed to the general public, this overwhelming majority of natives must have come on orders from Fellows of the Society such as we had supposed would admit us much more selectly, if not solely. Still, the place was not crowded, and if it had been, still it would have been delightful on a summer afternoon, of that hovering softness, half-cloud, half-sun, which the London sky has the patent of. The hawthorn-trees, white and pink with their may, were like cloudlets dropped from that sky, as it then was and would be at sunset; and there was a density of grass underfoot and foliage overhead in which one's own childhood found itself again, so that one felt as free for the simple pleasure of consorting with strange beasts and birds as if one were still ten or eleven years old. But I cannot hope to rejuvenate my readers in the same degree, and so had better not insist upon the animals; the herds of elephants, the troops of lions and tigers, the schools of hippopotamuses, and the mass-meetings of anthropoid apes. Above and beyond these in their strangeness were the figures of humanity representative of the globe-girdling British empire, in their drawers and turbans and their swarthy skins, who could urge a patriotic interest, impossible for me, in the place. One is, of course, used to all sorts of alien shapes in Central Park, but there they are somehow at once less surprising and less significant than these Asian and African forms; they will presently be Americans, and like the rest of us; but those dark imperialings were already British and eternally un-English. They frequented the tea-tables spread in pleasant shades and shelters, and ate buns and bread-and-butter, like their fellow-subjects, but their dark liquid eyes roamed over the blue and gold and pink of the English complexions with an effect of mystery irreconcilable forever with the matter-of-fact mind behind their bland masks. We called them Burmese, Eurasians, Hindoos, Malays, and fatigued ourselves with guessing at them so that we were faint for the tea from which they kept us at the crowded tables in the gardens or on the verandas of the tea-houses. But we were not so insatiable of them as of their fellow-subjects, the native British whom one sees at a Sunday of the Zoo to perhaps special advantage. Our Sunday was in the season, and the season had conjecturably qualified it, so that one could sometimes feel oneself in company better than one's own. The children were well-dressed and admirably well-behaved; they justly outnumbered their elders, and it was obviously their day. But it was also the day of their elders, who had made excuse of the children's pleasure in coming to the Zoo for their own. Some indeed were not so much their elders, and the young aunts and uncles, who were naturally cousins, lost themselves at times a little way from the children and maids, in the quieter walks or nooks, or took boat to be alone on the tranquil waters with one another. They were then more interesting than the strangest Malays and Hindoos, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> these made of them, as they contemplated their segregation with the other thronging spectators.|$|E
5000|$|... "I have no {{knowledge}} of this surveyor <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> he said, that we studied Vieta's work together in Paris, because it is a book which I cannot remember having seen the cover, while I was in France." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I say, old man, after all, {{the regular}} straight-out American style lays over all their foreign flops <b>and</b> fandoodles. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> old Brimmer {{would say to}} his wife's full-dress nightgown--eh?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{went to the}} old Orso's apartments, {{and found}} {{everything}} quiet; I lay down on a couch outside the doors and tried to sleep; but my thoughts troubled me. My mind was with the sad horsemen galloping through the night, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> the morrow had in store for them <b>and</b> me. <b>I</b> knew a price would be set upon my head, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had to remain here {{in the midst of}} my enemies as the only protection of an old man of eighty-five.|$|R
