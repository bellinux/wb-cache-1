We construct a binomial tree for the forward risk <b>adjusted</b> <b>tree</b> and calculate analytically the expected early exercise value in each point. For American puts with stochastic interest rates the correlation between the stock price process has different influences on the European option values and the early exercise premiums. This results in a nonmonotonic relation between this correlation and the American put option value. Furthermore, there is evidence that the early exercise premium due to stochastic interest rates is much larger than established before by other researchers...|$|E

40|$|Gene tree parsimony, which infers {{a species}} tree that implies the fewest gene duplications across a {{collection}} of gene trees, is a method for inferring phylogenetic trees from paralogous genes. However, it assumes that all duplications are independent, and therefore, it {{does not account for}} large-scale gene duplication events like whole genome duplications. We describe two methods to infer species trees based on gene duplication events that may involve multiple genes. First, gene episode parsimony seeks the species tree that implies the fewest possible gene duplication episodes. Second, <b>adjusted</b> gene <b>tree</b> parsimony corrects the number of gene duplications at each node in the species tree by treating the largest possible gene duplication episode as a single duplication. We test both new methods, as well as gene tree parsimony, using 7, 091 gene trees representing 7 plant taxa. Gene <b>tree</b> parsimony and <b>adjusted</b> gene <b>tree</b> parsimony both perform well, returning the species tree after an exhaustive search of the tree space. By contrast, gene episode parsimony fails to rank the true species tree within the top third of all possible topologies. Furthermore, gene trees with randomly permuted leaf labels can imply fewer duplication episodes than gene trees with the correct leaf labels. <b>Adjusted</b> gene <b>tree</b> parsimony reflects a potentially more realistic and, at least for small data sets, computationally feasible model for counting gene duplication events than treating each duplication independently or minimizing the number of possible duplication episodes...|$|R

40|$|In {{post-mortem}} tissue studies that compare regional brain biomarkers across different mental disorder diagnostic groups, subjects are often matched on several demographic characteristics and measured on additional covariates. The goal {{of our research}} is to integrate the results from these types of studies using two commonly used statistical discrimination techniques, namely, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and classification trees based on the algorithm developed by Breiman, Friedman, Olshen, and Stone (BFOS), to identify the most discriminatory subset of biomarkers. Subject matching and covariate effects don't appear in the literature implementing these discriminatory methods {{in the analysis of}} {{post-mortem tissue}} studies (e. g., Knable et al. 2001; Knable et al. 2002). Although there are methods that have been developed for LDA to account for covariate effects on the response or feature variables of interest, none of these methods addresses the fact that individuals may also be matched across several groups. One aspect of our research extends this work to handle group matching. To develop the theoretical foundations required to account for covariate effects in classification trees, we describe how to implement the BFOS algorithm, which is non-parametric and traditionally implemented in a data based setting, when the feature variables come from a known distribution. We then extend this algorithm to the case where the feature variables come from a known distribution, conditional on a covariate value. From this development, we carefully formulate a semi-parametric model for the conditional distribution of the feature variables that allows the use of the BFOS algorithm to construct a covariate <b>adjusted</b> <b>tree</b> based on one unique set of feature variables, in both a theoretical setting and in the context of training data. Finally, the tree construction procedure we develop using this conditional model is extended to handle group matching. Our adjustment methodology is successfully applied to a series of post-mortem tissue studies conducted by Sweet et al. (2003, 2004, 2007, 2008) comparing several neurobiological characteristics of schizophrenia subjects and normal controls, and to a post-mortem tissue study conducted by Konopaske et al.

40|$|International audienceThe {{increase}} in the number of large data sets and the complexity of current probabilistic sequence evolution models necessitates fast and reliable phylogeny reconstruction methods. We describe a new approach, based on the maximumlikelihood principle, which clearly satisfies these requirements. The core of this method is a simple hill-climbing algorithm that <b>adjusts</b> <b>tree</b> topology and branch lengths simultaneously. This algorithm starts from an initial tree built by a fast distance-based method and modifies this tree to improve its likelihood at each iteration. Due to this simultaneous adjustment of the topology and branch lengths, only a few iterations are sufficient to reach an optimum. We used extensive and realistic computer simulations to show that the topological accuracy of this new method is at least as high as that of the existing maximum-likelihood programs and much higher than the performance of distance-based and parsimony approaches. The reduction of computing time is dramatic in comparison with other maximum-likelihood packages, while the likelihood maximization ability tends to be higher. For example, only 12 min were required on a standard personal computer to analyze a data set consisting of 500 rbcL sequences with 1, 428 base pairs fromplant plastids, thus reaching a speed of the same order as some popular distance-based and parsimony algorithms.

We tested three foraging strategies that explain how Magellanic woodpeckers (Campephilus magellanicus) assess the relative quality of trees: 1) Woodpeckers with local knowledge select trees based on the available trees in the immediate vicinity. 2) Woodpeckers lacking local knowledge select trees based on their availability at previously visited locations. 3) Woodpeckers using information from long-term memory select trees based on knowledge about trees available within the entire landscape. We observed foraging woodpeckers and used a Brownian Bridge Movement Model to identify trees available to woodpeckers along foraging routes. Woodpeckers selected trees with a later decay stage than available trees. Selection models indicated that preferences of Magellanic woodpeckers were based on clusters of trees near the most recently visited trees, thus suggesting that woodpeckers use visual cues from neighboring trees. In a second analysis, Cox's proportional hazards models showed that woodpeckers used information consolidated across broader spatial scales to <b>adjust</b> <b>tree</b> residence times. Specifically, woodpeckers spent more time at trees with larger diameters and in a more advanced stage of decay than trees available along their routes.

This approach has the virtue of simplicity but does not account for the three-dimensional attributes of a tree crown, the multivariate nature of the crown variables, or variability among species.

These include crown volume, crown surface area, and crown production efficiency. These indicators were then standardized to a mean of 0 and variance of 1 to enable direct comparison among species.

Distributional properties were examined for the three composite crown indicators and their standardized-residualized counterparts for 6167 trees from 250 permanent plots distributed across Virginia, Georgia, and Alabama.
