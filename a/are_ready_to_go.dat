5|$|Cats <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to {{new homes}} at about 12 weeks of age, {{when they are}} ready to leave their mother. They can be surgically sterilized (spayed or castrated) as early as 7 weeks to limit {{unwanted}} reproduction. This surgery also prevents undesirable sex-related behavior, such as aggression, territory marking (spraying urine) in males and yowling (calling) in females. Traditionally, this surgery was performed at around six to nine months of age, but it is increasingly being performed prior to puberty, at about three to six months. In the US, about 80% of household cats are neutered.|$|E
5|$|From {{the moment}} the egg is hatched, the male {{macaroni}} penguin cares for the newly hatched chick. For about 23 to 25 days, the male protects its offspring and helps to keep it warm, since {{only a few of}} its feathers have grown in by this time. The female brings food to the chick every one to two days. When they are not being protected by the adult male penguins, the chicks form crèches to keep warm and stay protected. Once their adult feathers have grown in at about 60 to 70days, they <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out to sea on their own.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of their}} large size, king penguin chicks take 14–16 months before they <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to sea. This is {{markedly}} different from smaller penguins, who rear their chicks through a single summer when food is plentiful. King penguins time their mating so the chicks will develop over the harshest season for fishing. In this way, {{by the time}} the young penguins are finally mature enough to leave their parents, it is summer when food is plentiful and conditions are more favorable for the young to survive alone.|$|E

25|$|Mating {{is mainly}} {{done during the}} month of April, after mating the male has minimal to no role in the new baby spiders life. The female is the main {{caregiver}} for the young, before laying the eggs she will make a silk pouch to protect and give shelter to the eggs, up to 70 eggs can be produced at once. The female will stay in the silk pouch with the eggs, protecting, and waiting for them to hatch. After hatching the mother cares for her new babies and will stay together until they <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out on their own. The spider's bite is not poisonous to people but is painful do to their large fangs and wide jaw. However, the bite does leave an itchy, swollen, red bump.|$|E
