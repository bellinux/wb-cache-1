40|$|The genetic {{improvement}} of agriculturally important species and disease control are of fundamental {{importance to the}} success of a sustainable agri-food industry. In this sense, artificial insemination (AI) is arguably the most important tool contributing to the advancement of modern animal production. Through AI, 1 ejaculate from a genetically superior male can be used to impregnate multiple females to maximize the distribution of agriculturally favorable genes. As well, AI eliminates physical contact between animals, thus limiting the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. Successful semen cryopreservation enhances these advantages of AI over natural breeding. Long-term storage facilitates semen transport over distances, permits the quarantine of semen, and enables extended use of superior germplasm, even after the sire’s death. For agriculturally important animals, semen cryopreservation is an established industry worldwide, particularly for dairy cattle. Genome resource banking to preserve the biodiversity of endangered species or valuable transgenic lines also would benefit from sperm cryopreservation. For many mammals; however, effective semen cryopreservation is not a reality because a large number of sperm are apparently infertile following freezing and thawing. Compared to fresh, 8 times more cryopreserved bovine sperm were required to achieve equivalent fertilization rates in vivo (Shannon and Vishwanath, 1995). Although <b>AI</b> <b>in</b> <b>pigs</b> with fresh, cooled semen is increasingly popular, the fertility of cryopreserved semen remains about half that of fresh semen (Crabo, 1991).

40|$|Civilizations {{throughout}} the world continue to depend on pig meat as an important food source. Approximately 40 % of the red meat consumed annually worldwide (94 million metric tons) is pig meat. Pig numbers (940 million) and consumption have increased consistent with the increasing world population (FAO 2002). In the past 50 years, research guided genetic selection and nutrition programs have had {{a major impact on}} improving carcass composition and efficiency of production in swine. The use of artificial insemination (AI) in Europe has also had a major impact on pig improvement in the past 35 years and more recently in the USA. Several scientific advances in gamete physiology and/or manipulation have been successfully utilized while others are just beginning to be applied at the production level. Semen extenders that permit the use of fresh semen for more than 5 days post-collection are largely responsible for the success of <b>AI</b> <b>in</b> <b>pigs</b> worldwide. Transfer of the best genetics has been enabled by use of AI with fresh semen, and to some extent, by use of AI with frozen semen over the past 25 years. Sexed semen, now a reality, has the potential for increasing the rate of genetic progress in AI programs when used in conjunction with newly developed low sperm number insemination technology. Embryo cryopreservation provides opportunities for international transport of maternal germplasm worldwide; non-surgical transfer of viable embryos in practice is nearing reality. While production of transgenic animals has been successful, the low level of efficiency in producing these animals and lack of information on multigene interactions limit the use of the technology in applied production systems. Technologies based on research in functional genomics, proteomics and cloning have significant potential, but considerable research effort will be required before they can be utilized for AI in pig production. In the past 15 years, there has been a coordinated worldwide scientific effort to develop the genetic linkage map of the pig with the goal of identifying pigs with genetic alleles that result in improved growth rate, carcass quality, and reproductive performance. Molecular genetic tests have been developed to select pigs with improved traits such as removal of the porcine stress (RYR 1) syndrome, and selection for specific estrogen receptor (ESR) alleles. Less {{progress has been made in}} developing routine tests related to diseases. Major research in genomics is being pursued to improve the efficiency of selection for healthier pigs with disease resistance properties. The sequencing of the genome of the pig to identify new genes and unique regulatory elements holds great promise to provide new information that can be used in pig production. AI, in vitro embryo production and embryo transfer will be the preferred means of implementing these new technologies to enhance efficiency of pig production in the future...|$|E

Extended liquid boar semen {{may be used for}} insemination for up to 5 days after collection. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the changes in sperm quality, when boar semen was extended and stored at 18 °C for up to 72 h post-collection. The study included three ejaculates from five boars, for each of the four breeds: Duroc, Hampshire, Landrace and Danish Large White (n = 60 ejaculates). The sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA) showed an increase in DNA fragmentation index (DFI) after 72 h of incubation (P < 0. 001), with no differences between breeds (P = 0. 07). For two Hampshire boars, all ejaculates had a large increase in DFI after 24 h of incubation. The standard deviation of DFI (SD-DFI) differed between breeds, with the SD-DFI for Hampshire being significantly greater than for the other breeds. The SD-DFI did not change during the 72 h of storage. Sperm viability was determined using SYBR- 14 and propidium iodide in combination with flow cytometry. The sperm viability did not differ between breeds (P = 0. 21), but a difference in viability during storage (P < 0. 001) was detected. In conclusion, the SCSA cytogram patterns were consistent for different ejaculates within boars and storage of extended boar semen at 18 °C for 72 h significantly decreased the integrity of sperm DNA...|$|R

PROCEDURE: The unrestrained heads of six, anaesthetised, 7 - to 8 -week-old, Large White <b>pigs</b> were impacted <b>in</b> the temporal region with a nonpenetrating captive bolt pistol.

The neuronal response patterns <b>in</b> the <b>AI</b> correlated well with the sound temporal envelope of chirp (an isolated short phrase), but correlated less well in the case of chutter and whistle (longer calls) or purr (a call with a fast repetition rate of phrases).

40|$|Frozen-thawed (FT) boar semen for {{artificial}} insemination (<b>AI)</b> <b>in</b> commercial <b>pig</b> production is still only used in exceptional cases, mostly for incorporation of top genetics. Low sperm survival after a freezing procedure {{that is still}} considered suboptimal, which results in low farrowing rates and small litter sizes when conventional cervical AI is performed, are among the reasons why FT boar semen is rarely used <b>in</b> <b>AI.</b> Compensatory attempts include AI with large sperm numbers, which, however, reduces the number of doses produced per ejaculate. New procedures for intra-uterine AI are now available, opening up possibilities for the deposition of smaller volumes (thus diminishing semen reflux) and therefore lower total sperm numbers per dose, provided these spermatozoa (spz) can be packed in a higher density and sustain cryopreservation (i. e. provided they have an acceptable survival rate post-thaw). This thesis includes a summarised review of available literature on the history, as well as constraints on and future prospects {{of the use of}} frozen boar semen <b>in</b> <b>AI.</b> Also, a trial is reported whose aim was to concentrate (2 x 109 spz/mL) and freeze boar spermatozoa packed in either 0. 5 ml volume medium straws (MS) or a multiple FlatPack (MFP) (four 0. 7 ml volume segments of a single FlatPack [SFP]) intended as AI doses for intra-uterine AI. A single, well-proved freezing protocol was followed using a SFP (5 x 109 spz/ 5 ml) as control package and sperm concentration. Sperm motility was measured by computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) while plasma membrane integrity was assessed with the SYBR- 14 /PI assay combined with flow cytometry, and with a rapid hypo-osmotic swelling test (sHOST), in order to establish sperm viability. Sperm motility did not differ statistically (NS) between the test-packages and the control, neither in terms of overall sperm motility (range of means: 37 - 46 %) nor sperm velocity. Percentages of linear motile spermatozoa (LIN), however, were significantly higher in controls (SFP) than in the test packages. Spermatozoa frozen in the SFP (control) and MFP depicted the highest percentages of PMI (54 and 49 % respectively) compared to straws (38 %, p< 0. 05) when measured with flow cytometry. In absolute numbers, more viable spermatozoa were present in the MFP dose post-thaw than in the MS (p< 0. 05). Inter-boar variation was present, albeit only significant for MS (sperm motility) and SFP (PMI). In conclusion, the results indicate that boar spermatozoa can be successfully frozen if concentrated in a small volume...|$|R

40|$|Objective—To assess <b>in</b> <b>pigs</b> the {{pathogenicity}} and virulence of 3 {{strains of}} Salmonella spp capable of causing atypical salmonellosis in cattle. Animals— 36 Holstein calves and 72 pigs experimentally infected with Salmonella spp Procedures—Representative Salmonella strains associated with 3 new disease phenotypes (protozoa-mediated hypervirulence, multisystemic cytopathicity, and encephalopathy) {{that have been}} characterized in cattle during the past 10 years were orally inoculated into pigs. Clinical manifestations were compared with those observed in cattle.

The {{development}} of liver lesions in mice infected with Ascaris mum is described and {{compared to the}} lesions <b>in</b> <b>pigs.</b> The findings suggest that liver necroses in mice are initially periacinar (centrilobular), caused by anoxia resulting from a vascular obstruction by the A. suum larvae located in the sinusoids; and that the lesions <b>in</b> <b>pigs</b> following a primary infection have a different pathogenesis. It is concluded that mice are unsuitable models for studying the pathogenesis of A. suum-induced liver lesions <b>in</b> <b>pigs.</b> The common occurrence of the large intestinal nematode Ascaris mum <b>in</b> <b>pigs</b> and the great medical and economic problems involved have promoted intensive research in porcine ascariasis for decades.
