40|$|The {{existence}} of globally-distributed species with low dispersal capabilities is a paradox {{that has been}} explained {{as a result of}} human-mediated transport and by hidden diversity in the form of unrecognized cryptic species. Both factors are not mutually exclusive, but relatively few studies have demonstrated the presence of both. Here we analyse the genetic patterns of the colonial ascidian Diplosoma listerianum, a species nowadays distributed globally. The study of a fragment of a mitochondrial gene in localities worldwide revealed the {{existence of}} multiple cryptic species. In addition, we found a complex geographic structure and multiple clades occurred in sympatry. One of the species showed strong population structure irrespective of geographical distances, which is coherent with stochastic dispersal linked to human transport. The present study shows the complexity of discerning the role of cryptic diversity from human-driven range shifts worldwide, as well as disentangling the effects of natural and <b>artificial</b> <b>dispersal...</b>|$|E
40|$|Methods {{to improve}} the {{recovery}} of reindeer lichen after soil disturbance or overgrazing are being sought for areas where reindeer are herded. The effects of four substrates – mineral soil, moss, twigs and pine bark – on the establishment of lichen fragments after total removal of the vegetation were thus studied in a middle-aged pine stand and a clear-cut, both located in a lichen-rich pine-heath. Cladina mitis fragments of two sizes were manually dispersed in 1 m 2 quadrats and their movements from their respective dispersal points were registered after one year. The natural re-establishment of lichens in the quadrats was monitored over three years by using digital pictures. In the forest stand, {{no significant differences were}} detected in either the fragment movement or the lichen establishment between the different substrates, but the fragment size had positive effects on both parameters. In the clear-cut, the moss substrate was the most suitable not only for the artificially dispersed lichens to fasten to, but also for the natural settlement of lichens from the surrounding lichen mat. More lichen thalli fastened to the bark and twigs substrates than to the mineral soil, but the settlement of lichens from the surrounding was greater on bare mineral soil substrate. The results indicate that <b>artificial</b> <b>dispersal</b> of lichen thalli on an appropriate substrate could be a successful strateg...|$|E

5|$|A {{disaster}} {{struck the}} colony on 13 August 2010, when a forest fire {{swept through the}} breeding site killing three adults and 25 of the 38 chicks. The fire destroyed the vegetation and several nesting burrows. Conservation action to protect the 13 remaining chicks included removing dead birds and burnt vegetation, reinforcing the surviving nests, and setting poison bait for rats around the now exposed nest sites. In the longer term, the action plan includes the provision of <b>artificial</b> burrows, seed <b>dispersal</b> to help the vegetation recover, {{and the use of}} anti-erosion materials.|$|R
40|$|Restoration of unobstructed, {{free-flowing}} {{sections of}} river can provide considerable environmental and ecological benefits. It removes impediments to aquatic species dispersal and improves flow, sediment and nutrient transport. This, in turn, {{can serve to}} improve environmental quality and abundance of native species, not only within the river channel itself, but also within adjacent riparian, floodplain and coastal areas. In support of this effort, a generic optimization model is {{presented in this paper}} for prioritizing the removal of problematic structures, which adversely affect aquatic species dispersal and river hydrology. Its purpose is to maximize, subject to a budget, the size of the single largest section of connected river unimpeded by <b>artificial</b> flow and <b>dispersal</b> barriers. The model is designed to improve, in a holistic way, the connectivity and environmental status of a river network. Furthermore, unlike most previous prioritization methods, it is particularly well suited {{to meet the needs of}} potamodromous fish species and other resident aquatic organisms, which regularly disperse among different parts of a river network. After presenting an initial mixed integer linear programming formulation of the model, more scalable reformulation and solution techniques are investigated for solving large, realistic-sized instances. Results from a case-study of the Pike River Watershed, located in northeast Wisconsin, USA, demonstrate the computational efficiency of the proposed model as well as highlight some general insights about systematic barrier removal planning...|$|R
40|$|Microbes are {{considered}} to have a global distribution due to their high dispersal capabilities. However, {{our knowledge of the}} way geographically distant microbial communities assemble after dispersal in a new environment is limited. In this study, we examined whether communities would converge because similar taxa would be selected under the same environmental conditions, or would diverge because of initial community composition, after <b>artificial</b> <b>dispersal.</b> To this aim, a microcosm experiment was performed, in which the temporal changes in the composition and diversity of different prokaryoplankton assemblages from three distant geographic coastal areas (Banyuls-sur-Mer in northwest Mediterranean Sea, Pagasitikos Gulf in northeast Mediterranean and Woods Hole, MA, USA in the northwest Atlantic), were studied. Diversity was investigated using amplicon pyrosequencing of the V 1 -V 3 hypervariable regions of the 16 S rRNA. The three assemblages were grown separately in particle free and autoclaved Banyuls-sur-mer seawater at 18 °C in the dark. We found that the variability of prokaryoplankton community diversity (expressed as richness, evenness and dominance) as well as the composition were driven by patterns observed in Bacteria. Regarding community composition, similarities were found between treatments at family level. However, at the OTU level microbial communities from the three different original locations diverge rather than converge during incubation. It is suggested that slight differences in the composition of the initial prokaryoplankton communities, resulted in separate clusters the following days even when growth took place under identical abiotic conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{decrease}} {{in number and}} area of managed hay-meadows over the last century, {{in combination with the}} reduction of traditional management, threatens the biodiversity connected to these habitats. I experimentally examined how management intensity affected meadow characteristics and long-term population viability of three vascular plant species in wooded hay-meadows on the Swedish island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. I discovered that intensified management (extra raking and/or extra mowing) reduced the amount of litter and biomass, even in well-managed meadows. The effects of intensified management on population growth rate varied among species. Deterministic demographic models revealed that intensified management increased population growth rate in Succisa pratensis. Stochastic modelling confirmed this; all meadows displayed larger projected population sizes 50 years into the future with intensified management. Polygala amarella responded with lower growth rates in raked plots, a consequence of the plant’s morphology, which makes it prone to being pulled out by raking. Hypochoeris maculata had population growth rates close to unity, and showed no response to an increase in management. Examination of the life-history characteristics of Polygala amarella showed that the species’ strategy is aimed at reproduction and fast growth, which is in contrast to the other two species, with their success relying on the survival of older plants. The species-specific responses to management show that several species should be considered when evaluating management practices for conservation of semi-natural grasslands. Furthermore, I suggest that data on stage distributions alone may not be sufficient for identifying threatened populations. In a study of <b>artificial</b> <b>dispersal</b> between meadows, I found that establishment was twice as successful for planted plug-plants compared to sown seeds. Both methods may be useful for introducing or augmenting meadow populations, depending on access to seed sources and possibilities to nurse plants. An electronic coordinate measurement device for gathering location data to be used in demographic studies was developed. In the field, the device proved to be a simple and reliable method for locating individuals in permanent plots...|$|E
40|$|In {{northern}} Sweden, conventional {{forest regeneration}} procedures applied in modern commercial forestry can disturb terricolous lichen (Cladina spp.) pastures. This {{has become a}} source of conflicts with Sámi reindeer herders. The overall aim of this thesis was to investigate forest regeneration strategies that may minimise the disturbance to, and promote the regeneration of, reindeer lichen pastures. The Sámi herders’ practices and knowledge related to the lichen resources were also analysed. Effects of gentle soil preparation methods on the re-establishment of lichen cover, reindeer grazing and establishment of Pinus sylvestris planted seedlings were studied in a field experiment. Using the HuMinMix-technique to mix the lichen mat with humus and mineral soil (humix-substrate), was found to promote lichen mat recovery more effectively than conventional scarification. Seedling establishment was highest for mounding and tracks with mineral soil. Rates of seedlings mechanically damaged, possibly caused by reindeer trampling in winter, indicates that planting on densely grazed areas should be avoided to minimize sources of conflict and to prefer either direct seeding or natural regeneration instead. According to a survey, complete re-establishment of the lichen mat after soil preparation was estimated to take about one decade on humix-substrate, compared to probably more than five decades following conventional harrowing. Possibilities for <b>artificial</b> <b>dispersal</b> of reindeer lichen, e. g. in areas disturbed by conventional soil preparation, were also studied. The substrate was identified as a key factor for lichen establishment. In this regard, mineral soil was identified as a poor substrate for reindeer lichen immobilization, while milled organic materials, such as moss, were suitable substrates for lichen immobilization and growth. All dispersal methods tested resulted in lichen establishment, but transplanted lichen cushions were heavily depleted by reindeer grazing, while fragmented lichen thalli were much less affected. A study based on ethnolinguistics demonstrated that whereas the Western use of the word ‘pasture’ is often associated with a specific plant community, Sámi herders’ understanding of the word (guohtun in Sámi) also incorporates the effect of snow on grazing. Sámi herders use their knowledge of the effects of forest trees and other vegetation on snow conditions, to strategically plan reindeer grazing during winter. Sámi herders’ knowledge of winter pastures should therefore be integrated with information on the effects of forest regeneration procedures on stand development to develop strategies that meet the needs of both commercial forestry and the reindeer herders...|$|E
40|$|Freshwater {{and marine}} sediments often harbor {{reservoirs}} of plant diaspores, from which germination and establishment may occur whenever the sediment falls dry. Therewith, they form valuable records of historical inter- and intraspecific diversity, and are increasingly exploited to facilitate diversity establishment in new or restored nature areas. Yet, while ferns may constitute a considerable {{part of a}} vegetation's diversity and sediments are known to contain fern spores, {{little is known about}} their longevity, which may suffer from inundation and [...] in sea bottoms [...] salt stress. We tested the potential of ferns to establish from a sea or lake bottom, using experimental studies on spore survival and gametophyte formation, as well as a spore bank analysis on sediments from a former Dutch inland sea. Our experimental results revealed clear differences among species. For Asplenium scolopendrium and Gymnocarpium dryopteris, spore germination was not affected by inundated storage alone, but decreased with rising salt concentrations. In contrast, for Asplenium trichomanes subsp. quadrivalens germination decreased following inundation, but not in response to salt. Germination rates decreased with time of storage in saline water. Smaller and less viable gametophytes were produced when saline storage lasted for a year. Effects on germination and gametophyte development clearly differed among genotypes of A. scolopendrium. Spore bank analyses detected no viable spores in marine sediment layers. Only two very small gametophytes (identified as Thelypteris palustris via DNA barcoding) emerged from freshwater sediments. Both died before maturation. We conclude that marine, and likely even freshwater sediments, will generally be of little value for long-term storage of fern diversity. The development of any fern vegetation on a former sea floor will depend heavily on the deposition of spores onto the drained land by natural or <b>artificial</b> means of <b>dispersal...</b>|$|R
