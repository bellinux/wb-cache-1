Schwahn spoke of seeing himself in Mouth. Norris said that, during the spring break in his junior year at school, when the pilot for One Tree Hill came up, he drove alone to the casting director and Mark Schwahn. [...] " [...] was easy for me to play because I was this big college basketball fan, and I even wore my college team t-shirt to the audition," [...] said Norris, adding that [...] "at the end of the day, I think Mouth always remains a good guy in his heart and it's <b>absolutely</b> <b>good</b> to play that, because you feel good when you have a character like that on TV. Even if he doesn't always do the right thing, you know it's coming from a good place." [...] Mouth is unlucky in love.|$|E

6000|$|For, did {{it never}} strike you, again--as it has me--and {{all the world}} has looked {{different}} to me since I found it out--that there must be ONE, in whom all goodness is gathered together; ONE, who must be perfectly and <b>absolutely</b> <b>good?</b> And did it never strike you, that all the goodness in the world must, {{in some way or}} other, come from HIM? I believe that our hearts and reasons, if we will listen fairly to them, tell us that it must be so; and I am certain that the Bible tells us so, from beginning to end. When we see the million rain- drops of the shower, we say, with reason, there must be one great sea from which all these drops have come. When we see the countless rays of light, we say, with reason, there must be one great central sun from which all these are shed forth. And when we see, as it were, countless drops, and countless rays of goodness scattered about in the world, a little good in this man, and a little good in that, shall we not say, there must be one great sea, one central sun of goodness, from whence all human goodness comes?

His sister in commenting on this period said, [...] "The fact was, poor boy, he had outgrown his social surroundings. They were <b>absolutely</b> <b>good,</b> but they were narrow; it could not be otherwise; he chafed under them." [...] Furthermore, the youth, before he had found his real work as a poet, was restless, irritable, and opinionated; and an ever-present cause of friction was the fact that there were few subjects of taste on which he and his father did not disagree. Their poetic tastes were especially at variance. The father counted Pope supreme in poetry, and it was many years before he could take pleasure in the form in which his son's genius expressed itself. All the more noteworthy, then, is the generosity with which Mr. Browning looked after his son's interests through the unprofitable early years of his poetic career, a generosity never lost sight of by the son. Mr. Sharp in his Life of Browning records some words uttered by Mr. Browning a week or two before his death, which show how permanent was his sense of indebtedness to his father. [...] "It would have been quite unpardonable in my case," [...] he said, [...] "not to have done my best. My dear father put me in a condition most favorable for the best work I was capable of. When I think of the many authors who have had to fight their way through all sorts of difficulties, I have no reason to be proud of my achievements.... He secured for me all the care and comfort that a literary man needs to do good work. It would have been shameful if I had not done my best to realize his expectations of me." ...|$|E
40|$|How {{and why do}} {{institutional}} architectures, and {{the roles}} of private institutions therein, differ across separate areas of climate governance? Here, institutional complexity is {{explained in terms of}} the problem-structural characteristics of an issue area and the associated demand for, and supply of, private authority. These characteristics can help explain the degree of centrality of intergovernmental institutions, as well as the distribution of governance functions between these and private governance institutions. This framework is applied to three emerging areas of climate governance: reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs), and climate engineering. Conflicts over means and values, as well as over relatively and <b>absolutely</b> assessed <b>goods,</b> lead to considerable variations in the emergence and roles of private institutions across these three cases...|$|R

It {{seems to}} him, once on a time, right and {{necessary}} that Sir William Molesworth should be returned for Leeds; and Nicoll having so determined, [...] "throws himself, body and soul, into the contest, with such ardour, {{that his wife}} afterwards said (and we can well believe it) that if Sir William had failed, Robert would have died on the instant!"--why not? Having once {{made up his mind}} that that was the just and right thing, the thing which was <b>absolutely</b> <b>good</b> for Leeds, and the human beings who lived in it, was it not a thing to die for, even if it had been but the election of a new beadle? The advanced sentry is set to guard some obscure worthless dike-end--obscure and worthless in itself, but to him a centre of infinite duty. True, the fate of the camp does not depend on its being taken; if the enemy round it, there are plenty behind to blow them out again. But that is no reason whatsoever why he, before any odds, should throw his musket over his shoulder, and retreat gracefully to the lines. He was set there to stand by that, whether dike-end or representation of Leeds; that is the right thing for him; and for that right he will fight, and if he be killed, die. So have all brave men felt, and so have all brave deeds been done, since man walked the earth. It is because that spirit, the spirit of faith, has died out among us, that so few brave deeds are done now, except on battle-fields and in hovels, whereof none but God and the angels know.|$|E
60|$|Both swords were unsheathed, and {{the combatants}} {{commenced}} their engagement. Halbert became immediately aware, that, {{as he had}} expected, he was far inferior to his adversary {{in the use of}} his weapon. Sir Piercie Shafton had taken no more than his own share of real merit, when he termed himself an <b>absolutely</b> <b>good</b> fencer; and Glendinning soon found that he should have great difficulty in escaping with life and honour from such a master of the sword. The English knight was master of all the mystery of the stoccata, imbrocata, punto-reverso, incartata, and so forth, which the Italian masters of defence had lately introduced into general practice. But Glendinning, on his part, was no novice in the principles of the art, according to the old Scottish fashion, and possessed the first of all qualities, a steady and collected mind. At first, being desirous to try the skill, and become acquainted with the play of his enemy, he stood on his defence, keeping his foot, hand, eye, and body, in perfect unison, and holding his sword short, and with the point towards his antagonist's face, so that Sir Piercie, in order to assail him, was obliged to make actual passes, and could not avail himself of his skill in making feints; while, on the other hand, Halbert was prompt to parry these attacks, either by shifting his ground or with the sword. The consequence was, that after two or three sharp attempts on the part of Sir Piercie, which were evaded or disconcerted by the address of his opponent, he began to assume the defensive in his turn, fearful of giving some advantage by being repeatedly the assailant. But Halbert was too cautious to press on a swordsman whose dexterity had already more than once placed him within a hair's breadth of death, which he had only escaped by uncommon watchfulness and agility.|$|E
60|$|First: I cannot {{think that}} he had to treat his own sacred books unfairly, to make them agree with the root-idea of Socrates and Plato. Socrates and Plato {{acknowledged}} a Divine teacher of the human spirit; that was the ground of their philosophy. So did the literature of the Jews. Socrates and Plato, with all the Greek sages till the Sophistic era, held that the object of philosophy was the search after that which truly exists: that he who found that, found wisdom: Philo's books taught him the same truth: but they taught him also, that the search for wisdom was not merely the search for that which is, but for Him who is; not for a thing, but for a person. I do not mean that Plato and the elder Greeks had not that object also in view; for I have said already that Theology was with them the ultimate object of all metaphysic science: but I do think that they saw it infinitely less clearly than the old Jewish sages. Those sages were utterly unable to conceive of an absolute truth, except as residing in an absolutely true person; of absolute wisdom, except in an absolutely wise person; of an absolute order and law, except in a lawgiver; of an absolute good, except in an <b>absolutely</b> <b>good</b> person: any more than either they or we can conceive of an absolute love, except in an absolutely loving person. I say boldly, that I think them right, on all grounds of Baconian induction. For all these qualities are only known to us as exhibited in persons; and if we believe them to have any absolute and eternal existence at all, to be objective, and independent of us, and the momentary moods and sentiments of our own mind, they must exist in some absolute and eternal person, or they are mere notions, abstractions, words, which have no counterparts.|$|E
