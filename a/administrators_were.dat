5|$|During the 1970s, Loxton {{also became}} more disillusioned with cricket, as player {{behaviour}} deteriorated and incidences of verbal hostility and altercations increased. The former all-rounder {{was known for}} his vigorous advocacy of the more sedate and gentlemanly conduct that existed during his playing days and felt that he and his fellow <b>administrators</b> <b>were</b> losing control of the sport.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, thirty former Spartan athletes, coaches, and <b>administrators</b> <b>were</b> {{inducted}} into the MSU Athletics Hall of Fame as its charter class. On October 1, 1999, the University opened its new Athletics Hall of Fame, in the Clara Bell Smith Student-Athlete Academic Center.|$|E
5|$|After the French {{defeat at}} Waterloo, the works' former owners sought their return. The Louvre's <b>administrators</b> <b>were</b> loath to comply and hid many works {{in their private}} collections. In response, foreign states sent emissaries to London to seek help, and many pieces were returned, even some that had been {{restored}} by the Louvre. In 1815 Louis XVIII finally concluded agreements with the Austrian government for the keeping of pieces such as Veronese's Wedding at Cana which was exchanged for a large Le Brun or the repurchase of the Albani collection.|$|E

50|$|Accordingly, an <b>Administrator</b> <b>is</b> {{appointed}} {{when the}} Governor-General dies, resigns or is absent from Australia. The <b>Administrator</b> <b>is</b> styled either <b>Administrator</b> of the Commonwealth or, less commonly, Administrator of the Government of the Commonwealth. By convention, the <b>Administrator</b> <b>is</b> usually the longest serving state Governor, {{who holds a}} dormant commission from the sovereign (currently Elizabeth II).|$|R
50|$|The plan <b>administrator</b> <b>is</b> {{the entity}} charged with general plan {{administration}} duties, {{similar to a}} trustee {{in the case of}} a trust. The plan <b>administrator</b> <b>is</b> always a plan fiduciary; the plan administrator can share the fiduciary duty with other entities, but the plan <b>administrator</b> <b>is</b> required to assume some fiduciary duty and cannot disclaim that duty. In general, the plan <b>administrator</b> <b>is</b> the employer - but new trends in the industry are seeing more and more groups outsourcing plan administrator duties to TPAs or other entities for a fee.|$|R
5|$|As {{the weather}} warmed and work resumed {{on the main}} pipeline, Alyeska <b>administrators</b> <b>were</b> distracted by a {{controversy}} about pipeline welds {{that had been done}} the previous year. In September 1975, a former employee of Ketchbaw Industries filed suit against the company, alleging that he had been laid off because he would not participate in a conspiracy to falsify quality control X-Rays of pipeline welds. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline was unique among pipeline projects to that point in that it required all welds of the main pipeline to be verified by X-Ray. This was a time-consuming process, and the quality-control procedures continually lagged behind the welders.|$|E
5|$|The England openers Cyril Washbrook and Len Hutton {{were given}} a loud {{reception}} as they walked out to bat, particularly the Yorkshire local Hutton. They {{had to face the}} Australian opening pair of Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller without the aid of sightscreen. It was the first time some of the Australians had played in a first-class match without a sightscreen, and those cricketers would later have to bat without its assistance. It was believed the Yorkshire <b>administrators</b> <b>were</b> reluctant to install a sightscreen as it would have taken up space and lowered the capacity of the ground, and thus the gate takings.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese, {{after their}} arrival in Sri Lanka in 1505, began a {{campaign}} of forced conversion and destruction of many Buddhist and Hindu temples around the island. They destroyed the Munneswaram temple completely in 1578 CE {{with the exception of}} the basement, and used the core of the building as a Roman Catholic chapel. Jesuits recorded that they used iron bars to destroy the presiding deity. According to a 1640 Portuguese records, they were able to convert 500 people from the village of Munneswaram as Roman Catholics. However, the locals and temple <b>administrators</b> <b>were</b> able to hide many of the idols of the temple complex before the destruction.|$|E
50|$|The <b>administrator</b> <b>was</b> appointed, by the {{national}} government, for a five-year term {{and could not be}} removed except by the Governor General for “cause assigned”. The <b>administrator</b> <b>was</b> not responsible to the provincial council and it had no power to remove him from office. The <b>administrator</b> <b>was</b> the chairman of the provincial executive committee and had both an original and casting vote in its deliberations.|$|R

5|$|Despite Singapore's growing importance, the {{administration}} governing {{the island was}} understaffed, ineffectual and unconcerned with {{the welfare of the}} populace. <b>Administrators</b> <b>were</b> usually posted from India and were unfamiliar with local culture and languages. While the population had quadrupled during 1830 to 1867, the size of the civil service in Singapore had remained unchanged. Most people had no access to public health services and diseases such as cholera and smallpox caused severe health problems, especially in overcrowded working-class areas. As a result of {{the administration}}'s ineffectiveness and the predominantly male, transient, and uneducated nature of the population, the society was lawless and chaotic. In 1850 there were only twelve police officers in the city of nearly 60,000 people. Prostitution, gambling, and drug abuse (particularly of opium) were widespread. Chinese criminal secret societies (analogous to modern-day triads) were extremely powerful, and some had tens of thousands of members. Turf wars between rival societies occasionally led to hundreds of deaths and attempts to suppress them had limited success.|$|E
5|$|Eagle Boys {{was founded}} in Albury, New South Wales by {{businessman}} Tom Potter in 1987. Since 1992, Eagle Boys national headquarters have been located in Annerley, Queensland. In 2007 NBC Capital, a Queensland-based venture capital group, bought Eagle Boys from Potter. At the chain's peak, in 2013, more than 340 Eagle Boys stores were operating across Australia. Outlet numbers fell drastically {{between the end of}} 2013 and the end of 2014 to around 170. In July 2016, fewer than 130 stores remained open and <b>administrators</b> <b>were</b> brought in to the head office to identify restructuring options ahead of a potential sale of the business, although the move did not extend to franchisee-operated outlets. In November 2016, Pizza Hut announced to media that it had merged with Eagle Boys. As at that date, 114 Eagle Boys stores operated throughout Australia; making it the fourth largest pizza chain in the country, with less than 10% share of the country's pizza market.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Imerina was governed through {{a mixture of}} traditional practices and innovative measures. While all land technically belonged to the sovereign, its administration {{was carried out by}} andriana who were assigned a menakely (subdivision of land) to govern. These <b>administrators</b> <b>were</b> themselves overseen by roving royal advisers. The land was cultivated by commoners, who were given a parcel to farm based {{on the size of the}} family it was meant to feed, and each family paid taxes to the king in return. Andrianampoinimerina passed laws giving children the right to claim meat from the butcher that had not been sold by the day's end, and allowing the poor to eat cassava from others' fields, provided they took only what they could cook and consume on the spot. In this way, the basic nutritional needs of most citizens were met.|$|E
50|$|Certain of the Administrator's {{powers and}} {{functions}} are {{set forth in}} the Tokelau Act 1948, as amended from time to time. (The office of <b>Administrator</b> <b>is</b> not, however, created by this Act.) The most important power of the <b>Administrator</b> <b>is</b> the power to disallow any Rule passed by the Parliament of Tokelau (the General Fono); this must, however, be done within 30 days after the <b>Administrator</b> <b>is</b> sent a copy of the Rule.|$|R

5|$|This success earned Thơ {{the vice}} presidential slot in December 1956 to widen the popular appeal of Diệm's nepotistic and sectarian regime. It was {{reasoned}} that Thơ's southern heritage would broaden the regime's political appeal—Diệm's family was from central Vietnam and most <b>administrators</b> <b>were</b> not from South Vietnam. Thơ {{was not allowed to}} take part in policy decisions and had little meaningful power, as Diệm's brothers, Nhu and Cẩn, commanded their own private armies and secret police, and ruled arbitrarily. Thơ oversaw South Vietnam's failed land reform policy, and was accused of lacking vigour in implementing the program as he was himself a large landowner. He was noted for his faithful support of Diệm during the Buddhist crisis that ended the rule of the Ngô family. Despite nominally being a Buddhist, Thơ defended the regime's pro-Roman Catholic policies and its violent actions against the Buddhist majority.|$|E
5|$|Though these {{measures}} were established to counter {{many of the}} irrationalities in the Soviet economic system, the reform {{did not try to}} change the existing system radically; it instead tried to improve it gradually. Success was ultimately mixed, and Soviet analyses on why the reform failed to reach its full potential have never given any definitive answers. The key factors are agreed upon, however, with blame being put on the combination of the recentralisation of the economy with the decentralisation of enterprise autonomy, creating several administrative obstacles. Additionally, instead of creating a market which in turn would establish a pricing system, <b>administrators</b> <b>were</b> given the responsibility for overhauling the pricing system themselves. Because of this, the market-like system failed to materialise. To make matters worse, the reform was contradictory at best. In retrospect, however, the Eighth Five-Year Plan as a whole is considered {{to be one of the}} most successful periods for the Soviet economy, and the most successful for consumer production.|$|E
5|$|Doris Louise Sands {{was born}} on 19 June 1921 in St. Agnes, New Providence, The Bahamas, to Sarah Elizabeth (née Fyne) and John Albert Sands. After {{completing}} her secondary education, Sands began teaching {{at the age of}} fifteen. On 3 January 1943 at Zion Baptist Church in Nassau, Sands married Ratal Allen Johnson. They subsequently had one son and Johnson worked for 17 years to earn the money to further her education. Around 1953, she was able to enroll at Virginia Union University in Richmond, Virginia, graduating with a bachelor's degree in education. She returned to the Bahamas in 1956 and joined the Progressive Liberal Party (PLP). Granted a four-year government scholarship to further her education in Canada, Johnson enrolled in a master's degree program in educational administration. Beginning her studies at MacDonald College of Education of McGill University, she earned her master's degree and began work on her doctorate at the Ontario College of Education at the University of Toronto. In the midst of her studies, the government terminated the scholarship during her third year of studying abroad, under the guise that her master's degree had been completed. Johnson believed that the scholarship was terminated because she had been active in organizing. She helped found the Women’s Suffrage Movement in the Bahamas, and in 1958 both the Bahamian Federation of Labour and the National Council of Women, traveling home intermittently during her studies to work towards enfranchisement. She returned home, but was advised that the only available positions for teaching <b>administrators</b> <b>were</b> in outlying islands.|$|E

25|$|Many Tunisians, who had {{manifested}} {{a desire}} to modernize before the French came, clearly appreciated the many improvements that the French Protectorate rather quickly accomplished, and those yet planned. Understandably, of course, they chafed at being made second-class citizens in their own country. In French public relations, the major point that would win Tunisian favor was the French ability to modernize the economy and administration. Tunisians, however, wanted {{to share in the}} work and rewards of the new French-built enterprises. Eventually, the more far-seeing among resident French <b>administrators</b> <b>were</b> drawn to draft French development plans so as to include significant participation by the Tunisian people. Nonetheless, other French <b>administrators</b> <b>were</b> more inclinded to award business and employment opportunities to French settlers, for both local political reasons and colonial policy.|$|E
25|$|I {{suspected}} {{that even the}} Australian <b>administrators</b> <b>were</b> praying for rain and the delaying of the final outcome of a series that was proving a financial bonanza.
