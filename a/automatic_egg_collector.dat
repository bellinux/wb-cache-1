50|$|Colin Watson (c. 1943 - May 24, 2006) was a British <b>egg</b> <b>collector</b> {{who stole}} the eggs of rare and wild birds from {{protected}} wildlife sites throughout Great Britain for {{over twenty years}} before his death.|$|R
25|$|The {{return of}} the goshawk as a {{breeding}} bird to Britain since 1945 is {{due in large part}} to falconers' escapes: the earlier British population was wiped out by gamekeepers and <b>egg</b> <b>collectors</b> in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|R
40|$|Reproduction in most fish is {{typically}} a seasonal process, as spawning takes place usually {{at a given}} time of the year, depending on the reproduction strategy of the species, to ensure maximal survival of offspring. Nevertheless, fish reproduction cannot be considered an exclusively annual phenomenon, because spawning may also show daily rhythmicity. In this study, we investigated the existence of a daily spawning rhythm in gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata L) exposed to different light-dark (LD) cycles and at different times of the year using an <b>automatic</b> and programmable <b>egg</b> <b>collector.</b> Floatability and fertilization rates were analyzed at different times throughout the 24 h. The results showed a daily spawning rhythm with spanning occurring from 14 : 30 to 21 : 30 h, with the acrophase (peak time) being 18 : 29 and 18 : 08 h in fish exposed to an artificial photoperiod of 9 L: 15 D in winter and in spring, respectively. Nevertheless, in fish exposed to a natural photoperiod of 12 L: 12 D in spring, the acrophase of the rhythm was recorded later, at 21 : 28 h. The average fertilization rate was 87 %, and {{no significant differences were found}} between the different hours of spawning. Moreover, when the LD cycle (9 L: 15 D) was shifted by 12 h, the daily spawning rhythm gradually re-synchronized, resuming a stable phase-relationship after 4 - 5 transient days, which is characteristic of a endogenous circadian rhythm. Our results clearly demonstrated the existence of a 24 h period of spawning in gilthead sea bream, with a peak anticipating the forthcoming night, and its capacity to gradually re-synchronize after a 12 h shift in the LD cycle, pointing to the endogenous nature of this rhythm. These findings will be valuable for better understanding the reproductive physiology of this species and for optimizing the protocols of egg collection and larvae production in aquaculture.

50|$|Egg {{collecting}} {{was still}} {{popular in the}} early 20th century, even as its scientific value became less prominent. <b>Egg</b> <b>collectors</b> built large collections and traded with one another. Frequently, collectors would go to extreme lengths to obtain eggs of rare birds. For example, Charles Bendire was willing to have his teeth broken to remove a rare egg that became stuck in his mouth. He had placed the egg in his mouth while climbing down a tree.|$|R
50|$|The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds {{has been}} {{particularly}} active in fighting illegal egg collection and maintains an investigative unit that collects intelligence on <b>egg</b> <b>collectors</b> and assists police in mounting prosecutions on them, in addition to investigating other wildlife crimes. At one point, RSPB staff were being trained by soldiers from the Brigade of Gurkhas in camouflage skills and in surveillance, map and radio techniques, to better enable them to guard nests of rare birds.|$|R

50|$|Bird cliffs, or nesting cliffs, are steep cliffs with {{numerous}} small shelves which serve as nesting locations for bird colonies. Bird cliffs are found on {{islands in the}} North Atlantic and Arctic, such as the Faroe Islands, the Svalbard archipelago and on islands off Northern Norway. Among species that nest in large numbers on bird cliffs are common murre, thick-billed murre, razorbill, kittiwake, little auk and Atlantic puffin. The number of breeding couples may exhibit large variations depending on available food. Bird cliffs have often been exploited as a food resource by the local population, {{as well as being}} used by hunters and <b>egg</b> <b>collectors.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, the main threats to western osprey populations were <b>egg</b> <b>collectors</b> and hunting {{of the adults}} along with other birds of prey, but western osprey populations {{declined}} drastically in many areas in the 1950s and 1960s; this {{appeared to be in}} part due to the toxic effects of insecticides such as DDT on reproduction. The pesticide interfered with the bird's calcium metabolism which resulted in thin-shelled, easily broken or infertile eggs. Possibly because of the banning of DDT in many countries in the early 1970s, together with reduced persecution, the osprey, as well as other affected bird of prey species, have made significant recoveries.|$|R

Loch Garten, Dyfi and the Highland Foundation for Wildlife have fitted satellite trackers to some chicks to improve understanding of migratory behaviour. The exact location of many nests is not widely disclosed due {{to the risk of}} eggs being stolen by <b>egg</b> <b>collectors</b> which, despite being made illegal in 1981 under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, continues to present a threat to rare nesting birds.|$|R

5000|$|The early re-colonisation {{was very}} slow because of {{contamination}} {{of the food chain}} by organochlorine pesticides and the activities of <b>egg</b> <b>collectors.</b> As a result the breeding population had reached only 14 pairs by 1976. To protect the birds and increase their survival rates, [...] "Operation Osprey" [...] was launched. Barbed wire and electric wires were placed around the trees the birds nested in and a watch was kept over them through the night. Fifteen years later, in 1991, the number of pairs had increased to 71. In 2001, 158 breeding pairs were located, mainly in Scotland. In 2011 RSPB estimated there were between 250 and 300 nesting pairs in Great Britain.|$|R
30|$|Broodstock {{fish were}} held in four 4.5  m 3 cylindro-conical tanks {{connected}} to a single recirculating filtration system utilizing UV, mechanical (broken glass) and biological filtration. Each tank had its own <b>egg</b> <b>collector.</b> Broodstock fish were conditioned to spawn in their tanks by maintaining water temperature at 28 - 30 °C, a level that corresponds to {{the upper end of}} the ambient temperature range experienced in south Florida coastal waters during the S. crumenophthalmus spawning season (NODC National Ocean Data Center 2010). Natural light was provided through a 95 % reflective cloth. Water exchange was approximately 20 % per day. Ammonia (NH 4) was kept below 0.5  mg l- 1. Dissolved Oxygen was maintained at or above saturation. Photoperiod was not manipulated.|$|R
50|$|However, the {{practice}} of egg collecting, or 'egging', continues as an 'underground' or illegal activity in the UK and elsewhere. In the 1980s and 1990s, the fines allowed by the law were only a moderate deterrent to some <b>egg</b> <b>collectors.</b> However, the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 allowed for six months' imprisonment for the possession of the eggs of wild birds and, since it came into force, a number of individuals have been imprisoned, both for possessing and for attempting to buy egg collections. The Jourdain Society continued to meet although membership dwindled after 1994, when a dinner of the society was raided by police, assisted by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). This resulted in six members being convicted and fined.|$|R
40|$|Natural spawnings of {{milkfish}} from floating cages {{were obtained}} from different stocks of 5 - 7 year-old milkfish in 1980, 1981, 1983 and 1985. The maximum number of eggs collected in 1980, using a series of 1 -m diameter stationary plankton nets, was about 900. Increased collections were obtained in succeeding years with different types of <b>egg</b> <b>collectors</b> and methods. <b>Egg</b> collection, however, is inferior when based on the expected number of eggs spawned by a single female. Although no systematic study was attempted to compare efficiency of various egg-collecting gears and methods, {{the problems associated with}} the use of each gear are presented. The experience may be used as a guide in future designs of efficient gears of collecting naturally-spawned eggs of milkfish or other fish species in floating cages...|$|R

5000|$|The egg {{measures}} 22 x 16 mm {{and weighs}} 3.2 g, of which 7% is shell. Research {{has shown that}} the female common cuckoo is able to keep its egg inside its body for an extra 24 hours before laying it in a host's nest. This means the cuckoo chick can hatch before the host's chicks do, and it can eject the unhatched eggs from the nest. Scientists incubated common cuckoo eggs for 24 hours at the bird's body temperature of , and examined the embryos, which were found [...] "much more advanced" [...] than those of other species studied. The idea of 'internal incubation' was first put forward in 1802 and 18th and 19th Century <b>egg</b> <b>collectors</b> had reported finding that cuckoo embryos were more advanced than those of the host species.|$|R
5|$|The heavy toll on {{breeding}} birds, {{together with}} loss of habitat through drainage and collection by nineteenth-century trophy hunters and <b>egg</b> <b>collectors,</b> {{meant that the}} species became almost extinct in England by the 1880s, although recolonisation in small numbers has occurred since 1963. The draining of wetlands from the 1800s onwards in southern Sweden {{has resulted in the}} ruff's disappearance from many areas there, although it remains common in the north of the country. The use of insecticides and draining of wetlands has led to a {{decrease in the number of}} ruff in Denmark since the early 1900s. There are still areas where the ruff and other wetland birds are hunted legally or otherwise for food. A large-scale example is the capture of more than one million waterbirds (including ruffs) in a single year from Lake Chilwa in Malawi.|$|R
5|$|Unknown biotoxins, pathogens, and the {{impairment}} of feather waterproofing {{can lead to}} hypothermia and avian cholera. Since this grebe usually winters on the coast, it is also vulnerable to oil pollution. Large-scaled deaths (such as 150,000 birds on the Salton Sea in 1992) from erysipelas, avian cholera and avian botulism have been recorded {{in the past and}} could threaten the species. These and other factors, such as human disturbance, including collisions with power transmission lines, contribute to declining populations in certain areas. This species used to be threatened in North America by the millinery industry, which helped facilitate the hunting of the birds, and <b>egg</b> <b>collectors.</b> Although this is true, this grebe is hunted in the Gilan Province in Iran, for both commercial and recreational purposes. However, there is no evidence suggesting that these threats could result in a significant risk for the overall population.|$|R
5|$|Terns {{and their}} eggs {{have long been}} eaten by humans and island colonies were raided by sailors on long voyages since the eggs or large chicks were an easily {{obtained}} source of protein. Eggs are still illegally harvested in southern Europe, and adults of wintering birds are taken as food in West Africa and South America. The roseate tern is significantly affected by this hunting, with adult survival 10% lower than would otherwise be expected. In the West Indies, the eggs of roseate and sooty terns {{are believed to be}} aphrodisiacs, and are disproportionately targeted by <b>egg</b> <b>collectors.</b> Tern skins and feathers have long been used for making items of clothing such as capes and hats, and this became a large-scale activity {{in the second half of}} the nineteenth century when it became fashionable to use feathers in hatmaking.

The chough last bred on the island in 1900. Mountain hare (apparently absent in the 18th century) and rabbit are now abundant and preyed upon by wild cat and pine marten. The rich fresh water streams contain brown trout, Atlantic salmon and water shrew. Offshore the edible crab and edible oyster are also found, the latter especially in the Sound of Scalpay. There are nationally important horse mussel and brittlestar beds in the sea lochs and in 2012 a bed of 100 million flame shells was found during a survey of Loch Alsh.

50|$|Careless {{behaviour}} {{towards the}} osprey in Britain throughout the 19th century {{meant that it}} became extinct as a breeding bird by the early 20th. However, in 1954 two Scandinavian breeding birds came to Garten completely {{of their own accord}} and set up a nest in the forest by the loch. Slowly the species recolonised Scotland (for more information see ospreys in Britain), and the RSPB and other organisations helped them along the way (not an easy task due to the illegal activities of <b>egg</b> <b>collectors</b> and other irresponsible people). The reserve was purchased by the charity and since then the nest has always been closely monitored. Recently a viewing hide was built relatively near (but not too near) to the nest so that visitors may come and see these birds of prey easily. The hide has telescopes and other optical devices inside, as well as television screens showing close-up views of the fledglings and their parents. Live video and still pictures of the nest can be viewed on the RSPB Loch Garten Reserve web-site.|$|R
40|$|The Moore <b>egg</b> <b>collector</b> (MEC) was {{developed}} for quantitative and nondestructive capture of semibuoyant fish eggs. Previous {{studies have indicated that}} capture efficiency of the MEC was low and the use of one device did not adequately represent the spatial distribution within the water column of egg surrogates (gellan beads) of pelagic broadcast-spawning cyprinids. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess whether use of multiple MECs showed differences in spatial and temporal distribution of bead catches. Capture efficiency of three MECs was tested at four 500 -m sites on the South Canadian River, a Great Plains river in Oklahoma. For each trial, approximately 100, 000 beads were released and mean capture efficiency was 0. 47 – 2. 16 %. Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests indicated the spatial distributions of bead catches were different among multiple MECs at three of four sites. Temporal variability in timing of peak catches of gellan beads was also evident between MECs. We concluded that the use of multiple MECs is necessary to properly sample eggs of pelagic broadcast-spawning cyprinid...|$|R
5000|$|The {{common loon}} {{is central to}} the plot of the children's novel Great Northern? by Arthur Ransome (in which it is {{referred}} to throughout as [...] "great northern diver", with the obsolete scientific name Colymbus immer). The story is set in the Outer Hebrides, where the main characters—a group of children on holiday—notice a pair of divers apparently nesting there. Checking their bird book, they believe that these are great northern divers. However, these have not previously been seen to nest in northern Scotland, and so they ask for help from an ornithologist. He confirms that these birds are indeed the great northern; unfortunately, it soon transpires that he does not wish merely to observe, but wants to steal the eggs and add them to his collection, and to do this, he must first kill the birds. Published in 1947, the story is one where the conservationists are the eventual victors over the <b>egg</b> <b>collector,</b> {{at a time when the}} latter hobby was not widely considered to be harmful.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{offers an}} {{examination}} of egg-collecting, which was a very popular pastime in Britain from the Victorian era well into the twentieth century. Collectors, both young and old, would often spend whole days and sometimes longer trips {{in a wide variety}} of different habitats, from sea shores to moorlands, wetlands to craggy mountainsides, searching for birds’ nests and the bounty to be found within them. Once collectors had found and taken eggs, they emptied out the contents; hence, they were really eggshell <b>collectors.</b> Some <b>egg</b> <b>collectors</b> claimed that egg-collecting was not just a hobby but a science, going by the name of oology, and seeking to establish oology as a recognised sub-discipline of ornithology, these collectors or oologists established formal institutions such as associations and societies, attended meetings where they exhibited unusual finds, and also contributed to specialist publications dedicated to oology. Egg-collecting was therefore many things at once: a culture of the British countryside, from where many eggs were taken; a culture of natural history, taking on the trappings of a science; and a culture of enthusiasm, providing a consuming passion for many collectors. By the early twentieth century, however, opposing voices were increasingly being raised, by conservation groups and other observers, about the impact that egg-collecting was having on bird populations and on the welfare of individual birds. By mid-century the tide had turned against the collectors, and egg-collecting in Britain was largely outlawed in 1954, with further restrictions imposed in 1981. While many egg collections have been lost or destroyed, some have been donated to museums, including Glasgow Museums (GM), which holds in its collections over 30, 000 eggs. As a Collaborative Doctoral Award involving the University of Glasgow and GM, the project outlined in this thesis aims to bring to light and to life these egg collections, the activities of the collectors who originally built them, and the wider world of British egg-collecting. By researching archival material held by Glasgow Museums, published specialist egg-collecting journals and other published sources, as well as the eggs as a material archive, this thesis seeks to recover some of the practices and preoccupations of <b>egg</b> <b>collectors.</b> It also recounts the practical activities carried out during the course of the project at GM, particularly those involving a collection of eggs newly donated to the museum during the course of this project, culminating in a new temporary display of birds’ eggs at Glasgow Museums Resource Centre...|$|R
