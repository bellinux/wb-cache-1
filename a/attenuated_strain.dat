25|$|Two {{additional}} {{challenges are}} found in unobserved polio transmission and in vaccine-derived poliovirus. First, most polio infections are asymptomatic or result in minor symptoms, with less than 1% of infections leading to paralysis and most infected people are unaware that they carry the disease, allowing polio to spread widely before cases are seen. And since 2000, {{there have been a}} number of outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus, following mutations or recombinations in the <b>attenuated</b> <b>strain</b> used for the oral polio vaccine, which have raised the necessity of eventually switching to the more expensive inactivated polio vaccine. The risk of vaccine-derived polio will persist long after the switch to inactivated vaccine, since a small number of chronic excretors continue to produce active virus for years (or even decades) after their initial exposure to the oral vaccine.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} growth {{temperature}} on {{the loss of}} virulence of the fish pathogen Aeromonas salmonicida was investigated. Three virulent strains were grown in Trypticase soy broth at temperatures ranging from 22 to 30 degrees C. Growth at a higher-than-optimal temperature (26 to 27 degrees C for the three strains studied) resulted {{in the selection of}} spontaneous attenuated derivatives in the initial bacterial population. For example, virulent bacteria represented less than 10 % of the population of a culture grown at 30 degrees C, and attenuated derivatives were easily isolated by streaking the culture on solid medium and picking single colonies. Virulent strains autoaggregated during growth and possessed a cell wall layer (A-layer) external to the outer membrane, as previously described. <b>Attenuated</b> <b>strains</b> did not autoaggregate and did not possess the A-layer. The A-layer apparently shielded bacteriophage receptors and a mannose-specific yeast agglutinin located in the outer membrane. Thus, virulent strains exhibited impaired adsorption of phages, whereas <b>attenuated</b> <b>strains</b> were phage sensitive. Furthermore, <b>attenuated</b> <b>strains</b> agglutinated yeast cells but virulent strains did not. The <b>attenuated</b> <b>strains</b> had higher maximum growth temperatures than their virulent parent strains, and this accounts for their selection at high temperatures. It is proposed that the A-layer contributes significantly to the physical properties of the A. salmonicida cell envelope and that these physical properties of the A. salmonicida cell envelope and that these physical change upon loss of the A-layer to permit growth at a higher-than-usual temperature...|$|R

Thus, the titers of virus {{present in the}} turbinates and lungs of virus-infected animals was measured serially for 5 days after intranasal infection, {{and the ability of}} virus strains to promote subsequent systemic bacterial infection by Haemophilus influenzae was measured at 48 h after virus infection. The results obtained were assessed with reference to the genetic constitution of the virus strains and to virus virulence for volunteers. The results showed that virulent viruses grew to relatively high titers in rat turbinates and significantly promoted systemic infection by H. influenzae. In contrast, <b>attenuated</b> <b>strains</b> grew to lower titers and failed to promote systemic H. influenzae infection. For the strains tested, the results showed clear differences for <b>attenuated</b> and virulent <b>strains,</b> and the model was a reliable indication of virulence for humans.

Animal tests showed the attenuated 17D mutant was safe and immunizing. Theiler's team rapidly completed the development of a 17D vaccine, and the Rockefeller Foundation began human trials in South America.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Recently, {{a series}} of acute swine {{erysipelas}} outbreaks occurred in Eastern China. Eight strains isolated from cases of septicemia were determined as serotype 1 a, and 4 of the isolates were resistant to acriflavine. One isolate strain named HX 130709 was attenuated on agar media containing acriflavine dye. The 432 -bp hypervariable region in spaA gene {{of the field and}} <b>attenuated</b> <b>strains</b> were amplified and sequenced. It was further compared with the vaccine strain G 4 T 10, and thus, the eight field strains can be divided into four spaA-types. The partial spaA gene analysis also showed that no point mutations occurred among different archived passages of HX 130709 during the attenuation. Results of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that eight distinct patterns with 22 to 30 DNA fragment bands were produced from field strains, and twelve distinct patterns with 23 to 27 DNA fragment bands were produced from different passages of the <b>attenuated</b> <b>strains.</b> Mouse pathogenicity test showed that the mortality of the mice infected with 104 CFU field strains was 100 % and the attenuation of strain HX 130709 occurred between 46 and 50 passages. All the field and <b>attenuated</b> <b>strains</b> were highly sensitive to β-lactam antibiotics, tetracyclines and macrolides. So, we can make conclusions that the acute swine erysipelas outbreaks in Eastern China were caused by serotype 1 a E. rhusiopathiae strains with different biochemical characteristics, and the virulence of serotype 1 a E. rhusiopathiae strains is unrelated with some point mutations in 432 -bp hypervariable region of the spaA gene...|$|R

The researchers suggested in cells that resist the normal inducement of apoptosis when infected will give NDV more time to incubate in cell and spread. Many cancer cells will overexpress antiapoptotic factors as part of tumor development.

40|$|Studies {{directed}} at vaccine development and mucosal immunity against Streptococcus pyogenes {{would benefit from}} the availability of live <b>attenuated</b> <b>strains.</b> Our approach for production of candidate live <b>attenuated</b> <b>strains</b> was to identify mutations that did not alter growth in vitro and did not alter the overall complement of virulence factors produced but did result in reduced levels of expression of multiple secreted virulence factors. A global reduction but not elimination of expression would likely lead to attenuation while maximizing the number of antigenic targets available for stimulation of immunity. Adaptation of Tn 5 -based transposome mutagenesis to S. pyogenes with initial screening for reduced expression of the SpeB protease resulted in identification of mutations in gidA, which encodes an enzyme involved in tRNA modification. Reduced SpeB expression was due to delayed onset of speB transcription resulting from reduced translation efficiency of the message for RopB, a transcriptional activator. Overall, GidA− mutants had a nearly normal global transcription profile but expressed significantly reduced levels of multiple virulence factors due to impaired translation efficiencies. A translation defect {{was supported by the}} observation that mutants lacking MnmE, which functions in the same tRNA modification pathway as GidA, phenocopied GidA deficiency. The mutants stimulated a cytokine response in cultured macrophages identical to that in the wild type, with the exception of reduced levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin- 23. Significantly, GidA− mutants were highly attenuated in the murine ulcer model of soft tissue infection. These characteristics suggest that GidA pathway tRNA modification mutants are attractive candidates for further evaluation as live <b>attenuated</b> <b>strains...</b>|$|R
