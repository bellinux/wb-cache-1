2500|$|In {{addition}} to having its broadcast heard on 660 AM in New York City, WFAN's programming is also transmitted via a secured internet feed to CBS owned and operated stations. These stations simulcast the same over-the <b>air</b> <b>feed</b> that is heard in New York City including all of the live team coverage including the New York Yankees, New York Giants, New Jersey Devils and the Brooklyn Nets. [...] The internet stream legally cannot include professional sports coverage because the Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the National Football League and the National Hockey League provide their own in-house on-demand and yearly subscription services for live and archived radio and television broadcasts.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{fault-tolerant}} MPC {{control of}} PEM fuel cells is addressed. MPC is a suitable control methodology to control fuel cell systems {{because of their}} multivariable and complex behaviour. Additionally, MPC {{is one of the}} control methodologies that can introduce more easily fault-tolerance. However, the problem of including actuator fault-tolerance in the control loops of these systems has not already been addressed in the literature. This work is focused on the <b>air</b> <b>feeding</b> control. A new control structure that not only uses the compressor voltage as a control variable but also the air valve opening area at the cathode output is considered to improve the fault-tolerance of the <b>air</b> <b>feeding</b> subsystem. It is shown that using this additional control permits to introduce fault-tolerance against compressor faults {{at the same time that}} allows to improve control performance. Finally, the proposed approach is assessed on a known test bench PEM fuel cell through simulation...|$|R

Therefore, a study was initiated to study all ESD valves in NH 3 plant, and to identify better ways of quantifying Reliability and improving Safety. In today’s world, industry leaders in petroleum refining, petrochemicals, power generation, and space ships typically design and install systems that are both safe and reliable by following safety and design standards.

50|$|Motorcycle engines {{may also}} use {{carburetor}} heating. In many cases, and especially with simple air-cooled engines, this relies solely upon an {{electric heating element}} attached to the carburetor, as a heat stove and attached warm <b>air</b> <b>feed</b> would be bulky, complex, difficult to route, and may even interfere with normal cooling of the cylinder block.

50|$|Although the {{operating}} pressure was maintained by an automatically controlled bleed valve once the plant had reached steady state, the valve {{could not be used}} during start-up, when there was no <b>air</b> <b>feed,</b> the plant being pressurised with nitrogen. During start-up the bleed valve was normally isolated and there was no route for excess pressure to escape; pressure was kept within acceptable limits (slightly wider that those achieved under automatic control) by operator intervention (manual operation of vent valves). A pressure-relief valve acting at 11 kg/cm2 (156 psi) gauge was also fitted.|$|E

An alternative method is a self-contained, oil-less air pump to feed pressurized air to the blast hood/helmet. An oil-less air pump does not require an air filter or carbon monoxide monitor/alarm, because the pressurized air is coming from a source that cannot generate carbon monoxide.|$|E

50|$|CBKST was {{licensed}} as a rebroadcaster of CBKRT, {{even though}} it operated as a semi-satellite with its own associated network of repeaters. While the CBC originally planned to discontinue CBKST's over the <b>air</b> <b>feed</b> on August 31, 2011 (as the corporation did not originally plan to convert rebroadcasters in mandatory transition markets like Saskatoon to digital), the CRTC granted the CBC permission to allow transmitters in selected mandatory markets, including Saskatoon, to still operate an analogue feed until August 31, 2012. On July 17, 2012, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved CBC's application to delete CBKST from CBKT's licence, effective August 1, 2012.

50|$|To start it, {{there was}} a flush {{submerged}} pull start handle in the top surface of the deck by the engine hatch. <b>Air</b> <b>feed</b> to the engine was controlled by a flapper valve vent forward on {{the nose of the}} board's top surface. It sucked air in, porting it to the stern (or rear) of the craft. It was constructed of a heavy marine grade aircraft aluminum alloy to withstand the saltwater conditions it would be used in. The hull was self-bailing via a venturi effect off the grated forward water feed port, {{on the bottom of the}} board, that exhausted through the jet drive nozzle to rear for propulsion. It required routine maintenance to keep a tiny vent hole clear of seaweed or debris or the engine compartment would flood easily.|$|E
