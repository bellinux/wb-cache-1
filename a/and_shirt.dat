5|$|Herbert Chapman won Arsenal's first {{national}} trophies, but died prematurely. He helped introduce the WM formation, floodlights, <b>and</b> <b>shirt</b> numbers, and added the white sleeves and brighter red to Arsenal's kit. Arsène Wenger {{has been the}} longest-serving manager and has won the most trophies. He has won a record 7 FA Cups, and his teams set English records for the longest win streak and longest unbeaten run.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, Darlington's kit {{consisted}} of a shirt with black and white vertical stripes, black shorts and black socks. Apart from a period between the 1910s and 1936, when blue shorts were worn, the basic colours of the home kit have remained black and white. The shirt design has varied, from the 1888 vertical stripes, through hoops, plain white, and back to hoops again in the 1990s. Sponsors' names have appeared on Darlington's shirts since the 1980s. A table of kit manufacturers (since the 1970s) <b>and</b> <b>shirt</b> sponsors appears on the right.|$|E
5|$|Transformed, Chapman's Arsenal claimed {{their first}} {{national}} trophy, the FA Cup, in 1930. Two League Championships followed, in 1930–31 and 1932–33. Chapman also presided over multiple off the pitch changes: white sleeves <b>and</b> <b>shirt</b> numbers {{were added to}} the kit; a Tube station was named after the club; and the first of two opulent, Art Deco stands was completed, with some of the first floodlights in English football. Suddenly, {{in the middle of the}} 1933–34 season, Chapman died of pneumonia. His work was left to Joe Shaw and George Allison, who saw out a hat-trick with the 1933–34 and 1934–35 titles, and then won the 1936 FA Cup and 1937–38 title.|$|E

25|$|A {{waistcoat}} {{is never}} worn {{with a double}} breasted jacket. Since this style of jacket is never unbuttoned, the waist of the trousers is never exposed, and therefore {{does not need to}} be covered, though before World War II an edge of waistcoat was often shown between the jacket <b>and</b> <b>shirt.</b>|$|E
25|$|While one cannot always {{identify}} the position/job of a soldier, two optional factors help make this identification: an aiguillette {{attached to the}} left shoulder strap <b>and</b> <b>shirt</b> pocket, and a pin indicating the soldier's work type (usually given by a professional course). Other pins may indicate the corps or additional courses taken. Finally, an optional battle pin indicates a war that a soldier has fought in.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the 1980s, {{question}} marks formed a constant motif, usually on the shirt collars or, {{in the case}} of the Seventh Doctor, on his sleeveless jumper and the handle to his umbrella. The idea was grounded in branding considerations, as was the movement starting in Tom Baker's final season toward an unchanging costume for each Doctor, rather than the variants on a theme employed over the first seventeen years of the programme. When the Eighth Doctor regenerated, he clad himself in a 19th-century frock coat <b>and</b> <b>shirt</b> based on a Wild Bill Hickok costume, reminiscent of the out-of-time quality of earlier Doctors and emphasising the Eighth Doctor's more Romantic persona.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, Emirates began flying {{non-stop}} to New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport {{using their}} new Airbus A340-500. These flights meant {{the resumption of}} non-stop air services between the United Arab Emirates and the United States, after Delta Air Lines withdrew its flights in 2001, and restarted again in 2007. In the same year, Emirates signed a £100million deal with English Premier League football team Arsenal, which includes naming rights to its new stadium for 15 years <b>and</b> <b>shirt</b> sponsorship for eight years, starting in the 2006/07 season.

Both consisted of a single-breasted Norfolk style coat with gilt buttons and a rating badge on the left sleeve, worn over a skirt of the same fabric <b>and</b> <b>shirt</b> waist. The coat had patch pockets on each hip and a belt. The skirt was hemmed to four inches above the ankle, and the shirt waist was designed to be worn either open at the neck or buttoned. Hats were to be flat-brimmed sailor hats of navy blue felt or straw. Shoes, hose, gloves and a standard Navy neckerchief completed the outfit. Capes were also {{prescribed for}} cold weather.|$|E

25|$|While {{in command}} of the Jane, Rodgers' strong and {{determined}} character was made evident during one of his voyages navigating the North Sea. Adverse winter winds had carried the vessel off course, the ship's provisions were almost exhausted, and three of his crewmen had frozen to death in one night, while most of the others had lapsed into hopeless despair. When Rodgers ordered some of the crew to go aloft to secure the ice encrusted rigging, they refused. Outraged at their desolation, Rodgers stripped off his jacket <b>and</b> <b>shirt</b> and, before going aloft, told the insubordinate crew to watch what a man could do. While he climbed the frozen rigging bare-chested, the crew, awe struck, immediately rose to his aid and in little time they secured the faltering rigging. Under the grim circumstances of their situation Rodgers put the matter behind him and days later they safely reached port.|$|E
25|$|After a {{short while}} he was dragged down and {{stripped}} of his nightgown <b>and</b> <b>shirt,</b> which was then wrapped around his head before he was hauled up again. However, the mob had not tied his hands and, as he struggled free, they broke his arm and shoulder, while another attempted to set light to his naked foot. He was taken down a further time and cruelly beaten before being hung up again, and died {{a short while}} later, just before midnight on 7 September 1736. The spot where Porteous died is today marked by a memorial plate in the Grassmarket. The site of the Tolbooth is marked by paving stones arranged {{in the form of}} a heart, 'The Heart of Midlothian'. Tour guides will assure you that, even today, passers-by will spit on the spot, a tradition originally intended to demonstrate their contempt for the hated Tolbooth.|$|E

25|$|In June 2010, {{during the}} {{build-up}} to the World Cup, Ronaldo became the fourth footballer– after Steven Gerrard, Pelé and David Beckham– {{to be represented}} as a waxwork at Madame Tussauds London. Another waxwork of him {{was presented at the}} Madrid Wax Museum in December 2013. In June 2015, astronomers led by David Sobral from Lisbon and Leiden discovered a galaxy which they named CR7 (Cosmos Redshift 7) in tribute to Cristiano Ronaldo in reference to his CR7 mantle (his initials <b>and</b> <b>shirt</b> number). On 23 July 2016, following Portugal's triumph at Euro 2016, Madeira Airport in Funchal was renamed the Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport. The unveiling of the rebranded terminal took place on 29 March 2017, which included a bust of his head being presented. Neither the bust nor the name change were unanimous, actually far form a consensus, as the former was ridicularized by Saturday Night Live's character Cecilia Giminez portrayed by comedian and actress Kate McKinnon, with the latter being subject to much debate and controversy locally by politicians and citizens who even started a petition against the move.|$|E
25|$|Until recently, most sheriff's {{officers}} wore {{a standardized}} uniform (black pants <b>and</b> <b>shirt</b> with dark gray straw Stetson {{hat in the}} summer and a black felt Stetson hat in the winter with a black Class A jacket for the dress uniform and a black leather jacket for the winter) and all patrol vehicles were marked in the same manner (white with red stripes, etc.). Several counties have moved away from these practices. Patrol cars in these counties have different vehicle markings, and deputy sheriffs wear different uniforms. Some examples are Ulster County, which has dark gray uniforms similar to the New York State Police; and Warren County, whose deputy sheriffs wear tan shirts with dark brown pants. Dutchess County Deputy Sheriffs wear tactical Class B uniforms consisting of black shirts and black pants and a Class A uniform with light blue shirts with darker blue pants. In Suffolk County, the sheriff vehicles are black and white (similar to the police/sheriff vehicle scheme used in California). In New York City, deputy sheriffs wear a uniform very similar to sworn NYPD personnel. Ontario County Sheriff's deputies wear the traditional uniform; black pants, black shirt with brass buttons, and a black stetson.|$|E
