5|$|Final Destination 3 was {{originally}} {{the last part}} of a trilogy and had been in development since the release of Final Destination 2. Jeffrey Reddick, creator of the franchise and one of the co-writers of the first two films, did not return for the third installment. According to director James Wong, unlike the second film, which was closely tied to the first, Final Destination 3 was envisioned as a stand-alone sequel featuring new characters from the beginning, stating:e really felt that the idea of Final Destination, or the fact that Death can visit you and you can cheat death, that that could happen to anyone. And so we wanted to divorce from the first film character wise. We didn't want to follow that same thread. Part of the difficulty in that is when a character understands what happened to them before; it's <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>different</b> way in which they react to what's happening now. We felt the franchise could exist with a new group of people, instead of following those older characters all the way through. We wanted to see if this could work.|$|E

Luke Williams and Jonathan Boyd (The Sheepherders) had entered the CWA {{in the fall of}} 1982 and soon came head to head with the Fabulous Ones. The Fabulous Ones / Sheepherder feud stands {{as one of the most}} memorable and bloody feuds. A feud that would rage on in several promotions between 1982 and 1987. The “pretty boy”, well polished Fabulous Ones and the ugly, brawling savage Sheepherders made for the perfect opponents and repeatedly drew big gates all over the country. The matches started out pretty evenly with the Fabulous Ones and the Sheepherders splitting the decisions but soon turned brutal and often without a definite winner. In December, 1982 the Sheepherders won the Southern Tag Team Championship from Lane and Keirn which only turned the intensity of the matches up a notch. Between late December and Mid February the two teams traded the belts back and forth 4 times with the Fabulous Ones ending up with possession of them in the end. On March 28 the Sheepherders wrestled their last match in the Mid-South Coliseum before leaving the CWA giving the Fabulous Ones (Kayfabe) credit for running them out of Memphis.|$|E

500|$|Concept artist Tully Summers {{commented on}} Nolan's style of {{cinematography}} {{when asked about}} the difference between his designs for this film and fantasy-based designs for Men in Black 3: [...] "The difference for me was Christopher Nolan's visual style. One {{of the things that makes}} his Batman movies so compelling is their tone of plausibility. He will often prefer a raw, grittier design over one that is very sleek and product design pretty. It's sort of a practical military aesthetic. This stuff is made to work, not impress shoppers. The Dark Knight Rises is a war film." [...] Producer Emma Thomas stated this Batman film has a different visual aesthetic from the first two Nolan-directed features, explaining that [...] "it's meant to be winter in Gotham, so that right there is going to lend <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>different</b> look to the film." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{was quickly}} {{followed}} by [...] "Third Day of a Seven Day Binge". Manson {{said that the}} recording of the album [...] "just became a rhythm.

[...] This is {{in stark contrast to}} the recording of The High End of Low (2009) and Born Villain, when he was frequently [...] "dragged into the studio" [...] late at night to record vocals. He credited this enthusiasm to the collaborative process between him and Bates, saying that he realized after the first performance of [...] "Birds of Hell Awaiting" [...] that [...] " [...] just sang it. I didn't even know where the music was going to go and I just went with it and it was very organic. And then it opened up <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>different</b> part of my mind." ...|$|E

In July 2015, she was revealed to be physically appearing in the second season, and Verbeek was cast in the role by October 2015. Verbeek was in Europe when she auditioned for and got the part, and Agent Carter had not yet begun airing there, so Verbeek [...] "didn't really know anything. I just talked to the showrunners, what is it about, what is the character about." [...] Verbeek wanted to play more than just [...] "the wife of", and noted that her take on the character is [...] "somewhat unexpected with Jarvis being who he is ...

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} {{and has been}} cited by many critics {{as one of the}} best in the series, with several commentators calling the twist ending shocking, unexpected and likely to change the direction of the entire series. Entertainment Weekly television writer Ken Tucker praised the twist of the episode, which he said [...] "sent the series spinning into a whole new direction for next season". Tucker praised the Dexter writing staff, [...] "for maintaining the suspense while creating a whole new world within the Dexter world: the awful universe of Trinity and his own trapped family." [...] Bill Harris of the Toronto Sun said the episode was good before the final scene, but that the twist shed <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>different</b> light on several scenes.

500|$|The {{distinction}} between [...] "legitimate" [...] Restoration drama and the Restoration spectacular, or [...] "musical spectacular," [...] or [...] "Dorset Garden spectacular," [...] or [...] "machine play" [...] {{is one of}} degree rather than kind. All plays of the period featured music and dancing and some scenery, most of them also songs. Restoration heroic drama, for all its literariness, relied on opulent scenery. However, the true spectacular, of which Milhous counts only eight over the entire 1660–1700 Restoration period, was produced on <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>different</b> scale. The spectacular {{is defined by the}} large number of sets and performers required, the vast sums of money invested, the potential for great profits, and the long preparation time needed. Milhous calculates a likely requirement of at least four to six months of planning, contracting, building, and rehearsing, to be compared with the four to six weeks of rehearsal time a new [...] "legitimate" [...] play would get.|$|E
500|$|Likewise, several reviewers {{expressed}} {{frustration with}} the lack of a full-body shot of Clark in the Superman suit, as well as the way in which Superman was presented as flying through the use of CGI.

Carabott called the CGI effects [...] "a little shoddy", but that they made up [...] "one of the most important moments of the series". Peterson and Souders, however, were reportedly [...] "thrilled" [...] by the [...] "great debate", noting that [...] "what [...] wanted to do all along was show hints at where he was going, because [...] is <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>different</b> story that is yet to be told." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{writing and}} {{formation}} of By the Way began {{immediately following the}} culmination of Californication's world tour, {{in the spring of}} 2001. As with Californication, much of the creation took place in the band members' homes and other practice locations, such as a recording studio stage. Kiedis recalled of the situation: [...] "We started finding some magic and some music and some riffs and some rhythms and some jams and some grooves, and we added to it and subtracted from it and pushed it around and put melodies to it." [...] Frusciante and Kiedis would collaborate for days straight, discussing guitar progressions and sharing lyrics. For Kiedis, [...] "writing By the Way...was <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>different</b> experience from Californication. John was back to himself and brimming with confidence." [...] Prior to recording By the Way, the Chili Peppers decided that they would again have Rick Rubin produce the album.

Tony Iommi is the king of the heavy riff."

It just opens up your mind to another dimension...Paranoid is the whole Sabbath experience; very indicative of what Sabbath meant at the time.

500|$|The post-hardcore {{sound of}} Box Car Racer {{inspired}} {{the change in}} tone and experimental nature the band approached Blink-182 with.

[...] Hoppus recalled that Barker entered the production process by urging the band to [...] " [...] as the next Blink-182 record — {{think of it as the}} first Blink-182 record." [...] The members were also inspired after hearing [...] by Bad Astronaut and its expansive sound. [...] "Once the door was opened by Tom and Travis with Box Car Racer, Mark started to be more on board with that concept. He was also more flexible and the next Blink album was able to be a pretty big departure from the previous two", said assistant engineer Sam Boukas. [...] "Box Car Racer opened the door in that sense and I think the three of them wanted to be more creative and have more creative liberty on that next album." ...|$|E

500|$|One of the {{consequences}} of all the uncertainty behind the scenes was Chrissie's final fate, which was left largely unresolved. Oberman revealed in July 2009 that originally there were plans for a trial, but that poor timing ultimately shelved the storyline. She recalled how the storyline [...] "was put on hold and then there was <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>different</b> team involved after that. I know that if they couldn't get me, Michelle and Kim together, [...] And I'd moved straight on to Doctor Who, too.

500|$|After publication, Juster sent {{a copy of}} {{the book}} to the Ford Foundation, with an {{explanation}} of how the projected book on cities had transformed into The Phantom Tollbooth. He never heard back from them, and learned years later that they were delighted by the turn of events. With the book having become an unexpected hit, Juster found himself answering letters from young readers, and a few parents. He found that children understood the wordplay at different ages, and heard from the occasional college student as well. Some students wrote a second time after a gap of years [...] "and they'll talk to me about <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>different</b> book, normally. But now they've got a lot more of the words right. A lot more of the fun kind of crazy references". He learned too that readers were capable of more than he had intended, {{as in the case of}} the letter sent by the Mathemagician to King Azaz. Composed entirely of numbers, some readers assumed it was a code and set about breaking it, only to appeal to Juster for help when they were not successful.

500|$|Moffat {{found it}} {{interesting}} that the Doctor regularly experienced time out of order and was used to <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>different</b> kind of causality. He believed that the Doctor would attempt to cheat and break his own rules to save the universe from collapsing. The time travel used in the episode {{is compatible with the}} theory of time travel. As the episode features many [...] "time-jumps" [...] when the Doctor travels back to do things seen in the opening credits, Moffat decided to make it less complicated by allowing the audience to figure things out before they occurred. He did this by calling attention to the future-Doctor in the opening scenes by having him wearing a fez and holding a mop, and as the viewers saw the Doctor later acquire these items they would begin to connect the events. Moffat mentioned the fez to fellow executive producers Piers Wenger and Beth Willis; they both were worried that Smith would become too attached to the hat and want to incorporate it into his costume, but Moffat assured him that he was planning on destroying the fez. Wenger later stated that Smith was [...] "one {{of the few people who}} can pull off a fez".|$|E
