5|$|Aside {{from its}} {{use as an}} Olympic stadium, the Olympiastadion has a strong footballing tradition, having been the home ground of Hertha BSC since 1963. It was also used for three matches at the 1974 FIFA World Cup, and was renovated ahead of the 2006 tournament, <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> hosted six matches, {{including}} the final.|$|E
5|$|Football was {{an amateur}} game until July 1885, when the Football Association decided to legalise {{payments}} to players. West Bromwich Albion held a committee meeting the following month, <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> {{was decided that}} the club should become professional. Albion's first professionals earned 10 shillings (50 pence) per week, with no training allowance provided.|$|E

5|$|After Stalin's death, Nikita Khrushchev became {{leader of}} the Soviet Union and began a process of de-Stalinisation, citing Lenin's writings, {{including}} those on Stalin, to legitimise this process. When Mikhail Gorbachev took power in 1985 and introduced the policies of glastnost and perestroika, he too cited these actions as a return to Lenin's principles. In late 1991, amid {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union, Russian President Boris Yeltsin ordered the Lenin archive be removed from Communist Party control and placed under the control of a state organ, the Russian Centre for the Preservation and Study of Documents of Recent History, <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> was revealed that over 6,000 of Lenin's writings had gone unpublished. These were declassified and made available for scholarly study. Yeltsin did not dismantle the Lenin mausoleum, recognising that Lenin was too popular and well respected among the Russian populace for this to be viable.|$|E
5|$|Another {{option is}} to {{classify}} selection by the life cycle stage <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> acts. Some biologists recognise just two types: viability (or survival) selection, which acts to increase an organism's probability of survival, and fecundity (or fertility or reproductive) selection, which acts to increase the rate of reproduction, given survival. Others split the life cycle into further components of selection. Thus viability and survival selection may be defined separately and respectively as acting to improve the probability of survival before and after reproductive age is reached, while fecundity selection may be split into additional sub-components including sexual selection, gametic selection, acting on gamete survival, and compatibility selection, acting on zygote formation.|$|E
5|$|Chinese Nü Yr is an electronica album using {{elements}} of bass, grime and 2-step garage. Malliagh explained that Chinese Nü Yr is based {{a story about}} 'Xiāngjiāo', a gelatinous and amorphous worm who wears a witch hat and is voiced by heavily pitch-shifted and processed recordings {{of his father and}} little sister. Xiāngjiāo is forced to go through portals in colorful and nonsensical lands, having to dodge things such as peanuts, floating fruit, pink-colored fog, and mountains growing out of the ground. Xiāngjiāo fears both the unfamiliarity of future lands and the extreme speed <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> travels. In a December 2015 interview, Malliagh stated the fate of the worm will occur in a full-length album.|$|E

5|$|Christensen and Ewan McGregor began rehearsing their climactic lightsaber duel {{long before}} Lucas would shoot it. They trained {{extensively}} with stunt coordinator Nick Gillard to memorize and perform their duel together. As {{in the previous}} two prequel films, McGregor and Christensen performed their own lightsaber fighting scenes {{without the use of}} stunt doubles. The speed at which Vader and Obi-Wan engage in their duel is mostly the speed <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> was filmed, although there are instances where single frames were removed to increase the velocity of particular strikes. An example of this occurs as Obi-Wan strikes down on Vader after applying an armlock in the duel's first half.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Adamson, {{promoter}} of the Manchester Ship Canal, {{lived at the}} Towers (blue plaque – once the Shirley Institute) on Wilmslow Road from 1874 {{until his death in}} 1890. His Grade II listed home, designed by Thomas Worthington for John Edward Taylor, the editor and proprietor of the Manchester Guardian, was the venue for the 1882 meeting <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> was decided to construct the ship canal project.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, local {{businessman}} Leonard P. Thompson {{threatened to}} lead a breakaway from the amateur club to create an entirely separate professional club, Ipswich United.

5|$|On 21November, {{a conference}} between GHQ, Kenney, Carpender and Barbey {{was held in}} Brisbane <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> was decided to land a small force in the Arawe area. This {{operation}} had three goals: to divert Japanese attention from Cape Gloucester, to provide a base for PT boats, and to establish a defensive perimeter and {{make contact with the}} Marines once they landed. It was intended that PT boats operating from Arawe would disrupt Japanese barge traffic along the southern shore of New Britain and protect the Allied naval forces at Cape Gloucester from attack.|$|E
5|$|Reid was {{nominated}} as the UFA candidate in Vermilion during the 1921 provincial election, {{the first in}} which the UFA ran candidates. The Legislative Assembly of Alberta was dominated by the Liberals, who had governed Alberta since its creation in 1905. To Reid's great surprise, he defeated his Liberal opponent and {{was elected to the}} legislature, along with 37 of his fellow UFA candidates—enough to form a majority government. He chaired the first meeting of the new UFA caucus, <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> selected Herbert Greenfield as Premier. Reid was re-elected in the 1926 and 1930 elections.|$|E

5|$|Relatively common, the Portuguese dogfish is {{an active}} hunter capable of {{tackling}} fast, large prey. It feeds mainly on cephalopods and fishes, though it also consumes invertebrates and cetacean carrion. This shark has acute vision optimized for detecting the bioluminescence of its prey, as sunlight does not reach the depths <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> lives. The Portuguese dogfish is aplacental viviparous, with the young provisioned by yolk and perhaps uterine fluid. The females give birth to up to 29 young after a gestation period of over one year. Valued for its liver oil {{and to a lesser}} extent meat, Portuguese dogfish are important to deepwater commercial fisheries operating off Portugal, the British Isles, Japan, and Australia. These fishing pressures and the low reproductive rate of this species have led the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to assess it as Near Threatened.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Britain proved for {{the first}} time that the Junkers Ju 87 was {{vulnerable}} in hostile skies against well-organised and determined fighter opposition. The Ju 87, like other dive bombers, was slow and possessed inadequate defences. Furthermore, it could not be effectively protected by fighters because of its low speed, and the very low altitudes <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> ended its dive bomb attacks. The Stuka depended on air superiority, the very thing being contested over Britain. It was withdrawn from attacks on Britain in August after prohibitive losses, leaving the Luftwaffe without precision ground-attack aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Gediminid dynasty {{began its}} ascent in Lithuania {{during this time}} with the {{emergence}} of its first leader, Butigeidis. In 1289, leading about 8,000 troops, he attacked Sambia. In 1289 the Teutonic Knights built a castle in present-day Sovetsk (Tilsit) and their raids intensified. Butigeidis was the first to build strong castles along the Neman River. He died in 1290 or 1292, and his brother Butvydas (also known as Pukuveras) inherited the crown. Butvydas was the father of Vytenis and probably of Gediminas. During his short reign Butvydas tried to defend the duchy against the Teutonic Knights; he also attacked Masovia, an ally of the knights. His son, Vytenis, advanced to power in 1295 and ended the period of relative instability. His reign marks the transition from the state's establishment to the point <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> was poised for expansion.|$|E

5|$|The Sun {{is roughly}} middle-aged; {{it has not}} changed {{dramatically}} {{for more than four}} billion years, and will remain fairly stable for more than another five billion years. After hydrogen fusion in its core has diminished to the point <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, the core of the Sun will experience a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand to eventually become a red giant. It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of Mercury and Venus, and render Earth uninhabitable.|$|E
5|$|The Thunderjet had a {{distinguished}} record during the Korean War. Although the F-84B and F-84C {{could not be}} deployed because their J35 engines had a service life of only 40 hours, the F-84D and F-84E entered combat with 27th Fighter Escort Group on 7 December 1950. The aircraft were initially tasked with escorting the B-29 Superfortress bombers. The first Thunderjet air-to-air victory was scored on 21 January 1951 {{at the cost of}} two F-84s. The F-84 was a generation behind the swept-wing Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 and outmatched, especially when the MiGs were flown by more-experienced pilots, and the MiG counter-air mission was soon given to the F-86 Sabre. Like its famous predecessor, the P-47, the F-84 switched to the low-level interdiction role <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> excelled.|$|E
5|$|The {{common loon}} {{produces}} {{a variety of}} vocalizations, {{the most common of}} which are the tremolo, the yodel, the wail, and the hoot. Each of these calls communicates a distinct message. The frequency <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> vocalizes has been shown to vary based on time of day, weather, and season. It is most vocally active between mid-May and mid-June. The wail, yodel, and tremolo calls are sounded more frequently at night than during the day; calls have also been shown to occur more frequently in cold temperatures and when there is little to no rain.|$|E
