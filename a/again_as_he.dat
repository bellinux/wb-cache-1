Archduke Ferdinand and a dozen cavalry squadrons broke out through the French army and escaped into Bohemia. <b>Again,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had been at Mantua, Klenau {{was caught in a}} siege from which there was no escape, and again, he helped to negotiate the terms, when, on 21 October, Karl Mack surrendered the encircled army of 20,000 infantry and 3,273 cavalry.

Once <b>again,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> ran on foot toward German lines, Stahlschmidt was fired on by an Allied truck convoy which he had just overflown. However he {{was picked up by}} a German {{reconnaissance}} unit. Back at Staffel HQ Stahlschmidt learned from Marseille and Homuth that the lead Kittyhawk had pulled up sharply and fired accurately.
