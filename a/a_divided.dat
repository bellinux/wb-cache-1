5|$|Expansion of US113 to <b>a</b> <b>divided</b> highway {{began in}} the 1950s in Dover. Much of the {{remainder}} of the U.S. Highway in Delaware was expanded in the 1960s; the final section of two-lane US113 in that state was expanded in the mid-1990s. The Berlin bypass became the first section of US113 in Maryland to be expanded to <b>a</b> <b>divided</b> highway in the mid-1950s. In the early 1970s, US113 between Pocomoke City and Snow Hill was expanded to <b>a</b> <b>divided</b> highway and the Snow Hill bypass was constructed, replacing what would become US113Business. The U.S. Highway between Berlin and the Delaware state line was expanded to <b>a</b> <b>divided</b> highway around 2000. The Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA) is upgrading the last remaining two-lane portions of US113 between Snow Hill and Berlin to a four-lane divided highway. US113's northern terminus was moved to Milford in 2004 after the U.S. Highway was superseded by DE1 from Milford to Dover. The Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) plans to upgrade US113 to a freeway from Selbyville to Ellendale; a freeway bypass of Milford was cancelled in 2008 because of community opposition.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, MD 5 was rerouted {{to follow}} Branch Avenue to the Washington, D.C. border, {{replacing}} MD 637; MD 637 was designated onto Naylor Road between MD 5 and the Washington, D.C. border by 1966. In addition, the route was widened into <b>a</b> <b>divided</b> highway along the US 301 concurrency between the Charles-Prince George's county border and TB and along Branch Avenue between {{south of the}} Henson Creek and the Washington, D.C. border. MD 5 was upgraded from a bituminous to a paved road between St. Mary's City and Great Mills in 1953. The same year, the portion of route along the US 301 concurrency between Waldorf and the Charles-Prince George's county border was widened into <b>a</b> <b>divided</b> highway. MD 5 was relocated to a new alignment to the east between TB and north of Camp Springs in 1956, with a northward extension of MD 381 designated onto the former alignment. This section of MD 381, called Brandywine Road and Old Branch Avenue, was transferred to county maintenance in 1965. In 1959, MD 5 was paved between south of St. Inigoes and St. Mary's City. A year later, {{the remainder of the}} route south to Point Lookout was paved. In 1962, MD 5 was widened into <b>a</b> <b>divided</b> highway between south of Newmarket and the St. Mary's-Charles county border and between MD 223 in Clinton and Camp Springs. An interchange was built at the northern terminus of the US 301 concurrency in 1963. The route was upgraded to <b>a</b> <b>divided</b> highway in the Beantown area in 1964. In 1965, MD 5 was improved to <b>a</b> <b>divided</b> highway between MD 235 and south of Newmarket. The divided highway was extended south from Beantown to the MD 488 intersection in 1966. In 1967, the route was widened into <b>a</b> <b>divided</b> highway between the St. Mary's-Charles county border and MD 488 {{with the exception of the}} portion through Hughesville. MD 5 was upgraded to <b>a</b> <b>divided</b> highway between US 301 and MD 223 in 1969. An interchange was constructed at MD 414 in 1970.|$|E

The route remains <b>a</b> <b>divided</b> highway until it reaches Sedona, an arts and resort community known for its red sandstone formations. As it enters the city of Sedona, the route {{is known as the}} Si Birch Memorial Highway. The route continues east through Sedona, providing access to the Sedona Airport. SR 89A continues towards the east through Sedona to an intersection with SR 179, which heads south from this intersection through the southern part of Sedona to provide access to I-17.|$|E
5|$|At Bristol Road, PA 263 enters Warwick Township {{and becomes}} a four-lane divided highway as it turns north and runs through wooded areas with some homes, {{crossing}} Little Neshaminy Creek. The route regains a center left-turn lane as it reaches an intersection with Almshouse Road {{in the community of}} Jamison. At this intersection, the route is briefly <b>a</b> <b>divided</b> highway. After Almshouse Road, PA 263 continues north through business areas before heading past residential development. The route turns back into <b>a</b> <b>divided</b> highway as it crosses over the Neshaminy Creek and passes through areas woodland and homes. The road leaves Warwick Township for Buckingham Township at the Sugar Bottom Road intersection.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, {{the entire}} length of US 13 between Dover and Wilmington was widened into <b>a</b> <b>divided</b> highway, which at the time was the best {{superhighway}} and the longest stretch of divided highway in the world. During the course of the 1930s, several other state roads were constructed while others were widened into divided highways. In 1935, the DSHD took over maintenance of all remaining county roads, tripling the mileage of the state highway system, and took over several city streets in Wilmington in 1936. Progress on improving the state highway system slowed during World War II; the only major project completed during that time was the construction of the high-level St. Georges Bridge to replace a lift bridge destroyed by a ship in 1939. Following the war, several highway improvement projects took place including widening more roads to divided highways. On August 16, 1951, the Delaware Memorial Bridge and its approach road opened to traffic, providing a fixed road link for US 40 across the Delaware River to New Jersey and replacing ferry service that previously existed. Following the completion of the bridge, traffic along US 13 and US 40 increased, with plans made for a new freeway to handle the increased traffic. In 1957, US 13 was widened into <b>a</b> <b>divided</b> highway between Greenwood and Harrington, providing <b>a</b> <b>divided</b> highway running the north-south length of the state.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, DSHD {{initiated}} traffic {{surveys and}} studies to inform plans {{to construct a}} four-lane divided highway south from Dover. The studies, completed in 1942, found that US13 from Delmar to Dover carried significantly more traffic than US113 from Selbyville to Dover, so DSHD started planning for the divided highway to the Maryland state line to be along the US13 corridor. However, DSHD also approved plans for expansion of US113 to <b>a</b> <b>divided</b> highway from Milford to Little Heaven. DSHD completed the final link in the DoverDelmar divided highway in 1957. As in Delaware, Maryland SRC prioritized completing expansion of US13 to a four-lane highway from Virginia to Delaware, which was completed in 1966. By that time, {{only a small portion}} of US 113 around Berlin had been expanded to <b>a</b> <b>divided</b> highway.|$|E

5|$|MD 704 was {{expanded}} to <b>a</b> <b>divided</b> highway from the District of Columbia boundary to Addison Road in Seat Pleasant in 1962. The segment of divided highway at the US 50 interchange was extended west to Ardwick Ardmore Road in Glenarden in 1969. MD 704's modern cloverleaf interchange with MD 202 {{was completed in}} 1971, the same year the former highway {{was expanded}} to <b>a</b> <b>divided</b> highway from Seat Pleasant to {{just north of the}} latter highway. The divided highway was extended southwest through Glenarden from Ardwick Ardmore Road to Glenarden Parkway in 1972 and to MD 202 in 1973. MD 704 was renamed for Martin Luther King, Jr., in 1987. The highway's interchange with US 50 was rebuilt in 1991 in conjunction with the overhaul of the US 50Capital Beltway interchange immediately to the west; two of the interchange's loop ramps with westbound MD 704 were removed. The MD 704 divided highway was extended east from the US 50 interchange to Forbes Boulevard in 1997 and Lottsford Vista Road in 1999. MD 704 and MD 450 were relocated at their junction to make MD 704 part of the eastwest axis of a more orthogonal intersection in 2000. This project was part of the expansion of the final segment of MD 704 and the adjacent portion of MD 450 to <b>a</b> <b>divided</b> highway.|$|E

5|$|MDSHA {{conducted}} {{its first}} study on expanding US113 north of Berlin to <b>a</b> <b>divided</b> highway {{in the early}} 1970s. Although US113 was not expanded at that time, preparations for a future expansion were started, including acquisition of right of way along the proposed route. When MD 90 was built from US 50 to east of US 113 between 1973 and 1976, its interchange with the future course of US 113 was partially constructed. MDSHA conducted a second planning study in the late 1980s; in 1990, the agency decided to implement intersection improvements instead of constructing <b>a</b> <b>divided</b> highway. One particular improvement was reconstructing the highway immediately {{to the south of}} the Delaware state line to better tie into the divided highway in Delaware in 1989 and 1990.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Route 182 intersection, the route crosses the Musconetcong River into Washington Township, Morris County, where it heads back into rural surroundings. About a mile into Morris County, US 46 divides {{and becomes a}} four-lane highway, turning north and {{crossing}} over a mountain. It continues into Mount Olive Township, taking a sharp turn to the east before the road becomes undivided while remaining four lanes. The road passes rural areas and development as it goes through Budd Lake. In this community, the route passes {{to the south of}} the namesake lake as it begins to turn northeast and then north. The road heads northeast again before it enters Netcong and becomes <b>a</b> <b>divided</b> highway as it comes to an interchange with I-80/US 206. Within this interchange, the lanes of US 46 split. From this point, the route narrows back into a two-lane undivided road and runs through developed areas of Netcong a short distance to the south of New Jersey Transit’s Morristown Line/Montclair-Boonton Line. US 46 meets Route 183 at an intersection (formerly Netcong Circle) before widening into a four-lane undivided road and leaving Netcong for Roxbury Township. Here, the road passes through wooded areas, meeting I-80 at another interchange and briefly becoming <b>a</b> <b>divided</b> highway at the crossing under I-80 and again at the actual interchange. US 46 remains <b>a</b> <b>divided</b> highway with jughandles past this point, continuing southeast into the Ledgewood area.|$|E

5|$|The first {{divided highway}} project on US113 proper began in 1957. The U.S. Highway's second {{carriageway}} was completed from its junction with US13 and South Little Creek Road {{to the southern}} end of Dover Air Force Base in 1959. The first segment of the original DuPont Highway south of Dover to be expanded to <b>a</b> <b>divided</b> highway was from Walnut Street {{at the north end of}} Milford to south of Frederica; the southbound roadway of the divided highway section was constructed between 1957 and 1959. The US 113 divided highway was extended around Milford when the southbound carriageway was built from Walnut Street south to near Lincoln between 1961 and 1963; the project included a pair of bridges over the east end of Haven Lake at the KentSussex county line. The Frederica bypass was constructed as a four-lane divided highway between 1963 and 1965. US 113 was expanded to <b>a</b> <b>divided</b> highway from just north of the Maryland state line in Selbyville to DE 20 north of Dagsboro between 1965 and 1967. The highway's second carriageway was built from north of Dagsboro to Stockley between 1966 and 1968. US 113 was completed as <b>a</b> <b>divided</b> highway from Stockley to Bedford Street on the northern edge of Georgetown in 1969.
