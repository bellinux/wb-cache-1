40|$|Abstract: In {{the present}} study, we aimed to preincubate MCF- 10 <b>A</b> <b>cells</b> with {{pioglitazone}} and/or serum-rich growth media {{and to determine}} adhesive and non-adhesive interactions of the preincubated MCF- 10 <b>A</b> <b>cells</b> with BT- 474 cells. For this purpose, the MCF- 10 <b>A</b> <b>cells</b> were preincubated with pioglitazone and/or serum-rich growth media, at appropriate concentrations, for 1 week. The MCF- 10 <b>A</b> <b>cells</b> preincubated with pioglitazone and/or serum-rich growth media were then co-cultured adhesively and non-adhesively with BT- 474 cells for another week. Co-culture of BT- 474 cells with the preincubated MCF- 10 <b>A</b> <b>cells,</b> both adhesively and non-adhesively, reduced {{the growth of the}} cancer cells. The inhibitory effect of the preincubated MCF- 10 <b>A</b> <b>cells</b> against the growth of BT- 474 cells was likely produced by increasing levels of soluble factors secreted by the preincubated MCF- 10 <b>A</b> <b>cells</b> into the conditioned medium, as immunoassayed by ELISA.

40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that ScN 2 <b>a</b> <b>cells</b> (scrapie-infected neuroblastoma N 2 <b>a</b> <b>cells)</b> express 2 -fold- and 4 -fold-increased levels of IR (insulin receptor) and IGF- 1 R (insulin-like growth factor- 1 receptor) respectively. In addition, the IR alpha- and beta-subunits are aberrantly processed, with apparent molecular masses of 128 and 85 kDa respectively, {{as compared with}} 136 and 95 kDa in uninfected N 2 <b>a</b> <b>cells.</b> Despite the 2 -fold increase in IR protein, the number of (125) I-insulin-binding sites was slightly decreased in ScN 2 <b>a</b> <b>cells</b> [Ostlund, Lindegren, Pettersson and Bedecs (2001) Brain Res. 97, 161 - 170]. In {{order to determine the}} cellular localization of IR in ScN 2 <b>a</b> <b>cells,</b> surface biotinylation was performed, showing a correct IR trafficking and localization to the cell surface. The present study shows {{for the first time that}} neuroblastoma N 2 <b>a</b> <b>cells</b> express significant levels of IR-IGF- 1 R hybrid receptors, and in ScN 2 <b>a</b> <b>cells</b> the number of hybrid receptors was 2 -fold higher than that found in N 2 <b>a</b> <b>cells,</b> potentially explaining the apparent loss of insulin-binding sites due to a lower affinity for insulin compared with the homotypic IR. Furthermore, the decreased molecular mass of IR subunits in ScN 2 <b>a</b> <b>cells</b> is not caused by altered phosphorylation or proteolytic processing, but rather by altered glycosylation. Enzymic deglycosylation of immunoprecipitated IR from N 2 a and ScN 2 <b>a</b> <b>cells</b> with endoglycosidase H, peptide N-glycosidase F and neuraminidase all resulted in subunits with increased electrophoretic mobility; however, the 8 - 10 kDa shift remained. Combined enzymic or chemical deglycosylation using anhydrous trifluoromethane sulphonic acid treatment ultimately showed that the IR alpha- and beta-subunits from ScN 2 <b>a</b> <b>cells</b> are aberrantly glycosylated. The increased formation of IR-IGF- 1 R hybrids in ScN 2 <b>a</b> <b>cells</b> may be part of a neuroprotective response to prion infection. The degree and functional significance of aberrantly glycosylated proteins in ScN 2 <b>a</b> <b>cells</b> remain to be determined...|$|R

40|$|Helicobacter pylori {{infection}} {{is associated with}} several autoimmune diseases, in which autoantibody-producing B cells must be activated. Among these B cells, CD 5 -positive B- 1 <b>a</b> <b>cells</b> from BALB/c mice were confirmed to secrete autoantibodies when cocultured with purified H. pylori urease {{in the absence of}} T cells. To determine the mechanisms for autoantibody production, CD 5 -positive B- 1 <b>a</b> <b>cells</b> were sorted from murine spleen cells and stimulated with either purified H. pylori urease or H. pylori coated onto plates (referred to hereafter as plate-coated H. pylori), and autoantibody production was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

Urease-positive plated-coated H. pylori stimulated B- 1 <b>a</b> <b>cells</b> to produce autoantibodies, although urease-deficient isotype-matched H. pylori did not. Autoantibody secretion by B- 1 <b>a</b> <b>cells</b> was inhibited when bacteria were pretreated with anti-H. pylori urease-specific antibody having neutralizing ability against urease enzymatic activity but not with anti-H. pylori urease-specific antibody without neutralizing capacity. The B- 1 <b>a</b> <b>cells</b> externally express various Toll-like receptors (TLRs) : TLR 1, TLR 2, TLR 4, and TLR 6.
