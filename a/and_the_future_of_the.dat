5|$|Another {{mission to}} Titan {{proposed}} in early 2012 by Jason Barnes, {{a scientist at}} the University of Idaho, is the Aerial Vehicle for In-situ and Airborne Titan Reconnaissance (AVIATR): an unmanned plane (or drone) that would fly through Titan's atmosphere and take high-definition images of the surface of Titan. NASA did not approve the requested $715 million, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Legislative {{sessions}} held in Ottawa {{were conducted}} in an office building on Sparks Street. The Northwest Territories government continues to hold an office in Ottawa on Sparks Street to this day. In 1965, a federal government commission {{was set up to}} determine a new home for the government <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> territory. The seat of government was moved back inside the territories to Yellowknife, after it was selected capital in 1967.|$|E
5|$|There {{was little}} {{significant}} parliamentary representation for the burgher class, and none for the peasants. The Jewish communities sent representatives {{to their own}} Va'ad, or Council of Four Lands. The narrow social base of the Commonwealth's parliamentary system was detrimental to its future development <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Polish–Lithuanian statehood.|$|E

5|$|By 1896, the {{government}} planned to pass policing responsibilities to the provincial authorities and ultimately close the force. With {{the discovery of}} gold in the Klondike, however, the force was redeployed to protect Canada's sovereignty over the region and to manage the influx of prospectors. The mounted police sent volunteers {{to fight in the}} Second Boer War, and in recognition were retitled the Royal North-West Mounted Police in 1904. The plans for closure were abandoned in the face of opposition from regional politicians. Large numbers of the police volunteered for military service during the First World War, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> badly depleted force was once again in doubt. Towards the end of the war, however, fears grew about a potential Bolshevik conspiracy and the authorities tasked the mounted police to investigate the threat. In the aftermath of the violence of the Winnipeg General Strike, {{the government}} decided to amalgamate the force with the Dominion Police, to form the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in 1920.|$|E
5|$|Henry and his {{new wife}} did not {{conceive}} any children, generating prurient speculation as to the possible explanation, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dynasty appeared at risk. Henry may have begun to look among his nephews for a possible heir. He may have considered Stephen of Blois as a possible option and, perhaps in preparation for this, he arranged a beneficial marriage for Stephen to a wealthy heiress, Matilda. Theobald of Blois, his close ally, may have also {{felt that he was}} in favour with Henry. William Clito, who was King Louis's preferred choice, remained opposed to Henry and was therefore unsuitable. Henry may have also considered his own illegitimate son, Robert of Gloucester, as a possible candidate, but English tradition and custom would have looked unfavourably on this.|$|E
5|$|In 1983 and 1987, Davis made {{unsuccessful}} {{requests for}} all of the chapter house stones. After the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the de Young museum was to be rebuilt, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stones was reconsidered. In September 1993, museum director Harry Parker joined with Davis to sign an unconditional permanent loan of the chapter house stones to New Clairvaux. In 1994, the city approved the loan with the stipulation that the building be restored accurately and that it be occasionally open to the public. The stones were transported in 20 truckloads to Vina. Inside an old brick barn built by Stanford to make brandy, the stones began to be fitted together, laid flat on Burke's plywood templates.|$|E

5|$|In December 1941, Japan launched, {{in quick}} succession, attacks on British Malaya, the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, and Hong Kong. Churchill's {{reaction}} to the entry of the United States into the war was that Britain was now assured of victory <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> empire was safe, but {{the manner in which}} British forces were rapidly defeated in the Far East irreversibly harmed Britain's standing and prestige as an imperial power. Most damaging of all was the Fall of Singapore, which had previously been hailed as an impregnable fortress and the eastern equivalent of Gibraltar. The realisation that Britain could not defend its entire empire pushed Australia and New Zealand, which now appeared threatened by Japanese forces, into closer ties with the United States. This resulted in the 1951 ANZUS Pact between Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America.|$|E
5|$|The Corsica and Elba mines {{remained}} the chief {{source of employment}} until 1926, when the underground Elba mine closed. It had been mined out. A few years later, the Corsica mine was converted into an open pit, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town once again seemed secure. Then the Great Depression hit. In the fall of 1929, Corsica closed and stayed closed for many years, {{with only a few}} salaried people retained. The mine remained idle until 1940, ironically receiving an honorable mention in the National Safety Competition from the U.S. Bureau of Mines in 1934. Once World War II began, the mining business boomed again.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Henry put {{his hopes}} in fathering another son. William and Matilda's mother - Matilda of Scotland - {{had died in}} 1118, and so Henry took a new wife, Adeliza of Louvain. Henry and Adeliza did not {{conceive}} any children, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dynasty appeared at risk. Henry may have begun to look among his nephews for a possible heir. He may have considered his sister Adela's son Stephen of Blois as a possible option and, perhaps in preparation for this, he arranged a beneficial marriage for Stephen to Matilda's wealthy maternal cousin and namesake the Countess of Boulogne. Theobald of Blois, his close ally, possibly also {{felt that he was}} in favour with Henry. William Clito, the only son of Robert Curthose, was King Louis VI of France's preferred choice, but William was in open rebellion against Henry and was therefore unsuitable. Henry might have also considered his own illegitimate son, Robert of Gloucester, as a possible candidate, but English tradition and custom would have looked unfavourably on this. Henry's plans shifted when Empress Matilda's husband, Emperor Henry, died in 1125.|$|E
