500|$|Another {{controversy}} surrounding {{the dress was}} the question of its originality. Brooks Barnes of The New York Times wrote that the dress was [...] "derived" [...] from Incarnation, {{a painting of a}} white-haired girl wearing a meat dress by artist Mark Ryden. Sharon Clott of MTV also noted the similarity between Gaga's dress and Ryden's painting. Ryden was reportedly upset that Gaga did not acknowledge that she took inspiration from his work. Some in the art and fashion press remarked on the dress' similarity to , a meat dress made by Canadian sculptor Jana Sterbak in 1987 exhibited to considerable controversy at the National Gallery of Canada in 1991. Karen Rosenberg from The New York Times compared the dress to a series of photographs of Francis Bacon posing with sides of beef attached to his torso like wings in 1952, while The Daily Telegraph compared the dress to the original cover of The Beatles' 1966 album Yesterday and Today, and noted its similarity to the cover of the November 1983 The Undertones album <b>All</b> <b>Wrapped</b> <b>Up,</b> which showed a female model wearing a dress and gloves made of cuts of meat (mostly bacon) held in place with plastic wrap and a sausage necklace. Architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro had also designed a meat dress in 2006.

In addition, Handlen praised David Duchovny's performance, stating that he [...] "was on fire the whole episode". Tom Kessenich praised {{the second part of the}} episode and wrote [...] "'Redux II' is the standout hour of the two without question. With Scully on her deathbed, Mulder meets his sister only to lose her again and is put in a position where he may deal with the devil. The finale moments [...] are quite simply perfect and as good as any the show ever produced." [...] Shearman and Pearson rated the episode two-and-a-half stars out of five. The two noted [...] " [...] is a likable enough little romp, but it's too leisurely to be exciting, too predictable to be revealing, and–most crucially, not really funny enough to be comedy. Vitaris gave the second part of the episode a slightly less negative review than the first, but only awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. She criticized the ending, noting that [...] "it's <b>all</b> <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> neatly yet ambiguously."
