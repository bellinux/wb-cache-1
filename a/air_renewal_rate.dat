40|$|In this study, {{the water}} vapour balance method {{was used to}} {{evaluate}} the ventilation rate to calibrate and validate the ventilation sub-model of the Gembloux Dynamic Greenhouse Climate Model (GDGCM) in a naturally ventilated three span Azrom type greenhouse in Zimbabwe. Two ventilation strategies were considered to investigate their effects on the microclimate and transpiration of the rose crop: the configuration with roof vents only (while the side vents were closed) and the configuration with both roof vents and side vents. Crop transpiration was evaluated using the Penman-Monteith method. This allowed continuous and automatic determination of the ventilation rate and leakage rate using the water vapour balance method. The model was fitted to experimental data for ventilation rates, and the parameters for the model, the discharge and wind effect coefficient were determined using statistical analysis. The results showed that there was a good fit between measured and predicted values (R 2 = 0. 702 and 0. 729 for the model of ventilation for the greenhouse operating respectively with both roof and side vents and with roof vents only for the summer period considered), although there was a general overestimation of the air renewal rates, particularly during the night. The <b>air</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>rate</b> was found to be influenced by the ventilation regime in practice. The greenhouse was found to have higher air renewal rates for the configuration with both roof and side vents. On a typical hot day, the maximum simulated <b>air</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>rate</b> was 15. 6 hr- 1 for the configuration with roof and side vents at 1600 hrs, while it was only 6. 5 hr- 1 for the configuration with roof vents at the same time. The difference between the air renewal rates for the different regimes resulted in different microclimates, since the ventilation affects both the energy balance and mass balance of a greenhouse. The greenhouse inside air temperature was reduced significantly for the configuration with both roof and side vents as it had lower simulated air temperatures than the configuration with roof vents only. On a typical hot day the maximum simulated air temperature for the configuration with roof and side vents was 29. 7 ÂºC, while it was 31. 5 ÂºC for roof vents configuration at 1400 hrs. On typical selected days the maximum differences between the inside air temperature and the external air temperature were 3. 7 ÂºC and 4. 6 ÂºC for the configuration with both roof and side vents and the configuration with roof vents only, respectively. Thus during summer periods it is necessary to have a greenhouse with both roof and side vents so that plants will have a better physiological and morphological development, as the air renewal rates influence crop behaviour largely through their effects on gas exchanges, particularly transpiration and photosynthesis. The transpiration of the rose crop was found to be influenced by the ventilation strategy. The simulated maximum canopy transpiration flux density was 166. 5 W m- 2 for the configuration with both roof and side vents, while it was 152. 9 Wm- 2 for the roof vents only on a selected hot day. The simulated night-time relative humidities were higher for the configuration with roof vents only. The simulated relative humidity was above 90 % for the configuration with roof vents only, while it was 84 % for the configuration with both roof and side vents. To prevent excessive humidity build up, the ventilation strategy with both roof and side vents needs to be employed in order to prevent condensation in the greenhouse...|$|E
40|$|The flow {{characteristics}} and heat transfer are studied in a vertical annulus of a heated cylinder {{surrounded by a}} permeable cylinder, subject to cross uniform wind with open end {{to the environment and}} in the presence of natural convection. The objective here is to develop a computationally efficient model capable of capturing the physics of the flow and heat transport to predict air renewal rates in the vertical annulus. The small quantities of air infiltrating/exfiltrating through the porous cylinder over its upstream/downstream regions do not substantially affect the external flow pattern around the clothed cylinder. The air annulus flow and heat transport model predicted the radial and vertical mass fluxes and the mass flow rate at the opening as a function of environment conditions, porous cylinder thermal properties, wind speed, and annulus geometry. Experiments were performed in a low speed wind tunnel (0. 5 - 5 m/s), in which an isothermally heated vertical cylinder surrounded by a clothed outer cylinder was placed in uniform cross wind. The tracer gas method is used to predict total ventilation flow rates through the fabric and the opening. Good agreement was found between the model and experimental measurements of <b>air</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>rate</b> and predicted heat loss from the inner cylinder at steady conditions. A parametric study is performed to study the effect of wind speed and temperature difference between the wind and skin temperature on induced ventilation through the clothing and the opening. It is found that natural convection enhances ventilation of the annulus air at wind speed, less than 3 m/s, while at higher speeds, natural convection effect is negligible. As the temperature difference between external wind and inner cylinder surface increases, the vertical air temperature gradient and total upward airflow through the opening increase...|$|E
40|$|A simple {{greenhouse}} ventilation model, {{based on}} the stack and wind effects (the main driving forces for natural ventilation) was adapted, calibrated and validated using measured <b>air</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>rates</b> in a three span naturally ventilated Azrom type greenhouse in Zimbabwe. Crop transpiration rates were monitored using stem heat balance sap flow gauges installed on the main stems of rose plants to continuously monitor whole-plant transpiration (WPT). This allowed continuous and automatic determination of full scale <b>air</b> <b>renewal</b> and leakage <b>rates</b> using the water vapour balance method. The model was fitted to experimental data of ventilation rates, and discharge and wind effect coefficients were determined.

40|$|In {{the recent}} past, {{residential}} buildings in temperate climates were ventilated by the daily opening of windows and by exaggerated window and door permeability. Energy conservation concerns {{have led to}} better quality windows and lower air permeability that consequently increased the risk of condensation whilst decreasing indoor air quality. Because {{of the variation in}} natural factors, such as wind speed and the stack effect, natural ventilation systems are unlikely to permanently provide ideal ventilation rates. As such, we will characterize the performance of hybrid ventilation systems (air intake through automatically regulated louvers in bedrooms and living rooms, natural exhaust in bathrooms and fan exhaust systems in kitchens) that are a possible solution to this drawback. In March of 2002 and January of 2003, we measured air change rates in a 2 -bedroom apartment using the PFT technique.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{more than}} a decade of research on Aracena. La Minilla and El Gergal reservoirs, which belong to the water supply reservoir complex of Sevilla city (Spain). Aracena and La Minilla reservoirs were studied since July 1973 and El Gergal reservoir since October 1979. The results allowed the examination of the different factors which control thc interannual variability of the trophic state of the reservoirs. Because of the high variability of average yearly rainfall, that is characteristic of the Mediterranean climate asea, the water <b>renewal</b> <b>rate</b> of the reservoirs varies greatly from year to year. This water <b>renewal</b> <b>rate</b> plays a more important role than nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) availability in controlling algal biomass and consequently, primary production. Nevertheless, its relative importance depends on the phosphorus loading of each reservoir. In the case of La Minilla reservoir, water <b>renewal</b> <b>rate</b> is the only factor significantly correlated with phytoplankton biomass. In Aracena and El Gergal reservoirs both <b>renewal</b> <b>rate</b> and nutrient concentrations can account for the differences in biomass. In Aracena reservoir the highest phytoplankton biomass peaks occured in certain summers at the beginning of its history (when N/P ratio is less than 10) due to blooms of nitrogen fixing Cyanophyceae, but water <b>renewal</b> <b>rate</b> turned to be a more important controlling factor than nutrient concentration as years passed by.

A general fish bioaccumulation model extended with terms that account for effects of tank water <b>renewal</b> <b>rate</b> and system losses of chemicals, predicted strong effects of the water <b>renewal</b> <b>rate</b> of depuration tanks on geosmin depuration from European eel. Model predictions were validated in a depuration experiment with geosmin-loaded European eel (n = 95) with a mean (SD) individual weight of 134. 4 (5. 0) g and a mean (SD) lipid content of 33. 7 (2. 8) % (w/w). Fish were depurated for 24, 48 or 72 h at three different tank water <b>renewal</b> <b>rates</b> (0. 3, 3. 3 and 33 day- 1). Treatments were installed by three different mean (SD) water flow rates (13. 8 (1. 3), 143. 5 (9. 2) and 1511 (80) L kg fish- 1 day- 1) over 30 -L tanks. Eels eliminated geosmin from their bodies, but unlike the model predicted, this was independent of the water <b>renewal</b> <b>rate</b> of the depuration tanks. Although being eliminated from the fish, geosmin hardly appeared and certainly did not accumulate in {{the water of the}} depuration tanks as the model predicted. This observation may be explained by geosmin being eliminated from eel as metabolite rather than the parent compound. Geosmin elimination from eel seems not to occur according to the generally accepted passive diffusion mechanism for excretion of lipophilic chemicals, and geosmin biotransformation by the eel seems indicated. Clearly geosmin depuration from European eel cannot be enhanced by increasing water <b>renewal</b> <b>rates</b> of depuration tanks...|$|R

After 24 h, dramatic {{differences in the}} survival, dry weight, and biochemical composition of the rotifers depending on the <b>renewal</b> <b>rate</b> of microalgal cultures were observed. Survival after the feeding period increased with increasing <b>renewal</b> <b>rates.</b> Rotifers fed microalgae from low <b>renewal</b> <b>rate,</b> nutrient-deficient cultures showed low dry weight and organic contents {{very similar to those}} of the initial rotifers that were starved for 12 h before the start of the feeding period. On the contrary, rotifers fed nutrientsufficient microalgal cells underwent up to twofold increases of dry weight and protein, lipid, and carbohydrate contents with regard to rotifers fed nutrient-depleted N. gaditana. Consequently, feed conversion rate decreased in these conditions, indicating a better assimilation of the microalgal biomass obtained at high <b>renewal</b> <b>rates.</b> No single microalgal biochemical parameter among those studied can explain the response of the filter feeder. Similarly to gross composition, EPA and n- 3 contents in rotifers fed microalgae from nutrient-sufficient cultures were double than the contents found in rotifers fed nutrient-limited microalgae. In addition, very high positive correlations between the contents of EPA and n- 3 in N. gaditana and B. plicatilis were observed.

Different experiments have been conducted in an empty dwelling situated in a polluted area in Paris during winter and summer periods. The measured pollutants were indoor and outdoor CO, SO 2, NO, NO 2, O 3, VOC, PM 2. 5 particles and black smoke index. Additional measurements have been performed as meteorological conditions (wind speed and direction, external and internal temperature and humidity). The pollutants sampling time steps were comprised between two minutes and one hour depending on pollutant. The transfer of the pollutants has been tested as regards different ventilation strategies. <b>Air</b> <b>renewal</b> of the dwelling was thus controlled : the dwelling has been air tight and the residual air leakage has been characterised using blower door and tracer gas technique.

Winter and summer waters contain i) recharge water, or water from the variably saturated zone with rapid transfer and high nitrate concentrations, and ii) a large contribution (from 35 to 80 % in winter and summer, respectively) from the lower part of the aquifer (lower weathered aquifer and deep fractured aquifer). This induces not only a relatively rapid response of the catchment to variations {{in agricultural}} pressure, but also a potential inertia which has to be taken into account...|$|R
