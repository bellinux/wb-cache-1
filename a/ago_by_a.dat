The flood would have lasted several months, releasing as much as one million cubic metres of water per second. The cause of the breach is not known but may have been caused by an earthquake or simply the build-up of water pressure in the lake. As well as destroying the isthmus that connected Britain to continental Europe, the flood carved a large bedrock-floored valley {{down the length of the}} English Channel, leaving behind streamlined islands and longitudinal erosional grooves characteristic of catastrophic megaflood events.|$|E
25|$|In the Magic Land {{stories of}} Alexander Melentyevich Volkov, the {{prehistory}} is quite different. The land was created 6,000–7,000years <b>ago</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> wizard named Hurricap, who {{was tired of}} people coming to him with requests, {{so he decided to}} find a place without them annoying him. He found a remote land and separated it {{from the rest of the}} world, along with putting the enchantments of eternal spring and talking animals (Volkov's version doesn't include any forms of immortality). However, he failed to notice that the land already contained people (since he was a giant, already suffering from nearsightedness in his advanced age, and the people in the Magic Land were much shorter than in other places), but, upon discovering the fact, decided that removing the enchantments would be unnecessary. Instead, he ordered the people to keep away from his castle. After that, the notable events included a conquest attempt by a sorceress named Arachna (Gurrikap was still alive, and put her in an enchanted sleep for 5,000years. Her awakening formed the story for the fifth book in Volkov's series), an unsuccessful coup by a prince named Bofaro to overthrow his father about 1,000years ago (He and his accomplices were banished to an underground cave and became the Magic Land's main source of metal and gems, an analogue to the Nomes), and the arrival of the Four Witches (which only occurred about 500years ago in this continuity).|$|E

Cleveland consulted occasionally with President Theodore Roosevelt (1901–1909), but was financially unable to accept the chairmanship of the commission handling the Coal Strike of 1902. Cleveland still made his views known in political matters. In a 1905 article in The Ladies Home Journal, Cleveland weighed in on the women's suffrage movement, writing that [...] "sensible and responsible women do not want to vote.

500|$|In {{preparing}} for their mission, {{in addition to}} the usual Apollo spacecraft training, Young and Duke, along with backup commander Fred Haise, underwent an extensive geological training program that included several field trips to introduce them to concepts and techniques they would use in analyzing features and collecting samples on the lunar surface. During these trips, they visited and provided scientific descriptions of geologic features they were likely to encounter. In July 1971, they visited Sudbury, Ontario, Canada for geology training exercises, the first time U.S. astronauts did so. Geologists chose the area because of a [...] wide crater created about 1.8 billion years <b>ago</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> large meteorite. The Sudbury Basin shows evidence of shatter cone geology familiarizing the Apollo crew with geologic evidence of a meteor impact. During the training exercises the astronauts did not wear space suits, but carried radio equipment to converse with each other and scientist-astronaut Anthony W. England, practicing procedures they would use on the lunar surface.|$|E
500|$|Mauna Loa is {{a typical}} shield volcano in form, taking {{the shape of a}} long, broad dome {{extending}} down to the ocean floor whose slopes are about 12° at their steepest, a consequence of its extremely fluid lava. The shield-stage lavas that built the enormous main mass of the mountain are tholeiitic basalts, like those of Mauna Kea, created through the mixing of primary magma and subducted oceanic crust. Mauna Loa's summit hosts three overlapping pit craters arranged northeast-southwest, the first and last roughly [...] in diameter and the second an oblong [...] feature; together these three craters make up the [...] summit caldera Mokuʻāweoweo, so named for the Hawaiian ʻāweoweo fish (Priacanthus meeki), purportedly due to the resemblance of its eruptive fires to the coloration of the fish. Mokuʻāweoweo's caldera floor lies between [...] beneath its rim and it is only the latest of several calderas that have formed and reformed over the volcano's life. It was created between 1,000 and 1,500 years <b>ago</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> large eruption from Mauna Loa's northeast rift zone, which emptied out a shallow magma chamber beneath the summit and collapsed it into its present form. Additionally, two smaller pit craters lie southwest of the caldera, named Lua Hou (New Pit) and Lua Hohonu (Deep Pit).|$|E

500|$|... "Halos" [...] are massive ringworlds, {{ranging from}} {{thousands}} {{to tens of}} thousands of kilometers in diameter, scattered across the galaxy. These rings were constructed thousands of years <b>ago</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> race known as the Forerunners as weapons of last resort against the parasitic alien species known as the Flood. When activated, the Halos would destroy all sentient life in the galaxy, depriving the Flood of its food. The Forerunners disappeared after they activated the rings. In , whilst fleeing the Covenant, the UNSC ship Pillar of Autumn stumbled upon one of these ringworlds, Installation 04. The humans manage to destroy the ring, stopping the Flood; the Covenant, unaware of the destructive nature of the rings, attempt to fire another ring, Installation 05, during Halo 2 in order to fulfill their religious prophecy. One race in the Covenant, the Elites, learn the truth about the rings, and join forces with humanity in order to stop the firing of the ring. Though they are successful, the unexpected shutdown of the installation triggers a fail-safe protocol, priming all the rings for firing from one location, referred to as the Ark. Still oblivious to the true nature of the rings, the Covenant High Prophet of Truth and the remaining loyalist Covenant proceed to head to Earth, where they believe the Ark is buried.|$|E

2500|$|The {{story is}} set in fictional Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp, a remote US {{government}} training facility {{under the guise of}} a children's summer camp. The area was hit centuries <b>ago</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> meteor made of psitanium (a fictional element that can grant psychic powers or strengthen existing powers), creating a huge crater. The psitanium affected the local wildlife, giving them limited psychic powers, such as bears with the ability to attack with telekinetic claws and cougars with pyrokinesis. The Native Americans of the area called psitanium [...] "whispering rock", which they used to build arrowheads. When settlers began inhabiting the region, the psychoactive properties of the meteor slowly drove them insane. An asylum was built to house the afflicted, but within fifteen years, the asylum had more residents than the town did. The government relocated the remaining inhabitants and flooded the crater to prevent further settlement, creating what is now Lake Oblongata. The asylum still stands, but has fallen into disrepair.|$|E
2500|$|The {{series is}} set within {{a number of}} artificially {{constructed}} parallel universes (of which Earth is one), created {{tens of thousands of}} years <b>ago</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> race of human beings not from Earth who had achieved an advanced level of technology which gave them almost godlike power and immortality. The principal universe in which these stories take place, and from which the series derives its name, consists of an enormous tiered planet, shaped like a stack of disks or squat cylinders, of diminishing radius, one atop the other. The series follows the adventures of several of these godlike humans and several [...] "ordinary" [...] humans from Earth who accidentally travel to these artificial universes. (One of those [...] "ordinary" [...] humans was Paul Janus Finnegan (PJF) who becomes the main character in the series.)

Roger Zelazny has mentioned that The World of Tiers was something he had in his mind when he created his Amber series.
