5|$|A {{brain and}} a subtle ear {{has gone into}} the making of this poem...celebrating the mystery of Christ's conception. Dew falling on grass, flower <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> (traditional imagery, {{deriving}} from OT texts such as Psalm 72:6) suggests ease, grace and delicacy generally (not progressive stages of insemination). The emphasis on Mary's freedom of choice, {{at the moment of}} the annunciation, is theologically strictly proper.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{presented}} from a single, 2D perspective, and revolves around Robbie the Robot's objective {{to defend his}} plant from interstellar space slugs. The plant grows from a pot at the bottom centre of the screen, <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> cans containing three different pesticides are located on ledges {{on each side of}} the screen. Bonus items such as fertiliser and spades appear on unoccupied ledges which will increase both the players score and the plant's growth rate.|$|E

5|$|Most Iridomyrmex {{species are}} {{aggressive}} ants that will attack anything which attacks or disturbs their nests or trails they forage on. This is noticeable with particular member {{species of the}} I. purpureus species group, where they will pour out of their nest and attack and kill all intruders. Even smaller species show similar behaviours to these ants and will also swarm out of their nests to bite <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> iridomyrmecin, a defensive chemical found in the genus. Because of their large numbers, aggression, and activeness, Iridomyrmex ants are ecologically dominant in Australia, and several species are known to obtain exclusive possession to food sources and prevent other insects from using them. These ants will also affect foraging behaviours of other ant nests living nearby due to how active they are and their large numbers.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{meets with}} Skinner and Leamus, {{telling them that}} the New Spartans are {{planning}} to rob a bank and that Haley wants copies of surveillance files on the group, {{in an attempt to}} discover the spy's identity. Leamus, expecting the request, hands over a redacted microfilm for Haley to see. Scully discovers that the biological weapon was engineered by the U.S. government, and concludes that someone purposely sent Mulder on a suicide mission. She realizes that the pathogen is spread through touch, and that New Spartans plan to spread it via the money in the bank. Meanwhile, Mulder joins the New Spartans as they infiltrate the bank <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> the money with the pathogen.|$|E
5|$|Rocksteady decided {{early on}} in {{development}} to make Arkham Knight only for the then-upcoming next-generation of consoles, which was considered {{to allow them to}} focus on using the system resources to their fullest without reining in their ideas to accommodate the older generation systems. The game allows for up to five times the number of on-screen enemies as were possible in Arkham City, and riots can feature up to fifty on-screen enemies interacting with the environment to smash items, <b>and</b> <b>spray</b> graffiti. The technical changes also allowed for cutscenes to be rendered in real time in the game engine, where previous installments had used pre-rendered videos to compensate. Describing the scale of difference between Arkham Knight and earlier games, lead character artist Albert Feliu said that a single character model in Arkham Knight could contain the same amount of polygons used to render the entirety of Arkham Asylums environment. Arkham Knight is the first in the series to use the Apex physics simulation engine to have items like cloth, such as Batman's cape, react realistically to movement or wind. Warner Bros. supported Rocksteady's concept for the game, but both parties felt that three years was too long to wait between games, so WB Games Montréal was tasked with creating the prequel, Arkham Origins, to fill the gap.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} a better {{understanding}} of the transient nature of axisymmetric gas jets <b>and</b> <b>sprays</b> under diesel conditions. To evaluate the performances of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and the large eddy simulation (LES) modeling approaches, a comparative computational study using both methodologies has been performed for the same computational cases with the same numerical algorithm and spatial resolution. The results show that LES is capable of capturing the unsteady features of transient gas jets <b>and</b> <b>sprays</b> such as flow vortical structures, whereas RANS is incapable of resolving these features. Furthermore, the excessive dissipation in the RANS simulation can lead to underprediction of the jet penetration, while LES can better represent the jet mixing and entrainment, which offers a promising tool for numerical prediction of transient jets <b>and</b> <b>sprays...</b>|$|R

40|$|The micro-scale wear–corrosion {{interactions}} of WC-based sintered hardmetals <b>and</b> <b>sprayed</b> coatings are typically investigated {{by comparing the}} wear-rates in corrosive environments with neutral (pH 7) conditions and inferring electrochemical activity. However, for {{a greater understanding of}} the wear–corrosion interactions, {{there is a need to}} examine the repassivation kinetics during micro-abrasion tests under different pH conditions. This paper details in situ electrochemical current-noise measurements performed using a modified micro-abrasion tester to elucidate these wear–corrosion interactions for pH 7 – 13 conditions for sintered WC– 5. 7 Co– 0. 3 Cr <b>and</b> <b>sprayed</b> WC– 10 Co– 4 Cr specimens. Electrochemical measurements and SEM micrographs of worn surfaces are used to detail the degradation process. Discussion will focus on the wear–corrosion interactions present under neutral and alkaline conditions for sintered <b>and</b> <b>sprayed</b> specimens <b>and</b> the influence of microstructure on the electrochemical activity will be detailed...|$|R
