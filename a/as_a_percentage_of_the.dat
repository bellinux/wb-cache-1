40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} government budget deficits, defence expenditure and income redistribution among different social-income groups in Turkey for the period 1965 - 2003. The analysis {{was based on a}} five-equation vector auto regressive (VAR) model and impulse response functions (IRFs) derived from the VAR model. The study finds that the deficit <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> GNP has <b>a</b> negative and significant impact on transfer payments <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> GNP. The IRFs indicate that shocks to deficit expenditures <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> GNP (DEFGNP) have statistically significant impacts on defence spending <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> GNP (DSGNP), educational expenditures <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> GNP (EDGNP), health expenditures <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> GNP (HEGNP), and transfer payments <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> GNP (TPGNP). The results derived from this study also indicate that there is a positive and significant relationship between defence spending <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> GNP and deficits <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> GNP. Therefore, defence spending is viewed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tool for transferring income among different social-income groups and across generations in Turkey for the period 1965 - 2004. As a result of this, the government can use deficit and defence spending as one of the major instruments to transfer income among different social-income groups and across generations in Turkey.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{publication}} of his memoirs, Chaplin began work on A Countess from Hong Kong (1967), a romantic comedy based on a script he had written for Paulette Goddard in the 1930s. Set on an ocean liner, it starred Marlon Brando as an American ambassador and Sophia Loren as a stowaway found in his cabin. The film differed from Chaplin's earlier productions in several aspects. It was his first to use Technicolor and the widescreen format, while he concentrated on directing and appeared on-screen only in a cameo role as a seasick steward. He also signed a deal with Universal Pictures and appointed his assistant, Jerome Epstein, as the producer. Chaplin was paid $600,000 director's fee as well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gross receipts. A Countess from Hong Kong premiered in January 1967, to unfavourable reviews, and was a box-office failure.
