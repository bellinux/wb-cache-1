5|$|In {{spite of}} the few major operations, {{the first decade of}} the boom was {{dominated}} by numerous small producers. As production expanded and new companies were formed, consolidation occurred. By the late 1920s, ten companies produced more than half of the oil in the state: Gulf Production Company, Humble Oil <b>and</b> <b>Refining</b> Company, Southern Crude Oil Purchasing Company (later absorbed by Amoco which was later absorbed by BP), the Texas Company, Shell Petroleum Corporation, Yount-Lee Oil Company, Magnolia Petroleum Company, J.

5|$|One {{suitable}} {{method for}} purification for the raw platinum, which contains platinum, gold, {{and the other}} platinum-group metals, is to process it with aqua regia, in which palladium, gold and platinum are dissolved, whereas osmium, iridium, ruthenium and rhodium stay unreacted. The gold is precipitated {{by the addition of}} iron(II) chloride and after filtering off the gold, the platinum is precipitated as ammonium chloroplatinate by the addition of ammonium chloride. Ammonium chloroplatinate can be converted to platinum by heating. Unprecipitated hexachloroplatinate(IV) may be reduced with elemental zinc, and a similar method is suitable for small scale recovery of platinum from laboratory residues.

5|$|The {{atmosphere}} is a chaotic system. As a result, small changes to {{one part of}} the system can accumulate and magnify to cause large effects on the system as a whole.

However, it is theoretically impossible to make useful day-to-day predictions more than about two weeks ahead, imposing an upper limit to potential for improved prediction skill.|$|E

5|$|After version 1.0 {{had been}} finished, the engine's code name White Engine {{was changed to}} the {{official}} title Crystal Tools. This was not only done to represent {{the company and its}} works better, but also due to the refractive effects of real-life crystals that were meant to symbolize the flexibility of the engine. Over the next few months, the programmers advanced the engine to version 1.1 and added preliminary support for the Wii. In September 2011, Final Fantasy Versus XIII director Tetsuya Nomura announced that his team had replaced Crystal Tools with a proprietary action game engine that was supplemented by the lighting technology of the company's new Luminous Studio engine.

40|$|Abstract–Bug fixing {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} activities in software development and maintenance. Bugs are report-ed, recorded, and managed in bug tracking systems such as Bugzilla. In general, a bug report contains many fields, such as product, component, severity, priority, fixer, operating system (OS), platform, etc., which provide important information for the bug triaging and fixing process. Our previous study finds that approximately 80 % of bug reports have their fields reassigned <b>and</b> <b>refined</b> at least once, and bugs with reassigned <b>and</b> <b>refined</b> fields take more time to fix than bugs with no reassigned <b>and</b> <b>refined</b> fields.

5|$|Consuming 75% of production, {{the primary}} use for {{strontium}} is in glass for colour television cathode ray tubes, where it prevents X-ray emission. This application for strontium is declining because CRTs are {{being replaced by}} other display methods. This decline has a significant influence on the mining <b>and</b> <b>refining</b> of strontium. All parts of the CRT must absorb X-rays. In the neck and the funnel of the tube, lead glass is used for this purpose, but this type of glass shows a browning effect due to {{the interaction of the}} X-rays with the glass. Therefore, the front panel is made from a different glass mixture with strontium and barium to absorb the X-rays. The average values for the glass mixture determined for a recycling study in 2005 is 8.5% strontium oxide and 10% barium oxide.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, mining {{operations}} in Silver Reef resumed {{under the direction}} of Alex Colbath, who organized the area's mines into the Silver Reef Consolidated Mining Company. These mines were purchased by American Smelting <b>and</b> <b>Refining</b> Company in 1928, but the company did minimal work {{as a result of the}} Great Depression. The Western Gold & Uranium Corporation purchased Silver Reef's mines in 1948, and in 1951, they began mining uranium in the area. These operations did not last long either, and the Western Gold & Uranium Corporation sold their mines to the 5M Corporation in 1979. Today, the Wells Fargo office, the Cosmopolitan Restaurant, the Rice Building, and numerous foundations and walls remain in the town site, and a few dozen homes have been constructed in the area.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Humble Oil <b>and</b> <b>Refining</b> Company sent a {{specially}} fitted oil tanker, the , {{to test the}} feasibility of transporting oil via ice-breaking tankers to market. The Manhattan was fitted with an ice-breaking bow, powerful engines, and hardened propellers before successfully traveling the Northwest Passage from the Atlantic Ocean to the Beaufort Sea. During the voyage, the ship suffered damage to several of its cargo holds, which flooded with seawater. Wind-blown ice forced the Manhattan to change its intended route from the M'Clure Strait to the smaller Prince of Wales Strait. It was escorted back through the Northwest Passage by a Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker, the CCGS John A. Macdonald. Although the Manhattan transited the Northwest Passage again {{in the summer of}} 1970, the concept was considered too risky. A pipeline was thus the only viable system for transporting the oil to the nearest port free of pack-ice, almost 800 miles (1,300km) away at Valdez.|$|E

In the middle of 1953, Amdur and her husband developed a method of spraying a combination mist of sulfuric acid and sulfur dioxide into humid chambers containing guinea pigs {{to investigate}} the damage that it would cause to their lungs. Guinea pigs were used as they breathe more deeply through their mouths than smaller rodents which breathe through their noses.

Nelson had devised a plan of attack that anticipated the allied fleet would form up in a traditional line of battle.

5|$|While {{mercury and}} zinc {{minerals}} {{are found in}} large enough quantities to be mined, cadmium is too similar to zinc and therefore is always present in small quantities in zinc ores from where it is recovered. Identified world zinc resources total about 1.9 billion tonnes. Large deposits are in Australia, Canada and the United States with the largest reserves in Iran. At {{the current rate of}} consumption, these reserves are estimated to be depleted sometime between 2027 and 2055. About 346 million tonnes have been extracted throughout history to 2002, and one estimate found that about 109 million tonnes of that remains in use. In 2005, China was the top producer of mercury with almost two-thirds global share followed by Kyrgyzstan. Several other countries are believed to have unrecorded production of mercury from copper electrowinning processes and by recovery from effluents. Because of the high toxicity of mercury, both the mining of cinnabar <b>and</b> <b>refining</b> for mercury are hazardous and historic causes of mercury poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth was {{purchased}} from the American Smelting <b>and</b> <b>Refining</b> Company {{of the highest}} purity that it could produce. It was sent to Hanford, where it was put in aluminum cans, and placed inside a reactor for 100 days. The canned slugs then shipped to Unit IV, where they were bathed in hydrochloric acid, which dissolved the aluminum. This formed an aluminum chloride solution that was disposed of, as it was highly radioactive due to iron and copper in the aluminum alloy. The bismuth slugs were then dissolved in aqua regia. This was too weak for electroplating the polonium, so the nitric acid was removed, and then the polonium deposited on bismuth by adding powdered bismuth. This resulted in a 100–1 concentration. This could then be repeated by dissolving in aqua regia again to achieve a 1000–1 concentration. This was again dissolved, and the polonium electroplated on platinum foils. The main problem with the process was that it required glass-lined containers due to the aqua regia, and mechanisms for safe handling of the radioactive material. The Dayton Project explored alternative purification methods that {{were found to be}} workable, but less efficient or safe.|$|E
