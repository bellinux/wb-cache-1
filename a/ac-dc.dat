Conventional <b>AC-DC</b> converters generally have two conversion stages – an <b>AC-DC</b> front-end stage that operates {{with some sort of}} power factor correction to ensure good power quality at the input, and a DC-DC conversion stage that takes the DC output of the front-end converter and converts it to the desired output DC voltage. Due to the cost of having two separate and independent converters, there has been considerable research on so-called single-stage converters – converters that can simultaneously perform <b>AC-DC</b> and DC-DC conversion with only a single converter stage.
