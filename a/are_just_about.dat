[...] In Pennies from Heaven, she played Eileen Everson, a schoolteacher turned prostitute. Of her performance in Pennies From Heaven, John DiLeo wrote that she [...] "is not only poignant as you'd expect but has a surprising inner strength." [...] Pauline Kael wrote in The New Yorker: [...] "Peters is mysteriously right in every nuance." [...] Kael further noted that [...] "The dance numbers are funny, amazing, and beautiful all at once; several of them <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> perfection." ...|$|E

Here, Mary, with God's kind permission, we will make our home; and I have every reason to believe a home it will truly be." ...|$|E
500|$|During the Steve Lillywhite sessions, Lee {{described}} the album as a [...] "rainbow of sounds" [...] with heavy, stripped-out songs. According to Lee, it had electro influences {{and a lot}} of drum programming. During the later sessions with Nick Raskulincecz, she discussed two of the album's themes: brokenness ("Brokenness has become a little bit of theme, without necessarily offering a solution") and oceans. In a later MTV interview, Lee mentioned other themes: [...] "the quest for freedom, and then there's songs that <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> falling in love". She said that Evanescence used new and vintage instruments (such as a harp, synthesizers and the Moog Taurus Pedal) and recorded the ballads [...] "Secret Door" [...] and [...] "My Heart Is Broken". In a Kerrang! interview, Lee said she was inspired by her life and personal relationships.|$|E

500|$|In 1964, Simone changed record {{distributors}} {{from the}} American Colpix to the Dutch Philips, which also meant {{a change in}} the contents of her recordings. She had always included songs in her repertoire that drew upon her African-American origins (such as [...] "Brown Baby" [...] by Oscar Brown and [...] "Zungo" [...] by Michael Olatunji in her album Nina at the Village Gate in 1962). On her debut album for Philips, Nina Simone in Concert (live recording, 1964), {{for the first time she}} openly addressed the racial inequality that was prevalent in the United States with the song [...] "Mississippi Goddam", her response to the June 12, 1963, murder of Medgar Evers and the September 15, 1963, bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, that killed four young black girls and partially blinded a fifth girl who survived. She remarked that the title and the song itself was, [...] "like throwing 10 bullets back at them", becoming one of many other protest songs written by Simone. The song was released as a single, and it was boycotted in certain southern states. Specifically, promotional copies were smashed by a Carolina radio station and returned to Simone's record label. Simone later recalled how [...] "Mississippi Goddam" [...] was her [...] "first civil rights song" [...] and that the song came to her [...] "in a rush of fury, hatred and determination". The song was a direct challenge to widely held beliefs that race relations could change gradually and called for more immediate developments, [...] "me and my people <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> due". It was a key moment in her political radicalization. [...] "Old Jim Crow", on the same album, addressed the Jim Crow laws.|$|E

2500|$|... "Thought I Knew" [...] {{was also}} {{the name of a}} song by Brian Bell's band The Relationship, and is a {{reworking}} and re-recording of the track with Weezer sung as a lead vocal by Brian Bell. The song was originally written in a minor key. However, Bell felt that historically the band's songs haven't worked in minor and that the song needed to feel more uplifting. So he changed the song from minor to major and sped up the tempo. [...] "Cold Dark World" [...] is a song that was written by Rivers Cuomo and Scott Shriner and features Shriner on lead vocals. Shriner commented, [...] "...I wrote this kind of creepy music, and Rivers wrote these kind of happy, positive lyrics, but when you put it together, it made a super-creepy song which I'm really proud of." [...] "Automatic" [...] was written by Patrick Wilson and features him on lead vocals, saying that the song [...] "is interesting. It's a big rock tune but it's kinda got a vibe to it and the lyrics <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> me wanting to give as much love as I can to my family..." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 1809, Antonie {{returned}} to Vienna {{to care for}} her ailing father, who died on October 30, 1809. After his death, Antonie remained in Vienna for three years to sort out her father's art collection and supervise its sale. Franz Brentano established a branch of his business in Vienna and joined his wife there. Bettina von Arnim, in her epistolary novel Goethe's Correspondence with a Child describes Birkenstock's collection as follows: [...] "I am much pleased with the old tower, from whence I overlook the whole Prater: trees on trees of majestic appearance, delightful green lawns. [...] Here I live in the house of the deceased Birkenstock, in the midst of two thousand engravings, as many drawings, as many hundred antique urns, and Etrurian lamps, marble vases, antique remains of hands and feet, pictures, Chinese dresses, coins, collections of minerals, sea-insects, telescopes, countless maps, plans of ancient buried kingdoms and cities, skilfully carved sticks, valuable documents, and lastly the sword of the Emperor Carolus. [...] All these surround us in gay confusion, and <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> being brought into order, so there is nothing to be touched or understood, and with the chesnut-alley in full blossom, and the rushing Danube, which bears us over on his back, there is no enduring the Gallery of Art." ...|$|E
2500|$|Williams told MTV {{that she}} couldn't [...] "wait {{for the world}} to hear [...] new solo album", {{describing}} it as [...] "fresher", [...] "more inspirational", and [...] "more on the secular side". Furthermore, she stated [...] "whether it's gospel or not, I wrote about it", therefore expecting [...] "some of her gospel fans to be a little upset" [...] but wanted to [...] "keep it real". She also discussed one of the album's [...] "primary themes" [...] – [...] "what it's like to be in love" [...] – explaining [...] " [...] mistakes you make when you're in love and how they affect your life" [...] after saying [...] "I was able to experience some things this year and I wrote about them." [...] In describing the album during another interview, this time for GospelCity, Williams said [...] "these songs <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> the real me" [...] and that she [...] "just wrote from [...] heart" [...] before acknowledging that [...] "it didn't turn out to be as 'gospel-ly' as some would have liked", but [...] "the stuff" [...] that's on the album [...] "is stuff [...] went through". Williams then said [...] "this whole album is about God's love and me". After being asked [...] "Michelle, as people listen to the album, Do You Know, as they get acquainted with the songs, what are you hoping to bring to their lives?", Williams responded [...] "That everybody live in peace and not settle for anything less than what the Lord wants to bring your way. I know what I went through, I know God is taking me to another level. I had people around me that were not going where I was going – I had to release them from my life." ...|$|E
