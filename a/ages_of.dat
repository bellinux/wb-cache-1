40|$|The {{risk for}} {{cardiovascular}} disease (CVD) is higher {{for individuals with}} a first-degree relative who developed premature CVD (with a threshold at age 55 years for a male or 65 years for a female). However, {{little is known about}} the effect that each unit increase or decrease of maternal or paternal <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset of CVD has on offspring <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset of CVD. We hypothesized that there is an association between maternal and paternal <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset of CVD and offspring <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset of CVD. We used the Framingham Heart Study database and performed conditional imputation for CVD-censored parental age (i. e. parents that didn't experience onset of CVD) and Cox proportional regression analysis, with offspring's <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset of CVD as the dependent variable and parental <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset of CVD as the primary predictor. Modifiable risk factors in offspring, such as cigarette smoking, body mass index (BMI), diabetes mellitus, systolic blood pressure (SBP), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level, were controlled for. Separate analyses were performed for the association between maternal <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset of CVD and offspring <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset of CVD and the association between paternal <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset of CVD and offspring <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset <b>of</b> CVD. Parental <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset of CVD was predictive <b>of</b> offspring <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset of CVD for maternal <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset of CVD (P <. 0001; N = 1401) and for paternal <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset of CVD (P = 0. 0134; N = 1221). A negative estimate of the coefficient of interest signifies that late onset of cardiovascular events in parents is protective of onset of CVD in offspring. Cigarette smoking and HDL level were important associated confounders. Offspring <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset of cardiovascular disease is significantly associated with both maternal and paternal <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset CVD. The incorporation of the parameters, maternal or paternal <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset of CVD, into risk estimate calculators may improve accuracy of identification of high-risk patients in clinical settings...|$|R

5|$|Juveniles have lighter greys {{and browns}} amidst the starker {{blacks and whites}} of their plumage; two- or three-year-old birds of both sexes closely {{resemble}} and are difficult to distinguish from adult females. Immature birds have dark brownish eyes until around two years of age. Australian magpies generally live to around 25 years of age, though <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> up to 30 years have been recorded. The reported age of first breeding has varied according to area, but the average is between the <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> three and five years.|$|E
5|$|Since Ankylosaurus {{and other}} Late Cretaceous North American ankylosaurids grouped with Asian genera (in a tribe the authors named Ankylosaurini), Arbour and Currie {{suggested}} that earlier North American ankylosaurids had gone extinct {{by the late}} Albian or Cenomanian <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> the Middle Cretaceous. Ankylosaurids thereafter recolonised North America from Asia during the Campanian or Turonian <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> the Late Cretaceous, and diversified there again, leading to genera such as Ankylosaurus, Anodontosaurus, and Euoplocephalus. This explains a 30 million year gap in the fossil record of North American ankylosaurids between these ages.|$|E

50|$|The {{history of}} Odia {{literature}} has been mapped by historians along the following stages, Old Oriya (900-1300 CE), Early Middle Oriya (1300-1500 CE), Middle Oriya (1500-1700 CE), Late Middle Oriya (1700-1850 CE) and Modern Oriya (from 1850 CE till the present). But this crude categorization could not skillfully draw the real picture {{on account of}} development and growth of Odia literature. Here, we split the total periods in different stages such as: <b>Age</b> <b>of</b> Charya Literature, <b>Age</b> <b>of</b> Sarala Das, <b>Age</b> <b>of</b> Panchasakha, <b>Age</b> <b>of</b> Upendra Bhanja, <b>Age</b> <b>of</b> Radhanath, <b>Age</b> <b>of</b> Satyabadi, <b>Age</b> <b>of</b> Marxism or Pragati yuga, <b>Age</b> <b>of</b> Romanticism or Sabuja Yuga, Post Independent Age.|$|R
