40|$|New {{large-scale}} synthetic {{approach to}} antiretroviral agent 9 -[2 -(R) -(phosphonomethoxy) propyl]- 2, 6 -diaminopurine, (R) -PMPDAP, was developed. Reaction of (R) -propanediol carbonate with 2, 6 -diaminopurine afforded exclusively (R) - 9 -(2 -hydroxypropyl) - 2, 6 -diaminopurine which was subsequently used for {{introduction of a}} phosphonomethyl residue using TsOCH(2) P(O) (OiPr) (2) or BrCH(2) P(O) (OiPr) (2) followed by deprotection of ester groups. All minor ingredients and by-products formed during the process were identified and further studied. The final product was obtained in high yield and its high enantiomeric purity (> 99 %) was confirmed by chiral capillary electrophoretic analysis using β-cyclodextrin as a chiral selector. Antiretroviral activity data of (R) -PMPDAP and its diverse prodrugs against HIV and FIV were investigated. Akin to (R) -PMPDAP, both prodrugs inhibit FIV replication in a selective manner. Compared to the parent molecule, the amidate prodrug was 10 -fold less active against FIV in cell culture, whereas the <b>alkoxyalkyl</b> <b>ester</b> prodrug was 200 -fold more potent in inhibiting FIV replication in vitro. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Patients {{infected}} with {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) often suffer from herpesvirus infections {{as a result of}} immunosuppression. These infections can occur while patients are receiving antiretroviral therapy, and additional drugs required to treat their infection can adversely affect compliance. It would be useful to have antivirals with a broader spectrum of activity that included both HIV and the herpesviruses. We reported previously that <b>alkoxyalkyl</b> <b>ester</b> prodrugs of cidofovir are up to 3 orders of magnitude more active against herpesvirus replication and may be less toxic than the unmodified drug. To determine if this strategy would be effective for certain phosphonomethoxyethyl nucleoside phosphonates which are also active against HIV infections, the hexadecyloxypropyl (HDP) esters of 1 -(phosphonomethoxyethyl) -cytosine, 1 -(phosphonomethoxyethyl) - 5 -bromo-cytosine (PME- 5 BrC), 1 -(phosphonomethoxyethyl) - 5 -fluoro-cytosine, 9 -(phosphonomethoxyethyl) - 2, 6 -diaminopurine (PME-DAP), and 9 -(phosphonomethoxyethyl) - 2 -amino- 6 -cyclopropylaminopurine (PME-cPrDAP) were evaluated for activity against herpesvirus replication. The HDP esters were substantially more active than the unmodified acyclic nucleoside phosphonates, indicating that esterification with alkoxyalkyl groups increases the antiviral activity of many acyclic nucleoside phosphonates. The most interesting compounds included HDP-PME-cPrDAP and HDP-PME-DAP, which were 12 - to 43 -fold more active than the parent nucleoside phosphonates against herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus, and HDP-PME-cPrDAP and HDP-PME- 5 BrC which were especially active against Epstein-Barr virus. The results presented here indicate that HDP-esterified acyclic nucleoside phosphonates with antiviral activity against HIV also inhibit the replication of some herpesviruses and can extend the spectrum of activity for these compounds...|$|E
40|$|Acyclic {{nucleoside}} phosphonates (ANPs) and {{in particular}} (S) - 1 -[3 -hydroxy- 2 -(phosphonomethoxy) propyl]cytosine (HPMPC, cidofovir, CDV, Vistide((R))) and its adenine counterpart (S) - 9 -[3 -hydroxy- 2 -(phosphonomethoxy) propyl]adenine [(S) -HPMPA] are highly active against orf virus infections. This parapoxvirus commonly causes infection in sheep, goats, but also humans. <b>Alkoxyalkyl</b> <b>esters</b> of CDV have an increased oral bioavailability and are more active against orthopoxviruses than the parent compounds. In the present study, the potency of several <b>alkoxyalkyl</b> <b>esters</b> of CDV, cyclic cidofovir (cCDV) and (S) -HPMPA was evaluated against different orf virus isolates in two cell types, human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblast and primary lamb keratinocytes. Each prodrug was at least 10 -fold more active than its parent compound in both cell types. Of all the compounds tested, the (S) -HPMPA <b>alkoxyalkyl</b> <b>esters</b> showed the highest activity and selectivity against orf virus. Our results support the development of <b>alkoxyalkyl</b> <b>esters</b> of ANPs as antivirals {{not only for the}} treatment of complicated human orf lesions, but also in the therapy and prophylaxis of contagious ecthyma in sheep and goats. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|<b>Alkoxyalkyl</b> <b>esters</b> of {{cidofovir}} (CDV) have substantially greater antiviral {{activity and}} selectivity than unmodified CDV against herpesviruses and orthopoxviruses in vitro. Enhancement of antiviral activity was also noted when cyclic CDV was esterified with alkoxyalkanols. In vitro antiviral {{activity of the}} most active analogs against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and orthopoxviruses was increased relative to CDV up to 1, 000 - or 200 -fold, respectively. Alkyl chain length and linker structure are important potential modifiers of antiviral activity and selectivity. In this study, we synthesized a series of <b>alkoxyalkyl</b> <b>esters</b> of CDV or cyclic CDV with alkyl chains from 8 to 24 atoms and having linker moieties of glycerol, propanediol, and ethanediol. We also synthesized alkyl esters of CDV which lack the linker to determine if the alkoxyalkyl linker moiety is required for activity. The new compounds were evaluated in vitro against HCMV and murine CMV (MCMV). CDV or cyclic CDV analogs both with and without linker moieties were highly active against HCMV and MCMV, and their activities were strongly dependent on chain length. The most active compounds had 20 atoms esterified to the phosphonate of CDV. Both alkoxypropyl and alkyl esters of CDV provided enhanced antiviral activities against CMV in vitro. Thus, the oxypropyl linker moiety is not required for enhanced activity. CDV analogs having alkyl ethers linked to glycerol or ethanediol linker groups also demonstrated increased activity against CMV...|$|R
40|$|<b>Alkoxyalkyl</b> <b>esters</b> of acyclic {{nucleoside}} phosphonates {{have previously}} {{been shown to}} have increased antiviral activity when they are administered orally in animal models of viral diseases, including lethal infections with vaccinia virus, cowpox virus, ectromelia virus, murine cytomegalovirus, and adenovirus. 9 -(S) -(3 -Hydroxy- 2 -phosphonomethoxypropyl) adenine [(S) -HPMPA] was previously shown to have activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV) in vitro. To assess the effect of alkoxyalkyl esterification of (S) -HPMPA, we prepared the hexadecyloxypropyl (HDP), 15 -methyl-hexadecyloxypropyl (15 M-HDP), and octadecyloxyethyl (ODE) esters and compared their activities with the activity of adefovir dipivoxil in vitro and in vivo. <b>Alkoxyalkyl</b> <b>esters</b> of (S) -HPMPA were 6 to 20 times more active than unmodified (S) -HPMPA {{on the basis of their}} 50 % effective concentrations in 2. 2. 15 cells. The increased antiviral activity appeared to be due in part to the increased uptake and conversion of HDP-(S) -HPMPA to HPMPA diphosphate observed in HepG 2 cells in vitro. HDP-(S) -HPMPA retained full activity against HBV mutants resistant to lamivudine (L 180 M, M 204 V), but cross-resistance to a mutant resistant to adefovir (N 236 T) was detected. HDP-(S) -HPMPA is orally bioavailable and provides excellent liver exposure to the drug. Oral treatment of HBV transgenic mice with HDP-(S) -HPMPA, 15 M-HDP-(S) -HPMPA, and ODE-(S) -HPMPA for 14 days reduced liver HBV DNA levels by roughly 1. 5 log units, a response equivalent to that of adefovir dipivoxil...|$|R

We synthesized several <b>alkoxyalkyl</b> <b>esters</b> of (S) -HPMPA and now report that hexadecyloxypropyl-(S) -HPMPA [HDP-(S) -HPMPA] and octadecyloxyethyl-(S) -HPMPA [ODE-(S) -HPMPA]had 50 % effective concentrations of 0. 4 to 7. 0 nanomolar and were nearly fully active against HIV variants having reverse transcriptase mutations M 184 V and K 103 N and against a zidovudine-resistant variant with mutations D 67 N, K 70 R, T 215 Y, and K 219 Q. Resistance to HDP-(S) -HPMPA and ODE-(S) -HPMPA was noted for a mutant with mutation K 65 R. HDP-(S) -HPMPA is also active against herpes simplex virus type 1, human cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B virus, adenoviruses, and orthopoxviruses and is worthy of further evaluation as a possibly therapy for HIV infection...|$|R

The bis(POC) and the bis(amino acid) phosphoramidate prodrugs of PMEO-DAPy inhibited herpesvirus replication at lower doses than the parent compound although the selectivity against HSV and VZV was only slightly improved compared to PMEO-DAPy. The mono-octadecyl ester of PME- 5 -azaC emerged as the most potent and selective PME- 5 -azaC prodrug against HSV, VZV and HCMV with EC 50 's of 0. 15 - 1. 12 µM while PME- 5 -azaC only had marginal anti-herpesvirus activity.

In MCMV-infected BALB/c mice, oral HDP-(S) -HPMPA at 30 mg/kg significantly reduced mortality when started 24 - 48 h post inoculation. In the experimental HCMV infection, oral administration of vehicle or 10 mg/kg of (S) -HPMPA, HDP-(S) -HPMPA or ODE-(S) -HPMPA was initiated 24 h after infection and continued for 28 consecutive days. Cidofovir (CDV), at 20 mg/kg given i. p., {{was used as a}} positive control. HDP-(S) -HPMPA or ODE-(S) -HPMPA significantly reduced viral replication compared to vehicle treated mice, while oral (S) -HPMPA was ineffective.

40|$|The {{nucleotide}} phosphonates cidofovir (CDV) and cyclic cidofovir (cCDV) are potent antiviral compounds when administered parenterally but are {{not well}} absorbed orally. These compounds {{have been reported to}} have activity against orthopoxvirus replication in vitro and in animal models when administered parenterally or by aerosol. To obtain better oral activity, we synthesized a novel series of analogs of CDV and cCDV by esterification with two long-chain alkoxyalkanols, 3 -hexadecyloxy- 1 -propanol (HDP-CDV; HDP-cCDV) or 3 -octadecyloxy- 1 -ethanol (ODE-CDV; ODE-cCDV). Their activities were evaluated and compared with those of CDV and cCDV in human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells infected with vaccinia virus (VV) or cowpox virus (CV) using a plaque reduction assay. The 50 % effective concentrations (EC 50 s) against VV in HFF cells for CDV and cCDV were 46. 2 and 50. 6 μM compared with 0. 84 and 3. 8 μM for HDP-CDV and HDP-cCDV, respectively. The EC 50 s for ODE-CDV and ODE-cCDV were 0. 20 and 1. 1 μM, respectively. The HDP analogs were 57 - and 13 -fold more active than the parent nucleotides, whereas the ODE analogs were 231 - and 46 -fold more active than the unmodified CDV and cCDV.
