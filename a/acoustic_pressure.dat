25|$|Acoustic stethoscopes are {{familiar}} to most people, and operate on the transmission of sound from the chest piece, via air-filled hollow tubes, to the listener's ears. The chestpiece usually consists of two sides that can be placed against the patient for sensing sound; a diaphragm (plastic disc) or bell (hollow cup). If the diaphragm {{is placed on the}} patient, body sounds vibrate the diaphragm, creating <b>acoustic</b> <b>pressure</b> waves which travel up the tubing to the listener's ears. If the bell is placed on the patient, the vibrations of the skin directly produce <b>acoustic</b> <b>pressure</b> waves traveling up to the listener's ears. The bell transmits low frequency sounds, while the diaphragm transmits higher frequency sounds. This two-sided stethoscope was invented by Rappaport and Sprague {{in the early part of}} the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{tube length}} determines whether the tube <b>acoustic</b> <b>pressure</b> or {{velocity}} {{is the dominant}} influence on {{the frequency of the}} tube. Simple models of organ pipe resonance is based on open-open pipe resonance (λ=) but corrections must be made to take into account that one end of the pipe radiates into the surrounding medium and the other radiates through a slit with a jet flow. Boelkes and Hoffmann have made measurements of end correction for open-open tubes and derived the relation δ=0.33D. This cannot be exact since the driving end is not open.|$|E
2500|$|Sensitivity {{indicates}} {{how well}} the microphone converts <b>acoustic</b> <b>pressure</b> to output voltage. A high sensitivity microphone creates more voltage and so needs less amplification at the mixer or recording device. [...] This is a practical concern but is not directly {{an indication of the}} microphone's quality, and in fact the term sensitivity is something of a misnomer, [...] "transduction gain" [...] being perhaps more meaningful, (or just [...] "output level") because true sensitivity is generally set by the noise floor, and too much [...] "sensitivity" [...] in terms of output level compromises the clipping level. There are two common measures. The (preferred) international standard is made in millivolts per pascal at 1kHz. A higher value indicates greater sensitivity. The older American method is referred to a 1V/Pa standard and measured in plain decibels, resulting in a negative value. Again, a higher value indicates greater sensitivity, so −60 dB is more sensitive than −70dB.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} {{a series of}} systematic experimental studies to evaluate {{the performance of a}} high-temperature cavitometer under well-controlled conditions. The cavitometer was specifically designed for measurements in liquid metals: it operates through a long tungsten waveguide (probe), providing thermal protection to the piezo sensing elements placed outside the hot area, and with sufficient bandwidth to enable the monitoring of broadband acoustic emissions associated with cavitation activity. It was calibrated electrically, and acoustically, at kHz and MHz frequencies, and so can be used to estimate <b>acoustic</b> <b>pressures</b> (in Pa), providing physical, and consequently practical, meaning to cavitation measurements within liquid metals. Results obtained from ultrasonic sources in a cylindrical vessel using water showed that the cavitometer is a reliable and robust device for characterizing direct field <b>acoustic</b> <b>pressures</b> and broadband emissions from the resulting cavitation. Additionally, preliminary characterization of the real-time <b>acoustic</b> <b>pressures</b> during ultrasonic processing of liquid aluminium (Al) in a standard clay-graphite crucible were performed for the first time. The use of the calibrated cavitometer will establish a more generalized approach for measuring the actual <b>acoustic</b> <b>pressures</b> over a broad range of liquid temperatures within a sonicated medium, demonstrating its potential use as a tool for optimizing, controlling, and scaling-up processes...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) is a {{powerful}} tool for the measurement of forces at the micro/nano scale when calibrated cantilevers are used. Besides many existing calibration techniques, the thermal calibration is one of the simplest and fastest methods for the dynamic characterization of an AFM cantilever. This method is e cient provided that the Brownian motion (thermal noise) is the most important source of excitation during the calibration process. Otherwise, the value of the spring constant is underestimated. This paper investigates noise interference ranges in low sti ness AFM cantilevers taking into account thermal uctuations and <b>acoustic</b> <b>pressures</b> as two main sources of noise. As a result, a preliminary knowledge about the conditions in which thermal uctuations and <b>acoustic</b> <b>pressures</b> have closely the same e ect on the AFM cantilever (noise interference) is provided with both theoretical and experimental arguments. Consequently, beyond the noise interference range, commercial low sti ness AFM cantilevers are calibrated in two ways: using the thermal noise (in a wide temperature range) and <b>acoustic</b> <b>pressures</b> generated by a loudspeaker. We then demonstrate that acoustic noises can also be used for an e cient characterization and calibration of low sti ness AFM cantilevers. The accuracy of the acoustic characterization is evaluated by comparison with results from the thermal calibration...|$|R

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} on both the <b>acoustic</b> and <b>pressure</b> signals produced by bubbles formed from an underwater nozzle.

However, the present study of both <b>acoustic</b> and <b>pressure</b> signals showed that chaos could appear in different regimes and was manifested in different ways in the <b>acoustic</b> and <b>pressure</b> signals. The use of different time delays for the chaotic analysis of <b>acoustic</b> and <b>pressure</b> signals were found necessary.

40|$|A {{comparison}} between phospholipid-coated microbubbles {{with and without}} liposomes attached to the microbubble surface was performed using the ultra-high-speed imaging camera (Brandaris 128).

40|$|The {{application}} of ultrasound to industrial casting processes has attracted research interest {{during the last}} 50 years. However, the transfer and scale-up of this advanced and promising technology to industry has been hindered by difficulties in treating large volumes of liquid metal {{due to the lack}} of understanding of certain fundamentals.

This effect can be exploited to design compact noise control systems with improved acoustic performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a distributed source model to predict fan tone noise levels of an installed turbofan aero-engine is reported. The key objective is to examine a canonical problem: how to predict the pressure field due to a distributed source located near an infinite, rigid cylinder.
