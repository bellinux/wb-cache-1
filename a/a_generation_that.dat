500|$|Coward was no fan of {{the works}} of Gilbert and Sullivan, but as a {{songwriter}} was nevertheless strongly influenced by them.

Noël Coward wrote: [...] "I was born into <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> <b>that</b> still took light music seriously.

500|$|Australia's first celebrity sportsman, Wills {{began to}} fade from public {{consciousness}} within his own lifetime. His dark reputation and suicide, and his links to convictism and frontier violence—sources of cultural cringe—have been posited as reasons for his descent into obscurity. Academic Barry Judd called him [...] "a ghost inhabiting the margins of written history". Coinciding with a revival of interest in Australia's colonial past, Wills has risen [...] "almost to a vogue", and {{is seen as a}} forerunner of today's self-destructive star athletes, some of those qualities that alienated his peers [...] "being less shocking to <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> <b>that</b> likes its heroes flawed". [...] The subject of scholarly, literary and artistic works, his story has been likened to bushranger Ned Kelly's as an epic and quintessentially Australian narrative. After several attempts by different authors since the 1930s, a definitive biography was published in 2008, Greg de Moore's Tom Wills: First Wild Man of Australian Sport.|$|E
500|$|Other critics hailed it as [...] "the British {{answer to}} Thirtysomething"; in 1998, Meg Carter wrote in The Independent, [...] "More than 10 years on, Granada Television has finally {{produced}} a modern show that mines the rich seam of <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> <b>that</b> is as confused {{as it is}} liberated by increased choice and freedom, and that caters for an audience which has not, traditionally, watched very much ITV." [...] Mark Lawson compared it to the American sitcom Friends, a series that is also based around three men and three women, and featured Helen Baxendale in a guest role. In a 2003 interview with Bullen on BBC Radio 4's Front Row, Lawson asked whether Friends had influenced Cold Feet. Bullen explained that the connection was made by media as [...] "a useful shorthand", that he was irritated by the characters in Friends and [...] "would liked to have taken a baseball bat to them".|$|E
500|$|Lyrical themes {{explored}} on The Blackening include love, war, organized religion, {{anger in}} society and Machine Head's [...] "winner take all" [...] spirit. The album's first single, [...] "Aesthetics of Hate", is a retaliation that captures the band's anger towards an article written by William Grim for the conservative web site Iconoclast. Titled [...] "Aesthetics of Hate: R.I.P. Dimebag Abbott, & Good Riddance", the article praised the murder of Dimebag Darrell by Nathan Gale, while Darrell was performing with Damageplan on December 8, 2004. Grim wrote Darrell was [...] "an ignorant, barbaric, untalented possessor of a guitar" [...] who looks [...] "more simian than human" [...] and is [...] "part of <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> <b>that</b> has confused sputum with art and involuntary reflex actions with emotion". After reading the article, Flynn was furious and wrote the song {{to send a message}} to Grim implying [...] "fuck you", and pay tribute to Dimebag.

500|$|In 1965, the {{influence}} of artists such as Bob Dylan, who moved beyond political protest by experimenting with abstract and surreal lyrical imagery, then switched to electric guitar, became increasingly pervasive across the musical landscape, affecting a number of genres, including garage rock. [...] The members of garage bands, like so many musicians of the 1960s, were part of <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> <b>that</b> was largely born into the paradigm and customs of an older time, but grew up confronting {{a new set of}} issues facing a more advanced and technological age. [...] Postwar prosperity brought the advantages of better education, was well as more spare time for recreation, which along with the new technology, made it possible for an increasing number of young people to play music. [...] With the advent of television, nuclear weapons, civil rights, the Cold War, and space exploration, the new generation was more global in its mindset and began to conceive of a higher order of human relations, attempting to reach for a set of transcendent ideals, often expressed through rock music. [...] Though set to a backdrop of tragic events that ultimately proved disillusioning, the various forms of personal and musical experimentation held promise, at least for a time, in the minds of many. [...] While testing the frontiers of what the new world had to offer, 1960s youth ultimately had to accept the limitations of the new reality, yet often did so while experiencing the ecstasy of a moment when the range of possibilities seemed boundless and within reach.|$|E

Peter Watrous of The New York Times commented that, [...] "The communal scene on stage mirrored the feeling in the audience; everybody seemed aware that this was <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> <b>that</b> had rewritten the rules of pop entertainment, and was justifiably proud of its achievement". Brown also performed the song at the 1997 Home Again Tour with New Edition, during the second portion of the show in which he performed hits from his solo career. On November 10, 2005, he performed the song {{for the first time}} in eight years at a concert at House of Blues in Atlantic City. He wore a white suit and matching hat, and sang it as the last song of the evening. On January 17, 2006, he performed it at a New Edition show in Atlantic City's Trump Taj Mahal.

[...] Robert Christgau wrote in The Village Voice, [...] "In case you bought the con, disco never died — just reverted to the crazies who thought it was worth living for. This shamelessly ersatz blonde is one of them, and with the craftily orchestrated help of a fine selection of producers, remixers, and DJs, she's come up with a shamelessly ersatz sound that's tighter than her tummy — essence of electro, the D in DOR." [...] Don Shewey from Rolling Stone was of the opinion that [...] "without overstepping the modest ambitions of minimal funk, Madonna issues an irresistible invitation to the dance." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine rated the album four and a half out of five stars and commented: [...] "Heralding the synth-heavy movement was a debut album [...] that sounds just as fresh today as it did almost two decades ago." [...] In March 2012, the publication placed the album at number 33 on their [...] "Best Albums of the 1980s" [...] list.
