50|$|Rather {{than relying}} on high {{temperature}} and fluid dynamics to <b>accelerate</b> <b>the</b> reaction mass to high speeds, {{there are a variety}} of methods that use electrostatic or electromagnetic forces to <b>accelerate</b> <b>the</b> reaction mass directly. Usually the reaction mass is a stream of ions. Such an engine typically uses electric power, first to ionize atoms, and then to create a voltage gradient to <b>accelerate</b> <b>the</b> ions to high exhaust velocities.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an ecient decentralized multirobot system {{through the use}} of reinforcement learning coupled with heuristics to <b>accelerate</b> <b>the</b> learning process. Our heuristic functions are not reinforcement signals, but are biases to the learning space that help <b>accelerate</b> <b>the</b> exploration process and have no eect on the robot's knowledge. Two kinds of heuristics are used: local and global. The local heuristic is derived from the local knowledge of the robot, whereas the global heuristic is derived from the data obtained from other robots. Both heuristics can help <b>accelerating</b> <b>the</b> learning process...|$|R
50|$|Isinglass finings {{is widely}} used as a {{processing}} aid in the British brewing industry to <b>accelerate</b> <b>the</b> fining, or clarification, of beer. It is used particularly {{in the production of}} cask-conditioned beers, although a few cask ales are available which are not fined using isinglass. The finings flocculate the live yeast in the beer into a jelly-like mass, which settles {{to the bottom of the}} cask. Left undisturbed, beer will clear naturally; the use of isinglass finings <b>accelerates</b> <b>the</b> process. Isinglass is sometimes used with an auxiliary fining, which further <b>accelerates</b> <b>the</b> process of sedimentation.|$|R
5|$|Analysis of Estonian {{oil shale}} {{resources}} and mining possibilities intensified {{during the early}} 20th century while Estonia {{was part of the}} Russian Empire. Industrial development was under way in Saint Petersburg (known as Petrograd in 1914–24), but regional fuel resources were in short supply. A large shale oil extraction plant for processing Estonian oil shale was proposed in 1910. The outbreak of World War I, coupled with a fuel supply crisis, <b>accelerated</b> <b>the</b> pace of the research.|$|E
5|$|Following Malvern's new-found fame as a spa {{and area}} of natural beauty, and fully {{exploiting}} its new rail connections, factories {{from as far}} as Manchester were organising day trips for their employees, often attracting as many as 5,000visitors a day. In 1865, a public meeting of residents denounced the rising rail fares– by then twice that of other lines– that were exploiting the tourism industry, and demanded a limitation {{to the number of}} excursion trains. The arrival of the railway also enabled the delivery of coal in large quantities, which <b>accelerated</b> <b>the</b> area's popularity as a winter resort.|$|E

5|$|Historian of Indonesia M. C. Ricklefs {{argued that}} the VOC victory in Surabaya {{probably}} <b>accelerated</b> <b>the</b> fall of Mataram. The defeated rebel forces retreated inland, driving closer to Mataram's capital and triggering an early attack on the court. Secondly, the alliance between the king and the foreign, Christian VOC strengthened the Islamic character of the rebellion. Amangkurat I's successor, Amangkurat II, later told the VOC that the alliance with the VOC pushed his cousin Pangeran Purbaya towards the rebel side, and Purbaya's forces were among those who later overran the capital.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, after Galveston {{was struck}} by a devastating hurricane, efforts to make Houston into a viable deep-water port were <b>accelerated.</b> <b>The</b> {{following}} year, the discovery of oil at the Spindletop oil field near Beaumont prompted the development of the Texas petroleum industry. In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt approved a $1-million improvement project for the Houston Ship Channel. By 1910, the city's population had reached 78,800, almost doubling from a decade before. African Americans formed {{a large part of the}} city's population, numbering 23,929 people, which was nearly one-third of the residents.|$|E

The restaurants were re-branded with a distinctive red-and-white striped color pattern and mansard roofs with cupolas. The roll-out of freestanding stores <b>accelerated</b> <b>the</b> company's growth as outlets exclusively selling fried chicken proved to be more appealing to potential franchisees.|$|E

Comet C/1980 E1 had an orbital period of roughly 7.1 million years before the 1982 perihelion passage, but a 1980 encounter with Jupiter <b>accelerated</b> <b>the</b> comet giving it the largest eccentricity (1.057) of any known hyperbolic comet. Comets not expected to return to the inner Solar System include C/1980 E1, C/2000 U5, C/2001 Q4 (NEAT), C/2009 R1, C/1956 R1, and C/2007 F1 (LONEOS).|$|E
5|$|On March 8, 2013, the {{engineering}} firm NORR, {{commissioned by the}} Ontario Provincial Police, released {{the results of their}} forensic engineering investigation to the Elliot Lake Inquiry. The investigation found that the collapse was caused by a two-stage failure of the welding on a connection, due to extensive corrosion. The corrosion was caused by improper waterproofing and the placement of a parking lot on the roof, which allowed water, contaminated with road salt (which <b>accelerated</b> <b>the</b> corrosion) to corrode the structure.|$|E
5|$|Palaeobotanists study ancient {{plants in}} the fossil record to provide {{information}} about the evolutionary history of plants. Cyanobacteria, the first oxygen-releasing photosynthetic organisms on Earth, are thought to have given rise to the ancestor of plants by entering into an endosymbiotic relationship with an early eukaryote, ultimately becoming the chloroplasts in plant cells. The new photosynthetic plants (along with their algal relatives) <b>accelerated</b> <b>the</b> rise in atmospheric oxygen started by the cyanobacteria, changing the ancient oxygen-free, reducing, atmosphere to one in which free oxygen has been abundant for more than 2 billion years.|$|E

Further evolution was slow, and for about 3 billion years in the Precambrian eon, (much {{of the history of}} life on Earth), all organisms were microorganisms. Bacteria, algae and fungi have been identified in amber that is 220 million years old, which shows that the morphology of microorganisms has changed little since the Triassic period.

5|$|The ensuing {{worldwide}} plant reduction {{resulting from}} the difficulties plants encountered in adjusting to the new climate caused a progressive fragmentation and collapse of rainforest ecosystems. This reinforced and so further <b>accelerated</b> <b>the</b> collapse by sharply {{reducing the amount of}} animal life which could be supported by the shrinking ecosystems at that time. The outcome of this animal reduction was a crash in global carbon dioxide levels, which impacted the plants even more. The aridity and temperature drop which resulted from this runaway plant reduction and decrease in a primary greenhouse gas caused the Earth to rapidly enter a series of intense Ice Ages.|$|E
