500|$|Longworth {{notes that}} the {{dramatic}} success of Out of Africa led to a backlash of critical opinion against Streep {{in the years that}} followed, especially as she was now demanding $4million a picture. Unlike other stars at the time such as Sylvester Stallone and Tom Cruise, Streep [...] "never seemed to play herself", and certain critics felt her technical finesse led people to literally see her acting. Her next films did not appeal to a wide audience; she co-starred with Jack Nicholson in the dramas Heartburn (1986) and Ironweed (1987), in which she sang onscreen {{for the first time since}} the television movie Secret Service (1977). In Evil Angels (1988), she played Lindy Chamberlain, an Australian woman who had been convicted of the murder of her infant daughter despite claiming that the baby had been taken by a dingo. Filmed in Australia, Streep won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, a Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival, and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress. Streep has said of perfecting the Australian accent in the film: [...] "I had to study <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>for</b> Australian because it's not dissimilar , so it's like coming from Italian to Spanish. You get a little mixed up". Vincent Canby of The New York Times referred to her performance as [...] "another stunning performance", played with [...] "the kind of virtuosity that seems to redefine the possibilities of screen acting".|$|E
2500|$|The band {{released}} a cover album titled [...] on August 30. The release featured covers of songs originally by The Rolling Stones, Bad Company, Led Zeppelin, AC/DC and others. According to original bassist Sean Sammon, it was {{confirmed that the}} band's first two albums, [...] "Stuck" [...] and [...] "Abrasive", would be re-released sometime in late 2011. Ardito rejoined the band in 2011 and proceeded to tour with them. Ryan Yerdon was also replaced by Shannon Boone. The band posted several online updates during 2012 suggesting that they were writing and recording a new album. Wes Scantlin was interviewed about his latest arrest for vandalism on July 2013, where he was quoted as saying [...] "We have tons and tons of new hit songs. I write every single night, and we record all the time. We're getting ready to go in and do the record, tour <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>for</b> the summer, and then do the full production and get back on the scene." ...|$|E
2500|$|The two new {{tracks were}} {{produced}} by Brandon Friesen, {{who has also}} been overseeing sessions for the band's next studio album. Consisting of songs written by Pritchard while the other band members spent time with their families, the new album is deemed {{to be more of}} a band effort, as opposed to Listen which was constructed individually. [...] "This one’s very much 'us' – all rehearsing songs, all arranging songs, all playing together. It’s got the same sort of energy that we had on our first couple of albums, which we were probably running away from <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>for</b> a while, but now we’ve gone back to it," [...] said Pritchard. [...] "Brandon Friesen, our producer, has taken more of a production role than me, so I won’t be taking the credit. On Listen, me and Inflo worked together everyday. But this one’s been much more of a band record. It’s been far more collaborative." ...|$|E

2500|$|In May 2012, ABC {{president}} Paul Lee {{said the}} network had {{passed on the}} series. Later that year, Rosenberg was shopping the show around to other networks, saying [...] "I don’t know if it’s an ABC show. It might be a cable show, really. The [...] graphic novel {{is the first one}} that Marvel did that was meant to serve an adult audience. I toned it down <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>for</b> network, but it’s very, very easy to translate that into cable. Very easy." [...] In October 2013, Deadline reported that Marvel was preparing four drama series and a miniseries, totaling 60 episodes, to present to video on demand services and cable providers, with Netflix, Amazon, and WGN America expressing interest. A few weeks later, Marvel and Disney announced that Marvel Television and ABC Studios would provide Netflix with live action series centered around Jessica Jones, Daredevil, Iron Fist, and Luke Cage, leading up to a miniseries based on the Defenders. Rosenberg was brought on to write and produce the new incarnation of the series, to be reconfigured from her original project, which she called a [...] "page one do-over" [...] from her original vision. Liz Friedman also serves as an executive producer on the series during the first season. In December 2014, the official title was revealed to be Marvel's A.K.A. Jessica Jones. However, in June 2015, Marvel revealed that the title for the series would be shortened to Marvel's Jessica Jones. On why the title was shortened, Loeb said, [...] "It literally just became {{one of those things that}} happens. We had talked about whether that was the best title for it, and that’s how it happened." [...] Rosenberg added that the [...] "AKA" [...] is [...] "living in the episodes. You'll still see it." ...|$|E

I could see she thought I really meant to insult her. Of course, I explained it was only what I'd have done to any nice girl at home under similar circumstances; but she didn't seem to believe me. And the oddest part of it all was, that all the time we were dancing I had my arm round her waist, as all the other men had theirs round their partners; and at home we consider it a much greater proof of confidence and affection to be allowed to place your arm round a lady's waist than merely to kiss her." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{the realms}} of finance, the glass ceiling can be seen through trends, new CEOs, and stock performance. Looking at trends {{in the number of}} female and male CEOs, one can find a steady {{increase}} in female CEOs from 1992 to 2004. In 2002, this increased tapered off <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit.</b> <b>For</b> male CEOs, they have increased from 1992 to 1999, and since then male CEOs have decreased. An interesting observation from this chart will reveal that when the female increase in CEOs tapered starting in 2002, the male CEOs continued to decline. This brings insight into the United States economic state in the year 2002. Coincidentally, there was a recession in the U.S. in 2002 through 2003.|$|E
50|$|The HD network {{makes use}} of {{inertial}} and other movement-related inputs, and thus continues to operate {{even in the absence}} of light. These inertial properties are dependent on the vestibular system, especially the semicircular canals of the inner ear, which signal rotations of the head. The HD system integrates the vestibular output to maintain a signal reflecting cumulative rotation. The integration is less than perfect, though, especially for slow head rotations. If an animal is placed on an isolated platform and slowly rotated in the dark, the alignment of the HD system usually shifts <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>for</b> each rotation. If an animal explores a dark environment with no directional cues, the HD alignment tends to drift slowly and randomly over time.|$|E
