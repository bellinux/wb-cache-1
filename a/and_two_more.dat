5|$|William Morris was a {{prolific}} writer of poetry, fiction, essays, and translations of ancient and medieval texts. His first poems were published {{when he was}} 24 years old, and he was polishing his final novel, The Sundering Flood, {{at the time of}} his death.

5|$|A second woodcut was {{executed}} by Hans Burgkmair in Augsburg {{around the same}} time as Dürer's in Nuremberg. Burgkmair corresponded with merchants in Lisbon and Nuremberg, {{but it is not clear}} whether he had access to a letter or sketch as Dürer did, perhaps even Dürer's sources, or saw the animal himself in Portugal. His image is truer to life, omitting Dürer's more fanciful additions and including the shackles and chain used to restrain the rhinoceros; however, Dürer's woodcut is more powerful and eclipsed Burgkmair's in popularity. Only one impression (example) of Burgkmair's image has survived, whereas Dürer's print survives in many impressions. Dürer produced a first edition of his woodcut in 1515, in the first state, which is distinguished by only five lines of text in the heading. Many further printings followed after Dürer's death in 1528, including two in the 1540s, <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>more</b> in the late 16th century. Later printings have six lines of descriptive text.|$|E

Three players were taken in the second round, Winston Justice by Philadelphia, Taitusi Lutui by Arizona, and LenDale White by Tennessee, <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>more</b> were taken in the third round, Frostee Rucker to Cincinnati and Dominique Byrd by St. Louis to end {{the first day of}} the draft.

5|$|Afterwards, {{the ship}} {{returned}} to the UK to ferry 801 Squadron to Gibraltar and delivered the unit on 7 June. Together with Eagle, Argus was tasked to provide air cover over Force H as it covered a convoy attempting to get desperately needed supplies through to Malta later in June (Operation Harpoon). The carrier embarked two Fulmars from 807 Squadron, nine Swordfish from 813 Squadron and four more Swordfish from 824 Squadron to protect the convoy from submarines while Eagle loaded 20 Fulmars and Sea Hurricanes from three different squadrons. One Swordfish crashed while landing on 13 June and the wreckage was pushed over the side. Both Fulmars from 807 Squadron were shot down on 14 June by Italian bombers, but they likely shot down one Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 and one CANT Z.1007 bomber. Eagle transferred her Fulmars to Argus {{over the course of}} the battle <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>more</b> were lost later in the day. The ship was attacked multiple times by bombs and torpedoes during the battle without effect.|$|E
5|$|Aladdin, {{released}} in November 1992, continued the upward trend in Disney's animation success, earning $504 million worldwide {{at the box}} office, <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>more</b> Oscars for Best Song and Best Score. Featuring songs by Menken, Ashman, and Tim Rice (who replaced Ashman after his passing) and starring the voice of Robin Williams, Aladdin also established the trend of hiring celebrity actors and actresses to provide the voices of Disney characters, which had been explored to some degree with The Jungle Book and Oliver & Company, but now became standard practice.|$|E
5|$|As discussed, the Chalkidian League {{had made}} peace with Athens in 352 BC, in clear breach of their {{alliance}} with Philip, due to their growing fear of Macedonian power. Cawkwell contends that from that moment on, Olynthos and the League were doomed. However, {{the next few years}} of Philip's reign appear to have been militarily quiet; Diodorus does not mention any activity by Philip until 349 BC. Philip did not yet make any further efforts to intervene in the Sacred War, which was to rumble on until 346 BC. In the meantime, there may have been some unrest in Macedonia; Philip executed one of his stepbrothers (sons of Amyntas III's second wife), <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>more</b> fled to Olynthos. According to Justin, this provided Philip with the pretext of attacking Olynthos and the Chalkidian League.|$|E
