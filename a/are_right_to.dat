These missions are flown at the WC-130's service ceiling of , which subjects them to turbulence, lightning and icing. The crews collect data ahead of weather systems, dropping weather buoys along their routes, before they move off the eastern seaboard to help determine if the conditions <b>are</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> intensify into Nor'easter blizzards. In 1997 and 1998, the Hurricane Hunters also flew winter storms in the Gulf of Alaska. The predetermined tracks are six to eleven hours in duration, with one to three missions flown per major winter storm event. Coverage of winter storms in the eastern Pacific has become standard during the month of February, operating TDY from either Elmendorf AFB, Alaska, or Hickam AFB, Hawaii.|$|E
500|$|Goodman sees {{schools as}} {{mechanisms}} for adjusting youth to an automated society increasingly absent [...] "any human values". Goodman disagrees {{with those who}} say public schools teach middle class values, as he sees schools as more petit bourgeois than bourgeois, favoring [...] "bureaucratic, time-serving, grade-grind-practical, timid, and nouveau riche climbing" [...] over [...] "independence, initiative, scrupulous honesty, earnestness, utility, [...] respect for thorough scholarship". In this way, schooling {{is not a good}} use of student time, and students <b>are</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> quit and avoid the psychological and professional damage. More important is the disintegration of social class segregation. Goodman then asserts that lower- and middle-class kids would be better off without public or any schooling altogether. He proposes several alternatives to formal schooling, such as divvying up the high school's public funds directly amongst its students, and advocates for a variety of experimental school alternatives: [...] "no school at all, the real city as school, farm schools, practical apprenticeships, guided travel, work camps, little theaters and local newspapers, [...] community service". Other proposals include making class non-compulsory (such that attendance will reflect student interest without [...] "trapping" [...] children), requiring students to wait two years before applying to the most elite colleges, eliminating grades so the burden of testing for required skills falls on companies, and letting students quit and resume freely. He proposes Danish folk school-style education for those uninterested in academics. Goodman's foremost intention was to stimulate new educational paradigms. He acknowledges that his specific proposals may be unpopular or ignored.|$|E

This was challenged, for historical reasons, by Wisden in 1983 and the current situation re this controversy is that both sides generally accept each other's views. For example, Rae {{points out that the}} statisticians <b>are</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> criticise Victorian compilers for [...] "including minor matches to enable Grace to reach certain milestones"; but he also respects the view of Grace's contemporaries that [...] "any match in which he played was elevated in status by his very presence".|$|E
2500|$|In 1999 Schäuble {{initiated}} a CDU/CSU petition {{campaign against the}} reform of German citizenship law under the slogan [...] "Integration: yes— double citizenship: no". In response to anti-immigrant rallies in the eastern city of Dresden in late 2014, Schäuble said that immigration is good for Germany and politicians must explain better that everyone stands to gain from it; at the time, the number of asylum seekers in Germany, many from Syria, had more than doubled within a year to around 200,000, and net immigration was at its highest level in two decades. [...] "Just as we used millions of refugees and expellees after World War Two to rebuild.. so we need immigration today," [...] Schäuble told Bild {{when asked about the}} popularity of anti-immigration policies. Also, he held that [...] "people <b>are</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> fear Islamist terrorism. But not Islam." [...] In September 2015, he urged the Member States of the European Union to quickly establish a common European asylum law.|$|E
2500|$|The new Foreign Minister Rafael Roncagliolo met his Chilean {{counterpart}} Alfredo Moreno Charme {{prior to}} taking office. Following the meeting {{he said that}} Moreno was [...] "a concerned person, who has an attitude of dialogue and does not encourage unnecessary antagonism" [...] and added that {{in regards to the}} Chilean–Peruvian maritime dispute [...] "by going to the Hague, what we are looking for is peaceful understanding, avoid lawsuits and verbal arguments. Peru has taken the position of a modern civilized nation to go to court. Resolve conflicts by means of right reason, not force." [...] However he also commented on Chilean military spending vis-a-vis its neighbours: [...] "When a country develops a quite disproportionate military capacity compared to their neighbours, others <b>are</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> worry. That is the situation we face. Yes, we should worry. Chile's military spending is disproportionate to the neighbours. That is why Peru, in UNASUR is promoting transparency and a reduction of military spending. There are more important things you must invest in Latin America. All countries must have a credible military defense, and Peru has not maintained one like this." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{his book}} [...] "Wrestling with Zion," [...] {{he urged the}} Jews [...] "not to provoke the anger of the native people by doing them wrong...we should be {{cautious}} in our dealings with a foreign people among whom we returned to live, to handle these people with love and respect and, needless to say, with justice and good judgment. [...] And what do our brothers do? [...] Exactly the opposite! [...] They were slaves in their Diasporas, and suddenly they find themselves with unlimited freedom, wild freedom that only a country like Turkey [...] can offer. [...] This sudden change has planted despotic tendencies in their hearts, as always happens to former slaves [...] [...] They deal with the Arabs with hostility and cruelty, trespass unjustly, beat them shamefully for no sufficient reason, and even boast about their actions. [...] There is no one to stop the flood {{and put an end}} to this despicable and dangerous tendency. [...] Our brothers indeed were right when they said that the Arab only respects he who exhibits bravery and courage. [...] But when these people feel that the law is on their rival's side and, even more so, if they <b>are</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> think their rival's actions are unjust and oppressive, then, even if they are silent and endlessly reserved, they keep their anger in their hearts.

2500|$|The Shakespearean critic A.C. Bradley {{was more}} ambivalent. Though agreeing that we <b>are</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> [...] "turn with disgust from Tate's sentimental adaptations, from his {{marriage}} of Edgar and Cordelia, {{and from that}} cheap moral which every one of Shakespeare's tragedies contradicts, 'that Truth and Virtue shall at last succeed'", yet he [...] "venture to doubt" [...] that [...] "Tate and Dr. Johnson [...] altogether in the wrong". Sharing Johnson's view that the tragic ending was too harsh, too shocking, Bradley observed that [...] King Lear, while frequently described as Shakespeare's greatest work, {{the best of his}} plays, was yet less popular than Hamlet, Macbeth, and Othello; that the general reader, though acknowledging its greatness, would also speak of it with a certain distaste; and that it was the least often presented on stage, as well as being the least successful there. Bradley suggested that the feeling which prompted Tate's alteration and which allowed it to replace Shakespeare on stage for over a century was a general wish that Lear and Cordelia might escape their doom. Distinguishing between the philanthropic sense, which also wishes other tragic figures to be saved, and the dramatic sense, which does not, but which still wishes to spare Lear and Cordelia, he suggested that the emotions have already been sufficiently stirred before their deaths, and he believed that Shakespeare would have given Lear [...] "peace and happiness by Cordelia's fireside", had he taken the subject in hand a few years later, {{at the time that he}} was writing Cymbeline and The Winter's Tale. Agreeing with Lamb that the agony that Lear has undergone makes [...] "a fair dismissal from the stage of life the only decorous thing for him", Bradley argues that [...] "it is precisely this fair dismissal which we desire for him", not the renewed anguish which Shakespeare inflicts on him with the death of Cordelia.|$|E
