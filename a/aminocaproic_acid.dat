25|$|Refractory corneal ulcers {{can take}} a long time to heal, {{sometimes}} months. Topical antibiotics are used continually to prevent infection. Pain medications are given as needed. Loose epithelium is removed with a dry cotton swab under topical anesthesia. This is in order to allow production of normal basement membrane and division of normal epithelium. Often further treatment is necessary, such as a keratotomy, which is superficial cutting or piercing of the cornea. There are two main types used in dogs: multiple punctate keratotomy (MPK) and grid keratotomy (GK). MPK involves making small superficial punctures into the cornea with a needle. GK is more commonly used and involves making parallel and perpendicular scratches in the corneal surface. Usually only topical anesthesia is necessary. By scoring the corneal surface, anchoring points are provided for attachment of new epithelium. Of course, these procedures should only be performed by a veterinarian, particularly one with some experience in this treatment. Complete healing takes about three to four weeks. Keratotomies may lead to corneal sequestration in cats. Other medications have been shown to be useful in topical treatment of refractory ulcers, including glycosaminoglycans such as sodium hyaluronate and chondroitin sulfate, <b>aminocaproic</b> <b>acid,</b> and acetylcysteine.|$|E

Jako amfifilní látky byly zvoleny bazická aminokyselina lysin a její analog 6 - aminokapronová kyselina. Přítomnost karboxylové skupiny na HA a aminoskupiny aminokyselin předpokládá elektrostatické interakce mezi těmito látkami. Tento předpoklad vede k možnosti fyzikálně modifikovat HA a následně ho použít jako nový typ nosiče biologicky aktivních látek, např. léčiv. Pro studium interakcí byly vybrány HA o molekulové hmotnosti 1, 75 MDa a 70 kDa, které se mísily s aminokyselinami v různých objemových poměrech. Měření bylo prováděno ve třech prostředích, a to v čisté vodě, 0, 15 M roztoku chloridu sodného, a ve fosfátovém pufru (PBS) o pH 6. Na studium interakcí byla použita reologie. Výsledky naznačují, že dochází k interakcím mezi HA a aminokyselinami, zvláště pak u systému 1, 75 MDa HA a lysinu ve vodě. Interakce mezi HA a aminokyselinami se projevily snížením viskozity směsi.

5000|$|Because the R {{value on}} the TEG {{represents}} {{the time it takes}} for clot formation to start, it is a reflection of coagulation factor activity. Coagulation factors are essentially enzymes that drive clot formation. Thus, a prolonged R time should be treated with plasma. The alpha angle represents the thrombin burst and conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Thus, a depressed alpha angle should be treated with either cryoprecipitate or large volumes of plasma. 80% of the MA is derived from platelet function whereas the remaining 20% is derived from fibrin. Thus, a depressed MA is better treated with platelet transfusion or medications that improve platelet function, such as DDAVP.

There is paucity of data in the literature about other potentially useful agents, such as <b>aminocaproic</b> <b>acid</b> (Amicar) in the post-transplantation setting. We retrospectively reviewed our data on 115 consecutive patients who underwent HSCT and had pulmonary complications, {{with the aim of}} determining the overall clinical outcome in recipients of allogeneic transplants and in the subgroup of these patients who were treated with concomitant Solu-Medrol and <b>aminocaproic</b> <b>acid.</b> <b>Aminocaproic</b> <b>acid</b> was added at the discretion of the attending physician. We identified 14 allogeneic transplant recipients (median age, 41 years) with 15 episodes of DAH who were treated with Solu-Medrol (250 mg to 1 g intravenously per day). Of these, 8 patients also received concomitant <b>aminocaproic</b> <b>acid</b> at 1000 mg intravenously every 6 hours. Failure to improve was the most common reason for adding <b>aminocaproic</b> <b>acid.</b> The incidence of DAH was 12. 2 % (10. 3 % in myeloablative versus 1. 9 % in nonmyeloablative recipients). The overall 100 -day DAH mortality and median transplantation survival were 60 % and 99 days, respectively. Among the subset of patients treated with the combination of Solu-Medrol and <b>aminocaproic</b> <b>acid,</b> we observed a 100 -day DAH mortality and median transplantation survival of 44 % and 167 days, respectively, compared with 83 % and 96. 5 days in those treated with Solu-Medrol alone.

Three hundred thirty-five patients who underwent primary cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass between November 1, 2003, and December 31, 2005, and were considered at low risk for requiring postoperative blood transfusion; 162 patients received aprotinin and 173 patients received <b>aminocaproic</b> <b>acid</b> (control). Measurements and Main Results. Comparison of patients in the aprotinin group versus those in the <b>aminocaproic</b> <b>acid</b> group revealed no difference in total donor exposures to blood products (1. 86 vs 1. 16 units/patient, p= 0. 07), total {{packed red blood cells}} (PRBCs) received (1. 25 vs 0. 86 units/patient, p= 0. 09), postoperative donor exposures to blood products (0. 91 vs 0. 48 unit/patient, p= 0. 13), or postoperative PRBCs received (0. 61 vs 0. 40 unit/patient, p= 0. 23). No difference was noted in any other clinical outcome in the aprotinin group versus the <b>aminocaproic</b> <b>acid</b> group, including postoperative azotemia (13. 0 % vs 10. 4 %, p= 0. 46), new onset of atrial fibrillation (14. 8 % vs 15. 0 %, p= 0. 95), myocardial infarction, stroke, or death.

The goal {{of this study was to}} compare incidence of reopening following open heart surgeries in patients who were administered either epsilon amino caproic acid or tranexamic acid for control of perioperative bleeding. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, controlled trial was performed among seventy-eight patients of either sex in the age group of 18 to 65 years scheduled for open heart surgeries under cardiopulmonary bypass. They were randomly allocated into three groups where group A (n= 26) received epsilon <b>aminocaproic</b> <b>acid,</b> group B (n= 26) received tranexamic acid and group C (control group, n= 26) received intravenous 0. 9 % normal saline.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Acquired factor VIII {{deficiency}} {{is a rare}} {{entity that}} can lead to severe and life-threatening bleeding. We describe a case of severe bleeding from the tongue secondary to acquired hemophilia and discuss treatment options, including <b>aminocaproic</b> <b>acid</b> and recombinant factor VIII, which have not been widely reported in the literature for the management of such patients. Case presentation A 94 -year-old Caucasian man presented to our institution with diffuse bruising and extensive bleeding from the tongue secondary to mechanical trauma. He had no prior history of bleeding and his medical history was unremarkable except for dementia and hypertension. Coagulation studies revealed a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and a mixing study was consistent with the presence of an inhibitor. Quantitative assays revealed a reduced level of factor VIII activity (1 %) and the presence of a factor VIII inhibitor, measured at seven Bethesda units, in the serum. Oral prednisone therapy (60 mg/day) was given. He also received intravenous <b>aminocaproic</b> <b>acid</b> and human concentrate of factor VIII (Humate-P) and topical anti-thrombolytic agents (100 units of topical thrombin cream). His hospital course was prolonged because of persistent bleeding and the development of profuse melena. He required eight units of packed red blood cells for transfusion. Hospitalization was also complicated by bradycardia of unclear etiology, which started after infusion of <b>aminocaproic</b> <b>acid.</b> His activated partial thromboplastin time gradually normalized. He was discharged to a rehabilitation facility three weeks later with improving symptoms, stable hematocrit and resolving bruises. Conclusions Clinicians should suspect a diagnosis of acquired hemophilia in older patients with unexplained persistent and profound bleeding from uncommon soft tissues, including the tongue. Use of factor VIII (Humate-P) and <b>aminocaproic</b> <b>acid</b> can be useful in this coagulopathy but clinicians should be aware of possible life-threatening side effects in older patients, including bradycardia. </p...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Aprotinin {{reduces the}} blood loss and {{transfusion}} of blood products in children undergoing major surgery. Aprotinin {{has been associated with}} severe side effects in adults, and tranexamic acid and <b>aminocaproic</b> <b>acid</b> {{have been found to be}} safer alternatives in adults. This systematic review addresses the question of whether tranexamic acid and <b>aminocaproic</b> <b>acid</b> are equally effective as aprotinin for reducing blood loss and transfusion in children undergoing major surgery. Data Sources. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify all randomized controlled trials of aprotinin, tranexamic acid, and <b>aminocaproic</b> <b>acid</b> involving children undergoing cardiac or scoliosis surgery. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Twenty-three cardiac studies, totaling 1893 patients, met the inclusion criteria. None of the studies directly compared aprotinin to an alternative antifibrinolytic. Five scoliosis studies, totaling 207 patients, met the inclusion criteria. Data on blood loss and use of blood products in the first 24 postoperative hours were extracted. Only homogenously distributed outcomes were pooled. Data Synthesis: Tranexamic acid showed a homogeneously distributed reduction of blood loss by 11 mL/kg (95 % confidence interval [Cl] 9 - 13 mL/kg). Outcomes of blood loss reduction by aprotinin and <b>aminocaproic</b> <b>acid</b> were too heterogeneously distributed to be pooled, so the effect on blood loss could not be evaluated. Both aprotinin and tranexamic acid significantly reduced packed red cell transfusion (4 mL/kg, 95 % CI 2 - 7 mL/kg and 7 mL/kg, 95 % CI 5 - 10 mL/kg, respectively). Type of antifibrinolytic was not a determining factor that explained differences in outcome among trials in a meta-regression analysis. In the scoliosis studies, aprotinin and tranexamic acid significantly reduced blood loss compared with placebo (385 mL, 95 % CI 727 - 42 mL and 682 mL, 95 % CI 1149 - 214 mL, respectively). Conclusions: There is no evidence that suggests that, compared with aprotinin, alternative antifibrinolytics such as tranexamic acid were less effective in reducing blood loss in major pediatric surgery.

40|$|Background: Because {{of recent}} {{concerns}} {{about the safety of}} aprotinin, we updated our 2007 Cochrane review that compared the relative benefits and risks of aprotinin and the lysine analogues tranexamic acid and epsilon <b>aminocaproic</b> <b>acid.</b> Methods: We searched electronic databases, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google and Google Scholar for trials of antifibrinolytic drugs used in adults scheduled for cardiac surgery. Searches were updated to January 2008. By comparing aprotinin and the 2 lysine analogues to control, we derived indirect head-to-head comparisons of aprotinin to the other drugs. We derived direct estimates of risks and benefits by pooling estimates from head-to-head trials of aprotinin and tranexamic acid or epsilon <b>aminocaproic</b> <b>acid.</b> Results: For indirect estimates, we identified 49 trials involving 182 deaths among 7439 participants. The summary relative risk (RR) for death with aprotinin versus placebo was 0. 93 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 69 – 1. 25). In the 19 trials that included tranexamic acid, there were 24 deaths among 1802 participants. The summary RR was 0. 55 (95 % CI 0. 24 – 1. 25). From the risk estimates derived for individual drugs, we calculated an indirect summary RR of death with use of aprotinin versus tranexamic acid of 1. 69 (95 % CI 0. 70 – 4. 10). To calculate direct estimates of death for aprotinin versus tranexamic acid, we identified 13 trials with 107 deaths among 3537 participants. The summary RR was 1. 43 (95 % CI 0. 98 – 2. 08). Among the 1840 participants, the calculated estimates of death for aprotinin compared directly to epsilon <b>aminocaproic</b> <b>acid</b> was 1. 49 (95 % CI 0. 98 – 2. 28). We found no evidence of an increased risk of myocardial infarction with use of aprotinin compared with the lysine analogues in either direct or indirect analyses. Compared with placebo or no treatment, all 3 drugs were effective in reducing the need for red blood cell transfusion. The RR of transfusion with use of aprotinin was 0. 66 (95 % CI 0. 61 – 0. 72). The RR of transfusion was 0. 70 (95 % CI 0. 61 – 0. 80) for tranexamic acid, and it was 0. 75 (95 % CI 0. 58 – 0. 96) for use of epsilon <b>aminocaproic</b> <b>acid.</b> Aprotinin was also effective in reducing the need for re-operation because of bleeding (RR 0. 48, 95 % CI 0. 34 – 0. 67). Interpretation: The risk of death tended to be consistently higher with use of aprotinin than with use of lysine analogues. Aprotinin had no clear advantages to offset these harms. Either tranexamic acid or epsilon <b>aminocaproic</b> <b>acid</b> should be recommended to prevent bleeding after cardiac surgery...|$|E
