5|$|A second church, also {{dedicated}} to St Michael, was built of local sandstone in the 14th century by the Abbot Adam of Sodbury, incorporating {{the foundations of}} the previous building. It included stained glass and decorated floor tiles. There was also <b>a</b> <b>portable</b> altar of Purbeck Marble; {{it is likely that the}} Monastery of St Michael on the Tor was a daughter house of Glastonbury Abbey. In 1243 Henry III granted a charter for a six-day fair at the site.|$|E

5|$|Do-Ashiayana Manzil was <b>a</b> <b>portable</b> wooden house {{used by the}} Mughal {{emperors}} {{during their}} visits outside their capital. This was a double storied house built with a platform supported over 16 pillars, of 6 yards height. Pillars were 4 cubits in height joined with nuts and bolts which formed the upper floor. This functioned as a sleeping quarter for the king and also for worship and holding Jharokha Darshan, and considered it an emulation of Hindu practice.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Kerst took a {{leave of}} absence from the University of Illinois to work on the {{development}} of the betatron with the engineering staff at General Electric in 1940 and 1941. They designed 20 MeV and 100 MeV versions of the betatron, and he supervised the construction of the former, which he brought back to the University of Illinois with him. He also designed <b>a</b> <b>portable</b> 4 MeV betatron for inspecting dud bombs.|$|E
5|$|Hammond {{introduced}} {{their first}} integrated circuit (IC) model, the Concorde, in 1971. The company had stopped manufacturing tonewheel organs entirely by 1975, {{due to increased}} financial inefficiency, and switched to making IC models full-time. Console models included the 8000 Aurora (1976) and 8000M Aurora (1977), which contained drawbars and a built-in rotating speaker. Spinet organs included the Romance series, manufactured between 1977 and 1983. In 1979, a Japanese offshoot, Nihon Hammond, introduced the X-5, <b>a</b> <b>portable</b> solid-state clone of the B-3.|$|E

5|$|Hard {{suction hose}} {{can also be}} used to extend the range of a water tender's dumping capability, if the {{fittings}} of the hard suction hose match those of the tender dumping water. This could be used to fill <b>a</b> <b>portable</b> dump tank not immediately adjacent to the water tender, from which another fire engine can draft. Since water movement during dumping relies on gravity, rather than mechanical pressurization, hard suction hose is useful for this task.|$|E

5|$|The castle was {{probably}} built for John Harington, 1st Baron Harington (b. 1281â€“d. 1347). Gleaston Castle is first mentioned in 1389, although John Harington, 2nd Baron Harington {{is said to}} have died there in 1363. In 1415 John Harington was granted a papal indult for a private chapel and <b>a</b> <b>portable</b> altar for mass. It is likely, however, that the castle would have had its own chapel before this date.|$|E
5|$|There are {{thousands}} of uses of various potassium compounds. One example is potassium superoxide, , an orange solid that acts as <b>a</b> <b>portable</b> source of oxygen and a carbon dioxide absorber. It is widely used in respiration systems in mines, submarines and spacecraft as it takes less volume than the gaseous oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Thorium was {{discovered}} in 1828; its first application came in 1885, when Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach invented the gas mantle, <b>a</b> <b>portable</b> source of light which produces light from the incandescence of thorium oxide when heated by burning gaseous fuels. After that, many applications were found for thorium and its compounds, including ceramics, carbon arc lamps, heat-resistant crucibles, and as catalysts for industrial chemical reactions such as the oxidation of ammonia to nitric acid.|$|E

5|$|Americium-241 {{has been}} used as <b>a</b> <b>portable</b> source of both gamma rays and alpha {{particles}} for a number of medical and industrial uses. The 59.5409keV gamma ray emissions from 241Am in such sources can be used for indirect analysis of materials in radiography and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, as well as for quality control in fixed nuclear density gauges and nuclear densometers. For example, the element has been employed to gauge glass thickness to help create flat glass. Americium-241 is also suitable for calibration of gamma-ray spectrometers in the low-energy range, since its spectrum consists of nearly a single peak and negligible Compton continuum (at least three orders of magnitude lower intensity). Americium-241 gamma rays were also used to provide passive diagnosis of thyroid function. This medical application is however obsolete.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{model for}} the iconography of Saint Jovan Vladimir is an engraving in the 1690 edition of the Greek akolouthia. It is a work by Venetian engraver Isabella Piccini. She depicted the saint with a mustache and short beard, wearing a cloak and a crown inscribed with lilies, holding a cross in his right hand, and his severed head in his left hand. <b>A</b> <b>portable</b> icon in Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula, dated around 1700, shows the saint mounted on horseback.|$|E
