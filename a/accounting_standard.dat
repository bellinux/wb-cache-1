I posit that mandatory IFRS adoption lowers the systemic information noise embedded in countries' <b>accounting</b> <b>standards.</b> This reduces the associated information processing costs and enhances the economic role <b>accounting</b> <b>standards</b> play on cross-border M&A flows. After mandatory IFRS adoption, a 1 % increase in <b>accounting</b> <b>standards</b> disparity suppresses bilateral M&A flows by around 2 %; decrease in <b>accounting</b> <b>standards</b> disparity helps promote bilateral M&A flows when paired countries' governance infrastructure gap is relatively wider.
