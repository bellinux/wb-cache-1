5|$|A spine is <b>a</b> <b>sharp,</b> {{needle-like}} structure used {{to inflict}} pain on predators. An {{example of this}} seen in nature is in the Sohal surgeonfish. These fish have <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> scalpel-like spine {{on the front of}} each of their tail fins, able to inflict deep wounds. The area around the spines is often brightly colored to advertise the defensive capability; predators often avoid the Sohal surgeonfish. Defensive spines may be detachable, barbed or poisonous. Porcupine spines are long, stiff, break at the tip, and are barbed to stick into a would-be predator. In contrast, the hedgehog's short spines, which are modified hairs, readily bend, and are barbed into the body, so they are not easily lost; they may be jabbed at an attacker.|$|E
