5|$|The {{metabolic}} {{system of}} a particular organism determines which substances it will find nutritious and which poisonous. For example, some prokaryotes use hydrogen sulfide as a nutrient, yet this gas is poisonous to animals. The speed of metabolism, the metabolic rate, influences how much food an organism will require, and also affects how it is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> that food.|$|E

40|$|The hidden Web {{consists}} {{of data that}} is generally hidden behind form interfaces, and as such, {{it is out of}} reach for traditional search engines. With the goal of leveraging the high-quality information in this largely unexplored portion of the Web, in this paper, we propose a new strategy for automatically retrieving data hidden behind keyword-based form interfaces. Unlike previous approaches to this problem, our strategy adapts the query generation and selection by detecting features of the index. We describe a preliminary experimental evaluation which shows that our strategy is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> coverages that are higher than those of previous approaches that use a fixed strategy for query generation...|$|R
30|$|In this note, we {{defined the}} common {{property}} (E.A.) {{in the context}} of convex metric space that means here we assign the algebraic structure to the common property (E.A.) that is already exists in metric space. Due to this, we have been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>obtained</b> a set of common fixed point theorems in which to ensure the existence of common fixed points the condition of range of one set is contained in other is not required. Thus, this newly introduced concept plays a great role in solving many kinds of physical sciences problems which can be recast in terms of common fixed point problems.|$|R

Epstein later asked the Star-Club owner, Weissleder, not to publish photographs showing the group playing with tubes of Preludin. Starr explained that Dexedrine too was in plentiful supply in Hamburg, as it was known to produce increased wakefulness and focus, in association with decreased fatigue, and decreased appetite.|$|E

40|$|In this work, the {{efficiency}} of a multi-objective version of Generalized Extremal Optimization with real codification, called M-GEOreal, was tested by tackling an optimal attitude control problem of a rigid-flexible satellite. The satellite was controlled by a reaction wheel driven by a DC motor. M-GEOreal {{was used to determine}} the gains of two control laws types (a proportional derivative (PD) and a non-linear control law) that minimize, simultaneously, the time and the energy to control the satellite. The performance of M-GEOreal was compared to the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) method. By that investigation one observes that M-GEOreal is a very competitive approach to tackle this kind of problem, since it was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>obtained</b> better solutions than LQR method...|$|R
50|$|This obvious {{opposition}} to the Austrian rule forced him, after the Italian defeat in August 1848, to go in exile in Lugano. His name appeared {{in the list of}} citizens to whom the Marshal Josef Radetzky gave a heavy fine. The exile in Switzerland was a fundamental experience for his intellectual and political growth. He was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>obtained</b> a passport in 1849 and went on a trip all around Europe. He went first in France and then in other Italian States, residing {{for a long time in}} Florence.

5|$|The pillars {{that support}} {{the roof of the}} mantapa are {{monolithic}} shafts from the base up to the neck of the capital. Therefore, the height of the mantapa and the overall size of the temple were limited by the length of the stone shafts that the architects were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> from the quarries. The height of the temple was also constrained by the weight of the superstructure on the walls and, since Chalukyan architects did not use mortar, by the use of dry masonry and bonding stones without clamps or cementing material.|$|E

5|$|Artisans and {{craftsmen}} {{during the}} Han had a socio-economic status between that of farmers and merchants. Yet some were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> a valuable income, {{such as one}} craftsman who made knives and swords {{and was able to}} eat food fit for nobles and officials. Artisans and craftsmen also enjoyed a legal status that was superior to merchants. Unlike lowly merchants, artisans were allowed by law to wear fancy silks, ride on horseback, and ride in carriages. There were also no laws which barred artisans from becoming officials. An artisan painter who worked at the Imperial Academy turned down many offers to become nominated for public office. In contrast, a bureaucrat who appointed a merchant as an official could suffer impeachment from office, while some even avoided nominations by claiming they were merchants.|$|E

40|$|We {{first show}} that hypergeometric {{functions}} appear naturally as spectral functions when applying pseudo-differential calculus to decipher heat kernel asymptotic {{in the situation}} where the symbol algebra is noncommutative. Such observation leads to a unified (works for arbitrary dimension) method of computing the modular curvature on toric noncommutative manifolds. We show that the spectral functions that define the quantum part of the curvature have closed forms in terms of hypergeometric functions. As a consequence, we are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>obtained</b> explicit expressions (as functions in the dimension parameter) for those spectral functions without using symbolic integration. A surprising geometric consequence is that the functional relations coming from the variation of the associated Einstein-Hilbert action still hold when the dimension parameter takes real values.

5|$|For much of {{its early}} life, the school {{consisted}} only of Nathan Smith and a small class of students, operating in borrowed space at Dartmouth College. Students of Smith were educated as apprentices, and received a Bachelor of Medicine degree upon graduation. Like Dartmouth College as a whole, the medical school had continual funding shortages. As time passed, however, the popularity of both the medical instruction and the basic sciences taught at the school drew undergraduates and training physicians alike. Soliciting funds {{from the state of}} New Hampshire, Smith was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> medical equipment and, by 1811, a dedicated physical plant for the school.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies grow on the ground. Phellodon species, {{like all}} members of the order Thelephorales, are thought to be mycorrhizal, forming {{symbiotic}} relationships with trees. Usual hosts include species from the families Fagaceae (beeches and oaks) and Pinaceae. The ectomycorrhizae that P.niger forms with Norway spruce (Picea abies) has been comprehensively described. It is distinguished from the ectomycorrhizae of other Thelephorales species by the unique shape of its chlamydospores. Stable isotope ratio analysis of the abundance of the stable isotope carbon-13 shows that P.niger has a metabolic signature close to that of saprotrophic fungi, indicating that it may be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> carbon from sources other than a tree host.|$|E
5|$|In his High Court appeal Dietrich was {{represented}} by David Grace, QC.

Alternatively, he argued that the judge should have stayed or adjourned the trial until he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> counsel himself. His argument was based on the common law tradition that an accused is entitled to a fair trial.|$|E

Lord Morton tried to save the animal from extinction by starting a captive breeding program.

Lord Morton's mare was sold and was subsequently bred with a black stallion, resulting in offspring that again had zebra stripes. An account of this was published in 1820 by the Royal Society. This led to new ideas on telegony, referred to as pan-genesis by Charles Darwin.|$|E

Had surprise been achieved, the attack might well have succeeded, but Allied decoders at Ultra had intercepted and decrypted the orders for Operation Lüttich by August 4.
