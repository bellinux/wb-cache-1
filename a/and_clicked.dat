It's another nail out of the adventure gaming coffin—although admittedly quite a few remain." [...] Adventure Classic Gaming said, [...] "Not only the game succeeds in addressing many of the flaws in Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon that have plagued the previous title, this sequel is able to surpass the high standard and expectation set forth by past games in the series to create yet another chapter in {{the legend of the}} Knights Templar." [...] Eurogamer said, [...] "As an example of classic, back to basics point and click adventuring, there can perhaps be no finer recent example in the genre than The Angel of Death—it's a nailed-down must-buy if you're an adventure diehard who plays every one." ...|$|E

50|$|Bricks <b>and</b> <b>clicks</b> (aka <b>clicks</b> <b>and</b> bricks, <b>click</b> <b>and</b> mortar, bricks, <b>clicks</b> <b>and</b> flips, Womble Store Method (WSM) or WAMBAM) is a jargon {{term for}} a {{business}} model by which a company integrates both offline (bricks) <b>and</b> online (<b>clicks)</b> presences, sometimes with the third extra flips (physical catalogs). Additionally, many will also offer telephone ordering and mobile phone apps, or at least provide telephone sales support. The advent of mobile web has made businesses operating bricks <b>and</b> <b>clicks</b> businesses especially popular, because it means customers can do tasks like shopping when they have spare time {{and do not have}} to be at a computer. Many of these users prefer to use mobile shopping sites.|$|R

[...] It {{has been argued}} that a bricks <b>and</b> <b>clicks</b> business model is more difficult to implement than an online only model. In the future, the bricks <b>and</b> <b>clicks</b> model may be more successful, but in 2010 some online only businesses grew at a staggering 30%, while some bricks <b>and</b> <b>clicks</b> businesses grew at a paltry 3%. The key factor for a bricks <b>and</b> <b>clicks</b> business model to be successful [...] "will, to a large extent, be determined by a company’s ability to manage the trade-offs between separation and integration" [...] of their retail and online businesses.|$|R

60|$|They walked silently {{along the}} street for a little while. Lane had to {{accommodate}} his step to the slower movement of his crippled friend.

He {{would have liked}} to have expressed adhesion verbally to his superior officer's remarks. The words [...] "I don't think" [...] trembled on his tongue. But the iron discipline of the German Army gagged him. He saluted again <b>and</b> <b>clicked</b> his heels.|$|E
60|$|It {{was three}} or four months later when Ida was carried swiftly westward through the London streets toward twelve o'clock one night. The motor purred <b>and</b> <b>clicked</b> smoothly, {{slinging}} bright beams of light in front of it as it twisted eel-like through the traffic. The glass that would have sheltered Ida from the cool night breeze was down, but she scarcely noticed the roar of the city or the presence of Arabella and Mrs. Kinnaird.|$|E
60|$|Here Wildeve waited, {{slightly}} {{sheltered from}} the driving rain {{by a high}} bank that had been cast up at this place. Along {{the surface of the}} road where lit by the lamps the loosened gravel and small stones scudded <b>and</b> <b>clicked</b> together before the wind, which, leaving them in heaps, plunged into the heath and boomed across the bushes into darkness. Only one sound rose above this din of weather, and that was the roaring of a ten-hatch weir to the southward, from a river in the meads which formed the boundary of the heath in this direction.|$|E

60|$|My heart {{seemed to}} have changed to a nine-pounder ball as I listened to him. We had hoped against hope, but now when he, {{the man who was}} always serene and who always had reserves--when he, in that quiet, impassive voice of his, said that {{everything}} was over, we realized that the clouds had shut for ever, and the last gleam gone. Tremeau snarled and gripped at his sabre, Despienne ground his teeth, and for my own part I threw out my chest <b>and</b> <b>clicked</b> my heels to show the Emperor that there were some spirits which could rise to adversity.|$|E
60|$|It {{was then}} sent {{on to the}} young {{collector}} of skulls--who will, alas! collect no more, having now given his life to his country. It saddened me a little to part with it, certainly not {{because it was a}} pretty object to possess, but only because that bleached dome beneath which brains were once housed, and those huge black cavities which were once the windows of a strange soul, and that mouth that once had a fleshy tongue that youled <b>and</b> <b>clicked</b> in an unknown language could not tell me its own life-and-death history from the time of its birth in the African forest to its final translation to a wall over a stable door in an old house near London.|$|E

Mr. Deering sank into one of the chairs with a sigh of {{satisfaction}} which seemed to complete itself when he discovered in the thick grass at his feet a twig from one of the tall, slim pines above us. He bent over for it, and then, as he took out his penknife <b>and</b> <b>clicked</b> open a blade to begin whittling, he cast up a critical glance at the trees.|$|E

60|$|Perhaps {{a little}} too spasmodically I drew my revolver, aimed quickly and fired. I heard him yelp, saw him run {{sideways}} and turn, knew I had missed, <b>and</b> <b>clicked</b> back the cock with my thumb for the next shot. But he was already running headlong, jumping from side to side, and I dared not risk another miss. Every {{now and then he}} looked back at me over his shoulder. He went slanting along the beach, and vanished beneath the driving masses of dense smoke that were still pouring out from the burning enclosure. For some time I stood staring after him. I turned to my three obedient Beast Folk again and signalled them to drop the body they still carried. Then I went back to the place by the fire where the bodies had fallen and kicked the sand until all the brown blood-stains were absorbed and hidden.|$|E
60|$|To Clym's {{regret it}} began to rain and blow hard as the evening advanced. The wind rasped and scraped {{at the corners of}} the house, and filliped the eavesdroppings like peas against the panes. He walked restlessly about the untenanted rooms, {{stopping}} strange noises in windows and doors by jamming splinters of wood into the casements and crevices, and pressing together the lead-work of the quarries where it had become loosened from the glass. It was one of those nights when cracks in the walls of old churches widen, when ancient stains on the ceilings of decayed manor houses are renewed and enlarged from the size of a man's hand to an area of many feet. The little gate in the palings before his dwelling continually opened <b>and</b> <b>clicked</b> together again, but when he looked out eagerly nobody was there; it was as if invisible shapes of the dead were passing in on their way to visit him.|$|E
6000|$|We hurried on {{along the}} trace, which now sloped rapidly downhill. [...] Suddenly, a loathsome smell defiled the air. Was there a gas-house in the wilderness? Or had the pales of Paradise been just smeared with bad coal-tar? Not exactly: {{but across the}} path crept, festering in the sun, a black runnel of {{petroleum}} and water; and twenty yards to our left stood, under a fast-crumbling trunk, what was {{a year or two}} ago a little engine-house. Now roof, beams, machinery, were all tumbled and tangled in hideous and somewhat dangerous ruin, over a shaft, in the midst of which a rusty pump- cylinder gurgled, <b>and</b> <b>clicked,</b> and bubbled, and spued, with black oil and nasty gas; a foul ulcer in Dame Nature's side, which happily was healing fast beneath the tropic rain and sun. The creepers were climbing over it, the earth crumbling into it, and in a few years more the whole would be engulfed in forest, and the oil-spring, it is to be hoped, choked up with mud.|$|E
