Low forward resistance to motion, high speeds over the surface, and high lateral resistance help create high <b>apparent</b> <b>wind</b> speeds—with closer alignment of the <b>apparent</b> <b>wind</b> to the course traveled for most points of sail—and allow wind-powered vehicles to achieve higher speeds than conventional sailing craft.|$|E

25|$|Rotor-powered {{vehicles}} are wind-powered vehicles that use rotors—instead of sails—which {{may have a}} shroud around them (ducted fan) or constitute an unducted propeller, and which may adjust orientation to face the <b>apparent</b> <b>wind.</b> The rotor may be connected via a drive train to wheels or to a generator that provides electrical power to electric motors that drive the wheels.

25|$|The mast head {{instruments}} {{indication of}} <b>apparent</b> <b>wind</b> speed and direction {{is different from}} what the sailor sees and feels near the surface. Sailmakers may introduce sail twist {{in the design of}} the sail, where the head of the sail is set at a different angle of attack from the foot of the sail in order to change the lift distribution with height. The effect of wind gradient can be factored into the selection of twist in the sail design, but this can be difficult to predict since the wind gradient may vary widely in different weather conditions. Sailors may also adjust the trim of the sail to account for wind gradient, for example using a boom vang.|$|E
2500|$|Aerodynamic {{forces on}} sails depend on wind speed and {{direction}} {{and the speed}} {{and direction of the}} craft ( [...] VB [...] ). The direction that the craft is traveling with respect to the true wind (the wind direction and speed over the surface – VT [...] ) is called the point of sail. The speed of the craft at a given point of sail contributes to the <b>apparent</b> <b>wind</b> ( [...] VA [...] )—the wind speed and direction as measured on the moving craft. The <b>apparent</b> <b>wind</b> on the sail creates a total aerodynamic force, which may be resolved into drag—the force component {{in the direction of the}} apparent wind—and lift—the force component normal (90°) to the <b>apparent</b> <b>wind.</b> Depending on the alignment of the sail with the <b>apparent</b> <b>wind,</b> lift or drag may be the predominant propulsive component. Total aerodynamic force also resolves into a forward, propulsive, driving force—resisted by the medium through or over which the craft is passing (e.g. through water, air, or over ice, sand)—and a lateral force, resisted by the wheels or ice runners of the vehicle.|$|E

Simultaneous with this surge in the horizontal <b>winds,</b> an <b>apparent</b> downward <b>wind</b> of approximately 100 m/s lasting for 6 hours was also observed. The neutral temperature was observed to increase by approximately 400 K over all of the sites. Similar results of downward vertical winds and sustained heating have been seen in other geomagnetic storm events. The large sustained <b>apparent</b> downward <b>winds</b> are interpreted as arising from the contamination of the nominal spectral profile of the 630. 0 -nm population distribution, which is thermalized within the thermosphere region, by fast O related to the infusion of low-energy O+ ions that are generated by charge exchange and momentum transfer collisions. This interpretation is supported through simultaneous observations made by the Helium, Oxygen, Proton, and Electron spectrometer instruments on the twin Van Allen Probes spacecrafts, which show an influx of low-energy ions well correlated with the period of <b>apparent</b> downward <b>winds.</b> These results {{emphasize the importance of}} distributed networks of instruments in understanding the complex dynamics that occur in the upper atmosphere during disturbed conditions and represent an example of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling...|$|R

40|$|Observations of thermospheric neutral {{winds and}} {{temperatures}} obtained during a geomagnetic storm on 2 October 2013 from {{a network of}} six Fabry‐Perot interferometers (FPIs) deployed in the Midwest United States are presented. Coincident with the commencement of the storm, the <b>apparent</b> horizontal <b>wind</b> is observed to surge westward and southward (toward the equator). Simultaneous to this surge in the <b>apparent</b> horizontal <b>winds,</b> an <b>apparent</b> downward <b>wind</b> of approximately 100 m/s lasting for 6 h is observed. The apparent neutral temperature is observed to increase by approximately 400 K over all of the sites. Observations from an all‐sky imaging system operated at the Millstone Hill observatory indicate {{the presence of a}} stable auroral red (SAR) arc and diffuse red aurora during this time. We suggest that the large sustained <b>apparent</b> downward <b>winds</b> arise from contamination of the spectral profile of the nominal thermospheric 630. 0 nm emission by 630. 0 nm emission from a different (nonthermospheric) source. Modeling demonstrates that the effect of an additional population of 630. 0 nm photons, with a distinct velocity and temperature distribution, introduces an apparent Doppler shift when the combined emissions from the two sources are analyzed as a single population. Thus, the apparent Doppler shifts should not be interpreted as the bulk motion of the thermosphere, calling into question results from previous FPI studies of midlatitude storm time thermospheric winds. One possible source of contamination could be fast O related to the infusion of low‐energy O + ions from the magnetosphere. The presence of low‐energy O + is supported by observations made by the Helium, Oxygen, Proton, and Electron spectrometer instruments on the twin Van Allen Probes spacecraft, which show an influx of low‐energy ions during this period. These results emphasize the importance of distributed networks of instruments in understanding the complex dynamics that occur in the upper atmosphere during disturbed conditions.

Auto- and cross-correlation functions are derived based on wave scattering by randomly distributed particles. Antenna separation, mean wind, shear, and turbulence all contribute to signal de-correlation. Crossbeam wind cannot be separated from shear and thus crossbeam wind measurements are biased by shear. It is shown that SAI measures an <b>apparent</b> crossbeam <b>wind</b> (i. e., the angular shear of the radial wind component).
