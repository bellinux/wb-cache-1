5|$|Between his {{election}} and his inauguration, Garfield was occupied with assembling a cabinet that would establish peace between Conkling's and Blaine's warring factions. Blaine's delegates had provided {{much of the}} support for Garfield's nomination, and the Maine senator received the place of honor: Secretary of State. Blaine {{was not only the}} president's closest advisor, he was obsessed with knowing all {{that took place in the}} White House, and was even said to have spies posted there in his absence. Garfield nominated William Windom of Minnesota <b>as</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Treasury, William H. Hunt of Louisiana <b>as</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Navy, Robert Todd Lincoln as Secretary of War, and Samuel J. Kirkwood of Iowa <b>as</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Interior. New York was represented by Thomas Lemuel James as Postmaster General. Garfield appointed Pennsylvania's Wayne MacVeagh, an adversary of Blaine's, as Attorney General. Blaine tried to sabotage the appointment by convincing Garfield to name an opponent of MacVeagh, William E. Chandler, as Solicitor General under MacVeagh. Only Chandler's rejection by the Senate forestalled MacVeagh's resignation over the matter.|$|E

5|$|Later a {{portrait}} of Moreno was discovered {{that had been done}} from life, by the Peruvian silversmith Juan de Dios Rivera. This portrait was painted between 1808 or 1809, before Moreno's appointment <b>as</b> <b>secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Junta. It is now considered to be the closest representation of Moreno's real appearance. In this portrait, he is depicted with an elongated face, abundant hair, long sideburns, big eyes, and a pointy nose.|$|E
5|$|Mallory's {{nomination}} <b>as</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Navy {{was submitted}} to the Provisional Congress {{as soon as the}} act establishing a navy was passed. Despite his evident qualifications, it drew significant opposition; his detractors cited the Fort Pickens incident as evidence that he was not strongly pro-secession. Ultimately, however, he was confirmed.|$|E
5|$|On February 6, 2013, Jewell was {{nominated}} by President Barack Obama to succeed Ken Salazar as United States Secretary of the Interior. Her nomination {{was approved by}} the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on March 21, with only three of the committee's 22 members opposed. On April 10, 2013, the Senate confirmed Jewell to be Secretary of the Interior in an 87–11 vote. She was sworn in <b>as</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Interior on April 12, 2013. <b>As</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Interior she oversaw the Interior Department, which has a budget of $11billion, employs 70,000 people, and acted as steward for twenty percent of the United States of America's land.|$|E

5|$|The {{national}} debt increased {{as a result}} during Hamilton's service <b>as</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Treasury, but the nation established its good credit. Many in the Congress {{and elsewhere in the}} government profited from trading in the debt paper which was assumed. Many of Washington's fellow Virginians and others were vexed by this, but he considered that they had adequate redress through their Congressional representatives.|$|E
5|$|With Clayton's aid, Taylor {{chose the}} six {{remaining}} {{members of his}} cabinet. One of the incoming Congress's first actions would be to establish the Department of the Interior, so Taylor would be appointing that department's inaugural secretary. Thomas Ewing, who had previously served as a senator from Ohio and <b>as</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Treasury under William Henry Harrison, accepted the patronage-rich position of Secretary of the Interior. For the position of Postmaster General, which {{also served as a}} center of patronage, Taylor chose Congressman Jacob Collamer of Vermont. After Horace Binney refused appointment <b>as</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Treasury, Taylor chose another prominent Philadelphian in William M. Meredith. George W. Crawford a former Governor of Georgia, accepted the position of Secretary of War, while Congressman William B. Preston of Virginia became Secretary of the Navy. Senator Reverdy Johnson of Maryland accepted appointment as Attorney General, and Johnson {{became one of the most}} influential members of Taylor's cabinet. Vice President Fillmore was not in favor with Taylor, and Fillmore was largely sidelined throughout Taylor's presidency.|$|E
5|$|Bevin {{was sworn}} into a {{four-year}} term as Kentucky Governor on December 8, 2015. Observers {{from both parties}} praised Bevin's selection of experienced, relatively moderate individuals for his cabinet, including his former rival, Hal Heiner, <b>as</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Education and Workforce Cabinet and former University of Kentucky football standout Derrick Ramsey as his Secretary of Labor. The appointments of two Democratic state representatives– John Tilley <b>as</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Justice and Public Safety Cabinet and Tanya Pullin to a state judgeship– reduced the party's majority in the House and set up special elections that gave Republicans {{a chance to win}} their seats from Democrats. Bevin set the dates of the special elections to fill the seats of Tilley and Pullin, as well as those formerly held by newly elected Auditor Mike Harmon and newly elected Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles, for March 8, 2016. Democratic representatives Denver Butler and Jim Gooch also switched their party affiliation to Republican in December, reducing the Democratic majority to 50–46 for the beginning of the first General Assembly of Bevin's governorship, and giving Republicans a chance to evenly split the chamber's 100 seats by sweeping the special elections. Republicans held only Harmon's seat, giving Democrats a 53–47 advantage in the House {{for the remainder of the}} session.|$|E
50|$|Lunderville served <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Agency <b>of</b> Administration under Governor Jim Douglas.

50|$|Kelly Thomasson Mercer (born July 7, 1979) is an American Democratic {{politician}} {{who is now}} serving <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth <b>of</b> Virginia. She was appointed by Governor Terry McAuliffe to serve <b>as</b> Virginia's <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth after Levar Stoney resigned. Prior to her appointment to <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth, she served <b>as</b> Virginia's Deputy <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth since January 2014. Previously, she worked in Senator Mark Warner's office for 13 years.|$|R

5|$|Hamilton's {{resignation}} <b>as</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Treasury in 1795 did {{not remove}} him from public life. With the resumption of his law practice, he remained close to Washington as an advisor and friend. Hamilton influenced Washington {{in the composition of}} his Farewell Address by writing drafts for Washington to compare with the latter's draft, although when Washington contemplated retirement in 1792, he had consulted James Madison for a draft that was used in a similar manner to Hamilton's.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Cruft {{designed}} {{special train}} carriages to carry competition dogs for his shows {{from around the}} country. Cruft was Secretary of the Ranelagh Fox Terrier Show in 1901, and together with several colleagues including Sir Humphrey de Trafford created the National Terrier Club, and from the second show onwards on 21 June 1902, the show {{became known as the}} National Terrier Show. Cruft continued <b>as</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> club until 1914 when Sir William Savory took on the role.|$|E

5|$|Khachaturian went on {{to serve}} again <b>as</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Composers Union, {{starting}} in 1957 until his death. He was also a deputy in the fifth Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union (1958–62). In {{the last two decades}} of his life, Khachaturian wrote three concert rhapsodies—for violin (1961-2), cello (1963) and piano (1965)—and solo sonatas for unaccompanied cello, violin, and viola (1970s), which are considered to be his second and third instrumental trilogies.|$|E
5|$|No further {{specimens}} {{were collected}} until 1845, when Spencer Baird, {{a professor at}} Dickinson College, discovered a colony near New Bloomfield, Pennsylvania. It was redesignated G.brachycera in 1846 by Asa Gray {{on the basis of}} Baird's specimens. (Gaylussacia was not recognized as a genus separate from Vaccinium until 1819.) The discovery brought about a friendship between Gray and Baird that ultimately resulted in the latter's appointment <b>as</b> <b>secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
5|$|The family {{settled in}} a small cottage in Finchley, now a north London suburb, but then a village. Octavia Hill was {{impressed}} and moved by Henry Mayhew's London Labour and the London Poor, a book that portrayed {{the daily lives of}} slum dwellers.

5|$|Until about 1962, Khrushchev's {{position}} as Party leader was secure; {{but as the}} leader aged, he grew more erratic and his performance undermined the confidence of his fellow leaders. The Soviet Union's mounting economic problems also increased the pressure on Khrushchev's leadership. Outwardly, Brezhnev remained loyal to Khrushchev, but became involved in a 1963 plot to remove the leader from power, possibly playing a leading role. Also in 1963, Brezhnev succeeded Frol Kozlov, another Khrushchev protégé, <b>as</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Central Committee, positioning him as Khrushchev's likely successor. Khrushchev made him Second Secretary, literally deputy party leader, in 1964.|$|E
5|$|When U.S. Attorney General Levi Lincoln {{resigned}} in December 1804, Jefferson and Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin sought a replacement. Virginia's John Thomson Mason, Gallatin's first choice, declined the appointment. U.S. Navy Secretary Robert Smith desired the office, and Jefferson agreed to appoint him, contingent upon finding a suitable replacement for Smith <b>as</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Navy. Jefferson appointed Massachusetts Congressman Jacob Crowninshield to replace Smith, and both appointments were {{confirmed by the}} Senate March 3, 1805. Crowninshield refused his appointment, however, and Smith was forced to remain <b>as</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Navy. Jefferson then offered the position to Breckinridge, Gallatin's second choice. Breckinridge resigned from the Senate on August 7, 1805 to accept the appointment. He was the first U.S. cabinet-level official from west of the Allegheny Mountains, and his appointment boosted Jefferson's popularity in the west. Lowell Harrison called the appointment a mistake by Jefferson, not because Breckinridge lacked any qualifications, but because Jefferson {{was not able to}} replace his leadership in the Senate. He noted that after Breckinridge's departure from the chamber, the Federalist minority experienced a revival of influence under the leadership of Connecticut's Uriah Tracy.|$|E
5|$|With {{his return}} to the {{assembly}} he was appointed to the Commission du règlement et du suffrage universel (Commission for Regulation of Universal Suffrage); <b>as</b> <b>secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> commission from 1947 to 1948, he proposed on 18 February 1947 to reform French West Africa (AOF), French Equatorial Africa (AEF), and the French territories' federal council to better represent the African peoples.
