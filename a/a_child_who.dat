5|$|Engaging in work or an {{assigned}} task {{can generate}} an effective distraction from a reward and enable {{a person to}} wait for a longer delay, as long as the reward is not being flaunted. Having the reward present during work (and easily accessible) creates a negative frustration—akin to teasing—rather than providing motivation. For example, <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> can see other children playing outside while finishing his/her homework will be less motivated to wait for his/her turn for recess. Another factor work and task engagement adds to the delay of gratification is that if the work is interesting and has some reinforcing quality inherent to it, then attention to the reward will reduce work productivity since it becomes a distraction to the work rather than a motivation to finish it.|$|E
5|$|Gloucester's death destabilised the succession, as {{his mother}} {{was the only person}} {{remaining}} in the Protestant line to the throne established by the Bill of Rights 1689. Although Anne had ten other pregnancies after the birth of Gloucester, none of them resulted in <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> survived more than briefly after birth. The English parliament did not want the throne to revert to a Catholic, so it passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which settled the throne of England on a cousin of King James, Sophia, Electress of Hanover, and her Protestant heirs. Anne succeeded King William in 1702, and reigned until her death on 1 August 1714. Sophia predeceased her by a few weeks, and so Sophia's son George ascended the throne as the first British monarch of the House of Hanover.|$|E

5|$|Some bioethicists deem it {{reasonable}} {{for parents to}} select <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> would have the highest well-being. One criticism of this reasoning is that it often values those with disabilities less. Some parents argue that Down syndrome shouldn't be prevented or cured and that eliminating Down syndrome amounts to genocide. The disability rights movement {{does not have a}} position on screening, although some members consider testing and abortion discriminatory. Some in the United States who are pro-life support abortion if the fetus is disabled, while others do not. Of a group of 40 mothers in the United States who have had one child with Down syndrome, half agreed to screening in the next pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|The {{accession}} of Frederick, <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> {{would then}} become also the Holy Roman Emperor FrederickII in 1197, greatly affected {{the immediate future}} of Sicily. For a land so used to centralised royal authority, the king's young age caused a serious power vacuum. His uncle Philip of Swabia moved to secure Frederick's inheritance by appointing Markward von Anweiler, margrave of Ancona, regent in 1198. Meanwhile, Pope InnocentIII had reasserted papal authority in Sicily, but recognised Frederick's rights. The pope was to see papal power decrease steadily {{over the next decade}} and was unsure about which side to back at many junctures.|$|E
5|$|The silent {{protagonist of}} FireRed and LeafGreen is <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> {{lives in a}} small town named Pallet Town. After players start a journey and venture alone into tall grass, a voice warns them to stop. Professor Oak, a famous Pokémon researcher, {{explains}} to the player that such grass is often the habitat of wild Pokémon, and encountering them alone can be very dangerous. He takes the player to his laboratory where the player meets Oak's grandson, another aspiring Pokémon Trainer. The player and their rival are both instructed to select a starter Pokémon for their travels. The rival then challenges the player to a Pokémon battle with their newly obtained Pokémon and continues to battle the player at certain points throughout the games.|$|E

5|$|After the child's {{father was}} allowed to visit him during August and September 1858, two starkly {{different}} narratives emerged—one told of a boy who wanted {{to return to his}} family and the faith of his ancestors, while the other described <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> had learned the catechism perfectly and wanted his parents to become Christians as well. International protests mounted, but the Pope would not be moved. After pontifical rule in Bologna ended in 1859, Father Feletti was prosecuted for his role in Mortara's seizure, but was acquitted when the court decided he had simply followed orders. With the Pope as a substitute father, Mortara trained for the priesthood in Rome until the Kingdom of Italy captured the city in 1870, ending the Papal States. Leaving the country, he was ordained in France three years later at the age of 21. Father Mortara {{spent most of his life}} outside Italy and died in Belgium in 1940, aged 88.|$|E
5|$|Like other Pokémon games, Ruby and Sapphires {{gameplay}} is linear; {{the main}} events {{occur in a}} fixed order. The protagonist of Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire is <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> has recently moved to a small town called Littleroot Town. At {{the beginning of the}} games, the player chooses either Treecko, Torchic, or Mudkip to protect Professor Birch, the regional Professor, from an attacking wild Pokémon. After defending the Professor, the player is taken to his lab and receives the chosen Pokémon as his or her starter Pokémon. His or her friend, the protagonist's rival, is also a Pokémon Trainer and occasionally battles the player. The games' two main goals are defeating the eight Gym Leaders, proving oneself worthy of challenging the Elite Four and Champion to become the new Champion and completing the Pokédex by capturing, evolving, and trading to obtain all 202 Pokémon (It is possible to obtain all 386 Pokémon, but this requires trading with Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen).|$|E
5|$|On {{account of}} the rivalry between the chiefs of Bobbili and Vizianagaram, in 1756 there was a {{rebellion}} among the local chieftains which necessitated strong military measures. General Bussy attacked the rebel forces with a contingent of European forces, supported by 11,000 troops of the Raja of Vizianagaram as a token of his loyalty. The Raja of Vizianagaram instigated General Bussy by a canard stating that the Raja of Bobbili was behind the rebellion. It is {{also said that the}} Raja bribed his interpreters to persuade General Bussy to direct Ranga Rao, the Raja of Bobbili to vacate the Bobbili Fort and shift southward. General Bussy cautiously made an offer to the Chief of Bobbili that he would be pardoned if he moved away from Bobbili, and in return given a compensatory package of equivalent land elsewhere. But this was not acceptable to the Chief of Bobbili. Then, General Bussy attacked the fort several times, breached the mud fort with cannons, and took control of the ramparts of the fort. Although the Raja of Bobbili and his defenders realized their precarious condition, they fought fiercely but eventually lost the battle. When General Bussy entered the fort with his depleted strength of soldiers he found dead bodies scattered in the fort area. At that time an old man approached General Bussy and handed him <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> he said was the son of the dead Raja of Bobbili. The Raja of Vizianagaram, happy with his victory in the hard fought battle, rejoiced by entering the Bobbili city and hoisted the Flag of France. But his jubilation was short lived. Three days after this event, the Raja of Vizianagaram's camp was attacked in the night by three people of Bobbili, including Tandra Paparayudu who had rushed to the demolished Bobbili Fort to help his sister's family. He killed the Raja of Vizianagaram and then committed suicide along with his accomplices.|$|E

25|$|Gardner {{argues that}} there is a wide range of {{cognitive}} abilities, but that there are only very weak correlations among them.

The child who takes more time to master multiplication may best learn to multiply through a different approach, may excel in a field outside mathematics, or may be looking at and understanding the multiplication process at a fundamentally deeper level.|$|E
