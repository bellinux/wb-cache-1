40|$|To {{study the}} {{evolution}} of the <b>alimentary</b> <b>bolus</b> in relation with the loss of forest cover in the Congo Basin, we conducted semi-structured surveys on the composition, origin and amount spent to prepare meals in three study sites with a contrasted forest cover gradient. At global level, the cost price of meals increases as the forest cover decreases. The share of the <b>alimentary</b> <b>bolus</b> in relation with the use of natural resources such as hunting, fishing and harvesting drops to the benefit of proteins from livestock and agricultural commodities. This leads to a translocation of the demand but also pressures on other anthropized ecosystems. The effects of deforestation are subsequently felt at local level but also in neighboring areas.

40|$|The {{contents}} of digestive systems in six freshwater bivalve {{species of the}} family Sphaeriidae were investigated. Microorganisms in the stomachs and intestines of the bivalves {{were the same as}} found suspended in the water, which implies none or very limited preingestive selection, at least of the organic particles. Most of the organisms (coccal algae, diatoms, flagellates, euglenophytes, Zygnematophycaea, monadoid algae, bacteria) probably pass through the digestive system unharmed, as they were found alive even in the <b>alimentary</b> <b>bolus</b> in the hindgut. Probably only a small proportion of them is digested, in particular the bacteria and monadoid algae, the abundance of which decreased especially following starvation. In starved animals, food particles were also present in the digestive diverticula, apparently in order to increase food utilisation...|$|E

Morphological examination of the control midgut, fed with blood of a healthy donor revealed a fully developed PM by 16 h (Fig. 1). It appears at the light microscope level as a light brownish layer between the interstitial epithelium and the <b>alimentary</b> <b>bolus.</b> The PM structure was recognised as an amorphous and laminated structure segregating the blood meal. The PM enclosed and surrounded the entire blood meal just above the epithelium. The PM increased its thickness at 20 h and decreased at 24 h, in the midgut obtained from Anopheles (Fig. 1), when th...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDeoxynivalenol (DON), one of {{the most}} {{abundant}} mycotoxins found on cereals, is known to be implicated in acute and chronic illnesses in both humans and animals. Among the symptoms, anorexia, reduction of weight gain and decreased nutrition efficiency were described, but the mechanisms underlying these effects on feeding behavior are not yet totally understood. Swallowing is a major motor component of ingestive behavior which allows the propulsion of the <b>alimentary</b> <b>bolus</b> from the mouth to the esophagus. To better understand DON effects on ingestive behaviour, we have studied its effects on rhythmic swallowing in the rat, after intravenous and central administration. Repetitive electrical stimulation of the superior laryngeal nerve or of the tractus solitarius, induces rhythmic swallowing that can be recorded using electromyographic electrodes inserted in sublingual muscles. Here we provide the first demonstration that, after intravenous and central administration, DON strongly inhibits the swallowing reflex with a short latency and in a dose dependent manner. Moreover, using c-Fos staining, a strong neuronal activation was observed in the solitary tract nucleus which contains the central pattern generator of swallowing and in the area postrema after DON intravenous injection. Our data show that DON modifies swallowing and interferes with central neuronal networks dedicated to food intake regulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to evaluate the impact of deforestation on non-timber forest products (NTFPs) harvest in Central Africa. The most common vegetal NTFPs are fruits, barks and leaves used as complements to the staple food (cassava or plantain). Animal NTFPs such as caterpillars, worms and bush meat represent a major source of animal protein in the villagers ’ diet. We analyzed the evolution of several parameters including NTFPs diversity, distance to the road, changes in land tenure rules, proportion in the <b>alimentary</b> <b>bolus</b> and in the villagers ’ incomes. The research is based on field surveys, participatory mapping and geolocation of activities held in 8 villages. Three study sites are located at different stages on Mather’s forest transition curve (Mather, 1992). This curve shows the relationship between forest cover and population density. The sites represent the situations: (i) important cover of intact forest, (ii) forest partially degraded and under pressure of conversion to other land uses and (iii) small surfaces of degraded forest with a trend of plantation of useful trees on deforested land. Results show a reduction in NTFPs diversity along with the increase of deforestation. The maximum distance of collection sites to the road increases between the first and the second study site, as...|$|E
40|$|Persistence of mouse mammary {{tumour virus}} (MMTV) {{components}} in the digestive tract of suckling mice was investigated by immunoperoxidase staining of the main viral antigens and micra-immunoenzyme assays of gp 52 and p 28; these latter assays were also performed after ingestion of milk enriched in viral antigens using Cr 20 3 as a marker for the <b>alimentary</b> <b>bolus</b> migration. When compared to the ingested antigens, the amounts Of gp 52 and p 28 decreased during transit, p 28 being more rapidly digested than gp 52. The antigens were, however, destroyed to a much larger extent in the gut of the adult than in that of the newborn mouse. A fraction of the marker emained {{for a long time}} in the stomach; a prolonged retention was also observed with gp 52 and especially with p 28. Significant amounts of viral antigens were detected in the intestinal walls: both p 28 and gp 52 were found in the duodenum and small intestine. Moreover, the four viral antigens gp 52, gp 36, p 28 and p 8 were clearly observed in very large supranuclear vacuoles inside the epithelial cells of the distal part of the gut. Total particles can reach the intestine; the viral material could then be either destroyed or taken up in the epithelial cells by endocytosis, o that the intestinal epithelium might serve as a portal of entry for MMTV in the suckling mouse...|$|E
40|$|Background: Saliva plays a {{critical}} role in maintaining oral homeostasis; it modulates the ecosystem through lubrication of the <b>alimentary</b> <b>bolus,</b> protection against microorganisms, buffer and repair of the oral mucosa, and helps in dental re-mineralization. Various local and systemic factors such as medications, radiation therapy, systemic conditions, etc. can lead to reduction in salivary flow. A decrease in salivary function, known as Xerostomia, increases a patient's risk for caries and other oral infections. Palliative management of Xerostomia includes wetting agents such as ice chips, drugs and saliva substitutes. Systemic agents stimulate salivary flow but often have unfavorable side effects. Newer modalities like transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), which has fewer side effects, have been used to stimulate salivary flow. The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess and evaluate the effect of TENS on whole salivary flow rates in healthy adult subjects. Study Design: A total of 80 healthy adult subjects were enrolled in the study. Unstimulated and stimulated saliva (using TENS) was collected for 5 minutes and the mean salivary flow rates were calculated. Data obtained was analyzed using the SPSS (Statistical package for social sciences) version 15. Students "t" test was employed for comparative analysis. Results: Sixty-five of the 80 subjects demonstrated an increase in the salivary flow rate on application of TENS. Twelve subjects demonstrated a mild reduction in the salivary flow rates. Seven subjects experienced transient mild twitching of facial musculature as side effects. Conclusions: Significant increase in salivary flow rates was observed on application of TENS with minimal or no side effects...|$|E
40|$|The Diabetes Mellitus II type is {{a chronic}} {{pathology}} {{typical of the}} third age. With {{the course of the}} illness the person affected by DM can present long term complications that aggravate the clinical picture. Systemic diseases such as the diabetes mellitus can influence very much the diet of the affected patient; and besides that the dehydration joined to the hyperglicemia, the neuropathy and the diabetic angiopathy can cause xerestomy. The saliva, important for the organization of the <b>alimentary</b> <b>bolus,</b> dissolving partly the food, makes possible a better contact with the gustatory papillas helping the taste perception, cleans and reduce the attachment of the plaque on dental surface and mucosas and makes better the attachment of the total prothesis to the mucous surface of the maxillaries. The hyposcialia makes difficult the deglutition and the mastication, reduces the prothesis retention and causes oral lesions of the mucosas given by backing lubrification. The absorption of food and its digestion as regard to a diabetic patient, can be modified by the presence of autonomic neuropathy that, even if not clinically evident, aims to increase the intestinal peristalsis up to phenomenon such as the ”diarrea diabeticorum”. A lack of metabolic compensation as we can deduce from the measurement of the HbA 1 c,can easily bring infections, micro and macroangiopathy, polyneuropathies,diabetic retinopathy proliferative and not, AOCAI,IRC, ulcers, phlegmous, osteomyelitis to lower limbs diabetic foot and soon. Some of these complications affect the stomatognathic apparatus with connected more frequency and aggressiveness of parodontopathies, easy gingival bleeding, microangiopathy of gingival tissue and profound paradontium, stomatodinia from neuropathy, disgeusia, xerestomy from hyperglycemia, and soon. All this can cause an untimely increase of dental mobility, evidence of loss of tissue of dental support, alveolar ligament-bone-radicul cement and consequently untimely loss of dental elements. Considering that the correct working of the masticatory apparatus is the first essential phase of a fit digestion, we can understand the importance of a proper dietetic and pharmacological diet that allows the patient to be compensated. The aim of this thesis, besides explaining the clinical pictures of DM, its long term complications and the consequences on the stomatognathic system, is to check whether or not in diabetic patients the deterioration of the chewing apparatus is bigger than in non diabetic persons. The data gathered from the clinical oral examination of 553 diabetic patients have been checked with those of 112 non diabetic patients; all the persons have been treated at the INRCA –Ancona- or at G. Mazzini Hospital-Teramo- and have been screened during these three years...|$|E
40|$|É de grande importância à realização adequada das funções orais - as quais influenciam e sofrem influência dos aspectos morfológicos e miofuncionais orofaciais - para possibilitar o equilíbrio e desenvolvimento do complexo craniofacial. Assim, distúrbios miofuncionais orais podem interferir de forma negativa no desenvolvimento craniofacial, refletindo se também no desenvolvimento psicossocial da criança. O trabalho visou caracterizar os aspectos miofuncionais orofaciais e vocais crianças do município de Monte Negro/RO. Respeitando-se os aspectos éticos, dois grupos de escolares do município de Monte Negro/RO, de ambos os gêneros, foram formados de acordo com a faixa etária: grupo I (GI) composto por 47 crianças entre 6 e 8 anos e grupo II (GII) formado por 36 crianças entre 9 e 11 anos. A partir da avaliação miofuncional {{orofacial}} convencional, as crianças foram avaliadas quanto aos aspectos estruturas como: tipo facial e relação dentária, postura habitual dos lábios e da língua; estado de contração muscular dos lábios, língua, bochechas, masseteres e mentual; mobilidade e motricidade dos lábios, língua, mandíbula e véu palatino; além das funções de respiração, mastigação, deglutição, fala e voz. Foram utilizadas filmagens e gravação em MD para a coleta dos dados, e posterior análise, necessários à pesquisa. Os resultados demonstram para os dois grupos, alterações nas relações dentárias, bem como nos aspectos miofuncionais orofaciais no que se refere ao estado de contração muscular, mobilidade e motricidade, bem como para as funções respiratórias, especificamente quanto ao modo; a função mastigatória, principalmente, quanto a formação do bolo alimentar, conseqüentemente, alterações quanto a deglutição, e no que se refere a fala e a voz, as alterações apresentaram -se em menor porcentagem. Portanto a promoção de ações que viabilizem o trabalho de adequação das funções orofaciais e da voz, bem como o desenvolvimento de programas de prevenção na área de Motricidade Oral, tornam-se essenciais para o desenvolvimento das crianças do município de Monte Negro/RO. The {{accomplishment of}} the orofacial functions {{is fundamental to}} promote craniofacialś balance and development, when accomplished correctly. Thus, myofunctional disturbs can intervene negative with the craniofacial development, also reflecting in the psychosocial development of the child. The objective of this work was to characterize the orofacial and vocal myofunctional aspects {{of the children of}} the city of Monte Negro/RO. Respecting the ethical aspects, 83 school children were evaluated and divided in groups in accordance with the age: GI (47 children between 6 and 8 years) and GII (36 children between 9 and 11 years). We verified in the orofacial myofunctional evaluation the following aspects: face type and dental habits; habitual position of lip and language; state of muscular contraction of masseter, cheek, lip, language and mentual; mobility/motricity of lips, tong, jaw and palatal veil; beyond breathing, chew, deglutition, speech and voice. We used movie recordings and recording in MD for the collection of the data. Mesofacial and dolichofacial types were observed; alteration in the dental relation, with bigger occurrence in the GI, characterized mainly for horizontal alteration; great occurrence of alteration in the lip and tong position, {{as well as in the}} state of muscular contraction, being diminished for cheek, lip and language and increased to masseter and mentual; difficulty in the lip and tong mobility, and little alteration in the mandible mobility; more than the half of the GI showed modified respiratory way and less of the half in the GII, with little alteration in the respiratory type in the two groups; little occurrence of alteration in the chew, except in the formation of the <b>alimentary</b> <b>bolus,</b> observed in more than the half of the sample; great occurrence of alteration in the deglutition, but a little bigger in the GI; phonetic alteration of speech was also present in more than the half of the GI and less in the GII, with little speech alteration in the articulator type; e, little occurrence of vocal alterations. Thus, in view of the occurrence of myofunctional alterations in the studied sample, the promotion of action for the adequacy of the modified functions becomes necessary for the good development of the children of the city of Monte Negro/RO...|$|E
