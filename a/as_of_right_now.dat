2500|$|The Husky moniker {{has been}} adopted for the 2005-06 season by the town's local Juvenile Minor Hockey Team in the WOAA. <b>As</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> there is no known effort to return the Huskies back {{to a higher level}} of hockey. It is {{doubtful}} that this is the last the town of Durham will see of the Husky franchise, but the team seems to be dead in the water for the time being. As of 2006-07, the OPJHL's Oshawa Legionnaires became the Durham Fury, which will play out of the Campus Ice Center in Oshawa, Ontario. Although it was unlikely that the Huskies would have ever re-entered the OPJHL, as their recent efforts were to join the Western Junior [...] "C" [...] League, the creation of the Fury would definitely be a rumour-killer for an OPJHL comeback.|$|E

2500|$|In {{regards to}} the {{possibility}} of a sequel, Vega has been quoted as saying: [...] "From the very, very beginning, we always talked about a prequel or a sequel to this film. And it's hard, because <b>as</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> we all want to do it, but, you know, it didn't really do as we hoped. We didn't really have a lot of support. But we're hoping that the fans will come back, and it will be an underground cult classic that will grow, and that will eventually spark us to do another." [...] Bousman also indicated interest, stating; [...] "I would love to follow up Repo and finish the story, because it was conceived as a three-part movie. But this movie is all about support from the internet, and support from fans. This is not a movie where you'll see billboards or bus stop ads or trailers on TV." [...] It was additionally expected that Hilton would return in her role as Amber Sweet. However, in a video posted on YouTube, it was revealed that they [...] "no longer control {{the answer to the question}} [...] " [...] since they no longer have ownership of the franchise, thus driving Bousman and Zdunich to make The Devil's Carnival.|$|E
2500|$|Series {{executive}} {{producers and}} co-creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk stated that, {{as with the}} second season, [...] "many actors" [...] would return for the third season in different roles. Jessica Lange, Evan Peters and Sarah Paulson all confirmed their returns. Murphy added that Lange would portray a [...] "real glamour-cat lady", whose name was later revealed to be Fiona Goode. Paulson {{said in an interview}} that her character would [...] "definitely [...] different [...]" [...] She added, [...] "Basically, she's going to look different, and my relationship to Lange is going to be quite different this time. At the beginning of last season, no one knew that Lana would be the hero, so it's possible I could end up the evil one this year. <b>As</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> there will be some of Lana Winters' qualities in my character, but I don't know for sure." [...] Taissa Farmiga, who played a lead role in the first season, starred as Zoe Benson, a character involved in a prominent romance with Peters' character. Lily Rabe and Frances Conroy portrayed series regulars Misty Day and Myrtle Snow, respectively. Kathy Bates co-starred as Delphine LaLaurie, an evil woman from the past who tortures her slaves. Murphy stated that Bates' character would be [...] "five times worse than [...] Misery character" [...] and is also inspired by a [...] "true event". It was reported on May 22, 2013 that Emma Roberts would co-star as Madison Montgomery, a difficult Hollywood starlet.|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} some major concern for the {{population}} in the Mekong River due to numerous threats. In the 1970s, many Irrawaddy Dolphins were slaughtered for oil and soon after, there was intensive fishing practices with explosives and gill nets [...] <b>As</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> the dolphins are protected in Cambodia and Laos Democratic Republic. Now, both explosive fishing and use of gill nets is restricted in many of the Irrawaddy Dolphin's habitats. Canadian conservationist Ian Baird set up the Lao Community Fisheries and Dolphin Protection Project to study the Irrawaddy dolphins in the Lao part of the Mekong. Part of this project compensated fishers for the loss of nets damaged to free entangled dolphins. This project was expanded to include Cambodia, after the majority of the dolphin population was determined to have been killed or migrated to Laos' southern neighbour. The Si Phan Don Wetlands Project has successfully encouraged river communities to set aside conservation zones and establish laws to regulate how and when fish are caught. In April, after a 200kg Irrawaddy Dolphin was found dead on the coast of Laos, the death toll for Irrawaddy Dolphins is now five in the year 2015. Usually, Irrawaddy Dolphins are found dead with bruises and scars on their body being killed by illegal poaching, however this Irrawaddy Dolphin was found dead because of old age. She is the oldest and largest Irrawaddy Dolphin researchers have discovered. The dolphin was 2.5 meters in length and most likely in her late 20's. The body will be taken to the WWF office for an autopsy of the body.|$|E
