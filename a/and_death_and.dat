5|$|Gauguin {{first visited}} Tahiti in 1891, and {{attracted}} by the beauty of Tahitian women undertook a set of sculptural mask-like portraits on paper. They evoke both melancholy <b>and</b> <b>death,</b> <b>and</b> conjure the state of faaturuma (brooding or melancholy); imagery and moods later used in the Oviri ceramic. Gauguin's first wood carvings in Tahiti were with a guava wood that quickly crumbled and have not survived.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{noted that}} the book took on a darker tone than its predecessors, though it did contain some humour.

The character development of Harry and several other teenage characters was also remarked upon.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the varied}} and even {{contradictory}} {{interpretations of the}} colour green, its precise meaning in the poem remains ambiguous. In English folklore and literature, green was traditionally used to symbolise nature and its associated attributes: fertility and rebirth. Stories of the medieval period also used it to allude to love and the base desires of man. Because of its connection with faeries and spirits in early English folklore, green also signified witchcraft, devilry and evil. It can also represent decay and toxicity. When combined with gold, as with the Green Knight and the girdle, green was often seen as representing youth's passing. In Celtic mythology, green was associated with misfortune <b>and</b> <b>death,</b> <b>and</b> therefore avoided in clothing. The green girdle, originally worn for protection, {{became a symbol of}} shame and cowardice; it is finally adopted as a symbol of honour by the knights of Camelot, signifying a transformation from good to evil and back again; this displays both the spoiling and regenerative connotations of the colour green.|$|E

5|$|Lyfjaberg {{is where}} the goddess sits {{surrounded}} by her helpful spirits. Although healing by a goddess—or indeed by a god either—has left little mark on Norse myths as they have come down to us, {{there is no doubt}} that the healing power of goddesses was of enormous importance in daily life in the pre-Christian period, as was that of many women saints in Christian times. The goddess who presided over childbirth was held to possess power over life <b>and</b> <b>death,</b> <b>and</b> was revered as a lifegiver, both in the family home and in the courts of kings, though she might also pass sentence of death.|$|E

5|$|While The Legend of Korra was {{produced}} in the United States and therefore not a work of Japanese animation ("anime") in the strict sense, The Escapist magazine argued that the series is so strongly influenced by anime that it would otherwise easily be classified as such: its protagonists (a superpowered heroine, her group of talented, supporting friends, a near-impervious villain who wants to reshape the world), its themes (family, friendship, romance, fear, <b>and</b> <b>death)</b> <b>and</b> {{the quality of its}} voice acting as well as the visual style {{are similar to those of}} leading anime series such as , Bleach or Trigun. A notable difference from such series is the absence of lengthy opening and ending sequences set to J-pop songs; to save broadcast time, The Legend of Korras openings and endings last only a few seconds. The series mostly abstains from using the visual tropes characteristic of anime, but does occasionally use exaggerated facial expressions to highlight emotions for comic effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} in the pre-dawn hours as the young Nick Adams, his father, his uncle and their Indian guides row across a lake to a nearby Indian camp. Nick's father, a doctor, has been called out to deliver a baby {{for a woman who}} has been in labor for days. At the camp, they find the woman in a cabin lying on a bottom bunkbed; her husband lies above her with an injured foot. Nick's father is forced to perform a {{caesarian}} operation on the woman with a jack-knife because the baby is in the breech position; he asks Nick to assist by holding a basin. The woman screams throughout the operation, and when Nick's uncle tries to hold her down, she bites him. After the baby is delivered, Nick's father turns to the woman's husband on the top bunk and finds that he fatally slit his throat with a straight razor during the operation. Nick is sent out of the cabin, and his uncle leaves with two Natives, not to return. The story ends with only Nick and his father on the lake, rowing away from the camp. Nick asks his father questions about birth <b>and</b> <b>death,</b> <b>and</b> thinks to himself that he will never die, as he watches his father row.|$|E
