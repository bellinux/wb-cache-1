40|$|OBJECTIVES: Drug safety {{problems}} {{can lead to}} hospital admission. In Brazil, the prevalence of hospitalization due to <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events</b> is unknown. This study aims to estimate the prevalence of hospitalization due to <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events</b> and to identify the <b>drugs,</b> the <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events,</b> and the risk factors associated with hospital admissions. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was performed in the internal medicine ward of a teaching hospital in S&# 227;o Paulo State, Brazil, from August to December 2008. All patients aged &# 8805; 18 years with a length of stay &# 8805; 24 hours were interviewed about the drugs used prior to hospital admission and their symptoms/complaints/causes of hospitalization. RESULTS: In total, 248 patients were considered eligible. The prevalence of hospitalization due to potential <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events</b> in the ward was 46. 4 %. Overprescribed drugs and those indicated for prophylactic treatments were frequently associated with possible <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events.</b> Frequently reported symptoms were breathlessness (15. 2 %), fatigue (12. 3 %), and chest pain (9. 0 %). Polypharmacy was {{a risk factor for}} the occurrence of possible <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events.</b> CONCLUSION: Possible <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events</b> led to hospitalization in a high-complexity hospital, mainly in polymedicated patients. The clinical outcomes of <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events</b> are nonspecific, which delays treatment, hinders causality analysis, and contributes to the underreporting of cases...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{in this study}} is to describe <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events</b> for elderly patients &# 8805; 70 years, as they are registered in the national database of <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events</b> at the Norwegian Medicines Agency in 2010. In Norway, a relevance-validated list of drugs, drug dosages and drug combinations to be avoided in elderly (&# 8805; 70 years) patients has been developed; the so-called Norwegian General Practice (NORGEP) criteria. As a secondary objective, I wanted to investigate the frequency of registered <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events</b> matching these criteria. 280 <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events</b> were registered for elderly &# 8805; 70 years in the national database during 2010. 63 % were regarded as serious <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events,</b> and 16 % had resulted in death. Warfarin is the drug registered with most <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events,</b> most of them described as cerebral bleedings. Regarding the NORGEP criteria, I only found 6 hits in the database. The spontaneous reporting system is believed to be hampered by a major underreporting. The results presented in the current study are therefore probably not representative of real-life medical practice, but comprise just a tip of the iceberg. I suspect that the system used is more likely to detect acute traumatic events such as cerebral bleedings, but that it fails to identify minor, less serious and more prolonged <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events.</b> I believe that better knowledge among health personnel, more focus and better time during the work day to handle <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events</b> would increase the degree of reporting and give us more knowledge on how to reduce <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events</b> in the elderly...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT: <b>Adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events,</b> {{especially}} those that may be preventable, {{are among the most}} serious concerns about medication use in older persons cared for in the ambulatory clinical setting. OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence and preventability of <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events</b> among older persons in the ambulatory clinical setting. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Cohort study of all Medicare enrollees (30 397 person-years of observation) cared for by a multispecialty group practice during a 12 -month study period (July 1, 1999, through June 30, 2000), in which possible drug-related incidents occurring in the ambulatory clinical setting were detected using multiple methods, including reports from health care providers; review of hospital discharge summaries; review of emergency department notes; computer-generated signals; automated free-text review of electronic clinic notes; and review of administrative incident reports concerning medication errors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events,</b> severity of the events (classified as significant, serious, life-threatening, or fatal), and whether the events were preventable. RESULTS: There were 1523 identified <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events,</b> of which 27. 6 % (421) were considered preventable. The overall rate of <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events</b> was 50. 1 per 1000 person-years, with a rate of 13. 8 preventable <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events</b> per 1000 person-years. Of the <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events,</b> 578 (38. 0 %) were categorized as serious, life-threatening, or fatal; 244 (42. 2 %) of these more severe events were deemed preventable compared with 177 (18. 7 %) of the 945 significant <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events.</b> Errors associated with preventable <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events</b> occurred most often at the stages of prescribing (n = 246, 58. 4 %) and monitoring (n = 256, 60. 8 %), and errors involving patient adherence (n = 89, 21. 1 %) also were common. Cardiovascular medications (24. 5 %), followed by diuretics (22. 1 %), nonopioid analgesics (15. 4 %), hypoglycemics (10. 9 %), and anticoagulants (10. 2 %) were the most common medication categories associated with preventable <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events.</b> Electrolyte/renal (26. 6 %), gastrointestinal tract (21. 1 %), hemorrhagic (15. 9 %), metabolic/endocrine (13. 8 %), and neuropsychiatric (8. 6 %) events were the most common types of preventable <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events.</b> CONCLUSIONS: <b>Adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events</b> are common and often preventable among older persons in the ambulatory clinical setting. More serious <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events</b> {{are more likely to be}} preventable. Prevention strategies should target the prescribing and monitoring stages of pharmaceutical care.

5000|$|An adverse drug {{reaction}} (ADR) is {{an injury}} caused by taking a medication. ADRs may occur following a single dose or prolonged administration of a drug or result from the combination {{of two or more}} drugs. The meaning of this expression differs from the meaning of [...] "side effect", as this last expression might also imply that the effects can be beneficial. The study of ADRs is the concern of the field known as pharmacovigilance. An <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>event</b> (ADE) refers to any injury occurring at the time a drug is used, {{whether or not it is}} identified as a cause of the injury. An ADR is a special type of ADE in which a causative relationship can be shown.|$|E
50|$|The aims of RADAR are to {{disseminate}} safety reports for serious adverse drug reactions (sADRs) {{and to identify}} barriers to identification and reporting of these clinical events. Investigators have developed a well-coordinated system to accurately compile case report information on sADRs and to identify milestones associated with identification and reporting of the relevant ADR information. This ADR identification system allows us to amass pertinent sADR information from a diverse set of data sources {{in order to identify}} and report sADRs in a timely and thorough manner. With increasingly shortened review periods, postmarketing surveillance for sADRs has become very important. In some instances, initial cases are identified at hospital case conferences and reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or to the pharmaceutical manufacturer. The RADAR methodology relies on initial recognition of these “sentinel” cases that then prompts hypothesis-driven inquiries as to whether an unrecognized <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>event</b> signal is present in the population of those exposed to that drug.|$|E
5000|$|Drugs in {{systemic}} circulation have {{a certain}} concentration in the blood, {{which serves as a}} surrogate marker for how much drug will be delivered throughout the body (how much drug {{the rest of the body}} will [...] "see"). There exists a minimum concentration of drug within the blood that will give rise to the intended therapeutic effect (minimum effective concentration, MEC), as well as a minimum concentration of drug that will give rise to an unintended <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>event</b> (minimum toxic concentration, MTC). The difference between these two values is generally referred to as the therapeutic window. Different drugs have different therapeutic windows, and different people will have different MECs and MTCs for a given drug. If someone has a very low MTC for a drug, they are likely to experience adverse effects at drug concentrations lower than what it would take to produce the same adverse effects in the general populace; thus, the individual will experience significant toxicity at a dose that is otherwise considered [...] "normal" [...] for the average person. This individual will be considered [...] "intolerant" [...] to that drug.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} {{incidence}} of and risk factors for <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events</b> in the long-term care setting. METHODS: We performed a cohort study of all long-stay residents of two academic long-term care facilities {{over a period of}} up to 9 months during 2000 to 2001. We assessed the number of <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events,</b> the severity of events (classified as less serious, serious, life threatening, or fatal), and whether the events were preventable. A case-control study was nested within the prospective study to identify resident-level risk factors for the occurrence of <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events.</b> RESULTS: There were 815 <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events,</b> of which 42 % were judged preventable. The overall rate of <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events</b> was 9. 8 per 100 resident-months, with a rate of 4. 1 preventable <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events</b> per 100 resident-months. Errors associated with preventable events occurred most often at the stages of ordering and monitoring. Residents taking medications in several drug categories were at increased risk of a preventable adverse event. In multivariate analyses, the adjusted odds ratio was 3. 4 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 2. 0 to 5. 9) for those taking antipsychotic agents, 2. 8 (95 % CI: 1. 6 to 4. 7) for those taking anticoagulants, 2. 2 (95 % CI: 1. 2 to 4. 0) for those taking diuretics, and 2. 0 (95 % CI: 1. 1 to 3. 7) for those taking antiepileptics. CONCLUSION: Our findings reinforce the need for a special focus on the ordering and monitoring stages of pharmaceutical care for preventing <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events</b> in the long-term care setting. Patients taking antipsychotic agents, anticoagulants, diuretics, and antiepileptics are at increased risk...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Most {{educational}} {{interventions in}} pharmacovigilance {{are designed to}} encourage physicians to report adverse drug reactions. However, multidisciplinary teams may {{play an important role}} in reporting drug-related problems. This study assessed the impact of a multifaceted educational intervention in pharmacovigilance on the knowledge, skills and attitudes of hospital professionals. METHOD: This prospective, open-label, non-randomized study was performed in a medium-complexity hospital in São Paulo, Brazil. The intervention involved four activities: 1) an interactive lecture, 2) a practical class, 3) a pre-post questionnaire administered to professionals on a multidisciplinary team, and 4) educational material. The intervention&# 8217;s impact on the professionals&# 8217; knowledge and skills was assessed using the World Health Organization&# 8217;s definitions. The intervention&# 8217;s effect on the professionals&# 8217; attitudes was analysed by the prevalence of <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>event</b> reports (adverse drug reactions, medication errors, therapeutic failure and drug quality deviations) and the relevance (seriousness and expectancy) of the events. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-three professionals were enrolled. A 70 -fold increase in the number of <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>event</b> reports was observed during the 12 months post-intervention. The intervention improved the professionals&# 8217; form-completion skills (p< 0. 0001) and their knowledge of pharmacovigilance (p< 0. 0001). The intervention also contributed to detecting serious drug-induced events. The nursing staff reported medication errors, and pharmacists and physiotherapists recognized serious adverse drug reactions. Physicians communicated suspicions of therapeutic failure. CONCLUSIONS: A multidisciplinary approach to drug-safety assessments contributes to identifying new, relevant drug-related problems and improving the rate of <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>event</b> reporting.

The study included 1210 older adults with an <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>event.</b> A matched comparison group was randomly selected from enrollees with recent healthcare encounters and medication dispenses. OUTCOME MEASURE: Difference between estimated costs for medical care utilization during the 6 weeks before and 6 weeks beginning on the day of an <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>event.</b> RESULTS: For all adverse drug events, the increase in postevent costs over the preevent period was $ 1310 (95 % confidence interval [CI], $ 625 -$ 1995) greater for those experiencing an <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>event</b> than the comparison group after controlling for age, sex, comorbidity, number of scheduled medications, and having been hospitalized during the preevent period. For preventable adverse drug events, the adjusted increase was $ 1983 (95 % CI, $ 193 -$ 3773) greater for cases.

In this paper, we introduce a visual analytics system {{to solve this problem}} using (1) high scalable interfaces for analyzing correlations between a number of complex variables (e. g., drug and reaction); (2) enhanced statistical computations and interactive relevance filters to quickly identify significant events including those with a low frequency; and (3) a tight integration of expert knowledge for detecting and validating <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events.</b> We applied these techniques to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting Sys-tem and were able to identify important <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events,</b> such as the known association of the drug Avandia with myocardial infarction and Seroquel with diabetes mellitus, as well as low frequency events such as the association of Boniva with femur fracture. In our evaluation, we found over 90 % of the <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events</b> that were published in the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) reports from 2009 to 2012. In addition, our domain expert was able to identify some previously unknown <b>adverse</b> <b>drug</b> <b>events...</b>|$|R
