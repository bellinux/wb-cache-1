25|$|As {{the plan}} was finalized, the United States was to {{transfer}} 180 ships – 30 Tacoma-class patrol frigates (U.S. Navy hull classification symbol PF), 24 Admirable-class minesweepers (AM), 36 <b>auxiliary</b> <b>motor</b> minesweepers (YMS), 30 large infantry landing craft (LCI(L)), 56 submarine chasers (SC), and four floating workshops (YR) – to the Soviet Union by 1 November 1945, training about 15,000 Soviet Navy personnel to operate them. After their commissioning into the Soviet Navy, which would take place at Cold Bay simultaneously with their transfer, the ships would steam {{in a series of}} convoys from Cold Bay with a U.S. Navy escort, passing through Unimak Pass and then moving westward along the northern side of the Aleutian Islands, with smaller vessels which could not make the voyage nonstop – the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>motor</b> minesweepers and submarine chasers – pausing at Adak to refuel and reprovision. Northwest of Attu, the U.S. Navy escort would turn the convoy over to a Soviet Navy escort, and each convoy would then steam north of the Commander Islands to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, from which the transferred ships would disperse to their designated home ports.|$|E
25|$|Despite these difficulties, {{the first}} convoy of {{transferred}} ships – three minesweepers and five <b>auxiliary</b> <b>motor</b> minesweepers – departed Cold Bay for the Soviet Union on 28 May 1945; the second – of three minesweepers and six submarine chasers – departed on 30 May, {{with one of}} its submarine chasers dropping out at Adak for repairs, and the third, made up of three minesweepers and seven submarine chasers, left on 7 June 1945. However, poor repair work and supply problems in Seattle plagued the submarine chaser program, and Maxwell was forced to arrange for submarine chasers assigned to duty in the U.S. Navys 13th Naval District to substitute {{for some of those}} originally scheduled for transfer in order to meet a deadline of having all ships transferred by 1 October 1945.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Navy {{actually}} {{did not want}} to take delivery of many of the Lend-Lease ships because they were no longer useful and would be expensive to take custody of and dispose of; as a result some ships underwent a merely administrative transfer to U.S. custody to meet {{the letter of the law}} and then were sold for scrap in the Soviet Union or destroyed in Soviet waters under the direct observation of American naval authorities. The Soviet Union transferred two <b>auxiliary</b> <b>motor</b> minesweepers to the People's Republic of China, but all of the other 97 Project Hula ships remaining in Soviet hands after the return of the 15 LCI(L)s in 1955 were either sold for scrap in the Soviet Union (81 ships) or (in the case of the other 16 ships) destroyed off its coast, presumably off Nakhodka.|$|E
500|$|The ship's {{greatest}} weakness was her [...] "inability {{to generate}} sufficient electric current {{to power the}} multitude of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>motors</b> on which their advanced machinery and complex gun mountings were dependent. Many of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>motors</b> themselves were also seriously underpowered, particularly the servomotors for the gun mountings (which were slow to train and elevate) and for the rudder (which contributed to the ship's poor maneuverability." ...|$|R

25|$|Subtracting {{the five}} former LCI(L)s lost in combat and an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>motor</b> {{minesweeper}} that sank in 1945, 143 Project Hula ships {{were subject to}} return to the United States. On 7 March 1947, United States Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal presented the United States Department of State with a list of 480 warships that the United States Department of the Navy wanted the Soviet Union to return, including all 28 patrol frigates transferred under Project Hula. In 1948, the Soviet Union finally agreed to return the patrol frigates, and it handed over 27 of them in October and November 1949; the 28th, EK-3, ex-USS Belfast (PF-35), had been driven aground and nearly sunk in a storm off Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky on 17 November 1948, was beyond economical repair, and was never returned, instead being scrapped in the Soviet Union in 1960. Negotiations over the Department of the Navys other major focus, the 25 surviving former LCI(L)s, dragged on longer, but in the end the Soviets returned 15 of them to the United States in 1955. By 1957, the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence reported that of the 149 Project Hula ships, only 18 of those still in Soviet custody – nine minesweepers (AM), five submarine chasers (SC), and the four floating workshops (YR) – remained serviceable.|$|E

2500|$|Material issues also {{arose in}} {{relation}} to the ships themselves. The Bureau of Ships had not heeded Maxwells request to ensure that all ships to be transferred arrived properly equipped, and early in the program every ship arrived at Cold Bay without all authorized equipment or with unauthorized equipment still installed. A great deal of required equipment had to be flown into Fort Randall Army Airfield daily, and some ships had to undergo on-the-spot revisions to their authorized equipment lists. A further difficulty was damage to the wooden-hulled ships – the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>motor</b> minesweepers (YMS) and submarine chasers – in the rough seas in the training area. The closest repair facilities for these ships was nearly [...] away at Dutch Harbor, and an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>motor</b> minesweeper and nine submarine chasers had to visit Dutch Harbor for major repairs, delaying the submarine chaser program by eight days.|$|E
5|$|Arguably the {{greatest}} weakness of these ships lay in {{their inability to}} generate sufficient electric current to power the multitude of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>motors</b> on which their advanced machinery and complex gun mountings were dependent. Their DC electrical supply was only 115V, whereas larger cruisers with power-operated turrets had a 230V system. Electrical power was generated by two Alsthom turbo-generators rated at only 120kW with two small diesel generators rated at 44/52kW for use when the ship was alongside. The latter provided only for the ship's minimum lighting and electricity needs, and fires had to be lit {{in at least one}} of the boilers in order to train the turrets or elevate the guns for practice or maintenance. Many of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>motors</b> themselves were also seriously underpowered, particularly the servomotors for the gun mountings (which were slow to train and elevate) and for the rudder which contributed to the ship's poor maneuverability.

The percentage of bicycles using front lighting had fallen to 51 %, when limiting firstly to the same four measurement locations as used in 1988 (65 %) and in 1993 (54 %). Here, Amsterdam represented the greatest anomaly with a user percentage of 27 %. The number of locations were extended to ten with the latest measurements. For these ten locations (including Amsterdam), the percentage of bicycles that used front lighting was 55 %, while for moped riders and cyclists with <b>auxiliary</b> <b>motors,</b> the figures were 94 % and 91 %, respectively. The operative rear light figures were only a few percent below the front light figures. The rear reflector presence was 94 %.

30|$|Interest in welding {{aluminum}} and copper {{is due to}} the need to optimize the characteristics of high-power electronics systems. Copper provides excellent electrical conductivity, even though it is expensive. Aluminum has good electrical conductivity, is affordable, and lighter than copper. The association of both metals could result in significant cost savings. Moreover, the use in <b>motor</b> vehicles of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>motors</b> and other electronic devices is increasing with the growing popularity of hybrid systems; the cables and cable systems in such arrangements weigh about 15 to 45  kg (Wetzel 2012).

50|$|After {{generators}} and cable, minor amounts of copper {{are used in}} the remaining equipment. In yaw and pitch <b>auxiliary</b> <b>motors,</b> the yaw drive uses a combination of induction motors and multi-stage planetary gearboxes with minor amounts of copper. Power electronics have minimal amounts of copper compared to other equipment. As turbine capacities increase, converter ratings also increase from low voltage (<1kV) to medium voltage (1kV-5kV). Most wind turbines have full power converters, which have the same power rating as the generator, except the DFAG that has a power converter that is 30% of the rating of the generator. Finally, minor amounts of copper are used in air/oil and water cooled circuits on gearboxes or generators.|$|R
