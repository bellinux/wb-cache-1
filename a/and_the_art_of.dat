Modern Chinese scholars explicitly rely on historical strategic lessons <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Art</b> <b>of</b> War in developing their theories, seeing a direct relationship between their modern struggles and those of China in Sun Tzu's time. There is a great perceived value in Sun Tzu's teachings and other traditional Chinese writers, which are used regularly in developing the strategies of the Chinese state and its leaders.|$|E
