50|$|In American law, a signing {{agent or}} {{courtesy}} signer is an agent whose {{function is to}} obtain a formal signature of an <b>appearer</b> to a document.

5000|$|Traditionally, in civil-law countries, the {{preliminary}} drafts, called [...] "minutes" [...] (formerly protocols; Fr minute, Du minuut, It minuta, Ger Urschrift, Sp escritura matriz), are jotted in legal shorthand and record only the particulars. Their date, <b>appearer,</b> venue, and subject are logged in a notarial register, and the minutes are retained {{and kept in}} the notary's protocol (archive) while an engrossment (Fr/Du grosse, It spedizione in forma esecutiva, Ger Ausfertigung, Sp primer testimonio), a fully extended form in long hand under seal and signature, is handed to the <b>appearer.</b> The minutes are used thereafter as a master copy from which exemplifications (Fr expédition, It spedizione, Sp testimonio ulterio, copia simple, Du authentiek afschrift, uitgifte, Ger beglaubigte Abschrift), i.e. engrossed fair copies, may be made. In common-law countries, notaries prepare multiple duplicate originals fully executed and sealed, as a copy would not be admissible in court. One is archived as a file copy in the notary's protocol.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{types of}} {{instruments}} are passed in private form, that is, only one copy—the original—is made and issued to the <b>appearer</b> while the draftsman notary does not retain a copy. Private-form instruments are usually unilateral, have short-term legal effect, and do not benefit third parties, such as certificates of good standing, powers of attorney, certificates of dishonor, statutory declarations, verifications of fact, rent and pay receipts, and pension and annuity arrears documents.|$|E
50|$|Notarial {{instruments}} {{cannot be}} altered or overridden by prior or subsequent instruments under hand (e.g., simple contracts). In other words, for example, a notarial will {{could not be}} amended or superseded by a non-notarial codicil or will. They also estop (preclude) an <b>appearer</b> as contract denier from raising most affirmative defenses as to enforceability, including: (1) non est factum, (2) the contents do not correctly express the appearers' intentions, and (3) defenses against formation (e.g., ultra vires, lack of capacity, improper execution, etc.).|$|E

[...] "The Ghost of Tom Joad" [...] was featured during the 1999-2000 E Street Band Reunion Tour, in arrangement fairly close to the album's, albeit with Federici often playing accordion and Tallent on stand-up bass. In the U.S., the large arena audiences frequently treated the song's appearance as the signal for a bathroom or beer run. The song became an infrequent <b>appearer</b> after that, perhaps surprisingly only showing twice on the 2005 solo Devils & Dust Tour.|$|E
50|$|For the {{purposes}} of authentication, most countries require commercial or personal documents which originate from or are signed in another country to be notarized {{before they can be}} used or officially recorded or before they can have any legal effect. To these documents a notary affixes a notarial certificate which attests to the execution of the document, usually by the person who appears before the notary, known as an <b>appearer</b> or constituent (U.S.). In places where lawyer notaries are the norm, a notary may also draft legal instruments known as notarial acts or deeds which have probative value and executory force, as they do in civil law jurisdictions. Originals or secondary originals are then filed and stored in the notary's archives, or protocol.|$|E
50|$|As {{a youngster}} Sean played for Top of the Hill Celtic F.C. in the Derry and District League.As he got older {{he broke into}} the Derry City team in the {{position}} of striker and scored a hat trick on his debut. Hargan later converted to left back, where he offers total commitment to the side. This has endeared him to the fans. Hargan has scored more than 50 competitive goals for the Candystripes, including a decisive header away to IFK Gothenburg in the 2006 UEFA Cup qualifying round. Also during the 2006 league season, Derry City escaped punishment for fielding a banned Hargan due to the league failing informing Derry City in the correct timeframe. By the end of that season, Hargan had made a total of 393 appearances for the club - that makes him the club's third highest <b>appearer</b> ever. Hargan was described as a great servant for the club and is mostly remembered for the goal he scored in the Europa League against IFK Gothenburg which saw Derry to a 1-0 victory on the night. After Derry's City's European experience, Shelbourne were reported to have showen interest in the left back, but Hargan pledged his loyalty and stayed with the Candystripes {{until the end of the}} 2008 season.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, {{notarial}} instruments {{trigger a}} præsumptio veritatis et solemnitatis entailing two consequences—regularity and probativity. First, being an official act, a {{presumption of regularity}} attaches to the instrument, meaning all prescribed formalities have been carried out, including the reading over of the instrument. Second, a notarial instrument is self-authenticating and probative, i.e., it constitutes full proof of the agreement it contains, as against the parties, their heirs, and successors. It also means the notary's firsthand (ex propriis sensibus) narrations of fact are conclusively presumed true and correct, whereas secondhand narrations (appearers' representations) are merely assertio notarii which are rebuttably presumed valid. While all notarial instruments are official documents, they are not all necessarily public; most instruments are in public form, meaning an original is retained in publica custodia by the notary {{in his or her}} protocol or recorded with a public registry, but some are in private form, that is, a single original is issued directly to the appearer(s). In either case, the <b>appearer</b> always walks away with an instrument that is self-executing, that is, it requires no further implementing action to be effective and enforceable, just like a court order. Finally, notarial instruments have a fixed effective or signature date (data certa) that cannot be ante- or postdated, or left blank and filled in after signing.|$|E
