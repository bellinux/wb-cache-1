25|$|Admiral Linois is a French admiral whom Jack Aubrey first {{encounters}} in Master and Commander when the Sophie is taken by his squadron in the Mediterranean. Later, after Aubrey has been paroled, Linois and his ships {{are involved in}} Sir James Saumarez's battle against a combined French and Spanish fleet in the Gut of Gibraltar. In HMS Surprise Jack, {{with the assistance of}} a fleet of armed merchant ships belonging to the British East India Company, fights against Linois' squadron, taking the Surprise into a yardarm to yardarm battle (a cannon duel at <b>almost</b> <b>touching</b> range) against Linois' 74 gun ship of the line, the Marengo.|$|E
25|$|The huipil is a tunic-like garment made by {{stitching}} together anywhere {{from one to}} five pieces of cloth. The most common fiber is cotton, but there are those made from wool and silk as well. Most huipils are made from two or three pieces, which are usually the same size, with one exception being those from the highlands of Chiapas, where the center piece is wider than the side ones. The panels are not sewn together in the normal sense with seams but rather they are joined using ribbons, small strips of cloth or complicated stitching which has {{the edges of the}} panels touching or <b>almost</b> <b>touching.</b> This adds a layer of decoration to the garment.|$|E

500|$|The set {{containing}} Sterling Cooper's corporate offices contained skypans {{fitted with}} 5K bulbs onto the centers, which measured 8inches apart. Ambrose {{collaborated with the}} production team to institute twenty-five inch trusses on chain motors and to devise dollys with Arri Alexa cameras that were eventually installed on aluminum I-beams. Ambrose proclaimed that {{the flexibility of the}} trolleys and chain motors enabled production to move more efficiently in concentrating on the design of the window. He added: [...] "We also had four 20Ks and a few more T-12s on stands that could be rolled around the office floor. For tungsten close-ups, we often used Barger-Baglite six- and three-light units with Chimeras, soft cloth, diaper baffles and 60- and 90-degree honeycomb grids for control." [...] In comparison, Ambrose used traditional lighting when creating the housing for the character, as he favored the color spectrum of a household lightbulb. For example, Don's home required four to five rooms to be lit simultaneously. [...] "We used a lot of batten strips with 100-watt household bulbs," [...] noted Ambrose. [...] "The bulbs are so close they're <b>almost</b> <b>touching,</b> so they create a single source that doesn't cast multiple shadows. Over time, we built housings for them with channels into which you can slide diffusion frames or egg crates. We call them 'Whiteys' because the guy who knocked these shells out of tin back in New York was named Whitey; I used them extensively on The Sopranos and felt they suited the homes in Mad Men as well." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some prisoners claim von Braun {{engaged in}} brutal {{treatment}} or approved of it. Guy Morand, a French resistance fighter {{who was a}} prisoner in Dora, testified in 1995 that after an apparent sabotage attempt, von Braun ordered a prisoner to be flogged, while Robert Cazabonne, another French prisoner, claimed von Braun stood by as prisoners were hanged by chains suspended by cranes. However, these accounts {{may have been a}} case of mistaken identity. Former Buchenwald inmate Adam Cabala claims that von Braun went to the concentration camp to pick slave laborers: [...] the German scientists led by Prof. Wernher von Braun were aware of everything daily. As they went along the corridors, they saw the exhaustion of the inmates, their arduous work and their pain. Not one single time did Prof. Wernher von Braun protest against this cruelty and bestiality during his frequent stays at Dora. Even the aspect of corpses did not touch him: On a small area near the ambulance shed, inmates tortured to death by slave labor and the terror of the overseers were piling up daily. [...] But, Prof. Wernher von Braun passed them so close that he was <b>almost</b> <b>touching</b> the corpses".|$|E

2500|$|The {{painting}} received {{mixed reviews}} from critics and commentators {{on both sides}} of the Atlantic. The novelist and Biographer PaulAlexis commented equivocally, ‘This is a false Puvis de Chavannes. What funny male and female [...] bathers! But it is painted with so much conviction that it appears <b>almost</b> <b>touching</b> and I don’t quite dare poke fun at it.’ In L’Intransigeant, Edmond Bazire, writing under the pseudonym ‘Edmond Jacques’, wrote, ‘behind and under some prismatic eccentricities Seurat conceals the most distinguished qualities of draughtsmanship, and envelops his bathing men, his ripples, his horizons in warm tones.’ Both Jules Claretie and Roger Marx also described the painting as being a noteworthy ‘Impressionist’ painting. The Art Amateur’s anonymous reviewer of the New York exhibition—who even explicitly likened Bathers at Asnières to Italian fresco painting—, also called the picture a modern ‘Impressionist’ work. PaulSignac remarked that the Bathers was painted ‘… n great flat strokes, brushed one over the other, fed by a palette composed, like Delacroix’s, of pure and earthy colours. By means of these ochres and browns the picture was deadened and appeared less brilliant than the works the impressionists painted with a palette limited to prismatic colours. But the understanding of the laws of contrast, the methodical separation of elements—light, shade, local colour, and the interaction of colours—as well as their proper balance and proportion gave this canvas its perfect harmony.’ ...|$|E
