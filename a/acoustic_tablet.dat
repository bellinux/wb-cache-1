50|$|An <b>acoustic</b> <b>tablet,</b> {{also known}} as a spark tablet, is a form of {{graphics}} tablet that uses sound to locate the position of the stylus within the drawing area.|$|E
50|$|The <b>acoustic</b> <b>tablet,</b> or spark tablet, used a stylus that {{generated}} clicks with a spark plug. The clicks were then triangulated {{by a series}} of microphones to locate the pen in space. The system was fairly complex and expensive, and the sensors were susceptible to interference by external noise.|$|E
50|$|<b>Acoustic</b> <b>tablets</b> {{have a long}} {{technological}} history, as {{seen from}} this 1971 patent by Science Accessories Corporation. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>tablets</b> are a convenient {{way to make a}} digitizing tablet for a very large surface area, as in the products.|$|R
5000|$|The general {{functionality}} of <b>acoustic</b> <b>tablets</b> {{is based}} on a sound-emitting stylus and microphones that are used to record the sound. The current position of the stylus can be calculated according to the difference in the timing of the recorded sound. The sound can, for example, be a small electrical discharge that is emitted when the stylus is placed near the surface of the tablet.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of tablet porosity and particle size fraction of compacted Starch acetate powders, with and without model drug caffeine, on <b>acoustic</b> properties of <b>tablets.</b> The ultrasound velocity was determined from the transmission measurements. Tablets of starch acetate (SA DS 2. 7) powder with two particle size fractions of 0 – 53 and 0 – 710  μm were compressed with a compaction simulator. Porosities of tablets varied in the range from 12 % to 43 % for both particle size fractions. Strong associations were found between the ultrasound velocity and physical properties of the tablets such as porosity and particle size fraction. Interestingly, ultrasound velocity was practically insensitive to inclusion of the model drug caffeine with the concentrations used. Based on this study ultrasound transmission method is a potential non-destructive tool for studying structural changes of tablets and other solid dosage forms...|$|R
