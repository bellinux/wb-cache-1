500|$|Tres Zapotes MonumentA (also {{known as}} Tres Zapotes Colossal Head1) {{was the first}} colossal head to be found, {{discovered}} by accident {{in the middle of}} the nineteenth century, [...] to the north of the modern village of Tres Zapotes. After its discovery it remained half-buried until it was excavated by Matthew Stirling in 1939. At some point it was moved to the plaza of the modern village, probably in the early 1960s. It has since been moved to the Museo Comunitario de Tres Zapotes. Monument A stands [...] tall; it measures [...] wide by [...] deep, and is estimated to weigh 7.8 tons. The head is sculpted with a simple headdress with a wide band that is otherwise unadorned, and wears rectangular ear ornaments that project forwards onto the cheeks. The face is carved with deep creases between the cheeks and the nose and around the mouth; the forehead is creased into <b>a</b> <b>frown.</b> The upper lip has suffered recent damage, with the left portion flaking away.|$|E

500|$|La Venta Monument4 {{measures}} [...] high by [...] {{wide and}} [...] deep. It weighs 19.8 tons. It was {{found a few}} metres {{to the west of}} Monument2 and has been moved to the Parque-Museo La Venta. As with the other heads in the group, its archaeological context has been radiocarbon dated to between 1000 and 600 BC. The headdress is elaborate and, although damaged, various details are still discernible. The base of the headdress is formed by three horizontal strips running over the forehead. One side is decorated with a double-disc motif that may have been repeated on the other; if so, damage to the right side has obliterated any trace of it. The top of the headdress is decorated with the clawed foot of a bird of prey. Either straps or plaits of hair descend {{on either side of the}} face, from the headdress to the base of the monument. Only one earspool survives; it is flat, in the form of a rounded square, and is decorated with a cross motif. The ears have been completely eroded away and the lips are damaged. The surviving features display <b>a</b> <b>frown</b> and creasing around the nose and cheeks. The head displays prominent teeth.|$|E
500|$|San Lorenzo Colossal Head8 (also {{known as}} San Lorenzo Monument61) stands [...] high; it {{measures}} [...] wide by [...] deep and weighs 13 tons. It {{is one of}} the finest examples of an Olmec colossal head. It was found lying on its side to the south of a monumental throne. The monument was discovered at a depth of [...] during a magnetometer survey of the site in 1968; it has been dated to the Early Preclassic. After discovery it was initially reburied; it was moved to the Museo de Antropología de Xalapa in 1986. The headdress is decorated with the talons or claws of either a jaguar or an eagle. It has a headband and a cover that descends from under the headdress proper behind the ears. Two short straps descend in front of the ears. The head sports large ear ornaments in the form of pegs. The face is that of a mature male with sagging cheeks and wrinkles between these and the nose. The forehead is gathered in <b>a</b> <b>frown.</b> The mouth is slightly parted to reveal the teeth. Most of the head is carved in a realistic manner, the exception being the ears. These are stylised and represented by one question mark shape contained within another. The head is very well preserved and displays a fine finish.|$|E
500|$|San Lorenzo Colossal Head6 (also {{known as}} San Lorenzo Monument17) {{is one of}} the smaller {{examples}} of colossal heads, standing [...] It measures [...] wide by [...] deep and is estimated to weigh between 8 and 10 tons. The head was discovered by a local farmworker and was excavated in 1965 by Luis Aveleyra and Román Piña Chan. The head had collapsed into a ravine under its own weight and was found face down on its left hand side. In 1970 it was transported to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York for the museum's centenary exhibition. After its return to Mexico, it was placed in the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico City. It is sculpted with a net-like head covering joined together with sculpted beads. A covering descends from under the headdress to cover the back half of the neck. The headband is divided into four strips and begins above the right ear, extending around the entire head. A short strap descends from either side of the head to the ear. The ear ornaments are complex and are larger {{at the front of the}} ear than at the back. The face is that of an ageing male with the forehead creased in <b>a</b> <b>frown,</b> wrinkles under the eyes, sagging cheeks and deep creases on either side of the nose. The face is somewhat asymmetric, possibly due to errors in the execution of the monument.|$|E

500|$|San Lorenzo Colossal Head5 is {{also known}} as San Lorenzo Monument5. The {{monument}} stands [...] high and measures [...] wide by [...] deep. It weighs 11.6 tons. The head was discovered by Matthew Stirling in 1946, face down in a gully to the south of the principal mound. The head is particularly well executed and is likely to have been found close to its original location. Ceramics recovered during its excavation became mixed with those from the excavation of Head4. The mixed ceramics have been dated to the San Lorenzo and Villa Alta phases (approximately 1400–1000 BC and 800–1000 AD respectively). Colossal Head5 is particularly well preserved, although the back of the headdress band was damaged when the head was moved from the archaeological site. The band of the headdress is set at an angle and has a notch above the bridge of the nose. The headdress is decorated with jaguar paws; this general identification of the decoration is contested by Beatriz de la Fuente since the [...] "paws" [...] have three claws each; she identifies them as the claws of a bird of prey. At the back of the head, ten interlaced strips form a net decorated with disc motifs. Two short straps descend from the headdress in front of the ears. The ears are adorned with disc-shaped earspools with pegs. The face is that of an ageing man with wrinkles under the eyes and across the bridge of the nose, and a forehead that is creased in <b>a</b> <b>frown.</b> The lips are slightly parted. Colossal Head5 has been moved to the Museo de Antropología de Xalapa.|$|E
500|$|San Lorenzo Colossal Head1 (also {{known as}} San Lorenzo Monument1) was lying facing upwards when excavated. The erosion of a path passing {{on top of}} the {{monument}} uncovered its eye and led to the discovery of the Olmec site. Colossal Head1 is [...] high; it measures [...] wide and it weighs 25.3 tons. The monument was discovered partially buried {{at the edge of a}} gully by Matthew Stirling in 1945. When discovered it was lying on its back, looking upwards. It was associated with a large number of broken ceramic vessels and figurines. The majority of these ceramic remains have been dated to between 800 and 400 BC; some pieces have been dated to the Villa Alta phase (Late Classic period, 800–1000 AD). The headdress possesses a plain band that is tied at the back of the head. The upper portion of the headdress is decorated with a U-shaped motif. This element descends across the front of the headdress, terminating on the forehead. On the front portion it is decorated with five semicircular motifs. The scalp piece does not meet the horizontal band, leaving a space between the two pieces. On each side of the face a strap descends from the headdress and passes in front of the ear. The forehead is wrinkled in <b>a</b> <b>frown.</b> The lips are slightly parted without revealing the teeth. The cheeks are pronounced and the ears are particularly well executed. The face is slightly asymmetric, which may be due to error on the part of the sculptors or may accurately reflect the physical features of the portrait's subject. The head has been moved to the Museo de Antropología de Xalapa ("Anthropological Museum of Xalapa").|$|E
500|$|San Lorenzo Colossal Head2 (also {{known as}} San Lorenzo Monument2) was {{reworked}} from a monumental throne. The head stands [...] high and measures [...] wide by [...] deep; it weighs 20 tons. Colossal Head2 {{was discovered in}} 1945 when Matthew Stirling's guide cleared {{away some of the}} vegetation and mud that covered it. The monument was found lying on its back, facing the sky, and was excavated in 1946 by Stirling and Philip Drucker. In 1962 the monument was removed from the San Lorenzo plateau in order to put it on display as part of [...] "The Olmec tradition" [...] exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston in 1963. San Lorenzo Colossal Head2 is currently in the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico City. The head was associated with a number of ceramic finds; they have been dated to the Early Preclassic and Late Classic periods. Colossal Head2 wears a complex headdress that sports a horizontal band tied {{at the back of the}} head; this is decorated with three bird's heads that are located above the forehead and temples. The scalp piece is formed from six strips running towards the back of the head. The front of the headdress above the horizontal band is plain. Two short straps hang down from the headdress in front of the ears. The ear jewellery is formed by large squared hoops or framed discs. The left and right ornaments are different, with radial lines on the left earflare, a feature absent on the right earflare. The head is badly damaged due to an unfinished reworking process. This process has pitmarked the entire face with at least 60 smaller hollows and 2 larger holes. The surviving features appear to depict an ageing man with the forehead creased into <b>a</b> <b>frown.</b> The lips are thick and slightly parted to reveal the teeth; the head has a pronounced chin.|$|E

[...] Deford later wrote the following about Cappon:"In a profession in which men are renowned for their behavior during a basketball game, Cappy Cappon stood quite by himself among coaches. Until the game was over, the man never did anything but frown. There were degrees of frowning, of course, but his gamut of expression seldom ventured too far {{from that of a}} basic frown.
