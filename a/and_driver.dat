5|$|As {{part of the}} deal, Smythe {{resigned}} as president and managing director, nominating Stafford to succeed him.

Stafford, Ballard and Bassett then nominated Smythe as chairman of the board. Smythe retired as NHL governor on February 5, 1962, a position he had held since 1927. Smythe resigned the chairmanship after Toronto won the Stanley Cup in 1962 and Bassett succeeded him.|$|E

5|$|June 20, 1998: A Greyhound bus on a {{scheduled}} trip from New York City to Pittsburgh ran off a road near Burnt Cabins, Pennsylvania, {{and hit a}} truck parked in an emergency parking area. Six passengers and the driver died. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of the accident was the driver's use of a sedating antihistamine <b>and</b> <b>driver</b> fatigue, due to an irregular work-rest schedule.|$|E

The ambulance was escorted to Claremorris railway station, where Boycott and his family boarded a train to Dublin, where Boycott was received with some hostility. The hotel he stayed in received letters saying that it would be boycotted if Boycott remained. He had intended to stay in Dublin for a week, but Boycott was advised to cut his stay short. He left Dublin for England on the Holyhead mail boat on 1 December.|$|E

5|$|The LS 400 {{was praised}} for its quietness, {{well-appointed}} and ergonomic interior, engine performance, build quality, aerodynamics, fuel economy and value. However, it was criticized by some automobile columnists for derivative styling and a suspension regarded as too compromising of handling for ride comfort. In some markets it was priced against mid-size, six-cylinder Mercedes-Benz and BMW models. It was rated by Car <b>and</b> <b>Driver</b> magazine as {{better than the}} higher-priced Mercedes-Benz 420 SEL and BMW 735i in terms of ride, handling and performance. The LS 400 also won motoring awards from automotive publications including Automobile Magazine and Wheels Magazine. Lexus quickly established customer loyalty and its debut was generally regarded {{as a shock to}} existing luxury marques. BMW's and Mercedes-Benz's U.S. sales figures dropped 29 percent and 19 percent, respectively, with BMW executives accusing Lexus of dumping in that market, while 35 percent of Lexus buyers traded in a Lincoln or Cadillac.|$|E
5|$|The chariots {{themselves}} were modified war chariots, essentially wooden carts with two wheels {{and an open}} back, although chariots were by this time no longer used in battle. The charioteer's feet were held in place, but the cart rested on the axle, so the ride was bumpy. The most exciting part of the chariot race, {{at least for the}} spectators, was the turns at the ends of the hippodrome. These turns were very dangerous and often deadly. If a chariot had not already been knocked over by an opponent before the turn, it might be overturned or crushed (along with the horses <b>and</b> <b>driver)</b> by the other chariots as they went around the post. Deliberately running into an opponent to cause him to crash was technically illegal, but nothing could be done about it (at Patroclus' funeral games, Antilochus in fact causes Menelaus to crash in this way,) and crashes were likely to happen by accident anyway.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} was then deployed in defensive operations against massed Soviet attacks. From 26 August to 15 September the division repulsed five attacks of divisional strength and a further 85 attacks of battalion strength. The heaviest combat occurred on 26 August near Bespalovka and on 28 August, when the division halted a Soviet breakthrough at Bol'shaya Gomol'sha. Fegelein led a counterattack on 8 September, recapturing the height 199,0 at Verkhniy Bishkin. On 11 September 1943, during these defensive battles, {{he was awarded}} the Close Combat Clasp in bronze. Fegelein was severely wounded on 30 September 1943 and was hospitalised for a few weeks. He received the German Cross in gold on 1 November 1943. Following his convalescence he was appointed chief of Amt VI—Office for Rider <b>and</b> <b>Driver</b> Training—in the SS-Führungshauptamt on 1 January 1944.|$|E

5|$|The {{night after}} the Miami Showband massacre, gunmen opened fire on a minibus near Gilford. It had been {{travelling}} from Banbridge to Bleary with nine people on board; all were Catholics and most had been returning from a regular bingo session. One report says it was stopped at a fake British Army checkpoint. Five Catholic civilians were shot; passenger Joseph Toland was killed outright <b>and</b> <b>driver</b> James Marks died of his wounds in January 1976. The attack was blamed on loyalists and Lost Lives—an account of every death in the conflict—states that reliable loyalist sources have confirmed the UVF was responsible. However, police have blamed the IRA. The RUC suggested the IRA had meant to attack a police minibus in revenge for the Miami killings, but had mistakenly attacked a civilian minibus instead. A report by the police's Historical Enquiries Team (HET) also suggests this. The IRA has denied responsibility.|$|E
5|$|The problem {{occurred}} {{because of the}} way the vehicles were modified for right-hand-drive. The investigation showed that although the brake pedal had been moved to the right, it was still connected to a mechanism on the passenger side. This was covered by felt carpet and meant that both the front passenger <b>and</b> <b>driver</b> could activate the brakes. A further investigation by Watchdog later found the same problem in other Citroën models and some vehicles produced by Renault and Peugeot, some of which were registered in 2002. All three manufacturers worked with the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) to identify the severity of the problem but no vehicles were found to be affected enough to issue recalls.|$|E
5|$|The raid was {{preceded by}} the escape of seven POWs on 30 August 1944. The organisers of the escape were Private Ralph Frederick Churches, an Australian Army {{infantry}} soldier of the 2/48th Battalion {{who had been on}} temporary duty with Headquarters ANZAC Corps when he was captured during the Allied withdrawal from Greece in April–May 1941, <b>and</b> <b>Driver</b> Leslie Arthur Laws, a British Army soldier of the 127th (Dorset) Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, Royal Engineers. By August 1944, Churches had already attempted to escape on two occasions and had learned about the surroundings from those experiences. He realised that he had to escape while the prisoners were in an environment hostile to the Germans. Churches had learned to speak passable German during his captivity, and had been the camp leader of the work camp for eighteen months when he resigned the role so he could be involved in the escape.|$|E
