United was required to reimburse the city 50 percent of the excess (although the club's commitment was capped at $10 million). The club was also barred from playing more than an occasional home game away from the Buzzard Point stadium, prohibiting the team from relocating during the term of the lease.

There are certain categories of <b>agreement</b> which cannot amount to a criminal conspiracy, however; an <b>agreement</b> between a husband and wife is not a conspiracy, under section 2(2)(a) of the 1977 Act, and neither is an <b>agreement</b> with a person under the age of criminal responsibility, or with the intended victim of the crime.|$|E
5|$|Thanks {{to popular}} support within Poland, {{as well as}} to {{international}} support and media coverage, the Gdańsk workers held out until the government gave in to their demands. On August 21 a Governmental Commission (Komisja Rządowa) including Mieczysław Jagielski arrived in Gdańsk, and another one with Kazimierz Barcikowski was dispatched to Szczecin. On August 30 and 31, and on September 3, representatives of the workers and the government signed an <b>agreement</b> ratifying many of the workers' demands, including the right to strike. This <b>agreement</b> {{came to be known as}} the August or Gdańsk <b>agreement</b> (Porozumienia sierpniowe). Other agreements were signed in Szczecin (the Szczecin <b>Agreement</b> of August 30), and Jastrzębie-Zdrój on September 3. It was called the Jastrzębie <b>Agreement</b> (Porozumienia jastrzebskie) and as such is regarded as part of the Gdańsk <b>agreement.</b> Though concerned with labor-union matters, the <b>agreement</b> enabled citizens to introduce democratic changes within the communist political structure and was regarded as a first step toward dismantling the Party's monopoly of power. The workers' main concerns were the establishment of a labor union independent of communist-party control, and recognition of a legal right to strike. Workers' needs would now receive clear representation. Another consequence of the Gdańsk <b>Agreement</b> was the replacement, in September 1980, of Edward Gierek by Stanisław Kania as Party First Secretary.|$|E

The <b>agreement</b> was also unfavourable for Croatia because it was left to defend against the JNA and Serb forces. By effectively removing Slovenia from influence of the federal authorities, especially the JNA, the <b>agreement</b> fulfilled one of the Serbian nationalists' goals, allowing the redrawing of international borders. Sabrina Ramet noted that Kučan and Milošević reached an <b>agreement</b> in January 1991 in which Milošević gave his assurances that Slovenia's independence bid would not be opposed by Serbia. In return, Kučan expressed his understanding for Milošević's interest to create a Greater Serbia.|$|E
