The rate constant for interfacial electron transfer is very small, probably reflecting the absence of low energy sites for stabilisation of the intermediate, in the two-electron reduction of H+ to H- 2.

The exploration successes of large gas field of Cambrian Longwangmiao Formation in Gaoshiti-Moxi region, Central Sichuan Basin, indicated that prospective sedimentary facies belt {{was the basis for}} the formation of large gas fields. In this paper, based on seismic data, outcrop data and drilling data, the tectonic framework and sedimentary features of the Middle Permian in the SW Sichuan Basin were comprehensively studied. The following conclusions were reached from the perspective of sedimentary facies control: (1) during the Middle Permian, this region was in shallow water gentle slope belts with high energy, where thick reef flat facies were deposited; (2) the basement was uplifted during Middle Permian, resulting in the unconformity weathering crust at the top of Maokou Formation due to erosion; the SW Sichuan Basin was located in the karst slope belt, where epigenic karstification was intense; and (3) reef flat deposits superimposed by karst weathering crust was favorable for the formation of large-scale reef flat karst reservoirs. Based on the combination of the resources <b>conditions</b> and hydrocarbon <b>accumulation</b> <b>conditions</b> in this region, it was pointed out that the Middle Permian has great potential of large-scale reef flat karst gas reservoir due to its advantageous geological conditions; the Middle Permian traps with good hydrocarbon <b>accumulation</b> <b>conditions</b> were developed in the Longmen Mountain front closed structural belt in the SW Sichuan Basin and Western Sichuan Basin depression slope belt, which are favorable targets for large-scale reef flat karst reservoirs...|$|R

The fluid pressure increased by hydrocarbon generation was 0.7  MPa to 12.7  MPa with an average of 5.4  MPa in the late accumulation period. Using the minimum accumulation dynamics of 0.7  MPa, the maximum cutoff-value for permeability in the accumulation period at a formation temperature of 125  °C was calculated to be 0.203  ×  10 − 3  μm 2. Using the maximum accumulation dynamics of 12.7  MPa, the minimum cutoff-value for permeability in the accumulation period at a formation temperature of 125  °C is calculated to be 0.001  ×  10 − 3  μm 2. So, at the high level of accumulation dynamics hydrocarbon can accumulate in all studied reservoirs. Reservoirs with diagenetic facies A and diagenetic facies B do not develop <b>accumulation</b> <b>conditions</b> at the low level of accumulation dynamics, because the permeability of reservoirs with diagenetic facies A and diagenetic facies B is lower than the maximum cutoff value. The surplus pressure is 1.3 – 16.2  MPa with an average of 6.6  MPa. Using the minimum accumulation dynamics 1.3  MPa, the maximum cutoff-value for permeability in the accumulation period at a formation temperature of 125  °C was calculated to be 0.066  ×  10 − 3  μm 2. Using the maximum accumulation dynamics 16.2  MPa, the minimum cutoff-value for permeability in the accumulation period at a formation temperature of 125  °C was calculated to be 0.0007  ×  10 − 3  μm 2.

However, the previous studies scarcely focused on the controlling effects of tectonic differentiation on the formation of large oil and gas fields in the ancient craton basins.

In this paper, based on the research results of the Sinian–Triassic prototype basin and lithofacies paleogeography of the Sichuan Basin, the tectonic differentiation pattern of craton basins and its controls on the accumulation elements and the distribution of hydrocarbons were analyzed with reference to the concept that structures control the sedimentation and distribution of oil and gas. The study reveals the results in three aspects. First, the intra-cratonic graben controls the high-quality source rocks and the hydrocarbon generation center, which forms good source-reservoir assemblage with the high-quality reservoir in the platform margin at the flank, showing excellent near-source <b>accumulation</b> <b>conditions.</b> Second, the three types of paleo-uplifts (i. e. differential denudation, syn-sedimentary, and folding) and the deep-large faults developed in the craton are favorable for the formation and distribution of large-scale carbonate reservoirs.

First, the deep-water area located in the southern and central parts of the Qiongdongnan Basin was formed {{under the control of}} such tectonic events as Indosinian–Eurasian Plate collision, Himalayan uplifting and South China Sea expansion, and experienced Paleogene lift and Neogene depression stages. Second, accompanied by lacustrine deposition, faulting activity was violent in Eocene; whereas in Early Oligocene, rift continued to develop under a sedimentary environment of marine–terrestrial transitional facies and littoral-neritic facies. Third, oil generation predominated Eocene lacustrine mudstone and gas generation predominated Lower Oligocene marine–terrestrial transitional facies coal-measure strata compose two sets of major source rocks. Fourth, analysis in respect of thermal evolution level, hydrocarbon generation volume and hydrocarbon generation intensity shows that Ledong, Lingshui, Baodao and Changchang sags belong to potential hydrocarbon-rich kitchens, among which Ledong and Lingshui sags have been proved to have great hydrocarbon generation potential by drilling.

40|$|According to a proposal, a {{silicon dioxide}} {{layer in a}} high-speed, low-power, silicon- based {{electro-optical}} modulator would {{be replaced by a}} layer of lead zirconate titanate or other ferroelectric oxide material. The purpose of this modification is to enhance the power performance and functionality of the modulator. In its unmodified form, the particular silicon- based electro-optical modulator is of an advanced design that overcomes the speed limitation of prior silicon-based electro- optical modulators. Whereas modulation frequencies of such devices had been limited to about 20 MHz, this modulator can operate at modulation frequencies as high as 1 GHz. This modulator can be characterized as a silicon-waveguide-based metal oxide/semiconductor (MOS) capacitor phase shifter in which modulation of the index of refraction in silicon is obtained by exploiting the free-charge-carrier-plasma dispersion effect. As shown in the figure, the modulator includes an n-doped crystalline silicon slab (the silicon layer of a silicon- on-insulator wafer) and a p-doped polycrystalline silicon rib with a gate oxide layer (the aforementioned silicon dioxide layer) sandwiched between them. Under <b>accumulation</b> <b>conditions,</b> the majority charge carriers in the silicon waveguide modify the index of refraction so that a phase shift is induced in the optical mode propagating in the waveguide.

First, the deep-water area located in the southern and central parts of the Qiongdongnan Basin was formed {{under the control of}} such tectonic events as Indosinian–Eurasian Plate collision, Himalayan uplifting and South China Sea expansion, and experienced Paleogene lift and Neogene depression stages. Second, accompanied by lacustrine deposition, faulting activity was violent in Eocene; whereas in Early Oligocene, rift continued to develop under a sedimentary environment of marine–terrestrial transitional facies and littoral-neritic facies. Third, oil generation predominated Eocene lacustrine mudstone and gas generation predominated Lower Oligocene marine–terrestrial transitional facies coal-measure strata compose two sets of major source rocks. Fourth, analysis in respect of thermal evolution level, hydrocarbon generation volume and hydrocarbon generation intensity shows that Ledong, Lingshui, Baodao and Changchang sags belong to potential hydrocarbon-rich kitchens, among which Ledong and Lingshui sags have been proved to have great hydrocarbon generation potential by drilling. Fifth, researches of deep-water sedimentology and hydrocarbon accumulation dynamics reveal that Paleogene and Neogene plays are developed vertically, and favorable hydrocarbon accumulation zones like the Central Canyon lithologic trap zone (group), Changchang circum-sag trap zone (group) and southern Baodao fault terrace zone are developed horizontally in the area. Sixth, with its excellent petroleum <b>accumulation</b> <b>conditions</b> and great exploration potential, the Central Canyon lithologic trap zone should be taken as the preferred drilling target, which has been verified correct by the discovery of the Central Canyon Gas Field — the largest gas field in the northern South China Sea...|$|R
40|$|Channel {{initiation}} {{is caused}} by a combination of various hydrogeomorphic processes. In the humid temperate zone of the Polish Plain, in areas with permeable deposits, seepage erosion is the primary mechanism of stream channel initiation. In the 24 channel heads selected {{in the southern part of}} the Parsęta catchment (NW Poland), the zones of occurrence of the following processes were identified: (1) seepage erosion; (2) falls, dry ravel events and slides; (3) creep, solifluction, surface runoff and erosion; (4) channel processes; and (5) landforms created under the impact of plants and animals. The co-occurrence of various morphogenetic processes produces variations in the <b>accumulation</b> <b>conditions,</b> and as a result, a diversity of deposits. Channel heads morphology shows the effect of the topography of the zero-discharge catchment, the type and magnitude of groundwater outflows, the variability of the geological structure, and the possibility of material being removed from the alcoves...|$|R
