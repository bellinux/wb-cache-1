5|$|After rising {{tensions}} with Mexico following the United States' annexation of Texas, {{war broke out}} in 1846. During the conflict, Grant distinguished himself as a daring <b>and</b> <b>competent</b> soldier. Before the war, President John Tyler had ordered Grant's unit to Louisiana {{as part of the}} Army of Observation under Major General Zachary Taylor. In September 1846, Tyler's successor, James K. Polk, unable to provoke Mexico into war at Corpus Christi, Texas, ordered Taylor to march 150 miles south to the Rio Grande. Marching south to Fort Texas, to prevent a Mexican siege, Grant experienced combat {{for the first time on}} May 8, 1846, at the Battle of Palo Alto.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Harclay was richly {{rewarded for}} his loyal <b>and</b> <b>competent</b> {{performance}} at Boroughbridge. On 15 March he was created Earl of Carlisle, and promised lands worth 1000 marks yearly. Yet Harclay, {{who had turned}} down Lancaster's overtures {{to join in the}} rebellion, was no great adherent of the King. As a warden of the Scottish Marches he grew constantly more frustrated with the King's idleness, and eventually negotiated a peace treaty with the Scots. This action on Harclay's part amounted to treason, and early in 1323 he was apprehended by the King's men, and hanged, drawn and quartered.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the guise}} of {{reinforcing}} the Spanish armies, 23,000 French troops entered Spain unopposed in November 1807. Even when their intentions became clear the following February, the occupying forces faced little resistance besides isolated actions in disconnected areas. In 1808, a popular uprising—incited by Ferdinand's supporters—saw Godoy captured and left Charles with {{no choice but to}} abdicate; he did so on 19 March 1808, allowing his son to ascend the throne as FerdinandVII. Ferdinand had been seeking French patronage, but Napoleon and his principal commander, Marshal Joachim Murat, believed that Spain would benefit from rulers who were more progressive <b>and</b> <b>competent</b> than the Bourbons. They decided that Napoleon's brother, Joseph Bonaparte, should be king. Under a pretext of mediation, Napoleon summoned Charles and Ferdinand to Bayonne, France, where they were coerced into relinquishing their rights to the throne in favour of Joseph.|$|E

The offensive was {{under the command of}} Lieutenant General Đỗ Cao Trí, the commander of III Corps, who had {{a reputation as one of}} the most aggressive <b>and</b> <b>competent</b> ARVN generals. During their first two days in Cambodia, ARVN units had several sharp encounters with PAVN forces.
