30|$|First, we {{attempted}} to investigate the effects of brand awareness and perceived quality on brand attitude <b>and</b> <b>purchase</b> intention. The results support brand awareness and perceived quality as positive influences on brand attitude (H 1) <b>and</b> <b>purchase</b> intention (H 2). In addition, the relationship between attitude <b>and</b> <b>purchase</b> intention was also supported (H 3). These {{results are consistent with}} the prior research, which found that brand awareness intensely affects the consumer decision-making process (Huang and Sarigöllü 2012; MacDonald and Sharp 2000) and that perceived quality significantly influences consumers’ attitudes <b>and</b> <b>purchase</b> intentions (Pappu et al. 2005). The result confirmed that brand attitude <b>and</b> <b>purchase</b> intention in the current study were systematically accumulated through consumers’ existing brand awareness and perceived quality; thus, the deterioration of attitude <b>and</b> <b>purchase</b> intention caused by negative information would be decisive and meaningful changes that would harm brand equity and corporate intangible asset which was accumulated over a long time.|$|R

30|$|Waiting in {{a service}} context {{is known to}} {{negatively}} affect consumer evaluation of services and service providers. However, this study investigates {{the positive effects of}} waiting—such as expected customer competition, excitement, <b>and</b> <b>purchase</b> intention—during the purchase of fashion merchandise. We classified waiting into four types based on whether waiting occurs, whether customers receiver a filler, or whether a filler is related to the context. A scenario-based online survey was conducted for empirical testing. After reading the scenario, 266 respondents replied to a questionnaire regarding expected competition, excitement, <b>and</b> <b>purchase</b> intention. The findings indicated that expected competition, excitement, <b>and</b> <b>purchase</b> intention differed significantly according to the wait type. Customers provided with a context-related filler reported the highest expected competition, excitement, <b>and</b> <b>purchase</b> intention, <b>and</b> excitement was found to mediate the relationship between expected competition <b>and</b> <b>purchase</b> intention. This paper ends by discussing its implications for managing waiting at a fashion store.|$|R
