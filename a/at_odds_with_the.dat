50|$|Katerina Ksenyeva {{was born}} in Saint Petersburg, Russia (formerly Leningrad, USSR). Her father is the widely {{acclaimed}} film director Yuri Mamin whose dissident views often put him <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> both <b>the</b> Soviet authorities and current Russian capitalist policies. Her mother is the actress Lyudmila Samokhvalova.|$|R
50|$|Despite the union, {{some former}} Progressive Conservative members still {{identify}} themselves as Red Tory, including high-profile political strategist turned Senator Hugh Segal, who in 2013 continued to describe himself as a Red Tory, which has put him <b>at</b> increasing <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> government on several occasions.|$|R
5|$|As Chief Minister, Modi favoured {{privatisation}} {{and small}} government, which was <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{philosophy of the}} RSS, usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. His policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in the state. He established financial and technology parks in Gujarat and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth 6.6trillion were signed.|$|E
5|$|Farm {{animals are}} {{widespread}} {{in books and}} songs for children; the reality of animal husbandry is often distorted, softened, or idealized, giving children an almost entirely fictitious account of farm life. The books often depict a rural idyll of happy animals free to roam in attractive countryside, which is completely <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> realities of the impersonal, mechanized activities involved in modern intensive farming.|$|E
5|$|In 1912 Shaw {{invested}} £1,000 for a one-fifth {{share in}} the Webbs' new publishing venture, a socialist weekly magazine called the New Statesman, which appeared in April 1913. He became a founding director, publicist, and in due course a contributor, mostly anonymously. He was soon <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> magazine's editor, Clifford Sharp, who by 1916 was rejecting his contributions—"the only paper {{in the world that}} refuses to print anything by me", according to Shaw.|$|E

50|$|Voight was {{reunited with}} {{director}} Boorman in 1998's The General. Set in Dublin, Ireland, the film tells the true-life {{story of the}} charismatic leader of a gang of thieves, Martin Cahill, <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> both <b>the</b> police and the Provisional IRA. Voight portrays Inspector Ned Kenny, determined to bring Cahill to justice.|$|R
50|$|<b>At</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> Frederic Quin, <b>the</b> {{earliest}} British {{physician who}} practised homoeopathy, Epps {{did not join}} the British Homoeopathic Society. He associated <b>with</b> Curie in <b>the</b> English Homoeopathic Association.|$|R
5|$|The {{results of}} archeological studies of 9th- and 10th-century gords in Greater Poland are <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{timing of this}} story. There was no Gniezno {{settlement}} in the 9th century; there was a pagan cult site there beginning only {{at the turn of}} the 10th century. The Gniezno gord was built around year 940, possibly because the location, of great spiritual importance to the tribal community, would rally the local population around its building and defense.|$|E
5|$|The {{synopsis}} is <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> reviewers of {{the film}} who state that the arrow which reveals the hidden cache is shot by the little boy and not the mother. The image still shows the woman with a large bow, but further details by the reviewers state that the boy used a toy bow and arrow to make the shot.|$|E
5|$|This was <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Eisenhower administration's Atoms for Peace program, and {{resulted}} in pressure on federal officials to develop a civilian nuclear power industry that could help justify the government's considerable expenditures on the nuclear weapons program. In 1953 the Atomic Energy Commission presented a set of draft amendments to the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy for consideration. After some debate, this resulted in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.|$|E

5|$|When the WFM {{withdrew from}} the IWW in 1907, Bill Haywood {{remained}} a member of both organizations. His murder trial had made Haywood a celebrity, {{and he was in}} demand as a speaker for the WFM. But his increasingly radical speeches became more <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> WFM, and in April 1908, the WFM announced that the union had ended Haywood's role as a union representative. Haywood left the WFM, and devoted all his time to organizing for the IWW.|$|E
5|$|Blyton's work became {{increasingly}} controversial among literary critics, {{teachers and parents}} from the 1950s onwards, because of the alleged unchallenging nature of her writing and the themes of her books, particularly the Noddy series. Some libraries and schools banned her works, which the BBC had refused to broadcast from the 1930s until the 1950s because they were perceived to lack literary merit. Her books have been criticised as being elitist, sexist, racist, xenophobic and <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> more liberal environment emerging in post-war Britain, but they have continued to be best-sellers since her death in 1968.|$|E
5|$|Egyptologists {{have noted}} that instead of hiding their non-royal origins, Neferhotep I, his {{predecessor}} Sobekhotep III, and his successor Sobekhotep IV, remarkably proclaimed them on their stelae and scarab seals. This is <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> traditional Egyptian system where {{the legitimacy of the}} new king rests mainly on his filiation. These proclamations of non-royal origins were possibly made to dissociate these kings from their immediate predecessors, in particular Seth Meribre whose monuments have been usurped and defaced. The reason for this remains unknown.|$|E
500|$|Domitian ( [...] ; 24 October 51– 18 September 96) was Roman emperor from 81 to 96. He was {{the younger}} brother of Titus and son of Vespasian, his two {{predecessors}} on the throne, and the last member of the Flavian dynasty.

5|$|Hand's civil {{instincts}} were <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> duty of a {{judge to}} stay aloof from politics. As a judge he respected even bad laws; {{as a member of}} society he felt free to question the decisions behind legislation. In his opinion, members of a democratic society should be involved in legislative decision-making. He therefore regarded toleration as a prerequisite of civil liberty. In practice, this even meant that those who wish to promote ideas repugnant to the majority should be free to do so, within broad limits.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of sound cinema, among the various {{distinguished}} composers ready to try their hand at film music, Prokofiev was not an obvious choice for the commission. Based in Paris for almost a decade, he had a reputation for experimentation and dissonance, characteristics <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> cultural norms of the Soviet Union. By early 1933, however, Prokofiev was anxious to return to his homeland, and saw the film commission as an opportunity to write music in a more popular and accessible style.|$|E
5|$|Olds was {{assigned}} to command the 71st Fighter Squadron, which was soon detached from the 1st FG to the Air Defense Command and based at the Greater Pittsburgh Airport in Pennsylvania. As a result, he missed service in the Korean War despite repeated applications for a combat assignment. Discouraged and <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Air Force, {{in which he was}} seen as an iconoclast, Olds reportedly {{was in the process of}} resigning when he was talked out of it by a mentor, Maj Gen Frederic H. Smith, Jr., who brought him to work at Eastern Air Defense Command headquarters at Stewart AFB.|$|E
50|$|Cupid was {{the enemy}} of chastity, and the poet Ovid opposes him to Diana, the virgin goddess of the hunt who {{likewise}} carries a bow but who hates Cupid's passion-provoking arrows. Cupid is also <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> Apollo, <b>the</b> archer-brother of Diana and patron of poetic inspiration whose love affairs almost always end disastrously. Ovid blames Cupid for causing him to write love poetry instead of the more respectable epic.|$|R
40|$|György Ligeti (1923 - 2006) had {{a special}} {{affinity}} for the poetry of his countryman Sándor Weöres (1913 - 1989). Early songs set Weöres’ iridescent symbolism within spiky arrangements whose imagery seems <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> both <b>the</b> whose imagery seems <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> both <b>the</b> “new nationalism” advocated by Bartók and the prevailing doctrines of Socialist Realism. Ligeti set Hungarian again only twice, returning to poems by Weöres in 1983 (the 16 -voice Hungarian Etudes) and 2000 (Síppal, doppal, nádihegedűvel for mezzo-soprano and four percussionists). In these settings both poetry and music embody the “cosmopolitan imagination,” a condition of self-problematization promoting new relations between self, other and world. I argue that the free-floating exoticism of these works neither mimics nor merges the vernacular music that inspires it, but produces an authentic moment of aesthetic discovery. Weöres’s fantastic poems meet a similar sonic world to produce a singular event, a comic turn that grounds the universal in the concrete, whether the context be melancholy princesses, singing wolves, or dreaming apples...|$|R
5000|$|Margolis {{identifies}} {{his politics}} as [...] "Eisenhower Republican". Though his domestic political persuasion is moderately conservative (he is a staunch anti-communist and {{a supporter of}} capitalism), Margolis' views on the Middle East are sharply <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> those of <b>the</b> neoconservatives.|$|R
5|$|Several {{groups of}} {{characters}} serve as Felix's antagonists in The Lost Age. He is <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{heroes of the}} original Golden Sun, led by the young Venus Adept warrior Isaac, who pursue him across the World, Weyard under the belief that Alchemy would potentially destroy Weyard if unleashed. One of Saturos' original companions, a powerful and enigmatic Mercury Adept named Alex, allies himself with a second pair of powerful and imposing Mars Adept warriors, Karst and Agatio. They {{keep the pressure on}} Felix to ensure he proceeds with his quest as he is supposed to.|$|E
5|$|Though they aren't very {{enthusiastic}} {{at the idea}} of acting in a film about the independence movement, Sue eventually manages to convince them. Laxman Pandey (Atul Kulkarni), a right-wing political party activist, joins the cast later, despite initially being unpopular due to his anti-Western ideology, due to which he is often <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> other four, and anti-Muslim beliefs and contempt for Aslam Khan. In the process of filming, the idealism of India's revolutionary heroes seeps into the protagonists. They gradually begin to realize that their own lives are quite similar to the characters they portray in Sue's film and that the state of affairs that once plagued the revolutionaries continues to torment their generation.|$|E
5|$|U.S. officials, {{convinced}} that the British Band was hostile, mobilized a frontier militia and opened fire on a delegation from the Native Americans on May 14, 1832. Black Hawk responded by successfully attacking the militia at the Battle of Stillman's Run. He led his band to a secure location {{in what is now}} southern Wisconsin and was pursued by U.S. forces. Meanwhile, other Native Americans conducted raids against forts and settlements largely unprotected with the absence of U.S. troops. Some Ho-Chunk and Potawatomi warriors with grievances against European-Americans took part in these raids, although most tribe members tried to avoid the conflict. The Menominee and Dakota tribes, already <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Sauks and Meskwakis, supported the U.S.|$|E
5000|$|In 2013, the Rabbinical Court of the Ashkenazi Community in the ultra-Orthodox {{settlement}} of Beitar Illit ruled against Zumba (a type of dance fitness) classes, {{although they were}} held with a female instructor and all-female participants.
