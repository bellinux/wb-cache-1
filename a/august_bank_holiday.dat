5|$|Kirchherr {{admits that}} she is not good at {{business}} as she is not organised enough, and has never really looked after the negatives of her photographs to prove ownership. Her business partner Ulf Krüger—a songwriter and record producer—successfully found many of Astrid's negatives and photographs and had them copyrighted, although he believes that Kirchherr has lost £500,000 over the years because of people using her photographs without permission. In July 2001 Kirchherr visited Liverpool to open an exhibition of her work at the Mathew Street art gallery, which is close to the former site of The Cavern Club. She appeared as a guest at the city's Beatles Week Festival during the <b>August</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>Holiday.</b> Kirchherr's work has been exhibited internationally in places, such as Hamburg, Bremen, London, Liverpool, New York City, Washington D.C., Tokyo, Vienna, and at the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|The {{museum was}} opened by The King at the Crystal Palace on 9 June 1920. During the opening ceremony, Sir Alfred Mond {{addressed}} the King {{on behalf of}} the committee, saying that 'it was hoped to make the museum so complete that every one {{who took part in the}} war, however obscurely, would find therein an example or illustration of the sacrifice he or she made' and that the museum 'was not a monument of military glory, but a record of toil and sacrifice'. Shortly afterwards the Imperial War Museum Act 1920 was passed and established a Board of Trustees to oversee the governance of the museum. To reflect the museum's Imperial remit the board included appointees of the governments of India, South Africa, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. While the Act was being debated, some Parliamentarians felt that the museum would perpetuate an undesirable war spirit and Commander Joseph Kenworthy MP said that he would 'refuse to vote a penny of public money to commemorate such suicidal madness of civilisation as that which was shown in the late War'. On the <b>August</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>Holiday</b> 1920, the first public holiday since the museum's opening, 94,179 visitors were received, and by November 1921, 2,290,719 had visited the museum.|$|E
5|$|From March 1958 Formby {{appeared}} in the musical comedy Beside the Seaside, a Holiday Romp in Hull, Blackpool, Birmingham and Brighton. By the time it reached Brighton the play was playing to increasingly small audiences, and the run was cut short as a result. The play {{may not have been}} to southern audiences' tastes—the plot centres on a northern family's holiday in Blackpool—and the Brighton audiences may have been too small, but those in the north, particularly Blackpool, thought highly of it and the show was a nightly sell-out. When the show closed Formby was disappointed, and vowed never to appear in another stage musical. The year 1958 was professionally quiet for him; in addition to Beside the Seaside, he also worked in one-off appearances in three television shows. He began 1959 by appearing in Val Parnell's Spectacular: The Atlantic Showboat in January, and in April hosted his own show, Steppin' Out With Formby. During the summer season he appeared at the Windmill Theatre, Great Yarmouth, although he missed two weeks of performances when he was involved in a car crash on the <b>August</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>Holiday.</b> When doctors examined him, they were concerned with his overall health, {{partly as a result of}} his forty cigarettes-a-day smoking habit. He also had high blood pressure, was overweight and had heart problems.|$|E

5|$|After {{a public}} meeting in Amlwch to gauge local support, Isle of Anglesey Railways Ltd (IoAR) was {{established}} in 1991 {{with the aim of}} restoring passenger services to the line. Special trains ran from Bangor to a temporary station at Amlwch on the Spring and <b>August</b> <b>bank</b> <b>holidays</b> of 1992, and the 125th anniversary of the line's opening (a total of eight return trips). Pathfinder Tours subsequently ran an excursion from York to Llandudno and Amlwch in October 1993. The project's viability was discussed with the Welsh Development Agency and Anglesey District Council, followed by negotiations in July 1993 with Railfreight Distribution to purchase the line. Octel offered a portion of its private railway for the building of a new station at Amlwch. IoAR initially hoped to start passenger services between Amlwch and Llangefni as early as 1994.|$|R

5000|$|After its {{purchase}} by Trafalgar House PLC, {{the building}} was demolished during the <b>August</b> 1980 <b>bank</b> <b>holiday</b> weekend, reportedly in anticipation of its becoming listed. The Twentieth Century Society call the structure their [...] "first serious case" [...] and say that its destruction ... focused public attention on the necessity for greater protection for 20th century buildings and led directly to the listing of 150 examples of inter-war architecture (including Battersea Power Station) by the government.|$|R
50|$|Charsfield {{is a small}} Suffolk {{village of}} 355 residents,(2011) 3 mi from Wickham Market, 7 mi from Woodbridge and 12 mi from Ipswich and is located near the villages of Debach and Dallinghoo. A Civil Parish in East Anglia, Charsfield was famously used {{as one of the}} key {{locations}} in the 1974 film Akenfield, based loosely upon the book Akenfield: Portrait of an English Village by the historian Ronald Blythe (1969). Charsfield hosted the first Greenbelt festival - an annual festival of arts, faith and justice - on a pig farm just outside the village over the <b>August</b> 1974 <b>bank</b> <b>holiday</b> weekend. Famous Charsfield residents include Charles Webb, a respected Victorian architect and Peggy Cole, a frequent speaker on BBC's Radio Suffolk.|$|R
40|$|The Caer Llan Trilogy {{comprised}} three annual performance intensive {{events of}} 4 - 5 days each over the <b>August</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>Holidays,</b> 2002 - 04 (with gestation periods between). These were: - Caer Llan 1 : The Caer Llan Sestina (2002); - Caer Llan 2 : Disrupting the Landscape (2003); - Caer Llan 3 : Performing Place (2004). The {{format of the}} intensives varied. The first and second ended with outcomes to an invited audience, for example; the third comprised peer-viewed group and individual practical ‘responses’ across the five days. Originally, the research project {{was intended to be}} for one year, the Caer Llan Sestina of 2002. It became apparent, however, even before the first intensive commenced, that a trilogy would offer greater research opportunities. The CLT was established to explore the performance of place. What might comprise a performance of place? Were there different impulses, processes or realisations in the performance of place to, say, site-specific performance, for example? This was part of a long term research interest into place and performance stemming from the late 1990 s. The project at Caer Llan provided an opportunity to explore certain facets of the performance of place in explicit detail. The key research questions of the Trilogy were, broadly: - To what extent can performance impact upon participants’ understanding of place? - Can performance have a function in articulating place? Rooted in current and recent theories of place, the CLT provides a case study of place-related performance praxis, therefore...|$|R
25|$|As {{a result}} of Suez affair, {{forecasts}} for 1957 season were gloomy, but the programme ran as planned, the two feature meeting of the year being run for the new Formula Two on Whit Sunday and <b>August</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>Holiday.</b> The year saw a continued diversification at BRSCC meetings with fewer 500cc events and more sport-racing machinery. The Kentish 100 was the biggest event yet run at the circuit for Formula Two with two 42-lap heats and attracted a truly International field. Formula Two featured at other meetings but at the <b>August</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>Holiday</b> meeting, Formula 3 proved {{that it was not}} yet dead as it was run as the feature event for the Daily Telegraph Trophy.|$|E

50|$|If Davidstow had {{one clear}} {{advantage}} over other circuits {{it was that}} there was a distinct absence of complaining populace. Two meetings were planned for 1953, on the Whitsun <b>Bank</b> <b>Holiday</b> Monday and on 1 <b>August.</b> The <b>Bank</b> <b>Holiday</b> dawned over Cornwall as a lovely summer's day and a crowd of 20,000 was hoped for, but this being Bodmin Moor it was blanketed in fog. After sheep were cleared from the bank straight, the weather had improved sufficiently to allow the drivers to have their statutory three laps of practice. So Davidstow’s first race commenced (as opposed to speed trails and relay races) over five laps for the first heat of the sports car race up to 1,500 cc. It was won by M.G. Llewellyn in an MG TD. After more fog related problems, Davidstow witnessed its first race for real racing cars - Formula Three over 20 laps. Two Kiefts won from two Coopers, Paulson and Westcott leading home Nurse and Piers. The winner’s average speed was 71.53 mph, with the fastest lap being shared between three drivers at 73.9 mph.|$|R
5000|$|Glavin's work {{of half a}} {{lifetime}} was the ambitious sequence of four-line poems, originally titled Living In Hiroshima. Anthony was haunted {{by the fact that}} his birthdate, 7 <b>August</b> 1945 (a <b>Bank</b> <b>Holiday</b> in Ireland), was just one day after Little Boy was dropped on Hiroshima; that his coming into the world coincided with an event that abruptly altered the world's [...] "historical velocity." [...] As the title of the first poem in the sequence (taken from a Time article in 1985) puts it: [...] "Everybody lives in Hiroshima." [...] When Anthony received his Arts Council bursary in 1990, his intention was to travel to Japan, to visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki and supplement his extensive research with actual experience.|$|R
5000|$|Contemporary {{newspaper}} reports {{at the beginning}} of September linked Tabram's murder to those of Emma Elizabeth Smith on 3 April and Mary Ann Nichols on 31 August, though before she died, Smith had told the police that a gang had attacked her. The later killings of Annie Chapman on 8 September, of both Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes on 30 September and of Mary Jane Kelly on 9 November were also linked at the time to Tabram's. The last five murders mentioned are now generally referred to as the [...] "canonical five" [...] victims of Jack the Ripper. All were knife murders of impoverished prostitutes in the Whitechapel district, generally perpetrated in darkness in the small hours of the morning, in a secluded site to which the public could gain access, and which occurred on or close to a weekend or holiday.
