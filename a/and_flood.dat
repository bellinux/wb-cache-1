5|$|Its winter range {{includes}} southern Canada {{and stretches}} south through the United States {{to parts of}} Mexico. In winter, {{in the northern part}} of its range, the finch may move nearer to feeders if they are available. In southern ranges, during winter, they remain in areas similar to the fields <b>and</b> <b>flood</b> plains where they live during the summer months.|$|E
5|$|The Ediacara-type {{assemblage}} {{is named}} after Australia's Ediacara Hills, and consists of fossils preserved in facies of coastal lagoons and rivers. They are typically found in red gypsiferous and calcareous paleosols formed on loess <b>and</b> <b>flood</b> deposits in an arid cool temperate paleoclimate. Most fossils are preserved as imprints in microbial earths, but a few are preserved within sandy units.|$|E

5|$|According {{to another}} legend, {{there was once}} a sea where the Dnieper River now flows. When Saint Andrew came to Kiev and erected a cross on the place where the Saint Andrew's Church now stands, the sea went away. The only part that {{remained}} of the sea is under the mountain on which Kiev sits today. When the church was built there in the 18th century, a spring opened under the altar. The church has no bells, because, according to the legend, when the first bell strikes, the water can revive again <b>and</b> <b>flood</b> the left bank of Kiev.|$|E
5|$|Alligator weed was {{introduced}} to the United States from South America. It takes root in shallow water, interfering with navigation, irrigation, <b>and</b> <b>flood</b> control. The alligator weed flea beetle and two other biological controls were released in Florida, greatly reducing the amount of land covered by the plant. Another aquatic weed, the giant salvinia (Salvinia molesta) is a serious pest, covering waterways, reducing water flow and harming native species. Control with the salvinia weevil (Cyrtobagous salviniae) and the salvinia stem-borer moth (Samea multiplicalis) is effective in warm climates, and in Zimbabwe, a 99% control of the weed was obtained over a two-year period.|$|E
5|$|Apollo 16 was {{the second}} of the Apollo type J missions, {{featuring}} the use of the Lunar Roving Vehicle, increased scientific capability, and lunar surface stays of three days. As Apollo 16 was the penultimate mission in the Apollo program and there was no new hardware or procedures to test on the lunar surface, the last two missions (the other being Apollo 17) presented opportunities for astronauts to clear up some uncertainties in understanding the Moon's properties. Although previous Apollo expeditions, including Apollo 14 and Apollo 15, obtained samples of pre-mare lunar material, before lava began to upwell from the Moon's interior <b>and</b> <b>flood</b> the low areas and basins, none had actually visited the lunar highlands.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Nora was {{the first}} Pacific {{hurricane}} to bring gale-force winds to the Continental United States since Kathleen in 1976. In Mexico, Nora produced high waves, flooding, and heavy damage. Many homes were destroyed. In the United States, rains were heavy, and damage amounted to several hundred million dollars. Several hundred people were rendered homeless, and there was wind <b>and</b> <b>flood</b> damage in Arizona. Nora killed two people in Mexico, and several indirect deaths were reported in California.|$|E
5|$|In {{the postwar}} period, Lawton {{underwent}} tremendous growth {{during the late}} 1940s and 1950s, leading city officials to seek additional water sources to supplement existing water from Lake Lawtonka. In the late 1950s, the city purchased large parcels of land along East Cache Creek in northern Comanche County {{for the construction of}} a man-made lake with a dam built in 1959 on the creek just north of U.S. 277 west of Elgin. Lake Ellsworth, named for a former Lawton mayor, soft-drink bottler C.R. Ellsworth, was dedicated in the early 1960s. It offered additional water resources, but also recreational opportunities <b>and</b> <b>flood</b> control along Cache Creek.|$|E

5|$|Like other otters, the North American {{river otter}} {{lives in a}} holt, or den, {{constructed}} in the burrows of other animals, or in natural hollows, such as under a log or in river banks. An entrance, which may be under water or above ground, leads to a nest chamber lined with leaves, grass, moss, bark, and hair. Den sites include burrows dug by woodchucks (Marmota monax), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), nutria (Myocastor coypus), or beaver and muskrat lodges. River otters also may use hollow trees or logs, undercut banks, rock formations, backwater sloughs, <b>and</b> <b>flood</b> debris. The use of den and resting sites is chiefly opportunistic, although locations that provide protection and seclusion are preferred.|$|E
5|$|Mexican army {{headquarters}} put {{in effect}} an emergency plan three {{days prior to}} the arrival of the hurricane. An estimated 15,000 people evacuated from threatened areas in the path of Madeline. According to one report, evacuations prior to Madeline were considered a success. Hurricane warnings <b>and</b> <b>flood</b> warnings were issued along the coastlines of Michoacán and Guerrero. In addition, tropical storm warnings were issued for nine states in Mexico. This warning area extended as far inland as the area west of the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Of {{most vital}} {{importance}} to marshes are invertebrate animals, {{the foundation of}} food webs. Amphibious invertebrates such as apple snails (Pomacea paludosa), crayfish, and grass shrimp consume plant material, hastening its decomposition and acting as a food source for fish and birds. Insect larvae use water for breeding, feeding upon smaller copepods and amphipods that live in microscopic algae and periphyton formations. Mosquitos, born in water, are in turn the favorite food of 112 species of dragonflies and 44 species of damselflies in Florida. These animals are water hardy and adaptable to dry conditions when water levels fluctuate from one season to the next or through drought <b>and</b> <b>flood</b> cycles.|$|E

5|$|Oroville Dam is an earthfill {{embankment}} dam on the Feather River {{east of the}} city of Oroville, California, in the Sierra Nevada foothills east of the Sacramento Valley. At 770 feet (235m) high, it is the tallest dam in the U.S. and serves mainly for water supply, hydroelectricity generation <b>and</b> <b>flood</b> control. The dam impounds Lake Oroville, the second largest man-made lake in the state of California, capable of storing more than 3.5 million acre-feet (4.4km3).|$|E
5|$|The 1903 Florida {{hurricane}} was an Atlantic hurricane {{that caused}} extensive wind <b>and</b> <b>flood</b> {{damage on the}} Florida peninsula and over the adjourning Southeastern United States in early to mid September 1903. The third tropical cyclone and third hurricane of the season, this storm was first observed near Mayaguana island in the Bahamas early on September9. Moving northwestward, it became a hurricane {{the next day and}} passed near Nassau. The cyclone then turned to the west-northwest on September 11 and passed just north of the Bimini Islands. As it crossed the Bahamas, the cyclone produced hurricane-force winds that caused damage to crops and buildings, but no deaths were reported over the island chain.|$|E
5|$|The CPS men served without {{wages and}} minimal {{support from the}} federal government.

CPS men served longer than regular draftees and were not released until well {{after the end of the}} war. Initially skeptical of the program, government agencies learned to appreciate the men's service and requested more workers from the program. CPS made significant contributions to forest fire prevention, erosion <b>and</b> <b>flood</b> control, medical science and reform of the mental health system.|$|E
