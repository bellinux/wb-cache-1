25|$|Administration of the Supreme Court {{is managed}} by its registry, which handles {{matters such as}} {{receiving}} and storing court documents filed in the court, and ensuring they are transmitted to judges for use during hearings. The Registry is headed by the Registrar who is assisted by the Deputy Registrar, Senior Assistant Registrars and Assistant Registrars. These officers are appointed by the President on the Chief Justice's recommendation, and {{are members of the}} Judicial Branch of the Singapore Legal Service. In addition to their administrative responsibilities, registrars deal with certain types of court proceedings in chambers, such as the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>damages,</b> hearings of bankruptcy petitions and applications, interlocutory matters and pre-trial conferences. Registrars are also appointed as district judges or magistrates, which enables them to conduct preliminary inquiries to determine whether there are enough grounds for trying accused persons for criminal offences in the High Court. The Registry is also staffed by commissioners for oaths, interpreters, clerks and process servers. Justices' law clerks, who work directly under the Chief Justice's charge, assist Judges and Judicial Commissioners with legal research, particularly for Court of Appeal matters.|$|E

The types of areas which have been studied are areas of national interest and Natura 2000 areas. The method has been developed with reference to a major review of e. g. Swedish, European and supranational handbook and educational literature, investigation material from infrastructure projects, and current guidelines and laws. The method is designed as a checklist which deals with a number of planning stages, i. e. a number of questions each of which must be answered before proceeding {{to the end of the}} checklist where an assessment - no damage, damage or pronounced damage - has to be made. At the same time, those completing the checklist must also answer a number of relevant questions in order to motivate their standpoint regarding the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage,</b> both to themselves and to others. The method has been tested on a newly produced EIA and has been judged by external reviewers to work well...|$|R

40|$|In an {{unpredictable}} world where human intervention or unexpected environmental conditions can prevail, damage can occur to manmade structures. Whilst structural design allows for redundancy, or a structural capability beyond the general working load of the structure, {{it is necessary}} to be able to analyse and understand the residual capability <b>of</b> a <b>damaged</b> structure {{to ensure the safety of}} personnel in the vicinity of the structure and assess the potential to facilitate repair. Idealised Structural Unit Method (ISUM) can allow rapid <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> large structural arrangements by simplification into smaller constituent parts, which are assessed against pre-calculated failure data for each part. The method has potential benefits for allowing rapid <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>damaged</b> steel-plated structure that would otherwise require the use of high fidelity modelling of the entire structures, such as through the use of finite element analysis. This paper presents a study on the use of ISUM to assess damaged steel-plated structures and its limitations through the collapse analysis of stiffened steel panels. A new ISUM is proposed for strength <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>damaged</b> structural arrangements. Analysis is undertaken to assess the effects of geometrical and material property variations that can occur in a structure as well as the effects <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> aperture size and shape on the collapse strength of stiffened steel panels. The study shows that while ISUM can be applied in the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>damaged</b> steel-plated structures, implementing the proposed new ISUM allows greater accuracy in the calculation of the collapse strength <b>of</b> <b>damaged</b> stiffened steel panels. The paper also concludes that the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> larger structural units for application in the ISUM assessment, will allow the effects <b>of</b> the <b>damage</b> on surrounding structure to be captured, which can influence the deflection shapes that will lead to collapse of the structure...|$|R
