Those who wish to leave for the Undying Lands often go by boats provided at the Grey Havens, where Círdan the Shipwright dwells with his folk.|$|E
5|$|Ford seriously {{considered}} leaving the Senate and {{running for governor}} again in 1983 and 1991, but decided against it both times. In the 1983 contest, he would have faced sitting lieutenant governor Martha Layne Collins in the primary. Collins was a factional ally of Ford's, which influenced his decision. In 1991, Ford cited his seniority in the Senate <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> become Democratic Senate whip as factors in his decision not to run for governor.|$|E

60|$|The {{intimacy}} thus commenced grew rapidly; {{though it}} encountered temporary interruptions. Earnshaw {{was not to}} be civilized with a wish, and my young lady was no philosopher, and no paragon of patience; but both their minds tending to the same point--one loving <b>and</b> <b>desiring</b> <b>to</b> esteem, <b>and</b> the other loving <b>and</b> <b>desiring</b> <b>to</b> be esteemed--they contrived in the end to reach it.|$|R
40|$|Two {{samples of}} middle-aged women were {{compared}} using a questionnaire adapted from Rossi (1980). One sample (N = 20) consisted {{of women who}} felt older than <b>and</b> <b>desired</b> <b>to</b> be younger than their own age. The second sample (N = 19) was comprised of women who felt <b>and</b> <b>desired</b> <b>to</b> be their own age. Statistically {{significant differences between the}} groups were that women who felt older reported more physical changes of aging, less satisfaction with their life context, and more worries than the women who felt their chronological age. Results {{of this study suggest that}} current life stress contributes to middle-aged women's perceptions of feeling older <b>and</b> <b>desiring</b> <b>to</b> be younger than their own age...|$|R
5|$|Kesler's {{success as}} a player has been {{attributed}} to his competitiveness <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> outwork opposing players. Kesler has recognized, however, that his competitive drive has often caused him to lose his composure. In the 2010 off-season, Canucks management encouraged him to play with more focus, maintaining his emotions and decreasing physical and verbal confrontation with opposing players. During the subsequent 2010–11 campaign, he gained media attention for changing his play accordingly while enjoying the best season of his career. Kesler has also credited the change with his role as a father, wanting to set a mature example for his children when they watch him play.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode is}} set on the fiftieth {{birthday}} of Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), {{and much of the}} plot revolves around his concerns with his age <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> reclaim the happiness of his childhood. At the same time, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is forced to deal with her ex-boyfriend Dennis Duffy (Winters) and his self-diagnosis as a sex addict as well as the fact that Dennis slept with her close friend Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski). A final plotline in the episode involves the desire of Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) to travel in space, and the efforts by Liz and Jack to deceive him into thinking he has done so.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} both sides claimed victory and modern views {{as to who}} won the battle remain contradictory. Because the war was almost over and the battle had no {{strategic}} impact on the ongoing Battle of Berlin, German historiography has focused more on its tactical aspects. The German operation successfully recaptured Bautzen and its surroundings, which were held {{until the end of}} the war. Polish historiography during the People's Republic of Poland portrayed the battle as difficult, but victorious. After the fall of communism, Polish historians became much more critical of Świerczewski's command, blaming the near destruction of the Polish force on his incompetence <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> capture Dresden. The battle's outcome is now generally seen in Poland as a very costly victory for the Soviets and their Polish allies.|$|E

5|$|In late 2014 {{and early}} 2015, Rivers briefly {{considered}} running {{to be the}} chair of Clark County, a new position created with the home rule charter that Rivers worked to pass. There is no official rule against serving both as the chair and a state senator, but there were concerns about Rivers' ability to balance the two offices. In December 2014, Rivers officially announced she would run for the office. On March 2, 2015, The Columbian reported Rivers would likely be withdrawing from the race later that week. That was confirmed when Rivers released a statement later that day that said Rivers {{would not be a}} candidate. Rivers cited the time commitment <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> stay in the State Senate as reasons for her withdrawal. She was considered the front runner for the office.|$|E
5|$|Nicky is {{persuaded to}} drop out of {{university}} and work for corrupt local politician Austin Donohue (Alun Armstrong), swayed by Donohue's apparent idealism <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> change Newcastle for the better. This is much to the annoyance of Nicky's trade unionist father Felix (Peter Vaughan), who does not want his son to waste opportunities that he never had when he was Nicky's age. Nicky's relationship with Mary ends when she becomes pregnant by Tosker and later marries him, which means she also drops out of university. On the run from a pregnant girlfriend himself and his abusive alcoholic father, Geordie leaves for London, where he falls in with seedy underworld baron Benny Barrett (Malcolm McDowell).|$|E
5|$|Despite Autumn Games' support <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> expand Skullgirls, their {{continued}} litigation prevented the publisher from providing any financial backing. Attempting {{to pick up}} where they left off, Lab Zero Games decided to ask its fanbase for help once more, following the success of the EVO 2013 charity drive. On February 25, 2013, Lab Zero Games set up an Indiegogo page for Skullgirls, in an effort to raise $150,000 {{for the development of the}} game's first DLC character, Squigly. Contributors received various rewards, including desktop wallpapers, a digital copy of the official soundtrack, Steam keys for the PC release, Steam keys for Half-Minute Hero, and the chance to add a background character to the game, among others. The campaign reached its initial goal in less than 24 hours, while the stretch goal of a second DLC character, Big Band, secured funding in just over 2 weeks. A third DLC character, determined by fan vote, was funded during the final two days, along with a playable robotic version of Ms. Fortune named Robo-Fortune. An additional stretch goal that would provide a free license for the game's engine, Z-Engine, to the developers of Them's Fightin' Herds (at the time called Fighting is Magic) was also funded. With minutes left before the end of the drive, the last stretch goal was met, securing funding for another fan-selected DLC character. The Indiegogo campaign raised nearly $830,000 of its original $150,000 goal. Several alternate character and announcer voice packs were also funded. All downloadable characters and voice packs were free to download on all platforms within the first three months of their release.|$|E

5|$|The {{quantity}} of studio work created {{a conflict between}} Costa's need <b>and</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> support his family, sometimes achieved through working day and night in studios, and his belief in developing his jazz talents, which would have required playing more in clubs {{and dealing with the}} people – agents, club owners, artists and repertoire men, and so on – whose goals seldom matched those of creative musicians. Notable examples of Costa's studio work from this period are being part of Gigi Gryce's final recordings as leader, appearances on Gunther Schuller's Third Stream album Jazz Abstractions, a series of small-group recordings with saxophonist Coleman Hawkins, and two tracks of Shelly Manne's 2-3-4, with Costa featuring on piano for one track and vibes on the other, both with just George Duvivier and Manne. Costa also contributed on vibes to Gryce's music for Fred Baker's short dance film On the Sound. A long association with pianist and arranger Ralph Sharon meant that Costa was the vibraphonist in the Sharon orchestra on June 9, 1962, when it played with Bennett at Carnegie Hall. Costa's final recording session was on July 12, 1962, as part of a group assembled by saxophonist Al Cohn mainly from the Benny Goodman band that had toured the Soviet Union earlier that year.|$|E
