5|$|The basidia (spore-bearing cells) measure 24–33 by 6.6–8.8μm, {{and may be}} {{attached}} to anywhere from one to four spores, although four-spored basidia are most common.

They are hyaline, fusoid-ampullaceous (with a shape ranging from a spindle to a swollen bottle), with dimensions of 20–45 by 5–8.2μm, and have a filamentous neck measuring 6–11 by 1.6–2.5μm. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are scattered, similar to the cheilocystidia in form and size, hyaline, and some have bifurcated or branched necks.|$|E

Astaroth stands 7 feet 3 inches tall, making him the largest character with a recorded height in the series.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, Bretagne was based in Toulon. At the time, Italy remained neutral, {{so there was no}} immediate threat to the Mediterranean Fleet. In December, Bretagne covered convoy traffic in the Atlantic. On 4 December, she and Provence, along with the cruisers Colbert, Dupleix, and Primauguet and several destroyers and submarines operated out of Dakar. <b>Around</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the month, the task force began to return to the Mediterranean. After returning to Toulon, Bretagne underwent an extensive overhaul, which lasted until 3 March 1940. On 11 March, she left France carrying 1,820 boxes of gold bars from the French treasury along with the cruiser Algérie, which carried another 1,179 boxes. They arrived in Halifax on 10 April. On the return voyage, they escorted two American merchant ships carrying 82 aircraft bought by France and arrived at Toulon on 10 April. On 27 April, Bretagne and her two sisters were transferred to Alexandria. Bretagne and Provence returned to Mers El Kébir on 18 May.|$|E

5|$|Shortly before {{mating season}} begins, females exhibit {{swelling}} of the sex skin, which reaches its peak <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of their 14.8 day estrous cycle. Male sexual physiology also undergoes its own change, with testicular volume increasing during mating season, peaking {{around the time of}} breeding. Aggression also increases during the mating season, both between members of the same sex and by females towards the male attempting to mate with her. Females have been observed grappling, cuffing, and biting the male during copulation. Either sex may approach the other when the female is in estrus. Initially they may roar-shriek with each other. When a male approaches a female he often lowers his head and squeals, inspecting the female's genitalia by licking or sniffing, scent-marking, and offering a submissive chattering vocalization. When a female approaches a male, she may posture herself for mounting. Mating pairs often copulate many times {{during the course of a}} mating bout.|$|E
5|$|Spruyt {{was the son}} of Jacobus Spuyt (1796–1839), a Dutch medical doctor, and Antje Landskroon. Both the Spruyt and Landskroon {{families}} {{stood in}} a tradition of medical practice, and three of the four brothers Spruyt had were doctors in the Netherlands. Spruyt himself trained as a lawyer at Leiden University, but probably did not finish his studies. He went on to work as a schoolteacher in the village of Oosterwolde in the north of the Netherlands. It was here that professor U.G. Lauts recruited him for South Africa in 1851. Lauts was {{one of a group of}} Dutchmen, interested in the development of good education in the new Boer settlements in South Africa. As such, Spruyt was one of the many Dutch immigrants that settled in the new Boer republics <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the nineteenth century.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the aqueduct has long been credited to the Roman emperor Augustus' son-in-law and aide, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, around the year 19 BC. At the time, he was serving as aedile, the senior magistrate responsible for managing the water supply of Rome and its colonies. Espérandieu, writing in 1926, linked the {{construction of}} the aqueduct with Agrippa's visit to Narbonensis in that year. Newer excavations suggest the construction may have taken place between 40 and 60 AD. Tunnels dating from the time of Augustus had to be bypassed by the builders of the Nîmes aqueduct, and coins discovered in the outflow in Nîmes are no older than the reign of the emperor Claudius (41–54 AD). On this basis, a team led by Guilhem Fabre has argued that the aqueduct must have been completed <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the 1st century AD. It is believed to have taken about fifteen years to build, employing between 800 and 1,000 workers.|$|E
5|$|The {{first half}} of the 12th century was a violent period in Gower, with {{extensive}} fighting occurring between the Anglo-Normans and the local Welsh. Loughor Castle was attacked and burnt down <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the century, probably {{as a part of a}} Welsh rebellion that devastated the area in 1151. Henry II and the Welsh prince Rhys ap Gruffydd later agreed peace terms, and the castle was rebuilt. The inside of the ringwork was partially filled by debris during the 1151 attack, and at some point in the next few decades the bank of the ringwork was also deliberately widened inwards in places, allowing buildings to be constructed on it. These changes started the process of filling in the middle of the ringwork which led to the castle today having a mound, or motte-like, appearance.|$|E
