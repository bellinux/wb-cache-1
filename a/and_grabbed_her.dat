25|$|Durousseau and {{his wife}} moved to Jacksonville, Florida, where they had two daughters. It was during that period that he {{committed}} most of the murders. He struggled to keep jobs and make ends meet, and the couple would often have fights {{over the issue of}} finances. In 1999, the police advised Durousseau's wife on how to file for a restraining order after he allegedly slapped her in the face <b>and</b> <b>grabbed</b> <b>her</b> by the neck. Later, she testified he got violently angry when she talked about getting a divorce. In September and October 2001, Durousseau spent 48 days in jail for domestic battery.|$|E
25|$|Priscilla Tirado was {{too weak}} to grab the line when the {{helicopter}} returned to her. A watching bystander, Congressional Budget Office assistant Lenny Skutnik, stripped off his coat and boots, and in short sleeves, dove into the icy water and swam out to successfully pull her to shore. The helicopter then proceeded to where Felch had fallen, and paramedic Gene Windsor stepped out onto the helicopter skid <b>and</b> <b>grabbed</b> <b>her</b> by the clothing to lift her onto the skid with him, bringing her to shore. When the helicopter crew returned for Williams, the wreckage he was strapped into had rolled slightly, submerging him—according to the coroner, Williams was the only passenger to die by drowning. His body and those of the other occupants were later recovered.|$|E

25|$|The storyline {{leading up}} to the match was that JBL caused Guerrero's mother {{to have a heart attack}} at a house show when he {{threatened}} her <b>and</b> <b>grabbed</b> <b>her</b> by the shoulder. At Judgment Day, JBL defeated Guerrero via disqualification in a match for the WWE title. A title cannot change hands by disqualification, so Guerrero retained the title. JBL controversially won his sole world championship, the WWE Championship from Guerrero in a Texas Bull Rope match at The Great American Bash. The initial decision of Guerrero's victory was reversed by then-General Manager Kurt Angle, awarding the match and the title to JBL; the replay showed that JBL touched the fourth corner before Guerrero. JBL won a rematch in a steel cage two weeks later, again with Angle's assistance.|$|E

[...] The bullet from the second shot ricocheted and hit John Ludwig, a 42-year-old taxi driver. Ludwig survived. U.S. District Judge Samuel Conti, still on the bench in 2010, spoke on the record, saying that Moore would have killed President Ford had {{she had her own}} gun, and it was only [...] "because her gun was faulty" [...] that the president's life was spared.|$|E

Protester Giles Ungphakorn noted, [...] "We believe we speak for a significant number of Thais who are too worried or too afraid to speak."

2500|$|Rude {{made his}} World Wrestling Federation (WWF) debut in July 1987 as the newest {{addition}} to the Bobby Heenan Family. His first feud in the WWF was with Heenan's former muscle bound charge [...] "Mr. Wonderful" [...] Paul Orndorff (who Heenan had dropped after Rude joined the Family), before starting {{one of his most}} famous feuds with Jake [...] "The Snake" [...] Roberts. Rude had a routine where, before the match, he would make a show of removing his robe while insulting the males in the crowd (usually calling them [...] "fat", [...] "out of shape" [...] or [...] "sweathogs") and, after his victories, he would kiss a woman that Heenan picked from the fans. One of Rude's trademarks was his specially airbrushed tights that he wore during matches. In the Roberts angle, Rude tried to get Roberts' real-life wife, Cheryl, to comply (though not knowing when Heenan chose her that she was in fact the wife of Jake [...] "The Snake"). After Mrs Roberts rejected him and revealed who she was there to see, Rude got angry (after she slapped him) <b>and</b> <b>grabbed</b> <b>her</b> wrist, berating her on the microphone when Roberts ran from the dressing room to make the save. To retaliate a few days later, Rude came to the ring with a likeness of Cheryl stenciled on the front of his tights. A furious Roberts charged the ring and stripped Rude, appearing to television viewers to leave him naked (as indicated by black-spot censoring Rude's genital area), although the live audience saw him actually stripped to a g-string.|$|E
