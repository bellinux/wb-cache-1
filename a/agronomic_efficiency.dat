40|$|Keywords: Sustainable farming systems, <b>Agronomic</b> <b>efficiency,</b> Economic efficiency, Environmental efficiency, Sustainability index, Interdisciplinary analysis. The {{objective}} of the research described in this thesis was to determine what role improved <b>agronomic</b> <b>efficiency</b> can play in the transition towards more sustainable production systems. <b>Agronomic</b> <b>efficiency</b> measures the technical performance. If it could be improved, environmental damage could be reduced while, at the same time, economic performance could be improved. The latter is an important condition for a successful transition to sustainable agriculture. Because economists and agronomists use different concepts and assumptions, they disagree about the efficiency that should be feasible in practice. Therefore, first a conceptual model integrating agronomic and economic concepts was developed. The model presents a division into production levels and accompanying production restricting factors. The hypothesis that improved <b>agronomic</b> <b>efficiency</b> also improves sustainability was tested empirically for sugar beet growing. A positive correlation was indeed found between <b>agronomic</b> <b>efficiency</b> and sustainability. Next, the effect of some production restricting factors on the <b>agronomic</b> <b>efficiency</b> was assessed, using a model that simulated crop growth and water and nitrate processes in the soil to assess the effect of annual variation in weather on the efficiency. It was found that efficiency decreased by 13 % due to variation in weather (including indirect weather effects). When the effect of differences in management was measured in an experiment using an interactive simulation model, socio-psychological factors were found to restrict the efficiency by 50 - 70 %. Finally, using these results, the conceptual model was completed quantitatively. The refined conceptual model suggests that {{the differences between the}} theoretically-assessed efficiency levels are considerably smaller than the differences between 'average' and 'best practice'. The general conclusion is that normative economic models seem to be a valuable tool for the development of sustainable production systems, as they incorporate not only knowledge derived from practice but also new technological findings. ...|$|E

The treatments in this experiment were included as follows: irrigation (normal irrigation and water deficit stress based on evaporation from class A pan evaporation); combined different seed inoculations with AM and Pseudomonas fluorescens and treatment of chemical phosphate fertilizer (non- consumption of phosphate fertilizer, consumption of 50 percent of triple superphosphate fertilizer needed, and consumption of rock phosphate, based on the quantity of consumed phosphorus of triple superphosphate source). The results showed that effects of irrigation, seed inoculation with AM and Pseudomonas fluorescens biological phosphate fertilizer and chemical phosphate fertilizer were significant on yield and yield components, dry matter yield, relative <b>agronomic</b> <b>efficiency</b> and root colonization.

We conducted a meta-analysis to provide a comprehensive and quantitative synthesis of conditions under which ORs, N fertilizers, and combined ORs with N fertilizers positively or negatively influence Zea mays (maize) yields, <b>agronomic</b> N use <b>efficiency</b> and soil organic C (SOC) in SSA. Four OR quality classes were assessed; classes I (high quality) and II (intermediate quality) had > 2. 5 % N while classes III (intermediate quality) and IV (low quality) had < 2. 5 % N and classes I and III had < 4 % polyphenol and < 15 % lignin. On the average, yield responses over the control were 60 %, 84 % and 114 % following the addition of ORs, N fertilizers and ORs + N fertilizers, respectively. There was a general increase in yield responses with increasing OR quality and OR-N quantity, both when ORs were added alone or with N fertilizers. Surprisingly, greater OR residual effects were observed with high quality ORs and declined with decreasing OR quality. The greater yield responses with ORs + N fertilizers than either resource alone were mostly due to extra N added and not improved N utilization efficiency because negative interactive effects were, most often, observed when combining ORs with N fertilizers. Additionally, their <b>agronomic</b> N use <b>efficiency</b> was not different from sole added ORs but lower than N fertilizers added alone. Nevertheless, positive interactive effects were observed in sandy soils with low quality ORs whereas <b>agronomic</b> use <b>efficiency</b> was greater when smaller quantities of N were added in all soils. Compared to sole added ORs, yield responses for the combined treatment increased with decreasing OR quality and greater yield increases were observed in sandy (68 %) than clayey soils (25 %). While ORs and ORs + N fertilizer additions increased SOC by at least 12 % compared to the control, N fertilizer additions were not different from control suggesting that ORs are needed to increase SOC. Thus, the addition of ORs will likely improve nutrient storage while crop yields are increased and more so for high quality ORs.

One of the problematic areas is {{the design of the}} air-delivery system, particularly if the pneumatic conveying system is wrongly dimensioned. The flow of seeding material during conveying must be high and regular enough for a high-speed seeding. There are three parameters that ensure the conveying of seeding material in a pipe: air velocity, flow concentration and pipe diameter. It is demonstrated that the outlets of the divider heads are the most critical part of the conveying system. Outlet pipes relatively small diameters and must allow for the highest seeding rates without clogging. It was hypothesised that the air velocity in outlet pipe may be used as an input data for designed a completed conveying system.

40|$|Traditional farming {{systems in}} Sub-Saharan Africa depend {{primarily}} on mining soil nutrients. The African green revolution aims to intensify agriculture through {{the dissemination of}} integrated soil fertility management (ISFM). This paper develops a robust and operational definition of ISFM based on detailed knowledge of African farming systems and their inherent variability and of the optimal use of nutrients. The authors define ISFM {{as a set of}} soil fertility management practices that necessarily include the use of fertilizer, organic inputs and improved germ plasm, combined with the knowledge on how to adapt these practices to local conditions, aimed at maximizing <b>agronomic</b> use <b>efficiency</b> of the applied nutrients and improving crop productivity. All inputs need to be managed in accordance with sound agronomic principles. The integration of ISFM practices into farming systems is illustrated with the dual-purpose grain legume-maize rotations in the savannas and fertilizer micro-dosing in the Sahel. Finally, the dissemination of ISFM practices is discussed. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Field {{studies were}} made on wheat and maize crops grown on loam soil to {{determine}} the effect of fertigated phosphorus (P) on crop yield and P use efficiency. In case of wheat, rate of P application was 33 and 44 kg P ha- 1 (not P 2 O 5) from single supperphosphate (SSP) and diammonium phosphate (DAP), while to maize it was 22 and 33 kg P ha- 1 from SSP only. The results showed that fertigated SSP enhanced the grain yield of wheat significantly over broadcast, while fertigated DAP did not affect it significantly. Application of lower dose (33 kg P ha- 1) from DAP by fertigation resulted in almost equivalent wheat yield with higher dose (44 kg P ha- 1) applied by broadcast method. Phosphorus uptake, P use and <b>agronomic</b> <b>efficiency</b> were higher in fertigation for both the P fertilizers than broadcast method. In case of the maize experiment, application of SSP by fertigation produced significantly higher grain yield as compared to the yield obtained from same dose applied by broadcast method. The lower dose (22 kg P ha- 1) applied through fertigation resulted in significantly higher grain yield than the full dose (44 kg P ha- 1) applied by broadcast. The P use efficiency and <b>agronomic</b> <b>efficiency</b> were higher in fertigation than broadcast method. In both studies, fertigated P enhanced the grain yield of the tested crops and improved the P use and <b>agronomic</b> <b>efficiency,</b> indicating the superiority of fertigation technique...|$|E
40|$|Efficient crop {{husbandry}} {{is crucial}} {{in order to prevent}} unnecessary emissions of environmentally damaging inputs and to maintain economic soundness, but it raises the question of which productivity and efficiency levels should be realised. Agronomists and economists are still debating this issue, as they base their insights on different production functions: economists assume decreasing returns of input use, whereas the response curve used by agronomists is often described as linear with a plateau (LRP). The first objective {{of this paper is to}} reconcile these points of view by showing that due to annual variation in weather individual LRP curves turn into a concave function with decreasing returns when aggregated. The second objective is to present empirical evidence on the impact of weather variation on optimal input levels for the case of nitrogen in sugar beet in The Netherlands. Two methods were used: bio-physical simulation and estimation with a regression model using panel data. Optimal crop growth and nitrogen input were simulated with the Water and Agro-chemicals in the soil and Vadose Environment (WAVE) model, using weather data for 43 years. Parameters were assessed with and without additional weather effects. An agronomic crop growth simulation model such as WAVE might underestimate the effect of variation in weather on the <b>agronomic</b> <b>efficiency</b> of nitrogen, because pests, weeds and diseases as well as the effectiveness of biocides, the sowing date and possible harvesting problems are strongly influenced by the weather. To test for this effect, weather indexes that include these indirect weather effects on the occurrence of pests and diseases were derived from panel data by means of a regression model. These weather indexes were used to re-assess the impact of weather variability on the <b>agronomic</b> <b>efficiency</b> of nitrogen in sugar beet cropping. The results of the bio-physical simulation showed that due to annual variation in weather the <b>agronomic</b> <b>efficiency</b> of nitrogen use was reduced by 10 % at the current ratio of prices of nitrogen and sugar beet. The variation in weather, including indirect effects, caused the <b>agronomic</b> <b>efficiency</b> to decrease by 13 %. This relatively small decrease suggests that at least some of the indirect weather effects might have an opposite effect on the <b>agronomic</b> <b>efficiency</b> of nitrogen use compared with the direct weather effects. This hypothesis seems to be supported by the absence of a significant correlation between the two weather indexes and by the lower estimated variance of the weather indexes based on panel data.

40|$|The {{potential}} for elevated nitrous oxide (N 2 O) losses {{is high in}} subtropical cereal cropping systems in north-east Australia, where the fertiliser nitrogen (N) input is one single application at or before planting. The use of urea coated with the nitrification inhibitor 3, 4 -dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) {{has been reported to}} substantially decrease N 2 O emissions and increase crop yields in humid, high-intensity rainfall environments. However, it is still uncertain whether this product is similarly effective in contrasting soil types in the cropping region of north-east Australia. In this study the grain yield response of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) to rates of fertiliser N applied as urea or urea coated with DMPP were compared in crops grown on a Vertisol and an Oxisol in southern Queensland. Seasonal N 2 O emissions were monitored on selected treatments {{for the duration of the}} cropping season and the early stages of a subsequent fallow period using a fully automated high-frequency greenhouse gas measuring system. On each soil the tested treatments included an unfertilised control (0  kg N ha – 1) and two fertilised treatments chosen on the basis of delivering at least 90 % of seasonal potential grain yield (160 and 120  kg N ha – 1 on the Vertisol and Oxisol respectively) or at a common (suboptimal) rate at each site (80  kg N ha – 1). During this study DMPP had a similar impact at both sites, clearly inhibiting nitrification for up to 8 weeks after fertiliser application. Despite the relatively dry seasonal conditions during most of the monitoring period, DMPP was effective in abating N 2 O emissions on both soils and on average reduced seasonal N 2 O emissions by 60 % compared with conventional urea at fertiliser N rates equivalent to those producing 90 % of site maximum grain yield. The significant abatement of N 2 O emissions observed with DMPP, however, did not translate into significant yield gains or improvements in <b>agronomic</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of fertiliser N use. These results may be due to the relatively dry growing season conditions before the bulk of crop N acquisition, which limited the exposure of fertiliser N to large losses due to leaching and denitrification. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} genetic diversity of grain yield, nitrogen uptake efficiency and selecting superior varieties, a factorial {{experiment with the}} based on Complete Blocks design with four replications {{was carried out in}} Saatlo agricultural research station, six corn genotypes (single cross 301, 370, 540, 700, 701 and Back cross) and three amounts of nitrogen fertilizer (urea) (27 as a control, 110 and 193 kg/hectare) established as second factors. Results of analysis of variance showed that there was high diversity in most traits with reducing of nitrogen levels. Between different levels of nitrogen fertilizer and genotype for traits such as ear diameter, row number per ear, grain per row, flag leaf area, stem diameter, plant height, grain yield, total dry matter and harvest index were significant difference (p 0. 01). Grain yield of Single cross 700 and 701 was more than other genotypes. Maximum and Minimum <b>agronomic</b> nitrogen use <b>efficiency</b> were seen in 110 kg nitrogen per hectare for single cross 540 and 193 kg nitrogen per hectare for single cross 701, respectively. The highest and lowest apparent nitrogen use recovery was obtained in 110 kg nitrogen per hectare for single cross 370 and 110 kg nitrogen per hectare for single cross 540, respectively.
