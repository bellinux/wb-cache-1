5|$|A {{particular}} viewpoint {{is called}} a naya or a partial viewpoint. According to Vijay Jain, Nayavada does not deny the attributes, qualities, modes and other aspects; but qualifies them to be from a particular perspective. A naya reveals {{only a part of}} the totality, and should not be mistaken for the whole. A synthesis of different viewpoints is said to be <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> doctrine of conditional predications (syādvāda).|$|E

50|$|In Australia, {{the twelfth}} grade is {{referred}} to as Year 12. In New South Wales, students are usually 16 or 17 years old when they enter Year 12 and 17-18 years during graduation (end of year). All students in Year 12 work towards getting an ATAR (Australian Tertiary Admission Rank) or OP (Overall Position, which applies only to students in the state of Queensland), which will allow them access to courses at university. In South Australia, this is <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> completing <b>the</b> SACE; in Victoria, this is <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> completing <b>the</b> VCE; in the Australian Capital Territory, this is <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> completing <b>the</b> AST and in New South Wales this is <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> completing <b>the</b> HSC.|$|R

50|$|To {{allow for}} the {{systematic}} integration of the pragmatic and dialectical dimensions {{in the study of}} argumentation, the pragma-dialectical theory uses four meta-theoretical principles as its point of departure: functionalization, socialization, externalization and dialectification. Functionalization is <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> treating discourse as a purposive act. Socialization is <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> extending <b>the</b> speech act perspective to the level of interaction. Externalization is <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> capturing <b>the</b> propositional and interactional commitments created <b>by</b> <b>the</b> speech acts performed. And dialectification is <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> regimenting <b>the</b> exchange of speech acts to an ideal model of a critical discussion. (see Van Eemeren & Grootendorst, 2004, pp.52-53).|$|R

5|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{differences}} between the digestive systems of sharks and mammals is that sharks have much shorter intestines. This short length is <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> spiral valve with multiple turns within a single short section instead of a long tube-like intestine. The valve provides a long surface area, requiring food to circulate inside the short gut until fully digested, when remaining waste products pass into the cloaca.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} of the metals itself is difficult due to their reactivity. The formation of oxides, nitrides and carbides must be avoided to yield workable metals; this is normally <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Kroll process. The oxides (MO2) are reacted with coal and chlorine to form the chlorides (MCl4). The chlorides of the metals are then reacted with magnesium, yielding magnesium chloride and the metals.|$|E

50|$|The {{object of}} the game is to be the first player to achieve 100% success, this is <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> {{reaching}} <b>the</b> top of four goals.

Happiness is <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> <b>achieving</b> other goals, acquiring goods and taking time off work.

5|$|Another problem {{encountered}} when {{applying the}} rational nexus test {{is that of}} over- and under-inclusiveness. Under-inclusiveness occurs when the legislative classification fails to embrace all persons within the ambit of the objective sought to be <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> law. On the other hand, over-inclusiveness occurs when the classification not only embraces persons within the ambit of the legislative objective, but also persons outside it. Both over- and under-inclusiveness are currently tolerated in Singapore under the rational nexus test, as a classification can still bear a rational relation to the legislative objective notwithstanding that it embraces more or less persons than its object requires.|$|E

5|$|Another {{result of}} the coup was that the work {{that had been done}} by British {{intelligence}} with the anti-Axis government of Cvetković and Maček was lost. By supporting the coup plotters, the SOE undermined the balance in Yugoslav politics that had been <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Cvetković–Maček Agreement. Serb nationalists supported and welcomed the coup because it ended Croatian autonomy under the Agreement and freed them to pursue a Greater Serbia agenda. The coup and its immediate aftermath also contributed to the paralysis within the Yugoslav government-in-exile {{during the rest of the}} war, due to ongoing disputes regarding the legitimacy of the Cvetković–Maček Agreement.|$|E
