Some of these sandstones contain fulgurites - pitted marks {{that may have been}} created by Permian lightning strikes. Large <b>aeolian</b> <b>sand</b> dunes are preserved in Permian sandstones near Brodick, showing the presence of an ancient desert. Within the central complex are subsided blocks of Triassic sandstone and marl, Jurassic shale, and even a rare example of Cretaceous chalk.

40|$|Two large sandy seas in {{northern}} China, the Taklamakan and Badanjilin deserts, were investigated for geochemical variations of soluble salts in <b>aeolian</b> <b>sands.</b> The {{aim was to}} explore factors influencing the composition and distribution of soluble salts in <b>aeolian</b> <b>sands</b> and their environmental implications. The total concentrations of soluble salt in the <b>aeolian</b> <b>sands</b> range between 0. 14 and 1. 32 aEuro degrees, with pH ranging between 8. 4 and 9. 6, indicating a primary degree of salt accumulation and alkaline soil conditions in these regions. Sodium chloride and bicarbonate are the major salts. High inter-regional homogenization and small local differences in the chemical compositions and distributional patterns of salt occur in the two deserts. The spatial variations in salt content correlate with regional climatic parameters, such as precipitation and temperature. This suggests that the regional air temperature and moisture conditions of climate have a significant influence on the soluble salts in <b>aeolian</b> <b>sands.</b> The domination of sedimentation of soluble salts in <b>aeolian</b> <b>sands</b> deposited via atmospheric processes, which is heavily associated with dry deposition, is discussed. Case studies from the two deserts suggest that variations in salt content in sedimentary sequences, interlaid by aeolian and lacustrine sediments, should be interpreted with care if {{the aim is to}} reveal palaeo-environmental changes. To a certain extent, the two deserts, as inferred from the carbon-bearing salts and the alkalinity of the sandy soils, appear to have potential to provide a significant contribution to the global carbon cycle...|$|R

40|$|Mediterranean {{temporary}} ponds on Doñana’s <b>aeolian</b> <b>sands</b> form {{an extensive}} system of small dynamic water bodies, dependent on precipitation and groundwater, of considerable importance for biodiversity conservation. Different {{areas of the}} <b>aeolian</b> <b>sands</b> have received different levels of environmental protection since 1969, and this has influenced the degree of conservation and the flooding dynamic of these temporary surface waters. We use the Landsat series of satellite images from 1985 to 2014 to study the temporal dynamic of small temporary water bodies on the <b>aeolian</b> <b>sands</b> {{in relation to the}} protection level and to distance to water abstraction pressures from agriculture and residential areas. The results show that even with small and ephemeral water bodies optical remote sensing time-series are an effective way to study their flooding temporal dynamics. The protected areas of the <b>aeolian</b> <b>sands</b> hold a better preserved system of temporary ponds, with a flooding dynamic that fluctuates with precipitation. The unprotected area shows an increase in mean hydroperiod duration, and surface flooded, and a decline in hydroperiod variability. This seems to be due to the creation of irrigation ponds and the artificialization of the flooding regime of the natural temporary ponds, that either receive excess irrigation water or dry-up due to the lowering of the groundwater table level. Although a decline in hydroperiod duration of temporary ponds is seen as negative to the system, an increase in hydroperiod of surface waters due to artificialization, or a decline in variability cannot be considered as positive compensatory effects.

50|$|When the {{excavation}} started at Blombos Cave in 1992 the cave entrance was partially sealed by dune sand, and about 20 cm of sterile Aeolian deposit covered the interior Later Stone Age deposit. Underneath the <b>aeolian</b> <b>sand</b> surface, seven main phases of occupation {{have been identified}} in the 2.5-3 meter deep Blombos Cave stratigraphic sequence; three in the Later Stone Age (L1-L3) and four in the Middle Stone Age (M1, Upper M2, Lower M2 and M3). These phases are further divided into finer lenses and sub-lenses, most of them less than 10 cm thick. The Later Stone Age and Middle Stone Age levels are separated by a 5-50 cm thick, sterile unit named ‘Hiatus’ or ‘DUN’.

40|$|Luminescence dating of <b>aeolian</b> <b>sands</b> from {{archaeological sites}} has {{potential}} {{to contribute to}} regional chronologies for sediment deposition {{and to provide a}} greater understanding of climatic influences on early communities. The Northern and Western Isles of Scotland provide important opportunities for sampling archaeologically intercalated sands for these purposes, and to provide constrained samples for method validation. A wide range of modern beaches have been sampled in the Western and Orkney Isles of Scotland to examine regional variations in luminescence sensitivity, residuals and ease of bleaching. These modern sands have negligible residuals for infra-red stimulated luminescence (IRSL), small optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) residuals and significant thermoluminescence residuals. The relationship between these signals and laboratory bleaching results may indicate the initial depositional environment, and hence lead to a means of identifying well-bleached dating samples. Both sensitivities and residuals show regional differences, reflecting local geology.

40|$|The Milanggouwan stratigraphical {{section in}} the Salawusu River Valley takes down 27 {{alternately}} evolutionary sediment sequences of the aeolian dune layers with the fluvio-lacustrine facies and palaeosols since 150 ka BP. Based on grain-size analyses of the 86 samples from the section, some views have been put forward: (1) Grain-size accumulative centigrade contents of the <b>aeolian</b> <b>sands</b> in the past 150 ka in Milanggouwan section are mainly characterized by the <b>aeolian</b> palaeo-mobile dune <b>sands,</b> {{and those of the}} fluvial facies dominated by very fine sands also contain some quantities of silt and clay. (2) The grain-size general distributional characteristics - Mz (particle diameter) and σ (standard deviation) clearly show that the fluvio-lacustrine facies and palaeosols usually become finer in particles and worse in sorting than the <b>aeolian</b> <b>sands.</b> As regards Sk (bias angle) and Kg (kurtosis) values, the former two increase obviously compared with the latter, displaying positive bias and the latter often proximately symmetrical distributed, only few in negative bias. (3) At vertical direction of the section, the grain-size distributional coarse and fine rhythms vary very pronouncedly with the alternation of sedimentary facies. Mz, σ, Sk, Kg and SC/D (ratio of the sum of silt and clay to sand) of fluvio-lacustrine, palaeosols and <b>aeolian</b> <b>sands</b> separately constitute a commulative between peak and valley values. (4) The values of grain-size parameters lie on their eigenvalues. Taking the eigenvalue Φ 50 as a boundary, the Φ 75, Φ 84 and Φ 95 above the eigenvalue have wide flounce range and high sensitivity responding to the sedimentary facies, which may be called 'active eigenvalues'. In contrast with them, those below the above-cited eigenvalue, i. e., Φ 5, Φ 16 and Φ 25, which have relatively narrow flounce range and low sensitivity, are called 'inert eigenvalues'. 萨拉乌苏河流域米浪沟湾地层剖面 150 ka BP 以来古流动砂丘砂与河湖相和古土壤在粒度上具有多次显著的粗细韵律交替变化, 粒度参数- M z、R、Sk、Kg 和SC/ D 亦随之响应为多波动峰谷交替的态势。同时, 粒度特征值- 5 5 、 5 16 、 5 25 、 5 50 、 5 75 、 5 84 、 5 95 相应地表现为非常有节奏地跳动。据此, 将米浪沟湾剖面划分为 27 个粒度粗细沉积旋回, 并认为其是 150 ka BP 以来在东亚冬夏古代季风交替影响下沙漠演变的一个颇为完整的气候- 地质过程记录。published_or_final_versio...|$|R
