40|$|The {{possible}} {{repeal of}} the Loss Attributing Qualifying Company (LAQC) regime in New Zealand has been raised again. This most recent announcement was canvassed in the discussion document concerning {{the introduction of a}} new limited partnership with tax transparency to facilitate venture capital investment. While the {{repeal of the}} LAQC regime has not eventuated, this article will argue that the rules for LAQC members utilising <b>allocated</b> <b>losses</b> are inadequate. This means that the LAQCs could compromise the integrity of the New Zealand tax base. Indeed, it will be argued that the loss restriction rules for the new limited partnerships are also inadequate. For both types of tax transparent companies, this article argues for the introduction of a broad loss restriction rule limiting the utilisation of <b>allocated</b> <b>losses</b> to a member's financial exposure amount. Also, important differences in the governance regimes between the two transparent companies are identified to support the continued availability of LAQCs. Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Power {{losses in}} {{transmission}} systems {{are most of}} the time seen as a small amount (2 - 5 %) from the total power carried over the network. However, transmission loss allocation may {{play a crucial role in}} the congestion management of balancing markets. Several loss allocation and loss cost allocation methods have been proposed and implemented in different markets. Most of these methods are intended to be used post-market. This study presents a novel near-real-time loss allocation method suitable to be applied in real-time markets as envisioned in the smart grid context. The proposed method allocates the total system losses fairly to all the demand and generator buses, by taking into account the dynamical changes of the power network states, which are provided by an accurate state estimation. The power flows required to determine the <b>allocated</b> <b>losses</b> are executed after an economic dispatch procedure that ignores losses, making the choice of the slack bus an independent factor. The proposed method can be used as an accurate real-time pricing for network usage while the resolving of transmission congestion can be more reliable...|$|E
40|$|Click on the DOI link {{to access}} the article (may not be free). In a {{deregulated}} power distribution system with distributed generation, end users should be allocated the appropriate cost of energy transactions for fair and effective operation. One of the common practices is to allocate the cost of power losses to distributed generators (DGs) and consumers based on their effective share. According to the network configuration, DGs and consumers could have positive or negative impacts on a system's overall loss. This paper addresses the effect of power distribution system reconfiguration on each user's share of loss. The overall system loss and maximum allocated loss are considered in the two competing objectives to be minimized. The branch current decomposition method {{is used to calculate}} the <b>allocated</b> <b>losses</b> to each bus. The group search optimizer (GSO), a swarm intelligence optimization method, is used to find the best solution. Using weighted factors, the priorities of decision-makers are applied to the optimization problem. A 33 -bus distribution system is used for which the best possible configuration is found...|$|E

40|$|Two major {{contributions}} {{are discussed in}} this part of a two-part set. first, it presents a new concept of market reactive power requirement (qreq) for every participant in both bilateral and pool markets. this qreq is defined as the reactive power loss allocation to each bilateral transaction using current adjustment factor (CAF) method that has been proposed in part 1. when a transaction is allowed to provide reactive power more than its qreq, it contributes to system reactive power needs and it is considered a reactive power provider. on the other hand, if it cannot produce its qreq, it relies on other reactive power sources to ship its contracted power and it is considered a reactive power consumer even though it may generate some reactive power. the concept then is extended to participants in a pool market. secondly, this paper proposes a new general concept of differentiated reactive power requirements for every participant in electricity markets. it assumes that qreq of a participant depends on its <b>allocated</b> <b>losses</b> using any appropriate loss allocation method. the proposals help system operators and market participants to trade reactive power as well as real power effectively and fairly. the simulation results show validity and consistency of the proposals...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} argued that the Australian {{government}} prefers an entity tax approach for business forms providing member(s) with limited liability and separate entity status. This contrasts a number of foreign jurisdictions that have provided tax transparency to such business forms ('tax transparent companies'), with income and/or losses directly allocated to members for tax purposes. Examples of foreign tax transparent companies include S Corporations and Limited Liability Companies in the United States, Limited Liability Partnerships in the United Kingdom; and Loss Attributing Qualifying Companies and new limited partnerships in New Zealand. A reason for the Australian government's preference is that unfettered access to tax losses by limited members could distort investments. Nevertheless, recently the Australian government provided restricted tax transparency for Incorporated Limited Partnerships used for venture capital investments ('venture capital ILPs') and controlled foreign hybrid companies ('CFC hybrids'). To address distortion concerns there are restrictions applying to <b>allocated</b> <b>losses</b> through these Australian transparent companies. However, are these restrictions adequate? This article considers whether the loss restriction rules applying to venture capital ILPs and CFC hybrids are adequate by comparing them to rules utilised in foreign jurisdictions with a history of transparent companies.

In addition to circumventing the problems of non-unique loss allocations, a formalised process of loop identification, using graph theory concepts, is introduced. The proposed method is applied to both the IEEE 14 -bus system and a modified CIGRE Nordic 32 -bus system.

40|$|Arguably {{the most}} {{important}} and problematic area within the entire field of negotiable instruments law is the law relating to forgery, especially the allocation of losses that result from forgery. Forgery is central to negotiable instrument law because a signature typically authenticates the orders and promises to pay on which the entire system is based. Unfortunately, forgery continues to cause substantial losses to American banks and the national economy. 2 ̆ 2 Despite the significance of this problem, many of the legal doctrines governing forgery loss allocation remain quite problematic, even after nearly three centuries of development. 2 ̆ 2 To combat the problem of negotiable instrument fraud, this Article argues that the time-honored doctrine of finality, as embodied in the case of Price v. Neal and § 3 - 418 (c) of the Revised Uniform Commercial Code (RUCC) should be transformed from a rigid, per se dictate into a default rule. This transformation would constitute a significant change in Anglo-American commercial paper law. The goal of this transformation is to allow presenters of negotiable drafts and payor banks to better <b>allocate</b> the <b>losses</b> of forgery to the party who is most willing to bear that burden. This ability to <b>allocate</b> <b>losses,</b> in turn, is designed to reduce the costs of forgery and improve the efficiency of the American commercial paper system...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of deregulation and subsequent open access policy in electricity sector has brought competition in energy market. Allocation of transmission loss {{has become a}} contentious issue among the electricity producers and consumers. A closed form solution for transmission loss allocation does not exist {{due to the fact}} that transmission loss is a highly non-linear function of system states and it is a non-separable quantity. In absence of a closed form solution different utilities use different methods for transmission loss allocation. Most of these techniques involve complex mathematical operations and time consuming computations. A new transmission loss allocation tool based on artificial neural network has been developed and presented in this thesis. The proposed artificial neural network computes loss allocation much faster than other methods. A relatively short execution time of the proposed method makes it a suitable candidate for being a part of a real time decision making process. Most independent system variables can be used as inputs to this neural network which in turn makes the loss allocation procedure responsive to practical situations. Moreover, transmission line status (available or failed) was included in neural network inputs to make the proposed network capable of <b>allocating</b> <b>loss</b> even during the failure of a transmission line. The proposed neural networks were utilized to <b>allocate</b> <b>losses</b> in two types of energy transactions: bilateral contracts and power pool operation. Two loss allocation methods were utilized to develop training and testing patterns; the Incremental Load Flow Approach was utilized for loss allocation in the context of bilateral transaction and the Z-bus allocation was utilized in the context of pool operation. The IEEE 24 -bus reliability network was utilized to conduct studies and illustrate numerical examples for bilateral transactions and the IEEE 14 -bus network was utilized for pool operation. Techniques were developed to expedite the training of the neural networks and to improve the accuracy of results...|$|R
40|$|We propose {{employing}} nodal factor pricing, {{a method}} as-sociated with <b>allocating</b> <b>losses</b> at EHV transmission lev-els, for {{the allocation of}} loss costs at the distribution level. This method differs from traditional methods of averag-ing losses across customers regardless of location, time of use, or the marginal contribution of net power injec-tion/withdrawal positions to losses. With respect to dis-tributed generation (DG) resources, nodal prices provide more efficient price signals for dispatch and siting deci-sions. Moreover, nodal prices provide greater economic incentives for the deployment of DG by rewarding DG re-sources for contributions toward reducing losses at the mar-gin through changed power flows. Nodal pricing factors are calculated using power flows locating “the reference bus” at the power supply point where the transmission network connects to the distribution network. We assume no net-work constraints at the distribution level. Finally, we con-clude with an application of this method in a rural radial distribution network...|$|R

It is shown that for a given rms spatial tracking error, an optimal transmitter beamwidth exists which minimizes the probability of bit error. The power penalty associated with the spatial tracking error when the transmitter beamwidth is adjusted to achieve optimal performance is shown to be large (greater than 9 dB) when the rms pointing jitter becomes a significant fraction (greater than 30 percent) of the diffraction limited beamwidth. The power penalty due to temporal tracking error, on the other hand, is relatively small (less than 0. 1 dB) when the tracking loop bandwidth is less than 0. 1 percent of the slot frequency.

Some institutions were liquidated, and others were rescued and rehabilitated, depending on their solvency. The government used two types of mechanisms to rehabilitate the banking system.
