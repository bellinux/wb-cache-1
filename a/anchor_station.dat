Before that, Paramount owned a de facto television network, the Paramount Television Network, and had a stake in another network, the DuMont Television Network. Paramount Studios also had outright ownership of KTLA in Los Angeles (the LA station was the <b>anchor</b> <b>station</b> of the PTN). Paramount formerly owned WBKB in Chicago, as part of the Balaban & Katz theatre circuit, but when the company was divided into two by the Paramount case anti-trust action in 1949, the studio kept KTLA and sold WBKB with its other theatre-related properties. The spun-off United Paramount Theatres purchased control of the American Broadcasting Company, and due to legal requirements sold WBKB-TV (now WBBM) to CBS.|$|E
40|$|Validation is {{the process}} through which {{reliability}} of remote sensing products and algorithms can be assessed. For that, {{it is necessary to}} intercompare the data provided by different sensors with independent measurements directly obtained from the ground. Since 2002, the Valencia <b>Anchor</b> <b>Station</b> and, more recently, since 2005, the Alacant <b>Anchor</b> <b>Station,</b> both are being used for validation activities in the context of remote sensing Earth Observation Missions such as CERES (Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System) and GERB (Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget), and being prepared for the SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) and EPS/MetOp (EUMETSAT Polar System) Missions. All these missions have in common the low spatial resolution of their respective footprint and the necessity to count on a well characterised and instrumented reasonably homogeneous large area. Both Anchor Stations are placed in different climatic areas within the Region of Valencia, in Spain. Thus the Valencia <b>Anchor</b> <b>Station</b> is placed over the natural region of La Plana de Utiel-Requena Plateau (province of Valencia), whereas the Alacant <b>Anchor</b> <b>Station</b> is placed over the natural region of Vinalopó Mitjà (province of Alicante), the agricultural area objectively most degraded of the Valenci...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The net {{ecosystem}} {{exchange of}} carbon dioxide was modelled based on Eddy Covariance (EC) measurements {{of carbon dioxide}} fluxes above an old spruce stand at the <b>Anchor</b> <b>Station</b> Tharandt/Germany (since 1996) and long-term meteorological and hydrological observations of an adjacent water catchment (Wernersbach). The modelling itself {{is based on a}} regression analysis between the net CO 2 exchange at the <b>Anchor</b> <b>Station</b> and the canopy conductance of the watershed on a daily scale. First model results that used a canopy conductance obtained from the Penman-Monteith equation could be improved by using the combined Shuttleworth-Wallace resistances. The model results are presented and compared with measured data and annual wood increments obtained from tree ring analysis. Results from this study suggest that a coupling of water and carbon cycle, or water vapour and carbon exchange, respectively, can prove to be a successful way of modelling the ecosystems carbon exchange...|$|E

ESA's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission will deliver, {{as one of its}} main goals, global fields of surface soil moisture with an accuracy better than 0. 04 m 3 m&minus; 3 . SMOS relies on an L-band (1. 4 GHz) interferometric radiometer. Within the context of the preparation for this mission over land, the Valencia <b>Anchor</b> <b>Station</b> (VAS) experimental site, in Spain, was selected {{to be one of the}} main test sites in Europe for the SMOS Calibration/Validation (Cal/Val) activities. This study presents preliminary analysis of PERSIANN in the framework of SMOS Cal/Val activities at the Valencia <b>Anchor</b> <b>Station.</b> The PERSIANN database is an automated system for Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks. The real interest of using the PERSIANN database into the hydrologic applications is mainly with the goal of having access to the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation over a significant area (typically here an area equivalent to a SMOS pixel). The goal of this study is to quantify the gain of using PERSIANN instead of distributing sparse rain gauge measurements. The interest of using satellite rainfall estimates as well as the influence that the precipitation events can induce on the modelling of the water content in the soil was depicted by a comparison between different soil moisture products. Having an accurate estimation of the amount and temporal/spatial distribution of precipitation is a critical issue so as to have a faithful representation of the soil moisture distribution...|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} of the SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) mission is to deliver global fields of surface soil {{moisture}} and sea surface salinity using L-band (1. 4 GHz) radiometry. Within {{the context of the}} preparation for this mission over land, the Valencia <b>Anchor</b> <b>Station</b> experimental site, in Spain, was chosen {{to be one of the}} main test sites in Europe for the SMOS Calibration/Validation (Cal/Val) activities. Ground and meteorological measurements over the area are used as the input of a Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere-Transfer (SVAT) model, SURFEX (Externalized Surface) -module ISBA (Interactions between Soil-Biosphere-Atmosphere) so as to simulate the surface soil moisture. The calibration as well as the validation of the ISBA model was made using in situ soil moisture measurements. It is shown that a good consistency was reached when point comparisons between simulated and in situ soil moisture measurements were made. In order to obtain an accurate soil moisture mapping over the Valencia <b>Anchor</b> <b>Station</b> (50 &times; 50 km 2 area), a spatialization method has been applied. To validate the approach, a comparison with remote sensing data from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on Earth observing System (AMSR-E) and from the European Remote Sensing Satellites (ERS-Scat) was performed. Despite the fact that AMSR-E surface soil moisture product is not reproducing accurately the absolute values, it provides trustworthy information on surface soil moisture temporal variability. However, during the vegetation growing season the signal is perturbed. By using the polarization ratio a better agreement is obtained. ERS-Scat soil moisture products were also used to be compared with the simulated spatialized soil moisture. The seasonal variations were well reproduced. However, the lack of soil moisture data over the area (45 observations for one year) was a limit into completely understanding the soil moisture variability...|$|E

It was showed that PH and total alkalinity took on clear spatial variations in values with the minima in the low salinity region. Like salinity, transect distributions of PH and total alkalinity (TA) in a downriver direction had a sharp gradient each. These gradients appeared in such a sequence that the TA gradient was earlier than salinity and PH gradients, and the salinity gradient was earlier than the PH gradient. These distribution characteristics seemed to be strongly influenced by the mixing process of freshwater and seawater, for both PH and total alkalinity had significant linear relationships with salinity and temperature. For PH, phytoplankton activities also {{had a significant impact}} upon its spatial distribution. During a period of 48 h, PH and total alkalinity changed within wide ranges for every layer of the two <b>anchor</b> <b>stations,</b> namely, Stas 13 and 20, which were located at the mixed water mass and seawater mass, respectively. For both Stas 13 and 20, PH and TA fluctuation of every layer could be very wide during a 4 h period. As a whole, the data of the two <b>anchor</b> <b>stations</b> showed that neither variations in salinity and temperature nor phytoplankton activities were the main factors strongly influencing the total alkalinity temporal variability on a small time scale.
