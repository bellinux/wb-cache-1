500|$|Hillenburg {{enjoyed the}} process of making the film: [...] "The TV {{schedule}} is tight, and you don't always {{have a lot of time}} to work on your drawings." [...] He appreciated the film's hand-drawn animation: [...] "I think the movie's drawings are much superior than the TV show", although CGI animation was flourishing at the time of the film's release. [...] "There's <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> 2-D being dead, and I hope people don't think that. Even Brad Bird is a proponent of 2-D. He would agree with me that it's all about what you're trying to say. There are many ways to tell a story, and what's unique about animation is that there are many styles with which to tell a story." [...] The clay animation scenes were shot by Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh and Chris Finnegan at Screen Novelties in Los Angeles.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the album's {{thematic}} content, Daniel Rossen noted, [...] "There's <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> negotiating {{distance from}} people in your life. We were dealing with that in various forms, learning {{what it means to}} be alone, learning {{what it means to be}} close to somebody, certain things coming to a head. It just feels like a major difficulty in life." [...] Droste elaborated, [...] "There's a desire to be autonomous, but there's also this great fear of being alone, and there's this constant feeling of, 'How do you reconcile this?' There's this need for space, but there's also this, 'Come closer come closer.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|By August 1999, {{the band}} had {{recorded}} over 30 songs for the album, tentatively titled 2000 Intentions. During a 1999 interview with MTV's Kurt Loder, Rose announced {{the title of}} the upcoming album to be Chinese Democracy, stating [...] "there's a lot of Chinese democracy movements, and it's something that there's <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> and it's something that will be nice to see. It could also just be like an ironic statement. I don't know, I just like the sound of it." [...] Rose also mentioned the album would feature [...] "lot of different sounds. There's some heavy songs, there's a lot of aggressive songs, but they're all in different styles and different sounds. It is truly a melting pot." ...|$|E

2500|$|Donegal's defence {{of their}} All-Ireland title began against Tyrone on 26 May 2013. The match was billed in advance as the toughest contest Donegal would face in Ulster, with the winner thought {{likely to become}} Ulster champions. Donegal brushed aside Tyrone with {{relative}} ease. McGuinness said afterwards: [...] "In {{the last two years}} the exact same thing was said. The only difference this year was that we were relegated [...] There was <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> putting all the eggs into one basket, but it was the same last year and the same the year before. That's what we do – it's championship football. It will be no different next year. It was a media spin that got the whole debate going. Next year we will put all our eggs in that basket again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the opening}} tip, Bryant and O'Neal did not talk, but did greet {{each other by}} bumping forearms. During the game, Bryant was fouled by O'Neal several times but the {{contacts}} were not excessive. O'Neal fouled out late {{in the fourth quarter}} but the Heat still won the game in overtime, led by up-and-coming star, Dwyane Wade. Bryant missed a potentially game-winning shot as time expired. When asked about the brick wall comment, Bryant said, [...] "I knew there was <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the brick wall and all that. But I think that was kind of just to hype the game. Hopefully, this is all behind us now." [...] O'Neal shared a similar tone, saying [...] "I'm over it. It's old news to me." [...] Bryant and O'Neal met on the court twice more during the season, once during the NBA All-Star Game and once more when the Lakers played the Heat on March 17, 2005.|$|E
2500|$|Gandhi {{insisted that}} the {{conviction}} did not undermine her position, despite having been unseated from the lower house of parliament, Lok Sabha, by order of the High Court. She said: [...] "There is <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> our government not being clean, but from our experience the situation was very much worse when [...] parties were forming governments". And she dismissed criticism of the way her Congress Party raised election campaign money, saying all parties used the same methods. The prime minister retained the support of her party, which issued a statement backing her. After news of the verdict spread, hundreds of supporters demonstrated outside her house, pledging their loyalty. Indian High Commissioner BK Nehru said Gandhi's conviction would not harm her political career. [...] "Mrs Gandhi has still today overwhelming support in the country," [...] he said. [...] "I believe {{the prime minister of}} India will continue in office until the electorate of India decides otherwise".|$|E

More than that, we couldn't improve the mills themselves, unless we laid down Turkey carpets on the floors. Which we're not a-going to do.' ...|$|E

He's a desperate sort of person--I think that's rather, refreshing; and you know I do think she's a little like him in that!" ...|$|E

The {{impression}} he gave me was of a sort of vague, intermediate state, a special reserve for souls too non-existent for anything so positive as either sin or virtue. I don't know. He was much too egotistical and unobservant to give me any clear idea {{of the kind of}} place, kind of country, there is on the Other Side of Things. Wherever he was, he seems to have fallen in with a set of kindred spirits: ghosts of weak Cockney young men, who were on a footing of Christian names, and among these there was certainly <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> 'going haunting' and things like that. Yes--going haunting! They seemed to think 'haunting' a tremendous adventure, and most of them funked it all the time. And so primed, you know, he had come." ...|$|E

Lindsay also said: [...] "Some of the issues we didn't even know were necessarily there until we were faced with this opportunity {{that we have to}} work together again, then we were like, 'Oh, OK, {{in order for us to}} do this then we have to sort a few things out.' It all just came up. It's been difficult to get to this point. There's been <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talking,</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talking.</b> But we're here now.
