5|$|Daylight saving time (abbreviated DST), {{commonly}} referred to as daylight savings time in speech, and known as summer time in some countries, is the practice of advancing clocks during summer months so that evening daylight lasts longer, while sacrificing normal sunrise times. Typically, regions that use daylight saving time adjust clocks forward one hour close to the start of spring <b>and</b> <b>adjust</b> them backward in the autumn to standard time.|$|E
5|$|The console {{can monitor}} its {{internal}} temperature <b>and</b> <b>adjust</b> accordingly to prevent overheating; alongside increasing fan speed, additional measures can be taken, including forcing the hardware {{to run in}} a lower power state—a feature that was not present on Xbox 360.

5|$|The {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves {{control all}} intrinsic {{muscles of the}} larynx except for the cricothyroid muscle. These muscles act to open, close, <b>and</b> <b>adjust</b> the tension of the vocal cords, and include the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles, the only muscle to open the vocal cords. The nerves supply muscles {{on the same side}} of the body, with the exception of the interarytenoid muscle, which is innervated from both sides.|$|E

5|$|Bravely Default, {{known in}} Japan as Bravely Default: Flying Fairy, is a {{role-playing}} video game developed by Silicon Studio for the Nintendo 3DS handheld video game console. Bravely Default was originally released in 2012, while an expanded edition titled For the Sequel released in 2013 in Japan, Europe and Australia, and in 2014 in North America. Square Enix published {{the game in}} Japan, while Nintendo handled publishing duties overseas. The gameplay uses a turn-based battle system and job system, in addition to incorporating options to combine job abilities <b>and</b> <b>adjust</b> battle speed and random encounter rates.|$|E
5|$|Mobius Final Fantasy is a {{role-playing}} game {{designed for}} mobile phones. The player controls the game's protagonist Warrior of Light (Wol) while navigating Palamecia. Players can customize settings, graphical quality, <b>and</b> <b>adjust</b> controls for their dominant hand. During local navigation {{on the field}} map, the player taps a location on a map and the character travels to that location. In some self-contained areas, the player can directly control the character. Along with standard navigation, the player can navigate the game world using a fast-travel system, progressively unlocked as the player progresses through the story. Many of the features in the game, such as the leveling system and exploration, {{are similar to those}} from previous home console Final Fantasy games.|$|E
5|$|Silicon carbide, {{dissolved}} in a {{basic oxygen furnace}} used for making steel, acts as a fuel. The additional energy liberated allows the furnace to process more scrap with the same charge of hot metal. It {{can also be used}} to raise tap temperatures <b>and</b> <b>adjust</b> the carbon and silicon content. Silicon carbide is cheaper than a combination of ferrosilicon and carbon, produces cleaner steel and lower emissions due to low levels of trace elements, has a low gas content, and does not lower the temperature of steel.|$|E

5|$|Space Travel is {{an early}} video game {{developed}} by Ken Thompson in 1969 that simulates travel in the solar system. The player flies their ship around a two-dimensional scale model {{of the solar system}} with no objectives other than to attempt to land on various planets and moons. The player can move and turn the ship, <b>and</b> <b>adjust</b> the overall speed by adjusting the scale of the simulation. The ship is affected by the single strongest gravitational pull of the astronomical bodies.|$|E
5|$|The team's {{previous}} experience was with turn-based combat games, and it struggled {{to develop a}} real-time combat system affected by customizable attributes and abilities that provided feedback to the player on how those statistics were affecting the battle. It initially found that by adhering too closely to the White Wolf source material rules for guns, where {{the effectiveness of a}} shot is determined in a contest between the player's skill and the opponent's defense, the firearms seemed broken; the player would not hit where they aimed. Troika found it difficult to mesh the available factors in a real-time setting. Melee combat had to deal with a variety of melee weapons and animations <b>and</b> <b>adjust</b> for melee-on-melee and melee-on-ranged combat.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Sargent and Neil Wallace (1975) applied {{rational}} expectations to models with Phillips curve trade-offs between inflation and output {{and found that}} monetary policy {{could not be used}} to systematically stabilize the economy. Sargent and Wallace's policy ineffectiveness proposition found that economic agents would anticipate inflation <b>and</b> <b>adjust</b> to higher price levels before the influx of monetary stimulus could boost employment and output. Only unanticipated monetary policy could increase employment, and no central bank could systematically use monetary policy for expansion without economic agents catching on and anticipating price changes before they could have a stimulative impact.|$|E

5|$|A {{music video}} was issued in November 2003 {{to promote the}} single. The video shows Sebastian on a TV set as it is being {{prepared}} for a show. He is dressed casually in jeans and windcheater. He sits on boxes as he begins to sing with a camera crew starting to film him. An image {{of a young woman}} is shown as he continues. Various personnel walk around him <b>and</b> <b>adjust</b> the set. Sebastian stands and the image of the female is seen again, she wears white feathers. Later, Sebastian is dressed more formally in a white suit as he performs the song. On this set are plasma screens depicting the same young woman. The video ends with Sebastian in his casual gear again, sitting on the boxes. The video was produced by Australian Idols Stephen Tate and directed by the show's musical director, John Foreman. On 22 November, the clip was premiered on Network Ten's Video Hits – which had Tate as executive producer.|$|E
5|$|Some {{mainframe}} {{games that}} did not appear in 101 BASIC Computer Games have still had a lasting impact. One such game was Space Travel, developed by Ken Thompson in 1969, which simulates travel in the Solar System. The player flies their ship around a two-dimensional scale model {{of the solar system}} with no objectives other than to attempt to land on various planets and moons. The player can move and turn the ship, <b>and</b> <b>adjust</b> the overall speed by adjusting the scale of the simulation. The ship is affected by the single strongest gravitational pull of the astronomical bodies. The game was developed at Bell Labs, and was ported during 1969 from the Multics operating system to the GECOS operating system on the GE 635 computer, and then to the PDP-7 minicomputer. While porting the game to the PDP-7, Thompson developed ideas for his own operating system, which later formed the core of the Unix operating system. Space Travel never spread beyond Bell Labs or had an effect on future games, leaving its primary legacy as part of the original push for the development of Unix.|$|E
5|$|The NZ ETS covers {{forestry}} (a net sink), energy (42% {{of total}} 2012 emissions), industry (7% of total 2012 emissions) and waste (5% of total 2012 emissions) but not pastoral agriculture (46% of 2012 total emissions). Participants in the NZ ETS must surrender one emission unit (either an international 'Kyoto' unit or a New Zealand-issued unit) for every two tonnes {{of carbon dioxide}} equivalent emissions reported or they may choose to buy NZ units from the government at a fixed price of NZ$25.The one-for-two transional measure will be phased out evenly across relevant sectors over three years from 1 January 2017. The old 50 percent surrender obligation increased to 67 percent from 1 January 2017, and will increase to 83 percent from 1 January 2018, and a full surrender obligation from 1 January 2019 for all sectors in the NZ ETS. This phased approach gives businesses time to plan <b>and</b> <b>adjust,</b> and supports a more stable market.|$|E

5|$|The {{operator}} interface {{provides a means}} for an operator to start and stop the motor <b>and</b> <b>adjust</b> the operating speed. Additional operator control functions might include reversing, and switching between manual speed adjustment and automatic control from an external process control signal. The {{operator interface}} often includes an alphanumeric display and/or indication lights and meters {{to provide information about}} the operation of the drive. An operator interface keypad and display unit is often provided {{on the front of the}} VFD controller as shown in the photograph above. The keypad display can often be cable-connected and mounted a short distance from the VFD controller. Most are also provided with input and output (I/O) terminals for connecting push buttons, switches, and other operator interface devices or control signals. A serial communications port is also often available to allow the VFD to be configured, adjusted, monitored, and controlled using a computer.|$|E
5|$|Until World War II, dining at Vassar was {{an elegant}} affair with table linens and serving maids, {{but after the}} war was over, these {{features}} were never brought back to student life. In 1973, the All Campus Dining Center, also called the ACDC or the Deece, opened within the building, serving as a replacement to individual dining rooms {{in each of the}} college's dormitories. The old system had proved too costly and overcrowded, necessitating the ACDC's creation. The $3.5 million renovation was conducted by Walker O. Cain and Associates, with over $1 million of the funds coming from friends and family of Babbott Ladd. An $11 million renovation in 2003 was designed by Finegold Alexander + Associates Inc. Another project, to renovate the kitchen of the Dining Center <b>and</b> <b>adjust</b> the locations of the building's bathrooms, is underway as of 2016. The changes, undertaken by LTL Architects, total $8–9 million.|$|E
5|$|Milius {{recruited}} his friend, Basil Poledouris, {{to produce}} the score for Conan; they had had a successful collaboration on Big Wednesday. The film industry's usual practice was to contract a composer to start work after the main scenes had been filmed, but Milius hired Poledouris before principal photography had started. The composer was {{given the opportunity to}} compose the film's music based on the initial storyboards and to modify it throughout filming before recording the score near the end of production. Poledouris made extensive use of Musync, a music and tempo editing hardware and software system invented by Robert Randles (subsequently nominated for an Oscar for Scientific Achievement), to modify the tempo of his compositions and synchronize them with the action in the film. The system helped make his job easier and faster; it could automatically adjust tempos when the user changed the positioning of beats. In the montage where Conan grows up, for example, Poledouris had Randles prepare, over the phone, a long accelerando that landed on precise moments in the picture along the way. Poledouris would otherwise have had to conduct the orchestra <b>and</b> <b>adjust</b> his compositions on the fly. Conan is the first film to list Musync in its credits.|$|E
