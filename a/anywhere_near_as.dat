Her father, Nicolas Calment (28 January 1838 – 22 January 1931), was a shipbuilder, and her mother, Marguerite Gilles (20 February 1838 – 18 September 1924), was {{from a family of}} millers. She had an older brother, François (25 April 1865 – 1 December 1962). Some of her close family members also lived an above-average lifespan, {{although}} none lived <b>anywhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>as</b> long as Jeanne: her older brother François lived to the age of 97, her father to six days shy of 93, and her mother to 86.|$|E
25|$|Radio sports {{coverage}} is also important. The BBC's Radio Five Live broadcasts almost all major sports events. It {{now has a}} commercial rival called TalkSport, but this has not acquired <b>anywhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>as</b> many exclusive contracts as Sky Sports. BBC Local Radio also provides extensive coverage of sport, giving more exposure to second-tier clubs which get limited national coverage.|$|E

In the book he entertains each member of Dorothy's party on a different day, and takes a different form for each; appearing as a giant green head, a beautiful fairy, a great beast, and a levitating ball of fire. In the movie he takes {{only one of these}} forms—that of the giant green head.|$|E

500|$|Within {{the occult}} community, Valiente has become internationally {{known as the}} [...] "Mother of Modern Witchcraft" [...] or [...] "Mother of Wica", {{although}} she herself disliked this moniker. Heselton believed that Valiente's influence on Wicca was [...] "profound and far-reaching", while Ruickbie characterised her as Gardner's [...] "most gifted acolyte".

500|$|Uwe Reinhardt, a Princeton health economist, wrote. [...] "The rigid, {{artificial}} rules {{under which}} the Congressional Budget Office must score proposed legislation unfortunately cannot produce the best unbiased forecasts of the likely fiscal impact of any legislation", but {{went on to say}} [...] "But even if the budget office errs significantly in its conclusion that the bill would actually help reduce the future federal deficit, I doubt that the financing of this bill will be <b>anywhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>as</b> fiscally irresponsible as was the financing of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003." [...] Douglas Holtz-Eakin, CBO director during the George W. Bush administration, who later served as the chief economic policy adviser to U.S. Senator John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign, alleged that the bill would increase the deficit by $562billion because, he argued, it front-loaded revenue and back-loaded benefits.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. The two wrote that, while [...] "it lacks Vince Gilligan's trademark wit", the episode takes the plot threads started in [...] "Pusher" [...] to their [...] "logical conclusions". Shearman and Pearson explained that the episode's acting, most notably that of Robert Wisden and Diana Scarwid, [...] "helps raise 'Kitsunegari' above the average." [...] Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it a C+. He wrote that, despite his love for [...] "Pusher", [...] "'Kitsunegari' isn't <b>anywhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>as</b> good as its predecessor". Handlen cited the change in Modell's personality, his lack {{of a desire to}} kill, and Scully's portrayal as a [...] "humorless scold who only sees the truth when required to for narrative convenience" [...] as reasons why the episode was weak. He concluded that [...] "Kitsunegari" [...] was [...] "not very well put together".|$|E
50|$|Caesar {{decided that}} the city could not be carried by force. This was {{a problem for the}} Romans because they had also been told by deserters that the city had an {{abundant}} food supply, despite the previous blunders of Luciterius and Drapes. Caesar decided therefore to target the city's water supply. The terrain of the fort was such that {{it would be impossible to}} divert the river <b>anywhere</b> <b>near</b> Uxellodunum, <b>as</b> the water flowed almost directly from the mountain down into the valley, making digging diversion canals infeasible. Caesar, however, noticed the difficulty the Gauls had collecting the water, having to come down a very steep slope to reach the riverbank. Exploiting this potential flaw in the defenses, Caesar stationed archers and balista near the river to cover any attempt to gather water from this main source.|$|R

The last chance at a bound book of yours was in London nearly two years ago--the last volume of your short things, by the Harpers.

2500|$|Rowling cites Jane Austen as her {{favourite}} {{author and}} a major influence. Rowling has said: [...] "My attitude to Jane Austen is accurately summed up by that wonderful line from Cold Comfort Farm: 'One of the disadvantages of almost universal education was that {{all kinds of people}} gained a familiarity with one's favourite books. It gave one a curious feeling; like seeing a drunken stranger wrapped in one's dressing gown.'" [...] The Harry Potter series is known for its twist endings, and Rowling has stated that, [...] "I have never set up a surprise ending in a Harry Potter book without knowing I can never, and will never, do it <b>anywhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>as</b> well as Austen did in Emma." ...|$|E
3000|$|I {{have become}} less {{enthusiastic}} about that idea now. It’s {{virtually impossible to}} expect people to speak in one accent, Creating a global region-free accent and a global Standard English is very unfair and very unduly difficult task to put upon them. Every country has their own important cultural traits and unique linguistic elements that they bring into their version of English. So, it’s difficult to distil those things. One {{of the ways to}} express your culture is via language. And thinking about the offences that teaching only variety of Standard English cause in eradicating those cultures…like how you did to us in that activity [laughter]…that activity and the discussion made me think seriously about those issues. Like the indigenous Aborigines, I now really understand how they feel about the teaching and learning of Standard Australian English… I'm sure if you told the dreamtime story in Standard Australian English, it wouldn't sound <b>anywhere</b> <b>nearest</b> good <b>as</b> it's told in like the actual tongue or their version of Standard English it's designed to be told in, I think this goes for everybody, really!

40|$|Deep {{learning}} techniques provide powerful {{methods for}} the development of deep structured projections connecting multiple domains of data. But the fine-tuning of such net-works for supervised problems is challenging, and many current approaches are therefore heavily reliant on pre-training, which consists of unsupervised processing on the input observation data. In previous work, we have in-vestigated using magnitude spectra as the network obser-vations, finding reasonable improvements over standard acoustic representations. However, in necessarily super-vised problems such as music emotion recognition, {{there is no guarantee that}} the starting points for optimization are <b>anywhere</b> <b>near</b> optimal, <b>as</b> emotion is unlikely to be the most dominant aspect of the data. In this new work, we develop input representations using harmonic/percussive source separation designed to inform rhythm and melodic contour. These representations are beat synchronous, pro-viding an event-driven representation, and potentially the ability to learn emotion informative representations from pre-training alone. In order to provide a large dataset for our pre-training experiments, we select a subset of 50, 000 songs from the Million Song Dataset, and employ their 30 - 60 second preview clips from 7 digital to compute our cus-tom feature representations. 1...|$|R

He had seen Happy Jack the very first thing, and he had guessed right away that Happy Jack was spying on him so as to find out if he had any of the big, fat hickory nuts. Now Striped Chipmunk had all of those fat hickory nuts safely hidden in his splendid new storehouse, but he didn't intend to let Happy Jack know it.

2500|$|Furman was an {{exceptional}} openings specialist, and was respected as being of virtually world-class strength with the White pieces, {{with which he}} scored most of his wins over the top players, as the game selection shows. He was {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "the world champion when playing White." [...] He could not score <b>anywhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>as</b> well as Black, and this held back his success. While best remembered today as Karpov's trainer, Furman also made many important contributions to the success of other top players, such as Bronstein, Botvinnik, Korchnoi, and Geller. He developed several significant improvements to opening theory. He favoured the closed openings (1.d4, 1.c4, 1.Nf3) as White, and in many of his wins over top-class rivals, his opponents were simply unable to generate counterplay, and were slowly strangled by Furman's precise, yet amorphous strategy. Karpov noted that a book on Furman's career and best games would be well received and valuable; but no one has yet taken up this challenge.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2013, Electronic Arts {{announced}} that it was reducing support for the Wii U and had no games in development for it, but then partially reconsidered this decision a few days later, with EA's CFO announcing that [...] "We are building titles for the Nintendo console, but not <b>anywhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>as</b> many as we are for PlayStation or Xbox". At E3 2013, Ubisoft revealed that it was not going to make any more exclusives for the Wii U until sales of the console improved, though it stated shortly after that it was still a [...] "big supporter" [...] of the Wii U, and planned to release as many Wii U games in 2013 as it did in 2012. In July 2013, Bethesda Softworks {{announced that}} it had no games in development for the Wii U, with Bethesda VP of PR and marketing Pete Hines explaining: [...] "It depends on the games that we are making and how we think it aligns with that console, and how the hardware aligns with the other stuff we are making". This explanation was later refined to being largely due to the hardware. Contrarily, Activision has stated that it will [...] "do everything they can" [...] to support the system.|$|E
2500|$|Play {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 84, based on 20 reviews. In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau said the album's sampled recordings would not [...] "shout <b>anywhere</b> <b>near</b> <b>as</b> loud and clear" [...] without Moby's [...] "ministrations—his grooves, his pacing, his textures, his harmonies, sometimes his tunes, and mostly his grooves, which honor not just dance music {{but the entire}} rock tradition it's part of." [...] He deemed the album [...] "no more focused" [...] than Moby's previous [...] "brilliant messes" [...] but still [...] "one of those records whose drive to beauty should move anybody who just likes, well, music itself." [...] AllMusic's John Bush felt Play showed Moby [...] "balancing his sublime early sound with the breakbeat techno evolution of the '90s". Barry Walters from Rolling Stone said [...] "the {{ebb and flow of}} eighteen concise, contrasting cuts writes a story about Moby's beautifully conflicted interior world while giving the outside planet beats and tunes on which to groove." [...] David Browne, writing in Entertainment Weekly, said despite some needed editing, Moby's graceful soundscapes filter out the original recordings' antiquated sound and [...] "make the singers' heartache and hope seem fresh again." [...] In a mixed review, Pitchfork critic Brent DiCrescenzo believed the [...] "raw magnetism" [...] of the sampled recordings was lost to [...] "innate digital recording techniques", resulting in music that was [...] "fun and functional, yet disposable." ...|$|E
50|$|These laws {{assume that}} the pump/fan {{efficiency}} remains constant i.e. , which is rarely exactly true, but {{can be a good}} approximation when used over appropriate frequency or diameter ranges (i.e., a fan will not move <b>anywhere</b> <b>near</b> 1000 times <b>as</b> much air when spun at 1000 times its designed operating speed, but the air movement may be increased by 99% when the operating speed is only doubled). The exact relationship between speed, diameter, and efficiency depends on the particulars of the individual fan or pump design. Product testing or computational fluid dynamics become necessary if the range of acceptability is unknown, or if a high level of accuracy is required in the calculation. Interpolation from accurate data is also more accurate than the affinity laws. When applied to pumps the laws work well for constant diameter variable speed case (Law 1) but are less accurate for constant speed variable impeller diameter case (Law 2).|$|R

2500|$|Megatsunamis {{have quite}} {{different}} features from other, more usual types of tsunamis. Most tsunamis {{are caused by}} underwater tectonic activity (movement of the earth's plates) and therefore occur along plate boundaries {{and as a result}} of earthquake and rise or fall in the sea floor, causing water to be displaced. Ordinary tsunamis have shallow waves out at sea, and the water piles up to a wave height of up to about 10 metres (33 feet) as the sea floor becomes shallow near land. By contrast, megatsunamis occur when a very large amount of material suddenly falls into water or <b>anywhere</b> <b>near</b> water (such <b>as</b> via a meteor impact), or are caused by volcanic activity. They can have extremely high initial wave heights of hundreds and possibly thousands of metres, far beyond any ordinary tsunami, as the water is [...] "splashed" [...] upwards and outwards by the impact or displacement. As a result, two heights are sometimes quoted for megatsunamis – the height of the wave itself (in water), and the height to which it surges when it reaches land, which depending upon the locale, can be several times larger.|$|R
