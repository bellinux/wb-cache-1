60|$|The {{inspector}} was a kind-hearted man: {{he lived}} {{at the office and}} his wife was the housekeeper. He had already given her an account, an interesting account, of his female prisoner. The good woman's imagination was touched as well as her heart; she had herself suggested that they ought to soften the rigour of the fair prisoner's lot; and the inspector therefore almost anticipated the request of Gerard. He begged Sybil to accompany him to his better half, and at once promised all the comforts and convenience which they could command. As, attended by the inspector, she took her way to the apartments of his family, they passed through a room in which there were writing materials, and Sybil speaking {{for the first time and}} in a faint voice enquired of the inspector whether it were permitted to apprise a friend of her situation. She was answered in the <b>affirmative,</b> on <b>condition</b> that the note was previously perused by him.|$|R
40|$|Three {{hundred and}} twenty {{men and women were}} exposed to five levels of {{conventional}} sexism and affirmative action-induced discrimination. No perceptual minimisation of discrimination was found: instead participants linearly maximised the impact of discrimination. New measures of emotional responses to discrimination revealed changes in both internal (depression) and external (anger) negative affect, with varying intensities of anger and depression directed at different targets. Similarly, new measures of behavioural reactions to discrimination revealed more antinormative and collectivistic behavioural intentions than previous research. Minute but consistent effects of frame condition were observed in each sample. Finally, clear differences emerged between the responses of men and women, and between responses in the conventional and <b>affirmative</b> action-induced discrimination <b>conditions...</b>|$|R

In this paper, we remove the restriction by extending the application of algebraic group theory. We also obtain generalizations to subgroups of small nilpotence class, not necessarily abelian, and to nilpotent Lie algebras over local rings...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the Swedish culture industry and emphasises the ability to structure the projects yet enabling openness for emergent properties in project work in the culture industry. While project management in conventional industry risks being routinised or even bureaucratised, the culture industry is demonstrating a persistent ability to navigate between complementary qualities, thereby maintaining a dynamic project management practice. This virtue is captured by the concept of play, based on the duality of rule-adherence and individual and collective creativity. In the culture industry, structured around a series of temporal 'productions' (e. g., a play, a series of concerts, etc.), uncertainty, complexity, and temporality are factors that influence the work. However, the ideology of the culture industry emphasising expression of ideas and creativity enables a project management practice <b>affirmative</b> of emergent <b>conditions.</b> Thus, the work never ossifies into being merely rule-governed procedures but is balancing the two qualities innate to all play...|$|R
40|$|The article {{deals with}} a problem which is related both to {{morphology}} and syntax. Particular attention has been drawn to the relations of the morpheme nie to the nominal predicate. Here we distinguish negative sentences which can be transformed to positive utterances by eliminating the negation factor and we point to possible positive structures which can be transformed to negative by negating the predicate. From the syntactic point of view the morpheme nie is a shifting unit i. e. it can be connected with either a predicative or a copula. This flexibility results from the possibility of joining the morpheme with predicative developing words, particularly with the adverbial bardzo. We have also described sentences which can be transformed to <b>affirmative</b> under the <b>condition</b> of certain lexical changes {{and there have been}} distinguished utterances with no positive equivalent as they can be expressed only by negated structures. Some structures are impossible to transform because of their idiomatic character. Zadanie pt.

40|$|Abstract. We {{construct}} {{an example of}} a continuous non-constant function f: X → R defined on a connected complete metric space X such that every point x ∈ X is a point of local minimum or local maximum for f. Also we show that any such a space X should have the network weight and the weak separate number nw(X) ≥ R(X) ≥ c. This note is motivated by the following problem of M. Wójcik [Wój], [MW] (see also [BGN, Question 7]) on the nature of locally extremal functions on connected spaces. We define a function f: X → R on a topological space X to be locally extremal if each point x ∈ X is a point of local minimum or local maximum for f. Problem 1. Is a each locally extremal continuous function f: X → R on a connected metric space X constant? In [BGN] this problem has been answered in <b>affirmative</b> under the <b>condition</b> that the density of the connected metric space X is strictly smaller than c, the size of continuum. In fact, this result is a particular case a more general theorem treating locally extremal functions on connected topological spaces X with the wea...|$|R
40|$|Who {{should be}} the {{beneficiaries}} of racially targeted affirmative action? In its Croson decision, the Supreme Court answered part of the “Who Question” when it <b>conditioned</b> <b>affirmative</b> action eligibility on underrepresentation. What the Court did not tell us was underrepresentation of whom? The Court thus instructs us to select beneficiary groups by counting heads, but leaves open which heads get counted where and what categories to use. By artificially separating what are necessarily related inquiries, the Court left a definitional lacuna that lower courts have struggled to fill. Such definitional issues matter because they often determine who benefits from affirmative action. Yet, the inconsistent approaches and conflicting outcomes in recent case law reveals the inadequacy of current doctrine to resolve such issues. While commentators have largely ignored the Who Question in the US, recent comparative scholarship has drawn attention to empirical methodologies used in India. In contrast to the particularized discrimination targeted by Croson, India has explicitly adopted a societal approach to affirmative action that relies on empirical data to identify subordinated groups through sociological analysis. A recent amicus brief filed before the US Supreme Court suggested that the US adopt India’s model {{as the answer to}} our Who Question. This Article critiques the amicus proposal, arguing that India’s approach does not provide a workable solution. Nor would it be desirable even if it could. Pressing the ambiguities of race would expose the normative incoherence of affirmative action {{in a way that would}} prove politically untenable. However, even if India’s model cannot help us answer the “Who Question,” it does have some more modest uses. It offers both a definitional tool to improve the categories we count with and a model for allocating decisional authority between courts and political actors...|$|R
40|$|Adultery is proved {{only through}} {{numerous}} and frequent confessions (four times) and confession {{to less than}} that would not invoke legal punishment (ḥadd). This view is widely accepted by the Imāmī jurists. Among them, however, is Ibn ‘Aqīl ‘Ammānī who stands against the widely accepted view and believes that such crimes are provable {{by means of a}} single confession. By reappraising this issue and analyzing and evaluating the evidences of both views, the writer takes on a third theory. In brief, the writer believes that a single confession would suffice for proving the adultery provided that it meets all the conditions of effectiveness. Only the adultery leading to stoning (rajm), in terms of the narrations existing in this regard, requires four independent confessions in order to be proved. Besides enjoying a specific reason, the bulk of this theory is consistent with the generalities of the evidences like the overall rule "the confession of the wise on themselves is admissible", and the latter instance corresponds more with the "principle of precaution in bloodshed". Keywords: adultery, <b>affirmative</b> evidences, imposing <b>condition</b> (ishtirāt) of numerous confessions, rare verdict. زنا، تنها به واسطه تعدد و تکرر اقرار (چهاردفعه) اثبات می‌شود و اقرار به کمتر از آن موجب ثبوت حد نیست. این نظریه‌ای است که مشهور فقهای امامیه بدان قائلند. در این‌میان، ابن ابی عقیل عمانی در برابر جریان مشهور قرار گرفته و معتقد است این‌گونه جرائم به-وسیله یک اقرار نیز قابل اثبات است. نویسنده با بازخوانی این مسئله و با تحلیل و ارزیابی مدارک و مستندات هر دو قول، نظریه سومی را اختیار نموده است. نویسنده اجمالاً معتقد است یک اقرار اگر واجد تمام شرایط نفوذ باشد، برای اثبات زنا کافی است. تنها در زنای موجب رجم به دلیل وجود روایات در این زمینه، اثبات آن محتاج چهار اقرار مستقل است. اصل و صدر این نظریه علاوه بر دارا بودن دلیل خاص، با عمومات و اطلاقات ادلّه نظیر عموم«اقرار العقلاء علی انفسهم جایز» سازگار است و فقره پایانی آن با «اصل احتیاط در دماء» همخوانی بیشتری دارد. کلید واژه‌ها: زنا ، ادله اثبات ، اقرار ، اشتراط تعدد ، رای شاذ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{intends to}} show an ethical {{perspective}} in the philosophical project of Giorgio Agamben. To sustain this thesis, first of all, it is analyzed {{the condition of}} human life, exposed to the biopolitics logic, a logic characterized by legal, economic, political management and by the technique of life. Understanding this scenario leads to questioning the following: Are there any perspectives to an ethical and happy style of life? If <b>affirmative,</b> in which <b>conditions?</b> Intending to highlight the challenges to think ethics in a biopolitics context, the research looked into, in a second moment, the actuality of Auschwitz, local for production excellence and transformation of man and non-man. Surprisingly, {{it will be able}} to realize that the legal-political structure of Auschwitz remains modern. It is presented the limit in which contemporary biopolitics may reach, which was to produce in a human body the absolute separation between non-man and man. From this thought it is looked into the conception of human from Agamben’s viewpoint, highlighting that what we know as human is a political decision. The hypotheses is that man is a being that shapes his own impotence, being from the potential of no that ethics is placed to be thought. Thirdly, the research deals with the idea that ethics cannot be reduced to rules and regulations. A rule releases an individual from responsibilities for his actions, having as consequence, the separation between life and action, the subjective consciousness and a performed function. An emblematic example of this division is Eichmann, a role model of an employee that has always followed the rules and claimed that in his defense as asked about his responsibility. Against this thinking, the ethical perspective that will be highlighted from Agamben is the one about the construction of a style of life with the potential to resist biopolitical mechanisms. It only makes sense to think about ethics if away from the law, because, if man were or had to be a certain substance or destiny, there would not be ethical experience but duties to be accomplished. The style of life is life able to shape a way of living without being stuck to devices that determine and regulate society. Agamben does not have a systematic ethical theory, but he does not neglect it in his philosophical project. Ethics is the style of life that does not submit easily to previously determined patterns: it is what creates the rule and not the opposite. The rule is an external orientation to a chosen life. The essential is the way by which each person structures, organizes and defines his behaviors. That is what will generate repercussions in the constitution of subjectivity...|$|R
40|$|The {{starting}} {{hypothesis of}} this paper postulates that the two different concepts of the diverse and the intercultural city can be alternatively applied to describe and govern multi-ethnic urban settings, the difference being more matter of scale rather than nature. Diversity and interculturalism share in fact the same duplicity, a normative content combined with an analytic orientation: the former however addresses mainly the ordinary configuration of places, while the latter allows the discussion of rights and political principles. The diverse and the intercultural city are then the same? The answer is <b>affirmative,</b> but the <b>condition</b> is to clear both concepts from ideological deposits. Interculturalism in particular describes the attitude of national governments towards integration, intended as the process of exchange and interaction between the hosting and the immigrant population; at the same, it suggests a normative model for balancing and accepting those exchanges. Interculturalism has gained greater importance recently, and {{has come to be}} seen as a response to the failure of other consolidated integration models, in particular the assimilation one epitomized by France and the multicultural applied in the Netherlands (in part in Germany) and the UK. Italy does not have an explicit model, nor a consistent body of regulation at the national level, and does not fit into such broad categories. However, an hybrid attitude has been identified in its legislation (Zincone in Lucciarini, 2007) : the objective is not one of cultural assimilation, but it is that of granting security and avoiding conflicts in the process of interaction among communities. The Italian approach has been described as that of a ‘reasonable integration’ (ibidem), with civil and social (not political) rights granted to regular immigrants, while no rights at all are recognized to those deemed irregular citizens (a broad category sometimes stretched to accommodate Roma people). Recently, the attitude towards irregulars has become even more restricted, and they often are criminalized. However, generally speaking, this categorization of different integration regimes seems to be ‘narrow’, considering that policies for immigrants are played at the local level, and there they are influenced by processes, actors, interests and local pressures (Caponio, 2006). At the local level, diversity emerges as the narrative concerning cities and specific spaces, being less abstract, and more intertwined with local realities. If the intercultural city is something ‘prescriptive’, top down, it is a matter of policies and management of the complexity of cities; on the contrary, the diverse city is something more ‘phenomenological’, which attains not just at the domain of policies but which accounts as well practices. Social conflicts and political thought have concentrated upon these two dimensions, often bending the reality to serve party agendas or ideologies. Dealing with ordinary cities, diversity appears embedded in the social practices that enact the processes of change and immigration. Such practices not only acknowledge others’ diversity, but construct each and everybody identities. In this latter perspective, diversity is definitely a local feature of society in strong relation with both urban spaces and daily routines. This paper explores the potentiality of the concept of the diverse and intercultural city, sketching rapidly key multiethnic neighbourhoods of Rome as examples of social practices. This exploration is meant to assess how these concepts translate into practices and policies. The aim is a critique of a narrow but prevalent notion of diversity, which is widespread in the planners’ current uses, though misrepresenting intercultural issues; and, on the other side, a defence of diversity as a key tenet for policies dealing with urban spaces...|$|R
