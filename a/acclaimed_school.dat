50|$|Christopher Robin Hebert {{was born}} in Fullerton, California, where he {{has spent most of}} his life. His acting career began when he was allowed to {{audition}} for a local theater production of A Midsummer Night's Dream for one of the parts of the fairies. His mother apparently was reluctant but relented after Hebert's persistence. She had thought that he would not get picked for the part and that this experience would get the acting bug out of his system. However, Hebert got the part and through that summer production, he made connections to a professional agent who got him work in commercials and television before that summer even ended. Hebert continued to work pretty busily for the next five years. His most memorable project came with his feature film debut, The Last Starfighter (1984) as the precocious and likable younger brother, Louis Rogan. Other feature films include The Check Is in the Mail... (1986); a co-starring role for Hebert in a deficient satirical comedy, Invaders from Mars (1986), The Night Before (1988) and Mortuary Academy (1988). Hebert also did numerous episodic appearances, most notably Family Ties (1982), The Twilight Zone (1985) and Fuzz Bucket (1986) (TV)- a Disney TV movie. Hebert's acting career dwindled down during his high school years, an experience fueled by personal problems at home, but one he does not regret now in hindsight. Hebert went on to study film at the University of Southern California's <b>acclaimed</b> <b>School</b> of Cinema-Television, graduating with his B.A. in 1997. During his studies there, he became more and more intrigued with film theory and aesthetics, rather than the technical side of movies. Hebert did star in a low-budget, independent film, Waiting for Mo (1996) made locally in the L.A. area but it was unable to find an audience after its completion.Currently a teacher at Fullerton High School, and summer teacher at Troy High School for History of Motion Pictures.|$|E
