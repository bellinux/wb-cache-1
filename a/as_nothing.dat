Reich argued that conceiving of the orgasm <b>as</b> <b>nothing</b> but mechanical tension and relaxation could not explain why some experience pleasure and others do not. He {{wanted to know what}} additional element had to be present for pleasure to be felt.|$|E

Hawkins accused Nicolls of being overzealous and of overstepping his authority in his personal defence of Redstick Creeks, Seminoles, and their Marron Creole allies, who some Americans in authority viewed <b>as</b> <b>nothing</b> more than runaway slaves and lost or unclaimed property.|$|E

She hoped to lead a useful life independent of her parents, and tentatively considered a career in mycology, but the all-male scientific community regarded her <b>as</b> <b>nothing</b> more than an amateur and she abandoned fungi.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} week, United traveled up the Interstate 95 {{corridor to}} take on their Atlantic Cup rivals, Red Bull New York. The Red Bulls, previously thrashed United 4–0 in April, and looked to be heavy favorites by fans and the media alike, especially coming off a 5–0 home win over Toronto. During the 61st minute of play, De Rosario scored against his former club to give United a 1–0 advantage, which ended up being the match-winning goal. The win means that the Red Bulls have failed to defeat United at home since 2008. In spite of the win, United failed to win the Atlantic Cup trophy {{for the second consecutive}} year, losing 4–1 on aggregate. However, despite winning the Cup for the second straight year, Red Bulls players found the consolation prize <b>as</b> <b>nothing</b> worth meriting about. D.C. continued their streak the following week, drawing 0–0 to FC Dallas at Pizza Hut Park.|$|E

Hitler proposed to do away with all present parties and institutions, even those brought about after centuries of sacrifices and great exertion.

5|$|Emma asks Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) {{about the}} compass and he {{searches}} his records. He finds {{a card that}} supposedly says Michael Tillman purchased the compass, and gives Emma this name. The card is revealed to be blank. Michael is the garage mechanic, and tells Emma he can barely handle the garage let alone twins. Emma {{has no choice but}} to take Ava and Nicholas to Boston on Regina's orders, despite Henry's warnings that no one can leave Storybrooke. That evening as the three are leaving, the vehicle breaks down as they reach the city limits, prompting Emma to call for help. Moments later, Ava notices her compass working. Michael arrives in his tow truck, and Emma explains that he at least has to see his children, as she could not leave Henry after seeing the life he had. Seeing Ava and Nicholas face to face changes his mind, and Michael accepts them into his life. Later, Emma shares Henry's theory with Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin), that she is Snow White's daughter and Mary Margaret is Snow White. Mary finds this laughable, but seeing Emma's blanket triggers some sort of reaction from her. After a minute, however, she is quick to dismiss it <b>as</b> <b>nothing.</b>|$|E

5|$|Lana Tisdel's {{potential}} {{involvement in}} the {{rape and murder of}} Brandon Teena was also highlighted. Various people involved in the case, particularly Brandon's family, have alleged that Tisdel was somehow involved with the murders, or had at least set them up in an act of vengeance. Perhaps the most notable admission about Tisdel's motives came from Tom Nissen, who infamously confessed that Tisdel was present {{at the time of the}} murders in the car and had even tried knocking on the door of the farmhouse where Brandon, Lambert and DeVine were staying. When nobody answered the door, Nissen alleges that Lotter broke in while Tisdel waited in the vehicle while the murders were carried out. Tisdel denied this and a lack of evidence meant that it could not be vigorously pursued in the proceeding court case—the residing judge considered most of Nissen's claims <b>as</b> <b>nothing</b> more than hearsay. Not only did Tisdel vehemently deny any involvement in Brandon's murder, she denied ever being present at Lisa Lambert's farmhouse on the night Brandon was murdered. Unlike Tisdel's own evidence and the admissions presented in court, Boys Don't Cry took the liberty of placing Tisdel at the crime scene, albeit without any intention of setting Brandon up.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{founding}} of the republic, most of the powers of the Curiate Assembly were transferred to the Centuriate Assembly and the Tribal Assembly. While it then fell into disuse, it did retain some theoretical powers, most importantly, the power to ratify elections of the top-ranking Roman Magistrates (Consuls and Praetors) by passing the statute that gave them their legal command authority, the lex curiata de imperio. In practice, however, they actually received this authority from the Centuriate Assembly (which formally elected them), and as such, this functioned <b>as</b> <b>nothing</b> more than a reminder of Rome's regal heritage. Other acts that the Curiate Assembly voted on were mostly symbolic and usually in the affirmative. At one point, possibly as early as 218 BC, the Curiate Assembly's thirty Curia were abolished, and replaced with thirty lictors, one from each of the original Patrician clans. Since the Curia had always been organized {{on the basis of the}} Roman family, the Curiate Assembly actually retained jurisdiction over clan matters even after the fall of the Roman Republic in 27 BC. Under the presidency of the Pontifex Maximus, it witnessed wills and ratified adoptions, inaugurated certain priests, and transferred citizens from Patrician class to Plebeian class (or vice versa). In 44 BC, for example, it ratified the will of Julius Caesar, and with it Caesar's adoption of his nephew Gaius Octavian (the future Roman emperor Augustus) as his son and heir. However, this might not have been the comitia curiata but instead the comitia calata.|$|E
5|$|Three {{potential}} {{sites were}} {{considered for the}} memorial: Albert Square, Piccadilly Gardens and St Peter's Square. With {{the support of the}} Royal British Legion, Albert Square emerged as the favourite. The site proved controversial after the artistic community led the objections to the removal and relocation of statues in the square, which would have been required to create a suitable space for the war memorial. King George V consented to the relocation of the memorial to his German grandfather, Prince Albert, but objections persisted and the city architect estimated the cost of relocating the statues at £8,400. The city council voted to reject Albert Square and identified Piccadilly Gardens as its second choice. The city council was considering building an art gallery on the open space left after the old infirmary was demolished. Siting the memorial in front of it was supported by the Art Gallery Committee. <b>As</b> <b>nothing</b> was decided, any plans for the area would have delayed the war memorial project further and the council settled on St Peter's Square.|$|E

5|$|Tom Hanks is an American {{actor and}} {{producer}} {{who has had}} an extensive career in films, television and on the stage. Hanks made his professional acting debut on the stage playing Grumio, in the Great Lakes Theater production of The Taming of the Shrew (1977). He made his film debut with a minor role in the horror film He Knows You're Alone (1980). In the same year, Hanks appeared in the television series Bosom Buddies. His role in the show led to guest appearances {{on a variety of}} long running television shows including Happy Days. Hanks' appearance on the show led film director Ron Howard to cast him in his first leading role in the fantasy romantic comedy Splash (1984). He went on to host Saturday Night Live {{for the first time in}} 1985 (a show he has since hosted nine times as of 2016), star in films such <b>as</b> <b>Nothing</b> in Common (1986) and Dragnet (1987) before playing his breakthrough role in the age-changing comedy Big (1988). For his performance in the film, Hanks garnered his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor.|$|E
5|$|Felicia Tilman (Harriet Sansom Harris), Martha’s sister, soon {{arrives on}} Wisteria Lane {{to find out}} what {{happened}} to her sister. While inside Paul and Mary Alice’s house, she recognizes a picture of Mary Alice and claims her to be Angela, a nurse she worked with years prior in Utah, but Paul is adamant that she is mistaken. Felicia, however, knows that Mary Alice was in fact Angela and later tells Zach that she knew him when he was a baby, and that his original name was so lovely: Dana. In the first season finale, the mystery behind Mary Alice’s suicide is revealed in full. In March 1990, Todd and Angela Forrest could not conceive and one night a woman named Deirdre Taylor (Jolie Jenkins), a heroin addict whom Angela had treated at the rehabilitation hospital where she worked as a nurse, came to their house looking for money and offered to sell her son to them, to which they eventually agreed. When Deirdre returned to the hospital as a patient soon after and suspicion arose as to where her child was, Angela knew they had to leave town. They moved to Fairview and bought a house on Wisteria Lane, changing their names to Paul, Mary Alice and Zach Young. In 1993, however, Deirdre came to their home, seemingly sober, demanding that she reclaim her son. After a verbal fight, Deirdre went to take her child, when Mary Alice stabbed and killed her. Zach woke up and saw the body, which led to years of his parents brushing off his memories of that night <b>as</b> <b>nothing.</b> Paul and Mary Alice dismembered Deirdre’s body, put it in a toy chest and buried it under their pool. Years later, Martha recognized Mary Alice in a group photo in Felicia’s house, leading to Felicia to tell Martha about how Angela and Todd possibly disappeared with Deirdre’s child and hopefully gave Dana a proper home. Martha then blackmailed Mary Alice and she, in desperation, committed suicide.|$|E
