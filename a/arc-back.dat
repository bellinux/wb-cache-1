One example of the problems caused by backfire occurred in 1960 subsequent to the electrification of the Glasgow North Suburban Railway where steam services had to be re-introduced after several mishaps.

40|$|The Annieopsquotch Accretionary Tract {{comprises}} {{a series}} of <b>arc-back</b> arc complexes and ophiolites that formed in lapetus Ocean and were accreted to the composite Laurentian margin, providing a unique view of tectonic processes operating during the Ordovician Taconic orogeny. The Annieopsquotch ophiolite belt, the oldest and structurally highest complex, preserves three magmatic episodes, and formed during initiation of west-directed subduction. It thus records {{the formation of the}} subduction zone that was responsible for formation of the units preserved in the Annieopsquotch Accretionary Tract. The Annieopsquotch ophiolite belt was accreted to the Laurentian margin prior to 470 Ma along the sinistral-oblique Lloyds River Fault Zone. The Lloyds River Fault Zone was intruded syn-kinematically by two plutonic suites (464 - 459 Ma), which triggered renewed deformation at high temperatures, illustrating that a positive feedback between deformation and magmatism facilitates the transfer of oceanic complexes to continental margins. Age constraints indicate {{that the majority of the}} Annieopsquotch Accretionary Tract was accreted 5 to 10 Ma after formation of the units, illustrating that complexities of accretionary tectonics in lapetus were similar to those in Mesozoic to recent accretionary orogens. In contrast to other accretionary orogens, the role of fore-arc accretion was limited, whereas recycled continental basement played an important role. Syn-kinematic plutons tapped not only a sub-arc mantle source, but also a lithospheric mantle and crustal source, leading to isotopically evolved signatures. The majority of the gabbro zone of the Annieopsquotch ophiolite is composed of gabbroic cumulates with paleohorizontal intrusive contacts. These contacts have finer grain sizes and comb structures (crescumulates), suggesting they are sills. The parental magmas of cumulates in the sills had compositions very similar to the overlying sheeted dykes and basalts, and generally become more evolved up-section, indicating that magma evolution in the Annieopsquotch ophiolite was dominated by fractionation in lower crustal conduits. The parental magmas of the gabbros, sheeted dykes, and basalts preserve a similar, wide range of compositions, indicating that aggregation, homogenization, and fractionation in an axial melt lens was inefficient. Lower crustal accretion was thus dominated by intrusion of melts from below, rather than remobilization of cumulates from above...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} dissertation, we study, the {{metamorphic}} evolution and petrogenetic {{history of the}} protoliths of the metamorphic rocks of Eastern Attica. The metamorphic complex of Eastern Attica respresents the NW part of Attic-Cycladic Crystalline zone, comprised by the Upper Tectonic Unit (UTU) and the Lower Tectonic Unit (LTU). In this study we use thermobarometric methods (multi-equilibrium method, chlorite thermometry, chlorite-chloritoid thermometry, phengite barometry, pseudosections and graphite thermometry) geochemical plots {{have been used in}} order to evaluate the role of various petrological processes which induce the geochemical characteristics of the protoliths of the metabasites and gneisses. The zonation of blue amphiboles, #he glaucophane, pumpellyite and lawsonite inclusions in albite and epidote and the omphacite-glaucophane-actinolite-epidote assemblage in the metabasites show a prograde path with increasing pressure from pumpellyite-actinolite phase field towards lawzonite-blueschists. The temperatures are range from 310 - 3300 C (Penteli area) and 330 - 3800 C (Lavrion area) and the pressures range from 0. 7 - 0. 9 (Penteli area) and 0. 8 - 0. 9 GPa (Lavrion area). Petrological data from the LTU support the high pressure/low temperature character of the studied rocks. The maximum pressures are range from 1. 2 - 1. 3 GPa and 1. 3 - 1. 4 GPa for the area of Penteli and Hymettus-Lavrion respectively. Thermobarometric evaluation of the data of the UTU show that the exhumation path is followed by continuous cooling with the maximum P-T conditions of the UTU reached a depth > 30 Km. The maximum temperatures are range from 450 - 4700 C and 460 - 4900 C for the area of Penteli and Hymettus-Lavrion respectively. The LTU rocks reached a maximum depth at about 45 - 50 Km. The exhumation path followed by temperature increase at a back-arc environment. The magmas that generate the protoliths of the metabasites from the UTU of Penteli area show enriched melts upwelling and mixing with depleted mantle melts. The magmas that generate the protoliths of the metabasites from the UTU of Lavrion area are the result of fractional crystallization. The magmas that generate the protoliths of the metabasites from the LTU of Penteli area came from the partial melting of a homogeneous source. The magmas that generate the protoliths of metamigmatites and orthogneisses show that plagioclase was the principal residual mineral phase during partial melting. The geotectonic environment of formation of the protoliths of the metamorphic rocks in Eastern Attica is generally displayed by a dual system volcanic <b>arc-back</b> arc basin. In UTU, the protoliths are settled in a N-MORB or evolved back-arc basin or to the internal part of an oceanic slab. In the LTU, the protoliths of the metabasites have been formed in an evolved tectonic environment from volcanic arc to back-arc basin. The gneissic protoliths of the LTU represent magmatic arc rocks either of pre-alpine or alpine age. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of economic gold deposits in NSW {{are associated with}} Ordovician-aged igneous rocks and are examples of the Cu-Au porphyry-skarn-epithermal association commonly developed in convergent margin to orogenic settings. They are among the oldest porphyry Cu-Au deposits in the Pacific Rim region. They are similar to younger deposits in terms of tectonic setting and structure, but the largest are chemically distinct, being associated with shoshonite magmas (Cadia, Ridgeway and Northparkes). The Lachlan Fold Belt (LFB) porphyries are subdivided into four sub-groups based mainly on their age relative to development of the Lachlan Transverse Zone (LTZ) structure. Two subgroups pre-date the LTZ, one group is syn-LTZ and one group post-dates the LTZ. No mineralisation has been found or reported among pre-I. TZ porphyries. but it is common in post-. l Z_ porphyries. Petrographic analysis and microprobe results establish {{a wide range of}} primary and secondary features within the Ordovician rocks examined in this study. Cale alkaline to shoshonitic affinities are supported by the variable abundance of primary K-feldspars. Primary mineral phases such as pyroxenes and igneous magnetite provide an indication of fractioning mineral assemblages responsible for igneous trends in magma chemistry. The hydrothermal mineral assemblages documented in these LFB study areas are characteristic of younger Cu-Au Porphyry style mineralisation. As expected, the most pervasive alteration is associated with highly mineralised shoshonitic Ordovician rocks at Ridgeway, and Cadia. the less strongly mineralised calc alkaline Ordovician rocks at Cargo. Copper Ilill and Fairholme. are correspondingly less strongly altered overall. although secondary mineral assemblages are locally abundant. Many varieties of oxides and carbonates are observed at the different study localities. Most of the studied samples conform to igneous chemical trends because they are weakly altered, although post magmatic processes, such as veining, are detectable in certain trends. The K 2 O enrichment of the studied samples is consistent with subductionmoditied mantle wedge sources. A few effects, such as the high Fe 203 contents of some Ridgeway samples, probably reflect porphyry-style hydrothermal alteration processes. Host rocks at the Cadia and Ridgeway are entirely alkalic on the K 2 O versus SiO 2 plot and shoshonitic on the Total Alkalies versus SiO 2 plot. Igneous rocks at the other deposits display a range of compositions between low K tholeiites to shoshonites that in some cases reflects multiple igneous suites. The LREE and L 1 LE enrichments, and HFSE depletions (Nb, Ta and Ti) of the magmas associated with these deposits are characteristics of a subduction-related tectonic setting. They all fall in the volcanic-arc granite and syn-collisional granite field of the Nb-Y tectonic discrimination diagram. Several magma types are identified by differences in the HFSE and REE trends. Differences in the extent and style of magma fractionation are evident in the trace element data. The Ridgeway samples define a wider range of trace element concentrations than the Cadia samples that may indicate a greater extent of fractionation during emplacement of the Ridgeway magmas. Fairholme samples display a high Nh and /If trends that are distinct from the main fields on Zr variation diagrams. Compositional differences between larger Cu-Au deposits, Cadia-Ridgeway and smaller deposits, Copper Ifill, Cargo and Fairholme are evident in terms of Nb-Ta depletion and variation. The smaller deposits show constant Nb/Ta or negative Nb/Ta trends that extend to high Nb. The larger deposits display positive Nb/Ta trends that do not extend to high Nb. This distinction reflects a difference of preferential incorporation of Nb in a mineral phase (magnetite). Comparisons between Cadia-Ridgeway and other shoshonite (altered samples of Bajo de la Alumbrera, Argentina), calc alkaline magmas from New Zealand and rocks from other areas indicate that Nb/Ta is not directly correlated with the shoshonitic classification, K 2 O vs. SiO 2, and that the Cadia-Ridgeway Nb and Ta variation is not the result of alteration. The fact that the weakly altered LFB Capertee shoshonites exhibit a narrow range of Nb and low Nb/Ta suggest the shoshonite trend for the LFB as a whole is a steep one on the Nb/Ta versus Nb plot. The results of this study could provide important information for exploration within the LFB. Only the Cadia and Ridgeway deposits display a wide range of Nb/Ta values and lack the near-horizontal trend seen for other localities associated with smaller deposits. The tectonic evolution of the LFB is a major factor contributing to occurrence of large porphyry Cu-Au deposits. The sequence of important events, however, commences with sub-crustal generation of oxidised magma and finishes with efficient Cu-Au accumulation by hydrothermal processes at favourable structural sites. The increase in Au-Cu deposit size from small (Copper Hill-Cargo) to world class (Cadia-Ridgeway) indicates the importance of magma composition during this process. The most obvious differences between the Cadia-Ridgeway and New Zealand rocks is that the latter are volcanic in origin and associated with an <b>arc-back</b> arc system. Therefore, they did not form in a tectonic regime suitable for the evolution of porphyries and the focussed movement of hydrothermal fluids during dilatant episodes. As a result, they are not linked to mineralisation despite having Nb-Ta and Nb/Ta variations that are typical of the high oxidation states in Au-prospective magmas of the LFB...|$|E
