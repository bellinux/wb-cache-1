Repeated lumbar punctures are regarded as unpleasant by patients, and they present a danger of introducing spinal infections if done too often. Repeated lumbar punctures are sometimes needed to control the ICP urgently if the patient's vision deteriorates rapidly.|$|E

25|$|Volusius Venustus {{set up a}} {{monument}} in the forum of Canosa in honour of Constantine I and his two sons (the fact that only two sons are honoured means that the monument was set up between 317 and 333, less the period between 324 and 326).

25|$|Most {{vehicles}} existing {{today have}} been serviced by GM {{during one of}} the safety recalls on the car. For the fire-related recall, shields and drip-trays were added to prevent leaking fluids from contacting hot surfaces. The presence of drip shields between the engine block and the exhaust manifold are <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>that</b> the car has been retrofitted. The addition of the longer AC Delco PF51 oil filter and a re-calibrated dipstick added extra oil capacity to the oiling system, and enabled running four quarts of oil in the crankcase instead of three, to help prevent oil starvation to the rods. Certain vehicles also had their connecting rods or entire block replaced.|$|E
25|$|Unaware {{that the}} Crown Prince {{did not have}} much to do with the running of Army Group Crown Prince or the 5th Army, the Deuxième Bureau offered Zelle one million francs if she could seduce him and provide France with good {{intelligence}} about German plans. The fact that the Crown Prince had, before 1914, never commanded a unit larger than a regiment, and was now supposedly commanding both an army and an army group at the same time should have been <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>that</b> his role in German decision-making was mostly nominal. Zelle's contact with the Deuxième Bureau was Captain Georges Ladoux, who was later to emerge as one of her principal accusers.|$|E

It also hints that the novel would have a happy ending for the couples, as in The Merchant of Venice. Originally it was the novel Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë that Alice tore a page from, but Jane Eyre had nothing to do with the story, so Meyer changed it.|$|E

25|$|No other {{candidates}} were proposed and the Returning Officer called for Dyer {{to give a}} speech to the electors regarding what he would advocate for and his goals if he became the Member of Parliament for Bruce. However, before Dyer made his speech John Hardy stepped in and asked if he could say some words as Henry Clapcott's representative, an action opposed by other electors. Hardy said that in reply to some observations by J. L. Gillies regarding the state of the province of Otago without a treasurer— he would then also like to nominate Marryatt—who was himself an elector for the by-election. The observations were concerning the fact that Clapcott would be forced to resign as Treasurer to take up his role as MP for Bruce. Marryatt had opposed the stepping in of Hardy, without <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>that</b> he would be nominated for the role. Laughingly, J. L. Gillies seconded that nomination. However, Gillies said that an elector may only nominate one person for a role at an election. The Returning Officer then justified that an elector may nominate as many people as they like. Returning the compliment, Marryatt nominated Hardy for the role, seconded by George E. Brown. However, the Returning Officer took no notice of the nominations, stating that it was immature of the electors to make a joke on such a serious duty. Multiple electors then said that some fun at an election was expected, a stance which the Returning Officer disagreed with.|$|E

500|$|According to Manolescu, Mateiu Caragiale took direct {{inspiration}} from foreign works of detective fiction when outlining his story, but also mocked their conventions by having Ruse rely on literature and even cartomancy for his crime solving techniques. Vartic drew a parallel between Caragiale's style {{and that of}} two 20th century foreign authors of crime fiction—Dashiell Hammett and Giorgio Bassani. The general intent, Manolescu notes, is not in realistically depicting police procedures, but in showing [...] "the human mystery." [...] Thus, Ion Vartic argues, Gogu Nicolau may be Caragiale's attempt to see himself from the outside, and his disappearance may be <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>that</b> the writer was planning to sever links with the cultural milieu. The work's title and its generic meaning are found in Ruse's final statement: [...] "There are such things meant to always remain—since forever—under the seal of secrecy." ...|$|E
500|$|Breeds {{received}} a Logie Award nomination for [...] "Most Popular New Female Talent" [...] at the 51st Logie Awards for her portrayal of Ruby. She was later {{nominated for the}} [...] "Most Popular Actress" [...] Logie in 2010, with Breeds stating: [...] "To know that people like Ruby makes me think I'm doing a good job." [...] At the 2012 Inside Soap Awards, Breeds was nominated for [...] "Best Daytime Star". Holy Soap recall Ruby's most memorable moment as being: [...] "Trying to cope with her Dad's illness, Ruby started talking to someone on Skype, {{only to find out}} it was Matthew playing a trick. She got revenge by convincing him to go skinny-dipping and nicking his clothes." [...] Carolyn Stewart writing for TV Week felt it was unrealistic for Ruby and Nicole to be best friends after she has [...] "actively pursued two of Nicole's ex-boyfriends." [...] She criticised Bianca's role in Ruby and Liam's storyline, quipping [...] "Bianca-The-Butt-In-Ski" [...] offered [...] "her two cents worth" [...] – subsequently calling her efforts unhelpful to Ruby. She also discussed Ruby's sudden descent into drink and wearing make up; [...] "Obviously heavy make-up is <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>that</b> a character is about to go off the rails… and, boy did she!" [...] She said the moral of the storyline was to never {{fall in love with a}} teacher and that the situation had resulted in her as the [...] "drowned-rat Ruby with eye-liner pouring down her face". Stewart later said [...] "The way Ruby stares at Liam... oh, I'm just so embarrassed for the poor little petal! Hilarious!" [...] She also criticised Nicole's bad advice. She later praised the storyline stating it was getting [...] "juicy". Catrin Griffiths writing for the Daily Express said the serial came back in style after its summer break in the UK, owing to storylines such as Ruby's binge drinking.|$|E

2500|$|It Boalserter Nut ("The Bolsward Utility" [...] – {{the name}} of a gentlemen's club), which was {{published}} in De Lapekoer, was Halbertsma's first short story of a more extended length. As is often the case with Halbertsma's stories, it consists of a frame-story in which several other more or less stand-alone components are absorbed, such as the essay It Jild ("The Money"). Miswier ("Continuously Bad Weather") and De Twadde Jûn ("The Second Evening") are also extensive frame-stories, and De Skearwinkel fan Joutebaas ("Boss Joute's Barbershop") is a dialogue, which includes the intriguing and completely stand-alone story Heksershol ("Hole of Witchcraft"– an old nickname for the village of Molkwerum). The only time Halbertsma wrote a literary work entirely without the participation of Eeltsje, was in 1837, when he published Oan Eölus ("To Aeolus"), a story inspired by a great storm in 1830, in which a tornado has blown thoughts and motifs together like whirling leaves. Oan Eölus could perhaps be seen as <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>that</b> Halbertsma harboured greater literary aspirations than would fit in the De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar.|$|E

2500|$|In Catholic circles, Ghenadie's {{dismissal}} {{was reported}} as <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>that</b> the Orthodox Church was in crisis. Das Vaterland journal, published in neighboring Austria-Hungary by the Christian Social movement, announced: [...] "all this quarrel between bishop and synod, {{and the entire}} situation of the Romanian church, is a new supporting argument for old experienced fact, namely that the Eastern Church, as broken away from Rome, shall never flourish, but will advance resolutely toward internal and external decomposition." [...] Ghenadie's guilt was under constant reassessment by the Synod, reflecting political competitions outside the Romanian Orthodox Church. According to Miron Cristea, the institution shamed itself further by yielding to outside pressures, particularly since the Synod appeared unconvinced about the truth of its own convictions: [...] "Only {{in a state of}} decay can one proceed in this manner." [...] Similarly, Brusanowski argues: [...] "the Synod [...] to render two mutually exclusive verdicts.

[...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave a negative review of the film, rating it one and half stars out of four. He criticized the film for being {{so close to the}} 1984 original [...] "sometimes song for song and word-for-word". He thought poorly of Wormald's performance, saying, [...] "He's got the Kevin Bacon role but not the Kevin Bacon charisma." [...] Ebert closed his review expressing, [...] "This new Footloose is a film without wit, humor or purpose. It sets up the town elders as old farts who hate rock 'n' roll. Does it have <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>that</b> the Rev. Moore and all the other city council members are young enough that they grew up on rock 'n' roll?
