5|$|The Doctor and Clara find a {{location}} in the mansion which is noticeably colder {{than the rest of}} the house, and they feel as if they are being watched. Suddenly the house grows cold and Clara feels something holding her hand when there's nothing there. The two race back to where the Professor and Emma <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Palmer's equipment activating of its own accord. A thin black disc materializes in front of them and Emma senses something crying out for help as the ghost appears in a dark hallway crying for help. The Doctor quickly takes pictures of them before the disc vanishes and the house returns to normal.|$|E
6000|$|She turned shining eyes to him, {{her voice}} was clear and strong. [...] "In the city, in the earth, a myriad myriad men and women <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what you will do, full of strange {{incredible}} expectations." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was beautifully put. There was but {{one thing}} to be done--I kissed him. And there was {{but one thing}} to be said. I asked at what time we might expect to receive Miss Jillgall. [...] "She is staying, Helena, at a small hotel in the town. I have already sent to say that we <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her. Perhaps you will look at the spare bedroom?" ...|$|E
60|$|Jack Bruce <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the {{headmaster}} {{in his study}} {{at the end of}} afternoon school.|$|R
60|$|My dear Paradine, I've <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you for {{the last}} two hours. How {{tiresome}} you are.|$|R
60|$|Their paths diverged; {{and when}} Somerset reached the hotel he was {{informed}} that somebody <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him.|$|R
6000|$|WISE MAN. You {{have heard}} everything! That {{is why you}} want to find out what hour it is! You <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them coming through the door to carry me away. [FOOL goes on blowing.] Out through the door with you! I will have no one here when they come. [He seizes the FOOL by the shoulders, and begins to force him out through the door, then {{suddenly}} changes his mind.] No, I have something to ask you. [He drags him back into the room.] Is there a heaven? Is there a hell? Is there a purgatory? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was hopeful before, Major, and I am hopeful now; but I can't {{say that}} today's parade has {{influenced}} {{me in the}} slightest. Whatever virtues the Hindoo may have, he has certainly that of knowing how to wait. I believe, from what took place, {{that they have no}} intention of breaking out at present; whether they <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what is done at other stations, or until they receive a signal, is more than I can say; but their assurances do not weigh with me to the slightest extent. Their history is full of cases of perfidious massacre. I should say, 'Trust them as long as you can, but don't relax your watch.'" ...|$|E
60|$|COLONEL VON WOLFERSDORF WITHDRAWS, ALSO BEAUTIFULLY (August 15th). Accordingly, Wednesday, August 15th, {{at eight}} in the morning, Wolfersdorf by the Elbe Gate moves out; across Elbe Bridge, and the Redoubt {{which is on the}} farther shore yonder. Near this Redoubt, Stolberg and many of his General Officers <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him go. He goes in state; flags flying, music playing. Battalion Hessen-Cassel, {{followed}} by all our Packages, Hospital convalescents, King's Artillery, and whatever is the King's or ours, marches first. Next comes, as rear-guard to all this, Battalion Grollmann;--along with which is Wolfersdorf himself, knowing Grollmann for a ticklish article (Saxons mainly); followed on the heel by Battalion Hofmann, and lastly by Battalion Salmuth, trusty Prussians both of these.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have you <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{the moon}} rise?" [...] asked Sir John, glancing at Christopher from beneath his shaggy eyebrows as he returned.|$|R
60|$|I {{admitted}} {{to her that}} I <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Mr Fyne come out. That was all. I {{had nothing to say}} to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is a lady here, sir," [...] he said--"she arrived some hours ago--who has <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you. You {{will find}} {{her in the}} morning-room." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have done}} all this, Allan Quatermain," [...] he said. [...] "When renouncing civilization, I wandered here by chance; seeking {{a home in the}} remotest places of the world, I found this lonely spot a wilderness. Nothing was to be seen except the site, the domes of the marble huts, and the waterfalls. I took {{possession}} of the huts. I cleared the path of garden land and planted the orange grove. I had only six natives then, but by degrees others joined me, now my tribe is a thousand strong. Here we live in profound peace and plenty. I have all I need, and I seek no more. Heaven has prospered me so far--may it do so to the end, which for me draws nigh. And now I am tired and will go back. If you wish to see the old quarry and the mouth of the ancient mines, Stella will show them to you. No, my love, you need not trouble to come, I can manage. Look! some of the headmen <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> me." ...|$|E
6000|$|That {{was a sort}} of Chinese Madame Tussaud's--life-like {{models of}} men being brayed in mortars, sliced, fried, toasted, stuffed, and {{variously}} bedevilled--that made me sick and unhappy. But the Chinese are merciful even in their tortures. When a man is ground in a mill, he is, according to the models, popped in head first. This is hard on the crowd who <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the fun, but it saves trouble to the executioners. A half-ground man has to be carefully watched, or else he wriggles out of his place. To crown all, we went to the prison, which was a pest-house in a back street. The Professor shuddered. [...] "It's all right," [...] I said. [...] "The people who sent the prisoners here don't care. The men themselves look hideously miserable, but I suppose they don't care, and goodness knows I don't care. They are only Chinamen. If they treat each other like dogs, why should we regard 'em as human beings? Let 'em rot. I {{want to get back to}} the steamer. I want to get under the guns of Hong-Kong. Phew!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Mr. Bly, I owe you {{an apology}} for coming here, and some thanks for the only sleep I've had in forty-eight hours. I struck this old shebang at about ten o'clock, and it's now two, so I reckon I've put in about four hours' square sleep. Now, look here." [...] He beckoned Herbert towards the window. [...] "Do you see those three men {{standing}} under that gaslight? Well, they're part of a gang of Vigilantes who've hunted me to the hill, and <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> me {{come out of the}} bushes, where they reckon I'm hiding. Go to them and say that I'm here! Tell them you've got Gentleman George--George Dornton, the man they've been hunting for a week--in this room. I promise you I won't stir, nor kick up a row, when they've come. Do it, and Carstone, if he's a square man, will raise your salary for it, and promote you." [...] He yawned slightly, and then slowly looking around him, drew the easy-chair towards him and dropped comfortably in it, gazing at the astounded and motionless Herbert with a lazy smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is a young}} lady, your Grace," [...] he announced, [...] "who has <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you {{for half}} an hour. Her name is Miss Phillimore." ...|$|R
6000|$|She might quite have <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what {{he would}} come to, but she spoke with a certain impatience. [...] "What on earth are you talking about?" ...|$|R
60|$|Returning to the villa, I was {{informed}} that another visitor <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> me: a civilized visitor this time, who had given her name. My mother-in-law--Mrs. Macallan.|$|R
6000|$|... "Go and borrow {{some from}} the next ward, and {{spend the rest of}} the day in finding ours," [...] I finally command. A pause; then Frank scuffles back with the message: [...] "Miss Peppercorn ain't got none, and says you ain't no {{business}} to lose your own duds and go borrowin' other folkses." [...] I say nothing, for fear of saying too much, but fly to the surgery. Mr. Toddypestle informs me that I can't have anything without an order from the surgeon of my ward. Great heavens! where is he? and away I rush, up and down, here and there, till at last I find him, in a state of bliss over a complicated amputation, in the fourth story. I make my demand; he answers: [...] "In five minutes," [...] and works away, with his head upside down, as he ties an artery, saws a bone, or does a little needle-work, with a visible relish and very sanguinary pair of hands. The five minutes grow to fifteen, and Frank appears, with the remark that, [...] "Dammer wants to know what in thunder you are keeping him there with his finger on a wet rag for?" [...] Dr. P. tears himself away long enough to scribble the order, with which I plunge downward to the surgery again, find the door locked, and, while hammering away on it, am told that two friends <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> me in the hall. The matron being away, her parlor is locked, and there is nowhere to see my guests but in my own room, and no time to enjoy them till the plaster is found. I settle this matter, and circulate through the house to find Toddypestle, who has no right, to leave the surgery till night. He is discovered in the dead house, smoking a cigar; and very much the worse for his researches among the spirituous preparations that fill the surgery shelves. He is inclined to be gallant, and puts the finishing blow to the fire of my wrath; for the tea-kettle lid flies off, and driving him before me to his post, I fling down the order, take what I choose; and, leaving the absurd incapable kissing his hand to me, depart, feeling, as Grandma Riglesty is reported to have done, when she vainly sought for chips, in Bimleck Jackwood's [...] "shifless paster." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The king <b>is</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you, white lords," [...] {{he said in}} a {{voice of}} very forced jollity, [...] "and I have come to conduct you to him." ...|$|R
60|$|Charley was poking {{over the}} Kennett and Avon lock entries, {{with his usual}} {{official}} energy, when the office messenger came up and informed him that a lady <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him.|$|R
60|$|All {{the streets}} were spread with carpets, and the windows were full of ladies who <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the Princess, and carried baskets of flowers and sweetmeats to shower upon her as she passed.|$|R
5000|$|During Israel's {{air strikes}} against the Gaza Strip in December 2008, Mazini warned Israel about sending in ground forces, stating [...] "the people of Gaza <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the Zionist enemy in Gaza to tear them into pieces of flesh." ...|$|E
50|$|It is {{not clear}} why Samsung took a {{unilateral}} decision to terminate the Samsung Link service, and users are assuming {{that it was a}} cost-saving measure in the aftermath of Samsung's losses from the Galaxy Note 7 recall. Anecdotal evidence suggests that customers who say they bought their devices specifically for the Samsung Link functionality are unhappy with this decision, but <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> whether Samsung re-instates the AllShare functionality which does not require Samsung to provide an ongoing internet-based service.|$|E
5000|$|Raj Kumar Shukla {{has been}} {{described}} by Gandhi in his Atmakatha, as a man whose suffering gave him the strength to rise against the odds. In his letter to Gandhi he wrote [...] "Respected Mahatma, You hear the stories of others everyday. Today please listen to my story.... I want to draw your attention to the promise made by you in the Lucknow Congress that you would come to Champaran. The time has come for you to fulfill your promise. 1.9 million suffering people of Champaran <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you." ...|$|E
60|$|I sprang out of bed. The very man I wanted <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> me! Major Fitz-David, as {{the phrase}} is, knew everybody. Intimate with my husband, he would {{certainly}} know my husband's old friend--Miserrimus Dexter.|$|R
50|$|In December 2016, David Grisham accosted a {{group of}} {{children}} and their parents who <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Santa Claus at Westgate Mall. A recording he made of the incident shows him being confronted by several parents.|$|R
50|$|The second time, as B-1505 <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Col. Ojdanić at the Višegrad Hotel, {{he saw the}} Bosnian Serb Vice-President Biljana Plavšić {{arrive with}} Branimir Savović (wearing a {{military}} camouflageuniform) for talks with the JNA officers.|$|R

50|$|Like all Pan American boxing events, the {{competition}} is a straight single-elimination tournament. Both semifinal losers are awarded bronze medals, so no boxers compete again after their first loss. Bouts consist of a 3 rounds “10-point must” scoring system used in the pro game, where the winner of each round must be awarded 10 points and the loser a lesser amount. AIBA officials <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how things go in the men’s game before making a decision to take head gear off women fighters. Five judges scored each bout.
