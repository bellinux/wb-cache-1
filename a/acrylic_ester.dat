An <b>acrylic</b> <b>ester</b> by itself can undergo chain-growth polymerization to form a homopolymer with a carbon-carbon backbone, such as poly(methyl methacrylate). Also, however, certain acrylic esters can react with diamine monomers by nucleophilic conjugate addition of amine groups to acrylic C=C bonds. In this case the polymerization proceeds by step-growth and the products are poly(beta-amino ester) copolymers, with backbones containing nitrogen (as amine) and oxygen (as ester) as well as carbon.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to assess the}} capability of organic hydrophobic polymeric resins Amberlite XAD- 4 and XAD- 7 to remove the pesticides alachlor and amitrole from water. The pesticides adsorption on the two different adsorbents was measured by batch equilibrium technique and isotherm types and parameters were estimated. Two theoretical models were applied based on a Freundlich and a Langmuir isotherms. The effect of pesticides chemical composition and structure as well as the nature of solid surface on the efficiency of adsorption was evaluated. The influence of pH also was studied. In low pH solutions adsorption of amitrole was higher upon the nonionic aliphatic <b>acrylic</b> <b>ester</b> copolymer XAD- 7 in comparison to the nonionic, crosslinked macroreticular copolymer of styrene divinylbenzene XAD- 4. In neutral and intermediate pH solutions the polar <b>acrylic</b> <b>ester</b> copolymer XAD- 7 was more effective to the retention of alachlor. The <b>acrylic</b> <b>ester</b> copolymer showed at pH 3 the lower effectiveness in alachlor removal from water.
