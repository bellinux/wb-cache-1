5000|$|An El Rollo (Spanish for [...] "The Roll") is a bodyboarding trick {{performed}} {{when the}} bodyboarder hits {{the lip of}} the wave and uses its power to throw himself out with the lip in a perfect arc to complete a roll before landing on the wave surface or into the white water. When the bodyboarder detaches completely from the wave surface or the lip the trick is called an <b>air</b> <b>roll</b> or aerial roll. Other variations include the [...] "barrel roll" [...] where the roll is completed inside the barrel, and the [...] "rollo takeoff" [...] which is performed while catching the wave. This trick was named by someone in the industry. I remember the story where Pat Caldwell did the roll and Jack Lindholm or whoever saw him do it and commented [...] "what do you call that an el rollo". Photos of the new move and captions started appearing in Bodyboarding Magazine. The move and the term caught on and spread around the world.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} is {{a summary of the}} conditions that cause the Morning Glory cloud to form in the Gulf of Carpentaria (after hypothesis of R.H.Clarke, as described in 1981). First, Cape York which is the peninsula that lies to the east of the gulf, is large enough that sea breezes develop on both sides. During the day, the breeze from the Coral Sea coast blows in from the east and the breeze from the gulf blows in from the west. The two breezes meet {{in the middle of the}} peninsula, forcing the air to rise there and form a line of clouds over the spine of the peninsula. When night comes, the air cools and descends and at the same time a surface inversion (where air temperature increases with height) forms over the gulf. The densities in this stable layer are different above and below the inversion. The air descending from the peninsula to the east goes underneath the inversion layer and this generates a series of waves or rolling cylinders which travel across the gulf. These cylinders of <b>air</b> <b>roll</b> along the underside of the inversion layer, so that the air rises at the front of the wave and sinks at the rear. In the early morning, the air is saturated enough so that the rising air in the front produces a cloud, which forms the leading edge of the cylinder, and evaporates in the back, hence forming the Morning Glory cloud. The cloud lasts until the surface inversion disappears with the heating of the day.|$|E

50|$|An ARS, {{which stands}} for <b>Air</b> - <b>Roll</b> - Spin, is a bodyboarding trick that {{combines}} an El Rollo with a 360° spin while the bodyboarder is in the air.

The move was revolutionary and ushered in whole new gymnastic approach to riding a bodyboard. Kelly Slater credits the Rodeo Clown move was adapted from the ARS.|$|R
5000|$|Convergent {{evolution}} occurs {{often in}} 3DVCE, as similar structures {{and behaviors of}} the creatures form to maximize fitness. Two-Armed Jumpers consist of a small core and two large symmetrical [...] "wings", and evolve in response to jumping and distance requirement. These creatures propel themselves forward using their limbs by jiggling or flapping them. Jumping Ribbons and Springs consist of a chain of segments and evolve in response to max height and distance. They contract or curl up and stretch out their body to leap into the <b>air.</b> <b>Rolling</b> Ribbons and Springs {{are very similar to}} the previous group, except they are often larger and segments are more repetitive. They evolve in response to average height, distance, and TOG (touching the ground). They roll on the ground to propel their head into the air to attain height while still touching the ground. Some simply roll in a horizontal fashion like a cylinder. Single-Joint Powered Creatures have more erratic structures and evolve in response to distance on bumpy terrain. They have one large segment in back which kicks the creature forward, but being poorly balanced they use the rest of their bodies to get back up after stumbling or prevent stumbles altogether.|$|R
