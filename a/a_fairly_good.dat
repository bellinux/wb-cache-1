Hexagonal graphitic carbon (graphite) is the most thermodynamically stable allotrope of carbon under ambient conditions. It has a lustrous appearance and is <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> <b>good</b> electrical conductor. Graphite has a layered structure. Each layer comprises carbon atoms bonded to three other carbon atoms in a honeycomb lattice arrangement. The layers are stacked together and held loosely by van der Waals forces and delocalized valence electrons.|$|E

However, the step from supercell, or other respective formative processes, to tornadogenesis and the prediction of tornadic vs. non-tornadic mesocyclones is not yet well known and is the focus of much research.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{resignation}} of Strachan {{at the end of}} the 2008–09 season, Brown's former Hibs boss Tony Mowbray became Celtic manager. Brown underwent surgery during pre-season in an attempt to rectify his ankle problem, but this didn't work, and he played matches despite not being fully fit. Celtic had <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> <b>good</b> start to their league campaign, going into the first Old Firm match four points ahead of Rangers, but they lost 2–1. Celtic beat Dynamo Moscow in Champions League qualifying, but then lost the play-off to Arsenal, which meant that they dropped into the Europa League group stage. The 1–0 home defeat by Hamburg on 22 October 2009 was Brown's last action of the year, as Celtic initially chose to rest him in another effort to heal the ankle injury. This proved unsuccessful, and he underwent a second operation in Rotterdam to try and clear up his ankle injury.|$|E

5|$|The {{pinniped}} ear {{is adapted}} for hearing underwater, {{where it can}} hear sound frequencies at up to 70,000Hz. In air, hearing is somewhat reduced in pinnipeds compared to many terrestrial mammals. While {{they are capable of}} hearing a wide range of frequencies (e.g. 500 to 32,000Hz in the northern fur seal, compared to 20 to 20,000Hz in humans), their airborne hearing sensitivity is weaker overall. One study of three species—the harbor seal, California sea lion and northern elephant seal—found that the sea lion was best adapted for airborne hearing, the harbor seal was equally capable of hearing in air and water, and the elephant seal was better adapted for underwater hearing. Although pinnipeds have <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> <b>good</b> sense of smell on land, it is useless underwater as their nostrils are closed.|$|E

Peel Holdings commissioned market research consultants MORI to undertake a telephone poll over seventeen days in 2002, soliciting the opinions of residents in Bury, Rossendale and Rochdale about wind farms in general and Scout Moor in particular.

40|$|Many {{oligopoly}} theories {{predict a}} positive correlation between market size and the equilibrium number of firms and some also imply that competition is more intense in larger markets. The authors test these predictions on a sample of driving schools in 250 Swedish regional markets by estimating the relation between the number of firms, production capacity, and market size. The number of firms increases less than proportionally with market size. Market size per capacity unit is smaller in large markets. Since firms produce <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> homogenous <b>good,</b> the authors argue that this is evidence that profits per capita is decreasing in market size.

25|$|Imperial Mali is {{best known}} through three primary sources: {{the first is the}} account of Shihab al-'Umari, written in about 1340 by a geographer-administrator in Mamluk Egypt.

He had first-hand information from several sources, and from a second-hand source, he learned of the visit of Mansa Musa. The second account is that of the traveller Ibn Battuta, who visited Mali in 1352. This is the first account of a West African kingdom made directly by an eyewitness; the others are usually second-hand.

It {{fought in the}} Battle of the Frontiers, seeing action in Lorraine and against the French defensive line from Nancy to Epinal. At the end of September 1914, the division was transferred from Lorraine to Belgium, where it participated in the Siege of Antwerp. After Antwerp fell, the division occupied the city and participated in follow-on fighting in Belgian Flanders. It fought in the Battle of the Yser and then went into the line on the Yser until November 1916. During this period, the division fought in the Second Battle of Ypres in April/May 1915 and in the Battle of the Somme in October 1916. It was in the trenchlines in the Somme region from December 1916 to February 1917. After fighting before the German Siegfried position, the division participated in the Battle of Arras.

The present paper provides a theoretical examination {{of this type of}} market by developing a sequential search model with incomplete information where consumers are uninformed about the underlying production cost. We characterize a perfect Bayesian equilibrium in which consumers follow reservation price strategies and provide a sufficient condition for such an equilibrium to exist. Firms strategically exploit consumers being uninformed about their production cost, and set on average higher prices compared to the standard complete information model. The importance of asymmetric information vanishes, however, when the number of firms becomes very large. Further, we find that expected prices and consumer welfare might be non–monotonic in the number of firms. JEL Classification: D 40; D 83; L 1...|$|R
