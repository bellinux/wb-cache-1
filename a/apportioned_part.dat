50|$|Where a lessee is evicted from, or surrenders or forfeits {{possession}} {{of part of}} the property leased to him, he becomes liable at common law to pay only a rent apportioned {{to the value of}} the interest which he still retains. So where the person entitled to the reversion of an estate assigns part of it, the right to an <b>apportioned</b> <b>part</b> of the rent incident to the England, and in many of the British colonies.

50|$|At common law, {{there was}} no {{apportionment}} of rent in respect of time. Such apportionment was, however, in certain cases allowed in England by the Distress for Rent Act 1737, and the Apportionment Act 1834, and is now allowed generally. Under that statute (§2) all rents, annuities, dividends and other periodical payments {{in the nature of}} income are to be considered as accruing from day to day and to be apportionable in respect of time accordingly. It is provided, however, that the <b>apportioned</b> <b>part</b> of such rents, etc., shall only be payable or recoverable {{in the case of a}} continuing payment, when the entire portion of which it forms part itself becomes payable, and, in the case of a payment determined by re-entry, death or otherwise, only when the next entire portion would have been payable if it had not so determined (§ 3). Persons entitled to apportioned parts of rent have the same remedies for recovering them when payable as they would have had in respect of the entire rent; but a lessee is not to be liable for any <b>apportioned</b> <b>part</b> specifically. The rent is recoverable by the heir or other person who would, but for the apportionment, be entitled to the entire rent, and he holds it subject to distribution (§ 4). The Apportionment Act 1870 extends to payments not made under any instrument in writing (§2), but not to annual sums made payable in policies of insurance (§ 6). Apportionment under the act can be excluded by express stipulation.|$|E

40|$|A {{field effect}} {{transistor}} channel charge partitioning scheme is proposed that explains small-signal port parameters associated with the source and drain terminals. The scheme starts with the channel charge, that can be readily extracted from measurement, and defines source charge as that for a drainless channel. The drain charge is the difference required for neutrality. This new approach is a contrast to alternative schemes that <b>apportion</b> <b>part</b> of the channel charge to the source. A significant outcome is the insight that the drain and source charges are larger in magnitude than the channel charge. This is an essential requirement for the correct modelling of reactive parameters not associated with the gate, such as drain-source capacitance, transcapacitance, or transconductance delay. 4 page(s...|$|R
50|$|With {{regard to}} the former of these classes, it may be noticed that {{although}} apportioned rent becomes payable only when the whole rent is due, the landlord, {{in the case of}} the bankruptcy of an ordinary tenant, may prove for a proportionate part of the rent up to the date of the receiving order; and that a similar rule holds good in the winding up of a company; and further that the act of 1870 applies to the liability to pay, as well as to the right to receive, rent. Accordingly, where an assignment of a lease is made between two half-yearly rent-days, the assignee is not liable to pay the full amount of the half-year's rent falling due on the rent-day next after the date of the assignment, but only an <b>apportioned</b> <b>part</b> of that half-year's rent, computed from the last mentioned date. If you pay a ground rent on a leasehold property or a rentcharge on a freehold property that is also payable on other neighbouring properties, you can apply to the Department for Communities and Local Government for an ‘order of apportionment’ that legally separates your share of the ground rent or rentcharge.|$|E
40|$|The {{recognition}} of the international scope {{and nature of the}} problem of refugees, which induced the establishment of UNHCR and the adoption of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, did not result in shared responsibility for the protection of refugees but rather in a strict apportioning of responsibilities between UNHCR on the one hand, and states on the other. Rather than sharing the <b>apportioned</b> <b>part</b> as a collective responsibility, states become individually responsible for refugees who seek refuge in their respective territories, and hence only for part of the problem of refugees. This individual responsibility is triggered by observing the prohibition of refoulement. Since this prohibition is not coupled to a distributive mechanism, its observance may cause huge disparities in terms of numbers of refugees, and hence in the extent of responsibility individual states incur. Remedying these indiscriminate effects would require taking collective responsibility for the problem of refugees, more in particular, a system that would secure joint and several responsibility whereby individual states have the right of recourse to other states to recover ‘overpayment’, in short: a non-discretionary burden sharing mechanism that involves all states...|$|E
40|$|The Polish {{cooperative}} law of 1982 introduces new institutions, among others it is a partition of the already existing cooperative. It {{can be performed}} in that manner that a new cooperative is created from the <b>apportioned</b> <b>part</b> of the existing one while the latter is acting from then on in a curtailed structure. Any cooperative can be divided unless it is in liquidation or in bankruptcy. The cooperative is divided subject {{to the will of}} at least two thirds of its members. Consequently the grounds for division are formed by the decision of the general meeting of the cooperative members taken by the majority of two thirds of votes. In course of the partition the new cooperative is being established. Its activity is regulated by the general rules of {{cooperative law}}. It is the new particular mode of forming a cooperative. Its main characteristic trait {{lies in the fact that}} the cooperative is constituted by members of other cooperative and such will can also be manifested by persons who are not becoming members of the cooperative being established in course of the division of existing one. The decision of general meeting made in case of the cooperatives partition must include: a) denomination of the cooperative being partitioned and the cooperative being formed in course of the partition, b) the list of members leaving the partitioned cooperative for the newly created one, c) approval of the balance- -sheet of the partitioned cooperative and a draft of distribution of property elements and d) a date of the cooperative's division. Provisions of the statute of cooperative formed in course of the partition cannot curtail the property rights of its members. The decision of the general meeting concerning the partition can be appealed against according to the general rules known in the cooperative law. A right to lay an action against such decision is granted to members of that cooperative and to managing board of the competent central union. Decisions of the meeting of members moving from the partitioned cooperative to the one formed in course of the partition can also be appealed against in court. A date of cooperative partition in a legal meaning is the date of entering that event in the register. If the records of partition and of establishing new cooperatives were entered by two courts at different time, then the date of registering the forming of new cooperative is decisive in the aspect the cooperatives partition. In the effect of the partition part of members of the previously existing cooperative moves to the newly created one. The property elements indicated in the „draft of distribution" are also moved for the new cooperative, they include mobilities and immobilities, technical equipement and means of production. By virtue of the law the new cooperative takes over the duties and rights of the previous one, mentioned in the „draft of distribution". It is a case of the cumamilative transfers of debts. Two cooperatives are joint and several liable for these debts. The cooperative created in course of the division takes over the employees as well. It enters into the legal relations effected by the labor contracts concluded between those employees and the cooperative which was partitioned.

40|$|The {{development}} of complex systems involves a multi-tier supply chain, with each organisation allocated a reliability target for their sub-system or component <b>part</b> <b>apportioned</b> from system requirements. Agreements about targets are made {{early in the}} system lifecycle when considerable uncertainty exists about the design detail and potential failure modes. Hence resources required to achieve reliability are unpredictable. Some types of contracts provide incentives for organisations to negotiate targets so that system reliability requirements are met, but at minimum cost to the supply chain. This paper proposes a mechanism for deriving a fair price for trading reliability targets between suppliers using information gained about potential failure modes through development {{and the costs of}} activities required to generate such information. The approach is based upon Shapley's value and is illustrated through examples for a particular reliability growth model, and associated empirical cost model, developed for problems motivated by the aerospace industry.

40|$|Research PaperThis paper {{outlines}} {{the process and}} impact of a phased introduction of cost recovery on the Victorian wild and aquaculture sectors and the framework for tracking and delivering data outputs to a co-management fisheries management structure. In order to determine whether efficient and effective {{development and use of}} fisheries resources is occurring, all costs associated with these activities must be identified and appropriately <b>apportioned.</b> An integral <b>part</b> of these costs include Fisheries Management Services (FMS) usually delivered by publicly funded Fisheries Management Agencies (FMA’s). FMS refers to a range of services provided by a FMA that supports the management of public (wild resources) and private (aquaculture) fisheries resources. FMS are best assessed on an activity basis (activity based costing) with the apportionment of costs associated with these services based upon estimated costs and benefits to particular beneficiary groups. Fisheries Victoria has developed a computerised logging and data management system. The community’s interest (including intergenerational concerns) must be met by state stewardship. Being a public good, the FMS costs associated with this responsibility should be fully funded from the tax base. On the other hand, costs associated with FMS that directly benefit private entities for private gain are being recovered by FMA’s around the world to varying degrees of sophistication and degree. The recovery of these costs are usually in the form of levies or fees on licence holders. The economic costs associated with the increases in fisheries management levies are {{in the form of a}} short-term increase in enterprise costs and decreased returns. Concurrent with these impacts is the restructuring of fishing sectors as industry adjustment processes takes place...|$|R
40|$|One major {{trajectory}} of early 'aql traditions is scrutinized: the Aqbil! Adbir! creation narrative "lamma khalaqa llahu l-'aqla (When god {{had created the}} intelligence [...] .) ". In Part I early Sunni and Shii transmission and reception of the varying texts dominates the discussion, with analysis of chief motifs. Then successive transformations are traced, with attention devoted to ideas of 'first creation'. The original context of the Aqbil! reports is convincingly explained within the thought forms of 1 st & 2 nd century theological ideas of voluntarism or predestination, without recourse to Goldziher's "new-Platonic element". The late neo-Platonising form "awwalu ma khalaqa llahu l-'aqlu, (The first (thing) God created is the intellect [...] .) ", is shown to be not earlier than the mid- 3 rd/ 9 th century. In a related class of narratives, 'aql pre-exists {{in the realm of}} the divine Throne. The focus is the notion of the divinely provisioned innate trait of 'intelligence' or 'wisdom' as a "light in the heart" inequitably <b>apportioned</b> among humanity. <b>Part</b> II examines the creative manner in which the sixth Shi'iimam Ja'far al-Sadiq (d. 148 / 765) transforms the Aqbil! tradition by integrating this heavenly sapiential 'aql with the 'Adam-Iblis' conflict into a binary listing of the character traits (akhlaq, khisal). His myth of the creation, empowerment, and opposition between 'aql and jahl (intelligence & ignorance, or wisdom & folly) propounds a psycho-ethical scheme for the inner purgative struggle, wherein 'aql operates as chief of the character traits, Ja'far stresses the cognitive function (ma'rifah) in the perfection of 'aql peculiar to the inner circles of humanity (prophets, saints$ $ Imams, the faithful). An assessment is given of the repercussions of al-Sadiq's contribution for continuing Shii and Sufi enrichments of the 'aql creation narratives (eg. with al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi) ...|$|R
40|$|The English verbs cut and break, {{and their}} {{counterparts}} in other languages, often figure in discussions of verb semantics, constructional meaning, {{and the relationship between}} the two. Ironically, the core meanings of these verbs are rarely addressed: the critical portion of the meaning is typically rendered as a constant (“in need of further exploration”), as in break: ‘x cause [y become BROKEN]’. So {{what does it mean to}} ‘cut’ or ‘break’ something? And how are elements of meaning distributed across the predicate in different languages (e. g., simple verb, verb-particle or verb-verb constructions) ? This study investigates how languages partition the semantic domain of ‘cutting and breaking’, and how children learn the system of their target language. In the first phase of the research, descriptions of a set of videotaped ‘cutting and breaking’ events were elicited from adult speakers of 28 diverse languages. Multivariate statistics show that there is considerable agreement on the ‘semantic space’ underlying this domain – e. g., all the languages recognize a dimension to do with the agent’s degree of control over the point of separation in the patient’s material integrity. But there is variation in how many categories languages recognize, where they place the boundaries between them, and how semantic elements are <b>apportioned</b> to different <b>parts</b> of the predicate. In the second, developmental phase of the project, a new ‘child-friendly’ set of videotaped ‘cutting and breaking’ events was used to elicit descriptions from child and adult speakers of DUTCH, TAMIL, and MANDARIN CHINESE (3 age groups per language, 10 subjects per group: 4 yrs., 6 yrs., adult). Multivariate statistical and qualitative analyses reveal that although children identify the relevant construction patterns and approximate the semantic categories of the target language by as early as age 4, they are still shifting and fine-tuning category boundaries even as late as age 6. Discussion will highlight not only substantive findings, including the ongoing process of semantic category construction, but also the methodological innovations of this study: new techniques for exploring semantic structure in large crosslinguistic data sets...|$|R
40|$|Where a party wrongfully suffers harm {{due to the}} {{negligent conduct}} of another, that harm is {{repaired}} through the payment of damages. In terms of the principle res perit domino, it is however a fundamental principle {{of the law of}} delict that a person should bear the loss he suffers. It stands to reason that where he contributes to his damages by his own negligent conduct, this should be taken into account and his damages reduced accordingly. The legal position regarding contributory negligence and the effect on recovery of damages, is governed by the Apportionment of Damages Act 34 of 1956. The relevance of the Act is often considered when dealing with the issue of liability; however, it ultimately effects the quantum of a damages award. This {{is not to say that}} the apportionment of liability will or should mirror the extent to which the damages are apportioned. In certain cases, damages may be further apportioned to account for other factors. In practice, the Act is often exercised incorrectly and differently from case to case, due to varying interpretations and approaches to underlying principles. The Act does not define concepts fundamental thereto nor does it prescribe an approach to determine the reduction of a party’s damages. Specifically the meaning of fault in the Act, whether this fault relates to the damage or damage-causing event, as well as how this fault should be measured and applied to the facts of each case have been interpreted and applied inconsistently. The highlight the various scenaria that have appeared in the practical application of the Act to claims arising out of delict and specifically, motor vehicle collisions. Through practical illustrations and case law, one can deliberate on the factors to be considered when a particular approach is adopted. It is ultimately necessary to determine whether the Act can be applied effectively and fairly, by adopting a single approach, or whether the law has to be revised. If the Act were to be reviewed, the extent to which negligent conduct is to be applied as well as how this is to be assessed should be clarified. It is necessary for courts to bear in mind that a person’s conduct as it is causally linked to harm, should be apportioned and a separate enquiry to extent to which harm is exacerbated by contributory negligence should be done. Mere negligent conduct is not sufficient – it must be linked to increased harm. As it stands, he approach followed in the Jones case provides for a definable formula in which the parties’ conduct as it relates to the harm are assessed separately and then compared. If the comparative approach can be enforced, uniformity will be achieved and the uncertainty of discretionary application can be eliminated, even if the Act is not redrafted. If legal practitioners are able to clearly make this distinction and <b>apportion</b> the <b>parts</b> to which a claimant’s actions are related, the purpose of the Act can be achieved.

The basic component of the municipal budget consists of funding from the State, where the municipalities further funds <b>apportioned</b> on the <b>part</b> of the sectoral into groups, sections, subsections and paragraphs. Funding for emergency measures to protect the population constitutes Section five national security and legal protection. The main instrument of financial security and the preparation of budget expenditures {{in the group of}} five is a law on crisis management, law on IRS and the law on budgetary composition. Current legislation talks about financial security crisis measures and financial reserves. The amount of funding is not provided by law. The funds are intended to ensure that preparations crisis situations, respond to and remediate according to the emergency act and tasks set by law on integrated rescue systém. The aim of work is to analyze the practical part of any revenues of municipalities. Further analyze budgetary expenditures, which are intended to provide emergency measures, including protection of the population. The aim is to that under the current legislation municipalities spend funds according to budget chapters on crisis measures and whether the financial reserve is sufficient. The research question was posed subsequently: "Do municipalities create a reserve funds for emergency security measures determined to them by the legislation of the Czech republic?". The research sample is consisted of three municipalities of the cadastral area Tabor. Municipalities are similar in size and population. The municipality Planá nad Lužnicí is different in geographic positioning, where {{on the edge of the}} village flows the river Lužnice. The crisis plan of Tábor is not publicly publishable, but a general knowledge may arise following crisis situation: flooding in large scale, epidemics, radiation accidents, disruption of gas and heat supplies, and other natural disasters. This is a risk or potential incident, which can initiate an emergency situation. Each municipality is the promoter JPO 3 and in the village is a unit of volunteer firefighters. The potential risk and rise crisis situation can affect all three municipalities surveyed. When comparing expenditures to a group of five national security, a comparison was made including subsection 531, which is according the budgetary rules led to the municipal police, CCTV (closed-circuit television) etc. Furthermore, municipal expenditures were compared separately to section 52 and section 55. In Section 52, the amount of funds according to the surveyed year was for example, 0 %, 0. 1 %, 0. 4 %, 2. 9 %. Section 55 was significantly different and the amount of funds was for example 82 %, 97 %, 100 %. The exception is 2013, when all three municipalities have significantly increased funding in Section 52. These funds reached 12. 2 %, 17. 4 % and 47. 5 % of the expenditure of sector part. A more detailed research showed that communities do not always have budgeted expenditure for emergency measures as required by law. Often in the budgetary composition in the expenditure of section 5 is not a subsection protection of population, subsection crisis management or other components and operation of the integrated rescue system. Subsection 521 protection of the population was only in village Mladá Vožice in all four surveyed financial years. Other municipalities in the mentioned subsections did not have any funds. The analysis carried out in the sectoral budgetary expenditure of the group of five - national security can be evaluated that municipalities do not create a financial reserve funds as imposed by current legislation. The results will be made available to municipalities and regional authorities. The work will be provided to crisis managers, schools with a similar field, to improve the educational process...|$|R
