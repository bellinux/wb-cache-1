40|$|Saline soil is {{a serious}} problem worldwide, and it is {{necessary}} to improve the salt tolerance of plants to avoid the progressive deterioration of saline soil. Agrobacterium based system was employed to transfer a vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporter (<b>AtNHX</b> 1) <b>gene</b> into tobacco leaf discs. Hundred thirty putative transgenic tobacco plants were obtained. The leaf painting assay was applied to select the transformants containing the bar gene (basta herbicide resistance). In addition, the stable integration of the <b>AtNHX</b> 1 <b>gene</b> was confirmed by PCR analysis. The expression of encoding sequence <b>AtNHX</b> 1 <b>gene</b> was detected by the accumulation of salt in the transgenic tobacco plants under the salt stress conditions. Transgenic tobacco plants expressing the <b>AtNHX</b> 1 <b>gene</b> were able to grow in the presence of 150 to 300 mM NaCl and accumulated significantly at high concentrations of sodium ions in the leaves. However, the wild type plants could not tolerate a concentration up to 150 mM NaCl. This remarkable high salt tolerance in transgenic tobacco plants can be helpful in the future for applying important phytoremdiation plants in high saline lands...|$|R
40|$|The Arabidopsis thaliana vacuolar Na + /H + antiporter AtNHX 1 is a salt {{tolerance}} determinant. Predicted {{amino acid sequence}} similarity, protein topology {{and the presence of}} functional domains conserved in AtNHX 1 and prototypical mammalian NHE Na + /H + exchangers led to the identi®cation of ®ve additional <b>AtNHX</b> <b>genes</b> (<b>AtNHX</b> 2 ± 6). The AtNHX 1 and AtNHX 2 mRNAs are the most prevalent transcripts among this family of genes in seedling shoots and roots. A lower-abundance AtNHX 5 mRNA is present in both shoots and roots, whereas AtNHX 3 transcript is expressed predominantly in roots. AtNHX 4 and AtNHX 6 mRNAs were detected only by RT±PCR. AtNHX 1, 2 or 5 suppress, with differential ef®cacy, the Na + /Li +-sensitive phenotype of a yeast mutant that is de®cient in the endosomal/vacuolar Na + /H + antiporter ScNHX 1. Ion accumulation data indicate that these AtNHX proteins function to facilitate Na + ion compartmentalization and maintain intracellular K + status. Seedling steady-state mRNA levels of AtNHX 1 and AtNHX 2 increase similarly after treatment with NaCl, an equi-osmolar concentration of sorbitol, or ABA, whereas AtNHX 5 transcript abundance increases only in response to salt treatment. Hyper-osmotic up-regulation of AtNHX 1, 2 or 5 expression is not dependent on the SOS pathway that controls ion homeostasis. However, steady-state AtNHX 1, 2 and 5 transcript abundance is greater in sos 1, sos 2 and sos 3 plants growing in medium that is not supplemented with sorbitol or NaCl, providin...|$|R
40|$|Salinity {{is one of}} {{the main}} causes of yield loss in {{agricultural}} crop production worldwide. Numerous attempts have been made to produce salinity tolerant crops by manipulating the expression of genes involved in ion transport; yet, the reported results are often rather controversial. In this work, Arabidopsis <b>AtNHX</b> 1 <b>gene</b> encoding vacuolar Na?/H? exchanger was introduced into barley (Horduem vulgare L. cv. Golden Promise) plants grown under saline conditions. Transgenic plants were compared to null segregants for biomass, water content, gas exchange, and Na? and K? content of the leaf. It was shown that most of the lines expressing AtNHX 1 have no significant difference to null segregants, suggesting the lack of beneficial effect of expressing the <b>AtNHX</b> 1 <b>gene</b> in barley, at least under our experimental conditions. The lack of phenotype might be explained by: (1) low level of activity of vacuolar H?-inorganic pyrophosphatase and vacuolar H?-ATPase resulting in an insufficient proton gradient required for the vacuolar Na?/H? exchanger; (2) the inability of transgenic plants to prevent a passive leak of sodium via Na? permeable slow activating and fast activating channels; (3) insufficient ATP pool to support H? pumping activity; and (4) the fact that the AtNHX 1 protein might not been properly folded, inactive or incorrectly targeted. Overall, this study suggests that, while targeting vacuolar Na? sequestration, at least several genes need to be pyramided to ensure the efficiency of the above process. Getnet D. Adem, Stuart J.

30|$|In Arabidopsis, six <b>AtNHX</b> <b>genes</b> were identified, whose gene {{products}} {{can be divided}} into two classes, class I (AtNHX 1 - 4) and class II (AtNHX 5 and 6) (Pardo et al. [2006]). All class I transporters characterized to date are targeted to the tonoplast (Pardo et al. [2006]). The SOS 2 /CIPK 24 protein kinase has been found to involve the regulation of class I NHX-mediated tonoplast Na+/H+ exchange in Arabidopsis (Qiu et al. [2004]). Tonoplast vesicles from sos 2 mutant plants but not from either sos 1 or sos 3 mutant plants exhibited a significant reduction in the Na+/H+ exchange activity (Qiu et al. [2004]), suggesting that SOS 2 /CIPK 24 also functions in vacuolar Na+ sequestration presumably with some CBL(s) other than SOS 3 /CBL 4. Unlike vacuolar-localized class I transporters, AtNHX 5 and 6 class II transporters were postulated to function in endosomal vesicles (Pardo et al. [2006]). A recent study demonstrated that AtNHX 5 and AtNHX 6 indeed localize at endosomal compartments associated with Golgi and the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and loss of functions of both transporters rendered the atnhx 5 atnhx 6 double mutant plants more salt sensitive (Bassil et al. [2011]). Moreover, the atnhx 5 atnhx 6 plants exhibited reduced growth phenotypes even under normal growth condition. These phenotypes include decreases in leaf cell size and number in addition to the impairment of vesicular trafficking to the vacuole (Bassil et al. [2011]). These findings suggest that class II NHX-mediated ion homeostasis in endosomal compartments affects protein trafficking from the Golgi/TGN to the vacuole, which could cause increased sensitivity to salinity due to the deficiency in supply of essential components such as AtNHX 1 into vacuoles when plants face salinity stress (Bassil et al. [2011]). For more details of NHX proteins, see reviews: (Pardo et al. [2006]; Rodríguez-Rosales et al. [2009]; Yamaguchi et al. [2999].|$|R
40|$|Aim Our {{objective}} was to test whether the overexpression of the Arabidopsis thaliana tonoplast Na+/H+ antiporter <b>gene,</b> <b>AtNHX</b> 1, can improve salt tolerance in poplar. Methods Transgenic and wild-type poplar (Populus × euramericana ‘Neva’) were subjected to low salt and high salt treatments. We investigated the effects of NaCl on the transgenic and wild-type poplar by measuring growth parameters, chlorophyll (Chl) and carotenoid (Car) content, net photosynthetic rate (Pn), maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm), ion content, leaf malondialdehyde (MDA) and electrolytic leakage after 30 days. Important findings Compared with the control, the growth of wild-type plants was restrained significantly {{in the presence of}} both low salt and high salt. The dry weight of wild-type plants was significantly lower under salt stress than that of control, the dry weight decreased gradually with increasing NaCl concentration and their dry weight under high salt was just 50 % of the control. However, the dry weight of transgenic plants in low salt was similar to the control up to the high salt treatment, where their dry weight was 74 % of the control. Moreover, the dry weight of transgenic plants was significant higher than that of wild-type in both NaCl treatments, and the discrepancy of dry weight was increased with increasing NaCl concentration. In the presence of NaCl, Chl and Carcontent of transgenic plants were significantly higher than that of wild-type, and the transgenic plants maintained a remarkably high Pn and Fv/Fm. Although these transgenic plants accumulated more Na+ in their roots and leaf tissues under salinity conditions compared with the wild-type plants, they absorbed more K+ and maintained a higher K+/Na+ ratio. Moreover, these transgenic plants kept a lower MDA and electrolytic leakage level than that of wild-type. These findings indicate that transformation of <b>AtNHX</b> 1 <b>gene</b> into poplar can confer plants more tolerance to salinity than wild-type poplar by maintaining better growth, higher Chl and Car content and improved Pn and Fv/Fm. These transgenic plants have potential for further applications in saline soil...|$|R
40|$|A {{family of}} <b>AtNHX</b> 1 -like <b>genes</b> of Arabidopsis thaliana, coding for vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporters, was cloned and {{functionally}} characterized by their heterologous expression in yeast mutants lacking an endosomal vacuolar antiporter. The expression {{of all of}} the AtNHX members of the family provided a recovery of the salt sensitive yeast mutant, supporting their role in Na+/H+ exchange. RT-PCR, used to determine the relative abundance of the AtNHX transcripts, showed that while AtNHX 1 and AtNHX 2 transcripts were abundant and widely distributed in all tissues, AtNHX 3 and AtNHX 4 transcripts were almost exclusively detected in flower and root tissues, respectively. AtNHX 5 transcripts were observed at very low levels in all tissues. The potential for the use of these genes for the engineering of salt tolerance in crop plants is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Drought and {{salinity}} are {{two major}} limiting factors in crop productivity. One way to reduce crop loss caused by drought and salinity {{is to increase the}} solute concentration in the vacuoles of plant cells. The accumulation of sodium ions inside the vacuoles provides a 2 -fold advantage: (i) reducing the toxic levels of sodium in cytosol; and (ii) increasing the vacuolar osmotic potential with the concomitant generation of a more negative water potential that favors water uptake by the cell and better tissue water retention under high soil salinity. The success of this approach was demonstrated in several plants, where the overexpression of the Arabidopsis <b>gene</b> <b>AtNHX</b> 1 that encodes a vacuolar sodium/proton antiporter resulted in higher plant salt tolerance. Overexpression of AtNHX 1 increases sodium uptake in vacuoles, which leads t...|$|R
40|$|AtNHX 5 and AtNHX 6, the endosomal Na+,K+/H+ antiporters in Arabidopsis, play an {{important}} role in plant growth and development. However, their function in K+ and pH homeostasis remains unclear. In this report, we characterized the function of AtNHX 5 and AtNHX 6 in K+ and H+ homeostasis in Arabidopsis. Using a yeast expression system, we found that AtNHX 5 and AtNHX 6 recovered tolerance to high K+ or salt. We further found that AtNHX 5 and AtNHX 6 functioned at high K+ at acidic pH while AtCHXs at low K+ under alkaline conditions. In addition, we showed that the nhx 5 nhx 6 double mutant contained less K+ and was sensitive to low K+ treatment. Overexpression of AtNHX 5 or <b>AtNHX</b> 6 <b>gene</b> in nhx 5 nhx 6 recovered root growth to the wild-type level. Three conserved acidic residues, D 164, E 188, and D 193 in AtNHX 5 and D 165, E 189, and D 194 in AtNHX 6, were essential for K+ homeostasis and plant growth. nhx 5 nhx 6 had a reduced vacuolar and cellular pH as measured with the fluorescent pH indicator BCECF or semimicroelectrode. We further show that AtNHX 5 and AtNHX 6 are localized to Golgi and TGN. Taken together, AtNHX 5 and AtNHX 6 play {{an important}} role in K+ and pH homeostasis in Arabidopsis. Three conserved acidic residues are essential for K+ transport...|$|R
40|$|Plant vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporters play {{important}} roles in maintaining cellular ion homeostasis and mediating the transport of Na+ out of the cytosol and into the vacuole. Vacuolar antiporters {{have been shown to}} play significant roles in salt tolerance; however the relatively low Vmax of the Na+/H+ exchange of the Na+/H+ antiporters identified could limit its application in the molecular breeding of salt tolerant crops. In this study, we applied DNA shuffling methodology to generate and recombine the mutations of Arabidopsis thaliana vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporter <b>gene</b> <b>AtNHX</b> 1. Screening using a large scale yeast complementation system identified AtNHXS 1, a novel Na+/H+ antiporter. Expression of AtNHXS 1 in yeast showed that the antiporter localized to the vacuolar membrane and that its expression improved the tolerance of yeast to NaCl, KCl, LiCl, and hygromycin B. Measurements of the ion transport activity across the intact yeast vacuole demonstrated that the AtNHXS 1 protein showed higher Na+/H+ exchange activity and a slightly improved K+/H+ exchange activity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSalinity is {{the main}} {{limiting}} factor of plant growth and agricultural productivity. A lot of previous works showed that the introduction of Na+/H+ antiporter gene could improve the tolerance of plants to salt. In this study, a vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporter <b>gene,</b> <b>AtNHX</b> 1 from Arobidopsis, was transferred into kiwifruit by Agrobacterium-mediated protocol. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blot analysis confirmed that AtNHX 1 was successfully integrated into the kiwifruit genome. Reverse transcription (RT) -PCR analysis indicated that AtNHX 1 expressed highly in transgenic plants. It was found that transgenic kiwifruit plants exhibited improved resistance to 200 mmol/l NaCl in comparison with wide-type plants. Under salt stress, these transgenic lines accumulated more Na+ than control, due to an increased Na+/H+ antiporter activity. In physiological analysis, the traits such as osmotic adjustment and antioxidation capability of transgenic lines under salt stress were obviously {{higher than that of}} wide-type plants. These results suggested that the overexpression of vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporter gene could increase the salt tolerance of kiwifruit...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that ubiquitination plays {{important}} roles in plant abiotic stress responses. In the present study, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme gene GmUBC 2, a homologue of yeast RAD 6, was cloned from soybean and functionally characterized. GmUBC 2 was expressed in all tissues in soybean and was up-regulated by drought and salt stress. Arabidopsis plants overexpressing GmUBC 2 were more tolerant to salinity and drought stresses compared with the control plants. Through expression analyses of putative downstream genes in the transgenic plants, we found that the expression levels of two ion antiporter <b>genes</b> <b>AtNHX</b> 1 and AtCLCa, a key gene involved in the biosynthesis of proline, AtP 5 CS, and the copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase gene AtCCS, were all increased significantly in the transgenic plants. These results suggest that GmUBC 2 is involved in the regulation of ion homeostasis, osmolyte synthesis, and oxidative stress responses. Our results also suggest that modulation of the ubiquitination pathway could be an effective means of improving salt and drought tolerance in plants through genetic engineering...|$|R
40|$|Plants {{are exposed}} to various {{environmental}} stresses during their life cycle such as salt, drought and cold. Natural variation mediated plant growth adaptation has been employed as an effective approach {{in response to the}} diverse environmental cues such as salt stress. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this process is not well understood. In the present study, a collection of 82 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions (ecotypes) was screened with a view to identify variation for salinity tolerance. Seven accessions showed a higher level of tolerance than Col- 0. The young seedlings of the tolerant accessions demonstrated a higher K(+) content and a lower Na(+) /K(+) ratio when exposed to salinity stress, but its Na(+) content was {{the same as that of}} Col- 0. The K(+) transporter genes AtHAK 5, AtCHX 17 and AtKUP 1 were up-regulated significantly in almost all the tolerant accessions, even in the absence of salinity stress. There was little genetic variation or positive transcriptional variation between the selections and Col- 0 with respect to Na+-related transporter genes, as AtSOS <b>genes,</b> <b>AtNHX</b> 1 and AtHKT 1; 1. In addition, under salinity stress, these selections accumulated higher compatible solutes and lower reactive oxygen species than did Col- 0.

40|$|Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.), {{is second}} {{important}} cash crop in Pakistan, but yield is low {{due to a}} number of factors. Among these, biotic (insect, pest, diseases) and abiotic (drought, salt, low and high temperature) stresses are major one, which cause loss to sugarcane crop. Sugarcane requires high delta of water and moisture stress at growth phase causes considerable yield loss (~ 17 %). In case of severe shortage of water or prolonged drought conditions, yield loss may rise up to 70 % and some time complete crop failure. Saline and saline sodic soils also hinder sugarcane production in Pakistan. Sugarcane varietal improvement through conventional breeding is difficult in Pakistan, due to lack of viable cane fuzz production. Through the application of biotechnological approaches, transgenic sugarcane could be developed for better cane and sugar yield per unit area. The target for specific trait improvement could be achieved through the transformation of single or multiple genes. The present study was conducted with the objectives to optimize ideal tissue culture system for different commercial and promising clones of sugarcane and genetic transformation of multiple <b>genes</b> (<b>AtNHX</b> 1, AVP 1 and Cry 1 Ac) in the better tissue culture responding clones through particle gene gun method. Tissue culture system was established for the five commercially grown (HSF- 240, SPF- 213, SPF- 237, CPF- 245, CPF- 246), and two promising sugarcane clones (CSSG- 668, CSSG- 676). Optimal medium composition for callusing, embryogenesis, regeneration, rooting and selection of transformed sugarcane plants were achieved. The best callus induction was found in the media combination (4 mgL- 1 2, 4 -D, 0. 5 gL- 1 casein hydrolysate, 3. 5 mgL- 1 each of arginine, glycine, cystine and 7. 5 % coconut H 2 O). For regeneration, the media combination SR- 3 (0. 25 mg L- 1 2, 4 -D, 2. 5 mgL- 1 each of arginine, glycine and cystine, 1. 5, 0. 25, 0. 50 mgL- 1 BAP, Kinetin and NAA respectively) was observed optimal. For the profuse roots development of the regenerated plantlets, 3. 5 IBA and 2. 5 mgL- 1 BAP was found best medium combination. For the selection of transformed sugarcane calli and plantlets, geneticin at 40 - 60 mgL- 1 was found optimum. The best tissue culture responsive sugarcane clones (HSF- 240 and CSSG- 668) were selected for the transformation and integration of multiple genes in the combinations; C- 1 (AVP 1 and Cry 1 Ac), C- 2 (AVP 1 and AtNHX 1) and C- 3 (AtNHX 1 and Cry 1 Ac) through biolistic transformation method. Embryogenic calli of the selected sugarcane clones were bombarded in 42 batches. Two hundred and ninety putative transgenic sugarcane lines were obtained after selection at regeneration. Out of these, 177 plantlets produced roots on rooting selection medium. The putative transgenic plants were initially screened through kanamycin leaf assay and 168 were found resistant which were further confirmed through PCR amplification of the selection marker npt 11 gene. Out of the selected putative transgenic lines, 155 were found PCR positive. The npt 11 positive plants were then used to amplify specific genes. The PCR results showed 38 plants positive for AVP 1, 34 for Cry 1 Ac, 32 for AtNHX 1, 15 for AVP 1 and Cry 1 Ac, 13 for AVP 1 and AtNHX 1, and 13 for Cry 1 Ac and AtNHX 1. Integration pattern was confirmed through Southern analysis. There was observed random integration pattern, two to six insertions of transgene in each line. Biological assay for top borers was conducted for the plants positive for Cry 1 Ac gene, in controlled conditions. The transgenic lines positive for Cry 1 Ac gene showed significant resistance to top borer (Scirpophaga novella) as compared to the control (non transgenic). Selected transgenic plants positive for AVP 1 and AtNHX 1 were planted in pots and micro plots under salt stress and water deficient conditions, for the agronomic and physiological studies. Agronomic parameters such as germination %, cane girth, length and weight were studied. There was found better response of the transgenics for quantitative and qualitative characteristics. Transgenic lines showed significant tolerance for deficient irrigation (80 and 63 %) and salt stress (E. Ce 7. 5 and 10 dS m- 1) as compared to the non transgenic lines. Studies on diversity among Saccharum complex for lignin related genes, showed 43 % polymorphism. Principal coordinate analysis showed that, 29 % of the total variation was explained by the genotypes with respect to the lignin-related genes. The association of genetic variation in Saccharum complex will be helpful in designing breeding strategies for the development of superior energy cane with more biomass. Multiple gene integration in sugarcane will be helpful for tolerance against biotic (borers) and abiotic (drought and salt) stresses, which ultimately will lead to higher cane and sugar yield with better economic return to the farmers and sugar industry...|$|R
