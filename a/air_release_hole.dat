50|$|Fine bubble {{diffusers}} {{have largely}} replaced coarse bubble diffusers and mechanical aerators {{in most of}} the developed world and in much of the developing world. The exception would be in secondary treatment phases, such as activated sludge processing tanks, where 85 to 90 percent of any remaining solid materials (floating on the surface) are removed through settling or biological processes. The biological process uses air to encourage bacterial growth that would consume many of these waste materials, such as phosphorus and nitrogen that are dissolved in the wastewater. The larger <b>air</b> <b>release</b> openings of a coarse bubble diffuser helps to facilitate a higher oxygen transfer rate and bacterial growth. One disadvantage of using fine bubble diffusers in activated sludge tanks is the tendency of floc (particle) clogging the small <b>air</b> <b>release</b> <b>holes.</b>|$|R

40|$|Air {{contamination}} strongly {{decreases the}} efficiency of fluid power systems and when the allowable limits are exceeded, {{the performance of the}} system deteriorates. The hydraulic reservoir performs the function of <b>releasing</b> the entrained <b>air</b> of the hydraulic system to the surroundings. In recent years, the reservoir design has become an important task {{in the design of the}} hydraulic system due to space restrictions forcing the use of small sized reservoirs. Despite this fact, experimental results on an <b>air</b> <b>release</b> are not available. In this paper, an experimental investigation of the <b>air</b> <b>release</b> in hydraulic reservoirs is presented. A test apparatus using an optical method as well as the post-processing of the results is described. These are given in terms of an <b>air</b> <b>release</b> rate for different reservoir designs over a wide range of oil flow rates and air loads. The current study is a significant step forward in the design of fluid power systems, as it provides an experimental procedure to measure the <b>air</b> <b>release</b> in the hydraulic reservoir as well as its quantitative analysis...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} predict more {{accurately}} the pressure transients accompanying <b>air</b> <b>release</b> and vaporous cavitation inside oil-hydraulic low pressure pipelines, a new method using genetic algorithms (GAs) for parameter identification is described. A mathematical model for pressure and flow transients {{is presented in}} which models of vaporous cavitation and dynamic <b>air</b> <b>release</b> and re-solution are incorporated. This model enables the prediction of both the vaporous cavitation and the air bubble volumes in the pipeline during the transients following a sudden cut-off of the flow. The accurate prediction of behavior largely depends on three generally unknown parameters required by the model, namely: the initial air bubble volume in the oil, and the <b>air</b> <b>release</b> and re-solution time constants. Through {{the use of the}} GAs, these parameters can be identified. Predicted results and experimental data show close correspondence...|$|R

40|$|This study {{represents}} {{an analysis of}} the effect of exposure to ambient ozone and toxic <b>air</b> <b>releases</b> on hospitalization for asthma and respiratory illnesses in Harris County, Texas from 2009 to 2013. Although the adverse health effects of ozone and air toxics have been documented in the literature, evidence regarding the respiratory health effects of these pollutants in Harris County, Texas, is limited. A study of this relationship in Harris County is particularly important due to its high levels of ambient ozone; an extensive network of air pollution monitoring systems; a cluster of petrochemical industries; the high levels of industrial emissions resulting from the large network of industries along the Houston Ship Channel; and the potential air pollution due to the large road network and vehicular traffic in the region. ^ Our study identified temporal and spatial variations in asthma hospitalization across the study region, and explored the combined effect of exposure to ambient ozone and air toxics on asthma and respiratory illnesses. A variable was created for seasons of the year, and analyses were performed separately for selected pulmonary irritants, and for all chemical pollutants. We used the ArcGIS tools and SAS 9. 4 to perform spatial and statistical analysis respectively. Average maximum 8 -hr ozone concentrations per zip code were interpolated using kriging to predict ozone measures in zip codes without ozone monitors. Our spatial analysis showed that asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) hot spots and clusters were located in zip codes that are relatively closer to zip codes of facilities with high toxic <b>air</b> <b>releases</b> and emission events located around the Houston ship channel area. ^ Asthma and COPD hospitalization rates per 10, 000 people were determined to be highest in either first or fourth quarter of each study year from 2009 to 2013. Bivariate analysis using the Generalized Linear model found that asthma hospitalization rate per 10, 000 people was significantly associated with total <b>air</b> <b>releases</b> reported under the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI), as well as a combination of TRI total <b>air</b> <b>releases</b> and toxic emissions events <b>air</b> <b>releases</b> reported by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality(TCEQ) in children 17 years and younger. Using zip codes that reported zero emissions as reference, asthma hospitalization rate per 10, 000 people was estimated to be 0. 29 and 0. 33 units higher when zip code levels of TRI toxic <b>air</b> <b>releases,</b> as well as combined TRI toxic <b>air</b> <b>releases</b> and TCEQ toxic emission events releases in pounds were 0 – 40 and 40 – 400, with p-value of 0. 03 and 0. 02 respectively for the selected pulmonary irritants. Similarly, asthma hospitalization per 10, 000 people in children 17 years and younger was estimated to be 0. 32 and 0. 35 units higher when TRI toxic <b>air</b> <b>releases,</b> as well as combined TRI toxic <b>air</b> <b>releases</b> and TCEQ toxic emissions events release levels per zip code were above 400 lbs. with p-values of 0. 03 and 0. 01 respectively for the selected pulmonary irritants. Statistically significant results were also obtained for all released chemical pollutants. ^ In adults 18 years and above, a statistically significant effect was only observed when the levels of the selected air toxics were at the highest categorization (above 400 lbs). Asthma hospitalization per 10, 00 people in adults 18 years and above at this pollutant level was estimated to be 0. 29 and 0. 33 units higher with p-values of 0. 008 and 0. 02 respectively in zip codes with reported TRI toxic <b>air</b> <b>release</b> as well as combined TCEQ toxic emission events release and TRI toxic <b>air</b> <b>releases</b> respectively, for the selected pollutants. At pollutants levels above 400 pounds, statistically significant results were also obtained for all released chemical pollutants. Black race, average income per household, and season were significantly associated with asthma hospitalization in both children and adults. ^ In an adjusted regression controlling for our covariates, only season became a significant predictor (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001) of asthma and COPD hospitalization in both adults and children. An examination of the combined effect of ozone and toxic <b>air</b> <b>releases</b> showed that there is no significant interaction between the two variables relative to asthma and COPD hospitalization in both children and adults. We conclude that the major predictor of asthma and COPD hospitalization is season, with hospitalization rate per 10, 000 people for asthma and COPD being highest in winter period when ozone levels are usually lowest. ...|$|R
