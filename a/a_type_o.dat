5000|$|The third {{sensitization}} {{model can}} occur in women of blood type O. The immune response to A and B antigens, that are widespread in the environment, usually leads {{to the production of}} IgM or IgG anti-A and anti-B antibodies early in life. Women of blood type O are more prone than women of types A and B to making IgG anti-A and anti-B antibodies, and these IgG antibodies are able to cross the placenta. For unknown reasons, the incidence of maternal antibodies against type A and B antigens of the IgG type that could potentially cause hemolytic disease of the newborn is greater than the observed incidence of [...] "ABO disease." [...] About 15% of pregnancies involve <b>a</b> <b>type</b> <b>O</b> mother and a type A or type B child; only 3% of these pregnancies result in hemolytic disease due to A/B/O incompatibility. In contrast to antibodies to A and B antigens, Rhesus antibodies are generally not produced from exposure to environmental antigens. In cases where there is ABO incompatibility and Rh incompatibility, the risk of alloimmunization is decreased because fetal red blood cells are removed from maternal circulation due to anti-ABO antibodies before they can trigger an anti-Rh response.|$|E

A pterygium is a fibrovascular neoformation charac-terized as triangular wing-shaped overgrowth of abnormal conjunctiva onto the cornea and is composed of epithelium and highly vascular, sub-epithelial, loose connective tissue [1]. In severe cases, a pterygium can grow into the central cornea, induce irregular corneal astigmatism, and even result in vision loss [2]. Currently, the main therapeutic method is surgical removal with a high rate of recurrence [3]. The pathogenesis and mechanism of the pterygium remain largely unknown.

Measurements in GIS are taken by sensors such as cameras and global positioning systems. A manual process is then used for inputting data that cannot easily be processed automatically. The measurements are discretized, for example, by imposing a regular, multidimensional discrete grid over the surface to be measured, allowing points of interest to lie only {{at the intersection of}} the grid lines. In addition to the error imposed by this discretization process, measurement errors also reduce the accuracy of attribute values. The data input therefore needs validation.
