In spite of this, problems still persist in this industry, including low productivity due to mishandling of raw material in post-harvest operations. One of the prime causes of this is manual grading/sorting of fresh fruit bunches, which is prone to error and misjudgement, as well as subjectivity. High demand of oil palm establishes its high price in world market, which drives the industry to expand its plantation area to increase production. Ultimately, it compromise forests and agricultural land, resulting stagnation or decline in several food products. Alternatively, before expanding plantation extent, oil extraction productivity of existing plantation can be improved by carefully selecting appropriate FFBs for post-harvest processing through introduction of automation. The use of machine vision and spectral analysis has shown to assist productivity of <b>agricultural</b> <b>processing</b> <b>industry.</b> This study employs automation technology for FFB grading in oil palm mills, resulting in improved raw material quality, thereby increasing the oil extraction productivity, and simultaneously contributing to partly release the pressure of deforestation by maintaining green agricultural areas...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Cyclone {{separators}} {{are widely}} used in <b>agricultural</b> <b>processing</b> <b>industries</b> as air pollution abatement devices. The Texas A&M Cyclone Design (TCD) method is a simple method for designing cyclones based on an inlet design velocity. The TCD method specifies “ideal ” inlet velocities of 975 120 m/min (3200 400 fpm) and 914 120 m/min (3000 400 fpm) for 1 D 3 D and 2 D 2 D cyclones, respectively. There is evidence that higher dust collection efficiencies may be obtained from cyclones using different inlet velocities than those specified as the “ideal ” velocity. This article quantifies the inlet velocities at which maximum collection efficiencies are obtained for 1 D 3 D and 2 D 2 D cyclones and the marginal pressure drop associated with reaching these collection efficiencies. It is demonstrated that for large particles, the collection efficiency of six inch diameter 1 D 3 D and 2 D 2 D cyclones is similar for inlet velocities from 10. 16 standard m/s (2000 fpm) up to the design velocity, with significantly lower pressure drop at lower inlet velocities...|$|R

This is exemplified in Uzbekistan, Central Asia, where irrigated agriculture is the primary source of the livelihoods of the rural population that makes more than 60 % of all inhabitants. Yet, socio-economic and ecological challenges keep growing, also due to the inefficient management of water resources. Therefore, options to increase water use efficiency were analyzed while considering the entire supply chain of products including the production, processing, consumption and trade stages and processes. These options were analyzed through an elaborated environmentally extended input-output model. The options examined throughout the entire supply chain included: (i) implementing advanced field-level water saving technologies, (ii) increasing crop diversity through expanding fruits and vegetables production and reducing the area of current dominant crops (cotton and paddy rice in downstream), (iii) fostering the further development of less-water demanding <b>agricultural</b> <b>processing</b> <b>industries,</b> (iv) upgrading production value chains by expanding the production of the commodities with higher values added, (v) reducing production and consumption losses, and (vi) diversifying exports by replacing the current cotton fiber exports with cotton commodities of higher values added. The findings may spur decision-makers to formulating strategic priorities at national level and coordinating water uses considering comprehensively technical, economic and ecological aspects along the entire supply chain, which is a key element of IWRM concepts. However, it is argued that increasing water use efficiency through technological and economic transformation reforms necessitates the empowerment of water users, raising their awareness for, and providing the institutional and market infrastructure, which is in-line with IWRM principles as well.

40|$|Cyclone {{separators}} {{are widely}} used in <b>agricultural</b> <b>processing</b> <b>industries</b> as air pollution abatement devices. The performance of cyclones {{is a function of}} the geometry of the cyclone, operating parameters, and the particle size distribution (PSD) of the entrained aerosol. Multiple models have been proposed to predict the performance of cyclones given different geometric proportions, but many of these models do not quantify changes in performance with changes in inlet velocity or cyclone diameter given fixed geometric proportions. The Texas A&M Cyclone Design (TCD) method is a simple method for designing cyclones based on an inlet design velocity. The TCD method specifies ??ideal?? inlet velocities of 975 ?? 120 m/min (3200 ?? 400 fpm) and 914 ?? 120 m/min (3000 ?? 400 fpm) for 1 D 3 D and 2 D 2 D cyclones, respectively. However, there is evidence that higher dust collection efficiencies may be obtained from cyclones using different inlet velocities than those specified as the ??ideal?? velocity. Furthermore, the TCD method assumes that cyclone performance is independent of cyclone diameter. The present research demonstrates that, for large particles, the collection efficiency of 15. 24 cm (six inch) diameter 1 D 3 D and 2 D 2 D cyclones is similar for inlet velocities from 10. 16 standard m/s (2000 fpm) up to the design velocity, with significantly lower pressure drop at lower inlet velocities, resulting in lower energy requirements. However, the performance of cyclones is a function of cyclone diameter. Using similar operating parameters, the collection efficiency of a 60. 96 cm (24 inch) diameter 1 D 3 D cyclone was significantly lower (&# 945; = 0. 05) than that of a 15. 24 and a 30. 48 cm (6 and 12 inch) diameter cyclone, and the collection efficiency of a 91. 44 cm (36 inch) cyclone was significantly lower (&# 945; = 0. 05) than that of a 60. 96 cm (24 inch) diameter cyclone.
