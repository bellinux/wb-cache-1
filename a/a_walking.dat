5|$|Halkett's first {{design was}} a {{collapsible}} and inflatable boat made of rubber-impregnated cloth. When deflated, {{the hull of}} the boat could be worn as a cloak, the oar used as <b>a</b> <b>walking</b> stick, and the sail as an umbrella. This {{was followed by a}} two-man craft that was small enough to fit into a knapsack, and when deflated served as a waterproof blanket.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{purpose of}} this study is the {{development}} of an admittance motion command generator for controlling the motion of <b>a</b> robotic <b>walking</b> support system used to guide <b>a</b> user <b>walking</b> at <b>a</b> uniform or user-adjustable <b>walking</b> velocity along <b>a</b> preplanned <b>walking</b> path, as illustrated by parametric spline functions. The correlation between <b>a</b> preplanned <b>walking</b> path and the force exerted by a user is usually complicated and indirect because of the high nonlinearity of parametric spline functions. Therefore, an interpolation algorithm based on Taylor’s expansion is developed in this study to correlate the preplanned <b>walking</b> path with <b>a</b> desired linear velocity. When the desired linear velocity is set as <b>a</b> uniform <b>walking</b> velocity command, the robotic walking support system can guide <b>a</b> user <b>walking</b> along <b>a</b> preplanned <b>walking</b> path at uniform walking velocity. Furthermore, for the robotic walking support system to be able to guide the user at user-adjustable walking velocity, the concept of admittance motion control is employed to correlate the desired linear velocity with the force exerted by the user. Several experiments are conducted using a robotic cane that was developed in this study, and the experimental results show the validity of the proposed approaches.

After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour.

The LIRR would be rebuilt, grade-separated, and electrified. The Richmond Hill station would be renovated for additional LIRR service, while the Hollis and Queens Village stations would be converted from side platform stations to island platform configurations. This $488 million option, {{to be completed by}} 1995, was also opposed by people living along the Montauk Branch.|$|E

50|$|For <b>a</b> neutral <b>walking</b> {{motion that}} is neither (or equally) happy or sad, the {{corresponding}} {{degrees of freedom}} for the existing motions are used for interpolation. As a result, a tuple of degrees of freedom is created for <b>a</b> simulated figure <b>walking</b> <b>a</b> neutral <b>walking</b> motion at <b>a</b> generic time.Alternatively, if {{the mood of the}} simulated figure were to change in real time from happy to sad, the interpolation would be more influenced by the happy walking motion {{at the start of the}} transition. Towards the end of the transition, the interpolation would be more influenced by the sad walking motion until the figure simply walks the sad walking motion.|$|R

5|$|The {{following}} campaign, Edler {{improved to}} career-highs of 37 assists, first among team defensemen, and 42 points, second to Christian Ehrhoff.
