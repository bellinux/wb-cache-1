25|$|In Series 9, Capaldi {{described}} his character as a 'thrill-seeker' who is confronting danger where he soon realises {{that he is}} 'one of the luckiest creatures in all of time and space' and that 'life is short even at two-thousand years'. According to Coleman regarding Clara's bond with The Doctor inquring if she had feelings for him she stated “She’s totally in love with him, always has been. It’s its own kind of love. He is her hero but she would be very reluctant to tell him that. It’s a doctor-and-companion love, and there’s nothing else like it really.” “They’re kind of freed of their issues and in <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>place</b> together. Previously {{she was trying to}} keep him under control yet now the two of them are going ‘Come on, lets jump, lets do it’, egging each other on really, and being more and more reckless,” she teased. Capaldi stated “It’s sort of an utterly platonic bond, which is quite unusual. The problem is the Doctor knows a lot more than he ever says. He knows Clara’s fate. He knows the fate of all his companions before they do.” Ultimately it has been confirmed by both Capaldi and Coleman that the Doctor and Clara's relationship is romantic in nature.|$|E
500|$|Coward's {{political}} views were conservative, but not unswervingly so: he despised {{the government of}} Neville Chamberlain for its policy of appeasing Nazi Germany, and he differed sharply with Winston Churchill over the abdication crisis of 1936. Whereas Churchill supported Edward VIII's wish to marry [...] "his cutie", Wallis Simpson, Coward thought the king irresponsible, telling Churchill, [...] "England doesn't wish for a Queen Cutie." [...] Coward disliked propaganda in plays; [...] "The theatre is <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>place,</b> a house of strange enchantment, a temple of illusion. What it most emphatically is not {{and never will be}} is a scruffy, ill-lit, fumed-oak drill hall serving as a temporary soap box for political propaganda." [...] Nevertheless, his own views sometimes surfaced in his plays: both Cavalcade and This Happy Breed are, {{in the words of the}} playwright David Edgar, [...] "overtly Conservative political plays written in the Brechtian epic manner." [...] In religion, Coward was agnostic. He wrote of his views, [...] "Do I believe in God? I can't say No and I can't say Yes, To me it's anybody's guess." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Wind, Whales and Whisky, Silver Donald Cameron {{discusses}} one of {{the ironies}} he sees about life in Cape Breton.
