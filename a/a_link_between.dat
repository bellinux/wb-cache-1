5|$|The Legend of Zelda: <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> <b>Between</b> Worlds is an action-adventure game {{presented}} in stereoscopic 3D polygonal graphics, with gameplay predominantly experienced from a top-down perspective. Players control {{a young boy}} named Link, who embarks on an adventure to rescue the Seven Sages and defeat Yuga, the game's primary antagonist. The game is set in two kingdoms—Hyrule and Lorule—both of which bear an open world structure and similar layout, but contrast in style and tone. <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> <b>Between</b> Worlds {{is seen as a}} successor to the 1991 Super Nintendo Entertainment System title , and is similar in many aspects. The worlds of Hyrule and Lorule in <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> <b>Between</b> Worlds are analogous to A Link to the Pasts depiction of Hyrule and the Dark World. A number of items, enemies, and audio tracks featured in A Link to the Past return in <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> <b>Between</b> Worlds.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Link</b> <b>Between</b> Worlds {{features}} original music {{along with}} tracks from A Link to the Past. Ryo Nagamatsu composed and orchestrated new music for <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> <b>Between</b> Worlds, {{and played the}} flute music featured in the game's milk bar. He also composed arrangements and adapted Koji Kondo's original music from A Link to the Past. Nagamatsu wanted to balance arrangements of past music with completely new music to please both old and new players. He began by revisiting old tracks and thinking how he could best adapt them for <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> <b>Between</b> Worlds soundtrack. He was eager to include choral performances {{as a way to}} add tension to the eerie and unpleasant scenes in the game. Nagamatsu performed the vocals and made use of multitrack recording to layer the different vocals tracks. The audio team decided not use a live orchestra for recording the game's music, the primary reason for this was to create optimal sound for the Nintendo 3DS. The reverberations and low-pitch sounds created by a live orchestra were not suitable for the Nintendo 3DS speakers. The majority of the string music was created using a synthesizer, with Toru Minegishi playing guitar on one track.|$|E

A 1999 study in 572 women taking warfarin for deep venous thrombosis, risk of vertebral fracture and rib fracture was increased; other fracture types did not occur more commonly. A 2002 study looking at a randomly selected selection of 1523 patients with osteoporotic fracture found no increased exposure to anticoagulants compared to controls, and neither did stratification of the duration of anticoagulation reveal a trend towards fracture.|$|E
5|$|Also in {{the early}} 1980s, several studies {{suggested}} <b>a</b> <b>link</b> <b>between</b> children's consumption of aspirin and Reye's syndrome, a potentially fatal disease. By 1986, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration required warning labels on all aspirin, further suppressing sales. The makers of Tylenol also {{filed a lawsuit against}} Anacin aspirin maker American Home Products, claiming that the failure to add warning labels before 1986 had unfairly held back Tylenol sales, though this suit was eventually dismissed.|$|E

5|$|China's {{rail system}} had long {{linked to the}} Trans-Siberian via northeastern China and Mongolia. In 1990 China added <b>a</b> <b>link</b> <b>between</b> its rail system and the Trans-Siberian via Kazakhstan. China calls its {{uninterrupted}} rail link between {{the port city of}} Lianyungang and Kazakhstan the New Eurasian Land Bridge or Second Eurasian Continental Bridge. In addition to Kazakhstan, the railways connect with other countries in Central Asia and the Middle East, including Iran. With the October 2013 completion of the rail link across the Bosphorus under the Marmaray project the New Eurasian Land Bridge now theoretically connects to Europe via Central and South Asia.|$|E
5|$|Dendritic cells (DC) are phagocytes in tissues {{that are}} {{in contact with the}} {{external}} environment; therefore, they are located mainly in the skin, nose, lungs, stomach, and intestines. They are named for their resemblance to neuronal dendrites, as both have many spine-like projections, but dendritic cells are in no way connected to the nervous system. Dendritic cells serve as <b>a</b> <b>link</b> <b>between</b> the bodily tissues and the innate and adaptive immune systems, as they present antigens to T cells, one of the key cell types of the adaptive immune system.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{matching}} mitochondrial DNA, geneticist Turi King continued to pursue <b>a</b> <b>link</b> <b>between</b> the paternally-inherited Y-DNA {{and that of}} descendants of John of Gaunt. Four living male-line descendants of Gaunt have been located, and their results are a match to each other. The Y-DNA from the skeleton is somewhat degraded, but proved not to match any of the living male-line relatives, showing that a false-paternity event had happened somewhere in the 19 generations between Richard III and Henry Somerset, 5th Duke of Beaufort; work by Turi King and others has shown that historical rates of false paternity are around 1–2% per generation.|$|E
