Before the dancing, our {{problems}} were really heavy to bear. Dancing takes our minds <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> problems. Our bodies became more healthy. As for the judges, they may be impressed with us, seeing that we are being rehabilitated and this could help our case. We are being rehabilitated in a good way.|$|E
5|$|American {{astronomer}} Edwin Hubble {{observed that}} the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their redshifts. This was interpreted to mean that all distant galaxies and clusters are receding <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance: that is, the farther they are, the faster they move away from us, regardless of direction. Assuming the Copernican principle (that the Earth is not {{the center of the}} universe), the only remaining interpretation is that all observable regions of the universe are receding from all others. Since we know that the distance between galaxies increases today, it must mean that in the past galaxies were closer together. The continuous expansion of the universe implies that the universe was denser and hotter in the past.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{our current}} {{knowledge}} was gained during the 20th century. With {{the help of the}} use of photography, fainter objects were observed. Our sun was found {{to be part of a}} galaxy made up of more than 1010 stars (10 billion stars). The existence of other galaxies, one of the matters of the great debate, was settled by Edwin Hubble, who identified the Andromeda nebula as a different galaxy, and many others at large distances and receding, moving <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> galaxy.|$|E

NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope has revealed the first known system of seven Earth-size planets around a single star. Three of these planets are firmly located in the habitable zone, {{the area around the}} parent star where a rocky planet is most likely to have liquid water. The discovery sets a new record for greatest number of habitable-zone planets found around a single star outside our solar system. All of these seven planets could have liquid water – key to {{life as we know it}} – under the right atmospheric conditions, but the chances are highest with the three in the habitable zone.|$|E

500|$|Like Crazy {{was filmed}} over four weeks—the first three in Los Angeles {{and the last}} in London. The {{production}} budget was $250,000, which included the cost of airfares for the cast and crew. The film was shot on a Canon EOS 7D still camera with cinema lenses, mounted on a rig constructed by cinematographer John Guleserian. He chose the 7D for its portability and the ease it provided for shooting improvised scenes, where he found other cameras too cumbersome. Guleserian said {{that many of the}} film's scenes were shot [...] "really far <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> characters [...] really tight close ups" [...] due to the technological limitations of the camera, but he noted that this added to the tone of the film.|$|E
500|$|After {{the first}} fatality, {{newspaper}} cartoonists began using sharks as caricatures for political figures, German U-boats, Victorian morality and fashion, polio, and the deadly heat wave threatening the Northeast. Fernicola notes, [...] "Since 1916 {{was among the}} years that Americans were trying {{to break away from}} the rigidity and conservatism of the Victorian period, one comic depicted a risqué polka-dot bathing suit and advertised it as the secret weapon to keep sharks <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> swimmers." [...] Another cartoon depicted [...] "an exasperated individual {{at the end of a}} dock that displays a 'Danger: No Swimming' sign and mentions the three most emphasized 'danger' topics of the day: 'Infantile Paralysis (polio), Epidemic Heat Wave, and Sharks in the Ocean'." [...] The cartoon is entitled [...] "What's a Family Man to Do?" [...] With America's growing distrust of Germany in 1916, cartoonists depicted U-boats with the mouth and fins of a shark assaulting Uncle Sam while he wades in the water.|$|E
500|$|After {{the third}} {{international}} break, Benfica returned on 18 November with a match {{on the road}} against Braga. Quim had a particularly unfortunate game, making costly mistakes in two goals, and Benfica lost the match 3–1. Santos acknowledged his team's disappointing performance, saying, [...] "We never controlled the game, despite having opportunities to even up. We had some reasonable moments but far <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> best." [...] On the following Tuesday, Benfica played Copenhagen in Estádio da Luz for the fifth match-day of the group stage. Benfica scored three goals in the first half, two of them spaced by two minutes and winning the match 3–1. After news of Celtic's win against United, Benfica would only progress to the last 16 if they won at Old Trafford, which Santos believed to be possible. On the 25th, Benfica hosted Marítimo. Benfica scored first with an own-goal from Alex von Schwedler, but Marítimo levelled the score before half time through Marcinho. In the second half, Katsouranis scored the second Benfica goal, establishing the final result at 2–1 to Benfica. Santos criticized his players for [...] "excessive individualism".|$|E

500|$|In 1929, at {{the second}} UAHC convention, Witt had {{asserted}} that America [...] "by its very pleasantness and friendliness lures us <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> ancient loyalties. Its secularism is so delightful, its mutuality so penetrative, its universalism so delightful, that by a sort of sheer spiritual osmosis it incorporates us into itself and makes us look and {{become more and more}} like itself". Witt argued that Jews had to resist this pull. Ten years later, however, in a 1939 article in The Christian Century, he argued that Jews should celebrate Christmas. In his view, Christians were now more liberal and celebrated [...] "the inherent humanness and universalism" [...] of Christmas, rather than any specifically Christian doctrine. Stating that his children had been deprived of the holiday's pleasures, Witt asserted that Judaism was already a syncretic religion, and that celebrating the holiday was an ecumenical act which did not indicate that he was [...] "thereby drawn even by the breadth of a hair nearer to the worship of an ecclesiastical Christ". He concluded by asking [...] "Is it neither treason of Jew nor triumph of Christian but partnership of Jew and Christian in the making of a better world in which the Christ can have part only by energizing and perpetuating and hallowing the partnership?" ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers have {{identified}} multiple themes and literary {{elements in the}} manga. According to Mania Entertainment's Nadia Oxford, Mihara uses minimal dialogue and narrative, instead conveying emotion through {{the behavior of the}} characters. IGN's A.E. Sparrow stated that the theme of the stories was the meaning of humanity, while Oxford wrote that the manga contains [...] "themes of dystopian society and the fragile nature of the human mind." [...] Sparrow thought that mental instability figures prominently in the stories. According to him, [...] "Keep Those Condoms <b>Away</b> <b>From</b> <b>Our</b> Kids" [...] deals with [...] "the nature of sex," [...] while Oxford believed that the story raises the question of the declining birth rate of Japan and other developed countries. Jason Thompson, author of , considered [...] "The Sunflower Quality of an Integrated Circuit" [...] to have elements from film noir. By featuring a mute mermaid in [...] "Fish Out Of Water", Mihara makes an implicit reference to the fairytale [...] "The Little Mermaid", according to Oxford. The treatment of the elderly, children, or the unborn is the focus of some of the stories, according to Sparrow. Sparrow and Dan Grendall of Ain't It Cool News speculated that [...] "Alive" [...] focuses on the meaning of living.|$|E
500|$|The cathedral {{is widely}} {{considered}} a masterpiece of Armenian architecture. It is {{the largest and most}} impressive structure of Ani, and has been described by Armen Kazaryan as the most significant structure of the entire Bagratid period. The cathedral is known for its novel design features. Authors of Global History of Architecture wrote that it [...] "deserves to be listed among the principal monuments of the time because of its pointed arches and clustered columns and piers." [...] Josef Strzygowski argued that the cathedral is the most valuable achievement of Armenian architecture from the European viewpoint. David Marshall Lang wrote that the cathedral's building techniques are [...] "far ahead of the contemporary Anglo-Saxon and Norman architecture of western Europe." [...] H. F. B. Lynch wrote: [...] "The impression which we take <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> survey of these various features is that we have been introduced to a monument of the highest artistic merit, denoting a standard of culture which was far in advance of the contemporary standards in the West." [...] Sirarpie Der Nersessian wrote that it [...] "deserves to be listed among the important examples of medieval architecture." [...] The New International Encyclopedia characterized it as the [...] "most interesting church of Armenia." [...] David Roden Buxton suggested that the cathedral deserves far more fame than it actually has. Richard Phené Spiers wrote in the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition (1911): ...|$|E
