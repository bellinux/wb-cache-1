500|$|Removing and {{disposing}} of the ash was a monumental task for some Eastern Washington communities. State {{and federal agencies}} estimated that over [...] of ash, equivalent to about 900,000 tons in weight, were removed from highways and airports in Washington. The <b>ash</b> <b>removal</b> cost $2.2 million and took 10 weeks in Yakima. The need to remove ash quickly from transport routes and civil works dictated the selection of some disposal sites. Some cities used old quarries and existing sanitary landfills; others created dump sites wherever expedient. To minimize wind reworking of ash dumps, the surfaces of some disposal sites were covered with topsoil and seeded with grass. In Portland, the mayor eventually threatened businesses with fines if they failed to remove the ash from their parking lots.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reciprocating}} mechanism on {{the driving}} wheels of a two-cylinder single expansion steam locomotive tended to pound the rails (see hammer blow), thus requiring more maintenance. Raising steam from coal took {{a matter of}} hours, and created serious pollution problems. Coal-burning locomotives required fire cleaning and <b>ash</b> <b>removal</b> between turns of duty. Diesel or electric locomotives, by comparison, drew benefit from new custom-built servicing facilities. The smoke from steam locomotives was also deemed objectionable; [...] the first electric and diesel locomotives were developed in response to smoke abatement requirements, although this did {{not take into account}} the high level of less-visible pollution in diesel exhaust smoke, especially when idling. In some countries, however, power for electric locomotives is derived from steam generated in power stations, which are often run by coal.|$|E
2500|$|The dumps {{drew the}} ire of local residents, due to strong odors and being deemed unsightly, along with {{increasing}} rat infestations in the local neighborhoods. Much of the [...] "street sweepings" [...] collected consisted of horse manure from horse-drawn carriages. In addition, many residents simply threw out normal garbage along with the coal ashes. The meadows were also {{considered one of the}} worst breeding grounds for mosquitoes in the city. The dump was famously characterized as [...] "a valley of ashes" [...] in F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. Fitzgerald meanwhile described the Flushing River, now polluted from the dumps, as [...] "a small foul river". The dumps and garbage trains were accused of facilitating a Polio outbreak in Corona in 1916. The Brooklyn <b>Ash</b> <b>Removal</b> Company was brought to court by local residents in 1923 for [...] "violation of the sanitary code" [...] due to the smoke emitted from the dumps. As a minor concession, the company opened the Corona Park Golf and Country Club in 1931, on a tract near Nassau Boulevard (today's Long Island Expressway).|$|E

2500|$|New York City Parks Commissioner Robert Moses first {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} developing a large park in Flushing Meadow in the 1920s. At the time, he envisioned the site to become a [...] "true 'Central Park'", especially with much of city population moving to Queens and Long Island due to urban sprawl. Moses also planned Flushing Meadows to be the westernmost of a chain of parks running across Queens, including Kissena Park, Cunningham Park, Alley Pond Park, and Douglaston Park. In 1929, representatives from surrounding communities created a plan to turn the ash dump into a recreational complex, and presented them to Queens Borough President George U. Harvey. In 1930, Moses released plans for numerous parks and highways in the city. This included the Grand Central Parkway, the construction of which would require taking land from the ash dumps. One of the provisional projects listed was a Flushing River Park, along with a [...] "Flushing River Parkway". The Brooklyn <b>Ash</b> <b>Removal</b> Company's contract with the city expired in 1933, and the city took over the company's assets and operations on May 25, 1934. The Brooklyn Ash property occupied around 300 acres of the 1000 acre site, north {{of what is now}} the Long Island Expressway. The remainder of the meadows still contained natural wildlife. It was frequented by fur trappers, local residents collecting firewood and growing vegetables, and later squattors during the Great Depression. Areas of the dumps were also used for growing vegetables, with the soil fertilized by the garbage and manure.|$|E
2500|$|Around 1907, {{contractor}} Michael Degnon, whose firm {{constructed the}} Williamsburg Bridge, the Cape Cod Canal, and the Steinway subway tunnel (used by today's [...] ), purchased {{large tracts of}} marsh near Flushing Creek. At the time, the land was considered [...] "all but worthless". Degnon envisioned using the site to create a large industrial port around Flushing Bay, similar to a terminal he developed in Long Island City. By 1911, Degnon had created a plan along with the United States Department of War and the Queens Topographical Bureau. The plan envisioned widening Flushing River and creating docks for ships, with numerous factories and freight facilities. Meanwhile, the residential areas of Corona were expected to become the primary residence for factory workers.To create the port, beginning in 1910 Degnon proceeded to fill the land using household coal refuse ashes and street sweepings from Brooklyn. Degnon set up two companies of his own, {{one of which was}} contracted with the New York City Department of Sanitation. He also contracted the Brooklyn <b>Ash</b> <b>Removal</b> Company, owned {{by a member of the}} corrupt Tammany Hall political machine. Residential ash was collected via trolleys of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company, and loaded onto freight trains which traveled via the Long Island Rail Road branches, or other trolleys, which hauled the refuse to Corona. The operation was referred to as a citywide refuse [...] "conveyor belt", while the trains were nicknamed the [...] "Talcum Powder Express" [...] because they often ran uncovered and deposited soot onto the surroundings. The northern end of the site was filled via now-conventional means, using dirt pumped from Flushing Bay which was being dredged to a lower depth. Material from the bay was extracted by an offshore hydraulic machine, and funneled through a [...] pipe across Northern Boulevard, before being deposited onto the wetlands. The filling for the north meadow was complete in 1916.|$|E

We estimate the discounted cost of <b>ash</b> treatment, <b>removal,</b> and replacement on developed land within communities in a 25 -state study area centered on Detroit using simulations of EAB spread and infestation over the next decade (2009 - 2019). An estimated 38 Â million ash trees occur on this land base. The simulations predict an expanding EAB infestation that will likely encompass most of the 25 states and warrant treatment, removal, and replacement of more than 17 Â million ash trees with mean discounted cost of $ 10. 7 Â billion. Expanding the land base to include developed land outside, as well as inside, communities nearly double the {{estimates of the number of}} ash trees treated or removed and replaced, and the associated cost.

The treated fly ash was tested for adsorption of heavy metal ions and dyes in aqueous solution. It was shown that fly ash and the modified forms could effectively absorb heavy metals and methylene blue but not effectively adsorb rhodamine B. Modifying fly ash with NaOH solution would significantly enhance the adsorption capacity depending on the treatment temperature, time, and base concentration. The adsorption capacity of methylene blue would increases with pH of the dye solution and the sorption capacity of FA-NaOH could reach 5 x 10 (- 5) mol/g. The adsorption isotherm could be described by the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm equations. Removal of copper and nickel ions could also be achieved on those treated fly <b>ash.</b> The <b>removal</b> efficiency for copper and nickel ions could be from 30 % to 90 % depending on the initial concentrations.
