40|$|The <b>automatic</b> <b>amplitude</b> <b>control</b> (AAC) loop is an {{indispensable}} element for the practical realization of VCOs {{embedded in a}} complete transceiver. Its noise however can unacceptably degrade the single-sideband-to-carrier ratio (SSCR) performance of the oscillator, this problem being even exacerbated in low-voltage circuits. This paper addresses the design issues of a low-voltage low-noise differential LC-VCO with AAC, tunable within a 2. 3 - 2. 8 -GHz frequency range, fully integrated in bipolar technology with 2 -V power supply. First, the mechanisms through which the AAC noise affects the output phase are identified as the poor indirect stability and the AM-to-PM conversion due to the varactors. The effect of the AAC noise is discussed and substantially reduced with suitable design choices. We show that the achievable noise-to-signal ratio is bounded by the shot noise coming from the bias source of the differential oscillator, an intrinsic limit set by the low supply voltage which {{does not allow for}} degeneration of the tail transistor. Second, the design of the AAC is discussed. A large gain-bandwidth product (GBWP), about 100 MHz, has been implemented in order to correct for the fast oscillation amplitude variations and reduce the effect of the ground line disturbances. The expected value of the phase noise level, SSCR at 100 kHz =- 104 dBc/Hz, is tightly matched by the experimental results. The core oscillator dissipates 7 mA, while less than 600 μA are drawn by the AAC circuit...|$|E

40|$|The Primary {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to increase geologic and tectonic understanding of the geothermal resources at the Naval Air Station (NAS) Fallon, Nevada. The seismic reflection method is employed to study faults, fractures and other tectonic structures in the subsurface in order to identify geothermal drill targets. The efficiency of geothermal systems is strongly dependent on water circulation. Discrete faults may be permeable and provide pathways for water flow depending on the fracture density. It is therefore desirable to detect and map faults and fracture zones and characterize their physical properties when evaluating a geothermal prospect. ^ The seismic data for this project were provided by the NAS environmental research program in Ridgecrest, CA. However, the data collection information was not available so the work includes determining the line geometry and mapping shot points to field files in order to process the data. ProMAX 2 D™ is the software used to determine the geometry and to process the data.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Strain <b>amplitude</b> <b>control</b> is {{most often}} {{employed}} when carrying out fatigue testing of rubber components. Often the design engineer requires fatigue test data {{that is based on}} load <b>amplitude</b> <b>control.</b> This is analogous to engineering or nominal stress <b>amplitude</b> <b>control.</b> This usually makes it easy to maintain the load within the specified test limits during extended testing. Values of true stress and strain can be obtained from this approach, but the magnitudes of the maximum true stresses in these tests increase with accumulated cycles, whereas the equivalent maximum engineering stress values remain constant. This is easily demonstrated in the uniaxial case; however the nature of the applied load in equi-biaxial testing adds complexity. The effect in the equi-biaxial case is amplified as the principal stretch ratios have a more pronounced influence on both true stress and strain than in the uniaxial case. Engineering stress-strain data is particularly useful when representing the fatigue behaviour of elastic materials; however it does not represent reality in the case of rubber samples subjected to repeated high strains. True stress control testing can provide data to verify viscoelastic models used to describe elastomeric behaviour under bi-axial fatigue conditions. A test programme has been devised to examine the effect on fatigue life and stress strain relationships of a material tested under conditions of maximum biaxial true stress.
