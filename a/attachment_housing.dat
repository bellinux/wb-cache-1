40|$|The {{role and}} extent of sexual {{orientation}} discrimination {{is the focus of}} a growing body of literature in economics and in other social sciences, across a wide range of social domains. This work aims at providing a holistic approach to the assessment of lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people's life experience by developing a synthetic index of social inclusion. This is obtained by aggregating several variables pertaining to the following domains: monetary poverty, labour market <b>attachment,</b> <b>housing</b> conditions, subjective well-being, and education. We focus on the case of Italy due to the availability of a peculiar dataset that allows us to distinguish LGB people who are open about their sexuality and those who choose not to declare it. The empirical analysis highlights a lower level of inclusion of individuals in same-sex couples that cannot be explained by other observable characteristics. Thus, it may denote a lack of equal opportunities and a need for adequate inclusion policies. Being publicly open about one's sexuality is found as a crucial correlate of the welfare of LGB people, to an extent so far neglected by the literature. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc...|$|E
40|$|Older adults’ housing {{decisions}} {{in later life}} are significant and complex. An older person’s home can form {{a central part of}} their life, and has been shown to impact on health and wellbeing, and be connected to identity and sense of <b>attachment.</b> <b>Housing</b> decisions are complicated by the many factors requiring consideration, the reality that ageing is often accompanied by changes in health and physical ability, and the process being individualised to each person’s unique life circumstances. Past literature, modelling the influencing factors on older adults’ housing decisions, has assumed that decision-making has a clearly definable pathway and is both conscious and rational. These assumptions have been criticised, along with these models being deemed overly simplistic, by critics who call for an alternative approach to expand the understanding of housing decision-making. In response to this, the present study aimed to explore the social location of older New Zealanders’ housing decisions by examining the socially available discursive resources that older adults draw on to construct their housing choices. Interviews were conducted in the homes of five individuals and two couples, aged over 65 years, who resided in a range of different housing situations. The interviews were audio recorded, typed verbatim and discursively analysed as guided by the phases outlined by Potter and Wetherell (1987). Five main interpretative repertoires used to talk about housing choices were identified, labelled ‘Decline’, ‘Medical’, ‘Independence’, ‘Stability’ and ‘Familial’, along with the subject positions provided by each of these discursive resources. There were a number of interactions between the repertoires that showed participants shifting back and forth between using the different repertoires, which provided a more nuanced understanding of how they constructed their housing decisions. The identified discursive resources came from outside of what is most commonly thought of as housing-related variables, demonstrating that these decisions are constructed using broader social resources. The study has implications for broadening the theoretical lens on the understanding of older adults’ housing decisions, along with implications for housing decision-making and informing housing, health and ageing policies. Overall, the social location of participants’ housing decisions highlighted that they are not fixed, causal, linear processes, but instead complex and dynamic, and located in people’s broader social lives...|$|E
40|$|This work {{explores the}} role of {{discrimination}} in shaping individuals’ lives and opportunities, with specific respect to sexual orientation. The role of sexual orientation in explaining earning differences has been increasingly emphasized in empirical literature on discrimination mainly {{as a result of}} the growing availability of data sources on gays and lesbian populations. Available evidence predominantly converges on the one hand on the identification of discrimination treatments for gays and positive wage differential for lesbian women with respect to heterosexual counterparts. On the other hand, disagreement pervades interpretations of the predominant above-described labour market outcome. In trying to move beyond such conflicting views, we consider a holistic approach to social exclusion, defined as individuals’ ability to fully participate to social life by examining five domains: monetary poverty, labour market <b>attachment,</b> <b>housing</b> conditions, subjective well-being, and education. Three samples of different waves of the Banca d’Italia “Survey on household income and wealth” (SHIW - 2006, 2008 and 2010) were pooled in order to perform the empirical analysis on a reasonably sized sample of heterosexual couples identified according to a cohabitation criteria. Following the SHIW characteristics and definition of household, we are able to differentiate homosexual couples belonging to a sub-population of out same-sex couples from those who are not openly out about their homosexual relationship. We develop an understanding of social exclusion as a non-dichotomous concept (that is, one is not necessarily “included” or “excluded”, but a continuum of intermediate conditions exist) through fuzzy analysis techniques and develop a synthetic index of inclusion/exclusion as well as a number of partial indexes, composed of several variables pertaining to a certain domain. Overall indicators of social exclusion are examined for the full sample and for the sub-sample of workers only, comparing individuals cohabiting in same-sex couples with heterosexual counterparts. Our results point out that a significant and non-negligible portion of the social exclusion suffered by lesbian and gay couples cannot be accounted for by observable factors and may therefore be attributed to the impact of discrimination. Coherently with the existing literature, we find a differentiated impact on gay men and lesbian couples. However, and possibly more relevantly, we also find significant differences between the couples of “out” homosexual individuals and those composed of “closeted” individuals. ...|$|E

40|$|Place {{attachment}} {{refers to}} the process of human-place bonding; the bonding process includes both physical and social ties formed within an environment. In the last two decades, place attachment {{has been the subject of}} many studies, but there have not been many cross-cultural studies. The aim of this study was to determine differences in global <b>attachment</b> to <b>house,</b> neighbourhood and city among young people in Belgrade and Helsinki, with consideration of social and physical dimensions of place attachment. Additionally, the effects of gender on all types of place attachments were tested. Data were collected using the Place Attachment Scale (Hidalgo & Hernandez, 2001) and the Questionnaire on residential and socio-demographic characteristics of the sample. The instrument was translated into Serbian and Finnish, respecting the translation procedure for cross-cultural studies (Brislin, 1986) and administered to subjects in their native language. The study was conducted on the sample of two hundred students of psychology, comprising: 100 inhabitants of Belgrade, and 100 of Helsinki, balanced by gender (60 % female, 40 % male) and age (average 24. 4 years). The following results can be pointed out: 1) young people living in Belgrade show greater degree of global attachment to their city than young people living in Helsinki to their city, 2) young people from Belgrade also show greater social ties within their city and house, in relation to peers from Helsinki, 3) physical <b>attachment</b> to <b>house</b> and city is also significantly higher in young inhabitants of Belgrade. An interesting finding is 4) the existence of significant differences between men and women in the degree of global, social and physical <b>attachment</b> to <b>house</b> and physical <b>attachment</b> to city in the Serbian sample, and non-existence of differences in place attachment between men and women in the Finnish sample.

40|$|As the β-catenin pathway {{has been}} shown to be {{involved}} in mechanotransduction, we sought to determine if haploinsufficiency would affect skeletal response to unloading. It has previously been shown that deletion of both alleles of β-catenin in bone cells results in a fragile skeleton highly susceptible to fracture, but deletion of one allele using Dmp 1 -Cre (Ctnnb 1 +/loxP; Dmp 1 -Cre, cKO HET) has little effect on the 2 mo old skeleton. We found that under normal housing conditions, trabecular bone volume was significantly less in 5 mo old male cKO HET mice compared to controls (Ctrl/HET:Tb. BV/TV = 13. 96 ± 2. 71 / 8. 92 ± 0. 95 %, Tb. N. = 4. 88 ± 0. 51 / 3. 95 ± 0. 44 /mm, Tb. Sp. = 0. 20 ± 0. 02 / 0. 26 ± 0. 03 mm, a 36 %, 19 % and 30 % change respectively) but not in females suggesting an age and gender related effect. Before performing suspension experiments and to control for the environmental effects, animals with the same tail <b>attachment</b> and <b>housing</b> conditions, but not suspended (NS), were compared to normally <b>housed</b> (NH) animals. <b>Attachment</b> and <b>housing</b> resulted in weight loss in both genders and phenotypes. Cortical bone loss was observed in the cKO HET males (NH/NS, Ct BV/TV: 90. 45 ± 0. 72 / 89. 12 ± 0. 56 %) and both diaphyseal (0. 19 ± 0. 01 / 0. 17 ± 0. 01 mm) and metaphyseal (0. 10 ± 0. 01 / 0. 08 ± 0. 01 mm) thickness, but not in female cKO HET mice suggesting that male cKO HET mice are susceptible to <b>attachment</b> and <b>housing</b> conditions. These results with transgenic mice emphasizes the importance of proper controls when attributing skeletal responses to unloading. With suspension, cKO HET male mice did not lose bone unlike female cKO HET mice that had greater trabecular bone loss than controls (Ctrl 9 %:cKO HET 21 % decrease Tb. N; Ctrl 12 %:cKO HET 27 % increase Tb. Sp.). Suspended and non-suspended mice lost weight compared to normally housed animals.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the major pull factors on residents' {{attachment}} to their own housing community. This examination will lead to better understanding of consumer behavior in the housing market. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected through a questionnaire survey and examination of the data was conducted by the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), which was supplemented by multiple regression analysis. Findings - It was found that two major factors determine community <b>attachment</b> and hence <b>housing</b> choice. Safety of community determines residents' attachment to their own housing community. Sense of belonging affects residents' willingness to stay. It implies that residents do have strong perception of what the image of their own community is like, and positive management of community can enhance such image and therefore the sense of belonging. Research limitations/implications - The database used is relatively small. Originality/value - Neighborhood attachment has been well-researched, but not much has been done in Hong Kong where most housing communities are high rise-high density. An understanding of the factors pulling residents' <b>attachment</b> towards certain <b>housing</b> community will provide more insight into housing choice decision making. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Because molecular diagnostic methods are generally rather difficult to perform manually without highly trained users, automated and integrated systems are highly desirable but too costly for use at point-of-care or low-resource settings. Here, we showcase {{the development of a}} low-cost and rapid nucleic acid isolation and amplification platform by modifying entry-level 3 D printers that cost between $ 400 and $ 750. Our modifications consisted of replacing the extruder with a tip-comb <b>attachment</b> that <b>houses</b> magnets to conduct magnetic particle-based nucleic acid extraction. We then programmed the 3 D printer to conduct motions that can perform high-quality extraction protocols. Up to 12 samples can be processed simultaneously in under 13 minutes and the efficiency of nucleic acid isolation matches well against gold-standard spin-column-based extraction technology. Additionally, we used the 3 D printer's heated bed to supply heat to perform water bath-based polymerase chain reactions (PCRs). Using another attachment to hold PCR tubes, the 3 D printer was programmed to automate the process of shuttling PCR tubes between water baths. By eliminating the temperature ramping needed in most commercial thermal cyclers, the run time of a 35 -cycle PCR protocol was shortened by 33 %. This article demonstrates that for applications in resource-limited settings, expensive nucleic acid extraction devices and thermal cyclers that are used in many central laboratories can be potentially replaced by a device modified from inexpensive entry-level 3 D printers...|$|R

40|$|With the {{deepening}} of housing reform, housing mobility in urban China {{is on the}} rise. Extant studies on relocation satisfaction and relocation intention pay much attention on rural to urban relocation. Yet {{little is known about}} intra-urban relocation in Chinese cities. This study attempts to fill this void by offering an updated and nuanced analysis of intra-urban relocation and unraveling the complex mechanism and outcomes of residential mobility in post-reform urban China. Based on a questionnaire survey in three types of neighborhoods representative of the dominant residential patterns in contemporary Chinese cities, namely traditional inner city neighborhood, urban villages and commodity housing estates, this paper examines the determinants of relocation satisfaction and relocation intention of local residents. Results from linear regression and multivariate logistic regression models show that relocation satisfaction in the three types of residential neighborhoods are influenced by different factors, but generally shaped by community <b>attachment</b> and <b>housing</b> facilities; meanwhile, residential satisfaction is negatively associated with residential time, while positively related to the average cost of housing management. Relocation intention is generated by a combined effect of various factors, and varies in different residential neighborhoods. In traditional inner city neighborhoods, residents are less likely to develop relocation intention, and their satisfaction level goes down with the age of the housing estates. The situation is slightly different in urban villages, where residents with weak sense of community prefer to relocate. The diversified determinants of relocation intention in the three types of neighborhood are by no means sporadic. They are in fact closely related to the demographic composition, build environment, and development history of the neighborhood. This study offers a multilayer explanation to existing understanding of intra-urban relocation which tends to provide singular explanation either concentrating on socioeconomic indicators or neighborhood sentiments, or life course...|$|R
