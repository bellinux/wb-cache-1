40|$|AbstractDuring {{four months}} in the winter period of 2002 – 2003, a census of four species of hoofed animals (red deer, sika deer, roe deer, and musk deer) was {{conducted}} in the study areas of the Sikhote-Alin Reserve and the surrounding area, including {{the territory of the}} planned Reserve Tavayza. The census was conducted on a monthly basis at two sites in the pine and broadleaved forest (nature Reserve and surrounding area) and at three sites in the oak and broadleaved forest. A total of 40 counts were made. Five fieldworkers were working at each site for two days. During the first day, the fieldworkers counted daily hoof prints and removed them. During the second day, newly appearing hoof prints were counted. In addition to the usual counting of crossings of hoofed animals, the number of individual animals was counted, as well. Thus, the census was conducted by two methods: counting of hoof prints in the tracks and counting of individual animals in a certain area. The results of these surveys were organized into a database which shows the relative density of hoofed <b>animals</b> (<b>number</b> of crossings of hoof prints per 10 km of the route) and absolute density of hoofed <b>animals</b> (<b>number</b> of individuals per km 2).

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that climatic variation has the effect on the dynamics of arid and semi-arid grazing systems of reducing <b>animal</b> <b>numbers</b> below the level at which they have much impact on vegetation or soils, and that spatial heterogeneity in resource availability serves to buffer herbivores against climatic variation. Modelling was used to test these hypotheses and to examine the interacting effects of temporal and spatial variability in plant production on animal population dynamics and defoliation intensity. The model distinguishes areas of the range that are accessible during wet and dry seasons, and examines the effect of seasonal restrictions in foraging area. It was established that the animal population is in long-term equi-librium with dry-season resources, on which it depends for survival; that dry season resource areas and outlying areas thus operate in a source-sink manner; and that the ratio of these areas determines the strength of consumer-resource coupling outside the dry-season range. A high ratio of dry season to wet season resources may support a sufficiently large animal population to impose non-trivial defoliation impacts on the outlying range. Increasing degrees of variability in primary production on areas used by animals for surviving the dry season increased the annual variation in animal abundance and reduced the mean. By comparison with a stable environment, for which the model predicts virtually stable <b>animal</b> <b>numbers</b> and constant, low defolia-tion intensity, variation in annual rainfall causes wide fluctuations in <b>animal</b> <b>numbers</b> and defoliation intensity. Under climatic variation, <b>animal</b> <b>numbers</b> can build up enough to impose much higher defoliation intensities than under a constant regime.

Females received intravaginal P 4 devices for their first, second or third use for five days plus 300 IU eCG IM and 5 mg dinoprost laterovulvar 24 h before device removal. Blood was collected at different moments. Transrectal ultrasonography was performed from device removal to ovulation. Part of the ewes were submitted to artificial insemination by laparoscopy (IAL - n= 55) with fresh semen, whereas the rest were bred by fertile rams (n= 41). On the initial 18 h, ewes that received devices for the first time showed higher P 4 concentrations (5. 1 ± 1. 8 vs 3. 5 ± 1. 4 vs 2. 4 ± 1. 1 - P< 0. 05).

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model was developed from literature data {{to predict the}} volume and composition of the effluent produced by pig farms. In the model, all nutrient fluxes starting from those entering the farm with the feeds up to those leaving the piggery with the slurry are considered. The first set of data predicted by the model {{is related to the}} environmental risk: nitrogen, phosphorus, copper, zinc and organic matter content of the slurry, and ammonia emitted to the air. The second set of data is related to the value of the slurry as fertiliser: dry matter, total and available N, organic matter, K, P and Ca. The main sources of variation considered in the model are those related to <b>animals</b> (<b>number</b> of pigs and performance), feeds (feed intake, feed composition and water consumption) and housing (ambient temperature, ventilation rate, frequency of slurry removal and cleaning). The model was validated using 19 experimental studies, most of them on growing pigs, performed in conditions close to those of commercial farms. Validation results showed that the model is precise and robust when predicting slurry volume (R 2 = 0. 96), and slurry nitrogen (R 2 = 0. 91), phosphorus (R 2 = 0. 95) and dry matter (R 2 = 0. 75) contents.

The instrument used in this study was a questionnaire comprising of personal data and risk and preventive behaviors infor-mation.

40|$|We relate φ(x,s), {{the average}} number of sites at a {{transverse}} distance x in the directed animals with s sites in d transverse dimensions, to the two-point correlation function of a lattice gas with nearest neighbor exclusion in d dimensions. For large s, φ(x,s) has the scaling form s Rdf(|x|/Rs), where Rs is the root mean square radius s of gyration of √animals of s sites. We determine the exact scaling function for d = 1 π to be f(r) = 2 √ 3 erfc(r/√ 3). We also show that φ(x = 0,s) can be determined in terms of the <b>animals</b> <b>number</b> generating function of the directed animals. The directed animals(DA) problem describes the large-scale geometrical structure of subcritical directed percolation clusters, and qualitatively models diverse situations such as trees, river networks and dilute polymers in a flowing solvent [1, 2]. Formally, it corresponds to p → 0 limit of the directed percolation problem [3]. The imposed directionality changes the universality class, and the large-scale structure of directed animals is different from isotropic animals. The enumeration of directed site animals in d + 1 dimensions is related to hard-core lattice gas(HCLG) at negative activity with repulsive interactions in d dimensions and the Yang-Lee edge problem in d dimensions [4, 5, 6, 7]. This equivalence helps to obtain several exact results for the directed animals problem [8, 9, 10, 11].

A free range/tethering, low input production system in Ndhiwa District of South-western Kenya is compared with a medium input stall fed production system in Kiambu District of Central Kenya. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of data derived from cluster analysis showed that number of <b>animals,</b> <b>number</b> of breeding sows and number of weaner pigs were {{a significant factor in}} classifying farms in Nhiwa and Kiambu. Analysis of blood and serum samples using a PCR assay demonstrated an average animal level positivity to ASFV of 28 % in two independent samplings in South-western Kenya and 0 % PCR positivity in Central Kenya. No animals were sero-positive in either study site using the OIE indirect-ELISA and none of the animals sampled exhibited clinical symptoms of ASF. The farms that contained ASFV positive pigs in Ndhiwa District were located in divisions bordering the Ruma National Park from which bushpig (Potamochoerus larvatus) incursions into farms had been reported. ASFV prevalence (P < 0. 05) was significantly higher at distances between 6 and 16 km from the National Park than at distances closer or further away. One of the 8 bushpigs sampled from the park, from which tissues were obtained was PCR positive for ASFV.

Comparative reductase inhibitors such as simvastatin increase HDL-cholesterol and decrease serum triglyceride and cholesterol. It is widely recognized that statins have organ protective nature and most effective for organ damage progressing. The aim of this study was evaluation of simvastatin on apoptosis in renal tissue after unilateral ureteral obstruction in rat. In this experimental study, 50 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to Unilateral Ureteral Obstruction (UUO) and randomly divided into five groups (ten rats in each groups) as follows: Control group, UUO, UUO/SIM, Sham-operated and Sham/SIM. Control animals received orally drug solvent by gavage for 15 days (start before operation). Unilateral ureteral obstruction was performed in groups 2 and 3 and sham operations were performed in groups 4 and 5. In group 2 animals received drug solvent and in group 3 animals received simvastatin (2 mg/kg/twice daily) for 15 days. Rats were sacrificed either at day 14. After sampling and fixation in saline formalin 10 %, tissue processing and preparing histological section and staining with tunnel method, apoptosis were studied in renal tissue in different groups.
