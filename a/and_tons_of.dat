5|$|Starting in fall 1942, {{large numbers}} of Soviet {{soldiers}} arrived in Fairbanks {{to work with the}} U.S. soldiers already in the town. The massive Lend-Lease effort required additional facilities to be built in and near Fairbanks. Ladd Field expanded in size, and the grounds of the U.S. Army post expanded until it met the city limits of Fairbanks. The University of Alaska, which saw most of its students taken up by the draft, provided office and dormitory space for U.S. and Soviet soldiers. Its professors also contributed to the war effort with specially created Russian language classes. Russian airmen were regular customers of Fairbanks stores, and they bought large amounts of consumer goods unavailable at home. To meet demand when Ladd Field was unusable due to fog, an airfield now known as Eielson Air Force Base was built southeast of Fairbanks. Although there were some conflicts between Soviet and U.S. soldiers and civilians, Lend-Lease operations in Fairbanks continued {{through the end of the}} war, and when Lend-Lease ended in September 1945, 7,926 aircraft <b>and</b> <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> cargo had been transferred to Soviet officials in Fairbanks.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{military}} use of the island and the failed resettlement, the islands are littered with abandoned concrete bunkers <b>and</b> <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> heavy equipment, vehicles, supplies, machines, and buildings. In September 1978, Trust Territory officials finally arrived to relocate the residents. The radiological survey of the northern Marshalls, compelled by the 1975 lawsuit, began only after the residents were removed and returned to Kili Island.|$|E
25|$|I {{started selling}} out on Dune. Looking back, it's no one's fault but my own. I {{probably}} shouldn't {{have done that}} picture, but I saw tons <b>and</b> <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> possibilities for things I loved, {{and this was the}} structure to do them in. There was so much room to create a world. But I got strong indications from Raffaella and Dino De Laurentiis of what kind of film they expected, and I knew I didn't have final cut.|$|E
50|$|In 1932, via Ukrainian {{commercial}} ports {{the following}} amounts were exported: 988,300 <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> grains <b>and</b> 16,500 <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> {{other types of}} cereals. In 1933, the totals were: 809,600 <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> grains, 2,600 <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> other cereals, 3,500 <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> meat, 400 <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> butter, <b>and</b> 2,500 <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> fish.

25|$|Beginning {{with the}} capture of the Philippines, the Japanese {{military}} confiscated all hard currency, both on a federal and individual level, replacing it with locally printed notes bearing a proclamation of military issue. All notes bear {{the name of the}} issuer, “The Japanese Government” while some notes proclaim the “promises to pay the bearer on demand”. Called “Mickey Mouse Money” by local Filipinos, it was valueless after the overthrow of the Japanese, <b>and</b> <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> it were burned. Japanese troops were ordered to destroy bank records and any remaining currency prior to capitulation.|$|E
25|$|Restoration {{was well}} {{underway}} {{by the end}} of October 2008. The gap was filled with 12,000 truckloads of sand <b>and</b> <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> rocks. Sand to fill the gap was donated by a landowner less than a mile away saving $3 million in fuel and material costs. Improvements were also underway on the dam to allow it to withstand a 1,000 year flood without the lake's level rising. The Wisconsin DNR chief of dams stated that the goal was to have the lake refilled by late spring 2009.|$|E
25|$|In a 2001 federal lawsuit, Vieques’ {{environmental}} groups and residents accused the Navy of causing “more damage {{than any other}} single actor in the history of Puerto Rico”. The prosecutors stated that the Navy’s activities contaminated much of the eastern portion of the island {{with a wide range of}} toxic substances. As cited by Franciscans International, according to the Navy’s figures, throughout the course of six decades about 5 million pounds (2,000 t) of ordnance was dropped on Vieques every year. Ordnance included toxic compounds and elements such as arsenic, lead, mercury, cadmium, depleted uranium and napalm, <b>and</b> <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> a fiberglass-like substance. Most of these toxins are persistent, meaning that they bioaccumulate.|$|E

50|$|Under the Coffee Sector Development Strategy for 2010-2015, {{production}} {{was aimed at}} 125,000 tons comprising 25,000 <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> arabica <b>and</b> 100,000 <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> robusta. The export was targeted to achieve 80,000 <b>tons</b> (15,000 <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> arabica <b>and</b> 65,000 <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> robusta). Domestic consumption was gauged at 10,000 <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> green coffee.|$|R
25|$|The Dieppe Raid of 1942 {{had shown}} that the Allies could not rely {{on being able to}} {{penetrate}} the Atlantic Wall to capture a port on the north French coast. The problem was that large ocean-going ships of the type needed to transport heavy and bulky cargoes and stores needed sufficient depth of water under their keels, together with dockside cranes, to off-load their cargo and this was not available except at the already heavily-defended French harbours. Thus, the Mulberries were created to provide the port facilities necessary to offload the thousands of men and vehicles, <b>and</b> <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> supplies necessary to sustain Operation Overlord and the Battle of Normandy. The harbours were made up of all the elements one would expect of any harbour: breakwater, piers, roadways etc.|$|E
25|$|Phou Kout, {{overlooking}} Muang Soui, {{still remained}} in enemy hands, blocking the RLG {{path to the}} Plain of Jars. The U.S. proposal to bomb the mountain with napalm was scotched because British Ambassador Donald Hopson objected to its use, and the paratroopers were unable to capture the heights in four attempts. Running into minefields, the paratroopers suffered 106 casualties from the explosives. The communists hung onto the Plain of Jars. Captured booty from Sala Phou Khoun included six armored cars, four Soviet 85mm field guns, four 105mm howitzers, 12 trucks, <b>and</b> <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> munitions. The General Staff of the Royal Lao Army was ecstatic. Some enthusiasts thought recapture of the entire Plain of Jars might still be possible. Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma, as well as Generals Kouprasith and Vang Pao all visited the site for inspection tours on 30 July 1964.|$|E
25|$|The next morning, three armored squadrons of the III Corps Assault Task Force rushed {{across the}} Cambodian border from Gò Dầu Hạ, aiming {{directly}} at 5th NVA Division HQ. Meanwhile, {{a task force}} composing of infantry and armor of IV Corps, originating from Mộc Hóa, maneuvered across the Cambodian border into the Elephant's Foot area to threaten the retreat of 275th NVA Regiment. The three armored squadrons continued their three-pronged advance 16 kilometers deep into the Cambodia before they veered south toward Hậu Nghĩa, and helicopters dropped troops unexpectedly on enemy positions, while other ARVN units conducted rapid operations into the region between Đức Huệ and Gò Dầu Hạ. On 10 May, when the last ARVN units returned to their base camp, enemy communications and supplies networks were seriously disrupted. The Communists suffered 1,200killed, 65 prisoners, <b>and</b> <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> weapons captured; while, due to speed, secrecy and coordination factors of a multi-faced operation, the ARVN suffered less than 100 casualties.|$|E

The principal agricultural products are grains (mostly wheat and barley), potatoes, vegetables, grapes (both table and wine), and fruits. In 2006, Armenia produced 212,500 <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> grain, 539,500 <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> potatoes, 915,000 <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> vegetables <b>and</b> melons, 286,000 <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> fruits, <b>and</b> 201,400 <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> grapes.

An English observer remarked {{that it was}} the [...] "stride of a giant." [...] The army's advance from Fort Monroe up the Virginia Peninsula proved to be slow.
