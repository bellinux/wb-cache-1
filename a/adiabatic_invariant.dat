Firstly, the El-Nabulsi-Pfaff variational problem from extended exponentially fractional integral is presented and the El-Nabulsi-Birkhoff equations are established. Secondly, the definitions and the criterions criteria of the Noether symmetric transformations and quasisymmetric transformations of the Birkhoffian system are given, and the Noether theorems of the system are established, which reveal the inner relationship between the Noether symmetries and the conserved quantities.

One {{of the reasons for the}} popularity of symplectic methods is the conservation of energy over very long periods of time up to small fluctuations that scale with the order of the method. In this paper, we discuss a qualitative feature of Hamiltonian systems with separated time scales that is also preserved under symplectic dis-cretization. Specifically, highly oscillatory degrees of freedom often lead to almost preserved quantities (<b>adiabatic</b> <b>invariants).</b> Using recent re-sults from backward error analysis and normal form theory, we show that a symplectic method, like the Verlet method, preserves those <b>adiabatic</b> <b>invariants.</b> We also discuss step-size restrictions necessary to maintain <b>adiabatic</b> <b>invariants</b> in practical computations. ...|$|R

50|$|The law {{is named}} for Wilhelm Wien, who derived it in 1893 based on a {{thermodynamic}} argument. Wien considered adiabatic expansion of a cavity containing waves of light in thermal equilibrium. He showed that under slow expansion or contraction, the energy of light reflecting off the walls changes {{in exactly the same}} way as the frequency. A general principle of thermodynamics is that a thermal equilibrium state, when expanded very slowly stays in thermal equilibrium. The adiabatic principle allowed Wien to conclude that for each mode, the <b>adiabatic</b> <b>invariant</b> energy/frequency is only a function of the other <b>adiabatic</b> <b>invariant,</b> the frequency/temperature.

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that the three {{established}} <b>adiabatic</b> <b>invariants</b> are separating invariants in the sense of Liouville. It is widely claimed that no more than three <b>adiabatic</b> <b>invariants</b> can exist for the motion of a point charge. However, additional independent (not separating) <b>adiabatic</b> <b>invariants</b> do exist. For a force free motion, the components of angular momentum provide two additional constants of motion. This result can be generalized to the Hamilton Jacobi equation. The number of independent constants of motion is reduced if there is a global symmetry. For a gyrating particle, neglecting a gyro helix type of invariant, four 'useful' invariants could exist. A radial drift invariant, corresponding to the average of the radial coordinate of the particle, is a constant of motion for a confined gyrating particle. For the special case of a screw pinch where each gyro center moves on a magnetic flux surface without mirror trapping, the radial drift invariant is the radial coordinate of the gyro center. For a screw pinch, the set of constants of motion consising of the energy, parallel velocity and radial drift invariant is convenient to model the equilibrium. Local Maxwellian distribution functions expressed in this set of invariants are demonstrated to provide MHD-type of equilibria, for which it is straightforward to model the radial profiles of the particle and field components.
