50|$|An {{abstraction}} is {{a conceptual}} entity that {{involves more than}} one single <b>actual</b> entity. Whitehead's ontology refers to importantly structured collections of <b>actual</b> entities as nexuses of <b>actual</b> entities. Collection of <b>actual</b> entities into a nexus emphasises some aspect of those entities, and that emphasis is an abstraction, because it means that {{some aspects of the}} <b>actual</b> entities are emphasised or dragged away from their actuality, while other aspects are de-emphasised.|$|R
40|$|How do we {{determine}} whether some candidate causal factor is an <b>actual</b> cause of some particular outcome? Many philosophers have wanted {{a view of}} <b>actual</b> causation which fits with folk intuitions of <b>actual</b> causation and {{those who wish to}} depart from folk intuitions of <b>actual</b> causation are often charged with the task of providing a plausible account of just how and where the folk have gone wrong. In this paper, I provide a range of empirical evidence aimed at showing just how and where the folk go wrong in determining whether an <b>actual</b> causal relation obtains. The evidence suggests that folk intuitions of <b>actual</b> causation are generated by two epistemically defective processes. I situate the empirical evidence within a background discussion of debunking, arguing for a two-pronged debunking explanation of folk intuitions of <b>actual</b> causation. I conclude that those who wish to depart from folk intuitions of <b>actual</b> causation should not be compelled to square their account of <b>actual</b> causation with the verdicts of the folk. In the dispute over <b>actual</b> causation, folk intuitions deserve to be rejected...|$|R

40|$|DE 102008053176 A 1 UPAB: 20100514 NOVELTY - The device (60) has a {{correlation}} measure determining device (62) for determining {{a correlation}} measure between an <b>actual</b> measuring package (MPi) and a reference measuring package. A reference measuring package selecting device (64) selects a reference measuring package (RP-N) that exhibits a correlation measure (acc-N). An evaluated value determining device (66) determines an evaluated value (o'i) for an <b>actual</b> orientation of a mobile terminal {{based on a}} reference orientation (o-N) of the selected reference measuring package. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (1) a method for evaluating an <b>actual</b> orientation of a mobile terminal at an <b>actual</b> geographical position (2) a computer program for performing a method for evaluating an <b>actual</b> orientation of a mobile terminal at an <b>actual</b> geographical position (3) a device for storing an <b>actual</b> orientation of a mobile terminal at an <b>actual</b> geographical position (4) a method for storing an <b>actual</b> orientation of a mobile terminal at an <b>actual</b> geographical position (5) a computer program for performing a method for storing an <b>actual</b> orientation of a mobile terminal at an <b>actual</b> geographical position. USE - Device for evaluating an <b>actual</b> orientation of a mobile terminal e. g. wireless local area network-compatible terminal such as personal digital assistant, of a wireless communications network at an <b>actual</b> geographical position for locating the mobile terminal within a building and/or an indoor area. Can {{also be used for}} digital camera, car radio or other components integrated to a motor vehicle or motorcycle. ADVANTAGE - The evaluated value determining device determines the evaluated value for the <b>actual</b> orientation of the mobile terminal based on the reference orientation of the selected reference measuring package that better corresponds to the <b>actual</b> orientation of the mobile terminal, so that the <b>actual</b> position of the mobile terminal can be determined in a reliable manner...|$|R

Its design proposals considered the prepared designs of layout of certain areas and results of Moscow reconstruction works. The 1952 Master plan, as well as the previous one, pointed out the necessity to form a protective green zone near the borders of the capital. The idea of construction of a high-class encircling highway along the periphery of the city became absolutely new.|$|E
5000|$|The percentage-of-completion method {{says that}} if the {{contract}} clearly specifies the price and payment options with transfer of ownership, the buyer is expected to pay the whole amount and the seller is expected to complete the project, then revenues, costs, and gross profit can be recognized each period based upon the progress of construction (that is, percentage of completion). For example, if during the year, 25% of the building was completed, the builder can recognize 25% of the expected total profit on the contract. This method is preferred. However, expected loss should be recognized fully and immediately due to conservatism constraint. Apart from accounting requirement, {{there is a need}} for calculating the percentage of completion for comparing budgets and <b>actuals</b> to control the cost of long term projects and optimize Material, Man, Machine, Money and time (OPTM4) [...]The method used for determining revenue of a long term contract can be complex. Usually two methods are employed to calculate the percentage of completion: (i) by calculating the percentage of accumulated cost incurred to the total budgeted cost. (ii) by determining the percentage of deliverable completed as a percentage of total deliverable. The second method is accurate but cumbersome. To achieve this, one needs the help of a software ERP package which integrates Financial, inventory, Human resources and WBS (Work breakdown structure) based planning and scheduling while booking of all cost components should be done with reference to one of the WBS elements. There are very few contracting ERP software packages which have the complete integrated module to do this.|$|E
50|$|In this view, an 'actual entity' has a {{philosophical}} status of fundamental ontological priority, while a 'real entity' is one {{which may be}} <b>actual,</b> or may derive its reality from its logical relation to some <b>actual</b> entity or entities. For example, an occasion {{in the life of}} Socrates is an <b>actual</b> entity. But Socrates' being a man does not make 'man' an <b>actual</b> entity, because it refers indeterminately to many <b>actual</b> entities, such as several occasions in the life of Socrates, and also to several occasions in the lives of Alcibiades, and of others. But the notion of man is real; it derives its reality from its reference to those many <b>actual</b> occasions, each of which is an <b>actual</b> entity. An <b>actual</b> occasion is a concrete entity, while terms such as 'man' are abstractions from many concrete relevant entities.|$|R

40|$|Based on the {{relevant}} {{data of the}} <b>actual</b> income and consumption of rural residents in Hebei Province from 1983 to 2007, the relationship between <b>actual</b> income and consumption of rural residents was tested by applying the co-integration theory and Granger causality test. The result shows that there is long-term stable equilibrium relationship between the net income per capita and consumption expenditure per capita of rural residents in Hebei Province from 1983 to 2007; the result of Granger causality test shows that the <b>actual</b> income of rural residents in Hebei Province has {{significant impact on the}} <b>actual</b> consumption, but the impact is weakened gradually; in short term, the impact of the <b>actual</b> consumption on the <b>actual</b> income is not so significant, but the impact will become significant gradually as time goes on. During the process of the mutual impact and function of the <b>actual</b> income and consumption of rural residents in Hebei Province, the impact of the <b>actual</b> income of rural residents on the <b>actual</b> consumption is mainly represented in short term; in middle term, the interactions between the <b>actual</b> income and <b>actual</b> consumption are significant; in long term, the impact of the <b>actual</b> consumption on the <b>actual</b> income is mainly displayed. According to the result, in short term the government in Hebei Province can expand consumption through increasing the income of rural residents, while in long term the government can drive the economic growth by expanding domestic demands.

5000|$|Before Nizam Sagar was built, the Manjira River was not {{properly}} harnessed and little water {{was being used}} by diverting water at Ghanpur Anicut for Irrigating about 5,000 acres and an open Channel called Mahaboob Nagar (Right Canal) in Medak District. The Ghanpur Anicut was the first scheme constructed across Manjira river in 1904 {{at a cost of}} Rs.18.00 Lakhs. Some years later, Nawab Ali Nawaj Jung Bahadur as Superintending Engineer added Fatch Nahar ( [...] Left canal [...] ) to increase the utility of the river later. The ayacut of 17,308 acres was being irrigated under this Ghanpur Anicut which subsequently increased to 30,000 acres as per <b>actuals.</b> Nizam sagar Project is the second irrigation scheme on Manjira river and the largest in the then Hyderabad state taken up during the year 1923 and completed by the year 1931. This Project was originally contemplated for utilization of 58.00 TMC of water to irrigate 2,75,000 acres in Banswada, Bodhan, Nizamabad and Armoor Taluks of Nizamabad District. After reorganization of States in 1956, the Manjira basin got distributed among the three states viz., Maharashtra, Karnataka and Telangana. Different irrigation schemes have come up in above three states. Some of them to mention are: Manjira Barrage and Singur Project in Telangana to meet the drinking water needs of twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad in Telangana. Karanja Project, Choukinala Project in Karnataka, Lower Tiruna Project, Manjira Project in Maharashtra State. Therefore, the inflows into Nizamsagar Project and as well as the low flows at Ghanpur Anicut during lean periods have dwindled considerably. Added to this the silting of reservoir has been at greater pace than designed for. From the investigation conducted by the A,.P.E.R.L. (Andhra Pradesh Engineering and Research Laboratories) Hyderabad in 1973, it was shown that the capacity of 29.7 TMC at original FRL of RL + 1400.50 ft. has been reduced to 11.8 TMC. In the remodeling proposals F.R.L. has been raised from +1400.50’ to +1405.00’ and the capacity at this new FRL of + 1405.00’ is 17.80 TMC. Apart from the above changes, out of the total localized ayacut of 2,75,000 acres, 28,085 acres have come under submergence of Sreeramsagar Project, 8,296 acres have come in the command of Lakshmi canal and Kakatiya Canal of Sreeramsagar Project, and 7,260 acres ayacut has not been getting water since inception of Nizamsagar Project. Thus, the settled ayacut of 2,75,000 acres has come down to 2,31,339 acres.|$|E
