500|$|In 2007, Sarah {{discovered}} fiancé Craig Dean's (Guy Burnet) {{affair with}} best friend John Paul McQueen (James Sutton), in the storyline dubbed [...] "McDean". The storyline reached its climax as {{the truth is}} revealed [...] "dramatically" [...] at her engagement party. Sarah walked in on the pair kissing, A Hollyoaks spokesperson stated {{in an interview with}} Digital Spy, [...] "John Paul's sick of all the lies and decides enough is enough. He sends a text from Craig's phone asking Sarah to come upstairs to see him. Safe in the knowledge that Sarah is on her way, JP sets about seducing Craig. When she walks in, she can't believe what she's looking at..." [...] Sarah tried to recover from this and Batley said: [...] "I don't think she got over Rhys, either. Craig more so, though. He absolutely destroyed her happiness and belief in men. Her relationship with Craig was going to be her life <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>put</b> so much effort into it, emotionally and physically, and it completely destroyed her." [...] Batley said Sarah could not handle the fact he cheated on her with another man. She opined this was the reason her storyline with Zoe and Lydia worked well. However John Paul's betrayal also had impact on Sarah's life because he was one of her best friends. Batley said: [...] "John Paul was her confidante and she thought they were best friends - it's hard to say which part made more of an impact on her. It was all just one horrible experience. It was the betrayal from both of them." ...|$|E
500|$|Laura Fissinger from South Florida Sun-Sentinel {{felt that}} [...] "'Virgin Tour' {{establishes}} Madonna {{more as a}} bimbo, rather than the strong, independent woman people think her to be." [...] David O'Reilly from Philadelphia Daily News said that with the concert [...] "Madonna proved once more why she was called a 'talentless bimbo'; it was utter trash." [...] Richard Defendorf of Orlando Sentinel gave a positive review, saying [...] "Madonna's 'Virgin Tour' was very enjoyable <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>put</b> her music video charms in her live performances." [...] Maya Hathoray from The Miami Herald said that [...] "We know [...] sexy, exotically beautiful and her funk/pop songs make us want to dance, but on stage, she is extremely tame compared to her raw persona in her music videos. She is like daddy's little girl." [...] Mary Edgar Smith from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution observed that [...] "It was obvious from the apparel of the young girls at last week's Virgin Tour concerts in Tampa and Orlando, Fla., that the 26-year-old singer [...] had more {{to give to the}} music world than what others suggest. She will be {{a force to be reckoned}} with." [...] Stephen Holden from The New York Times commented, [...] "While her pubescent lookalike fans cheer approvingly, the star's manipulation of such symbols as a wedding gown, a cross, furs and jewels becomes a lighthearted communal psychodrama. Madonna has brought traditional little girl's games of dress-up and playing with dolls (using oneself as model) into the television age by turning them into a public spectacle." [...] A review in Variety by John Gleeson said that [...] "Madonna's singing was like a soundtrack to a more visceral display of herself, her persona, her nonstop dancing and her surprisingly explicit sexual dare, which included a visual climax—so to speak—to every other song." [...] Paul Grein from Billboard said that [...] "Madonna's show was stylish, well-paced and consistently entertaining." ...|$|E
