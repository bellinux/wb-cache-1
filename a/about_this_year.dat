500|$|Abi's earlier storylines {{consist of}} her parents {{fighting}} for custody of her and her siblings, being injured in a collision with Deano Wicks' (Di Angelo) car and helping her friend Ben (Jones) with his abuse from stepmother Stella Crawford (Thompson) In February 2011, Abi {{was involved in a}} car accident with Max and would suffer severe injuries after their car collides with a lorry on the way to Tanya's wedding to her new partner Greg (Booth). The crash scenes were filmed on 6 March 2011 and aired on 14 April 2011. After these minor storylines, Joyner said that Fitzgerald should be involved in more complex storylines in 2012. She said, [...] "I think it's going to be an exciting year for Lorna. She's been a natural on the show ever since she was younger, and I think she's one of our best actresses. What's lovely <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>year</b> is that she'll be doing her GCSEs, and then once that's out of the way, she can get something that's a bit heavier and a bit bigger. She'll be old enough to work longer hours, so I think they'd be mad if they didn't give her something to sink her teeth into at some point this year".|$|E

[...] The writers of Billboard also put the album on their list of [...] "Best Documentary & Live DVDs" [...] for gifting in 2011.

Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker mentioned the album on his list of [...] "The Best Music of 2011: The American Singers" [...] praising the [...] "tightly corralled ecstasies" [...] of the revue further commenting: [...] "It was thrilling to watch [...] not because the show was unusually clever—Beyoncé was simply born to be on stage, wear shiny clothes, and work a room—but because Beyoncé means it, wants it, has the voice, and knows whom to hire to flesh out her ideas." [...] He added, [...] "And this vision does seem to be hers, as it's too idiosyncratic a mesh of tastes and textures to reflect some timid P.R. plan." [...] The live video of [...] "I Was Here" [...] from Live at Roseland: Elements of 4 received a nomination at the 43rd NAACP Image Awards presented on February 17, 2012, in the category for Outstanding Music Video.|$|E
