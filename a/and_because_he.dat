5|$|Jorgen Klubien {{said the}} movie was both his best and most bitter {{experience}} because he was fired before the movie premiered <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> feels John Lasseter wrote {{him out of the}} story of how the film got made.|$|E
5|$|Musicians {{and critics}} {{vary in their}} {{appraisal}} of Tristano as a musician. Some describe his playing as cold and suggest that his innovations had little impact; others state {{that he was a}} bridge between bebop and later, freer forms of jazz, and assert that he is less appreciated than he should be because commentators found him hard to categorize <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> chose not to commercialize.|$|E
5|$|Prominent anatomists and geologists such as Georges Cuvier, Richard Owen, Adam Sedgwick, and Charles Lyell {{attacked}} it vigorously. It {{has been}} suggested that Wallace accepted the idea of the transmutation of species in part because he was always inclined to favour radical ideas in politics, religion and science, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was unusually open to marginal, even fringe, ideas in science.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's because, as I was saying, 'e's 'ad {{too big a}} 'elping of success, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>'e</b> ain't {{a married}} man. You did say you wasn't a married man, didn't you, sir?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, indeed, I won't,' said Unity. 'It is {{not such}} a mighty matter, Miss Elfride. I says to myself, master's taking a hollerday, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> not been kind lately to Miss Elfride, she----' ...|$|R
5000|$|Schroeder opposes {{same-sex}} marriage <b>and</b> abortion <b>because</b> <b>he</b> believes they are [...] "morally lacking." ...|$|R
5|$|To {{keep costs}} down, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was most {{comfortable}} around them, Hitchcock took {{most of his}} crew from his television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents, including the cinematographer, set designer, script supervisor, and first assistant director. He hired regular collaborators Bernard Herrmann as music composer, George Tomasini as editor, and Saul Bass for the title design and storyboarding of the shower scene. In all, his crew cost $62,000.|$|E
5|$|Boycott {{told the}} BBC in 1965 that {{he chose to}} leave school at 17 because he no longer wished to be a {{financial}} strain on his parents, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> wanted to pursue his cricketing career. He worked as a clerk in the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance in Barnsley from 1958 to 1963, {{at the same time}} playing for a number of cricket clubs. Boycott captained the South Elmsall district team, and achieved a batting average of 70. He also played for the Yorkshire Federation's Under-18 team, and for Barnsley, where he was noticed by Clifford Hesketh, a member of Yorkshire's County Cricket team committee.|$|E
5|$|Crawford {{originally}} created Frog Fractions {{to entertain}} his friends, {{and to see}} their reactions when they first played it. Later on, he felt that with the indie genre taking off, Frog Fractions was taken more seriously among gamers. Crawford noted that although critics often described the game as a satire on old educational games, he never intentionally developed Frog Fractions with that in mind. Instead, Crawford explained that Frog Fractions had an educational theme because of the name's alliteration, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> considered educational games {{a part of his}} youth.|$|E
50|$|Kittu {{refuses to}} go back home <b>and</b> school, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was {{dismissed}} from his school.|$|R
50|$|Beaubois {{missed the}} games against Charlotte, Portland <b>and</b> Toronto <b>because</b> <b>he</b> twisted his left ankle during practice.|$|R
60|$|On {{reaching}} Mrs. Hanson's {{he found}} his roommates awake, <b>and</b> grumbling <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had not returned sooner.|$|R
5|$|However, Peckham {{worked hard}} to reorganise the estates of the diocese, and held an inquiry in 1283 through 1285 into the {{revenues}} of the see. He set up administrative structures in the manors that divided them into seven administrative groups. Peckham, though, was almost continually in debt, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was a Franciscan, he had no personal property to help with his living expenses. He had inherited the diocesan debts that his predecessor had allowed to accumulate, and never managed to clear them.|$|E
5|$|In {{regards to}} the English dub, Shinkai {{did not feel that}} he could judge the quality of the voice acting since he could not speak English natively. He felt that it was good due to the {{feedback}} he had received <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> could feel the emotion in the characters' voices. However, he noted that the experience would be different for viewers and that the final judgment could only be made by English-speaking audiences.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the KGB general {{set up by}} Koskov was to be General Gogol; however, Walter Gotell was {{too sick}} to handle the major role, and the {{character}} of Leonid Pushkin replaced Gogol, who appears briefly {{at the end of}} the film, having transferred to the Soviet diplomatic service. This was Gogol's final appearance in a James Bond film. Morten Harket, the lead vocalist of the Norwegian rock group A-ha (which performed the film's title song), was offered a small role as a villain's henchman in the film, but declined, because of lack of time <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> felt they wanted to cast him due to his popularity rather than his acting.|$|E
50|$|With {{the fighter}} certain to face charges and {{possible}} incarceration, his manager Doc Woods makes off with Jimmy's money and watch. Driving away with Goldie, {{they end up}} in a fiery car crash and are killed. Doc's face is unrecognizable, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> wearing Jimmy's watch, it is believed the boxer is dead.|$|R
60|$|For {{some reason}} he did not {{recognize}} his former prisoner <b>and</b> slave--possibly <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had so many of them.|$|R
60|$|Kit understood, <b>and</b> nodded <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{could not}} speak, and Adam, {{giving him a}} quiet smile, went to sleep again.|$|R
5|$|Rehman {{originally}} represented England, {{and played}} {{for them at}} under-18, under-19 and under-20 levels. Becoming the first English-born Pakistani to don an England senior football shirt seemed too far away, however, {{due to lack of}} first team opportunities at Fulham. Due to his Pakistani parentage, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> possessed dual Pakistani and British nationality, Rehman also qualified to represent Pakistan, and he eventually opted to play for them, as he considered it to be a more realistic option. A lot of British Asian groups were against this and wanted him to fight more for an England place to set a standard for English-Asian youth.|$|E
5|$|T.J. {{was born}} on June 6, 1981 in Beirut, Lebanon. He is of Armenian descent; {{he grew up in}} Cyprus, and came to the US {{for the first time in}} 1999. He is a Fulbright Scholar {{pursuing}} a master's degree in student affairs administration at Michigan State University. Outgoing and involved, T.J. is active in several student organizations pertaining to performance art, gender, and social change. He lives with other students in a housing cooperative. His mother lives in a close-knit Armenian community in Cyprus, where the news would surely travel if T.J. transitions. Because his mother opposes his transition, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> must return to Cyprus for two years due to a travel visa requirement, he has not yet started HRT.|$|E
5|$|Through {{his actions}} and speeches, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{was able to}} symbolize the popular Arab will, Nasser {{inspired}} several nationalist revolutions in the Arab world. He defined the politics of his generation and communicated directly with the public masses of the Arab world, bypassing the various heads of states of those countries—an accomplishment not repeated by other Arab leaders. The extent of Nasser's centrality in the region made it a priority for incoming Arab nationalist heads of state to seek good relations with Egypt, {{in order to gain}} popular legitimacy from their own citizens.|$|E
6000|$|Fire flashed {{from out}} the old Moor's eyes, [...] The Monarch's wrath began to rise, [...] <b>Because</b> <b>he</b> answered, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> [...] <b>He</b> spake {{exceeding}} well of laws.[573] [...] Woe is me, Alhama! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "First, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> is Maltese, Mr. Pathurst; <b>and</b> next, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> talks Cockney like a native. And {{depend upon}} it, he heard Bow Bells before he lisped his first word." ...|$|R
25|$|Saul {{died for}} his unfaithfulness {{which he had}} {{committed}} against the Lord, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> did not keep {{the word of the}} Lord, <b>and</b> also <b>because</b> <b>he</b> consulted a medium for guidance.|$|R
5|$|When he had {{resigned}} as governor in 1785, Hancock was again elected as a {{delegate to the}} Continental Congress, known as the Confederation Congress after the ratification of the Articles of Confederation in 1781. Congress had declined in importance after the Revolutionary War, and was frequently ignored by the states. Congress elected Hancock to serve as its president, but he never attended because of his poor health <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was not interested. He sent Congress a letter of resignation in 1786.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} University of Minnesota, Grant was {{selected}} {{in both the}} NFL and NBA Draft. He was selected {{in the first round}} (fourteenth overall) of the 1950 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles and fourth round (forty-second overall) selection of the Minneapolis Lakers in the 1950 NBA draft. He played thirty-five games during the 1949–50 NBA season and signed with the Lakers for the 1950–51 NBA season. He chose to continue his basketball career with the Lakers because they were local <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was offered a raise to stay for the season. Grant's close personal friend, Sid Hartman, was the Lakers' general manager, which may have influenced his decision to remain with the team. He averaged 2.6 points per game in his two seasons as a reserve with the Lakers and {{was a member of the}} 1950 championship team.|$|E
5|$|As the war progressed, Hitler's {{attention}} became {{focused on}} foreign affairs and {{the conduct of the}} war, to the exclusion of all else. Hess, not directly engaged in either of these endeavours, became increasingly sidelined from the affairs of the nation and from Hitler's attention; Bormann had successfully supplanted Hess in many of his duties and usurped his position at Hitler's side. Also concerned that Germany would face a war on two fronts as plans progressed for Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union scheduled to take place in 1941, Hess boldly decided to attempt to bring Britain to the negotiating table by travelling there himself to seek meetings with the British government. He asked the advice of Albrecht Haushofer, who suggested several potential contacts in Britain. Hess settled on fellow aviator Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, the Duke of Hamilton, whom he had never met. On Hess's instructions, Haushofer wrote to Hamilton in September 1940, but the letter was intercepted by MI5 and Hamilton did not see it until March 1941. Hamilton was chosen in the mistaken belief {{that he was one of}} the leaders of an opposition party opposed to war with Germany, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was a friend of Haushofer.|$|E
50|$|Władysław died between 1351 <b>and</b> 1352. <b>Because</b> <b>he</b> was childless, his {{districts of}} Dobrzyń and Łęczyca were merged to the Polish Kingdom.|$|R
50|$|The rule of Idacansás was {{so widely}} {{respected}} <b>and</b> feared <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{was able to}} change the chronological order of things happening.|$|R
60|$|Jim {{was puzzled}} <b>and</b> half-annoyed, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{could not tell}} what Bernard meant; but the latter {{began to talk about}} {{something}} else.|$|R
5|$|De Iniusta {{states that}} St-Calais was {{brought before the}} king and royal court for trial on 2 November 1088, at Salisbury, the king having confiscated the bishop's lands before the trial. At the trial St-Calais held that as a bishop {{he could not be}} tried in a secular court, and he refused to answer the accusations. Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, {{presented}} the king's case, declaring that the confiscated lands had been held as fiefs, and thus St-Calais could be tried as a vassal, not as a bishop. St-Calais objected, and continued to refuse to answer the allegations. After numerous conferences and discussions, the court held that St-Calais could be tried as a vassal in a feudal court. St-Calais then appealed to Rome, but his request was rejected by the king and the judges. Those judging the case held that because St-Calais never answered the formal accusation, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> appealed to Rome, his fief, or the lands he held as a bishop, was forfeit.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{his absence}} from Constantinople {{at the time}} of Phocas's takeover, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{retained}} a large measure of support within the soldiery, Priscus {{was the only one of}} Maurice's senior generals who was retained by the new regime, whereas Comentiolus and Peter were executed and Philippicus was banished to a monastery. A possible explanation for this comes from the later historian Paul the Deacon, who records, possibly based on early 7th-century sources, that Phocas had once served as an equerry under Priscus. At any rate, Priscus was soon counted among the main supporters of the new regime. In the winter of 602/603, he was made comes excubitorum, commander of the imperial bodyguard. In 606 or 607, he also married Phocas's daughter, Domentzia, becoming the effective heir-apparent to the sonless ruler. In the games celebrated at the Hippodrome to honor the event, however, Phocas reacted violently when he saw portraits of Priscus and Domentzia carried alongside his by the citizens. From this moment on, the chroniclers report, Priscus turned against Phocas.|$|E
5|$|Evan {{suspects}} {{that one of}} his neighbors is an alien due to his strange, stiff way of speaking <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> always seems to be watching Evan. As the watch scouts the neighbor's house, Bob learns that Chelsea is at an unsupervised party with Jason. Bob disobeys Evan's orders and rushes to the party with Franklin. Bob prevents Jason from raping Chelsea, but Jason beats him until Franklin intervenes. Evan and Jamarcus investigate the odd neighbor alone, discovering that he hosts orgies in his basement. When Bob returns, he and Evan argue over his putting his daughter above the watch. Bob is fired from the watch after saying Evan has no friends because he tries to control everything. Evan goes home and admits his infertility to Abby, who accepts the news and tells him they will work things out.|$|E

6000|$|... of Swinburne, or the mossiness of Mallarmé, Pound's verse {{is always}} {{definite}} <b>and</b> concrete, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> has always a definite emotion behind it.|$|R
60|$|The {{triangle}} and the eye {{became almost}} visible upon the black background of night. They were very angry. They were spinning {{round and round}} faster <b>and</b> faster. <b>Because</b> <b>he</b> was a bishop <b>and</b> <b>because</b> really <b>he</b> did not believe fully and completely in the Trinity. At {{one and the same}} time he did not believe in the Trinity and was terrified by the anger of the Trinity at his unbelief.... He was afraid. He was aghast.... And oh! he was weary....|$|R
