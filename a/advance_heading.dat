At 10:30 the Auckland Mounted Rifles, {{assisted}} by the 1st Squadron, assaulted and captured the Damieh bridge with a bayonet charge. The 10th Squadron arrived after the bridge was secured, and followed the Auckanders pursuing the withdrawing Turks into the hills. That night the regiment moved back across the bridge, leaving the 1st Squadron behind to guard it. The {{next day the}} brigade was ordered to resume the advance, so with the regiment as the vanguard, overcame the first obstacle, a Turkish machine-gun post. At 15:30 they reached Es Salt, passed through the town to the east, and formed a defensive position in the hills for the night. During the day they had captured 250 men, three artillery pieces and several machine-guns. The next day, 24 September, the regiment continued their <b>advance,</b> <b>heading</b> towards Suweile where {{they were joined by}} the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades. The next day about [...] north-west of Amman they came upon two Turkish redoubts covering the road to the town. While the brigade's other regiments deployed to attack them, the regiment, with a section from the Machine-Gun Squadron, were ordered to manoeuvre around to assault them from the rear. At midday they were confronted by around two hundred Turkish troops defending a ridge line. The regiment, through artillery and machine-gun fire, assaulted and captured the ridge. Not stopping to consolidate the position, they continued forward towards Amman. Once there the 10th Squadron, and part of the 8th Squadron, assaulted the Citadel in a bayonet charge, capturing 119 German prisoners and six machine-guns. The regiment then charged through the town, capturing the railway station at 16:30. All told the regiment took 1,200 prisoners, fourteen machine-guns, and other military stores. Their own casualties were one dead and two wounded. Casualties and illness had reduced the regiment's strength to only 350 men, many of whom were struck down with malaria. The regiment remained in the Amman area until the night of 29/30 September when they moved south to Kastel and secured a large number of prisoners from the Turkish II Corps. On 3 October they were relieved by the 3rd Light Horse Regiment, and started back towards the Jordan Valley. By 9 October they had crossed the valley and had reached Jerusalem; they then went back to Ayun Kara, their part in the war being over.|$|E

40|$|In the potash {{and rock}} salt mines {{operated}} by K+S Kali GmbH {{the extraction of}} the mineral is mainly done by drilling and blasting. Because of rock-saving reasons the final profile of the roadway is usually developed in progressive stages. First, an <b>advance</b> <b>heading</b> with a smaller cross section (the so called “cannon”) is driven by applying a parallel cut with large diameter boreholes which are left un-charged and smaller diameter boreholes which are charged with explosives. Further back, approximately one to two lengths of a round, the cannon is expanded to the full {{cross section of the}} roadway by drilling and blasting of the side walls and the roof. Especially the development of the cannon cross section requires high specific inputs of boreholes, explosives and thereby also time. With its dimensions of approximately three to six meter in width and about two to four meter in height the cannon has a cross section which is often developed with cutting technology. Therefore, in this thesis the development of the cannon by cutting technology in combination with the subsequent expansion by drilling and blasting has been examined {{as an alternative to the}} conventional procedure described above. For this purpose, a computer based model has been developed. In consideration of process-related variables the model allows the comparison of the conventional and the combined extraction technique regarding production performance and costs for the panel extraction in German potash mines. For the related production (extraction, loading and hauling) mining plans have been developed, economic feasibility studies as well as performance comparisons have been made and detailed process analyses have been conducted. The thesis concludes with recommendations and an outlook on the combined appli-cation of cutting technology with drilling and blasting in due consideration of company guidelines and framework conditions in German potash mines...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aims: To {{identify}} physician selection {{factors in}} the treatment of locally <b>advanced</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancer and how treatment outcome is affected by Tumor Board recommendations. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 213 patients treated for locally <b>advanced</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancer in a single institution was performed. All treatments followed Tumor Board recommendations: 115 patients had chemotherapy and radiation, and 98 patients received postoperative radiation. Patient characteristics, treatment toxicity, locoregional control and survival between these two treat- ment groups were compared. Patient survival was compared with survival data reported in randomized studies of locally <b>advanced</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancer. Results: There were no differences in comorbidity factors, and T or N stages between the two groups. A statistically significant number of patients with oropharyngeal and oral cavity tumors had chemoradiation and postoperative radiation, respectively (p < 0. 0001). Grade 3 - 4 toxicities during treatment were 48 and 87 % for the postoperative radiation and chemoradiation groups, respectively (p = 0. 0001). There were no differences in survival, locoregional recurrences and distant metastases between the two groups. Patient survival was comparable to survival rates reported by randomized studies of locally <b>advanced</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancer. Conclusion: Disease sites remained the key determining factor for treatment selection. Multidisciplinary approaches provided optimal treatment outcome for locally <b>advanced</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancer, with overall survival in these patients being comparable to that reported in randomized clinical trials.

40|$|Abstract: Background. Although {{meta-analysis}} {{showed that}} survival improved with concurrent chemoradiation in locally <b>advanced</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is still unique, because it renders curative surgery feasible for mar-ginally resectable {{head and neck}} cancer patients. Methods. We reviewed patients with locally <b>advanced</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancer, who had been treated with neoadjuvant chem-otherapy between June 1984 and February 2001 at the Seoul National University Hospital. Results. A total of 167 patients were included. After 2 to 3 chemotherapy cycles, either surgery (38 patients) or radiation (104 patients) was conducted. Those who received surgery exhibited better survival than those who received radiation [me-dian survival: not reached vs 33. 6 months (95 % CI: 22. 6 – 44. 7), p 5. 006].

30|$|Though Surgery with {{post-operative}} radiotherapy {{has been}} standard approach for locally <b>advanced</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancers, concurrent chemotherapy with radiotherapy {{can be an}} alternative according to recent NCCN guidelines 2014, but the role of brachytherapy boost {{is yet to be}} defined. EBRT with HDR brachytherapy boost has been shown to provide better local control rates compared to external beam radiation alone in locally advanced oral cavity cancers (Donath et al. 1995). Also, concurrent chemo radiation with Injection Cisplatin has proven its superiority over radiotherapy alone in locally <b>advanced</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancers (Studer et al. 2007).

30|$|Hyperfractionated RT has {{resulted}} in increased severe acute complications requiring intensive nutritional support for the completion of treatment in some patients. Wang et al. suggested that a prolongation of the treatment gap for more than 14  days adversely affected the local control in patients with locally <b>advanced</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancer treated with accelerated hyperfractionated radiation therapy, and the midcourse treatment gap should be kept as short as possible (Wang et al. 1996). In a Phase III trial of hyperfractionated RT with or without concurrent chemotherapy for locally <b>advanced</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancer, combined treatment for <b>advanced</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancer was more efficacious than hyperfractionated RT alone (Brizel et al. 1998). This trial included planned treatment breaks to avoid {{the withdrawal of the}} recruited subjects due to acute toxicity; eventually, the treatment time of RT in the hyperfractionated RT arm averaged 42  days, while that in the hyperfractionated RT plus concurrent chemotherapy arm averaged 47  days (Brizel et al. 1998). However, the long-term follow-up in the Phase III Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0129 trial indicated no difference in the overall survival or late toxicity with the use of accelerated-hyperfractionated vs standard RT plus cisplatin in patients with locally <b>advanced</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancer (Nguyen-Tan et al. 2014). Based on {{the results of the present}} study of CCRT using hyperfractionated RT and daily carboplatin, we believe that when a treatment interruption is needed because of the acute toxicities, hyperfractionated RT should be resumed as soon as possible independently while continuing the break of daily carboplatin.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Background and Aims: Chemotherapy is {{utilized}} {{as a part}} of combined-modality {{programs to}} achieve organ preservation and improve survival in patients with locally <b>advanced</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancer. Combined-modality protocols can be used in three forms: a) neoadjuvant induction chemotherapy before definitive surgery or radiotherapy; b) concomitant chemoradiotherapy; and c) sequential therapy consisting of induction chemotherapy and chemoradiation. The aim of this article was to study the role of these methods in treatment of locoregionally <b>advanced</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancers. Methods: An extensive search was performed on PubMed using five key phrases of head and neck, carcinoma, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, induction chemotherapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy. The search results were limited to randomized trials and meta-analysis. Results: Despite an improvement in organ preservation, induction treatment has no impact on survival. Chemoradiation provides higher survival and increased rate of organ preservation compared to radiation alone. Ongoing phase III comparisons of sequential therapy with chemoradiotherapy may help identify the superior approach. Conclusion: Although further studies in this field are required, taxane-based sequential therapy can be currently used as a reasonable alternative to chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally <b>advanced</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancers.
