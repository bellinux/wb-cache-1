5|$|At the Emperor's death, the Byzantines {{had control}} {{of most of}} Italy, North Africa, and a small {{foothold}} in southern Spain. Justinian's reconquests have been criticised by historians for overextending his realm <b>and</b> <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> stage for the early Muslim conquests, {{but many of the}} difficulties faced by Justinian's successors were due not just to over-taxation to pay for his wars but to the essentially civilian nature of the empire, which made raising troops difficult.|$|E
5|$|Christine {{admits she}} {{is afraid of}} the Phantom and tells Raoul he will never stop trying to {{recapture}} her. Raoul realizes {{that they can use}} the Phantom's opera to capture him, as he will surely attend. Don Juan Triumphant is performed, and the Phantom makes his entrance (having secretly replaced the lead) with Christine. Raoul can do nothing but watch from his box as Christine falls for the Phantom yet again. However, she once again removes his mask, revealing his deformities to the entire audience, who scream in fear. He escapes with her by dropping the chandelier <b>and</b> <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> opera house on fire.|$|E

5|$|Florida State's {{defense was}} ranked No. 43 {{in the country}} at the {{conclusion}} of the regular season. The Seminoles allowed 356.36 yards per game, on average. State's rushing defense was ranked No. 32 (126 ypg), while its passing defense was ranked No. 76 (230.36 ypg). The Seminoles' defensive squad was led by middle linebacker Bradley Jennings, who had 121 tackles during the regular season—the most on the team. Defensive tackle Darnell Dockett also was a standout performer statistically for the Seminoles, leading the team in tackles for loss <b>and</b> <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> single-season and single-game Florida State records in that category.|$|E
5|$|Mike and Sulley are {{led away}} by the CDA, and are {{expelled}} from the university {{as a result of}} their actions, but the other members of Oozma Kappa are accepted into the scare program the next semester, as Hardscrabble was impressed by their performances in the scare games. As Mike leaves on the bus, Sulley runs after him to raise his spirits. Hardscrabble then appears and wishes the two luck, claiming they were the first students to have surprised her.

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{defining}} actions of Sakic's career was {{at the conclusion of}} the 2001 playoffs. Defying the NHL tradition of the captain being the first to skate around with the Stanley Cup, Sakic passed it off to teammate Ray Bourque. Bourque, one of the best defensemen to ever play, had been traded to the Avalanche the year before after spending 21 years with the Boston Bruins <b>and</b> <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> record for most games played without winning the Cup. Sakic's handing of the Stanley Cup exemplifies his classiness and how he performs through actions rather than words.|$|E

5|$|On July 20, 1938, Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley {{named the}} 37-year-old Hartnett as the team's player-manager, {{replacing}} Charlie Grimm. When Hartnett {{took over as}} manager, the Cubs had been in third place, six games behind the first place Pittsburgh Pirates led by Pie Traynor. By September 27, with one week left in the season, the Cubs had battled back to within a game and a half game of the Pirates in the National League standings as the two teams met for a crucial three-game series. The Cubs won {{the first game of}} the series with a 2 to 1 victory by Cubs pitcher Dizzy Dean, cutting the Pirates' lead to a half game <b>and</b> <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> stage for one of baseball's most memorable moments.|$|E
5|$|The {{fight was}} a rematch {{of the main}} event at UFC 117, also a contest for the UFC Middleweight Championship. In that match, Silva (after losing four rounds on points) made Sonnen submit to a {{triangle}} choke with 1:50 left in the fight. Sonnen landed 320 strikes against Silva, {{more than any other}} fighter since UFC 5 (when Royce Gracie landed 355 strikes against Ken Shamrock). Silva had only absorbed 166 strikes (combined) in his previous 11 matches. With the win Silva retained the UFC Middleweight Championship, his undefeated record in the UFC and extended his winning streak to 13. The bout received the Fight of the Year award at the 2010 World MMA Awards. After UFC 117 Silva defended the title twice, with KO and TKO wins over Vitor Belfort and Yushin Okami respectively. Sonnen is also undefeated since UFC 117, defeating Brian Stann and Michael Bisping <b>and</b> <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> stage for the most-anticipated rematch of the year.|$|E

5|$|Fernando Alonso's luck finally ran out in Japan; {{having spent}} most of the season {{profiting}} from poor results from his rivals when he needed them the most, Alonso was the victim of a dramatic first corner clash, spinning out when he made contact with Kimi Räikkönen and paving the way for his championship rivals to make considerable inroads into his twenty-nine-point championship lead. Mark Webber was also caught up in the opening lap melee when he was hit by Romain Grosjean; Webber was forced to pit straight away, while Grosjean was given a ten-second stop-go penalty for causing yet another first lap incident. Bruno Senna also ran afoul of the stewards, hitting Nico Rosberg whilst trying to avoid Grosjean and Webber and earning a drive-through penalty for his troubles while Rosberg retired on the spot. Sergio Pérez added his name to the growing list of early retirements when he slid off at the hairpin under brakes and into the gravel trap whilst trying to force his way past a struggling Lewis Hamilton. Sebastian Vettel won the race from pole position, having led every lap of the race <b>and</b> <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> fastest lap time in the process to complete his second Grand Chelem. Felipe Massa finished second, his first podium result since the 2010 Korean Grand Prix, whilst Kamui Kobayashi claimed the first podium of his career – and the first podium for a Japanese driver at the Suzuka Circuit since Aguri Suzuki finished third in 1990 – after withstanding late pressure from Jenson Button.|$|E
5|$|In Egyptian mythology, the sun's {{emergence}} {{from the}} horizon each morning is likened to Ra's birth, {{an event that}} revitalizes him and {{the order of the}} cosmos. Ra emerges from the body of a goddess who represents the sky—usually Nut. Depictions of the rising sun often show Ra as a child contained within the solar disk. In this context, the Egyptologist Lana Troy suggests, the disk may represent the womb from which he is born or the placenta that emerges with him. The Eye of Ra can also {{take the form of a}} goddess, which according to Troy is both the mother who brings Ra forth from her womb and a sister who is born alongside him like a placenta. Ra was sometimes said to enter the body of the sky goddess at sunset, impregnating her <b>and</b> <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> stage for his rebirth at sunrise. Consequently, the Eye, as womb and mother of the child form of Ra, is also the consort of the adult Ra. The adult Ra, likewise, is the father of the Eye who is born at sunrise. The Eye is thus a feminine counterpart to Ra's masculine creative power, part of a broader Egyptian tendency to express creation and renewal through the metaphor of sexual reproduction. Ra gives rise to his daughter, the Eye, who in turn gives rise to him, her son, in a cycle of constant regeneration.|$|E
