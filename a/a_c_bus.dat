Unfortunately, software and circuits that communicate across the hardware/software boundary are tedious and error-prone to create. This suggests a more automatic way to synthesize them.

Hardware processes and software functions communicate through shared variables, hardware for which is automatically synthesized by the SHIM compiler, which generates C and synthesizable VHDL.

These interactions make it difficult to design and validate the hardware and software separately; instead, a verifiable co-design is required that takes them into account. This paper demonstrates a new approach to co-validation of hardware/software interfaces by formal, symbolic co-execution of an executable hardware model combined with the software that interacts with it. We illustrate and evaluate our technique on three realistic benchmarks in which software I/O is subject to hardware-specific protocol rules: a real-time clock, a temperature sensor on <b>an</b> I 2 <b>C</b> <b>bus,</b> and <b>an</b> Ethernet MAC. We provide experimental results that show our approach is both feasible as a bug-finding technique and scales to handle a significant degree of concurrency in the combined hardware/software model. © 2013 FMCAD Inc...|$|R

As a consequence {{it will be an}} increasingly challenging and time consuming task to design these systems. Although various new components are coming up, the problem of increasing cost for system design, debugging and verification is generally not addressed by conventional technology developments. A new concept to face these challenges will be presented. It is based on the constitution of a system by miniaturised modules, each representing a complete functionality like system control, data storage or sensing. The modules are planar System-in-Packages with embedded active and passive components, having typically 4 contacts on bottom and top. Besides the hardware an integral part of each module is its firmware, a small piece of software which controls a basic functionality, e. g. sensor data filtering and the communication with other modules.
