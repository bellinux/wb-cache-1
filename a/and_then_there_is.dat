5|$|Wheelbarrow: The {{earliest}} wheelbarrows with {{archaeological evidence}} {{in the form of}} a one-wheel cart come from 2nd century Han Dynasty Emperor Hui's tomb murals and brick tomb reliefs. The painted tomb mural of a man pushing a wheelbarrow was found in a tomb at Chengdu, Sichuan province, dated precisely to 118 CE. The stone carved relief of a man pushing a wheelbarrow was found in the tomb of Shen Fujun in Sichuan province, dated circa 150 CE. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> the story of the pious Dong Yuan pushing his father around in a single-wheel lu che barrow, depicted in a mural of the Wu Liang tomb-shrine of Shandong (dated to 147 CE). However, there are even earlier accounts than this that date back to the 1st century BCE and 1st century CE. The 5th century Book of Later Han stated that the wife of the once poor and youthful imperial censor Bao Xuan helped him push a lu che back to his village during their feeble wedding ceremony, around 30 BCE. Later, during the Red Eyebrows Rebellion (c. 20 CE) against Xin dynasty's Wang Mang (45 BCE23 CE), the official Zhao Xi saved his wife from danger by disguising himself and pushing her along in his lu che barrow, past a group of brigand rebels who questioned him, and allowed him to pass after he convinced them that his wife was terribly ill.|$|E
25|$|Lenore E. Walker {{presented}} {{the model of}} a cycle of abuse which consists of four phases. First, there is a buildup to abuse when tension rises until a domestic violence incident ensues. During the reconciliation stage, the abuser may be kind and loving <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a period of calm. When the situation is calm, the abused person may be hopeful that the situation will change. Then, tensions begin to build, and the cycle starts again.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{building blocks}} of experience, i.e. objective knowledge, are now in place. First there is the sensibility, which supplies the mind with intuitions, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> the understanding, which produces judgments of these intuitions and can subsume them under categories. These categories lift the intuitions {{up out of the}} subject's current state of consciousness and place them within consciousness in general, producing universally necessary knowledge. For the categories are innate in any rational being, so any intuition thought within a category in one mind is necessarily subsumed and understood identically in any mind. In other words, we filter what we see and hear.|$|E

500|$|Wisden {{considered}} Crawford's bowling {{to be one}} of {{the most}} successful features of the tour and praised his ability to spin the ball, reporting: [...] "It was said of Crawford that even on the most perfect wickets he could at times make the ball break back." [...] He led the English Test bowling averages with 30 wickets at an average of 24.73. His batting was less productive than expected; in five Tests, he scored 162 runs at an average of 18.00, batting usually at number eight. In all first-class matches on the tour, he scored 610 runs at 26.52 and took 66 wickets at 25.19. Crawford's contributions enhanced his growing reputation and critics expected his cricket to go from strength to strength. Australian batsman Clem Hill commented: [...] "There are grand cricketers in this game, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> Jack Crawford." [...] The final game in the series turned out to be Crawford's last Test. In 12 Test matches, he had scored 469 runs at an average of 22.33 and took 39 wickets at 29.48.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{anthropologist}} Helen Fisher, {{there are}} numerous psychological reasons for adultery. Some people may want to supplement a marriage, solve a sex problem, gather more attention, seek revenge, or have more excitement in the marriage. But based on Fisher's research, {{there also is a}} biological side to adultery. [...] "We have two brain systems: One of them is linked to attachment and romantic love, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> the other brain system, which is purely sex drive." [...] Sometimes these two brain systems are not well connected, which enables people to become adulterers and satisfy their sex drive without any regards to their attachment side.|$|E

2500|$|Dhyana is {{integrally}} {{related to}} Dharana, one leads to other. Dharana {{is a state}} of mind, Dhyana the process of mind. Dhyana is distinct from Dharana in that the meditator becomes actively engaged with its focus. Patanjali defines contemplation (Dhyana) as the mind process, where the mind is fixed on something, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> [...] "a course of uniform modification of knowledge". Adi Shankara, in his commentary on Yoga Sutras, distinguishes Dhyana from Dharana, by explaining Dhyana as the yoga state when there is only the [...] "stream of continuous thought about the object, uninterrupted by other thoughts of different kind for the same object"; Dharana, states Shankara, is focussed on one object, but aware of its many aspects and ideas about the same object. Shankara gives the example of a yogin in a state of dharana on morning sun may be aware of its brilliance, color and orbit; the yogin in dhyana state contemplates on sun's orbit alone for example, without being interrupted by its color, brilliance or other related ideas.|$|E

2500|$|The missing {{leaves are}} {{a subject of}} fierce controversy. The Jews of Aleppo claim that they were burned. However, {{scholarly}} analysis has shown no evidence of fire having reached the codex itself (the dark marks on the pages are due to fungus). Some scholars instead accuse members of the Jewish community of having torn off the missing leaves and keeping them privately hidden. Two [...] "missing" [...] leaves have turned up, one in 1982 {{and the other in}} 2007, leaving open the possibility that even more may have survived the riots in 1947.

Hafeez, who has found {{an appreciation for}} Sufi Islam, stated in a lecture that he felt more at home in Israel than anywhere else, and added [...] "I'm proud to call myself a Zionist". Hafeez visited university campuses around the UK presenting his talk, [...] "The Day I Stopped Hating Israel – Confessions of an ex-Radical." [...] In {{an interview with the}} Jewish Telegraph, Hafeez said: [...] "It's not about being pro-Israel or pro-truth, I just want the facts to be heard. Israel is a democratic state. Muslims in Israel have more rights than possibly most Muslims in the Arab world <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> the reality of the actual conflict.

It drives me insane when I hear musicians that don't understand how fortunate they are that they don't have to go and pump gas for twelve hours a day.
