40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the practice characteristics and pediatric care provided by licensed <b>acupuncturists.</b> DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Boston metropolitan area. SUBJECTS: 227 licensed <b>acupuncturists</b> were surveyed; 140 (62 %) responded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Demographics, (2) practice characteristics, (3) pediatric care, (4) recommendations of peers recognized as experts in pediatric acupuncture. RESULTS: (1) Demographics: 70 % Caucasian, 61 % female; (2) practice characteristics: average of 39 visits weekly {{with an average}} charge of $ 54 for a 57 -minute visit; patients were typically scheduled for follow-up once or twice weekly; only 5 % of fees were covered by insurance; 80 % recommended herbal remedies and 66 % dispensed herbs in the office; (3) few <b>acupuncturists</b> treated more than one child per week; most used non-needle techniques or Japanese-style acupuncture to stimulate points in children; 85 % would refer a febrile two-week-old infant immediately to a physician; (4) only 17 <b>acupuncturists</b> were recommended by three or more peers and saw three or more patients weekly; their practices were all in wealthy suburban areas. CONCLUSIONS: Most <b>acupuncturists</b> in the Boston area are Caucasian and female. Compared with physicians, they schedule patients for more frequent follow-up, allocate more time, {{are less likely to}} be reimbursed by insurance, and treat fewer children. Additional studies are needed to assess effectiveness, quality, and access to acupuncture services for adults and children...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} on brain plasticity has fascinated researchers for decades. Use/training {{serves as an}} instrumental factor to influence brain neuroplasticity. Parallel to acquisition of behavioral expertise, extensive use/training is concomitant with substantial changes of cortical structure. <b>Acupuncturists,</b> serving as a model par excellence to study tactile-motor and emotional regulation plasticity, receive intensive training in national medical schools following standardized training protocol. Moreover, their behavioral expertise is corroborated during long-term clinical practice. Although our previous study reported functional plastic brain changes in the <b>acupuncturists,</b> whether or not structural plastic changes occurred in <b>acupuncturists</b> is yet elusive. Cohorts of <b>acupuncturists</b> (N =  22) and non-acupuncturists (N =  22) were recruited. Behavioral tests were delivered to assess the acupuncturists' behavioral expertise. The results confirmed acupuncturists' tactile-motor skills and emotion regulation proficiency compared to non-acupuncturists. Using the voxel-based morphometry technique, we revealed larger grey matter volumes in <b>acupuncturists</b> in the hand representation of the contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (SI), the right lobule V/VI and the bilateral ventral anterior cingulate cortex/ventral medial prefrontal cortex. Grey matter volumes of the SI and Lobule V/VI positively correlated with the duration of acupuncture practice. To our best knowledge, this study provides first evidence for the anatomical alterations in <b>acupuncturists,</b> which would possibly be the neural correlates underlying acupuncturists' exceptional skills. On one hand, we suggest our findings may have ramifications for tactile-motor rehabilitation. On the other hand, our results in emotion regulation domain {{may serve as a}} target for our future studies, from which we can understand how modulations of aversive emotions elicited by empathic pain develop in the context of expertise. Future longitudinal study is necessary to establish the presence and direction of a causal link between practice/use and brain anatomy...|$|R
2500|$|Another non-medicinal treatment, {{which does}} not require at-home exercises, is acupuncture.

2500|$|The skin is sterilized {{and needles}} are inserted, {{frequently}} {{with a plastic}} guide tube. Needles may be manipulated in various ways, including spinning, flicking, or {{moving up and down}} relative to the skin. Since most pain is felt in the superficial layers of the skin, a quick insertion of the needle is recommended. Often the needles are stimulated by hand in order to cause a dull, localized, aching sensation that is called de qi, as well as [...] "needle grasp," [...] a tugging feeling felt by the <b>acupuncturist</b> and generated by a mechanical interaction between the needle and skin. Acupuncture can be painful.

Evidence {{from a recent}} large-scale trial (ACUDep) suggests that acupuncture and counselling can provide longer-term benefits for many patients with depression. This paper describes the strategies practitioners reported using to promote longer-term benefits for their patients. A qualitative sub-study of practitioners (<b>acupuncturists</b> and counsellors) embedded in a randomised controlled trial. Using topic guides, data was collected from telephone interviews and a focus group, altogether involving 19 counsellors and 17 <b>acupuncturists.</b> Data were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic content analysis. For longer-term impact, both <b>acupuncturists</b> and counsellors encouraged insight into root causes of depression {{on an individual basis}} and saw small incremental changes as precursors to sustained benefit. <b>Acupuncturists</b> stressed the importance of addressing concurrent physical symptoms, for example helping patients relax or sleep better in order to be more receptive to change, and highlighted the importance of Chinese medicine theory-based lifestyle change for lasting benefit. Counsellors more often highlighted the importance of the therapeutic relationship, emphasising the need for careful "pacing" such that the process and tools employed were tailored and timed for each individual, depending on the "readiness" to change. Our data is limited to acupuncture practitioners using the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, and counsellors using a humanistic, non-directive and person-centred approach. Long-term change appears to be an important focus within the practices of both <b>acupuncturists</b> and counsellors. To achieve this, practitioners stressed the need for an individualised approach with a focus on root causes...|$|R
