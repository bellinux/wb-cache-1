5|$|Prior {{to making}} landfall, the storm {{produced}} strong waves on the Florida west coast. Following {{a summer of}} tropical moisture in Florida, Henri brought more heavy rainfall to the saturated state, peaking at 9.09in (230mm) in Hialeah in the southeast portion of the state. Two other areas experienced over 7in (180mm), though most areas received only light rainfall. In Hernando County, a stationary thunderstorm dropped over 5in (125mm) of rain in around an hour. It caused a rapid flooding of roads, though quickly retreated. Damage was minor, {{due to lack of}} many homes in the area. <b>A</b> <b>feeder</b> band in Charlotte County dropped 7in (180mm) of rain in three hours, flooding numerous streets and homes. Throughout Florida, damage was minimal, and there were no deaths. However, lightning from <b>a</b> <b>feeder</b> band injured a man in Lee County, while an indirect injury occurred from a car crash due to hydroplaning.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} evaluate the effects of feeder design (conventional dry feeder vs. wet-dry feeder) and adjustment on growing-finishing pig performance. In both experiments, all pigs (PIC 337 × 1050) were fed the same corn-soybean meal diets with 15 % dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS). In Exp. 1, 1, 296 pigs (initially 43 lb) were used in a 69 -d study. From d 0 to 27, 3 feeder settings were evaluated for each feeder type. Numbered settings (located in each feeder) were 6, 8, and 10 for the conventional dry feeder and 6, 10, and 14 for the wet-dry feeder. An increased setting number corresponded to a greater opening. From d 27 to 69, all feeders were adjusted to an opening of approximately 1 in. (conventional dry feeder setting 8; wet-dry feeder setting 14). From d 0 to 27, pigs using <b>a</b> wet-dry <b>feeder</b> had lower (P < 0. 02) ADFI and better F/G than pigs using <b>a</b> conventional dry <b>feeder.</b> Increasing the feeder setting improved (linear, P < 0. 01) ADG, ADFI, and d- 27 BW of pigs using <b>a</b> wet-dry <b>feeder</b> and increased (linear, P < 0. 01) ADFI of pigs using <b>a</b> conventional dry <b>feeder.</b> From d 27 to 69, ADG and ADFI of pigs using <b>a</b> wet-dry <b>feeder</b> were greater (P < 0. 01) than those of pigs using <b>a</b> conventional dry <b>feeder,</b> and increasing the feeder setting from d 0 to 27 resulted in greater (linear, P < 0. 01) ADFI and poorer F/G for pigs using <b>a</b> wet-dry <b>feeder.</b> Overall (d 0 to 69), pigs using <b>a</b> wet-dry <b>feeder</b> had greater (P < 0. 05) ADG, ADFI, final BW, and better F/G than pigs that used <b>a</b> conventional dry <b>feeder.</b> Increasing the <b>feeder</b> setting of <b>a</b> wet-dry <b>feeder</b> from d 0 to 27 resulted in greater (linear, P < 0. 01) ADG and ADFI, poorer (linear, P < 0. 03) F/G, and heavier (linear, P < 0. 01) final BW. <b>Feeder</b> setting of <b>a</b> conventional dry <b>feeder</b> from d 0 to 27 did not affect overall performance. In Exp. 2, 1, 248 pigs (initially 73 lb) were used in a 93 -d study. Three feeder settings were evaluated throughout the study for each feeder type (conventional dry feeder set at 6, 8, and 10; wet-dry feeder set at 10, 14, and 18). Overall, pigs using <b>a</b> wet-dry <b>feeder</b> had greater (P < 0. 05) ADG, ADFI, final BW, HCW, backfat depth, and feed cost but reduced (P < 0. 04) fat-free lean index (FFLI) compared with pigs using <b>a</b> conventional dry <b>feeder.</b> Increasing the <b>feeder</b> setting of <b>a</b> wet-dry <b>feeder</b> resulted in greater (linear, P < 0. 05) ADG, ADFI, final BW, HCW, backfat depth, and feed cost. When HCW {{was used as a}} covariate, FFLI of pigs using <b>a</b> wet-dry <b>feeder</b> decreased (linear, P < 0. 02) with increased feeder opening. Increasing the <b>feeder</b> setting of <b>a</b> conventional dry <b>feeder</b> had no effect on growth performance and carcass characteristics. In conclusion, the growth rate of pigs improved with <b>a</b> wet-dry <b>feeder</b> compared with <b>a</b> conventional dry feeder; however, the growth of pigs using <b>a</b> wet-dry <b>feeder</b> was more sensitive to differences in feeder adjustment...|$|R
5|$|A {{junior and}} infant {{department}} opened in September 1997 after {{the closure of}} St Audrey's Convent school. St Audrey's was <b>a</b> <b>feeder</b> school, and its closure allowed the then headmaster, Robert Repper, to transfer most of the teaching staff to the new junior school. The junior and infant school {{has now become a}} preparatory school for the senior school. It was retitled as Magdalene House in 2005, a reference to a 17th-century scholarship which allowed two Wisbech Grammar School pupils to study at Magdalene College, Cambridge. There were 177 pupils registered in 2008, of whom 23 were in reception and the rest in years 1 to 6.|$|E

Kerry studied at <b>a</b> <b>feeder</b> program for Disney animators at CalArts, and became interested in 2-D computer animation. While there, he {{realized that it was}} possible to apply some of the techniques associated with animation to live-action. Conran had been out of film school for two years and was trying to figure out how to make a movie. He figured that Hollywood would never take a chance on an inexperienced, first-time filmmaker, so he decided to make the movie himself.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{also has}} a history of success in ice hockey {{including}} four State Championships (1947, 1953, 1955, 1963), three second-place finishes, and three third-place finishes in 22 State Tournament appearances. Johnson was the only Twin Cities high school to win the Minnesota high school boys' hockey tournament for the first 25 years. Herb Brooks, who coached the Miracle on Ice gold medal winning team, played on the school's 1955 state championship winning team. Brooks' number five jersey was retired following his death in 2003. During the 1950s students shoveled off parts of Lake Phalen because there were no enclosed ice arenas. Most of the bantam hockey team players from the East Side attend either Johnson or Hill-Murray School. During the 1950s and 1960s Johnson was considered <b>a</b> <b>feeder</b> school for the University of Minnesota's ice hockey team. Recently the school's teams have suffered from lack of enrollment in the sports teams. Johnson is along with Como Park the only Saint Paul City Conference school to field a hockey team.|$|E

5|$|The {{formation}} of Lake Tauca and the later Coipasa lake phase {{is associated with}} the Central Andean Pluvial Event, which occurred from 18,000–14,000 to 13,800–9,700 BP. During this epoch, major environmental changes occurred in the Atacama as precipitation increased between 18° and 25° degrees south. In some areas, oases formed in the desert and human settlement began. During the Coipasa lake cycle, precipitation may have focused on the southern Altiplano and been transported there from the Chaco; the main Tauca cycle may have been accompanied by precipitation from the northeast. A glacial advance in the Turbio valley (<b>a</b> <b>feeder</b> of the Elqui River) between 17,000 and 12,000 years ago has been attributed to the Central Andean Pluvial Event. Other indicators point to dry conditions in central Chile during the highstand of Lake Tauca.|$|E
5|$|The league drew ten member clubs {{from each}} of the two leagues for its inaugural season. The clubs {{selected}} to join from the Midland Combination were Barwell, Boldmere St Michaels, Bolehall Swifts, Pershore Town, Sandwell Borough, Shepshed Dynamo, Shifnal Town, Stapenhill, Stratford Town and West Midlands Police. Those selected from the West Midlands (Regional) League were Brierley Hill Town, Chasetown, Halesowen Harriers, Hinckley Athletic, Knypersley Victoria, Oldbury United, Paget Rangers, Rocester, Rushall Olympic and Willenhall Town. Paget Rangers won the first league championship by a margin of 12 points from Hinckley Athletic in the 1994–95 season, and gained promotion to the Southern League. The Alliance's status as <b>a</b> <b>feeder</b> to the Southern League was cemented when Armitage 90 were relegated in the opposite direction.

5|$|He {{remained}} in Swansea for another year, {{working in the}} local steelworks whilst playing local football, until Swansea Town manager Haydn Green visited Ford's home. Green had taken over Swansea in 1939 and had set about establishing the side as <b>a</b> <b>feeder</b> club for local youth talent {{due to a lack}} of finances, offering 17 year old Ford an amateur contract in 1940 before signing him to his first professional contract with Swansea two years later. With the Football League suspended due to the Second World War, Ford featured for the club in wartime Combination leagues. Having spent his youth career as a defender, during his war service, Ford grew substantially in both height and weight and the Sergeant Major in charge of the local army football side switched him to centre-forward where he flourished, scoring 41 times between 1945 and 1946 in regional wartime competitions. After he was moved from his original army posting in Rhyl to new barracks in Colchester, Ford appeared for Leyton Orient in wartime fixtures, scoring three times in four appearances for the side. Following the return of league football after wartime, he made his fully professional competitive debut and played sixteen times in the first half of the 1946–47 season for the Swans in the Second Division before moving to Aston Villa in January 1947 for a fee of £9,500 plus Tommy Dodds.|$|E
