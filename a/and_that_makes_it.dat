500|$|A common {{criticism}} of Majora's Mask {{is that it}} is not as accessible as Ocarina of Time. GameSpot, which awarded Ocarina of Time a 10/10, gave Majora's Mask an 8.3/10, writing that some might [...] "find the focus on minigames and side quests tedious and slightly out of place." [...] Game Revolution wrote that it [...] "takes a little longer to get into this Zelda", but also that [...] "there are moments when the game really hits you with all its intricacies and mysteries, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> all worthwhile." ...|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} critical. John Keegan from Critical Myth awarded the episode 5 out of 10 and wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode {{is an odd}} {{divergence}} from the normal series format, prompted by the production schedule for the feature film. [...] Acceptable as a stand-alone episode, it simply doesn’t fit within the overall scope of the series, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> hard to judge objectively." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it one star out of four. She noted that the episode, much like the earlier season five entry [...] "Unusual Suspects" [...] was [...] "filler", but that, unlike the earlier episode, [...] "Travelers" [...] was [...] "not particularly entertaining." [...] Vitaris criticized the character of Arthur Dales and wrote that he was [...] "not an intriguing character". However, she did praise the visuals, describing them as [...] "outstanding".|$|E
500|$|A {{controversy}} arose {{over the}} writing credits on [...] "Irreplaceable". Ne-Yo told MTV: [...] "Apparently Beyoncé {{was at a}} show somewhere and right before the song came on she said, 'I wrote this for all my ladies' and then the song came on...The song is a co-write. I wrote the lyrics, I wrote all the lyrics. Beyoncé helped me with the melodies and the harmonies and the vocal arrangement <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> a co-write. Meaning my contribution and her contribution made that song what it is." [...] In 2011, Ne-Yo said that he wrote the song for himself, but {{thought that it would}} be better suited for Beyoncé, and later regretted giving the song to her. Some of Beyoncé's fans read Ne-Yo's remark as disrespectful towards her. However, he clarified his comment later through Twitter, writing, [...] "I said I originally wrote the song for me....Once I realized how the song comes across if sung by a guy, that's when I decided to give it away." ...|$|E

500|$|Vanity Fair {{commented that}} [...] "it's {{hard to imagine}} that there was a time before Meryl Streep was the greatest-living actress". Emma Brockes of The Guardian notes that despite Streep's being [...] "one of the most famous actresses in the world", it is [...] "strangely hard to pin an image on Streep", in a career where she has [...] "laboured to {{establish}} herself as an actor whose roots lie in ordinary life". Despite her success, Streep has always been modest about her own acting and achievements in cinema. She has stated that she has no particular method when it comes to acting, learning from the days of her early studies that she cannot articulate her practice. She said in 1987, [...] "I have a smattering of things I've learned from different teachers, but nothing I can put into a valise and open it up and say, 'Now which one would you like?' Nothing I can count on <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> more dangerous. But then the danger makes it more exciting." [...] She has stated that her ideal director is one who gives her complete artistic control, and allowing her a degree of improvisation and to learn from her own mistakes.|$|E
500|$|On 14 May, with Estádio da Luz nearly sold-out, Benfica {{received}} Sporting for a title-deciding Lisbon Derby. The high-pressure {{match was}} unlocked in the 83rd minute when Luisão jumped higher than Ricardo and {{headed in the}} winning goal. Trapattoni tried to calm excess confidence by saying Benfica still had not won the league title. Two days after the game, in an interview to Italian sports daily Gazzetta dello Sport, Trapattoni announced his intention to leave Benfica {{at the end of}} the season and return to Italy. On 22 May, Benfica visited the Estádio do Bessa to face Boavista, needing just one point to win the title. Benfica scored the opening goal with a penalty from Simão. Boavista equalized minutes later but the score remained drawn, ensuring the title for Benfica, their first in ten years and 31st overall. Trapattoni said, [...] "Winning is always hard. This title was amazing and one of the most important of my career. It was won in a new culture for me <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> even better." [...] In the last game of the season, the 2005 Taça de Portugal Final, Benfica's Simão opened the scoring but allowed Vitória de Setúbal to score twice, losing Benfica their ninth tournament final. The loss also prevented a double for Benfica; it would have been their first since 1987. Two days after the defeat, Trapattoni confirmed he was leaving Benfica for personal reasons, ending his one-year tenure in Portugal.|$|E

You're more confident about what you're doing and having some gravitas, {{but at the}} same time, because we're having more and more expectations put on us by everyone, the complexities are increasing. Even Aussie bands that used to take five or six people on the road are now taking 11. That seems to be the magic number, even for a new starting-off band. What they are doing is working to put on the best show they can. Through that the festival needs more production, more riders, more hotel rooms, more everything.|$|E

2500|$|Big Black's songs {{explored}} {{the dark side}} of American culture in unforgiving detail, acknowledging no taboos. Albini's lyrics openly dealt with such topics as mutilation, murder, rape, child molestation, arson, immolation, racism, and misogyny. [...] "That's just what was interesting to me as a postcollegiate bohemian", he later remarked. [...] "We didn't have a manifesto. Nothing was off-limits; it's just that that's what came up most of the time." [...] Many of his songs told miniature short stories of sociopaths doing evil things that the average person might merely contemplate. Some, such as [...] "Cables", [...] "Pigeon Kill", and [...] "Jordan, Minnesota", were based on real events, or things that Albini had witnessed during his midwest upbringing. He compared the stories to Ripley's Believe It or Not!, saying that [...] "If you stumble across something like this, you think 'This can't be!' But {{it turns out to be}} true, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> even wilder." ...|$|E
2500|$|The United States Senate {{unanimously}} {{passed a}} resolution which urged the International Olympic Committee to hold one minute of silence. The United States House of Representatives unanimously passed a similar bill brought by the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, but the full body did not receive a chance to vote on it. The House of Representatives held {{a moment of silence}} themselves, and one-minute speeches were given on the House floor as well. Representative Eliot Engel, who cosponsored the resolution in support of a minute of silence, blamed the IOC's refusal on [...] "being political because frankly they’re afraid of offending some of the Arab nations." [...] However, Engel said, “If you have this fiction of fraternal bonds and commonality of feeling, then it's appropriate for the IOC to act without any politics whatsoever. The only reason they haven’t done this in 40 years is because it's Israeli athletes, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> even more disgraceful.” ...|$|E
2500|$|John O'Hara {{wrote in}} the New York Times; [...] "The most {{important}} author living today, the outstanding author {{since the death of}} Shakespeare, has brought out a new novel. The title of the novel is Across the River and Into the Trees. The author, of course, is Ernest Hemingway, the most important, the outstanding author out of the millions of writers who have lived since 1616." [...] Tennessee Williams, in The New York Times, wrote: [...] "I could not go to Venice, now, without hearing the haunted cadences of Hemingway's new novel. It is the saddest novel in the world about the saddest city, and when I say I think it is the best and most honest work that Hemingway has done, you may think me crazy. It will probably be a popular book. The critics may treat it pretty roughly. But its hauntingly tired cadences are the direct speech of a man's heart who is speaking that directly for the first time, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it,</b> for me, the finest thing Hemingway has done." ...|$|E
