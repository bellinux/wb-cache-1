To assure victory, the player must gather resources in order to pay for new units, buildings and more advanced technology. Resources must also be preserved, as no new resources become available as the game progresses, for example, trees that are cut down will not grow back.|$|E
5|$|Much {{more than}} a {{renovation}} project, Domitian's building program {{was intended to be}} the crowning achievement of an Empire-wide cultural renaissance. Around fifty structures were erected, restored or completed, achievements second only to those of Augustus. Among the most important new structures were an odeon, a stadium, and <b>an</b> <b>expansive</b> palace on the Palatine Hill known as the Flavian Palace, which was designed by Domitian's master architect Rabirius.|$|E

5|$|In May 1969, {{discontent with}} Krieger's {{economic}} policies led to riots {{in the cities}} of Corrientes, Rosario and Córdoba. Krieger was removed, but the Onganía administration was unable to agree on an alternative economic policy. By 1970, the authorities were no longer capable of maintaining wage restraints, leading to a wage-price spiral. As the economy started to languish and import substitution industrialization ran out of steam, urban migration slowed. Per capita income fell, {{and with it the}} standard of living. Perón’s third term of office was characterized by <b>an</b> <b>expansive</b> monetary policy, which resulted in an uncontrolled rise in the level of inflation.|$|E

5|$|SCE Cambridge {{wanted the}} game to possess a unique lead character, thus Sorrell worked with script doctor Martin Pond whilst {{creating}} <b>an</b> <b>expansive</b> backstory for the lead protagonist, Sir Daniel Fortesque.

This idea, along with the player-character's unusual appearance, turned appealing to some sectors of the gaming community, as lead designer Wilson later recalled that female gamers considered Sir Daniel to be endearing, and was considered a sex symbol in France.|$|E
5|$|The Somali National University (SNU) was {{established}} in the 1950s, during the trusteeship period. In 1973, its programmes and facilities were expanded. The SNU developed over the next 20 years into <b>an</b> <b>expansive</b> institution of higher learning, with 13 departments, 700 staff and over 15,000 students. On 14 November 2013, the Cabinet unanimously approved a federal government plan to reopen the Somali National University, which had been closed down in the early 1990s. The refurbishing initiative cost US$3.6 million, and was completed in August 2014.|$|E
5|$|A case {{in which}} the Taft Court struck down {{regulation}} that generated a dissent from the chief justice was Adkins v. Children's Hospital. Congress had decreed a minimum wage for women in the District of Columbia. A 5–3 majority of the Supreme Court struck it down. Justice Sutherland wrote for the majority that the recently ratified Nineteenth Amendment, guaranteeing women the vote, meant that the sexes were equal when it came to bargaining power over working conditions; Taft, in dissent, deemed this unrealistic. Taft's dissent in Adkins was rare both because he authored few dissents, and because {{it was one of the}} few times he took <b>an</b> <b>expansive</b> view of the police power of the government.|$|E

5|$|Allison {{resigned}} in 1947, {{a year after}} professional football resumed, and his position {{was taken over by}} Tom Whittaker, the club's first-team trainer. Intent on playing <b>an</b> <b>expansive</b> style of football, he purchased Don Roper and converted Ian McPherson's position from defender to winger. The changes had the desired effect as Arsenal won the 1947–48 First Division championship. Whittaker won the club's third FA Cup in 1950 and repeated early league success in 1952–53. The club's success began to wane after this, which in turn commenced a stressful period for Whittaker. In October 1956 he died of a heart attack, aged 58. Jack Crayston presided over first-team affairs as caretaker, before he was named permanent manager at the end of 1956. His time was brief compared to his predecessors and left the club in May 1958, achieving a twelfth-place finish in the league.|$|E
5|$|For the {{follow-up}} to their 1998 album Aquemini, the duo worked to create <b>an</b> <b>expansive</b> and experimental musical aesthetic, incorporating a {{diverse array of}} styles including funk, rave music, psychedelia, gospel, and rock within a Dirty South-oriented hip hop context. During the recording sessions, André 3000 began moving beyond traditional rapping {{in favor of a}} more melodic vocal style, an approach to which Big Boi and several other producers were initially unaccustomed. Lyrically, the duo touched upon a wide range of subject matter, including sexuality, politics, misogyny, African-American culture, parenthood, and introspection. Stankonia featured appearances from a variety of local musicians discovered by the group while they were visiting clubs in the city of Atlanta, Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Fay was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to make landfall on Bermuda since Emily in 1987. The sixth named storm and fifth hurricane of the 2014 Atlantic hurricane season, Fay evolved from a broad weather disturbance several hundred miles northeast of the Lesser Antilles on October 10. Initially a subtropical cyclone with <b>an</b> <b>expansive</b> wind field and asymmetrical cloud field, the storm gradually attained tropical characteristics as it turned north, transitioning into a tropical storm early on October11. Despite being plagued by disruptive wind shear {{for most of its}} duration, Tropical Storm Fay steadily intensified. Veering toward the east, Fay briefly achieved Category 1 hurricane status while making landfall on Bermuda early on October12. Wind shear eventually took its toll on Fay, causing the hurricane to weaken to a tropical storm later that day and degenerate into an open trough early on October13.|$|E

5|$|Miller and Pflueger were {{selected}} in 1923 to build <b>an</b> <b>expansive</b> new headquarters tower for Pacific Telephone & Telegraph. In June 1924, Pflueger showed {{his plans for}} a $3million skyscraper, 26 stories high, designed with continuous vertical elements and a progression of step-backs narrowing the floors near the top. Arthur Frank Mathews {{was brought in to}} paint a mural in the boardroom on the 18th floor. The structure was fully devoted to offices for 2,000 employees, mostly female. Pflueger's vision was strongly influenced by Eliel Saarinen's second-place entry in the competition to design the Tribune Tower in Chicago. In June, 1925, the Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Company Building was completed for $4million ($million in current value), becoming the tallest building in San Francisco for the next 40 years, tied by the Russ Building in 1927.|$|E
5|$|On August23, 1981, {{following}} {{several days}} of tranquil weather, a Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough (TUTT) began building westward from the International Dateline, near Wake Island. Over the following 36hours, <b>an</b> <b>expansive</b> area of convection developed southwest of the organizing TUTT. On August25, surface observations on Guam in the Mariana Islands indicated {{the presence of a}} low pressure system. Coinciding with this, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) declared the formation of a tropical depression at 06:00UTC. Weather reconnaissance missions throughout the day indicated a 1006mbar (hPa; 29.71inHg) center west of Guam, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. Following improvement in the convective structure, the JTWC began warning on the cyclone as Tropical Depression 18W at 18:00UTC, at which time the depression was situated roughly 665km (415mi) west-northwest of Guam.|$|E
5|$|Progression through Shadow of the Colossus {{occurs in}} cycles.

To find each colossus, Wander may raise his sword while in a sunlit area to reflect beams of light, which will converge when the sword is pointed in the right direction of the next encounter. The journey to a colossus is seldom a straightforward matter: stretches of varied terrain often require that a detour be taken along the way. Most colossi are located in remote areas, such as atop cliffs or within ancient structures.|$|E
