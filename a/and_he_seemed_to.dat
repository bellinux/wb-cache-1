5|$|For the old Diefenbaker {{was in full}} cry. All {{the agony}} of the {{disintegration}} of his government was gone, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be a giant revived by his contact with the people. This was Diefenbaker's finest election. He was virtually alone on the hustings. Even such loyalists as Gordon Churchill had to stick close to their own bailiwicks, where they were fighting for their political lives.|$|E
25|$|Poor Sir Ed, {{who is a}} quiz of {{the first}} magnitude, and who I believe had not given a dinner for twenty years before, was all bustle and anxiety during {{the whole of the}} entertainment. He {{informed}} us at the outset that {{he had been able to}} get but two bottles of champagne, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> take it much to heart when anybody showed a disposition to drink other wine in a much larger proportion.|$|E
25|$|During {{his time}} at Anfield his presence, {{intelligent}} play and experience made a strong impression on the younger members of the squad <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> inspire those around him when they found themselves in difficulty. This {{is one of the}} qualities that have led to his nickname The Enforcer by which he was known throughout his career. In recognition for his contribution to the club's success, McAllister was named as number 32 in the 100 Players Who Shook The Kop survey.|$|E

25|$|Löhe {{was born}} on 21 February 1808 {{in the town of}} Fürth in present-day Middle Franconia. The son of a shopkeeper, his father died in 1816 <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have had a very lonely childhood. He {{received}} his basic education from C. L. Roth’s gymnasium in Nuremberg and was admitted to theological study at the University of Erlangen in 1826. He was heavily influenced by the Reformed professors of theology Christian Krafft and Thomas von Kempen. Ultimately, he was introduced to the Lutheran Confessions and became a Lutheran under the teaching of David Hollaz. In 1828 he spent a term at the University of Berlin, attracted not so much by the lectures of the professors as by the sermons of the famous preachers. Löhe graduated from the Erlangen in 1830, but waited until 1831 before receiving a pastoral assignment to Kirchenlamitz in Upper Franconia (Northeastern Bavaria).|$|E
500|$|MacMillan {{testified that}} for the {{duration}} of the affair she continued to have sex with Brownlee [...] "from terror and because he told me it was my duty to do it <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have an influence over me which I could not break." [...] She claimed that there had been no love accompanying the sex, and that it had been physically painful for her on each occasion.|$|E
500|$|In his {{biography}} of Ranjitsinhji, Simon Wilde suggests that MacLaren {{had to work}} very hard for his employer in this period, and found little time for cricket. In addition, his batting form was poor throughout, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be in bad physical condition when he occasionally found time to play. Before Ranjitsinhji returned to India, MacLaren resigned as his secretary—although he went with him to India for a holiday. According to Wilde, the resignation was to allow MacLaren to play more regularly, but [...] "he never really recovered his form". In summarising Ranjitsinhji's life at this time, Wilde suggests that his unreliability with money was quite calculated, and writes: [...] "Many of his off-the-field exploits with A. C. MacLaren... will probably never be known, but it seems clear that sometimes they were not averse to conducting themselves in the fashion of E. W. Hornung's fictional character Raffles, the cricketing burglar." ...|$|E
50|$|A 60-year-old man, he is Hae-young (soil)'s father. As {{a man he}} is talented in cooking, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be {{more patient}} and calm then Hae-young (soil)'s mother.|$|R

500|$|What unity English Protestants {{had shared}} in the plot's {{immediate}} aftermath began to fade when in 1625 James's son, the future Charles I, married the Catholic Henrietta Maria of France. [...] Puritans reacted to the marriage by issuing a new prayer to warn against rebellion and Catholicism, and on 5November that year, effigies of the pope and the devil were burnt, the earliest such report of this practice {{and the beginning of}} centuries of tradition. During Charles's reign Gunpowder Treason Day became increasingly partisan. [...] Between 1629 and 1640 he ruled without Parliament, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> support Arminianism, regarded by Puritans like Henry Burton as a step toward Catholicism. [...] By 1636, under the leadership of the Arminian Archbishop of Canterbury William Laud, the English church was trying to use 5November to denounce all seditious practices, and not just popery. Puritans went on the defensive, some pressing for further reformation of the Church.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the end of}} the First World War Greece {{occupied}} Smyrna from 15 May 1919 and put {{in place}} a military administration. The Greek premier Venizelos had plans to annex Smyrna <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be realizing his objective in the Treaty of Sèvres, signed 10 August 1920. (However, this treaty was not ratified by the parties; the Treaty of Peace of Lausanne replaced it.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Writing in 1862 in his Scores and biographies, Arthur Haygarth called Pilch [...] "the best batsman {{that has}} ever yet appeared". The main {{characteristic}} of Pilch's batting was his forward play, a shot that was called 'Pilch's poke'. Haygarth further wrote : [...] "His style of batting was very commanding, extremely forward, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> rush to the best bowling by his long forward play before it had time to shoot or rise, or do mischief by catches".|$|E

2500|$|Hughes hit {{consecutive}} hundreds {{at the end}} of the 2010/11 {{season to}} earn the praise of Australian chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch. In his last two first class matches for New South Wales in the 2010/11 season he scored 54, 115, 138 and 93. Australia's chairman of selectors, Andrew Hilditch, said [...] "I was thrilled for Phil, I think he turned the corner the last game. I spent a bit of time with him before the last Shield game <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be in a really good place. Having had a tough season, to emerge like he has is a credit to him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Local {{resident}} Cacilia Davis {{was walking}} her dog {{at the scene}} of the Moskowitz and Violante shooting when she saw [...] patrol officer Michael Cataneo ticketing a car that was parked near a fire hydrant. Moments after the traffic police had left, a young man walked past her from the area of the car, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> study her with some interest. Davis felt concerned because he was wielding in his hand some kind of [...] "dark object". She ran to her home only to hear shots fired behind her in the street. Davis remained silent about this experience for four days until she finally contacted police, who closely checked every car that had been ticketed in the area that night.|$|E
2500|$|Common {{themes in}} his thought can, however, be {{identified}} and discussed. His earliest work emphasized the opposition of Apollonian and Dionysian impulses in art, and the figure of Dionysus continued {{to play a role}} in his subsequent thought. Other major currents include the will to power, the claim that God is dead, the distinction between master and slave moralities, and radical perspectivism. Other concepts appear rarely, or are confined to one or two major works, yet are considered centerpieces of Nietzschean philosophy, such as the Übermensch and the thought of eternal recurrence. His later works involved a sustained attack on Christianity and Christian morality, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be working toward what he called the transvaluation of all values (Umwertung aller Werte). [...] While Nietzsche is often associated in the public mind with fatalism and nihilism, Nietzsche himself viewed his project as the attempt to overcome the pessimism of Arthur Schopenhauer.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know how}} it is with father sometimes, Judith," [...] she said, [...] "When {{overtaken}} with liquor he doesn't always know what he says or does, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be overtaken with liquor now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} no {{opportunity}} of finding out yet," [...] was the reply. [...] "I {{believe that he is}} staying in the hotel, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be on very intimate terms with Miss Beverley." ...|$|R
50|$|The aged chief Powhatan made {{no major}} {{response}} to this English expansion, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been losing effective control to his younger brother Opechancanough during this time, while the English consolidated their new footholds.|$|R
2500|$|In his report, {{the scout}} stated that his only {{weakness}} {{was a lack}} of baseball experience. The scout said that he {{could be one of the}} all-time greats barring any injuries. He had a minor shoulder injury in the beginning of his collegiate football career, which didn't cause him issues in the long term. The scout also noted that this was his first year playing baseball <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be a [...] "do it all type of player" [...] and also stated he was [...] "the best pure athlete in America today". This was in April 1985 when Bo was a 22-year-old scholarship athlete at Auburn University trying to make an even bigger name for himself than he already had in his football career. In this scouting report Jackson's worth to an MLB team was listed at only $200,000, much less than what he would end up taking home later on in his short-lived careers.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1996–97, Caddick found himself rather more {{permanently}} back in the England set-up, touring Zimbabwe and New Zealand. [...] Caddick's involvement in Zimbabwe was limited to two warm up matches, with his performances described by one newspaper as akin to [...] "a camel loping {{into one of the}} hot dry harmattans that blow off the Kalahari". [...] He thus travelled to his native New Zealand with a point to prove. [...] He again failed to shine during the warm up matches, and was left out again for the first Test. [...] His chance to prove his critics wrong came in the second Test, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> take it with a menacing streak to his game, snatching four wickets in the first innings and a further two in the second. [...] He retained his place for the third Test and the majority of the One Day International series, and along with Darren Gough was one of the stand out bowlers of the tour.|$|E
2500|$|... "There was a {{guy named}} Dan Jones who was then about 60years old, who was a wino {{who lived in a}} fleabag in the bad part of town. Jones was well known to rescue. In June of '69 they got a call—man down—it was Jones. They put the paddles on him, he was in VF, started CPR, zapped him, he came back to sinus rhythm, brought him into ER and three days later he was out and walking around. In gratitude, about a week later, he came down to Station 1, which he had never done before, and he {{said he would like to}} talk to the man who saved his life. They told me they had never seen Dan Jones in a clean shirt and sober, both of which he was that day. He would {{periodically}} come to the fire house and just say hello <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be sober. In my talks in those days I said this was the new cure for alcoholism. That was our first true save." ...|$|E

2500|$|At Butcher Gate, {{there were}} running clashes between the RUC {{and at least}} 300 {{nationalist}} youths. Cars were hijacked and burnt and one was set ablaze after being driven through the gates of a bank. It is claimed that the RUC fired [...] "upwards of 1,000 plastic bullets", many of them fired [...] "indiscriminately" [...] and aimed [...] "above the waist, in direct contravention of the rules governing {{the use of such}} lethal weapons". A 16-year-old boy suffered [...] "a fractured skull, a broken jaw, and shattered facial bones amongst other injuries" [...] after allegedly being beaten by RUC officers. He was on life support for some time afterwards. An eyewitness described seeing one man, allegedly an onlooker, being shot in the face: [...] "The side of his face was completely torn away, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> just slump to the ground". Several others suffered serious head injuries. Nine were admitted to Altnagelvin Hospital with plastic bullet injuries. At least 30 others sought treatment at first aid houses or at Letterkenny Hospital across the border. Most of downtown Derry was sealed off by the RUC and British Army.|$|E
2500|$|The {{foreign policy}} of the Republic of Vietnam (RVN), {{according}} to Fishel, [...] "to a very considerable extent", was the policy of Ngo Dinh Diem himself during this period. He was the decisive factor in formulating foreign policies of RVN, besides the roles of his adviser – Ngô Đình Nhu and his foreign ministers: Trần Văn Độ (1954–1955), Vũ Văn Mẫu (1955–1963) and Phạm Đăng Lâm (1963) who played subordinate roles in his regime. Nevertheless, since Diệm had to {{pay much attention to}} domestic issues {{in the context of the}} Vietnam War, foreign policies did not receive appropriate attention from him. Diệm paid more attention to countries that affected Vietnam directly <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> personalize and emotionalize relations with other nations. The issues Diệm paid more attention in foreign affairs were: the Geneva Accords, the withdrawal of the French, international recognition and the cultivation of legitimacy of RVN and the relations with the United States, Laos (good official relations) and Cambodia (complicated relations, especially in border disputes, minority ethnics), and especially North Vietnam. Besides, RVN also focused on the diplomatic relations with other Asian countries to secure its international recognition.|$|E
