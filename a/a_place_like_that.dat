2500|$|Joseph tours {{as a solo}} {{artist in}} the UK, {{and in the early}} 2000s he began touring in Canada and the United States. [...] One of his songs, [...] "All This Time" [...] was borne of a trip through the Canadian wilderness. [...] Of the track's inspiration, Joseph explains, [...] "It humbles you visiting <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> Anyone who has an ego problem needs to {{backpack}} through Canada for a while." [...] He is also a regular performer at major Canadian folk festivals, including the Vancouver and Edmonton Folk Music Festivals, and at the annual Greenbelt Festival in the UK.|$|E
2500|$|Patton married Cristina Zuccatosta, an Italian artist, in 1994. The couple divided {{their time}} between San Francisco and Bologna, Italy, until their {{separation}} in 2001. Patton used {{to own a}} home in Bologna and speaks Italian. Regarding his close association with Italy, Patton stated, [...] "It happened after I got married. I married an Italian lady, and I had to get acquainted. Basically, it started with the language because her family and her parents didn't really speak English. I had to learn the language, so I did that. The longer you spend in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> it really sucks you in. It really envelopes you and {{makes you feel like}} one of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. The Tenth {{was ordered}} to Manchester, and they could hardly expect {{me to go to}} <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> Besides, I found the major monstrous rude." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was always}} a chapel man; but--I don't know how it is--there's {{something}} in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> this <b>that</b> makes church seem more--more suitable; my wife always had a leaning that way. I never conceal my actions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Delightful," [...] her {{companion}} assented. [...] "I suppose great wealth has its obligations, but why {{any human being}} should rear such a structure as what he calls his Borghese villa, when he has <b>a</b> charming <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> to live in, I can't imagine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. Now that Mr. Morgan has gone, Mrs. Morgan {{wants to}} go to live with her {{children}} in Vancouver. She will sell cheaply, for <b>a</b> big <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> in <b>a</b> small village like the Glen will not be very easy to dispose of." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You couldn't have {{described}} <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> unless you had been," [...] said Miss Rose nodding. [...] "I hope {{you took the}} poor people some nice hot soup." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It won't bear much looking at; we {{had better}} unyoke," [...] he said. [...] "If anybody had told me in England that I'd ever {{flounder}} through <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> I'd--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tis dishgraceful,' he sez, 'that I {{would be}} {{expected}} to go to <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> Was she a pretty woman?'' he sez, an' at that he set off double quick.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But she {{was better}} {{about it than}} I,' said Gillian; 'mamma, your trusting me in that way {{is better than a}} dozen balls. Besides, I know I should hate being there without you; I'm a great old thing, as Jasper says, neither fish nor fowl, you know, not come out, and not a little girl in the schoolroom, and it would be very horrid going to <b>a</b> grand <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> on one's own account.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Tom gave a great sigh. [...] "No," [...] he said, [...] "if I must, I must; I don't {{mind the}} part of it that you do. I only hate the name of it, and the being tied down to <b>a</b> country <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> while you go out {{thousands}} of miles off to these savages; {{but if it is}} the only thing to content you, I wont stand in your way. I can't bear your looking disconsolate." ...|$|R
5000|$|Verma felt daunted as {{the very}} {{prospect}} of acting, She commented saying, [...] "Hailing from <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> Bilaspur <b>that</b> is nowhere even distantly associated to glitz and glamour, acting did seem a bit far-fetched." [...] Before starting her career off as an actress, Swati trained at the Kishore Namit Kapoor Acting Institute in Mumbai. She made her acting debut in episodic serial Ek din ki vardi (Sahara). Later, she appeared in Suraag (SAB TV) and Aryaman (Doordarshan network).|$|R
6000|$|... "All the better," [...] Dave said; [...] "we {{can make}} a fight for it in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> and hold it till dark. They can't be far behind us now. Stop the horses a moment and listen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hein! You think so, do you? See {{how it will}} be when I come to talk to him! A shrewd fellow {{like that}} who got out of the Micklethwayte concern just in time. Catch him giving up <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> though he may humbug you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, me boy, you're {{up a tree}} as far as office goes. <b>A</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> niver suited me, because, you see, that poker of a young lord {{expected}} {{so much of a}} man; but {{you don't}} mind that kind of thing, and I thought you were as snug as snug." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] he said, [...] "as though I {{were in a}} foreign country, and I look upon what lies about me as if {{everything}} had always been as I see it. This town is so different from anything I have ever known that I cannot imagine it has changed from a condition which was once familiar to me. At Bixbury, however, I think the case will be otherwise. If there are changes there I shall notice them. In <b>a</b> little <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> however, I have hopes that the changes will not be great." ...|$|R
60|$|For {{a time he}} {{cherished}} {{a design}} of hunting up Parsons, getting him to throw up his situation, and going with him to Stratford-on-Avon and Shrewsbury and the Welsh mountains and the Wye and <b>a</b> lot of <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> for <b>a</b> really gorgeous, careless, illimitable old holiday of a month. But alas! Parsons had gone from the St. Paul's Churchyard outfitter's long ago, and left no address.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not so {{sure about}} that," [...] said Mrs. Aleshine. [...] "I'm used to the ship, and as long as it didn't sink I'd prefer it. There's plenty to eat on board of it, and good beds to sleep on, which is more than can be {{expected}} on <b>a</b> little bushy <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> ahead of us. But then, the ship might sink all of a suddint, beds, vittles, and all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How men {{can stay}} up all night and gamble in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> I can't understand," [...] he murmured to himself. [...] "I would rather be in bed and asleep. And it stands to reason the proprietors have the best of it, {{otherwise}} how could they run such a gorgeous house?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{no doubt}} of it. Really, I'm not being funny, Miss Wetherford, when I say you've done {{something}} heroic. It's no easy thing to come into <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> and make it habitable. It shows immense courage and self-reliance on your part. It's {{precisely the kind of}} work this whole country needs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The mate is asleep, and {{the fire}} has burned down; that's the explanation. Besides, fuel is not too plenty on <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Mulford inhabits just now. As we get near the spot, I shall look out for embers, which may sarve as a light-house, or beacon, to guide us into port." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know {{as he was}} any {{particular}} friend. You see, he asked {{about some of the}} other places around here too--about Jed Wallop's place, and those shacks belonging to Tony Duval, and about the old Hunker cabin and the deserted Parkingham house, and the old Crosby camp, and those shacks down at Miller's saw mill, and <b>a</b> lot of <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> I thought maybe he had an idea of buying some place and locating here." ...|$|R
5000|$|Prior to {{the release}} of Saw VI, actor Costas Mandylor spoke on his character, stating, [...] "Hoffman is sort of torn of {{becoming}} a mad man or becoming a guy that's more composed, coming from <b>a</b> pure <b>place</b> <b>like</b> Jigsaw. <b>That's</b> my character's dilemma; does he go fucking crazy or follow the rules of the boss?". Costas also mentioned that when compared to Jigsaw and his morals, the rough edges of Hoffman are really shown.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{really think}} {{that that would be}} the best way, Mr. Repton. As you say, there will be nothing very dreadful in {{detention}} for a while, with the Spaniards; while there is no saying what may happen here. If you like, I will send one of the consulate servants out, the first thing in the morning, to inquire what ports the Spanish craft are bound for, and when they are likely to sail. They seldom stop {{more than two or three}} days, here. Most of them are taking livestock across for the use of the Spanish army and, though Algeciras would be <b>an</b> awkward <b>place</b> for you to land at because, if detected there, you would be more likely to be treated as a spy; still, in <b>a</b> busy <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> no one would notice a couple of young sailors, and it would be no great distance for you to walk over to Tarifa, or any of the villages on the Straits.|$|R
6000|$|Lemuel was powerfully {{shaken by}} this attack; he did feel {{responsible}} for Statira's staying in town all summer; but {{the spectacle of}} 'Manda Grier publicly crying at his side in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> helped to counteract the effect of her words. [...] "'Sh! Don't cry!" [...] he began, looking fearfully round him. [...] "Everybody 'll see you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{really ought}} to pay, Uncle," [...] {{declared}} Patsy, somewhat nettled by this flaccid reception of her pet scheme. [...] "All the children will insist on being taken to <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> for we shall show just the pictures they love to see. And, allowing {{there is no money}} to be made from the venture, think of the joy we shall give to innumerable little ones!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would need}} four chamber-maids and two hired men {{to take care}} of <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> And think of the money it would spoil to stock it with furniture!" [...] Nevertheless, she gazed at it longingly. [...] "I'd sure like that big garden and that porch. You could sit on that porch and see the mountains, couldn't you? But my ears and whiskers, the expense of keeping it!" ...|$|E
60|$|And as I {{began to}} show {{interest}} {{she went on to}} tell me that Branscombe was, oh, such a dear, queer, funny old place! That she had been to other villages and towns--Axmouth, and Seaton, and Beer, and to Salcombe Regis and Sidmouth, and once to Exeter; but never, never had she seen <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> Branscombe--not one <b>that</b> she <b>liked</b> half so well. How strange that I had never been there--had never even heard of it! People that went there sometimes laughed at it at first, because it was such a funny, tumbledown old place; but they always said afterwards that there was no sweeter spot on the earth.|$|R
6000|$|... "What should I do with Chowton Farm? I shall {{probably}} {{be in my}} grave before the slow lawyer would have executed the deeds." [...] And I in mine, thought he to himself, before the present owner has quite {{made up his mind}} to part with his land. [...] "What would <b>a</b> little <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> do for me? But in my father-in-law's time {{it was part of the}} Bragton property. He sold it to pay the debts of a younger son, forgetting, as I thought, what he owed to the estate;"--It had in truth been sold on behalf of the husband of this old woman who was now complaining. [...] "And if it can be recovered it is our duty to get it back again. A property like this should never be lessened. It is in that way that the country is given over to shopkeepers and speculators and is made to be like France or Italy. I quite think that Chowton Farm should be bought. And though I might die before it was done, I would find the money." ...|$|R
5000|$|White Noises {{surprising}} box-office {{success for}} a movie released on the first weekend after New Year's Day, {{the start of the}} winter dump months and usually one of the worst weekends for new releases, led studios to reassess their releasing strategies for horror films. [...] "The first weekend in January used to be a non-starter for people; we had this little horror movie White Noise that did business, and that has become <b>a</b> <b>place</b> where movies <b>like</b> <b>that</b> tend to operate." [...] Universal chairman Adam Fogelson told critic Anne Thompson during a 2013 indieWIRE panel discussion.|$|R
6000|$|She {{descended on}} Grimsby Center, {{and came back}} {{enthusiastic}} about Miss Mitchin's. She had met the young man with the Albanian costume, and he had talked to her about vorticism and this jolly new Polish composer with his suite for tom-tom and cymbals. She led Father into the arbor and effervescently demanded, [...] "Why don't Mother and you have <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> dear old mansion of Miss Mitchin's, and all those clever people there and all?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{sacrifice}} {{the consideration of}} a great principle," [...] cried Evans, [...] "to the petty effect of a good story on an appreciative listener. I realise your predicament. But don't you see that in establishing and regulating <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> the city of Boston has instinctively sanctioned my idea? You may {{say that it is}} aiding and abetting the tramp-nuisance by giving vagrants food and shelter, but other philosophers will contend that it is--blindly perhaps-- fulfilling the destiny of the future State, which will at once employ and support all its citizens; that it is prophetically recognising my new principle of Complicity?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{ballad of}} Auld Maitland holds in The Border Minstrelsy <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of the Doloneia, or Tenth Book, in the Iliad. Every {{professor}} of the Higher Criticism throws his stone at the Doloneia in passing, and every ballad-editor does {{as much to}} Auld Maitland. {19a} Professor Child excluded it from his monumental collection of [...] "English and Scottish Popular Ballads," [...] fragments, and variants, for which Mr. Child and his friends and helpers ransacked every attainable collection of ballads in manuscript, and ballads in print, as they listened to the last murmurings of ballad tradition from the lips of old or young.|$|E
60|$|They {{fell into}} a cosy and {{mutually}} interesting talk about their separate past, and he gave her glimpses of the life, simple and studious, he had led before he went abroad. She confessed to two mistakes {{in which she had}} mechanically persisted concerning him; one that he came from Charlestown instead of Chelsea, and the other that his first name was Joseph instead of James. She did not own that she had always thought it odd he should be willing to remain in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> Hatboro', and <b>that</b> it must argue a strangely unambitious temperament in a man of his ability. She diverted the impulse to a general satire of village life, and ended by saying that she was getting to be a perfect villager herself.|$|R
500|$|PolyGram and Working Title Films, who had funded Fargo, backed The Big Lebowski with {{a budget}} of $15million. In casting the film, Joel remarked, [...] "we tend to write both for people we know and have worked with, and some parts without knowing who's {{going to play the}} role. In The Big Lebowski we did write for John [...] and Steve , but we didn't know who was getting the Jeff Bridges role." [...] In {{preparation}} for his role, Bridges met Dowd but actually [...] "drew on myself a lot from back in the Sixties and Seventies. I lived in <b>a</b> little <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> and did drugs, although I think I was a little more creative than the Dude." [...] The actor went into his own closet with the film's wardrobe person and picked out clothes that he had thought the Dude might wear. He wore his character's clothes home because most of them were his own. The actor also adopted the same physicality as Dowd, including the slouching and his ample belly. Originally, Goodman wanted a different kind of beard for Walter but the Coen brothers insisted on the [...] "Gladiator" [...] or what they called the [...] "Chin Strap" [...] and he thought it would go well with his flattop haircut.|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} Cynthia, who was walking about the town alone, found herself gazing over a picket fence {{at a great}} square house with a very wide cornice that stood by itself in the centre of a shade-flecked lawn. There were masses of {{shrubbery}} here and there, and a greenhouse, and a latticed summer-house: and Cynthia was wondering {{what it would be}} like to live in <b>a</b> great <b>place</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> when <b>a</b> barouche with two shining horses in silver harness drove past her and stopped before the gate. Four or five girls and boys came laughing out on the porch, and one of them, who held a fishing-rod in his hand, Cynthia recognized. Startled and ashamed, she began to walk on as fast as she could in the opposite direction, when she heard the sound of footsteps on the lawn behind her, and her own name called in a familiar voice. At that she hurried the faster; but she could not run, and the picket fence was half a block long, and Bob Worthington had an advantage over her. Of course it was Bob, and he did not scruple to run, and in a few seconds he was leaning over the fence in front of her. Now Cynthia was as red as a peony by this time, and she almost hated him.|$|R
