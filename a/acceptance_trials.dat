50|$|It was {{considered}} that petrol was unsuitable as a fuel for airships {{intended for use}} in hot climates due to its low flash point. For this reason, R101 was powered by diesel engines, and R100 was originally intended to use engines using a mixture of hydrogen and kerosene. The program to develop the Beardmore Tornado diesel engines was beset with difficulties, the engines being both overweight and unable to produce the expected power output. Similarly, the development of hydrogen/kerosene engines ran into difficulties and so the R100 team {{made a decision to}} use existing petrol-fuelled aircraft engines.

5|$|After {{returning}} from the 1925 cruise, the ship was modernized at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. She had her twelve old coal-fired boilers replaced with four oil-fired models, which were trunked into a single larger funnel. She also had more deck armor added {{to protect her from}} plunging fire, and a short tripod mast was installed in place of the aft cage mast. The modernization was completed in November 1926, after which Arkansas conducted a shakedown cruise in the Atlantic. She returned to Philadelphia, where she ran <b>acceptance</b> <b>trials</b> before she could rejoin the fleet.

40|$|This paper {{initially}} {{reports on}} a usability and <b>acceptance</b> <b>trial</b> {{on the use of}} telepresence robots. The object was to assist the elderly by encouraging virtual social interactions in an attempt to reduce social isolation and loneliness. The trial results were disappointing because the telepresence robot under study had a number of technical problems which meant that the trial had to be abandoned. This has lead us to examine the whole process of building technology to suit a specific purpose (older people at home) versus adapting existing technology to fit into a specific context. To this end, the paper assesses two approaches through the use of two different telepresence robots. We hope this paper can also assist future researchers in this area to be more circumspect in their expectations of the technology. We found that one cannot simply assume that the technology would work and channel all their resources into usability and acceptance testing. It may be the case that a significant amount of effort is needed to get the technology to work in the chosen environment before any acceptance testing can be carried out...|$|R

5|$|The {{large number}} of defects {{encountered}} during flight testing of the MiG-1 forced Mikoyan and Gurevich to make a number of modifications to the design. Testing was done on a full-size aircraft in the T-1 wind tunnel belonging to the Central Aero and Hydrodynamics Institute (TsAGI) to evaluate the problems and their proposed solutions. The first aircraft {{to see all of}} these changes applied was the fourth prototype of the I-200. It first flew on 29 October 1940 and was approved for production after passing its State <b>acceptance</b> <b>trials.</b> The first MiG-3, as the improved aircraft was named on 9 December, was completed on 20 December 1940 and another 20 were delivered {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|The {{maiden flight}} of the unarmed prototype, piloted by M. M. Gromov and without the ATsN installation, {{occurred}} at Khodynka Aerodrome on 27 December 1936.

Gromov reported that the rudder was ineffective and that the outer engines overheated. Subsequent wind tunnel testing identified {{a problem with the}} aerodynamics of the radiators and nacelles. To solve this problem, the outer engines' radiators were moved into deep ducts under the inner nacelles and the rudder was enlarged and redesigned with a smooth skin.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} State <b>acceptance</b> <b>trials</b> were completed, the Council of Ministers ordered the {{aircraft}} into production in December 1946. 50 aircraft {{were to be}} built between January and April 1947, equally split between single-seat aircraft and two-seat trainers, armed with only a single cannon. The trainer ran into serious development difficulties and all the aircraft of the first batch were single-seaters. Fifty of these participated in the May Day flypast in Moscow in 1947. A total of 280 Yak-15s were produced {{through the end of}} the year, exclusive of prototypes. The aircraft were distributed in small numbers to fighter aviation regiments based in the USSR, Poland, Romania, Hungary, and Manchuria for use as conversion trainers.

5|$|One MiG-9 (izdeliye FK) was {{modified}} in 1949 {{to serve as}} a testbed for the Raduga KS-1 Komet air-launched anti-shipping cruise missile. A second unpressurized cockpit was built in line with the trailing edge of the wing for the guidance system operator. The aircraft was fitted with two radars, a K-1M target illumination radar in a prominent bullet-shaped fairing above the air intakes and an aft-looking radar mounted in a cigar-shaped fairing {{at the top of the}} vertical stabilizer. This latter system was intended to test the mid-course guidance system of the launching aircraft and the guidance systems of the missile. Signals from the K-1M radar were received in small bullet-shaped fairings on the leading edges of the wings. The aircraft served in this role for four years, until the missile passed its state <b>acceptance</b> <b>trials</b> in 1952–53.|$|E
5|$|The Tu-70 was {{completed}} in October 1946, but did not make its first flight until 27 November.

5|$|Yakovlev {{was able}} to adapt the two {{existing}} prototypes to the RD-10 with little trouble and one aircraft participated in the August 1946 Tushino flypast. The day after the aerial display, Joseph Stalin summoned Artem Mikoyan and Aleksandr Yakovlev to his office and ordered that each OKB build 15 aircraft {{to participate in the}} 7 November parade in Red Square commemorating the anniversary of the October Revolution. Factory No. 31 in Tblisi was chosen to build the new aircraft because it was still building conventional Yak-3s and could easily switch to the jet fighter. All 15 aircraft were built before the deadline, although they lacked any armour, were provided with an enlarged fuel tank in lieu of armament, and had an incomplete avionics outfit.

These early flights revealed problems with the stability of the aircraft and vibration problems with the new articulated heatshield. It was stiffened before the twelfth flight, but that only partially cured the problem. The first aircraft crashed, killing the pilot, during a demonstration in front of high-ranking officials on 11 July when the attachment lugs of the wing leading edge fairings failed and they hit the horizontal stabilizers. The remaining two prototypes began flight testing the following month, but preparations for the 7 November parade commemorating the October Revolution delayed the start of the State <b>acceptance</b> <b>trials</b> until 17 December. Meanwhile, the horizontal stabilizer of the second prototype disintegrated during flight, but the pilot was able to land the aircraft safely.

In early June, she loaded the personnel from 806, 815, and 819 Squadrons at Devonport Royal Dockyard; 806 Squadron was equipped with Blackburn Skua and Fairey Fulmar fighters, and the latter two squadrons were equipped with Swordfish. She began working up off Plymouth, but the German conquest of France made this too risky, and Illustrious sailed for Bermuda later in the month to continue working up. This was complete by 23 July, when she arrived in the Clyde and flew off her aircraft. The ship was docked in Clydeside for a minor refit the following day; she arrived in Scapa Flow on 15 August, and became the flagship of Rear Admiral Lumley Lyster.
