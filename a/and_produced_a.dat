5|$|A {{series of}} {{fourteen}} films based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories were released between 1939 and 1946; the British actors Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce played Holmes and Dr. John Watson, respectively. The first two {{films in the}} series were produced by 20th Century Fox and released in 1939. The studio stopped making the films after these, but Universal Studios acquired the rights from the Doyle estate <b>and</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> further twelve films.|$|E
5|$|After {{approximately}} five years, Wong Fu Productions garnered 1 million subscribers in 2011. On June 8, 2013, Wong Fu Productions celebrated their 10 year anniversary <b>and</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> 13 minute short on June 29 featuring Christine Chen, the surrounding cast of Wong Fu, and many familiar faces, including Ryan Higa, Dominic Sandoval (D-Trix), Kevin Wu (KevJumba), Freddie Wong, Brandon Laatsch, Joe Penna (MysteryGuitarMan) and The Fung Brothers.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from some}} western troupes' 19th-century visits, the first {{professional}} performance of Hamlet in Japan was Otojirō Kawakami's 1903 Shimpa ("new school theatre") adaptation. Tsubouchi Shōyō translated Hamlet <b>and</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> performance in 1911 that blended Shingeki ("new drama") and Kabuki styles. This hybrid-genre {{reached its peak}} in Tsuneari Fukuda's 1955 Hamlet. In 1998, Yukio Ninagawa produced an acclaimed version of Hamlet {{in the style of}} Nō theatre, which he took to London.|$|E
40|$|A {{system for}} {{encoding}} and decoding data words including an anti-analysis encoder unit for receiving <b>an</b> original plaintext <b>and</b> <b>producing</b> <b>a</b> recoded data, a data compression unit for receiving the recoded data <b>and</b> <b>producing</b> <b>a</b> compressed recoded data, and an encryption unit for receiving the compressed recoded data <b>and</b> <b>producing</b> <b>an</b> encrypted data. The recoded data has an increased non-correlatable data redundancy {{compared with the}} original plaintext in order to mask the statistical distribution of characters in the plaintext data. The system of the present invention further includes a decryption unit for receiving the encrypted data <b>and</b> <b>producing</b> <b>a</b> decrypted data, a data decompression unit for receiving the decrypted data <b>and</b> <b>producing</b> <b>an</b> uncompressed recoded data, and an anti-analysis decoder unit for receiving the uncompressed recoded data <b>and</b> <b>producing</b> <b>a</b> recovered plaintext that corresponds with the original plaintext...|$|R

5|$|Cretton was {{inspired}} to write Short Term 12 based on his own experience of working in a group facility for teenagers. He first wrote <b>and</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> short film {{based on the idea}} and later adapted it into a feature-length screenplay. While Larson and John Gallagher, Jr. won their roles after auditioning through Skype, most of the children featured in the film were cast through open casting calls. Filming took place over 20 days in Los Angeles, California in September 2012.|$|E
5|$|Early in the storm's existence, Narelle brought strong winds, heavy rain, {{and high}} winds to many areas in Indonesia.

5|$|The 1929 {{score as}} revised in 1948 {{forms the basis}} of most modern {{performances}} of The Rite. Boosey and Hawkes reissued their 1948 edition in 1965, <b>and</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> newly engraved edition (B 19441) in 1967.

5|$|The exact date of {{completion}} is unknown but an extreme terminus ante quem is given by the death in 1431 of Pope Martin V, who {{is known to have}} visited the completed tomb; other factors may push the terminus ante quem back significantly into the 1420s. The most reliable such indication is that in September 1428 Jacopo della Quercia returned to Bologna <b>and</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> wall tomb with Virtues reflecting in minute details the Cossa Virtues.|$|E

5|$|Von Neumann {{was asked}} to write an essay for the layman {{describing}} what mathematics is, <b>and</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> beautiful analysis. He explained that mathematics straddles the world between the empirical and logical, arguing that geometry was originally empirical, but Euclid constructed a logical, deductive theory. However, he argued, that {{there is always the}} danger of straying too far from the real world and becoming irrelevant sophistry.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{atmospheric}} {{release of}} radioactive gas followed the Soviet Chagan test of 15 January 1965 in present-day Kazakhstan. Roughly 20% of the radioactive debris {{produced by the}} 140-kiloton detonation was released into the atmosphere, with some fallout occurring over Japan. The US complained to Moscow, but no subsequent action was taken. On 25 April 1966, the Pin Stripe underground test in Nevada (part of Operation Flintlock) experienced a venting malfunction <b>and</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> radioactive plume headed towards the Midwestern US; the AEC determined that the test did not threaten human health.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} Monteverdi {{was in his}} sixties, and his rate of {{composition}} seems to have slowed down. He had written a setting of Strozzi's Proserpina rapita (The Abduction of Proserpina), now lost except for one vocal trio, for a Mocenigo wedding in 1630, <b>and</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> Mass for deliverance from the plague for San Marco which was performed in November 1631. His set of Scherzi musicali was published in Venice in 1632. In 1631, Monteverdi {{was admitted to the}} tonsure, and was ordained deacon, and later priest, in 1632. Although these ceremonies took place in Venice, he was nominated {{as a member of the}} clergy of Cremona; this may imply that he intended to retire there.|$|E

She toured the country, watching cooks {{at home and in}} restaurants and making extensive notes on the regional differences in the cuisine. While in Rome she met the painter Renato Guttuso; deeply impressed by his work, particularly his still lifes, she asked if he would illustrate her book. To her surprise he agreed and, while considering the fee of £60 absurdly low, he kept to his word <b>and</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> series of illustrations.|$|E
5|$|Following System Shock 2s release, and the {{subsequent}} closure of Looking Glass, {{the rights to the}} series had fallen to Meadowbrook Insurance Group (a subsidiary of Star Insurance Company), the entity that acquired the assets of Looking Glass. In 2012, Night Dive Studios were able to acquire the rights for System Shock 2 <b>and</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> digitally-distributable version updated for modern operating systems. Night Dive Studios subsequently went on to acquire the rights for System Shock and the franchise as a whole. Night Dive said that they plan to release the source code of the game to the game community.|$|E

5|$|Henson's 1960s {{talk show}} {{appearances}} culminated when he devised Rowlf, a piano-playing anthropomorphic dog. Rowlf {{became the first}} Muppet to make regular appearances on a network show, The Jimmy Dean Show. Henson was so grateful for this break that he offered Jimmy Dean a 40% interest in his production company, but Dean declined, stating that Henson deserved all the rewards for his own work, a decision of conscience Dean never regretted. From 1963 to 1966, Henson began exploring film-making <b>and</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> series of experimental films. His nine-minute experimental film, Time Piece, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film in 1966. The year 1969 saw the production of The Cube, another Henson-produced experimental movie.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, he {{reconciled}} with Breton, and sporadically attended the Surrealists' meetings in Paris. The same year, he issued the poetry book De nos oiseaux ("Of Our Birds"). This period saw {{the publication of}} The Approximate Man (1931), alongside the volumes L'Arbre des voyageurs ("The Travelers' Tree", 1930), Où boivent les loups ("Where Wolves Drink", 1932), L'Antitête ("The Antihead", 1933) and Grains et issues ("Seed and Bran", 1935). By then, it was also announced that Tzara had started work on a screenplay. In 1930, he directed <b>and</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> cinematic version of Le Cœur à barbe, starring Breton and other leading Surrealists. Five years later, he signed his name to The Testimony against Gertrude Stein, published by Eugene Jolas's magazine transition in reply to Stein's memoir The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, in which he accused his former friend of being a megalomaniac.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, {{independent}} Hollywood producer Robert Lippert {{acquired the}} rights to Caligari from Matray and Universum Film AG for $50,000, <b>and</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> film called The Cabinet of Caligari, which was released in 1962. Screenwriter Robert Bloch {{did not intend to}} write a Caligari remake, and in fact the title was forced upon his untitled screenplay by director Roger Kay. The film had few similarities to the original Caligari except for its title and a plot twist at the end, in which it is revealed the story was simply the delusion of the protagonist, who believed she was being held captive by a character named Caligari. Instead, he was her psychiatrist, and he cures her {{at the end of the}} film.|$|E
