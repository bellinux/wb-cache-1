5000|$|The first <b>analogue</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>system</b> widely {{deployed}} in North America was the Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS). It was commercially {{introduced in the}} Americas in 13 October 1983, Israel in 1986, and Australia in 1987. AMPS was a pioneering technology that helped drive mass market usage of cellular technology, but it had several serious issues by modern standards. It was unencrypted and easily vulnerable to eavesdropping via a scanner; it was susceptible to cell phone [...] "cloning" [...] and it used a Frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) scheme and required significant amounts of wireless spectrum to support.|$|E

40|$|Within 27 {{years from}} 1979 {{when the first}} <b>analogue</b> <b>cellular</b> {{telephone}} <b>system</b> was launched, the Wireless Telecommunication industry has evolved drastically. Its technology and service are now in third generation: 3 G, and already moving forward to 4 G. Within a few years, it will enable the exchange of multimedia contents with huge digital data over the air. In the global market, most countries have deregulation and encourage now free competition. Especially emerging market e. g. BRICS is rapidly growing and intensifying the global competition. Furthermore, {{it seems that the}} internet revolution forces the industry to change their traditional business model entirely. In this situation, wireless telecom carriers {{may not be able to}} survive if they fail to adapt to the new evolved environment. They need developing an appropriate global business strategy, taking into account all complex essential factors: integration with the internet, sustainable disruptive innovation, international technology standardization and market globalization. What framework and method can solve the problem?(cont.) This is the essential question for the industry. In order to answer the question, I believe that any player in the industry has to investigate these dynamics and interrelation each factor has, and design business strategy to achieve sustainable growth in the complex market. In the thesis, as one part of the solution, I propose (i) a hybrid analysis method how to investigate the industry and capture the complex dynamics, and (ii) strategy development procedure to support appropriate business strategy for future wireless communication business. In terms of (i), I introduce three analysis tools: my Triangle Pyramid Configuration Study (TPCS), Porter's Competitive Advantage Analysis and Lessard's RATs Test. Regarding to (ii), I clarify a scheme to integrate these analyses results obtained by (i) for the business strategy development. Finally, I conclude my research by describing essential issues for future wireless telephony business. by Tetsuya Yamashita. Thesis (M. B. A.)

40|$|Traditionally, a {{cellular}} phone has been mainly used to support speech calls camped on a unique <b>cellular</b> <b>system.</b> However, this will most certainly change in the future because of the increase of mobile users, {{the rapid growth of}} data traffic, the idea of a world coverage phone and the needs for Internet services in mobile telephony.

The complexity at {{each one of}} these levels is tightly interrelated. Integrative systems biology aims to obtain a deeper understanding of <b>cellular</b> <b>systems</b> by focusing on the systemic and systematic integration of the different levels of organisation in <b>cellular</b> <b>systems.</b> The different approaches in <b>cellular</b> modelling within <b>systems</b> biology have been classified into mathematical and computational frameworks. Specifically, the methodology to develop computational models has been recently called executable biology since it produces executable algorithms whose computations resemble the evolution of <b>cellular</b> <b>systems.</b> In this work we present P systems as a multiscale modelling framework within executable biology. P system models explicitly specify the molecular, cellular and colony levels in <b>cellular</b> <b>systems</b> in a relevant and understandable manner. Molecular species and their structure are represented by objects or strings, compartmentalisation is described using membrane structures and finally cellular colonies and tissues are modelled as a collection of interacting individual P systems. The interactions between the components of <b>cellular</b> <b>systems</b> are described using rewriting rules. These rules can in turn be grouped together into modules to characterise specific cellular processes. One of our current research lines focuses on the design of cell systems biology models exhibiting a prefixed behaviour through the automatic assembly of these cellular modules.

30|$|Two very {{important}} and active areas of wireless research are multihop relaying and multiple antenna techniques. Wireless multihop relaying can increase the aggregate network data capacity and improve coverage of <b>cellular</b> <b>systems</b> by reducing path loss, mitigating shadowing, and enabling spatial reuse. In particular, multihop relaying can improve the throughput for mobiles suffering from poor signal to interference and noise ratio {{at the edge of}} a cell and reduce cell size to increase spectral efficiency. On the other hand, multiple antenna techniques can take advantage of scattering in the wireless channel to achieve higher capacity on individual links. Multiple antennas can provide impressive capacity gains, but the greatest gains occur in high scattering environments with high signal to interference and noise ratio, which are not typical characteristics of <b>cellular</b> <b>systems.</b> Emerging standards for fourth generation <b>cellular</b> <b>systems</b> include both multihop relaying and multiple antenna techniques, so it is necessary to study how these two work jointly in a realistic <b>cellular</b> <b>system.</b> In this paper, we look at the joint application of these two techniques in a <b>cellular</b> <b>system</b> and analyze the fundamental tradeoff between them.

We show that, for linear highway systems, distributed dynamic channel-allocation schemes perform similarly to the centralized dynamic channel-allocation schemes in terms of blocking probability.
