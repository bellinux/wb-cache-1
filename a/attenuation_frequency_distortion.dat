40|$|Abstract—We model a {{degraded}} {{image as}} an original image {{that has been}} subject to linear <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> and additive noise injection. Since the psychovisual effects of <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> and noise injection are independent, we decouple these two sources of degradation and measure their effect on the human visual system. We develop a distortion measure (DM) {{of the effect of}} <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion,</b> and a noise quality measure (NQM) of the effect of additive noise. The NQM, which is based on Peli’s contrast pyramid, takes into account the following: 1) variation in contrast sensitivity with distance, image dimensions, and spatial frequency; 2) variation in the local luminance mean; 3) contrast interaction between spatial frequencies; 4) contrast masking effects. For additive noise, we demonstrate that the nonlinear NQM is a better measure of visual quality than peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and linear quality measures. We compute the DM in three steps. First, we find the <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> in the degraded image. Second, we compute the deviation of this <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> from an allpass response of unity gain (no distortion). Finally, we weight the deviation by a model of the frequency response of the human visual system and integrate over the visible frequencies. We demonstrate how to decouple distortion and additive noise degradation in a practical image restoration system. Index Terms—Computational vision, human visual system modeling, image quality.

The patches are shunted through resonant circuits featuring a single and multiple resonances. The periodic arrangement of shunted patches provides the beam with attenuation properties which depend on the resonant behavior of the shunts. This article specifically illustrates the effectiveness of periodic shunted patches for passive wave propaga-tion control, and focuses on the application of multi-resonant circuits for the generation of multiple <b>attenuation</b> <b>frequency</b> ranges (bandgaps), which can be tuned to target several struc-tural modes of the beam. A numerical model predicts the attenuation characteristics of the beam for different shunting configurations.

Methods: In present study total of twenty SSD post-lingual subjects with age range of 15 to 40 years. BAHA was programmed with four different settings i. e. without <b>attenuation</b> (WA), low <b>frequency</b> <b>attenuation</b> of 250, 750 and 1500 Hz. Subjective rating scale were used to determine the quality of sound in different condition on brightness, softness, clarity, reverberation, fullness, loudness. Total Time period of 2 hour were given to the subject before rate on the scale so that subject gets habituated to the sounds in which 30 minutes were given to each setting i. e. Statistical analysis and Results: Non parametric test (Friedman Test) was carried results reveal that there was a significant difference in loudness across all experimental conditions tested, indicating loudness decreases as the <b>attenuation</b> <b>frequency</b> increased from 250 Hz to 1500 Hz. Without low <b>frequency</b> <b>attenuation</b> the loudness was higher. This can be attributed to importance of low frequency in perception of loudness. Conclusion: The results from subjective rating scale indicate that there is no deleterious effect on acoustic output quality with low <b>frequency</b> <b>attenuation.</b> But there was significant difference noted in loudness without on with low <b>frequency</b> <b>attenuation,</b> indicating that low frequency gain in the BAHA only adds loudness which is not required for the speech intelligibility.

After a general description of the operation and control of the cycloconverter, the distortion of the output waveform due to low frequency components is discussed. Under these circumstances, the fundamental repetition frequency of the waveform is less than the wanted output frequency, and two methods of determining it for given input and output frequencies are developed. The characteristics and properties of the low <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> components, and the requirements for attenuating them are analysed. The particular effects on the magnitudes of these components due to operation of the cycloconverter in the inhibited mode, rather than the circulating-current mode, are examined and the requirements for attenuating them are identified. It is shown that the communications engineering processes of pulse width modulation and of natural sampling can be identified in the control of the cycloconverter. Regular sampling is more widely used in communications engineering, and its effect on the low <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> components in the cycloconverter output is compared with natural sampling. A modified control method for the inhibited cycloconverter is then developed to attenuate these components. Digital computer programs were written to test the effect of introducing modifications to the control of the cycloconverter, and the more significant results are given in graphical and tabulated form. An experimental cycloconverter, with an inhibition control circuit designed for this project, was constructed to check the validity of the computer programs.

GENERALIZED MODEL OF RAIN ATTENUATION This work is a generalisation of the stochastic dynamic model first proposed by Maseng and Bakken (MB) in [1] and is also inspired by [2] and [3].
