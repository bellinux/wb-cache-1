5000|$|The <b>audio</b> <b>units</b> each hold two back-up {{audiometers}} {{and sound}} level meters which are operated by qualified occupational health specialists. The facilities enable complete hearing conservation programs {{to be created}} for businesses with work environments that have high noise levels. These businesses are {{required by law to}} protect and conserve their employees' ability to hear. In the US, employers must provide preventative measures and protection for employees who experience 85 dB or more, over an 8-hour time weighted average. [...] The <b>audio</b> <b>units</b> also contain fit test equipment so that employees who wear respirators (such as dust masks and supplied air masks) are tested to see whether they are physiologically capable of using the equipment without injury and that the equipment properly fits. There are strict health and safety standards and regulations surrounding the occupational use of Personal Protective Equipment at work including respirators.|$|R
