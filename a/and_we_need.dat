25|$|But, at {{the quantum}} phase transition, the {{localization}} lengths of the electrons becomes infinite (i.e. they delocalize) and this compromises the Fermi-liquid assumption of an inherently free electron gas (where individual electrons must be well-distinguished). The quantum Hall transition will therefore {{not be in}} the Fermi-liquid universality class, but in the F-invariant' universality class that has a different value for the critical exponent. The semi-classical percolation picture of the quantum Hall transition is therefore outdated (although still widely used) <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> to understand the delocalization mechanism as an instanton effect.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the first}} ideas Assis had for the film was to show the mons pubis of a {{waitress}} he knew. Though he was unsure how to include this element, the yellow-colored pubic hair matched the book Tempo Amarelo ("Yellow Time"), by sociologist Renato Carneiro Campos. The title of the film was borrowed from the book, in which the author describes the [...] "rotten teeth of children, the color of poverty in the country".

500|$|The poem {{served as}} a sort of {{opposite}} to the popular idea that The Waste Land {{served as a}}n expression of disillusionment after World [...] War I, even though Eliot never accepted this interpretation. World War II itself has a direct mention in only a few of Eliot's writings. However, World War II does affect the poem, especially with the disruption caused by the war being reflected within the poem as a disruption of nature and heaven. The poem describes society in ways similar to The Waste Land, especially with its emphasis on death and dying. The place is connected to where Eliot's family originates, and, as such, is also the place where his family will symbolically end. In {{the second part of the}} poem, nature is experiencing disorder, and it is suggested that humans too may burn, and also that reason, knowledge, and science cannot save people. The errors of our past become the reasons for war and conflict <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> to become humble in order to escape the destruction. However, darkness consumes the rulers of the world and society. This is, in part, due to Adam's fall, and the resulting concept of original sin. Christ is our savior <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> to seek redemption to overcome our human failings. Eliot states that he has been involved with fighting for humanity and trying to help mankind learn what is important. Only through Christ is man able to be redeemed.|$|E

Languille sent a memo to all Los Angeles social service directors, ordering them to cease referring homeless women to the shelter Vaughan supervised [...] "because of [...] pro-abortion position". Vaughan was reportedly expelled in February 1985 but in April 1986 she spoke to the Los Angeles Times {{to say that the}} Church had closed the case without requiring her to retract her statement. With the help of her superior, Sister Miriam Therese Larkin of St. Louis, Missouri, she retained her position in the order, and Languille's memo was overturned.|$|E

[...] Reyes, who was named man of the match, was frustrated at his missed chance early in the second half, but continued: [...] "I set one up and then scored myself so I was much happier."

[...] Mirkin described Brown's line as [...] "horrible" [...] but because of Brown's reading, [...] "you have something that just sounds perfectly wrong {{and it makes it}} funny." [...] In his book Planet Simpson, Chris Turner describes James Brown's performance as [...] "hilariously over-the-top" [...] and uses it {{as an example of how}} the early seasons of the show would include celebrity cameos and not point out the [...] "enormity of their fame".|$|E

[...] He felt that the fitness of the two squads was the decisive factor in the match: [...] "Today our bench was not very good, with some kids, Liverpool could inject fresh blood at the same time as some of my players became really tired. They were broken. They were in better condition than us, you could see the difference between Frank Lampard and Sissoko." [...] Mourinho was also unconcerned about his team's form heading into the start of the season: [...] "Liverpool had more intensity and pace, qualities that make a team better. They had that and we didn't. We had a big percentage of the ball possession, but Liverpool defended with intensity and looked dangerous when they counter-attacked. I keep saying they are a difficult team to beat and they can go to every game with an ambition to win. They are a good team but over 10 months of competition we will be there." ...|$|E

During the game, he {{impressed}} manager Micky Adams— [...] "He (Myrie-Williams) lifted me, as I'm asking people to be positive and show character, because the fans are disappointed {{with the way things}} have gone recently, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> to give them something to shout about, which I believe he did. I thought he was outstanding, he looked exciting on the ball and he got crosses into the box". In his next appearance for the club, he scored the equalising goal in a 2–1 win at Dagenham & Redbridge, when he [...] "blasted in" [...] a [...] "25-yard blockbuster"– fellow Stevenage loanee Madjo went on to score the winning goal. Myrie-Williams' effort was Vale's first goal in 502 minutes (more than five games) of football. He won a penalty in his fourth game for the club, which was converted by Marc Richards to give Vale a 2–1 win at Hereford United. He returned to Broadhall Way in January having scored one goal in six games for Port Vale, who were unable to extend the loan deal due to an acute lack of funds.|$|E

[...] Within his generally negative review of the episode, VanDerWerff noted that the NYADA mixer scene [...] "features {{some of the best}} work Chris Colfer and Lea Michele have contributed to the show." [...] In contrast, the adult storylines were generally poorly received.

[...] Fallon disparaged Will as being [...] "insufferable", and attributed this to [...] "Morrison's wooden characterization, the stilted writing [...] the flat purpose that the character serves on the show". Sue's storyline was described as nonsensical by VanDerWerff, who wrote that she [...] "has decided to take her crusade against the glee club to a congressional district-wide audience, because, well, she was the most popular character in season one, and she will be again, via blunt force, if necessary." [...] Reiter, however, found Sue to be [...] "in perfect form in this episode, neither too mean nor too misty", and enjoyed her storyline.|$|E
