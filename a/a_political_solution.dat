5|$|According to Israeli {{historian}} Shai Lachman, between 1921 and 1935 al-Qassam often {{cooperated with}} Hajj Amin al-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. They were initially on good terms, and al-Qassam's various official appointments required the mufti's prior consent. He suggests their cooperation increased after the 1929 riots, {{in which one}} source claims al-Qassam's men were active. The two fell out in the mid-1930s, perhaps due to al-Qassam's independent line of activism. In 1933, al-Qassam sent an emissary to al-Husseini, requesting the latter's participation in a revolt against the British. At the time, al-Husseini refused, preferring <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>solution.</b>|$|E

Amidst the celebrations, a suicide bomb attack occurred in the evening {{in front of the}} air force headquarters in Colombo, killing 3 and wounding about 30 people.

5|$|Leclerc heeded {{the advice}} {{he was given}} by United States General of the Army Douglas MacArthur to bring as many {{soldiers}} as possible. He broke the Vietminh blockade around Saigon, then drove through the Mekong delta and up into the highlands. This was possible because Ho feared Chinese domination far more than French colonialism, which he perceived to be in decline. Ho's first priority was {{getting rid of the}} Chinese, and for this he needed French help. Leclerc quickly perceived the necessity for <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>solution</b> to the conflict.|$|E
40|$|<b>As</b> <b>political</b> <b>solutions</b> {{to climate}} change have so far had little impact, some climate change {{scientists}} are now advocating the so-called ‘Plan B’, a more direct way of reducing the rate of future warming by reflecting more sunlight back to space, creating a thermostat in the sky. In this book, Mike Hulme argues against this kind of hubristic techno-fix. Amelia Sharman is impressed by Hulme’s interesting proposals...|$|R

5|$|The English were {{involved}} politically and militarily in Ireland since receiving the Lordship of Ireland from the pope in 1171. The campaign of English republican Protector Oliver Cromwell involved uncompromising {{treatment of the}} Irish towns (most notably Drogheda and Wexford) which supported the Royalists during the English Civil War. The English Army (and the subsequent British Army) remained in Ireland primarily to suppress Irish revolts and campaigns for independence. In addition to its conflict with Irish nationalists, it was {{faced with the prospect}} of battling Anglo-Irish and Ulster Scots in Ireland who were angered by unfavourable taxation of Irish produce imported into Britain. With other Irish groups, they raised a volunteer army and threatened to emulate the American colonists if their conditions were not met. Learning from their experience in America, the British government sought <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>solution.</b> The British Army fought Irish rebels—Protestant and Catholic—primarily in Ulster and Leinster (Wolfe Tone's United Irishmen) in the 1798 rebellion.|$|E

After the end of World War II in Europe in May 1945, he was given command of the French Far East Expeditionary Corps (Corps expéditionnaire français en Extrême-Orient, CEFEO). He represented France at the surrender of the Japanese Empire in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945. He quickly perceived the necessity for <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>solution</b> to the nascent conflict in Indochina, but once again was ahead of his countrymen, and was recalled to France in 1946. He was killed in an air crash in Algeria in 1947.|$|E
