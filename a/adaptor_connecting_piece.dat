40|$|The sperm <b>connecting</b> <b>piece</b> is {{a complex}} {{structure}} that, from a mechanical perspective, appears {{to play a role}} in stabilizing the proximal part of the sperm tail. We report the three-dimensional structure of the intact bovine sperm <b>connecting</b> <b>piece,</b> revealing an intricate, asymmetrical architecture with the segmented columns held together by filamentous linkages. The columns fuse, at the proximal end, with each other into structures that form the centriolar vault, and at the distal end, with the outer dense fibers (ODFs). The grouping of the fibers into these structures is consistent with bending only in the plane of the head. Structures reminiscent of the proximal centriole were observed in the vault, while the association of a novel bar structure with ODFs 3 and 8 organizes the distal centriolar vault. It has been proposed that the elastic compliance of the <b>connecting</b> <b>piece</b> provides the underlying mechanism behind initiation of the sperm beat cycle and bend propagation. According to the basal sliding theory of sperm movement, distortion of the <b>connecting</b> <b>piece</b> may store energy that initiates a new beat. The intersegment linkers could serve as mechano-sensitive elements that regulate alternation of the sperm tailâ€™s bending direction in the beat cycle in addition to providing structural stabilization for the <b>connecting</b> <b>piece</b> segmented structures. On the other hand, our video recordings of the bull sperm movement show little bending of the head with respect to the tail, so it appears that there may be normally little strain within the <b>connecting</b> <b>piece.</b> axoneme, centriole, electron cryotomography, flagella, outer dense fiber, sperm nec...|$|R

The ureteric bud and <b>connecting</b> <b>piece</b> expressed the type 1 precursor chain of ABO antigens mostly early in gestation, the H antigen of the ABO system mostly later in gestation, and cytokeratins detected by PKK 2.
