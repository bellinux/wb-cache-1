5|$|Commercial diving {{operations}} may {{expose the}} diver to more and sometimes greater hazards than recreational diving, but the associated occupational {{health and safety}} legislation is less tolerant of risk than recreational, particularly technical divers, may be prepared to accept. Commercial diving operations are also constrained by the physical realities of the operating environment, and expensive engineering solutions are often necessary to control risk. A formal hazard identification and risk assessment is a standard and required part of the planning for a commercial diving operation, and this is also the case for offshore diving operations. The occupation is inherently hazardous, and great effort and expense are routinely incurred to keep the risk within an <b>acceptable</b> <b>range.</b> The standard methods of reducing risk are followed where possible.|$|E

One of main hindrances against using MASs technology in video games {{has been the}} real-time con- straints for frame rendering. In {{order to deal with}} the real-time constraints, we introduce an adaptation-oriented approach for maintaining frame rate in <b>acceptable</b> <b>ranges.</b> The adaptation approach is inspired from the level of detail (LoD) technique in 3 D graphics. We introduce agent organizations for defining different roles of agents in game AI. The computational requirements of agent roles have been prioritized according to their functional roles in a game. In this way, adapting computational requirements of game AI works as a means for maintaining frame rate in <b>acceptable</b> <b>ranges.</b> The proposed approach has been evaluated through a pilot experiment by using a proof of concept game.

25|$|Electromechanical {{regulators}} called voltage stabilizers or tap-changers, {{have also}} been used to regulate the voltage on AC power distribution lines. These regulators operate by using a servomechanism to select the appropriate tap on an autotransformer with multiple taps, or by moving the wiper on a continuously variable auto transfomer. If the output voltage {{is not in the}} <b>acceptable</b> <b>range,</b> the servomechanism switches the tap, changing the turns ratio of the transformer, to move the secondary voltage into the acceptable region. The controls provide a dead band wherein the controller will not act, preventing the controller from constantly adjusting the voltage ("hunting") as it varies by an acceptably small amount.|$|E
25|$|When it {{had been}} {{determined}} to transfer the Composites to the elevated division of the IRT in 1916, several changes {{were made to the}} equipment. As subway cars, the Composite motor cars were simply too heavy to run on elevated structures. Therefore, they were lightened. The trucks were replaced with the lighter elevated type, and smaller, less powerful motors (120hp instead of 200hp) were installed. As mentioned above, by 1916, 208 of the motorized Composites had already been converted into trailers. When the IRT looked at this, and noted the reduction in power of motor cars associated with using the smaller motors, it decided to convert all Composite trailers to motors in 1916. While this modification added weight to the trailer cars, the load on each wheel was still within the <b>acceptable</b> <b>range</b> to run on elevated structure. Therefore, all Composites became motorized.|$|E
25|$|While {{studying}} {{the effect of}} biodiesel on a D.P.F. {{it was found that}} though the presence of sodium and potassium carbonates aided in the catalytic conversion of ash, as the diesel particulates are catalyzed, they may congregate inside the D.P.F. and so interfere with the clearances of the filter. This may cause the filter to clog and interfere with the regeneration process. In a study on the impact of E.G.R. rates with blends of jathropa biodiesel it was shown that there was a decrease in fuel efficiency and torque output due to the use of biodiesel on a diesel engine designed with an E.G.R. system. It was found that CO and CO2 emissions increased with an increase in exhaust gas recirculation but NOx levels decreased. The opacity level of the jathropa blends was in an <b>acceptable</b> <b>range,</b> where traditional diesel was out of acceptable standards. It was shown that a decrease in Nox emissions could be obtained with an E.G.R. system.

25|$|Boric acid in {{equilibrium}} {{with its}} conjugate base the borate ion {{is widely used}} (in the concentration range 50 - 100ppm boron equivalents) as a primary or adjunct pH buffer system in swimming pools. Boric acid is a weak acid, with pKa (the pH at which buffering is strongest because the free acid and borate ion are in equal concentrations) of 9.24 in pure water at 25Â°C. But apparent pKa is substantially lower in swimming pool or ocean waters because of interactions with various other molecules in solution. It will be around 9.0 in a salt-water pool. No matter which form of soluble boron is added, within the <b>acceptable</b> <b>range</b> of pH and boron concentration for swimming pools, boric acid is the predominant form in aqueous solution, {{as shown in the}} accompanying figure. The boric acid - borate system can be useful as a primary buffer system (substituting for the bicarbonate system with pKa1 = 6.0 and pKa2 = 9.4 under typical salt-water pool conditions) in pools with salt-water chlorine generators that tend to show upward drift in pH from a working range of pH 7.5 - 8.2. Buffer capacity is greater against rising pH (towards the pKa around 9.0), as illustrated in the accompanying graph. The use of boric acid in this concentration range does not allow any reduction in free HOCl concentration needed for pool sanitation, but it may add marginally to the photo-protective effects of cyanuric acid and confer other benefits through anti-corrosive activity or perceived water softness, depending on overall pool solute composition.|$|E

500|$|As {{some critics}} have noted, Psycho-Pass explores {{societal}} and psychological themes, such {{as the price of}} living without stress, and without fear of crime. Indeed, the Sibyl System targets individuals who are considering performing actions that might cause stress to others. But this {{raises the question of whether}} it is morally and socially acceptable to charge individuals with crimes they have not yet committed. For example, in the first episode, a woman is kidnapped, and the resultant trauma causes her Psycho-Pass to become clouded. According to Sibyl's instructions, the police are therefore prepared to kill her. But Akane steps in, refusing to accept Sibyl's verdict, and manages to bring the woman's Psycho-Pass level back to the <b>acceptable</b> <b>range</b> by speaking gently to her. Consequently, this challenges the notion that the potential to commit a crime necessarily correlates with actually committing the crime. According to Anime News Network, [...] "We are all capable of doing bad things at timesshould we be punished because we thought of hurting someone before we act on it? Or because we were victims?

500|$|The Marsh Tacky {{generally}} {{stands between}} [...] high, although the <b>acceptable</b> <b>range</b> is between [...] high. Today, the breed {{comes in a}} wide variety of colors, including dun, bay, roan, chestnut, black and grullo. Historically, multi-colored patterns such as pinto were found, but they were not selected for when breeding, and today are not seen. The colors today are consistent with those of other Colonial Spanish horses. The profile of the breed's head is usually flat or somewhat concave, becoming slightly convex from the nasal region to the top of the muzzle. The forehead is wide and the eyes set well apart. The breed typically has a slight ewe neck, and the neck is attached low on the chest compared to many other breeds. The withers are pronounced, the back short and strong, and the croup steeply angled. The chest is deep but narrow and the shoulder long and angled. The legs have long, tapering muscling, with in general no feathering on the lower legs. The Marsh Tacky exhibits a four-beat ambling gait, most similar to the marcha batida of the Brazilian Mangalarga Marchador, another breed with Spanish heritage, although also compared to the fox trot of the Missouri Fox Trotter. However, the Marsh Tacky's gait shows a period of quadrupedal support where all four feet are planted and diagonal foot pairings, whereas the Fox Trotter shows tripedal support and the Mangalarga Marchador lacks the diagonal foot pairings.|$|E

After the preliminary autopsy was completed, Craig Harvey, chief investigator for the coroner's office, said {{there was no evidence of}} trauma or foul play. On August 28, the LA County Coroner made an official statement classifying that Jackson's death was a homicide. The county coroner stated that he died from the combination of drugs in his body, with the most significant drugs being the anesthetic propofol and the anxiolytic lorazepam. Less significant drugs found in Jackson's body were midazolam, diazepam, lidocaine, and ephedrine. The coroner is keeping the complete toxicology report private, as requested by the police and district attorney.
