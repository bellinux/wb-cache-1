40|$|In {{an economy}} {{dominated}} by agriculture, trade policy reforms and associated changes may induce substantial reallocation of land between more and less erosive uses. However, {{the direction and}} magnitude of such a shift is dif®cult to predict due {{to the presence of}} existing policy distortions and of world market power in agricultural exports; moreover, changes occurring within agriculture may have economy-wide welfare effects through markets for factors and commodities. We use an applied general equilibrium model to evaluate and quantify the likely impacts of an <b>across-the-board</b> <b>tariff</b> <b>reduction</b> in Sri Lanka. In a related analysis, we examine the economic and environmental implications of technical progress in an important export sector, tea. We ®nd that both types of change increase the demand for land in tea, a relatively less erosive sector, and thus have environmental as well as economic bene®ts for the Sri Lankan economy. 1999 Societ...|$|E
40|$|Turkey {{undertook}} a major liberalization of trade {{policy in the}} 1980 s. Import quotas disappeared, the Turkish lira was made convertible, and tariffs are generally lower. Those changes and the export subsidies that remain have removed the anti-export bias from Turkey's external incentive regime. Using a 40 -sector computable general equilibrium model, the authors consider several more trade liberalization options available to the Turkish government. They conclude that uniformity of tariffs and export subsidies would substantially improve Turkey's welfare. Although the"Ramsey"optimal import taxation would call for non-uniform import taxes inversely proportional to the elasticity of import demand in each sector, the observed dispersion of tariff structure in Turkey is inconsistent with optimal departures from uniform protection. In fact, uniformity achieves an extremely high proportion {{of the benefits of}} full trade liberalization because, {{in the absence of a}} general anti-export bias, theprincipal distortion remaining in the trade regime derives from dispersion of the tariff and, especially the export subsidy structure. An increasing number of developing countries - including Chile, Indonesia, Mexico, and Poland - have in recent years undertaken extensive trade liberalization. It is no longer clear that these economies retain an anti-export bias in their trade regime. Perhaps the most important policy conclusion the authors reach is that one must be wary of advocating piecemeal reform of tariffs or export subsidies alone. Piecemeal <b>across-the-board</b> <b>tariff</b> <b>reductions</b> do not always improve welfare; they must generally be coordinated with reductions in export subsidies to ensure improved welfare. The authors counterfactually assume that Turkey's tariffs are at the 1985 level which reintroduces an anti-export bias of import tariffs. In this case, piecemeal <b>tariff</b> <b>reduction</b> to the 1989 level is beneficial. Even small export subsidies are not always beneficial, despite the rule of thumb that small export subsidies are a welfare-enhancing offset to the anti-export bias of import tariffs. Export subsidies in Turkey are highly dispersed, and piecemeal reductions in the export subsidies reduce that dispersion. When the authors counterfactually impose uniformity of tariffs and export subsidies, they note that small export subsidies are beneficial as a piecemeal policy for offsetting the anti-export bias. Policymakers in developing countries have occasionally applied export subsidies in individual sectors with high tariffs as a means of encouraging exports in a sector that may otherwise rely on the highly protected domestic market. The authors show that in Turkey high export subsidies in sectors with high tariffs are particularly counterproductive - because at the multisector level the distortion introduced by the export subsidy dominates the reduction in anti-export bias. Turkey's proposed policy of harmonizing its tariff to the European Community's (EC's) common external tariff would yield only small welfare changes. Harmonizing the EC tariffs will require lowering tariffs below already low levels, in the presence of export subsidies almost as large as the existing average effective tariff rate. However harmonizing to the EC tariff structure can be beneficial if at the same time export subsidies are removed or reduced.

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{international}} trade to alter the composition of domestic production activities allows it to exert an important influence on the environment. Trade liberalization growth has often been associated with high and unsustainable pollution levels, and countries on this path of development are increasingly aware of the environmental risks. This paper uses data on the economy of Korea to appraise the environmental risks of its trade orientation and to evaluate some alternative economic instruments for reducing these risks. Three principal conclusions emerge from this preliminary research, two rather negative and one positive. First, Korea's historical trade orientation has been environmentally asymmetric {{in the sense that}} is occasioned significant transfers of pollution services from its trading partners of Japan to the Korea's economy. Secondly, trade liberalization by Korea is likely to raise both the levels and intensities of major industrial effluents, posing an ever more serious threat to public health. Other things being equal, these effects would be intensified by <b>across-the-board</b> Korean <b>tariff</b> <b>reductions.</b> Third, there is considerable scope within the economy for reducing both the level and intensity of domestic pollution under existing technologies. This can apparently be achieved by economic instrument which change the composition of domestic output, including important tariffs and effluent taxes. Such taxes may lead to reductions in real output, but by significantly smaller percentages than the pollution reductions. We have assessed the relative cost of curtailing pollution with a variety of instruments, including export taxes, specific effluent taxes, and uniform effluent taxes. A combination of uniform tax and tariff removal is simulated to examine the possibility of lowering domestic emissions and raising material welfare simultaneously. Our simulation results indicate that a uniform effluent tax is the most cost effective instrument in abating SO 2 emissions. Our results shows {{that it is possible to}} abate industrial pollution while maintaining or increasing real output when uniform taxation is combined with trade liberalization.

The major countries likely to experience export and production increases are found largely in the northern hemisphere and are {{likely to be able to}} facilitate additional harvests with minimal effects on the forests due to the modest nature of the impact, new forest practices laws, new forest set-asides, and movement toward improved practices designed to achieve multifaceted sustainable forestry.
