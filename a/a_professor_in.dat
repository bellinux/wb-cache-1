5|$|In 1930 Allison {{returned}} to the University of Chicago, where he became <b>a</b> <b>professor</b> <b>in</b> 1942, and the Frank P. Hixon Distinguished Service Professor of Physics in 1959. He studied the Compton effect and the dynamical theory of x-ray diffraction. At the time x-rays were an important means of investigating atomic structures, but the concept that light had both wave and particle properties, as demonstrated by Arthur Compton, was not universally accepted. William Duane from Harvard spearheaded an effort to prove that Compton's interpretation of the Compton effect was wrong, and Allison became part of this effort. Duane carried {{out a series of}} meticulous experiments to disprove Compton, but instead found overwhelming evidence that Compton was correct. To his credit, Duane conceded that this was the case.|$|E
