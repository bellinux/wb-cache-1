Initial public outcry denounced the launching of the operation as the Soviet and <b>Azerbaijani</b> governments went on to defend it, stating that the villagers of Shahumyan were providing aid and harboring the militias in their homes.

Kelbajar rayon, located between Armenia and the western border of former NKAO, was composed of several dozen villages and its provincial capital, also named Kelbajar. According to Russian sources mountain troops from the 128th Regiment (7th Russian Army) stationed in Armenia participated in the seizure of Kelbajar in a blitzkrieg operation.

5000|$|Genetic studies {{demonstrate}} that northern <b>Azerbaijanis</b> are {{more closely related}} to other Caucasian people like Georgians and Armenians than they are to Iranians or Turks. Iranian <b>Azerbaijanis</b> are genetically more similar to northern <b>Azerbaijanis</b> and the neighboring Turkic population than they are to geographically distant Turkmen populations. However, it is also significant that the evidence of genetic admixture derived from Central Asians (specifically Haplogroup H12), notably the Turkmen, is higher for <b>Azerbaijanis</b> than that of their Georgian and Armenian neighbors. Iranian-speaking populations from Azerbaijan (the Talysh and Tats) are genetically closer to <b>Azerbaijanis</b> of the Republic than to other Iranian-speaking populations (Persian people and Kurds from Iran, Ossetians, and Tajiks). Such genetic evidence supports the view that the <b>Azerbaijanis</b> originate from a native population long resident in the area who adopted a Turkic language through a process of [...] "elite dominance", i.e. a limited number of Turkic immigrants had a substantial cultural impact but left only weak patrilineal genetic traces.|$|R
