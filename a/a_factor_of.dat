5|$|Since the 1996–97 season, European Sports Media have {{awarded the}} Golden Shoe {{based on a}} points system that allows players in tougher leagues to win even if they score fewer goals than a player in a weaker league. The {{weightings}} {{are determined by the}} league's ranking on the UEFA coefficients, which in turn depend on the results of each league's clubs in European competition over the previous five seasons. Goals scored in the top five leagues according to the UEFA coefficients list are multiplied by <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> two, goals scored in the leagues ranked six to 21 are multiplied by <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> 1.5, and goals scored in leagues ranked 22 and below are multiplied by <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> 1. Thus, goals scored in higher ranked leagues will count for more than those scored in weaker leagues. Since this change, there was only been one winner was not playing in one of the top five leagues (Henrik Larsson, 2000–01 Scottish Premier League).|$|E

5|$|In aprotic solvents, oligomers, {{such as the}} {{well-known}} acetic acid dimer, may be formed by hydrogen bonding. An acid may also form hydrogen bonds to its conjugate base.

Homoconjugation enhances the proton-donating power of toluenesulfonic acid in acetonitrile solution by <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> nearly 800. In aqueous solutions, homoconjugation does not occur, because water forms stronger hydrogen bonds to the conjugate base than does the acid.|$|E
