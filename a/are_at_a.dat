5|$|Evidence for a virus {{as a cause}} {{include the}} {{presence}} of oligoclonal bands {{in the brain and}} cerebrospinal fluid of most people with MS, the association of several viruses with human demyelination encephalomyelitis, and the occurrence of demyelination in animals caused by some viral infections. Human herpes viruses are a candidate group of viruses. Individuals having never been infected by the Epstein–Barr virus <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> reduced risk of getting MS, whereas those infected as young adults <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> greater risk than those having had it at a younger age. Although some consider that this goes against the hygiene hypothesis, since the non-infected have probably experienced a more hygienic upbringing, others believe that there is no contradiction, since it is a first encounter with the causative virus relatively late in life that is the trigger for the disease. Other diseases that may be related include measles, mumps and rubella.|$|E

Unknown to both, Lad had died in his sleep and the Master and Mistress were crying over his body on the veranda.|$|E

5|$|Brachytherapy for {{prostate}} cancer may cause erectile dysfunction in approximately 15-30% of patients.

5|$|In Virginia, some Carolina wrens populations show {{high levels}} of mercury in their blood and this is {{acquired}} from feeding all-year-round on spiders.

Nest abandonment and failure to raise young were more common with higher mercury content.

5|$|In a {{study of}} a {{district}} general hospital in the UK, 5.4% of all the hospital's self-harm cases were aged over 65. The male to female ratio was 2:3 although the self-harm rates {{for males and females}} over 65 in the local population were identical. Over 90% had depressive conditions, and 63% had significant physical illness. Under 10% of the patients gave a history of earlier self-harm, while both the repetition and suicide rates were very low, which could be explained by the absence of factors known to be associated with repetition, such as personality disorder and alcohol abuse. However, NICE Guidance on Self-harm in the UK suggests that older people who self-harm <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> greater risk of completing suicide, with 1 in 5 older people who self-harm going on to end their life. A study completed in Ireland showed that older Irish adults have high rates of deliberate self-harm, but comparatively low rates of suicide.|$|E

What role schizophrenia has on violence independent of drug misuse is controversial, but certain aspects of individual histories or mental states may be factors. About 11% of people in prison for homicide have schizophrenia while 21% have mood disorders. Another study found about 8-10% of people with schizophrenia had committed a violent act in the past year compared to 2% of the general population.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} how the {{described}} genetic defects increase the Na+/K+-ATPase activity, but it is suspected that the enzyme becomes more active due to increased thyroid hormone levels. Hyperthyroidism increases the levels of catecholamines (such as adrenaline) in the blood, increasing Na+/K+-ATPase activity. The enzyme activity is then increased further by the precipitating causes. For instance, increased carbohydrate intake leads to increased insulin levels; this is known to activate Na+/K+-ATPase. Once the precipitant is removed, the enzyme activity returns to normal levels. It has been postulated that male hormones increase Na+/K+-ATPase activity, and that this explains why males <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> higher risk of TPP despite thyroid disease being more common in females.|$|E

Related to these investigations is the recent development of a test against JC virus antibodies which might help to predict what patients <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> greater risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy when taking natalizumab. While monoclonal antibodies are probably going to have some role in the treatment of the disease in the future, it is believed that it will be small due to the risks associated to them.|$|E

5|$|SCI is {{extremely}} disruptive to sexuality, and it most frequently happens to young people, who <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> peak in their sexual and reproductive lives. Yet {{the importance of}} sexuality {{as a part of}} life is not diminished by a disabling injury. Although for years people with SCI were believed to be asexual, research has shown sexuality to be a high priority for people with SCI and an important aspect of quality of life. In fact, of all abilities they would like to have return, most paraplegics rated sexual function as their top priority, and most tetraplegics rated it second, after hand and arm function. Sexual function has a profound impact on self-esteem and adjustment to life post-injury. People who are able to adapt to their changed bodies and to have satisfying sex lives have better overall quality of life.|$|E
