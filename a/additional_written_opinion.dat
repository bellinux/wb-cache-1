The commission then reconsiders the report after receiving <b>additional</b> <b>written</b> <b>opinions</b> from governments, and the report is being submitted to the General Assembly for approval.|$|R

5|$|In Mississippi Republican Executive Opinion v.

In later cases, the Supreme Court {{is more likely to}} disregard one of its previous judgments that lacks a <b>written</b> <b>opinion,</b> but lower courts must respect the Supreme Court's unwritten summary affirmances as being as equally binding on them as Supreme Court judgments with <b>written</b> <b>opinions.</b> Partially due to Brooks, the constitutionality of the Section 2 results test has since been unanimously upheld by lower courts.|$|R
