The article focuses on the intertemporal law aspects of the case, commenting that the ICJ, while correctly identifying State immunity rules as having a procedural nature, failed in clarifying that whenever their application requires a qualification of the relevant facts, this is to be performed pursuant to the law in force at the time they were committed. Arguably, {{at the time of the}} conflict, the category of jus cogens norms had not yet been sufficiently established, nor had a special regime of State responsibility for international crimes or for serious breaches of peremptory rules of general international law developed yet. Therefore, the supposed prevalence of the breached norms on State immunity rules, which the ICJ has correctly excluded due to the different nature of either set of rules, arguably was to be excluded for intertemporal reasons altogether...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the notion of}} non-point source emission as well as legal methods, procedures, for restoration of environmental damage. It is pointed out that non-point source pollution is generated from several polluters. Joint activity of polluters calls for measures of ecological restoration, instead of tort proceedings. However, non-point source emissions may result in standard case tort provided human health is affected, lives are lost or property is damaged or destroyed. In this article two types of tort proceedings are being examined: those initiated by an action for elimination {{of the source of}} pollution, when the environmental risk is emerging and an <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>compensation</b> of damages, when the damage has already occurred, prior to the action being filed. Further, the author points to the problem of causation given that with non-point emissions each individual act of emission does not cause damage by itself; however it contributes to an emergence of damage in joint activity with other emissions. For these reasons, lawmakers opted for joint and severe liability in cases of non-point emissions...|$|E
40|$|South Africa&# 039;s {{gold mines}} {{are the largest}} and {{historically}} among the most profitable in the world. Yet at what human cost? This book reveals how the mining industry, abetted by a minority state, hid a pandemic of silicosis for almost a century and allowed miners infected with tuberculosis to spread disease to rural communities in South Africa and to labour-sending states. In the twentieth century, South African mines twice faced a crisis over silicosis, which put its workers at risk of contracting pulmonary tuberculosis, often fatal. The first crisis, 1896 - 1912, saw the mining industry invest heavily in reducing dust and South Africa became renowned for its mine safety. The second began in 2000 with mounting scientific evidence that the disease rate among miners {{is more than a}} hundred times higher than officially acknowledged.

40|$|International audienceIn the United States, the Clean Water Act {{requires}} {{compensatory measures}} for aquatic ecosystems damaged by development projects. From the 90 ’s {{to improve the}} quality of the system, we have seen the emergence of a market system to supervise the transactions related to the implementation of <b>actions</b> <b>for</b> <b>compensation.</b> The theoretical framework of neo-institutional economics states that the choice of the organization of a transaction is based on the minimization of transaction costs. These costs are related to the coordination mechanisms that are specific to each type of organization and which efficiency – in terms of transaction costs – depends on the characteristics of the transaction : asset specificity, uncertainty and frequency of the transactions. Transactions related to compensation involve a significant investment in natural capital – the aquatic ecosystem – to produce an environmental gain equivalent in quality and quantity, to the losses related to the damage. The application of the neo-institutional theory to the study of these transactions allows us to show that these transactions have original characteristics that require organizational modes of hybrid forms. The desire to include the compensation in a trading system involves an alignment of the characteristics of transactions with a risk reduction of the specificity of natural capital. Therefore it is necessary to maintain a strong regulatory system to ensure the quality of the compensation...|$|R
40|$|The tort of 'breach of {{statutory}} duty' (BSD) {{operates at}} the intersection of private and public law by providing a civil remedy for those whose injuries were sustained as a consequence of a statutory breach. One of the areas where the tort has clear relevance is the area of work health and safety, with the courts almost invariably holding that the breach of a statute primarily designed to protect workers from injury will provide them with a civil remedy as well as having criminal law consequences. The tort continues to be recognised in this area at the highest judicial level in most common law jurisdictions, including Australia. Despite judicial recognition, the BSD action has been neglected by practitioners and criticised by some academics. This article argues that BSD should be revisited and restored to the lawyers' toolkit as a viable alternative <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>compensation</b> for some work health and safety injuries. In the past 25 years, the law of work health and safety in Australia has undergone a number of dramatic shifts culminating in the introduction of national model legislation in most Australian jurisdictions in 2012.

40|$|The Supreme Court has {{rendered}} {{two lines}} of decisions about the remedies available for {{a violation of the}} Takings Clause. One line holds that courts have no authority to enter anticipatory decrees in takings cases if the claimant can obtain compensation elsewhere. The other line, which includes three of the Court's most recent takings cases, results in the entry of an anticipatory decree about takings liability. This Essay argues that the second line is the correct one. Courts should be allowed to enter declaratory or other anticipatory judgments about takings liability, as long as they respect the limited nature of the right created by the Takings Clause and do not usurp the limited waivers of sovereign immunity for actions to recover compensation from the government. Anticipatory litigation should not be routine. In ordinary condemnation cases and in most regulatory takings cases that turn on the particular facts presented, the action seeking compensation should provide complete and adequate relief. But where remitting property owners to an <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>compensation</b> will result in an incomplete, impractical, or inefficient outcome, anticipatory relief about whether a taking has occurred is appropriate and should be permissible. The Essay argues that recognizing the appropriate role for anticipatory remedies under the Takings Clause would help reduce the many pitfalls of litigating takings claims, and provide more consistent and effective enforcement of this constitutional right...|$|E
40|$|Most inventions in the Netherlands {{have been}} made by employees. Section 10 in the former patent act (Octrooiwet 1910) {{regulated}} the subject. Subsection 1 gave the employer the right to apply for a patent for an invention made by an employee. The employee got the right to compensation for the loss of the patent, however, how to determine a fair amount of compensation was not clearly defined in the patent act. This had two causes: 1 the text of subsection 2 was unclear; 2 the assumption that the parties would have considered the chance of an employee producing an invention in the parties dealings about salary. This assumption is contrary to the reality. Compensation for the employee is coercive law (Subsection 3). Employees seldom bring an <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>compensation,</b> and if they do the courts award low compensations. Thus the costs and the risk of losing the case are high for an employee. The case law of the Supreme Court (Hoge Raad) is unclear: compensation depends strongly on the circumstances of the case. The law in regard to compensation is unjust to the employee, a labour law approach predominates and the employee sometimes receives a supplement to his or her salary. A patent law approach, in which the employee should share in the possible profits resulting from the exploitation of the invention, is rejected. The Dutch government wants to promote innovation and inventions. However Dutch law lacks clear regulation for the compensation of employed inventors. The Dutch parliament clearly expressed the view that all employees in a company should be stimulated to invent during the debate on the new patent act (Rijksoctrooiwet 1995) in 1994. In the new act section 10 Octrooiwet 1910 was changed: inventions made by an employee are owned by the employee; an invention made by an employee with special knowledge, and a research and development contract, belongs to his employer (section 12 subsection 1); an invention made by an academic at an university belongs to the university (subsection 3). The subsections 6 and 7 relative to the compensation hold the same wording as in the former patent act. The goal of stimulating all employees is not achieved, because subsection 5 allows the parties to transfer future inventions in writing. (subsection 5). Subsection 3 is also a violation of the fundamental rights awarded to academics by the International Treaty on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (section 15 subsections 1 and 3), which was ratified by the Netherlands in 1979. The number of European patents pro inhabitant or pro industrial worker in Germany is considerably higher than in the Netherlands. This is a consequence of a special act for employed inventors (Arbeitnehmererfindungsgesetz). An invention made by an employed inventor belongs to him or her. His or her employer has the right to claim the invention if it is a service invention. The conditions for a service invention are: the promotion of the invention by the employer due to providing time, means or experience to the employee; the invention has to be made during the agreement. The employer has to pay compensation for the claimed invention and the employee receives a part of the profits made during the exploitation of the invention. The byelaws to this act make the determination of the amount of the compensation in most cases obvious. Most disputes are settled by an arbitration board of the German Patent office. The justification of the compensation is the employee’s right to share in the monopoly resulting from his or her invention. The incentives to invent provided by the German act, and justice for the employed inventor, are strong arguments for the Dutch legislators to follow the principals of the German act. This recommendation is elaborated as a proposal for an act in this thesis. Technology, Policy and Managemen...|$|E

40|$|The author {{comments}} on the case currently pending before the International Court of Justice between Germany and Italy concerning the jurisdictional immunities of the State in respect of <b>actions</b> <b>for</b> <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> international crimes committed during the the Second World War. The article focuses on the recent case law of the Italian Supreme Court which has affirmed {{an exception to the}} customary rules on State immunity, due to the higher rank of rules protecting fundamental rights of the person. The author contends that the position maintained by the Corte di cassazione is unpersuasive under various respects: first, for inter-temporal reasons, since the notion of ius cogens was not sufficiently established at the time when the offences were committed. Secondly, even if, for the purposes of jurisdictional immunities, regard were to be had to the rules in force at the moment of the judicial action, it is not sufficiently established that ius cogens norms are likely to prevail not just on conflicting treaties, but on other customary rules as well. Thirdly, the said rules are not conflicting, since their object is different: rules on jurisdictional immunities do not prevent the prosecution of international crimes nor the protection of the fundamental rights involved. Rather, they address the procedural aspect of deciding where the action is to be entertained. Subsequently, the article touches upon other issues addressed by the Corte di cassazione in the said case law, such as the availability of universal jurisdiction in respect of actions of the like, the non-applicability of statutory limitations, the effect of the waiver clauses contained in the peace treaties and in the later compensatory agreements, and, ultimately, the existence of an individual right to <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> international crimes enforceable against foreign States. Concerning the latter, the author concludes that either, as it seems more likely, such a right did not exist {{at the time of the}} facts, or, if it then existed, later actions are to be deemed as barred by the said waiver clauses...|$|R

The MIR latency was longer on the affected than the contralateral side (P < 0. 0001). The overall specificity and sensitivity were 99 and 51 %. Our findings indicate that MIR testing, showing an almost absolute specificity, reliably demonstrates nerve damage beyond doubt, whereas the relatively low sensitivity makes the finding of a normal MIR by no means sufficient to exclude nerve damage. Probably, the dysfunction of {{a small number of}} nerve fibres, insufficient to produce a MIR abnormality, may still engender important sensory disturbances.

40|$|Article 230 EC allows any {{natural or}} legal person to {{institute}} proceedings against a decision addressed to that person or against a decision which, although {{in the form of}} a regulation or a decision addressed to another person, is of direct and individual concern to the former. Private parties thus frequently rely on this provision to challenge acts adopted by the European Commission (hereafter the Commission) in accordance with the powers granted to it in the field of competition law. While this particular subject has generated extensive scholarly analysis, the last decade of reforms of EC competition law often cited as the modernisation process makes it particularly necessary to re-examine this topic. Two major developments in the field of competition law give rise to novel and complex questions with regard to judicial review pursuant to Article 230 EC. First, the reforms introduced by virtue of the modernisation of the implementation of EC competition rules have generated a proliferation of new acts whose legal character (and therefore by implication the possibility to challenge these new acts before the European Court of Justice hereafter, the ECJ and the Court of First Instance hereafter, the CFI) is not necessarily clear. This is the case, for example, of the multitude of soft law instruments (notices, guidelines, etc.) which the Commission adopted with a view to clarifying its decisional practice, as well as new binding acts envisaged by Regulation 1 / 2003 such as findings of inapplicability and decisions to remove a case from a National Competition Authority. Second, the increased emphasis on the use of economic analysis following the successive reforms of the rules pertaining to horizontal and vertical agreements and merger control has transformed competition law into a technically complex subject matter whereby economists are stealing a lead over lawyers. The corollary of this development could be to limit the scope of judicial review exercised by generalist EC and national courts. Indeed, faced with having to make complex evaluations involving the weighing up of anti-competitive restrictions and efficiency gains, the generalist judge could quickly find himself lost. Therefore, the more opaque and complex a particular case is, the wider the Commission s discretion in its decision making becomes. Certain recent judgments of the CFI concerning the annulment of Commission prohibition decisions in merger control, however, put this danger into perspective. Apart from the above-mentioned developments, it is equally worth highlighting the proliferation of litigation running in parallel to annulment actions. Such litigation calls for, first and foremost, a re-examination and revision of the fines imposed by the Commission under Articles 81 and 82 EC. Subsequent to successful annulment actions, such litigation also encompasses <b>actions</b> <b>for</b> <b>compensation</b> of the losses incurred by the firm(s) subjected to unlawful Commission decisions. The recent case Holcim v. Commission or the request lodged by Mytravel after the Airtours judgment illustrate the development of such litigation in the field of competition law. Against this background, the developments that follow intend to provide a critical analysis of annulment actions against Commission decisions in the field of competition law in the aftermath of the modernisation process. This study is made up of seven parts. Part II identifies those acts that can be the subject of an annulment action within the meaning of Article 230 EC. Part III reviews and analyses the rules laying down who is entitled to initiate an annulment action. Part IV recalls the modalities <b>for</b> an annulment <b>action.</b> Part V evokes the parallel actions (revision of fines) and subsequent <b>actions</b> <b>for</b> indemnity following an annulment action.
