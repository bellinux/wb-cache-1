In accepting the role, he took a gamble, however, since he had to turn down an offer to star in a big-budget MGM film, The Great Sinner, which would have earned him three times the income.|$|E

25|$|Result: The interviewers {{felt that}} Stephen Higgins {{was the most}} {{impressive}} candidate out of the remaining 3 in terms of entrepreneurship. However, his CV was filled with exaggerations, and he wasn't {{shown to be a}} trustworthy teammate due to his arrogance and his self-preserved agendas. Although he appeared as <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>guy,</b> he didn't come across with a lot of self-esteem. Geraldine was thought to be the most likeable candidate who appeared with the most determination and a good capacity to learn and develop. The problems the interviewers found with Geraldine included her distracting profile in her CV which included spelling errors, and that she didn't seem capable enough to deliver results at the level Bill wanted due to her inexperience. Steve Rayner was described as a world-class salesman. Although he has exceptionally good skills selling face to face, it was argued about whether he could rise to a much more senior position in the field of sales. Steve couldn't prove this in his CV or in the interviews (particularly to David), but it was said that he did come across with the potential to do so. It was also said that hiring Steve would be a risk, because it was revealed that he had problems with alcohol and gambling addictions in his background.|$|E

500|$|Playing {{opposite}} Cagney in Maggie the Magnificent was Joan Blondell, {{who starred}} again {{with him a}} few months later in Marie Baumer's new play Penny Arcade. While the critics panned Penny Arcade, they praised Cagney and Blondell. Al Jolson, sensing film potential, bought the rights for $20,000. He then sold the play to Warner Bros., with the stipulation that they cast Cagney and Blondell in the film version. Retitled Sinners' Holiday, the film was released in 1930. Cagney was given a $500-a-week, three-week contract. In the film, he portrays Harry Delano, <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>guy</b> who becomes a killer, but generates sympathy because of his unfortunate upbringing. This role of the sympathetic [...] "bad" [...] guy was a recurring character type for Cagney throughout his career. During filming of Sinners' Holiday, he also demonstrated the stubbornness that characterized his work attitude. He later recalled an argument he had with director John Adolfi about a line: [...] "There was a line in the show where I was supposed to be crying on my mother's breast... was 'I'm your baby, ain't I?'
