40|$|Epidemiologists have {{unearthed}} a {{good deal}} of both anecdotal and statistical evidence to suggest that Hodgkin's disease might be a transmissible entity. This paper critically reviews those findings which have led to the building of a single-region carrier model capable of making deterministic simulations for the temporal incidence of Hodgkin's disease. The results of fitting this model to the monthly incidence of the disease in Greater Manchester between 1962 and 1976 are discussed in relation to the plausibility of the equilibria associated with the more realistic solutions. In the light of this evaluation, the specification of the model is extended to include multi-region settings with more complex infective mechanisms. Finally, the improvements that <b>acrue</b> from adopting a stochastic modelling style are outlined. Hodgkin's disease carrier models simulations...|$|E

They contain two broad types of plant material: particles codeposited with mineral grains from the estuarine water body, and extraneous debris (stems of indigenous prior plants; post depositional root matter) which is difficult to remove completely by physical means. Treatment with hydrogen peroxide before laser granulometry removes all plant material regardless of kind, drastically reduces values for the mean grain size and median size relative to untreated samples, but has {{little effect on the}} mode, except for a restricted group of bimodal-platykurtic, medium-coarse silts. It is concluded that, in the case of sediments of the general kind examined, no advantages <b>acrue</b> from the treatment of samples with hydrogen peroxide prior to analysis. Although a discrete rather than continuous variable, values of the mode obtained from untreated sediments are suggested to be acceptable for most purposes where a measure of central tendency is required...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the reasoning behind}} the selection and design of a parser for the Lingo project on natural language interfaces at MCC. The major factors {{in the selection of}} the parsing algorithm were the choices of having a syntactically based grammar, using a graph-unification-based representation language, using Combinatory Categorial Grammars, and adopting a one-to-many mapping from syntactic bracketings to semantic representations in certain cases. The algorithm chosen is a variant of chart parsing that uses a best-first control structure managed on an agenda. It offers flexibility for these natural language processing applications by allowing for best-first tuning of parsing for particular grammars in particular domains {{while at the same time}} allowing exhaustive enumeration of the search space during grammar development. Efficiency advantages of this choice for graph-unification-based representation languages are outlined, as well as a number of other advantages that <b>acrue</b> to this approach by virtue of its use of an agenda as a control structure. We also mention two useful refinements to the basic best-first chart parsing algorithm that have been implemented in the Lingo project. 1...|$|E

It has the potential to generate employment and income for the local communities, and promises to protect and preserve the natural and cultural heritage. Tourism, especially ecotourism development, has been presented as a means to alleviate poverty in remote and rural ethnic communities, enhance local quality of life, and protect and preserve the natural and cultural resources of local communities. However, without local community involvement and participation, ecotourism can contribute to unfair distribution of tourism benefits, adverse local expectations, and deterioration of natural and cultural assets in local communities. In this respect, community-based ecotourism is increasingly being promoted as an effective mechanism of the government in addressing poverty problems in (remote) rural poor areas; this is done on the basis of local community involvement and participation in decision-making for, and benefits-sharing <b>acrued</b> from, community ecotourism development. This study examined the ways in which community-based ecotourism has the potential to address poverty issues in two Khmu ethnic communities in the Nam Ha National Protected Area, in Luang Namtha Province, Lao PDR. A mixed-methods approach was adopted to examine local residents’ participation in tourism planning and implementation and to investigate the local residents’ attitudes towards tourism development, including local perceptions of economic, socio-cultural and environmental effects in the identified communities. The study results reveal that community-based ecotourism development was perceived by the locals to have the potential to improve their living conditions and reduce poverty, as well as protect and preserve the environment. This is evidenced in the community that has been involved in tourism development decision-making considerations and benefits-sharing. However, the economic benefits <b>acrued</b> from the community-based ecotourism activities are perceived to be limited in the studied communities to date...|$|R

There {{is a possibility that}} not all information contained in deferred tax expense can be used as detector of earnings management. To analyze that, this study divided deferred tax components into <b>acrued</b> revenues and expenses, employee compensation, depreciation of tangible assets, valuation of other assets, and miscellaneous items. Using the income distribution model (Burghstahler and Dichev 1997) for a 10 year period, we found that the total change in net deferred tax liabilities, total accruals and only depreciation component have a significant impact in detecting earnings management activities to avoid losses. These findings show the importance of deferred tax disclosure for financial statement users – especially in detecting earnings management activity, and also create a new direction in deferred tax study in Indonesia to focus more on the components that constitute deferred tax...|$|R
