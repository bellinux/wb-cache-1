5|$|In {{terms of}} {{prosperity}} and cultural life, the Komnenian period {{was one of}} the peaks in Byzantine history, and Constantinople remained the leading city of the Christian world in size, wealth, and culture. There was a renewed interest in classical Greek philosophy, as well as an increase in literary output in vernacular Greek. Byzantine art and literature held a pre-eminent place in Europe, and the cultural impact of Byzantine <b>art</b> <b>on</b> the west during this period was enormous and of long lasting significance.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, the {{eastbound}} Circle line platform {{was taken}} out of use and the track layout was rearranged to remove the westbound Circle line track and widen the island platform. The eastbound Circle and District lines both serve {{the north side of the}} island platform and the westbound Circle line which was redirected to serve the south side of the island platform. The disused platform is used for <b>Art</b> <b>on</b> the Underground installations, often placed into the brick recesses in the northern retaining wall. In the 1990s a deck was constructed above the District and Circle line platforms on which was constructed a shopping mall and apartment building.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, it {{was during}} the Komnenian period that contact between Byzantium and the 'Latin' Christian West, {{including}} the Crusader states, was at its most crucial stage.

Above all, the cultural impact of Byzantine <b>art</b> <b>on</b> the west at this period was enormous and of long lasting significance.|$|E

The back cover is a maritime landscape, modified to appear as the continuation of the picture on the front and similarly tinted in sinister black and grey colors.|$|E
5|$|The current three vessels {{were built}} in Dundee in 1963 by the Caledon Shipbuilding & Engineering Company to replace the paddle steamers, and were each named after {{prominent}} local politicians: John Burns, Ernest Bevin and James Newman (Newman was mayor of Woolwich, 1923–25). These ferries feature Voith-Schneider propulsion systems for manoeuvrability. A cycloidal propeller is fitted centrally at either end, and each is driven by a 500bhp 7-cylinder Mirrlees National diesel engine.
