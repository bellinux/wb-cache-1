5|$|Wyatt still owned a {{house in}} Tombstone with his common-law wife Mattie Blaylock, but she waited for him in Colton, where his parents and Virgil were living. During the summer of 1882, she sent Wyatt <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>saying</b> she wanted a divorce. She had met a gambler from Arizona and he {{had asked her to}} marry him. Wyatt, who did not believe in divorce, refused. She ran away with the gambler anyway, and he later {{abandoned}} her in Arizona.|$|E
5|$|While {{trying to}} outrun a storm, Harry Potter and his cousin, Dudley Dursley, are {{attacked}} by Dementors, but Harry casts the Patronus Charm to fend them off. Back at the Dursley's, Harry receives <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>saying</b> {{that he is}} expelled from Hogwarts. The Order of the Phoenix, a secret organization founded by Albus Dumbledore, tells Harry that Dumbledore has persuaded the Ministry to let Harry have a hearing. They take him to their headquarters and inform him that the Ministry of Magic is refusing to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned. Harry's godfather, Sirius Black, mentions that Voldemort is after an object {{he did not have}} during his previous attack.|$|E
5|$|Back at Kiamo Ko, Elphaba {{has already}} {{captured}} Dorothy, refusing to release {{her until she}} relinquishes Nessarose's slippers – the only things left of her dead sister. Glinda travels to Elphaba's castle to warn her of the danger and persuade her to let Dorothy go. Elphaba refuses until she suddenly receives <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>saying</b> that Fiyero has died. The two women forgive each other for all grievances, acknowledging they have both made mistakes. To help her in her future, Elphaba gives the Grimmerie to Glinda. The two friends embrace {{for the last time}} before saying goodbye forever, and acknowledge that they are who they are because of each other ("For Good"). As the mob arrives at the castle, Elphaba tells Glinda to hide, and she watches from the shadows as Dorothy throws a bucket of water on Elphaba, who appears to melt away. Grief-stricken, Glinda sees that all that remains of her friend is her black hat and the small bottle of green elixir which she had slept with under her pillow.|$|E

25|$|On another occasion, while staying {{together}} in Brighton, Douglas fell ill with influenza and was nursed by Wilde, {{but failed to}} return the favour when Wilde himself fell ill in consequence. Instead Douglas moved to the Grand Hotel and, on Wilde's 40th birthday, sent him <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>saying</b> that he had charged him the bill. Douglas also gave his old clothes to male prostitutes, but failed to remove from the pockets incriminating letters exchanged between him and Wilde, which were then used for blackmail.|$|E
25|$|There {{is nothing}} to prevent a debtor from having his estate sequestrated by an amicable creditor. The debtor may, for instance, arrange with a friend to whom he owes a debt, and whom {{he is unable to}} pay, that he (the debtor) will commit an act of insolvency. (He will, for instance, write <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>saying</b> that he cannot meet the debt.) The friend will then apply for {{compulsory}} sequestration on the strength of this act of insolvency. An application for compulsory sequestration brought by a creditor who is not at arm’s length is generally referred to as “friendly” sequestration.|$|E
25|$|Jackson's exact birthplace {{is unclear}} {{because he was}} born about the time his mother was making a {{difficult}} trip home from burying Jackson's father. The area was so remote that the border between North and South Carolina had not been officially surveyed. In 1824 Jackson wrote <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>saying</b> that he was born at an uncle's plantation in Lancaster County, South Carolina. Jackson may have {{claimed to be a}} South Carolinian because the state was considering nullification of the Tariff of 1824, which he opposed. In the mid-1850s, second-hand evidence indicated that he might have been born at a different uncle's home in North Carolina.|$|E

25|$|Knuckles {{serves as}} a power-based {{character}} in Sonic Heroes alongside Sonic and Tails, who respectively represent speed and flight. They team up to defeat Eggman after receiving <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>saying</b> that he will destroy the world in three days. However, {{it turns out that}} Eggman is being impersonated by Metal Sonic, whom all of the other characters defeat together. Knuckles helps Sonic, Tails, Amy Rose, and Cream the Rabbit stop Eggman from building an empire in Sonic Advance, Sonic Advance 2, and Sonic Advance 3. With the same team, Knuckles recurs in Sonic Riders and its two sequels; in each game, they participate in board-racing competitions together. In another team-based installment, the role-playing game , Knuckles is a playable character with {{a major role in the}} story. The game begins with Tails informing Sonic that Knuckles has been kidnapped, so a team beginning as Sonic, Tails, Amy, and Rouge must rescue him. He is eventually saved, and it is revealed that the echidna race is still alive in the form of the helpful Shade the Echidna and her villainous tribe, the Nocturnus.|$|E
25|$|Immediately upon {{taking office}} in 1993, Chrétien {{cancelled}} {{the contract to}} buy the EH-101 helicopters and paid a $157.8 million termination fee to AgustaWestland. Additionally, Chrétien kept his Red Book promise of spending $6billion on infrastructure {{to stimulate the economy}} out of recession by signing the necessary orders, and to cancel the privatization of Pearson airport. The consortium that was due to take ownership of Pearson sued for breach of contract, which led the government to settle out of court in April 1997 for $60 million in damages. Chrétien phoned President Bill Clinton of the United States in November 1993 to ask him to renegotiate aspects of NAFTA. Clinton bluntly refused, saying that it had been extremely difficult to get Congress to ratify NAFTA, and if NAFTA was renegotiated, then he would have to submit the renegotiated treaty again for ratification, which was not something {{that he was going to}} do just for the sake of Chrétien. Clinton informed the Prime Minister that he either scrap NAFTA or accept it as it was, and at most he could offer were a few cosmetic concessions like writing <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>saying</b> the United States was not interested in taking over Canada's energy and water. Chrétien chose the latter, and sought to portray Clinton's letter as a major American concession that constituted a renegotiated NAFTA, though in fact Clinton's letter was not legally binding and meant nothing. Only treaties ratified by Congress are legally binding on the U.S. government and presidential letters impose only a moral obligation, not a legal one, on the U.S government.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, the New York State Department of Education sent Trump, Sexton, and Trump University <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>saying</b> {{that they}} were violating state law by using the word [...] "university" [...] when in fact Trump University was not {{actually}} chartered as one {{and did not have}} the required license to offer live instruction or training.

500|$|At {{the age of}} thirteen, Brown {{took a job as}} a paperboy for the Pittsburgh Courier, a black press paper, and {{developed}} a desire to pilot while reading in the newspaper about African-American aviators of the time including C. Alfred Anderson, Eugine Jacques Bullard, and Bessie Coleman. He also became an avid reader of Popular Aviation and the Chicago Defender, which he later said heavily influenced his desire to fly naval aircraft. In his childhood he was described as [...] "serious, witty, unassuming, and very intelligent." [...] In 1937, he wrote a letter to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in which he complained of the injustice of African-American pilots being kept out of the U.S. Army Air Corps, to which the White House responded with <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>saying</b> that it appreciated the viewpoint.|$|E
500|$|On 13 May 1970, Hulme sent Madgwick <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>saying</b> that he (Hulme) would, for the 1970–71 budget, {{be asking}} the Treasurer to cut ABC's budget by $500,000 {{and that at}} least half that cut would be applied to current affairs programming. The letter caused anger and consternation among the ABC's administrators, who felt that the threat {{undermined}} the ABC's independence and authority to decide its own programming. Because Madgwick was temporarily unavailable due to illness, ABC's board of commissioners met with Hulme to protest his intentions. The contents of the letter were leaked by someone in the ABC and received widespread coverage throughout Australia's media. On 27 May 1970, Hulme retracted the letter. That same day, Madgwick and his administrators drafted a letter in response, saying that Hulme's proposal would have been [...] "completely unacceptable" [...] to the ABC. Madgwick followed it up that evening by giving an interview on ABC's 7 o'clock news in which he explained his views on the proper relation {{between the government and}} the ABC.|$|E
500|$|The public {{consultation}} process before the ruling, and the ruling itself were controversial, yielding 229 comments. ILUC {{was one of}} the most contentious issues. On June 24, 2008, 27 scientists and researchers submitted <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "As researchers and scientists in the field of biomass to biofuel conversion, we are convinced that there simply is not enough hard empirical data to base any sound policy regulation in regards to the indirect impacts of renewable biofuels production. The field is relative new, especially when compared to the vast knowledge base present in fossil fuel production, and the limited analyses are driven by assumptions that sometimes lack robust empirical validation." [...] The New Fuels Alliance, representing more than two-dozen biofuel companies, researchers and investors, questioned the Board intention to include indirect land use change effects into account, wrote [...] "While it is likely true that zero is not the right number for the indirect effects of any product in the real world, enforcing indirect effects in a piecemeal way could have very serious consequences for the LCFS.... The argument that zero is not the right number does not justify enforcing a different wrong number, or penalizing one fuel for one category of indirect effects while giving another fuel pathway a free pass." ...|$|E

500|$|Madonna was {{released}} in hardback in the United States in November 2001. It debuted at position 15 on The New York Times Best Seller list, and reached eight the next week, but was present there for only two weeks. Madonna was still livid that Morton wrote the book without her permission, even saying [...] "It's not a well-written book. We all know he wrote it for financial gain and the truth {{had little to do}} with it", after the book {{was released}}. With Jo Whiley from BBC Radio 1, she added that [...] " [...] really went through my Rolodex and that part was really annoying, and I ended up writing him <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>saying,</b> 'I'm not interested in you writing this book, I don't want to have anything to do with it – and please leave my friends alone'." [...] The singer said that she had even sent Morton a book of philosophy—The Power of Kabbalah—to try to dissuade him from continuing. [...] "It's a beginner's crash course in what it's all about – that eventually in some way shape or form it would come back round to him, but he either didn't read it or didn't care," [...] Madonna added.|$|E
500|$|Mary {{was tall}} (5foot 11inches; 180cm) and {{apparently}} fit; she would regularly walk between her palaces at Whitehall and Kensington. In late 1694, however, she contracted smallpox. She sent away {{anyone who had}} not previously had the disease, {{to prevent the spread}} of infection. Anne, who was once again pregnant, sent Mary <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>saying</b> she would run any risk to see her sister again, but the offer was declined by Mary's groom of the stole, the Countess of Derby. Mary died at Kensington Palace shortly after midnight on the morning of 28 December. William, who had grown increasingly to rely on Mary, was devastated by her death, and told Burnet that [...] "from being the happiest" [...] he was [...] "now going to be the miserablest creature on earth". While the Jacobites considered her death divine retribution for breaking the fifth commandment ("honour thy father"), she was widely mourned in Britain. During a cold winter, in which the Thames froze, her embalmed body lay in state in Banqueting House, Whitehall. On 5 March, she was buried at Westminster Abbey. Her funeral service was the first of any royal attended by all the members of both Houses of Parliament. For the ceremony, composer Henry Purcell wrote Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary.|$|E
500|$|Wallace {{had once}} briefly met Darwin, {{and was one}} of the correspondents whose {{observations}} Darwin used to support his own theories. Although Wallace's first letter to Darwin has been lost, Wallace carefully kept the letters he received. In the first letter, dated 1 May 1857, Darwin commented that Wallace's letter of 10 October which he had recently received, as well as Wallace's paper [...] "On the Law which has regulated the Introduction of New Species" [...] of 1855, showed that they were both thinking alike and to some extent reaching similar conclusions, and said that he was preparing his own work for publication in about two years time. The second letter, dated 22 December 1857, said how glad he was that Wallace was theorising about distribution, adding that [...] "without speculation there is no good and original observation" [...] while commenting that [...] "I believe I go much further than you". Wallace trusted Darwin's opinion on the matter and sent him his February 1858 essay, [...] "On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely From the Original Type", with the request that Darwin would review it and pass it on to Charles Lyell if he thought it worthwhile. Although Wallace had sent several articles for journal publication during his travels through the Malay archipelago, the Ternate essay was in a private letter. On 18 June 1858, Darwin received the essay from Wallace. While Wallace's essay obviously did not employ Darwin's term [...] "natural selection", it did outline the mechanics of an evolutionary divergence of species from similar ones due to environmental pressures. In this sense, it was very similar to the theory that Darwin had worked on for twenty years, but had yet to publish. Darwin sent the manuscript to Charles Lyell with <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "he could not have made a better short abstract! Even his terms now stand as heads of my chapters... he does not say he wishes me to publish, but I shall, of course, at once write and offer to send to any journal."Darwin, Francis, 1887, The life and letters of Charles Darwin [...] Distraught about the illness of his baby son, Darwin put the problem to Charles Lyell and Joseph Hooker, who decided to publish the essay in a joint presentation together with unpublished writings which highlighted Darwin's priority. Wallace's essay was presented to the Linnean Society of London on 1 July 1858, along with excerpts from an essay which Darwin had disclosed privately to Hooker in 1847 and a letter Darwin had written to Asa Gray in 1857.|$|E
