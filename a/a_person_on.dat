5|$|In nearby Pohnpei state, Chataan {{produced}} 72km/h (45mph) winds in Nukuoro. The winds {{destroyed a}} house and a weather station. Rainfall on the atoll reached 457mm (18.0in). High winds, surf, and rain also affected Sapwuafik. Rough seas killed <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>on</b> Pohnpei. Crop damage in the country totaled $3million, and overall property damage was estimated at $100million, mostly on Chuuk.|$|E
5|$|Rough seas killed <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>on</b> a Navy Destroyer the USS Goldsborough DDG-20 in Pearl Harbor {{when the}} seaman hit a stanchion, with four others injured on the ship.

5|$|The {{causeway}} {{was originally}} a toll road, and costs for crossing ranged from one penny (1d) for <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>on</b> foot to 6d for a horse-drawn cart. The tolls {{were subject to}} an additional levy of 50 per cent during the night hours. The tolls were later removed, and {{it appears to have}} been Perth's only toll road.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{recorded}} in Rabbi Joshua ben Levi's notebook that <b>a</b> <b>person</b> born <b>on</b> {{the first day of}} the week (Sunday) will lack one thing. The Gemara explained that the person will be either completely virtuous or completely wicked, because on that day (in [...] ) God created the extremes of light and darkness. <b>A</b> <b>person</b> born <b>on</b> the second day of the week (Monday) will be bad-tempered, because on that day (in [...] ) God divided the waters (and similarly division will exist between this <b>person</b> and others). <b>A</b> <b>person</b> born <b>on</b> the third day of the week (Tuesday) will be wealthy and promiscuous, because on that day (in [...] ) God created fast-growing herbs. <b>A</b> <b>person</b> born <b>on</b> the fourth day of the week (Wednesday) will be bright, because on that day (in [...] ) God set the luminaries in the sky. <b>A</b> <b>person</b> born <b>on</b> the fifth day of the week (Thursday) will practice kindness, because on that day (in [...] ) God created the fish and birds (who find their sustenance through God's kindness). <b>A</b> <b>person</b> born <b>on</b> the eve of the Sabbath (Friday) will be a seeker. Rav Nahman bar Isaac explained: a seeker after good deeds. <b>A</b> <b>person</b> born <b>on</b> the Sabbath (Saturday) will die on the Sabbath, because they had to desecrate the great day of the Sabbath on that person's account to attend to the birth. And Rava son of Rav Shila observed that this person shall be called a great and holy person.|$|R
50|$|For persons born {{prior to}} 1900, the month {{identifier}} (third and fourth digits) is increased by 20 (e.g. 952324XXXX denotes <b>a</b> <b>person</b> born <b>on</b> 24 March 1895). Similarly, 40 {{is added to}} denote that <b>a</b> <b>person</b> was born after 1999 (e.g. 054907XXXX denotes <b>a</b> <b>person</b> born <b>on</b> 7 September 2005).|$|R
2500|$|The {{first six}} digits signify the person's {{date of birth}} in the [...] format; for example, <b>a</b> <b>person</b> born <b>on</b> 16 September 1963, would have 630916 as the first six digits of their {{identity}} card. <b>A</b> <b>person</b> born <b>on</b> 1 January 1900 would have 000101 as the first digits, same with <b>a</b> <b>person</b> born <b>on</b> 1 January 2000. In cases where the person's actual date of birth according to the Gregorian calendar is uncertain, the date <b>on</b> which the <b>person</b> first applied for a MyKad is used (which becomes the person's birthday for official purposes), noted by an asterisk (*).|$|R
5|$|Rebound is a two-player volleyball sports game {{in which}} the players, each {{controlling}} a paddle representing <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>on</b> {{either side of a}} volleyball net, attempt to score points. The horizontal paddles are moved by the players left and right on their side of the net, represented by a short dashed line. The ball, represented by a square dot, is dropped {{from the top of the}} screen in a parabolic arc; if it hits a player's paddle, it bounces in another arc according to where on the paddle it hit. Bounces from closer to the center are more vertical, while those towards the sides move mostly horizontally. This method of changing the angle of deflection is similar to the mechanics of Pong (1972), Atari's first arcade game.|$|E
5|$|The {{river otter}} is {{physically}} well-equipped for aquatic life. The ears are short, the neck {{is the same}} diameter as the head, the legs are short and powerful, the toes are fully webbed, and the tail (one-third of body length) is tapered. These qualities give the river otter a streamlined profile in water, but reduce agility on land. The smell and hearing abilities of the river otter are acute. The otter has a delicate sense of touch in the paws in addition to great dexterity. River otters characteristically approach within {{a few feet of}} a boat or <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>on</b> shore because they're near-sighted, a consequence of vision adapted for underwater sight. River otters have transparent nictitating membranes to protect their eyes while swimming.|$|E

25|$|Cunnilingus is an {{oral sex}} act {{performed}} by <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>on</b> a female's genitalia (the clitoris, {{other parts of}} the vulva or the vagina).

25|$|One fatal bear {{attack on}} <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>on</b> the Kodiak {{archipelago}} occurred in 1999. The National Geographic Society filmed a television program about two brown bear attacks. A fatal attack occurred on Uganik Island (November 3, 1999), {{which is part}} of the Kodiak archipelago; the other attack occurred on Raspberry Island, home to two full-service wilderness lodges. Both hunters were returning to game they had killed previously and left alone to go kill another. One of the hunters was killed by the bear and the other, after being attacked, stabbed the bear with a knife, then recovered his rifle and killed the attacking bear. Prior to that, the last fatality was in 1921. Both incidents involved hunters who were hunting by themselves. About once every other year, a bear injures <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>on</b> Kodiak.|$|E

The C-45 struck two houses southeast of the airport, killing the pilot and injuring <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>on</b> the ground.

25|$|An early {{proposal}} for legal rights for animals {{came from a}} group of citizens in Ashtabula County, Ohio.

25|$|The {{origins of}} the cowboy {{tradition}} come from Spain, beginning with the hacienda system of medieval Spain. This style of cattle ranching spread {{throughout much of the}} Iberian peninsula and later, was imported to the Americas. Both regions possessed a dry climate with sparse grass, and thus large herds of cattle required vast amounts of land in order to obtain sufficient forage. The need to cover distances greater than <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>on</b> foot could manage gave rise {{to the development of the}} horseback-mounted vaquero.|$|E
25|$|Heavy {{scrutiny}} {{of the criminal justice}} system occurs when <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>on</b> trial is a political opponent of the executive government. The pertinent question here, which is extremely difficult to answer, is whether the judge presiding over that particular case would have arrived at his decision in a different manner if the accused had not been a political opponent. However, the impartiality of the judiciary cannot necessarily be impugned on the ground that the courts have to enforce laws or rules of evidence and procedure that are felt to be unjust, because even the most independent judiciary must comply with laws enacted by the legislature.|$|E
40|$|There are {{distinctive}} {{modes of}} thinking about politics, three of which are discussed here.

The three modes are illustrated by applying them to concrete issues in a hypothetical manner: Vietnam, bussing, and attitudes toward presidential candidates. The concept of surrogate attitudes is developed and various implications of the theoretical argument are discussed...|$|R
