2500|$|The Bohemian Method is {{a recent}} {{invention}} that involves fire, and was not performed during absinthe's peak of popularity in the Belle Époque. Like the French method, a sugar cube is placed on <b>a</b> <b>slotted</b> <b>spoon</b> over a glass containing one shot of absinthe. The sugar is pre-soaked in alcohol (usually more absinthe), then set ablaze. The flaming sugar cube is then dropped into the glass, thus igniting the absinthe. Finally, a shot glass of water is added to douse the flames. This method tends to produce a stronger drink than the French method. A variant of the Bohemian Method involves allowing the fire to extinguish on its own. This variant is {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "Cooking the Absinthe" [...] or [...] "The Flaming Green Fairy." [...] The origin of this burning ritual may borrow from a coffee and brandy drink that was served at Café Brûlot, in which a sugar cube soaked in brandy was set aflame. Most experienced absintheurs do not recommend the Bohemian Method and consider it a modern gimmick, as it can destroy the absinthe flavour and present a fire hazard due to the unusually high alcohol content present in absinthe.|$|E
5000|$|One {{peculiar}} {{example of}} <b>a</b> <b>slotted</b> <b>spoon</b> {{is used in}} the traditional absinthe ritual. In the beginning of absinthe preparation, a special absinthe spoon helps to flavor the cocktail. The spoon holds a sugar cube above a glass while the preparer pours cold water over the sugar.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>slotted</b> <b>spoon</b> is an {{implement}} used in food preparation. The term {{can be used}} to describe any spoon with slots, holes or other openings in the bowl of the spoon which let liquid pass through while preserving the larger solids on top. It is similar in function to a sieve; however, a ladle-sized slotted spoon is most typically used to retrieve items from a cooking liquid while preserving the liquid in the pot, while table-sized slotted spoons are often used to serve foods prepared or packaged in juices, such as canned fruit and vegetables.|$|E
5000|$|<b>A</b> {{perforated}} or <b>slotted</b> <b>spoon</b> is used {{to dissolve}} a sugar cube in a glass of absinthe, usually to sweeten the drink and counteract its mild bitterness. The spoon is normally flat, with a notch in the handle where it rests {{on the rim of}} the glass. Originating circa the 1870s their use increased over the 1880s and 1890s and were often stamped with brand names or logos as advertising, much like modern alcohol paraphernalia. Sometimes they were sold as tourist items; for example, some might be shaped like the Eiffel Tower, such as the spoon Eiffel Tower #7, which was made for the inauguration of the building in 1889.|$|R
2500|$|The {{traditional}} French preparation involves {{placing a}} sugar cube {{on top of}} <b>a</b> specially designed <b>slotted</b> <b>spoon,</b> and placing the spoon on a glass filled {{with a measure of}} absinthe. Iced water is poured or dripped over the sugar cube to mix the water into the absinthe. The final preparation contains 1 part absinthe and 3-5 parts water. As water dilutes the spirit, those components with poor water solubility (mainly those from anise, fennel, and star anise) come out of solution and cloud the drink. The resulting milky opalescence is called the [...] (Fr. opaque or shady, IPA [...] ). The release of these dissolved essences coincides with a perfuming of herbal aromas and flavours that [...] "blossom" [...] or [...] "bloom," [...] and brings out subtleties that are otherwise muted within the neat spirit. This reflects what is perhaps the oldest and purest method of preparation, and {{is often referred to as}} the French Method.|$|R

50|$|The whey used {{is usually}} a {{by-product}} in the production process of other harder cheeses, commonly that of halloumi or kefalotyri cheese. The whey is gradually heated to 65 C in a large cooking bowl. A small amount of goat or sheep milk (5-10%) can be added at this temperature to improve the end product quality. The temperature is then increased to boiling point, whilst mixing. At 80 - 85 C small crumbly curds of anari start forming and are skimmed off the surface using <b>a</b> <b>slotted</b> <b>spoon</b> or a colander. They are placed in a container that allows further drainage and then cut into cubes of roughly 10 cm sides.Excluding the drainage, the above process takes roughly 1 hour.|$|E
50|$|Place the flour, baking powder, {{salt and}} mace {{in a medium}} bowl. Stir with a wire whisk to combine. Set aside. In a large bowl of an {{electric}} mixer, cream together the shortening and sugar until fluffy. Add the eggs and mix until creamy. Gradually add the dry ingredients, alternating with the milk, mixing on low speed, just until well-combined. Place on a floured board. Work the dough lightly with hands, adding a little more flour as needed if it is too sticky. (This dough should be very soft, something like a biscuit dough, so don't add more flour than necessary.) Gently roll {{the dough into a}} 1/2-inch thick rectangle or square. Using a sharp knife, cut into 2-inch squares or similarly sized rectangles. Heat the oil in a deep-sided pot over medium heat to 375 °F. Carefully add the fastnachts to the oil, about 6 per batch, and fry until well-browned on one side, about 2 minutes. Flip and brown the other side for another 2 or 3 minutes. Remove with <b>a</b> <b>slotted</b> <b>spoon</b> and place on a baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining fastnachts.|$|E

5000|$|Bohemian-style absinth lacks {{much of the}} herbal {{profile and}} density of {{authentic}} absinthe, including the constituents that create the louche.Since this renders Czech style absinth unusable for the traditional method of preparation, a modern ritual involving fire was created. In the “fire ritual,” absinth is poured into a glass, and a sugar cube on <b>a</b> <b>slotted</b> <b>spoon</b> is placed over the glass. The sugar cube is then soaked with absinth and is set on fire. The cube is then dropped into the absinth, setting it ablaze. Then water is poured over the flame until it goes out. Usually, a 1:1 ratio of water to absinth is used. This procedure produces a minor simulation of the louche that is seen in traditional absinthe, and the low water-to-alcohol ratio increases {{the strength of the}} resulting drink. (A traditional absinthe drink is diluted with water to a ratio between 3:1 and 5:1.) Many Czechs do not dilute the drink at all. The fire ritual first appeared in advertisements after having been seen in a Prague bar in the late 1990s. [...] It has been mistaken at times as historical fact due to its having been misrepresented as such in several contemporary costume drama films.|$|E
