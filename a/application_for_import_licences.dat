40|$|This paper {{presents}} a Nash equilibrium model of rent-seeking behavior in which risk-averse players expend resources {{to obtain a}} share of a rent, as for example in contests <b>for</b> <b>import</b> quota <b>licences.</b> Results are obtained relating the equilibrium level of lobbying effort by each player {{to the value of}} the rent. In particular, reduced individual lobbying effort is associated with higher rents contested if players are sufficiently risk averse. The question of whether the value of rents is a good measure of the resource cost of rent seeking is also considered. A simple approximation involving risk and risk-aversion parameters is derived for the proportion of rents dissipated in long-run equilibrium. Risk and risk aversion are seen to reduce the rent-dissipation ratio below unity. Copyright 1987 by Royal Economic Society. ...|$|R

40|$|Mathematical {{programming}} and computers {{have been used}} for several decades to solve complex and long term forest management planning problems. The ever increasing demand on the forest ecosystem to produce wood and other goods and services poses a corresponding demand on a forest decision support system. As a response to meet new requirements the development of the Heureka system was initiated at SLU in 2002 and a first version of the system was released in 2009. Based on a common kernel, a number or applications of the system for different problem areas and users have been developed. The three main applications are made up by an interactive stand simulator, a tool for long term forest level planning containing an optimization module, and a simulator for regional analyses. The system contains models for growth projections, simulation of treatments, estimation of recreation values and carbon sequestration, and habitat suitability. It is also possible to make projections under different climate scenarios. In addition the system includes a number of supporting <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> <b>importing</b> data from different sources, for field inventory, and for comparing and ranking alternative management plans...|$|R
30|$|In 2013, the German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation {{commissioned}} the project ‘Limits of Concern for the Risk Assessment of GM plants’. The {{aim of this}} project is the critical evaluation {{of the concept of}} Limits of Concern introduced by EFSA for the practical implementation in GMO risk assessment. The project is comprised of several work packages, amongst others the evaluation of environmental harm thresholds applied for regulated products other than GMOs, the realisation of stakeholder interviews and expert workshops for feedback and critical discussions on the concept. Within this project, selected GMO applications according to Regulation (EC) No. 1829 / 2003 were scrutinised with the focus on the consideration of the LoC concept. This could be expected because all applications were submitted in 2010 and later and therefore should follow EFSA’s revised ERA guidance. Since no <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> cultivation were available from this period, the focus was put on <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> <b>import</b> and processing only. The GMO dossiers were examined <b>for</b> the <b>application</b> of the LoC concept for environmentally relevant compounds assessed in the comparative safety assessment. Specifically, the application of GM soybean DAS 44406 - 6 was selected {{due to the fact that}} the lectin content in this event, as compared to the non-GM soybean, was significantly different and non-equivalent (notification EFSA-GMO-NL- 2012 - 106, technical dossier, pp 130).|$|R

The aircraft, which were to be {{delivered}} in early 1967, were primarily intended for passenger and freight charters to the Far East and Australia. To avoid paying the 14% tax the British Government had imposed on imported, new foreign aircraft to protect competing British models, the airline needed to persuade the Board of Trade {{that there was no}} equivalent home-grown alternative. It also cited the Board's earlier decision to approve BOAC's <b>application</b> <b>for</b> an <b>import</b> duty waiver on two new Boeing 707-336Cs as a precedent. Despite being offered a mixed-traffic version of the Super VC10 and acknowledging that aircraft's superior passenger appeal, British Eagle favoured the 707-320C because of its greater payload and range. This made the 707 a more attractive aircraft for the kind of charter operations envisaged.|$|R

5|$|The Commercial Import Program {{was created}} in January 1955, {{immediately}} upon the transfer of France's remaining direct influence over the State of Vietnam to the chief of state, former Emperor Bảo Đại and his Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem. The Americans and Diem feared a communist electoral victory and national polls never took place. In October, Diem proclaimed himself {{the president of the}} newly formed Republic of Vietnam after he won a fraudulent referendum, and the aid continued as the US wanted to build a strong and stable anti-communist state in Southeast Asia. When the program was first introduced, it generated turbulence for merchant importers in Vietnam. As {{a large proportion of the}} imports up to that point had been from France, traders who were dependent on selling French products found themselves in difficulties as their wares would now be more expensive than those of import licenseholders who now had access to cheaper American alternatives. The suppliers of French goods threatened to organize a strike, but this never materialized. At the time, South Vietnam was also suffering from a lack of foreign currency reserves and the CIP was seen as an urgent mechanism of remedying this. The introduction of the CIP brought an unprecedented new level of economic liberalism and capitalism, and at first, the entrepreneurial class struggled to meet the challenges of a deregulated market, leading to a series of significant shortages and surpluses of various goods due to their inexperience in judging market forces and resultant imbalances in the economy. Initially 25,000 <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> <b>import</b> licenses were received, many from speculators. In the early years of the initiative, a proportion of the US funding for the CIP came through the proceeds of the sale of surplus American agricultural products to France.|$|R

50|$|From 1930, the {{international}} crisis {{triggered by the}} Wall Street Crash of 1929, also affected Luxembourg and Belgium. Production and exports started to collapse. The crisis inevitably had repercussions for {{the functioning of the}} UEBL, as it provoked a return to protectionism in all countries. Belgium and Luxembourg each put in place protective measures without notifying the other: a quota <b>for</b> certain products, <b>import</b> <b>licences,</b> etc. An economic border was established again between the two countries. The rapid degradation of bilateral relations forced the two governments to start negotiations. On 23 May 1935, a group of treaties were signed in Brussels, which provided a solution to the deadlock. These agreements reaffirmed the principle {{at the root of the}} UEBL, namely free trade between the two countries, an instituted an administrative commission, composed in equal measure of Luxembourgers and Belgians, which became an essential instrument for Belgo-Luxembourgish cooperation. The agreements of 1935 also dealt with a number of monetary questions, and put a cap on the circulation of Luxembourgish currency in the Grand Duchy. During the negotiations, the Luxembourgish government succeeded in obtaining numerous concessions for agriculture in the Grand Duchy. Joseph Bech, who was also the Minister for Agriculture, wanted to protect this sector, which remained one of the pillars of Luxembourgish society (employing 30% of the active population in 1935) and which was the main electoral base of the Party of the Right. However, these protective measures were to postpone necessary structural reforms, and made it all the more difficult to adapt to {{the international}} market.|$|R
