40|$|AbstractThe {{traditional}} payload <b>attaching</b> <b>fitting</b> (PAF) {{does not}} provide any vibration isolation, because of its large stiffness. Whole-spacecraft vibration isolation is a direct and effective approach to assure the successful launching and orbit insertion of a spacecraft. In view {{of the problems of}} stiffness and vibration isolation design, for which the designers care most, the study of whole-spacecraft vibration isolator (WSVI) consists of two parts. In the first part, the stiffness feature of the WSVI is studied with reliability analysis and experimental data. In the second part, the problems induced by stiffness feature are discussed. The simulated and experimental data show that the transmissibility, which is coupled with stiffness, can be reduced by attaching the vibration isolator between the spacecraft and the launch vehicle...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} reduce the {{vibration}} load transmitted from the launch vehicle to the spacecraft during the launching stage, a whole-spacecraft vibration isolating method is advanced by modifying ordinary payload <b>attach</b> <b>fitting</b> (PAF). The core component of the PAF is a kind of damping rod produced by composite material encapsulating metal rubber (MR). In this paper, nonlinear equivalent damping model of the damping rod is built up. By using the model, the stiffness, damping and the transmissibility of the damping rod is studied attentively. Simulation results demonstrate that there exist nonlinear relationships between vibration parameters and the stiffness and damping characteristics of the damping rod. The damping rod can isolate high-frequency vibration as well as restrain the resonant peak effectively...|$|R

50|$|Silicon bronze screws are {{normally}} used in boat building {{but can be}} hard to locate. Brass fasteners are commonly available but apart from being softer and weaker the common brass alloys are much more prone to corrosion through depletion of their zinc content. Stainless steel screws may be used for <b>attaching</b> <b>fittings</b> to the hull above the water line. Type 316 stainless steel is the only stainless steel recommended. Even 316 may get stained with surface rust but this does not penetrate the surface. Staining comes from being in contact with other steels such as the anchor or incorrect cleaning in the factory. Staining near wields should be removed as it can pit. Experienced boat builders are reluctant to use even 316 below the water line in a boat permanently in salt water. This especially applied to long thin fastenings such as screws in boats that have motors. Sacrificial anodes are used to help prevent corrosion underwater but experts will inspect a sample of long thin screws or bolts annually to check for corrosion.|$|R
