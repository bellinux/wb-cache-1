40|$|Background and Objectives: Linear <b>alkyl</b> <b>benzene</b> <b>sulfonates</b> {{are widely}} used as {{surfactants}} in formulated detergent products. Because of their use in household and industrial detergents, LAS is discharged into wastewater collection systems and subsequently entered to wastewater treatment plants. Therefore, {{it is important to}} determine the concentration of LAS with accuracy. They are usually determined by standard method which is time-consuming,tedious and requires great quantities of chloroform. IN 2006 E. Jurado et al proposed a simplified method for measurement of LAS. In the present work the standard method and E. Jurado simplified method was compared economically. Material and Methods: In this work NPV method was used for accounting the cost of initial investment, consumable material, non-consumable equipment and annual cost of staff and finally Net Present Value was calculated for them separately. The rate of interest was considered 15 %. Results: calculation showed initial investment, annual cost of staff and materials for standard method 13351981, 499968 and 1710981 RLS, respectively. And these costs for simplified method were 12048202, 83328 and 58202 RLS, respectively. Finally NPV for standard method and simplified method were equal to 30360709 and 14681848 RLS.

40|$|Background Linear <b>alkyl</b> <b>benzene</b> <b>sulfonates</b> (LAS) are {{the most}} {{important}} ionic detergents that produce negative ions in the environment. These compounds enter surface waters through domestic and industrial wastewaters and cause environmental hazards. Objectives The present study was aimed at assessing the performance of advanced sequencing batch reactor (SBR) in wastewater treatment plant of Yazd, Iran, to remove organic materials and detergents. Materials and Methods The present research was a descriptive longitudinal study conducted on 96 input and output samples of SBR system over eight months from October 2012 to June 2013. The studied parameters were biochemical oxygen demand 5 (BOD 5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and detergents (LAS), which were assessed through standard methods. Finally, the study data were analyzed through analysis of variance (ANOVA) using software package for statistical analysis (SPSS). Results The mean inputs of BOD 5, COD, and LAS to the SBR system were 292. 40 ± 45. 28, 597. 15 ± 97. 30, and 3. 29 ± 0. 92 mg/L, and the mean outputs were 20. 59 ± 3. 54, 59. 34 ± 9. 47, and 0. 606 ± 0. 09 mg/L, respectively. The removal efficiency of BOD 5, COD and LAS were respectively 92. 95 %, 90. 06 % and 81. 6 %. The results of ANOVA indicated that there was a significant relationship between the mean inputs and outputs of BOD 5, COD, and the detergents (P ≤ 0. 001). Conclusions With the proper operation of wastewater the treatment plant and increasing the retention time, the removal efficiency of the detergents increased.

The pilot-plant was operated at influent LAS-C- 12 concentrations between 2 and 12 mg l(- 1) and at sludge retention times of 10 and 27 days. Effluent and waste sludge concentrations varied between 5 and 10 mug l(- 1) and between 37 and 69 mug g(- 1) VSS, respectively. In the sludge samples only 2 - 8 % was present as dissolved LAS-C- 12, whereas the remaining 92 - 98 % was found to be adsorbed to the sludge. In spite of this high degree of sorption, more than 99 % of the LAS-C- 12 load was removed by biodegradation, showing that not only the soluble fraction but also the adsorbed fraction of LAS-C- 12 is readily available for biodegradation. Sorption and biodegradation of LAS-C- 12 were also investigated separately. Sorption was an extremely fast and reversible process and could be described by a linear isotherm with a partition coefficient of 3. 21 g(- 1) volatile suspended solids. From the results of biodegradation kinetic tests it was concluded that primary biodegradation of LAS-C- 12 cannot be described by a (growth) Monod model, but a secondary utilisation model should be used instead. The apparent affinity of the sludge to biodegrade LAS-C- 12 increased when the sludge was loaded with higher influent concentrations of LAS-C- 12. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

This kind of irritation phenomenon represents {{a challenge to the}} sensitive skin of atopic children, despite the many technical and chemical developments in the sector of detergent-production. In this study, the effect of detergent-residue on cotton fabric samples on the skin of children with atopic dermatitis was analyzed in a double-blind test. The 33 evaluated patients wore for the du- ration of 48 hours a cold-rinsed and an intensively warm-rinsed fabric sample on each the right and left ankle. Based on a modified SCORAD-sheet and photographic documentation the clini- cally objectifiable results were investigated before and after the 48 hours. In addition, the amount of detergent residue in the fabric samples was measured quantitatively and compared by use of pH-value measurement of washing solvent and UV-spectroscopy of the anionic surfactants. The analyses showed that with the cold-rinsed as well as the intensively warm-rinsed samples an improvement of the skin-area could be established. The improvement was slightly more marked with the intensive warm-rinsed samples, though not significant. This minor difference was also observed with the alkalinity-detection of washing solvent and in the UV-spectroscopic determi- nation of the linear <b>alkyl</b> <b>benzene</b> <b>sulfonates</b> (LAS).

Meanwhile, LAS removal efficiency (at 80 minutes reaction time for constant concentration of 800 mgL- 1 hydrogen peroxide and 120 mgL- 1 ferrousion) were 69. 38 and 86. 66, respectively, which is consistent with the significant increase in the rate of LAS removal efficiency with reaction time (P< 0. 05).

The result of the experiment indicate that active substance diffusion from oil/aqueous interface to aqueous phase and finally the process of diffusion has a equilibrium in the system with the prolonging of the contact time. At the same time,the value of the minimum IFT {{and the value of}} equilibrium IFT rises with the prolonging of the contact time and has a linear relationship between IFT and t- 1 / 2 when IFT value approaching the minimum and after the minimum, the process is diffusion controlled. The oil and aqueous phase had been analysed by infrared scan and mass analysis, and then the phenomenon have been found that the content of active substance in the oil decreased and the content of active substance in the aqueous increased after alkali had a reaction with compound system. It is proved that the active substances in the oil play a very important role for reducing the IFT. Key words: contact time; diffusion action; alkali; interfacial tensio...|$|E
