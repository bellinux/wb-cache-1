5|$|The ascospores {{produced}} by Polytolypa are , yellow to yellow-orange in color, with dimensions of 2.5–5 by 3–4μm. Viewed {{with a light}} microscope their surfaces appear to be smooth, but under scanning electron microscopy, they are revealed to be densely marked with punctures and small, hard, sharp projections. The structures that produce the ascospores are called asci. In Polytolypa they are numerous, spherical, and measure 9–10 by 12–13μm. Each <b>ascus</b> contains eight ascospores, which are released when the <b>ascus</b> dissolves away at maturity. The anamorph (asexual form of the fungus) resembles the genus Chrysosporium.|$|E
5|$|The spores are {{ellipsoid}} in shape, with {{a smooth}} surface, and contain a large central oil drop surrounded by smaller droplets. The spore dimensions are 32–43 by 25–38μm, the walls measuring 1–3μm thick. Although not reactive with Melzer's reagent, spores stain readily with Methyl blue. The asci contain 6 to 8 spores per <b>ascus.</b> They are variably shaped, with dimensions of 70–110 by 60–100μm, with a stem 10–40 by 6–10μm, and a forked base. Initially about 3μm thick, the <b>ascus</b> walls thin to roughly 1μm when mature. The gleba comprises loosely interwoven, thin-walled hyaline hyphae measuring 5–13μm in diameter.|$|E
5|$|The Ascomycota, {{commonly}} known as sac fungi or ascomycetes, constitute the largest taxonomic group within the Eumycota. These fungi form meiotic spores called ascospores, which are enclosed in a special sac-like structure called an <b>ascus.</b> This phylum includes morels, a few mushrooms and truffles, unicellular yeasts (e.g., of the genera Saccharomyces, Kluyveromyces, Pichia, and Candida), and many filamentous fungi living as saprotrophs, parasites, and mutualistic symbionts (e.g. lichens). Prominent and important genera of filamentous ascomycetes include Aspergillus, Penicillium, Fusarium, and Claviceps. Many ascomycete species have only been observed undergoing asexual reproduction (called anamorphic species), but analysis of molecular data has often been able to identify their closest teleomorphs in the Ascomycota. Because the products of meiosis are retained within the sac-like <b>ascus,</b> ascomycetes {{have been used for}} elucidating principles of genetics and heredity (e.g., Neurospora crassa).|$|E
50|$|Most Leotiomycetes {{grow their}} <b>asci</b> in apothecia (seldom cleistothecia). The <b>asci</b> are cylindrical, without operculum.|$|R
50|$|Taxa in {{this order}} are {{characterized}} {{by the absence of}} a hamathecium (defined as hyphae or other tissues between <b>asci)</b> in a locule, and formation of ovoid to cylindrical fisstunicate <b>asci</b> (<b>asci</b> that have two wall layers that split at maturity in a Jack-in-the-box-like fashion), usually in bundles or cluster called fascicles. During development, the <b>asci</b> push through the stromatic tissue, creating the locules.|$|R
40|$|When perithecia are opened, {{a ball of}} <b>asci</b> folds {{out into}} a 'rosette', with {{individual}} <b>asci</b> attached at the base. Detaching <b>asci</b> and separating them intact from others in the rosette is painstaking and sometimes difficult. However, two procedures have been described for obtaining intact, ripe <b>asci</b> that detach spontaneously and are extruded from the perithecium. This occurs in crosses homozygous for the mutant crisp- 1 (Maling 1960). It also occurs in crosses where <b>asci</b> are formed but the perithecia dry down before ascospores have been ejected (Patricia St. Lawrence, 1958 personal communication). In both situations, individual <b>asci</b> detach spontaneously from the rosette. They remain intact and are extruded when the perithecia are immersed in water. Procedure Crosses homozygous for crisp- 1 : Maling (1960), using cr- 1 allele B 320, found that intact linear <b>asci</b> could be collected in large numbers 3 − 4 weeks after crosses were initiated. In cr- 1 × cr- 1 crosses, <b>asci</b> remain inside the perithecia and very few spores are shot. To obtain <b>asci,</b> a surface layer of agar bearing perithecia is immersed in 10 − 15 ml of sterile water in a Petri dish. Extruded <b>asci</b> settle {{to the bottom of}} the dish, where they can be picked up and placed on the surface of a block of 4 % agar. A fine capillary pipette is used, and suction is applied by mouth through a rubber tube attached to the pipette. Fo...|$|R
5|$|The asci {{are long}} and cylindrical, and taper into a short stem-like base; they measure 300–375 by 14–16µm. Although in most Pezizales all of the ascospores are formed {{simultaneously}} through delimitation by an inner and outer membrane, in S.coccinea the ascospores located in the basal parts of the <b>ascus</b> develop faster. The paraphyses (sterile filamentous hyphae present in the hymenium) are about 3µm wide (and only slightly thickened at the apex), and contain red pigment granules.|$|E
5|$|The asci {{are roughly}} {{cylindrical}} {{with a long}} stem-like base; the entire <b>ascus</b> is often as long as 300–325µm and about 15µm in diameter at the thickest point. The spores are round, smooth, translucent (hyaline), and have diameters of about 12–14µm. They are filled with many small oil droplets. The paraphyses (sterile filamentous hyphae in the hymenium) are enlarged at their tips and filled with brown colored matter, about 4µm thick.|$|E
5|$|The {{red color}} of the fruit bodies is caused by five types of {{carotenoid}} pigments, including plectaniaxanthin and β-carotene. Carotenoids are lipid-soluble and are stored within granules in the paraphyses. British-Canadian mycologist Arthur Henry Reginald Buller suggested that pigments in fruit bodies exposed to the Sun absorb some of the Sun's rays, raising {{the temperature of the}} hymenium—hastening the development of the <b>ascus</b> and subsequent spore discharge.|$|E

5|$|Wynnea {{americana}} {{is distinguished}} from other {{species in the}} genus Wynnea by the pustules (small bumps) on the outer surface, and microscopically by the large asymmetrical longitudinally ribbed spores with a sharply pointed tip. The spores are made in structures called asci, which have thickened rings at one end that are capped by a hinged structure known as the operculum—a lid that is opened when spores are {{to be released from}} the <b>ascus.</b>|$|E
5|$|In ascomycetes, dikaryotic hyphae of the {{hymenium}} (the spore-bearing tissue layer) form {{a characteristic}} hook at the hyphal septum. During cell division, {{formation of the}} hook ensures proper distribution of the newly divided nuclei into the apical and basal hyphal compartments. An <b>ascus</b> (plural asci) is then formed, in which karyogamy (nuclear fusion) occurs. Asci are embedded in an ascocarp, or fruiting body. Karyogamy in the asci is followed immediately by meiosis {{and the production of}} ascospores. After dispersal, the ascospores may germinate and form a new haploid mycelium.|$|E
5|$|Sarcosphaera is {{classified}} in the family Pezizaceae of the order Pezizales. Phylogenetic analysis of ribosomal DNA sequences suggests that Sarcosphaera forms a clade with the genera Boudiera and Iodophanus, and that the three taxa are a sister group to Ascobolus and Saccobolus (both in the family Ascobolaceae). Species in the families Pezizaceae and Ascobolaceae are distinct from other Pezizalean taxa in the positive iodine reaction of the <b>ascus</b> wall. In a more recent (2005) phylogenetic analysis combining the data derived from three genes (the large subunit ribosomal rRNA (LSU), RNA polymerase II (RPB2), and beta-tubulin), Sarcosphaera was shown to be {{closely related to the}} truffle genus Hydnotryopsis, corroborating earlier results that used only the LSU rDNA sequences.|$|E
50|$|In {{many cases}} the <b>asci</b> are formed in a regular layer, the hymenium, in a fruiting body which is {{visible to the naked}} eye, here called an {{ascocarp}} or ascoma. In other cases, such as single-celled yeasts, no such structures are found. In rare cases <b>asci</b> of some genera can regularly develop inside older discharged <b>asci</b> one after another, e.g. Dipodascus.|$|R
40|$|Yeast is {{a highly}} {{tractable}} model system {{that is used to}} study many different cellular processes. The common laboratory strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae exists in either a haploid or diploid state. The ability to combine alleles from two haploids and the ability to introduce modifications to the genome requires the production and dissection of <b>asci.</b> <b>Asci</b> production from haploid cells begins with the mating of two yeast haploid strains with compatible mating types to produce a diploid strain. This can be accomplished {{in a number of ways}} either on solid medium or in liquid. It is advantageous to select for the diploids in medium that selectively promotes their growth compared to either of the haploid strains. The diploids are then allowed to sporulate on nutrient-poor medium to form <b>asci,</b> a bundle of four haploid daughter cells resulting from meiotic reproduction of the diploid. A mixture of vegetative cells and <b>asci</b> is then treated with the enzyme zymolyase to digest away the membrane sac surrounding the ascospores of the <b>asci.</b> Using micromanipulation with a microneedle under a dissection microscope one can pick up individual <b>asci</b> and separate and relocate the four ascopores. Dissected <b>asci</b> are grown for several days and tested for the markers or alleles of interest by replica plating onto appropriate selective media...|$|R
500|$|The spores are {{ellipsoid}} or sausage-shaped (...) , smooth, and thin-walled. They are non-amyloid (not {{taking up}} iodine stain), and hyaline (translucent), with dimensions of 22–37 by 10–15µm. The spore-bearing cells, the <b>asci</b> are eight-spored, cylindrical, and measure 600 by 15–17µm. They are operculate, analogous {{to having a}} flip-top lid mechanism to release the spores. Interspersed among the <b>asci</b> are thin, filamentous, branched paraphyses that extend beyond {{the tops of the}} <b>asci.</b>|$|R
5|$|The asci are 400–500 by 12–14µm, cylindrical, and operculate. The ascospores are {{elliptical}} to cylindrical with rounded ends, uniseriate, hyaline, {{and measure}} 26–40 by 10–12µm. They contain two large oil drops at either end; the oil drops are useful taxonomic characters {{that may be}} used to help distinguish S.dudleyi from some other Sarcoscypha species. The spores are covered with a sheath of mucilage, which typically causes the eight spores of the <b>ascus</b> to be ejected together. The paraphyses (sterile filamentous hyphal end cells in the hymenium) are slender, slightly enlarged above, and contain numerous red granules. The granules contain carotenoid pigments such as plectaniaxanthine or beta carotene, and give the fruit body its color.|$|E
5|$|The spores are {{smooth and}} cylindrical, {{sometimes}} {{with a slight}} swelling in the middle, and sometimes slightly curved; they measure 59–65 by 4–5µm. G.glutinosum spores have between two and seven septa, although three is most typical in mature specimens. The thin-walled asci (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical to narrowly club-shaped, eight-spored, and typically measure 200–265µm long by 12–16µm wide. Ascospores occupy about the upper two-thirds to three-quarters of the <b>ascus,</b> leaving a hyaline (transparent) base. The paraphyses, hyaline at the base and brown in the upper regions, are 4–11µm wide, and longer than the asci. Cells {{at the end of}} the paraphyses are pear-shaped (piriform) or spherical, brownish, and measure 8–10µm wide. The sticky material on the stipe is a gelatinous matrix made of a layer of paraphyses.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies were}} first {{collected}} in Austin, Texas, and the species was named Urnula geaster in 1893; {{later it was}} found in Kyushu in 1937, but the mushroom was not reported again in Japan until 1973. Although the new genus Chorioactis was proposed to accommodate the unique species {{a few years after}} its original discovery, it was not until 1968 that it was accepted as a valid genus. Its classification has also been a source of confusion. Historically, Chorioactis was placed in the fungus family Sarcosomataceae, despite inconsistencies in the microscopic structure of the <b>ascus,</b> the saclike structure in which spores are formed. Phylogenetic analyses of the past decade have clarified the fungus's classification: Chorioactis, along with three other genera, make up the family Chorioactidaceae, a grouping of related fungi formally acknowledged in 2008. In 2009, Japanese researchers reported discovering a form of the fungus missing the sexual stage of its life cycle; this asexual state was named Kumanasamuha geaster.|$|E
50|$|The spores are 20-30 by 14-16 µm; the <b>asci</b> (spore-bearing cells) are 300-350 by 18-20 µm. The paraphyses (sterile, upright, basally {{attached}} filaments in the hymenium, growing between <b>asci)</b> are thin, slightly thickened {{at the tip}} {{and contain}} many red granules.|$|R

25|$|A {{hymenium}} is a {{layer of}} microscopic spore-bearing cells that covers the surface of gills. In the nongilled mushrooms, the hymenium lines the inner surfaces of the tubes of boletes and polypores, or covers the teeth of spine fungi and the branches of corals. In the Ascomycota, spores develop within microscopic elongated, sac-like cells called asci, which typically contain eight spores in each <b>ascus.</b> The Discomycetes, which contain the cup, sponge, brain, and some club-like fungi, develop an exposed layer of asci, as on the inner surfaces of cup fungi or within the pits of morels. The Pyrenomycetes, tiny dark-colored fungi that live {{on a wide range}} of substrates including soil, dung, leaf litter, and decaying wood, as well as other fungi, produce minute, flask-shaped structures called perithecia, within which the asci develop.|$|E

500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Engleromyces sinensis form two roughly spherical lobes that {{partially}} envelop the bamboo substrate. The official description gives dimensions of [...] by [...] and [...] in height, although specimens in markets measuring [...] in diameter have been noted. When young, {{the surface is}} buff-colored with a pinkish hue and slightly dimpled surface; the color changes to grayish-brown and the surface becomes smoother as the fungus matures. The internal flesh is buff colored, with a firm texture that later becomes woody. The ostioles (minute openings through which spores are released), which are scattered about {{the surface of the}} fruit bodies, are somewhat nipple-like when young but later become sharper (punctate). Situated under a crust with a thickness of about 1mm, the perithecia are arranged in rows. They are spherical to flask shaped, with eight-spored asci. The asci are funnel or T-shaped, somewhat like a golf tee, and measure about 4 by 4µm. They have an apical apparatus (a region at the <b>ascus</b> tip that forms the spore-shooting mechanism) that stains blue in Melzer's reagent.
