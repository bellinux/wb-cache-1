2500|$|Resorcinol {{crystallizes}} from benzene as colorless needles {{that are}} readily soluble in water, alcohol, and ether, but insoluble in chloroform and carbon disulfide. It reduces Fehling's solution and ammoniacal silver solutions. It does not form a precipitate with lead acetate solution, {{as does the}} isomeric pyrocatechol. Iron(III) chloride colors its aqueous solution a dark-violet, and bromine water precipitates tribromoresorcin. These properties are what give it its use as <b>a</b> <b>colouring</b> <b>agent</b> for certain chromatography experiments. Sodium amalgam reduces it to dihydroresorcin, which when heated to 150 to 160°C with concentrated barium hydroxide solution gives γ-acetylbutyric acid (D. Vorlgnder); when fused with potassium hydroxide, resorcinol yields phloroglucin, pyrocatechol, and diresorcin. It condenses with acids or acid chlorides, {{in the presence of}} dehydrating agents, to oxyketones, e.g., with zinc chloride and glacial acetic acid at 145°C it yields resacetophenone (HO)2C6H3~CO.CH3. With the anhydrides of dibasic acids, it yields fluoresceins. When heated with calcium chloride—ammonia to 200°C it yields meta-dioxydiphenylamine. With sodium nitrite it forms a water-soluble blue dye, which is turned red by acids, and is used as an indicator, under the name of lacmoid. [...] It condenses readily with aldehydes, yielding with formaldehyde, on the addition of catalytic hydrochloric acid, methylene diresorcin 2•CH2. Reaction with chloral hydrate in the presence of potassium bisulfate yields the lactone of tetra-oxydiphenyl methane carboxylic acid. In alcoholic solution it condenses with sodium acetoacetate to form 4-methylumbelliferone.|$|E

50|$|Colours, {{techniques}} and materials vary {{depending upon the}} look a glassmaker is trying to achieve. Aquamarine is created {{through the use of}} copper and cobalt compounds, whereas ruby red uses a gold solution as <b>a</b> <b>colouring</b> <b>agent.</b> Murrine technique begins with the layering of coloured liquid glass, which is then stretched into long rods called canes (caneworking) different color canes are then arranged in a mold to form a design. Then they are heated to fusing temperatures and when fused then pulled (stretched) again like Taffy to reduce diameters. Then when cold, these canes are then sliced in cross-section, which show a layered pattern. The better-known term millefiori is a way of using lots of sliced murrine that being picked up from the marver by a gather of hot molten glass. When the amalgam of this type of murrine shows the likeness of many flowers, thus mille (thousand) fiori (flowers). Filigree (a type of caneworking), incalmo, enamel painted, glass engraving, gold engraving, lattimo, ribbed glass and submersion {{are just a few of}} the other techniques a glassmaker can employ many of which have not changed since Roman times (the Romans promoted their glass industry wherever they went).|$|E

40|$|A novel {{design and}} {{implementation}} of a single-chip wavelength tunable light emitting diode (LED) is introduced in this paper, with varying emission spectral characteristics ranging between 470 nm (blue) and 525 nm (green). The emission wavelength of green fluorescent microspheres (525 nm), acting as <b>a</b> <b>colour</b> conversion <b>agent,</b> is chosen to be efficiently excited by a GaN LED of 470 nm. It is selectively-coated onto designated micrometer-scaled pixels, which are interconnected via metal lines.

Since the pixels are of micronscale which are non-resolvable by the unaided human eye, the output appears optically mixed.

It is possible to remove upto 6. 42 % of the volatile substances from the annatto. Then different solvents were put on trial and error basis to get the optimum extract of bixin color.

We show that acute exposure of Caco- 2 cells to both anatase (12 nm) and rutile (20 nm) TiO 2 -NPs induce early upregulation of a battery of efflux pumps and nutrient transporters. In addition they cause overproduction of reactive oxygen species and misbalance redox repair systems, without inducing cell mortality or DNA damage.
