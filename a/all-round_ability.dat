25|$|Colin Cowdrey {{arrived in}} Perth with {{the wives of}} the MCC team after a 19-hour delay in Bombay, too late to play a {{practice}} match and he was called up for the Second Test two days after he arrived and with three hours in the nets. This was his sixth tour of Australia matching {{the record of the}} Lancashire spinner Johnny Briggs. Frank Tyson, who had played with Cowdrey in the 1954-55 Ashes series and now commentating for the ABC was jokingly asked by fans if he would be recalled as well. The tour selectors were limited by the hand injuries to John Edrich and Dennis Amiss, but David Lloyd's finger had mended and he was called up to open the innings. Fletcher had a numb forearm after being hit by a Lillee bouncer in Brisbane and again by Alan Smith in the nets and was 'absent hurt' in the match against Western Australia, but had now recovered and kept his place. Peter Lever had a side strain and Mike Hendrick a fever and they were replaced by Chris Old and Geoff Arnold. More surprisingly Derek Underwood was replaced by the veteran Fred Titmus. Underwood had bowled some excellent balls in the First Test, but the WACA was a fast, true pitch with little turn and Titmus's ability to flight the ball was seen as an advantage, and his <b>all-round</b> <b>ability</b> would strengthen the fragile batting line up. The task of the Australian selectors was easier as they kept the same XI from Brisbane, but exchanged the twelfth man Kerry O'Keeffe for the off-spinner Ashley Mallett. Like Titmus Mallett was able to flight the ball, so Terry Jenner was made twelfth man and Mallett played. Ian Chappell won the toss and took the extraordinary decision to field, believing that the England batsmen were still demoralised from their experience at Brisbane and that a dose of fast bowling on the quickest pitch in Australia might break them. Also there was some moisture in the air which would help his swing bowlers. Only twice had a captain put the opposition into bat and won in Australia, Johnny Douglas in the Fourth Test of the 1911–12 Ashes series and Richie Benaud in the Fifth Test of the 1958–59 Ashes series, both at the MCG.|$|E

25|$|Mitchell {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Transvaal, against Border, {{at the age}} of 17. He took 11 wickets with his legbreaks and googlies. It was only later in the following season that he started to develop his batting. In 1927–28 the MCC toured South Africa and Mitchell, batting at 3, struck 40 runs. He showcased his <b>all-round</b> <b>abilities</b> against Natal in the 1928–29 trial matches and later in a game against Griqualand West he showed his fighting spirit by rescuing his side after the top six batsmen scored no more than 11 runs between them. His maiden first-class century came in England, against the successful Yorkshire side at Sheffield. For most of the games {{in the rest of the}} tour he opened the batting and it would be a position that he would stay in for most of his career.|$|R

The university also offers extracurricular activities to enrich campus life; these are organized by student societies and associations in fields including science and technology, art, sports, environmental protection and politics. Some groups have become influential, including the Society of Scientific Exploration and Wilderness Survival and the Association of Beijing College Volunteers for Environmental Protection. The former received the Prize of the Earth, the top prize from the National Bureau of Environmental Protection. In recent years, BFU students of BFU won four consecutive prizes at the College Students' Landscape Gardening Architecture Design Competitions (sponsored by UNESCO and the International Association of Landscape Gardening Architects), the Golden Prize in International College Students' Architecture Design and prizes in garden-design competitions.

500|$|Leaving St Peter's School, Yardley went to St John's College, Cambridge University, {{where he}} {{immediately}} began to show <b>all-round</b> <b>ability</b> at sports. He won the North of England Squash Championships every year between 1934 and 1939, and won his Blue in hockey, squash, and Rugby Fives. However, his main distinction came from cricket, {{where he was a}} Blue in each his four years at Cambridge. He played for the University team in his first year, the 1935 season, making ten first-class appearances without much success. His Wisden obituary noted that [...] "class rather than performance guaranteed his place." [...] He made his first-class debut against Sussex, scoring a duck in his first innings and 24 runs in the second. He passed fifty on just one occasion that season, scoring 319 runs at an average of 16.78, and bowled 69 balls without taking a wicket. Nevertheless, he played in the University Match, scoring just 19 and 36.|$|E
500|$|Contemporaries of Edwards {{have been}} unstinting in their praise of his abilities. Bobby Charlton {{described}} him as [...] "the only player {{that made me feel}} inferior" [...] and said his death was [...] "the biggest single tragedy ever to happen to Manchester United and English football". Terry Venables claimed that, had he lived, it would have been Edwards, not Bobby Moore, who lifted the World Cup trophy as England captain in 1966. Tommy Docherty stated that [...] "there {{is no doubt in my}} mind that Duncan would have become the greatest player ever. Not just in British football, with United and England, but the best in the world. George Best was something special, as was Pelé and Maradona, but in my mind Duncan was much better in terms of <b>all-round</b> <b>ability</b> and skill." [...] In recognition of his talents Edwards was made an inaugural inductee to the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002. [...] His memorabilia was exhibited at Dudley Museum prior to its closure, and was subsequently sold to Manchester United with a selection to be loaned back for display at the Dudley Archives.|$|E
500|$|On the {{recommendation}} of Peter Taylor, who was by now assistant manager of Watford, Hessenthaler was signed by the Hertfordshire club for a transfer fee of £65,000 {{at the beginning of}} the 1991–92 season. He opted to make the move even though becoming a full-time professional player would mean taking a drop in earnings compared to what he was making combining semi-professional football with building work. His professional debut was against Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park on 17 September 1991, and, despite having made a move of four divisions up the English football league system, he immediately established himself as a regular at Vicarage Road, making 35 Football League appearances in his first season. In five seasons with the Hornets, he made 217 appearances in total, scoring 14 goals, and also served as the team's captain. Watford fans voted Hessenthaler as runner-up for the club's Player of the Season award in four consecutive seasons between 1992 and 1995, and fondly remember him for his workrate and <b>all-round</b> <b>ability.</b> He was one of the club veterans selected to represent Watford in the 2006 London Masters football event, where he was named [...] "Player of the Tournament".|$|E
50|$|In {{his second}} season (1995-96), he once again led the All-Star fan balloting, this time edging Michael Jordan (Jordan's first All-Star game after {{returning}} since retiring in 1993). During the 1995-96 season, Hill showcased his <b>all-round</b> <b>abilities</b> by leading the NBA in triple-doubles (10). He also {{won a gold medal}} at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta {{as a member of the}} U.S. men's basketball team, where he had the team's fifth highest scoring average (9.7) and led the team in steals (18). In 1996-97 season, Hill averaged 21.4 points, 9.0 rebounds, 7.3 assists and 1.8 steals per game. He became the first player since Larry Bird in 1989-90 to average 20 points, 9 rebounds and 7 assists in a season, an accomplishment that had not been duplicated until Russell Westbrook averaged a triple-double in the 2016-17 NBA season. Once again, Hill led the league in triple-doubles, where his 13 triple-doubles represented 35 percent of the league's triple-double total that season. He was the league's Player of the Month for January and was also awarded NBA's IBM Award, given to the player with the biggest statistical contributions to his team. He finished third in MVP voting, behind Karl Malone and Michael Jordan.|$|R

In 1954 she was awarded the Emmy Destinn and Karel Burian prize at the singing {{competition}} of the International Prague Spring Festival at which she performed arias including [...] "Depuis le jour" [...] from Charpentier’s Louise. Her secure technique enabled her to interpret both light coloratura roles as well as dramatic parts. Her vast repertory included more than 80 roles such as Abigaile in Nabucco, both Agathe and Ännchen in Der Freischütz, Cio-Cio-San in Madama Butterfly, Donna Anna in Don Giovanni, Elisabetta in Don Carlos, Elsa in Lohengrin, Fiordiligi in Così fan tutte, Gilda in Rigoletto, Konstanze in Die Entführung aus dem Serail, Lady Macbeth in Macbeth, Leonora in Il trovatore, Lisa in The Queen of Spades, Lyudmila in Ruslan and Lyudmila, Marguerite in Faust, Micaëla in Carmen, both Mimì and Musetta in La bohème, Pamina in The Magic Flute, Santuzza in Cavalleria rusticana, Sieglinde in Die Walküre, Tatyana in Eugene Onegin, Violetta in La traviata, and the title roles in Louise, Tosca, and Turandot. But above all, she excelled in portraying roles from Czech operas by Smetana, Dvořák and Janáček including the title roles of Libuše, Rusalka and Jenůfa, Mařenka in Prodaná nevěsta (The Bartered Bride) and Emilia Marty in Věc Makropulos (Makropulos Case).|$|R

He took only one wicket, dismissing Bobby Peel caught and bowled for 1. Batting at number eleven in the first innings he made 1not out and in the second, 5runs batting at number ten. Despite this lack of success, he retained his spot in the team for the Second Test at The Oval where he failed to take a wicket. He was selected for the Third Test at Old Trafford but continuous rain saw the match abandoned without a ball being bowled. Trumble played 28first-class matches during the tour, scoring 288runs {{at an average of}} 8.47 and took 52wickets at an average of 21.75.

2500|$|Later in 1996, Cork had a less {{successful}} period in Test cricket, taking 10 wickets during India's three match Test tour {{at an average}} of 36.90. [...] Later followed a quiet Test series against Pakistan, in which he had 12 wickets at a little over 36 a piece. [...] His form with the bat was little better in either series, with his <b>all-round</b> <b>ability</b> seemingly having deserted him. [...] Despite this, he was made a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1996. [...] Prior to the tour of New Zealand, Cork suffered personal issues off the pitch with the breakdown of his marriage to his first wife Jane. [...] His personal issues impacted his performances on the field, this was illustrated by his bowling performances. [...] At the end of the Test series he had taken just 7 wickets {{at an average of}} 42.85. [...] His batting did fare better, scoring 59 in the first Test and he led England to a series winning victory in the 3rd Test, putting on 76 runs with John Crawley to remind people of the batting side of his game. [...] He fared even worse in the ODI series though, taking just a single wicket throughout at the cost of 145 runs. [...] He would not play another ODI until 2001. [...] Cork described how he was not in the right frame of mind to play international cricket at the time and how his performances were affected by this, further commenting he had no idea when running in to bowl what delivery he would send down to the batsman. [...] There was, however, a feeling in some quarters that Cork was [...] "more style than substance", and during the tour he was the target of a comment from Geoffrey Boycott who alleged that Cork was a [...] "show pony" [...] with [...] "an attitude problem". [...] Cork was prevented from answering Boycott back when injury prevented him from playing during most of the 1997 English season.|$|E

2500|$|This match {{will always}} be remembered as [...] "Taylor's match". When the team for the Test was announced, the Australian {{selectors}} had included the name of Peter Taylor from NSW. Thinking that a mistake in names had been made, the Australian media besieged {{the home of the}} talented young NSW opener Mark Taylor, thinking that he had been selected to play his first Test. Although history shows that Mark Taylor had a substantial Test career later on, the selectors had made no mistake in the name. NSW off-spinner Peter Taylor had impressed some selectors (especially Greg Chappell) with his <b>all-round</b> <b>abilities</b> during the previous season's Sheffield Shield final. He was noted as an off-spinner who really spun the ball and a number of the wickets he took during the test match were attributed to his 'loop' (the deceptive flight of a heavily spun cricket ball) and bounce from his unusual but high bowling action. Considering Peter Taylor's limited first-class experience, the selection was risky. Given the state of Australian cricket at this point, {{and the fact that the}} Ashes had already been lost, such a selection could be considered desperate. The selection was so shocking that the media quickly dubbed him [...] "Peter Who?", and he became something of a celebrity leading up to the match. Spectators voiced their opinion too on the first day of the match. [...] "Aussie Selectors couldn't pick Bill Lawry's Nose" [...] declared one banner. No doubt these same spectators would have been cheering 5 days later as this unlikely player received the man of the match award.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study has been to find out whether people, mainly teachers, are {{prescriptive}} or descriptive in their attitude towards language, and whether grammar books, dictionaries and textbooks used in schools are in accordance with these attitudes. In order to study this problem a comparison has been made between the results of a linguistic study and the results of a questionnaire distributed to native and non- native speakers. The linguistic study has been based on information taken from grammars and textbooks commonly used in the Swedish compulsory school and at universities. The result shows that people in general are both prescriptive and descriptive in their attitudes towards language. However, a slight majority decided in favor of a descriptive attitude. In the text- and grammar books intended for pupils in the compulsory school system, a very limited number of language varieties are presented.
