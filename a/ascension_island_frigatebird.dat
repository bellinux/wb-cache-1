5|$|The Fregatidae are {{a sister}} group to Suloidea which {{consists}} of cormorants, darters, gannets, and boobies. Three of the five extant species of frigatebirds are widespread, (the magnificent, great and lesser frigatebirds) while two are endangered (the Christmas <b>Island</b> and <b>Ascension</b> <b>Island</b> <b>frigatebirds)</b> and restrict their breeding habitat to one small island each. The oldest fossils date to the early Eocene, around 50 million years ago. Classified in the genus Limnofregata, the three species had shorter, less-hooked bills and longer legs, and lived in a freshwater environment.|$|R

5|$|Two of {{the five}} species are {{considered}} at risk. In 2003, {{a survey of the}} four colonies of the critically endangered Christmas <b>Island</b> <b>frigatebirds</b> counted 1200 breeding pairs. As frigatebirds normally breed every other year, the total adult population was estimated to lie between 1800 and 3600 pairs. Larger numbers formerly bred on the island, but the clearance of breeding habitat during World War II and dust pollution from phosphate mining have contributed to the decrease. The population of the vulnerable Ascension frigatebird has been estimated at around 12,500 individuals. The birds formerly bred on <b>Ascension</b> <b>Island</b> itself, but the colonies were exterminated by feral cats introduced in 1815. The birds continued to breed on a rocky outcrop just off the shore of the island. A program conducted between 2002 and 2004 eradicated the feral cats and a few birds have returned to nest on the island.|$|R

40|$|Green turtles (Chelonia mydas) swim from {{foraging}} grounds {{along the}} Brazilian coast to <b>Ascension</b> <b>Island</b> to nest, over 2200 km distant {{in the middle}} of the equatorial Atlantic. To test the hypothesis that turtles use wind-borne cues to locate <b>Ascension</b> <b>Island</b> we found turtles that had just completed nesting and then moved three individuals 50 km northwest (downwind) of the island and three individuals 50 km southeast (upwind). Their subsequent movements were tracked by satellite. Turtles released downwind returned to <b>Ascension</b> <b>Island</b> within 1, 2 and 4 days, respectively. By contrast, those released upwind had far more difficulty in relocating <b>Ascension</b> <b>Island,</b> two eventually returning after 10 and 27 days and the third heading back to Brazil after failing to find its way back to the island. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that wind-borne cues are used by turtles to locate <b>Ascension</b> <b>Island...</b>|$|R
