This is the first report on {{fracture of}} the VerSys fully bead-coated femoral stem, which is designed for diaphyseal fixation and <b>for</b> <b>application</b> in <b>revision</b> surgery or when a proximal fixation is not feasible. Between 2000 and 2008, we implanted 41 VerSys fully coated stems in 40 patients. We present four cases of femoral stem fractures at 23, 31, 40, and 86 months after surgery. The common risk factors for these four patients were inadequate support for the implant in the proximal femur due to nonunion in this area, a stem diameter ≤ 12  mm, and a relatively young age...|$|R
