5|$|William Watson, a {{scientist}} {{specializing in the}} study of electricity, theorized that perhaps electricity was attracted to conductors that were pointed. Watson received in 1746 from Dr. John Mitchell a lengthy Franklin letter on theories about thunderstorms and pointed conductors as related to electricity. He read part of the letter to fellow members of the Royal Society of London on November 9, 1749. A week later he finished the reading. On December 4 Watson received another similar Franklin letter dated April 29, 1749, from Collinson <b>and</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> to the Society on December 21, 1749. Over the next two years Collinson had transmitted to the Society more of Franklin's letters he had received describing electrical experiments done by Franklin and his team of experimenters. Many talked about the tendency of an electrical discharge to be attracted to a pointed conductor that was grounded - the basics to his lightning rod invention to protect wooden buildings such as houses and churches.|$|E

500|$|... "Gone for Goode" [...] {{marks the}} first {{performance}} of Richard Belzer as Detective John Munch, a character the actor has played in more than 300 television episodes {{in a number of}} shows, including Homicide and [...] Levinson said Belzer was a [...] "lousy actor" [...] during his first audition with the [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] script. Levinson asked Belzer to take some time to reread and practice the material, then come back <b>and</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> again. During his second reading, Levinson said Belzer was [...] "still terrible", but that the actor eventually found confidence in his performance. [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] included guest appearances by actors who later become much more widely known. Steve Harris, who later achieved fame playing Eugene Young on the ABC legal drama The Practice, played an uncooperative suspect who repeatedly lies to Munch during questioning. Alexander Chaplin, who later played speechwriter James Hobert on the ABC sitcom Spin City, portrayed the alleged murderer Johnny in [...] "Gone for Goode". The comedic confession scenes involving Jim Grollman as accused murderer Jerry Jempson were almost entirely improvised.|$|E

500|$|Achebe's {{criticism}} {{has become a}} mainstream perspective on Conrad's work. The essay {{was included in the}} 1988 Norton critical edition of Conrad's novel. Editor Robert Kimbrough called it one of [...] "the three most important events in Heart of Darkness criticism since the second edition of his book..." [...] Critic Nicolas Tredell divides Conrad criticism [...] "into two epochal phases: before and after Achebe." [...] Asked frequently about his essay, Achebe once explained that he never meant for the work to be abandoned: [...] "It's not in my nature to talk about banning books. I am saying, read it– with the kind of understanding and with the knowledge I talk about. <b>And</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> beside African works." [...] Interviewed on National Public Radio with Robert Siegel, in October 2009, Achebe remains consistent, although tempering this criticism in a discussion entitled [...] "'Heart of Darkness' is inappropriate": [...] "Conrad was a seductive writer. He could pull his reader into the fray. And {{if it were not for}} what he said about me and my people, I would probably be thinking only of that seduction." ...|$|E
500|$|Negron first {{appears in}} the film's frame story as a bitter, 70-year-old World War II veteran living in Harlem, New York who {{reflects}} on his experiences during World War II. Negron, a black Puerto Rican, is fluent in English, Spanish and Italian, which enables him {{to serve as a}} translator for the Americans and Italians. [...] Alonso first learned of the novel from his agent <b>and</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> prior to auditioning for the role. [...] He had to convince Lee that he was fluent in Spanish, and created an audition tape of himself speaking the language, which won him the role. Alonso found difficulty in portraying Negron as an elderly World War II veteran: “This role was very emotionally draining. Ninety percent of the time, the elderly have outlived most of the people they have loved. When I played Negrón as an old man, I had to focus on everything I’ve lost in my life: my dad, friends and love lost, and that was a really depressing thing to do.” ...|$|E
500|$|After {{assuming}} power, Khrushchev {{allowed a}} modest amount {{of freedom in}} the arts. Vladimir Dudintsev's Not by Bread Alone, about an idealistic engineer opposed by rigid bureaucrats, was allowed {{to be published in}} 1956, though Khrushchev called the novel [...] "false at its base". In 1958, however, Khrushchev ordered a fierce attack on Boris Pasternak after his novel Doctor Zhivago was published abroad (he was denied permission to publish it in the Soviet Union). Pravda described the novel as [...] "low-grade reactionary hackwork", and the author was expelled from the Writer's Union. To make things worse (from Khrushchev's perspective), Pasternak was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, which, under heavy pressure, he declined. Once he did so, Khrushchev ordered a halt to the attacks on Pasternak. In his memoirs, Khrushchev stated that he agonized over the novel, very nearly allowed it to be published, and later regretted not doing so. After his fall from power, Khrushchev obtained a copy of the novel <b>and</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> (he had earlier read only excerpts) and stated, [...] "We shouldn't have banned it. I should have read it myself. There's nothing anti-Soviet in it." ...|$|E

500|$|The delegates {{assembled}} the next day, June 24, {{to resume the}} balloting. Before that could begin, Rufus Wheeler Peckham of the New York delegation produced Tilden's letter <b>and</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> to the crowd. [...] The first mention of Tilden's name provoked excitement, but {{the meaning of the}} message soon quieted the crowd. Peckham announced that, with Tilden's withdrawal, New York, now supported Samuel J. Randall. [...] Moving then to the second ballot, more than one hundred delegates followed Peckham's lead in voting for Randall, boosting his total to 128½, just above Bayard's 112. But the shift to Hancock had been greater. Before the totals were announced to the crowd, Hancock had gathered 320 delegates to him; as soon as the voting stopped, however, Wisconsin, and New Jersey changed all of their votes to Hancock. Pennsylvania added those of their votes that were not already for Hancock. [...] Then Smith M. Weed of New York, a Tilden confidante, announced that his state, too, would shift all of its 70 votes to Hancock. After that, according to the party records, [...] "every delegate was on his feet and the roar of ten thousand voices completely drowned the full military band in the gallery." ...|$|E
500|$|The first Homicide season {{featured}} the first performances of Richard Belzer as Detective John Munch, a character the actor has been credited for in 459 television episodes (...) in nine different television series, including Homicide and [...] Levinson asked Belzer {{to audition for}} the part after hearing the comedian ranting on The Howard Stern Show, where Belzer was a frequent guest. Levinson said Belzer was a [...] "lousy actor" [...] during his first audition with the [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] script. Levinson asked Belzer {{to take some time}} to reread and practice the material, then come back <b>and</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> again. During his second reading, Levinson said Belzer was [...] "still terrible", but that the actor eventually found confidence in his performance. Daniel Baldwin was cast as Beau Felton, and dyed his naturally blond hair black for the role. Baldwin {{became one of the most}} vocal supporters of the show, giving many press interviews about it and defending it amid declining ratings. Baldwin declared, [...] "Homicide is the best material I've had the chance to do." [...] Melissa Leo was cast as Kay Howard, which was considered a particularly strong part compared to other female characters in police dramas at the time, which were usually limited to love interests or minor parts. While most cast members shadowed real-life Baltimore detectives to prepare for the roles, Leo did not because, she said, [...] "I don't like to look at the horror that's in the world." [...] Wendy Hughes was cast as medical examiner Carol Blythe.|$|E
500|$|The {{students}} at South Park Elementary {{are assigned to}} read The Catcher in the Rye, and (especially the four main boys) grow excited when Mr. Garrison tells them that the book has caused so much controversy, it has been banned from {{public schools in the}} past. However, after reading the book, Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny are disappointed to find the content completely inoffensive, and feel the school has [...] "tricked" [...] them into reading. They decide to write their own offensive novel, The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs (which they originally called The Tale of Scrotie McDickinass), with the intention of disgusting as many people as possible. Later, Stan's parents find the first draft <b>and</b> <b>read</b> <b>it.</b> They find it so disgusting that they repeatedly vomit while reading. However, they both absolutely loved the book. In fear that they will get into trouble for the book's content, Stan and the boys trick Butters into thinking that he actually wrote the book. Butters believes them because ever since reading The Catcher in the Rye, he feels as though he has been entering into [...] "altered states of consciousness" [...] that make him want to kill John Lennon, before he finds out (from his father) that Lennon is already dead ("Dangit!"). Later on, after learning that The Catcher in the Rye also inspired someone to shoot Ronald Reagan, Butters at first goes out to kill him too but is told that he is dead as well, much to his dismay.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{generally}} have found less to favor in Smith's second book, Court Duel, though reviews have still been mainly positive. It was noted by Carolyn Phelan of Booklist to be [...] "different in setting, structure, and tone" [...] from its predecessor, {{who added that}} [...] "readers who loved Crown Duel for its strongly realized fantasy world, adventurous characters, and scenes of action may find the sequel disappointing," [...] though she found Meliara to be [...] "as compelling as ever." [...] Ruth Cox of Emergency Librarian observed [...] "a flicker of the love/hate relationship often found in adult romance novels between Meliara and Shevraeth." [...] Contributing to Brigham Young's Children's Book and Play Review, Leah Hanson called the second part [...] "fast paced and intriguing," [...] and said it could [...] "stand on its own as an enthralling story." [...] Jo Walton believed that the second story's changing fashions and fan customs were [...] "done very well," [...] and added that the court's culture of terror felt real. She opined that [...] "Mel's eruption into their midst has in it something of the stranger coming to Versailles, and it's fascinating," [...] but called [...] "Mel's continued obliviousness to the identity of her mysterious Unknown correspondent" [...] "slightly implausible." [...] Walton concluded that the combined volume Crown Duel is [...] "a charming book with a solid background and a great first person voice. Give it to your twelve year old friends, <b>and</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> with your inner twelve-year-old eyes." [...] The publication Voice of Youth Advocates included Crown Duel in its list of [...] "fantasy for people who don't like fantasy," [...] and wrote that the novel [...] "ha few fantastical creatures, and readers will relate easily to the main characters." ...|$|E
