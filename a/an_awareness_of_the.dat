5|$|In recent times, {{the focus}} has been on {{creating}} <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> threat to the Earth's ecosystems from human overpopulation and its consequent need for biological and physical resources. Botanical gardens provide an excellent medium for communication between the world of botanical science and the general public. Education programs can help the public develop greater environmental awareness by understanding the meaning and importance of ideas like conservation and sustainability.|$|E
5|$|Many critics {{repeatedly}} {{asserted that}} she was calling {{for the elimination of}} all pesticides. Yet Carson had made it clear she was not advocating the banning or complete withdrawal of helpful pesticides, but was instead encouraging responsible and carefully managed use with <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chemicals' impact on the entire ecosystem. In fact, she concludes her section on DDT in Silent Spring not by urging a total ban, but with advice for spraying as little as possible to limit the development of resistance.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Spirit Fruit Society lived {{according}} to the following basic principles: seek happiness through selflessness; follow one's conscience; take responsibility for one's actions—and develop <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> consequences of one's actions on others; and accept whatever happens. Beilhart believed very strongly in the individual's right to guide his own actions, and not be dictated to by others. While {{there was no mention}} of any kind of organization or hierarchy in any documents, as the leader, Beilhart likely made important decisions concerning the group. There is no record of any kind of internal conflict between members.|$|E

Procurement of local raw materials would have been a simple task to accomplish, yet MSA sites regularly contain raw materials that were obtained from sources over 100 km away, and sometimes farther than 300 km. Obtaining raw materials from this distance would require <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resources, a perceived value in the resources, whether it be functional or symbolic, and, possibly, the ability to organize an exchange network in order to obtain the materials.|$|E

25|$|The {{modern era}} saw the {{development}} of undergraduate and post-graduate nursing degrees. Advancement of nursing research and a desire for association and organization {{led to the formation}} of a wide variety of professional organizations and academic journals.

25|$|Step 1: Journey to Delphi— Supplicants were {{motivated}} by some need to undertake the long and sometimes arduous journey to come to Delphi in order to consult the oracle.

25|$|Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress is {{an allegory}} of {{personal}} salvation and {{a guide to}} the Christian life. Instead of any focus on eschatology or divine retribution, Bunyan instead writes about how the individual saint can prevail against the temptations of mind and body that threaten damnation. The book is written in a straightforward narrative and shows influence from both drama and biography, and yet it also shows <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> allegorical tradition found in Edmund Spenser.|$|E

25|$|At the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies in Mississippi, it {{has also}} been {{observed}} that the resident dolphins seem to show <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> future. The dolphins are trained to keep their own tank clean by retrieving rubbish and bringing it to a keeper, to be rewarded with a fish. However, one dolphin, named Kelly, has apparently learned a way to get more fish, by hoarding the rubbish under a rock {{at the bottom of the}} pool and bringing it up one small piece at a time.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} the late nineteenth century, with the {{approach}} of the Centenary of the Colony, that <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> value of public archives as fundamental sources for Australian history was recorded. This interest led to the appointment of an Archivist of New South Wales, and the publication of Historical Records of New South Wales. At the time the term 'archives' was used broadly to include manuscripts, pictorial material and maps {{from a wide range of}} private sources as well as to denote non-current official records.|$|E
25|$|For {{the republican}} and monarchical civic states of the 19th century, {{collections}} {{in the form of}} public museums became emblems of self-determination. The carting off of large numbers of artworks to Paris during the Napoleonic Wars had created <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> identity-shaping power of art. Institutional role models were the “Musée français” in the Louvre and the “Musée des monuments français” in a former Augustinian convent, which closed in 1816. The maintenance of programmatic museum collections and the construction of museum buildings {{became one of the most}} prominent and defining national functions.|$|E

25|$|The {{important}} {{legacy of}} this period included substantial advances in factual knowledge, especially in anatomy, zoology, botany, mineralogy, geography, mathematics and astronomy; <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> importance of certain scientific problems, especially those related {{to the problem of}} change and its causes; and a recognition of the methodological importance of applying mathematics to natural phenomena and of undertaking empirical research. In the Hellenistic age scholars frequently employed the principles developed in earlier Greek thought: the application of mathematics and deliberate empirical research, in their scientific investigations. Thus, clear unbroken lines of influence lead from ancient Greek and Hellenistic philosophers, to medieval Muslim philosophers and scientists, to the European Renaissance and Enlightenment, to the secular sciences of the modern day.|$|E
25|$|When the Board of Control {{published}} {{their second}} survey in 1961 {{the use of}} psychosurgery had declined by more than half; the decline being attributed to <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> risks of irreversible effects and the introduction in 1955 of neuroleptic drugs. By 1961 nearly half of mental hospitals in the United Kingdom were no longer carrying out leucotomies. Approximately 500 operations were performed a year, and were unevenly distributed over the country. Someone hospitalised in the North East Metropolitan region was more than 15 {{times more likely to}} undergo psychosurgery than someone hospitalised in the neighbouring East Anglian region. There were also random differences in the type of operation used and the type of illness treated. Twenty per cent of operations were still standard pre-frontal leucotomies; the rest were new operations, and a few centres used stereotactic techniques. Some hospitals still used psychosurgery to treat chronic schizophrenia, in others the only indications were depression or obsessive illness.|$|E
25|$|The Stainforth Trophy was {{designed}} by Robin Beresford. The trophy depicts in silver three supersonic aircraft and spiralling vapour trails soaring into the stratosphere. The artist also tried to display <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> achievements of the Schneider Trophy Team in the design, being aware that these achievements resulted in the improved design and development, by R. J. Mitchell, of the Spitfire, which played such {{a major role in}} Britain's victory in World War II. In the design of the trophy, the artist has tried to show the Earth as seen by the astronauts, vapour trails ending in arrows to depict high speed altitude flight, and with an outward sweep to infinity, which suggests that the sky is literally the limit of man's achievement in the air. Into his design, he has incorporated a star and its orbit to evoke the achievements of science and the Royal Air Force motto Per ardua ad astra.|$|E
