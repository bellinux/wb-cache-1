5|$|Bupropion is {{also known}} {{to act as a}} non-competitive {{antagonist}} of the α3β2, α3β4, α4β2, and, very weakly, α7 nACh receptors, and these actions appear to be importantly involved in its beneficial properties not only in smoking cessation, but in depression as well. The metabolites of bupropion also act as non-competitive antagonists of these nACh receptors, and hydroxybupropion is even more potent in comparison. At therapeutically-relevant concentrations bupropion and hydroxybupropion act as negative allosteric modulators of the serotonin 5-HT3A receptor. Pharmacological data on bupropion and its metabolites are shown in the table. Bupropion is known to weakly inhibit the α1 <b>adrenergic</b> <b>receptor,</b> with a 14% potency of its dopamine uptake inhibition, and the H1 receptor, with a 9% potency.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include shakiness, headache, fast heart rate, dizziness, and feeling anxious. Serious side effects may include {{worsening}} bronchospasm, irregular heartbeat, and low blood potassium levels. It {{can be used}} during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but safety is not entirely clear. It is a short-acting β2 <b>adrenergic</b> <b>receptor</b> agonist which works by causing airway smooth muscles to relax.|$|E
25|$|An α2A <b>adrenergic</b> <b>receptor</b> agonist {{has also}} been {{approved}} in the US. Clonidine was initially developed {{as a treatment for}} high blood pressure. Low doses in evenings and/or afternoons are sometimes used in conjunction with stimulants to help with sleep and because clonidine sometimes helps moderate impulsive and oppositional behavior and may reduce tics. It may be more useful for comorbid Tourette syndrome.|$|E

40|$|Although {{peptic ulcer}} disease {{has long been}} recognized, the pro-posed {{mechanisms}} of its etiopathogenesis change every year. This review shows that gastric ulcers have a significant relationship with alpha- 2 <b>adrenergic</b> <b>receptors.</b> The aggravating factors of gastric ulcer formation {{have been reported to}} act by blocking alpha- 2 <b>adrenergic</b> <b>receptors,</b> whereas drugs possessing anti-ulcer activity have been shown to ensure gastric protection by stimulating the alpha- 2 adren-ergic receptors. The data derived from the literature indicate the like-lihood that any drug or substance selectively stimulating the alpha- 2 <b>adrenergic</b> <b>receptors</b> may possess anti-ulcer activity...|$|R
25|$|Epinephrine acts by binding to {{a variety}} of {{adrenergic}} receptors. Epinephrine is a nonselective agonist of all adrenergic receptors, including the major subtypes α1, α2, β1, β2, and β3. Epinephrine's binding to these receptors triggers a number of metabolic changes. Binding to α-adrenergic receptors inhibits insulin secretion by the pancreas, stimulates glycogenolysis in the liver and muscle, and stimulates glycolysis and inhibits insulin-mediated glycogenesis in muscle. β <b>adrenergic</b> <b>receptor</b> binding triggers glucagon secretion in the pancreas, increased adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion by the pituitary gland, and increased lipolysis by adipose tissue. Together, these effects lead to increased blood glucose and fatty acids, providing substrates for energy production within cells throughout the body.|$|E
25|$|Regulation of {{receptor}} proteins {{occurs when}} the PDZ domain on the EBP50 protein binds to the C-terminus of the beta-2 <b>adrenergic</b> <b>receptor</b> (ß2-AR). EBP50 also associates with a complex that connects to actin, thus serving as {{a link between the}} cytoskeleton and ß2-AR. The ß2-AR receptor is eventually endocytosed, where it will either be consigned to a lysosome for degradation or recycled back to the cell membrane. Scientists have demonstrated that when the Ser-411 residue of the ß2-AR PDZ binding domain, which interacts directly with EBP50, is phosphorylated, the receptor is degraded. If Ser-411 is left unmodified, the receptor is recycled. The role played by PDZ domains and their binding sites indicate a regulative relevance beyond simply receptor protein localization.|$|E
2500|$|Pseudoephedrine is a {{sympathomimetic}} amine. Its principal {{mechanism of}} action relies on its direct action on the <b>adrenergic</b> <b>receptor</b> system. [...] The vasoconstriction that pseudoephedrine produces {{is believed to be}} principally an α-adrenergic receptor response.|$|E

2500|$|... β <b>adrenergic</b> <b>receptor</b> antagonists (also called beta-blockers or β-blockers) were {{initially}} {{developed in the}} 1960s, {{for the treatment of}} angina pectoris but are now also used for [...] hypertension, congestive heart failure and certain arrhythmias. [...] In the 1950s, dichloroisoproterenol (DCI) was discovered to be a β-antagonist that blocked the effects of sympathomimetic amines on bronchodilation, uterine relaxation and heart stimulation. Although DCI had no clinical utility, a change in the compound did provide a clinical candidate, pronethalol, which was introduced in 1962.|$|E
2500|$|The {{structures}} of activated or agonist-bound GPCRs {{have also been}} determined. [...] These structures indicate how ligand binding at the extracellular side of a receptor leads to conformational changes in the cytoplasmic side of the receptor. The biggest change is an outward movement of the cytoplasmic part of the 5th and 6th transmembrane helix (TM5 and TM6). The structure of activated beta-2 <b>adrenergic</b> <b>receptor</b> in complex with Gs confirmed that the Gα binds to a cavity created by this movement.|$|E
2500|$|... β-blockers can be {{selective}} {{for either}} β1, β2 <b>adrenergic</b> <b>receptor,</b> {{or to be}} non-selective. By blocking β1 receptor {{it is possible to}} reduce heart rate, conduction of velocity and contractility. The blocking of β2 receptor promotes vascular smooth muscle contraction, which results in increase of peripheral resistance. Blockade of the β2 receptor effectively reduces the sympathetic activity, which results in reduce of the associated platelet-and coagulation activation. This is why a non-selective β-blocker treatment may result in a lower risk of both arterial and venous embolic events.|$|E

2500|$|In liver cells, {{adrenaline}} binds to the β <b>adrenergic</b> <b>receptor,</b> which changes conformation {{and helps}} Gs, a G protein, exchange GDP to GTP. This trimeric G protein dissociates to Gs alpha and Gs beta/gamma subunits. Gs alpha binds to adenyl cyclase, thus converting ATP into cyclic AMP. Cyclic AMP binds to the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A: Protein kinase A phosphorylates phosphorylase kinase. Meanwhile, Gs beta/gamma binds to the calcium channel and allows calcium ions {{to enter the}} cytoplasm. Calcium ions bind to calmodulin proteins, a protein present in all eukaryotic cells, which then binds to phosphorylase kinase and finishes its activation. Phosphorylase kinase phosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase, which then phosphorylates glycogen and converts it to glucose-6-phosphate.|$|E

50|$|Beta-2 <b>adrenergic</b> <b>receptors</b> {{have also}} been found to couple with Gi, {{possibly}} providing a mechanism by which response to ligand is highly localized within cells. In contrast, Beta-1 <b>adrenergic</b> <b>receptors</b> are coupled only to Gs, and stimulation of these results in a more diffuse cellular response. This appears to be mediated by cAMP induced PKA phosphorylation of the receptor.|$|R

However, the functional role of the α- 1 <b>adrenergic</b> <b>receptors</b> in cerebral blood flow (CBF) regulation is yet to be established. The traditional thinking being that during normotension and normocapnia sympathetic neural activity does not play a significant role in CBF regulation. Reports in the past have stated that catecholamines do not penetrate the blood brain barrier (BBB) and therefore only influence cerebral vessels from outside the BBB and hence, have a limited role in CBF regulation. However, with the advent of dynamic measurement techniques, beat-to-beat CBF assessment can be done during dynamic changes in arterial blood pressure.
