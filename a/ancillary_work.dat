5000|$|The Commission {{eventually}} transferred 13.5 {{million acres}} (55,000 km²) by 1920. Following the Land Conference of December 1902 arranged by George Wyndham (a conservative minister and Chief Secretary for Ireland, but also descended from Lord Edward FitzGerald), the revolutionary Wyndham Land (Purchase) Act 1903 was orchestrated through Parliament by William OBrien, MP, which provided government finance {{to buy out}} freeholds, with the former tenant farmers paying back the capital over 68 years. This was managed by the Land Commission, along with <b>ancillary</b> <b>work</b> such as compiling statistics. Valuations were reckoned on a [...] "years purchase" [...] (Y.P.) basis, the price being a multiple of (perhaps 16 times) the annual rent, instead of the discounted cash flow method used today. The Commission had to supervise the haggling process and find the fairest multiple for every transfer. The loans issued by government were resold in the capital markets as [...] "Land Bonds".|$|E

30|$|We {{previously}} {{observed that}} sodium lactate infusion enhanced fluid balance in pig endotoxic shock [25, 26]. This beneficial effect of sodium lactate {{could not be}} totally explained neither by its hyperosmolar or alkalizing effects [25] nor by its energy load or {{its effect on the}} chloride balance [26]. Finally, two additional mechanisms have been hypothesized: first, lactate infusion is better metabolized in poor hemodynamic conditions than glucose, and second, lactate could decrease proinflammatory response and/or improve endothelial barrier function. Interestingly, {{it is well known that}} proinflammatory response and endothelial dysfunction exacerbate the endotoxin-induced DIC [27, 28]. So, in order to better understand the beneficial effect of sodium lactate on fluid balance, we conducted an <b>ancillary</b> <b>work</b> focused on DIC and renal histology.|$|E

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) markers, coagulation and inflammation parameters were measured over a 5 -h period. Immediately after euthanasia, kidneys were withdrawn for histological study. Statistical analysis was performed with nonparametric tests and the Dunn correction for multiple comparisons. A p <  0.05 was considered significant.|$|E

An assignment of the experimental spectra was carried out based on the calculated INS transition frequencies and intensities (at the DFT level), thereby achieving a good correspondence between the calculated and observed data. Unusually good-quality INS spectra were obtained from about 250 mg, which is the smallest sample of a hydrogenous compound for which a successful INS interpretation has been reported. The knowledge of the local configuration of this kind of complexes is essential for an accurate understanding of their activity, which will pave the way for the rational design of novel third-generation drugs comprising cisplatin- and carboplatin-like moieties...|$|E
40|$|In {{the core}} of this thesis I test and confirm the {{hypothesis}} that separate classes of interneurons respond differentially to sensory stimulation independent of volitional or other top-down control {{on the part of the}} animal. I also test and confirm the hypothesis that, based only on bottom-up sensory stimulation the activity of two major classes of interneurons (adapting Parvalbumin positive and facilitating Somatostatin positive interneurons) predominates during different phases of what corresponds to natural sensing cycles in a behaving rodent. These questions are addressed using an in vivo mouse model with intrinsically fluorescent, but differentiable, interneuron populations combined with 2 -photon imaging, Ca²+-sensitive dyes. Anesthesia and electrical control of facial muscles allowed for naturalistic stimulation without the confounds presented by volitional whisking and unknown top-down or behavioral states.

The report consolidates preliminary operational guidelines, all <b>ancillary</b> <b>work</b> products, and a companion software tool that facilitates their implementation into one reference source document. The report {{is intended for}} interim use and comment and provides the foundation for fostering future reviews of the operational guidelines and their implementation within emergency preparedness and response initiatives {{in the event of}} a radiological dispersal device (RDD) incident. The report principally focuses on the technical derivation and presentation of the operational guidelines. End-user guidance providing more details on how to apply these operational guidelines within planning and response settings is being considered and developed elsewhere. The preliminary operational guidelines are categorized into seven groups on the basis of their intended application within early, intermediate, and long-term recovery phases of emergency response. We anticipate that these operational guidelines will be updated and refined by interested government agencies in response to comments and lessons learned from their review, consideration, and trial application. This review, comment, and trial application process will facilitate the selection of a final set of operational guidelines that may be more or less inclusive of the preliminary operational guidelines presented in this report. These and updated versions of the operational guidelines will be made available through the OGT public Web site ([URL] as they become finalized for public distribution and comment...|$|E

40|$|The Marine Mammal Programme (MMP) conducts {{research}} on pinnipeds and killer whales Orcinus orca at Marion Island, Prince Edward Islands, {{under the auspices}} of the Mammal Research Institute, Department of Zoology and Entomology, University of Pretoria. The history of the MMP, which has benefited from collaboration with leading national and international researchers, is described from its start through to current research. The setting up of long-term studies such as the mark-resighting of southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina commenced in 1983. The elephant seal population declined by 87 % between an initial census in 1951 and 2004. This was followed by a stabilisation period and a current increase. The recovery, and subsequent increase of sympatric populations of Subantarctic fur seals Arctocephalus tropicalis and Antarctic fur seals A. gazella (following cessation of commercial sealing), are documented. Insights into many aspects of elephant seal and fur seal biology, including life history, demography, diet, growth, foraging and ranging behaviour are described. <b>Ancillary</b> <b>work</b> on morphology, genetics, anthropogenic influences and rare events are mentioned, as well as the extent of current research that addresses population dynamics in an ecosystem context. Opportunistic photographic identification of killer whales and recent dedicated observations at Marion Island are used to determine population size, seasonal abundance and sociality of this population, and to further understanding of its potential impact on resident pinniped populations.

Questions usually at the forefront when speaking of design-build. At our department, making is making a really strong comeback. Product, exhibits and even buildings are "going-up" full size. I can hardly remember why we once insisted on only drawing things. Design-build projects are laborious in a way that {{has little to do with}} wielding a hammer or pouring concrete. The studio instructor preparing a design-build syllabus must broker a deal, find an interested community partner [a. k. a. an academically conflict of interest free client], secure a viable site, obtain funding, prepare legal agreements, etc. During the project, the same instructor must act as project manager, contractor, lead designer, safety officer, site supervisor and master craftsman. Beyond the project, he/she must ensure [...] on time/on budget [...] completion, reconcile expenses and handle "after sale calls". The intended paper will be a grand narrative fleshing out three recent and current high-stakes design-build efforts at our school. By constructing a timeline of events, the authors plan to emphasize the magnitude of a project's periphery.

40|$|The {{ascension}} {{and use of}} agile and lightweight {{software development}} methods have challenged extant software design and development paradigms; this is especially notable {{in the case of}} small-team and small-shop software development. In this dissertation, a Reflective-Agile Learning Method and Methodology (RALMM) for small-shop software development, is proposed to enhance communication and learning in the use of agile methods. The purpose of the inquiry in this dissertation pertains to: the nature of the professional practice of small team software development; the implications of the epistemology of Reflective Practice has for the professional practice of small-team software development; and whether the introduction of Reflective Practice to an extant agile methodology improves process, productivity and professional confidence for a small development team. This dissertation uses Dialogical Action Research (Mårtensson and Lee 2004), or Dialogical AR, a qualitative and interpretive research approach, to iteratively develop and refine the Reflective-Agile Learning Model and Method (RALMM). The proposed model and method also considers Hazzan and Tomayko’s (2002, 2004, and 2005) synthesis of Schön’s (1983, 1987) Reflective Practice and Extreme Programming (XP). RALMM is shaped by Argyris and Schön’s theories of practice (1974) and Organizational Learning (1978, 1996) and Schön’s <b>ancillary</b> <b>work</b> on generative metaphor (1979) and frames (Schön et al. 1994). The RALMM artifact was developed in a Dialogical AR Partnership using Lee’s (2007) framework for synthesizing design science and action research. The development and use of RALMM facilitated theorizing on the role of Reflective Practice in the successful use of agile methods. To assist in interpretation and analysis, the data collected during Dialogical AR cycles are analyzed using Strauss and Corbin’s (1998) Grounded Theory as a mode of analysis to guide in the coding and analysis of qualitative evidence from the research. As a result of this research, RALMM improved the practitioners’ processes and productivity. Furthermore, RALMM helped to establish, formalize and reinforce a team learning system for the continued development of the practitioners’ professional repertoire. Additionally, the iterative development of RALMM provides a basis for theorizing on Reflective Practice as an epistemology, paradigm, metaphor and frame of reference for the professional practice of small-shop software development...|$|E
