40|$|Objective: To study whether serum {{parathyroid}} hormone (PTH) <b>and</b> serum <b>calcium</b> {{are associated with}} body mass index (BMI), and their predicting role in obesity. Design: Population based, cross-sectional study. Methods: In 2001 a population-based health survey was held in Tromsø, North Norway. Question-naires on medical history and life-style factors were completed and anthropometric data were col-lected. <b>Calcium</b> <b>and</b> vitamin D intakes and a physical activity score were calculated. Serum <b>calcium</b> <b>and</b> PTH were measured in a subset of 3447 men and 4507 women. Pearson correlation and linear regression were used to evaluate associations between BMI, PTH <b>and</b> serum <b>calcium,</b> <b>and</b> logistic regression {{was used to test}} PTH <b>and</b> serum <b>calcium</b> as predictors of obesity and to calcu-late odds ratio.

Results: For serum <b>calcium</b> <b>and</b> PTH there was a significant positive relation to BMI in both genders (P, 0. 001), which to our knowledge has not previously been reported {{on the basis of a}} large epide-miological study. Age, low <b>calcium</b> <b>and</b> vitamin D intakes were explanatory variables for serum PTH. The highest quartile of serum PTH (. 4. 20 pmol/l) was a significant predictor for obesity (P, 0. 001) in both genders, adjusted for age, physical activity <b>and</b> serum <b>calcium.</b> Obesity rates were higher in those with PTH levels in the highest quartile compared with those in the lower quartiles, which resulted in a relative risk of 1. 40 (95 % confidence interval (C.

5|$|When the sinoatrial {{cells are}} resting, {{they have a}} {{negative}} charge on their membranes. However a rapid influx of sodium ions causes the membrane's charge to become positive.
