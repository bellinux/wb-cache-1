2500|$|In 1842 the Rev John Stevens Henslow, a {{professor}} of Botany at St John's College, Cambridge, discovered coprolites just outside Felixstowe in Suffolk in the villages of Trimley St Martin, Falkenham and Kirton and investigated their composition. Realising their potential {{as a source of}} available phosphate once they had been treated with sulphuric acid, he patented an extraction process and set about finding new sources. [...] Very soon, coprolites were being mined on an industrial scale for use as fertiliser due to their high phosphate content. The major <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>extraction</b> occurred over the east of England, centred on Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely with its refining being carried out in Ipswich by the Fison Company. There is a Coprolite Street near Ipswich docks where the Fisons works once stood. The industry declined in the 1880s but was revived briefly during the First World War to provide phosphates for munitions. A renewed interest in coprolite mining in the First World War extended the area of interest into parts of Buckinghamshire as far west as Woburn Sands.|$|E
40|$|Recent (2007) {{developments}} in automated integration of vector geospatial data with image data combine techniques for extracting point features from image data with algorithms that match point features between data layers. The {{precision and accuracy}} of an image-extracted point feature depend on various factors related to the feature extraction technique and {{to the quality of}} the image in the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>extraction.</b> Furthermore, the precision and accuracy of image-extracted points affect the reliability of the subsequent process for matching points between layers, and consequently, the overall adequacy of the data integration approach. Several approaches for detecting and removing improperly matched points are available. The USGS is investigating the use of a weighted affine transformation to filter point matches during automated integration of vector roads with images. The transformation is applied to a local area of match points to detect probable blunders and remove them from the rubber-sheeting algorithm. Aside from blunder detection capabilities, advantages of this approach include the ability to weight control coordinates relative to estimated precisions of extracted point features, and the ability to estimate the precision of the integrated vector layer through error propagation...|$|E
40|$|From {{the time}} we wake up - to {{the time we}} set the alarm clock for the next morning – we consume energy. Energy is {{produced}} from coal, oil, natural gas, uranium and renewable resources. It is transported by oil tanker, railcar, pipeline, and overhead power. Impacts on environmental systems from energy development, production, and transportation are additive (i. e. the impact from an <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>extraction</b> {{is added to the}} impact of transportation which is added from one area to the next). The only way to deduct impacts is through effective reclamation and eventual ecosystem restoration. Twelve thousand new oil and gas wells have been permitted on federally managed minerals in Wyoming’ Powder River Basin, since the last environmental impact statement in 2003. These 1, 700 oil and gas wells per year plus associated pipelines, power lines and roads have been added to existing disturbance of oil well pads, coal and uranium mines. This is added to residential, recreational and industrial activities in the Powder River Basin. Energy projects proceed through four common phases of development: planning, construction, monitoring, and adaptive management. These four phases are analyzed to identify which phase is most important to reclamation success; how actions in phases might be improved; and how improvements in phases could be coordinated so that overall reclamation success may be enhanced. Results reveal - the most critical phases of energy development are planning and construction. To improve coordination between phases - monitoring and adaptive management must be improved. In order to improve each phase of development - areas of uncertainty need clarification. Four main areas of uncertainty were identified during the study; they lead to four recommendations of action. 1) Define to what stage an ecosystem will be reclaimed or restored. 2) Define suitable soil for reclamation, its depth and methods used to ensure it is salvaged for reclamation. 3) Establish timing and methods of measurement for monitoring. 4) Develop adaptive management strategies to incorporate results of monitoring. By incorporating these four actions and implementing clearly defined reclamation goals, objectives, and standards functioning ecosystems can be maintained during the life of energy development...|$|E

40|$|Possible {{connections}} {{have been}} shown between exposure to cooking fumes and adverse health effects, such as lung cancer, rhinitis and reduced lung function. The {{aim of this study}} was to monitor the personal exposure to some of the harmful components of cooking fumes during the frying of beefsteak under experimental conditions resembling both domestic and occupational cooking situations, and during real-life occupational cooking. In addition, the aim was to investigate the occurrence of the same components during a variety of frying procedures, i. e. with different frying fats, cooking appliances and kitchen exhaust hoods. The spreading of cooking fumes in the kitchen and neighbouring rooms in private homes was also explored. In a custom-built laboratory kitchen, standardized experiments were performed under conditions similar to the frying of beefsteak in real-life domestic and occupational conditions. Personal sampling was conducted of total particles, high molecular weight aldehydes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and ultrafine particles. In addition, stationary measurements of ultrafine and submicrometer particles were performed in the kitchen and in the neighbouring room. Tests were conducted under the use of different frying fats (margarine, soya bean oil, rapeseed oil, olive oil), different types (4 types) and settings (2 levels) of kitchen exhaust hoods and different cooking appliances (gas, electric). In addition, personal sampling of total particles, high molecular weight aldehydes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was conducted in three restaurant kitchens. The studies confirmed the presence of carcinogenic components (higher aldehydes and PAHs) in fumes from Norwegian cooking styles which were collected in the breathing zone of the cook. It was also shown that the fumes spread to neighbouring rooms, and that leaving the kitchen extraction hood on for 30 minutes after the end of frying reduced the spreading significantly. The use of different types and settings of kitchen extraction hoods resulted in different exposure conditions. The choice of frying fat also seemed to affect the concentrations of particulate matter and chemical components produced during the frying of beefsteak, but the studies were not comprehensive enough to recommend preferable fats. In addition, the results indicated that frying on a gas stove caused a higher exposure to some of the hazardous components in cooking fumes than frying on an electric stove. Furthermore, the results suggested that cooking under experimental conditions may give a correct reflection of occupational exposure conditions if numerous repetitions of a very specific and standardized cooking method are performed. The level of total particles and the level of PAHs and higher aldehydes did not covariate, suggesting that the measured levels of particulate matter alone are unsuitable as indicators of the actual health risk inflicted upon persons exposed to cooking fumes. It seems vital to reduce the exposure to cooking fumes as far as possible. In the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>extraction</b> hoods, more research is needed in order to develop optimal systems. Additional studies are required in order to be able to identify relations between exposure to and adverse effects of cooking fumes. Dr. philos. Dr. philos...|$|E

Aims : The purpose of this experimental study was to, histologically and histometrically, evaluate the bone repair process in the central <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>extraction</b> sockets filled with platelet-rich plasma. Materials and Methods: Four young adult male Cebus apella monkeys were used. The <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> both right and left inferior second premolars was accomplished.
