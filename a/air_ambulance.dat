5|$|The Worcestershire County <b>Air</b> <b>Ambulance,</b> {{which has}} been {{operating}} since 1991, moved to the Strensham site in 1998 under a sponsorship deal with Take a Break, who were operating the service area at the time. Access to the <b>air</b> <b>ambulance</b> site {{can be made from}} the service station itself or from the local road network via the staff entrance to the services. An open day is held at the site each year {{to raise money for the}} operation of the <b>air</b> <b>ambulance.</b> In May 2008 the operational hours of the service was increased from 12 to 14 hours each day, as a result of this, landing lights needed to be installed at the base to enable night time use.|$|E
5|$|Access to an <b>air</b> <b>ambulance</b> base is at {{the rear}} of the site. The site also has a budget-chain hotel located within the service area. In May 2005 it was {{reported}} that the southbound services had overnight parking facilities for 100 lorries. This was a chargeable service.|$|E

5|$|Use of {{the airport}} area as a {{civilian}} airport was launched by Varangfly director Odd Bentzen in 1964. After visiting Iceland he proposed a series of short and simple airports in Finnmark which could serve the airline's <b>air</b> <b>ambulance</b> service. A different proposal was launched in 1966 by several of the larger airlines, including Scandinavian Airlines System, Braathens SAFE and Widerøe, to establish a network of short take-off and landing airports in rural areas; Berlevåg was one of six original proposals for Finnmark. A county committee was established in 1966 to look into building small airfields in Finnmark, including Berlevåg. In the following years the municipality made investments to allow the airfield {{to be used for}} <b>air</b> <b>ambulance</b> services. Part of the motivation was Berlevåg's poor port conditions, which often forced seaplanes to land at Kongsfjord.|$|E
5|$|Fixed-wing {{aircraft}} – These can be {{used for}} either acute emergency care in remote areas (such as in Australia, with the 'Flying Doctors'), for patient transport over long distances (e.g. a re-patriation following an illness or injury in a foreign country), or transportation between distant hospitals. Helicopter and fixed-wing ambulances are discussed in greater detail at <b>air</b> <b>ambulance.</b>|$|E

It {{is run by}} the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority and is the third largest fire service in the world. National Health Service ambulance services are provided by the London Ambulance Service (LAS) NHS Trust, the largest free-at-the-point-of-use emergency ambulance service in the world. The London <b>Air</b> <b>Ambulance</b> charity operates in conjunction with the LAS where required. Her Majesty's Coastguard and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution operate on the River Thames, which is {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Port of London Authority from Teddington Lock to the sea.|$|E
5|$|As the <b>air</b> <b>ambulance</b> {{prepares to}} land outside the {{emergency}} department a rotor blade is struck by a drone, causing the helicopter to crash land {{in the parking lot}} outside the hospital and into the back of an ambulance, causing the ambulance to knock scaffolding down over Alicia Munroe (Chelsea Halfpenny) and Ethan Hardy (George Rainsford). The tail of the helicopter smashes into the entrance of {{the emergency department}} causing brutal injuries. The department is shut down following the incident, with Connie and Grace’s lives prioritised. Grace is freed from the helicopter and taken into the department for treatment. Connie learns Grace has life-threatening injuries and may not survive surgery. The staff at Holby City come together to treat casualties of the accident. Grace survives surgery, but remains in a critical condition.|$|E
5000|$|Most <b>air</b> <b>ambulances</b> RWD-13S {{belonged to}} the Polish Red Cross, five to the Polish Air Force, but they carried {{civilian}} markings as well. Several (at least five) RWD-13, not counting <b>air</b> <b>ambulances,</b> were mobilized {{after the start of}} World War II and used as liaison aircraft during the Polish September Campaign.

5|$|Mining ceased in Ny-Ålesund in 1929; it {{was taken}} up again in 1941, {{but because of the}} Second World War the town was {{evacuated}} the following year. From 1946, the Royal Norwegian Air Force started serving Ny-Ålesund with their Consolidated PBY Catalina amphibian aircraft. The aircraft were able to land if there was no ice on the fjord and lighting and weather permitted it. The first flight took place on 10 May and consisted of post drops. No further flights were carried out until 1949; one of the flights that year was an <b>air</b> <b>ambulance</b> operation. The service also dropped post at the other Norwegian settlements in Svalbard. In 1961, the Catalinas were replaced with Grumman HU-16B Albatross aircraft.|$|E
