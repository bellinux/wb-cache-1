One explanation of such size effects which is frequently cited is formulated {{in terms of an}} interaction of assumptions, apparent distance, and retinal size. This interpretation is often associated with the transactionalist school (Kilpatrick, 1952) and may be called the neoempiristic viewpoint. An alternative explanation is possible which makes no mention of assumptions or apparent distance. Instead, the effects are seen to depend entirely on the relational properties of the proximal stimulus configuration. This interpretation may be designated as the relational view-If apparent size is relationally determined, then it follows that when the relational stimulus patterns which are being compared are not identical, the perceived size will not be identical as well.
