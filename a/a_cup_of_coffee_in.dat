500|$|The Mattachine Society and Daughters of Bilitis {{promoted}} non-confrontational {{education for}} homosexuals and heterosexuals, hoping {{to prove that}} homosexuals were respectable and normal. Living beyond the mostly white, middle class scope of these groups was an active community of cross-dressers, hustlers, and [...] "street queens" [...] who worked primarily in the Tenderloin district of the city. After being denied service at Gene Compton's Cafeteria, a few activists picketed the restaurant in 1966. A few days later, early in the morning, the police arrived to arrest patrons in drag. [...] A riot ensued when a drag queen threw the contents of <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>in</b> {{the face of a}} police officer in response to the officer's grabbing of her arm. The cafe's plate glass windows were shattered in the melée, and then again a few days later after they had been replaced. Although three years later the Stonewall Riots would have a more significant impact, the Compton's Cafeteria riots were among the first in American history where homosexuals and the newly forming transgender community fought against the authorities.|$|E

Rovi Corporation|accessdate=April 14, 2011}} In {{the beginning of the}} video, Morissette is at a gas station, walking to her automobile with <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>in</b> her hand. Then, she drives her car through a winter landscape, and she begins to sing the song's first verse. When it comes to the chorus, a second Morissette comes in. She is in a green sweater and sits in the backseat on the passenger side. When the first chorus ends, a third Morissette comes in, and she is in a yellow sweater with braided hair, also in the backseat, but on the driver's side. Along the way, the yellow Morissette is singing and eating at the same time, {{and when it comes to}} the second verse, a fourth and last Morissette comes in, she is in a red sweater sitting in the front passenger seat. During the second chorus, she climbs out of the window when they are still driving and almost gets knocked out by a bridge, but still manages a smile after doing so. The camera comes back to the driving Morissette, after the breakdown, and she takes off her hat, tosses it into the back seat, and becomes as loud as the other three while singing the song. When Morissette sings the outro, she is still driving through the winter landscape, and suddenly the car breaks down (possibly having run out of gas, which may be [...] "ironic" [...] in itself since the video started with her at a gas station). Morissette (as the driver) gets out of the car, and all her [...] "passengers" [...] have disappeared.|$|E
