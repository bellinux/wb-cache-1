5|$|Excavations in {{the acropolis}} {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} at least two superimposed platforms built with finely dressed stone blocks <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> good quality stucco flooring. At a later date the platforms and courtyard were covered with unworked stones bound with mortar <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> another stucco floor. The two platforms were built in the Late Classic and appear to have been covered over in the Terminal Classic.|$|E
5|$|As of 2016 the {{monument}} is regularly monitored and its lower part is cleaned <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> protective coating every five years. It is planned {{to carry out}} cleaning and restoration of entire monument in 2017.|$|E
5|$|A {{circular}} {{hole was}} {{cut into the}} backdrop <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> a transparent material. A strong light behind this hole represented the moon. The light was occasionally manipulated to suggest the passage of clouds. Gautier and St. Georges wanted the pool {{to be made of}} large mirrors but Pillet rejected this idea because of its cost. In the 1868 revival, however, mirrors were acquired for this scene.|$|E

5|$|Calbovista is a fungal genus {{containing}} the single species Calbovista subsculpta, {{commonly known as}} the sculptured puffball, sculptured giant puffball, and warted giant puffball. It is a common puffball of the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Coast ranges of western North America. The puffball is more or less round with a diameter of up to , white becoming brownish in age, <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> shallow pyramid-shaped plates or scales. It fruits singly or in groups along roads and in open woods at high elevations, from summer to autumn.|$|E
5|$|In 1998 {{management}} of the Tomaree National Park, in which the lighthouse is located, {{was transferred to the}} National Parks and Wildlife Service and the tower received some long due restoration, which completed in October 1998. At a cost of 85,000 the walls were cleaned <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> a special waterproof membrane system, the cast steel staircase refitted and the lantern room resealed for waterproofing.|$|E
5|$|Incubation {{takes two}} weeks. The hatched young, called squabs, are {{strongly}} altricial, being helpless at hatching <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> down. Both parents feed the squabs pigeon's milk (dove's milk) {{for the first}} 3–4 days of life. Thereafter, the crop milk is gradually augmented by seeds. Fledging takes place in about 11–15 days, before the squabs are fully grown but after {{they are capable of}} digesting adult food. They stay nearby to be fed by their father for up to two weeks after fledging.|$|E

5|$|Mammillaria species tend to grow low to {{the ground}} in solitary or grouped in clusters. The genus is marked by its dimorphic areoles: the spine bearing, or vegetative, areoles are located on the apex of the tubercle, and {{flowering}} areoles are located inside the axils of the tubercles. The stem is woolly <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> bristles.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{remains of}} the {{original}} dome built by Abd al-Malik. The present-day dome was built by az-Zahir and consists of wood plated with lead enamelwork. In 1969, the dome was reconstructed in concrete <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> anodized aluminum, instead of the original ribbed lead enamel work sheeting. In 1983, the aluminum outer covering was replaced with lead to match the original design by az-Zahir.|$|E
5|$|The Yavapai built brush shelter {{dwellings}} called Wa'm bu nya:va (Wom-boo-nya-va). In summer, {{they built}} simple lean-tos without walls. During winter months, closed huts (called uwas) {{would be built}} of ocotillo branches or other wood <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> animal skins, grasses, bark, and/or dirt. In the Colorado River area, Ɖo:lkabaya built Uwađ a'mađva, a rectangular hut, that had dirt piled up against its sides for insulation, and a flat roof. They also sought shelter in caves or abandoned pueblos to escape the cold.|$|E

5|$|The {{mineral springs}} of the Borjomi valley were {{discovered}} over one thousand years ago. Seven large rock tubs discovered by archeologists {{dating back to}} the beginning of the 7th century attest to the availability and use of the spring waters, most likely for bathing purposes. The springs were abandoned before being rediscovered in the early 19th century. By that time, as a result of the incessant warfare, Borjomi and its environs had been depopulated <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> impassable forests.|$|E
5|$|The spores are thin-walled, {{elliptical}} with narrowed ends, <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> fine warts; {{they have}} dimensions of 10–22 by 8–10μm. Both the spores and the asci (spore-bearing cells) are nonamyloid. The asci are narrow and typically 275–300μm long. The paraphyses (sterile cells interspersed among the asci in the hymenium) are slender threadlike. Ultrastructural {{studies have demonstrated}} that the development of the spore wall in G.rufa is similar to the genus Discina (in the Helvellaceae family) and to the other Sarcosomataceae, especially Plectania nannfeldtii; both of these species have fine secondary wall spore ornaments.|$|E
5|$|Viewed with a microscope, {{the wall}} of the {{apothecium}} is made of three tissue layers of roughly equal thickness. The first layer of tissue is black, leathery and compact, <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> a fine layer of brownish-black hairs (a tomentum); the second layer consists of loosely interlaced brown hyphae suspended in a gelatinous matrix. The third layer is the fertile, spore-bearing surface, the brownish-black hymenium.|$|E

5|$|When {{designing}} the exterior, Pei {{borrowed from the}} tradition of Japanese temples, particularly those found in nearby Kyoto. He created a concise spaceframe wrapped into French limestone <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> a glass roof. Pei also oversaw specific decorative details, including {{a bench in the}} entrance lobby, carved from a 350-year-old keyaki tree. Because of Koyama's considerable wealth, money was rarely considered an obstacle; estimates at the time of completion put the cost of the project at US$350million.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, the shark kills {{a young boy}} named Alex Kintner and an old man {{not far from the}} shore. A local fisherman, Ben Gardner, is sent by Amity's {{authorities}} to kill the shark but disappears on the water. Brody and deputy Leonard Hendricks find Gardner's boat anchored off-shore, empty, <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> large bite holes, one of which has a massive shark tooth stuck in it. Blaming himself for these deaths, Brody again tries to close the beaches, while Meadows investigates the Mayor's business contacts to determine why he wants to keep the beaches open. Meadows uncovers links to the Mafia, who pressure Vaughn to keep the beaches open {{in order to protect the}} value of Amity's real estate, in which the Mafia invested a great deal of money. Meadows also recruits marine biologist Matt Hooper from the Woods Hole Institute to advise them on how to deal with the shark.|$|E
5|$|A {{survey in}} 1932 {{found that the}} roof was cracked and it {{eventually}} collapsed in 1935. In 1936 the roof structure was straightened, preserving the medieval trusses where possible, <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> clay tiles. The restoration was undertaken by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, with the work being funded by Roger Clark of the local shoemakers C. & J. Clark who bought the derelict barn for £5. It has been owned by the National Trust since 1938. Designation as a Grade I listed building first took place in 1961. A survey in 2002 found minor repairs were needed to the doors and wall plate.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{exterior}} of the Pont du Gard is rough and relatively unfinished, the builders took care to ensure that the interior of the water conduit was as smooth as possible so that the flow of water would not be obstructed. The walls of the conduit were constructed from dressed masonry and the floor from concrete. Both were covered with a stucco incorporating minute shards of pottery and tile. It was painted with olive oil <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> maltha, a mixture of slaked lime, pork grease and the viscous juice of unripe figs. This produced a surface that was both smooth and durable.|$|E
5|$|Arbroath smokies, {{for which}} Arbroath is {{well-known}} nationally and internationally, are made solely in Arbroath following the award of Protected Geographical Indication in 2004, which limits Arbroath smokie production to within 4km of Arbroath. Smokies {{are made from}} haddock using traditional methods {{dating back to the}} late 19th century where the fish are first salted overnight to preserve them, before being left tied in pairs to dry. Next, the dried fish are hung in a special barrel containing a hardwood fire <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> a lid. After around an hour of smoking, the fish are golden brown and ready to eat. The preparation of smokies remains a cottage industry in Arbroath, centred almost exclusively at the harbour area. However, one larger processor, RR Spink, supplied Arbroath smokies to several UK supermarket chains. It appears that, nowadays, the firm concentrates on smoking other fish such as salmon or trout and no longer supplies the Arbroath Smokie. The company holds the Royal Warrant as a fishmonger to the Queen.|$|E
5|$|As intended, {{it would}} have functioned as a stealth helicopter, {{incorporating}} {{a number of different}} techniques and technologies in order to reduce its radar cross-section (RCS) along with other areas of visibility and detectability. The exterior surfaces of the RAH-66 were faceted <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> both radar-absorbent material (RAM) coatings and infrared-suppressant paint; {{as a result of these}} combined measures, the Comanche's RCS was claimed to have been 360 times smaller than that of the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter. The acoustic signature of the rotorcraft was also reported to be noticeably lower than comparative helicopters; this reduction had been partially achieved through the adoption of an all-composite five-blade main rotor and pioneering canted tail rotor assembly.|$|E
