50|$|The film {{is highly}} symbolic, making {{frequent}} use of religious and folkloric images that include crosses, lambs, graves, and spirits. The film also uses color to represent mood. During Ivan's period of mourning, black and white film stock is used. In other scenes, colors are often muted, but provide a contrast to vivid use of red and yellow. On its release, the film's presentation contrasted with the common socialist realism style that had government <b>approval.</b> After <b>refusing</b> to change the film, Parajanov was soon blacklisted from Soviet cinema.|$|R

In the early 1990s, Smith's attempted a major expansion into the Southern California market which was completely unsuccessful and resulted in Smith's accumulating nearly $500 million in debt.|$|R
5000|$|The railway {{was taken}} over by South Eastern Railway by an Act of Parliament of 28 July 1884. [...] A double track line was built and work began in 1884 and the first stage, from Shorncliffe (now Folkestone West) to Barham opened on 4 July 1887. The stretch from Barham to Canterbury was more {{difficult}} as rich landowners objected to trains passing through their land. The most stubborn was Matthew Bell who refused to see trains pass by the back of his mansion, and reluctantly the SER agreed to build Bourne Park tunnel instead of two bridges. In Canterbury, the South Eastern Railway wanted a station close to Wincheap but the necessary parliamentary <b>approval</b> was <b>refused,</b> so the South Eastern had to site its Canterbury South station much further south. Canterbury was reached in 1890 where it joined the Ashford - Ramsgate line at Harbledown Junction.|$|R
50|$|The court first {{considered}} the proper {{scope of the}} duties that section 7(1)(a) and (b) of the Act imposes on a local authority. On a proper interpretation of section 7(1)(a), the local authority must <b>refuse</b> <b>approval</b> of plans where the plans do not comply with the Act and any other applicable law, and also when the local authority remains in doubt as to {{the scope of the}} plans. Thus, the test imposed by section 7(1)(a) requires the local authority to be positively satisfied that the parameters of the test laid down are met.|$|R
50|$|Cristescu closely {{monitored}} the significant spy networks operating on Romanian soil during the war—Allied {{as well as}} German. Relations with Germany were fairly steady until November 1942, when changes on the Eastern Front led the SSI, at Cristescu’s order, to cultivate links with the Allies’ intelligence services. Of particular note was Operation Autonomous, in which three British agents were parachuted into Romania on 23 December 1943, captured, and interrogated directly by Cristescu (with Antonescu’s <b>approval),</b> who <b>refused</b> to hand them over for questioning in Berlin. Using the three, over the following months Cristescu bargained with the SOE, holding out {{the prospect of an}} armistice whereby Romania would switch sides in the war. He was aware of the secret armistice negotiations being undertaken by the leaders of the political opposition with the British and the Americans. Germany pressed for their arrest, but Cristescu (again so directed by Antonescu) assured them their protection and even took part in the discussions.|$|R

There she breaks up with Evan, sends for Gloria to take her back to East L.A, and quits being Captain of The Sea Lions.|$|R

However, when Fred Silverman became president of NBC in 1979, the project was scrapped.|$|R
30|$|In high-risk areas, {{vertical}} GSHP systems {{should be}} subject to strict quality measures or <b>approval</b> might be <b>refused.</b> Despite all potential risks, however, it would be not in the public interest to restrict the use of a technology that undoubtedly has economic and ecological benefits just because of previous (unnecessary) damage events. Thus, cross-border quality assurance has to be given highest priority. Negative impacts on groundwater and its quality should be investigated in detail in the laboratory and in the field. Especially the quality of backfilling materials and backfilling procedure, appropriate monitoring systems, and appropriate drilling techniques have to be improved.|$|R

5000|$|In {{parliamentary}} systems, {{approval is}} normally a formality, since {{the head of}} state is directed by an executive controlled by the legislature. In constitutional monarchies, this approval is called royal assent. In rare cases <b>approval</b> may be <b>refused</b> or [...] "reserved" [...] by {{the head of state}}'s use of a reserve power. The legislature may have significantly less power to introduce bills on such issues and may require the approval beforehand. In Commonwealth realms the royal prerogative informs this.

50|$|The Senate quickly met {{and began}} debating {{a change of}} government, but this {{eventually}} devolved into an argument over which {{of them would be}} the new princeps.

Some historians, particularly Josephus, claim that Claudius was directed in his actions by the Judaean King Herod Agrippa. However, an earlier version of events by the same ancient author downplays Agrippa's role so it remains uncertain. Eventually the Senate was forced to give in and, in return, Claudius pardoned nearly all the assassins.|$|R
50|$|In Paris, {{during the}} absence of John Byron, 1st Baron Byron in England, he obtained, through the influence, as it would seem, of Henry Jermyn, 1st Earl of St Albans, the post of {{temporary}} governor to the Duke of York (1648), and {{on the death of}} Byron (1652) took over the position. He acquired the control of the Duke's finances, and endeavoured to bring about a match between the Duke and Marie de Longueville, but the French court <b>refused</b> <b>approval.</b> Berkeley himself paid court to Anne Villiers, Countess of Morton, widowed in 1651; she turned him down, perhaps on advice from Sir Edward Hyde. Berkeley and Hyde became enemies.|$|R
50|$|The Marvel Rating System is {{a system}} for rating the content of comic books, with regard to {{appropriateness}} for different age groups. In 2001, Marvel Comics withdrew from the Comics Code Authority and established its own rating system for its publications.

As well, by withdrawing from the CCA, this {{is seen as a}} move by editor-in-chief Joe Quesada to lure more high-profile creators to Marvel Comics.

50|$|Marguerite {{appears to}} have written {{the first version of}} her book in the 1290s. Sometime between 1296 and 1306 it was deemed heretical, and the Bishop of Cambrai {{condemned}} it to be publicly burned in her presence at Valenciennes. One of the taboos Porete had broken was writing the book in Old French rather than in Latin and she was ordered not to circulate her ideas or the book again. Nevertheless, she continued to do so and in 1308 was arrested by the local Inquisitor (the Dominican William of Paris, also known as William of Humbert) on grounds of heresy, in spite of claims in the book that she had consulted three church authorities about her writings, including the highly respected Master of Theology Godfrey of Fontaines, and gained their <b>approval.</b> Marguerite <b>refused</b> to speak to William of Paris or any of her inquisitors during her imprisonment and trial. In 1310 a commission of twenty-one theologians investigated a series of fifteen propositions drawn from the book (only three of which are securely identifiable today), judging them heretical. Among those who condemned the book were the ecclesiastical textual scholar, Nicholas of Lyra.|$|R
