40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an <b>annotation</b> framework wherein the management {{process of the}} <b>annotation</b> guidelines is integrated into the <b>annotation</b> process.

40|$|A rich {{semantic}} {{model of}} <b>annotation</b> is presented that distinguishes several <b>annotation</b> types, uses controlled vocabulary where appropriate, and supports multi-facetted characterization of documents, <b>annotation</b> {{of parts of}} documents {{as well as of}} entire documents, and <b>annotation</b> of document associations besides <b>annotation</b> of single documents. This model has served as the ba- sis for implementing a powerful <b>annotation</b> system included in an advanced digital library system. ...|$|R

40|$|The right <b>annotation</b> tool {{does not}} always exist for {{processing}} a particular natural language task. In these scenarios, researchers are required to build new <b>annotation</b> tools to fit the tasks at hand. However, developing new <b>annotation</b> tools is difficult and inefficient. There has not been careful consideration of software complexity in current <b>annotation</b> tools. Due {{to the problems of}} complexity, new <b>annotation</b> tools must reimplement common <b>annotation</b> features despite the availability of implementations in open sourced tools. If new tools continue to ignore software complexity, their development will remain difficult and inefficient. This thesis advocates minimizing complexity for <b>annotation</b> tools in two ways: we raise awareness of complexity in <b>annotation</b> tools, and we propose our solution for assisting the development of simple <b>annotation</b> tools. We present our library, Notate, which provides simple implementations for building common features with in <b>annotation</b> tools...|$|R

In this paper, three image <b>annotation</b> approaches are reviewed: free text <b>annotation,</b> keyword <b>annotation</b> and <b>annotation</b> based on on-tologies. The practical aspects of image <b>annotation</b> are then considered. We discuss the creation of keyword vocabularies for use in automated image <b>annotation</b> eval-uation. As direct manual <b>annotation</b> of images requires much time and effort, we also review various methods to make the creation of ground truth more efficient.

5|$|The most {{complete}} {{books on the}} Pony Express are The Story of the Pony Express and Saddles and Spurs by Raymond & Mary Settle and Roy Bloss. Settle's account is unique as {{he was the first}} writer and historical researcher to make use of Pony Express founder William B. Waddell's papers, now in a collection at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. Mr. Settle wrote in the mid-1950s. Mr. Bloss was a writer for the Pony Express Centennial. While Settle's work was published generally without his <b>annotations</b> and notes, the writer's background here is unique and Settle does have an excellent bibliography. When Settle prepared to publish his well-researched account he had a good volume of footnotes, citations prepared, but the editors chose not to use most of them. Instead, they opted for a less expensive approach to print and publish and released an accurate, but simplified account. Settle was not pleased with this new and sudden development, as he put much time and effort into the <b>annotations.</b> Yet, the account Settle wrote was and is a definitive one and is considered the best account {{on the history of the}} Pony Express amongst many historians.|$|E

40|$|Consistency {{of corpus}} <b>annotation</b> is an {{essential}} property for the many uses of annotated corpora in computational and theoretical linguistics. While some research addresses the detection of inconsistencies in positional <b>annotation</b> (e. g., partof-speech) and continuous structural <b>annotation</b> (e. g., syntactic constituency), no approach has yet been developed for automatically detecting <b>annotation</b> errors in discontinuous structural <b>annotation.</b> This is significant since the <b>annotation</b> of potentially discontinuous stretches of material is increasingly relevant, from treebanks for free-word order languages to semantic and discourse <b>annotation.</b> In this paper we discuss how the variation n-gram error detection approach (Dickinson and Meurers, 2003 a) can be extended to discontinuous structural <b>annotation.</b> We exemplify the approach by showing how it successfully detects errors in the syntactic <b>annotation</b> of the German TIGER corpus (Brants et al., 2002). ...|$|R

5|$|The {{reception}} of the first edition was mixed, but within three years a second was made. The second edition used the more familiar term Testamentum instead of Instrumentum. In the second edition (1519) Erasmus also used Minuscule 3 (entire NT except Revelation; 12th century). The text was changed in about 400 places, with most—though not all—of the typographical errors corrected. Some new erroneus readings {{were added to the}} text. In this edition the text of Jerome's Vulgate Erasmus replaced by his own more elegant translation. The Latin translation had a good reception. After this edition, Erasmus was involved in many polemics and controversies. Particularly objectionable were the <b>annotations</b> from the universities of Cambridge and Oxford.|$|E
5|$|With {{the third}} edition of Erasmus's Greek text (1522) the Comma Johanneum was included. An often {{repeated}} {{story is that}} Erasmus included it, because he felt bound by a promise to include it if a manuscript was found that contained it. When a single 16th-century Greek manuscript subsequently had been found to contain it (Codex Montfortianus), Erasmus included it, though he expressed doubt as to {{the authenticity of the}} passage in his <b>Annotations.</b> Henk Jan de Jonge, a specialist in Erasmian studies, stated that there is no explicit evidence that supports this frequently made assertion concerning a specific promise made by Erasmus. The real reason to include the Comma by Erasmus, was his care for his good name and for the success of his Novum Testamentum.|$|E

40|$|Document <b>annotation</b> is an {{elementary}} {{task in the}} development of Text Mining applications, notably in defining the entities and relationships that are relevant to a given domain. Many <b>annotation</b> software tools have been implemented. Some are particular to a Text Mining framework while others are typical stand-alone tools. Regardless, most development efforts were driven to basic functionality, i. e. performing the <b>annotation,</b> and to interface, making sure operation was intuitive and visually appellative. The deployment of large-scale <b>annotation</b> jamborees and projects showed the need for additional features regarding inter- and intra-annotation management. Therefore, this paper presents Marky, a new Web-based document <b>annotation</b> tool that integrates a highly customisable <b>annotation</b> environment with a robust project management system. Novelty lays on the <b>annotation</b> tracking system, which supports per user and per round <b>annotation</b> change tracking and thus, enables automatic <b>annotation</b> correction and agreement analysis...|$|R
