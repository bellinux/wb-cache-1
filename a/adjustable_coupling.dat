40|$|Next {{generation}} precision machines {{will require}} ever more rigid elements {{to achieve the}} required machining tolerances. The presented work focuses on the application of ultra stiff servo-controllable kinematic couplings and hydrostatic bearings to minimize the structural loop of multi-axis precision grinding machines while reducing complexity. The fundamental importance of these ultra stiff, adjustable machine elements is demonstrated {{in the design of}} a grinding machine for 450 mm diameter silicon wafers. A new generation of silicon wafer grinding machines is needed to back-grind large (450 mm diameter) wafers from the production thickness of up to 1 mm down to less than 50 pm so as to reduce the cost of Si-wafer based components. The grinding process {{needs to be done in}} about 90 sec (fine-grinding, e. g. - 200 micron) to 160 sec (coarse grinding, e. g. - 600 micron). After completion of the fine grinding process the wafer must be flat to 0. 1 pm/o 45 mm and parallel to 0. 6 pm/ 450 mm diameter. The surface roughness must be less than Rymax 0. 1 pm and Ra 0. 01 pm. Even though the required machining forces are 1 N/nm is required, which is many times stiffer than a typical machine tool (0. 1 to 0. 3 N/nm). In cooperation with industry, this work had the aim of creating a new machine design philosophy, with an example application that focuses on nano-adjustable kinematic coupling and feedback controlled water hydrostatic bearing technology. This new design philosophy is needed to enable the design of a relatively small footprint, compact precision machines. In particular, a ball screw preloaded height <b>adjustable</b> kinematic <b>coupling</b> and a magnetically preloaded hydrostatic thrust bearing were designed and built. The <b>adjustable</b> kinematic <b>coupling</b> allows for up to 8 mm of vertical height adjust and 7 N/nm stiffness at 26 kN preload. By varying the preload on the coupling by +/- 10 %, in-process nm to micron height and tilt adjustment at > 95 % of the nominal stiffness is possible. Under the assumption of a constant flow supply, the hydrostatic bearing achieves a theoretical stiffness of 1 N/ nm at a 20 micron bearing gap and 7000 N combined gravitational and magnetic preload. In practice, the stiffness is limited by the pressure flow characteristics of the supplying pumps. To increase the bearing stiffness to a required 4 N/ nm, various control loops have been developed and tested. by Gerald RothenhÃ¶fer. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The nominal design {{gradient}} in {{the main}} linacs of the International Linear Collider (ILC) is 31. 5 MV/m for a beam current of 9. 0 mA. However, the superconducting cavities built to date have demonstrated a range in sustainable gradient extending well below this goal, being limited by Q drop-off and quenching. Thus, an economically feasible cavity acceptance rate will include {{a certain percentage of}} sub-performing cavities. An important question {{that needs to be addressed}} is, For a string of cavities rated to various levels of gradient and powered from a common source how can we optimize the overall gradient? Along with <b>adjustable</b> cavity <b>coupling</b> [...] or loaded Q factor [...] we assume adjustable RF power so that gradient can be leveled in nonnominal cavities, to avoid quench-inducing overshoots. In the ILC an RF unit comprises three cryomodules containing a total of 26 nine-cell cavities, which are fed by one klystron that nominally feeds equal power to all cavities. One simple way of running such a unit is to set RF power, beam arrival time, and all loaded Q's so that the power is matched and the gradient in all cavities equals the gradient limit in the poorest performing cavity. This conservative strategy, however, sacrifices gradient and can be improved upon. One improvement strategy is to adjust the cavity couplings individually (possible, since circulators are assumed in the baseline ILC design) or in pairs (when circulators are not needed) using the movable antennae of the fundamental mode couplers. Another strategy is to use variable power tap-offs (VTO's) [1] by which the RF power to succeeding pairs of cavities can be made to differ. These solutions will not be matched, resulting in power inefficiency and a gradient variation along the beam that needs to be limited. In this report we study the effect on overall gradient for various combinations of these ideas. Deciding which strategy is best can then be done by balancing gradient with the cost and complexity of hardware such as circulators and variable power tap-offs...|$|R
