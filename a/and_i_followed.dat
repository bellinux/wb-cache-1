500|$|Peterson's {{most famous}} {{commercials}} were his [...] "Wake up! Wake up!" [...] spots, which began airing in the mid-1970s. Peterson borrowed the idea from another retailer in Corpus Christi, Texas. Said Peterson, [...] "Somebody {{told me about}} it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>followed</b> it up. Ours was much more successful than theirs. They didn't have the store owner or a strong personality doing theirs." [...] Peterson kept his stores open from 11 a.m. to 3 a.m. to accommodate customers inspired by the ad to visit his store late at night. The commercial ran less frequently in the 1980s, and last aired in 1988.|$|E
500|$|Gil is a tenor, but {{he sings}} in the {{baritone}} or falsetto register, with lyrics and/or scat syllables. His lyrics are on subjects {{that range from}} philosophy to religion, folktales, and word play. Gil's musical style incorporates {{a broad range of}} influences. The first music he was exposed to included The Beatles and street performers in various metropolitan areas of Bahia. During his first years as a musician, Gil performed primarily in a blend of traditional Brazilian styles with two-step rhythms, such as baião and samba. He states that [...] "My first phase was one of traditional forms. Nothing experimental at all. Caetano [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>followed</b> in the tradition of Luiz Gonzaga and Jackson do Pandeiro, combining samba with northeastern music." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "My family", Black {{wrote in}} 2009, [...] "was divided between atheism and agnosticism, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>followed</b> rather unthinkingly and inactively in those paths into my twenties." [...] By his early thirties he [...] "no longer had any {{confidence}} in the non-existence of God." [...] Thereafter, he [...] "approached Rome at a snail's pace," [...] and began to study the writings of Roman Catholic thinkers such as St. Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Cardinal Newman, and Jacques Maritain. Having accepted the possibility of miracles and thus of the Resurrection of Christ, Black was received into the Roman Catholic Church on 18 June 1986 by Cardinal Gerald Emmett Carter, Archbishop of Toronto, at the Cardinal's residence. He had a dispensation to receive the sacraments of the Roman Catholic Church, from Cardinal Leger and Cardinal Carter, starting in 1974.|$|E

[...] "My aunts constantly told me I was stupid, which still affects me today pretty badly. It’s just a belief that I’m not quite as good as anyone else. It gets worse as you get older. I’m a happy man now but I still have the scars of that." [...] Regarding his sister, Connolly has called her his [...] "great defender". [...] "To this day, he explained in 2009, [...] "Guys say, 'God, your sister... We didn't dare beat you up – your sister was a nightmare'. She used to get after them."
