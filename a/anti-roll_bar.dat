5|$|The final race in Europe {{took place}} at Monza. Ferrari's early bid to put Fernando Alonso on pole {{position}} by way of using Felipe Massa to offer him a slipstream ended in disaster when Alonso's rear <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar</b> failed in the final period of qualifying, leaving the championship leader marooned in tenth while Lewis Hamilton took pole. Hamilton asserted early control over the race, and while Ferrari made significant ground early on to be running second and third – despite losing the data uplink between their cars and the pit wall that provided them with telemetry – it was Sergio Pérez who proved to be Hamilton's biggest challenge. Starting outside the top ten, Pérez elected to start on the harder compound tyres and complete one stop, producing fastest lap after fastest lap as McLaren's confidence was broken when Jenson Button's car was paralysed by a fuel pressure problem. Hamilton would ultimately prevail, but {{he was forced to}} push in the final few laps to maintain his lead, and won the race by four seconds as Pérez claimed his third podium of the season with second place. Alonso went on to finish third, benefiting from Button's retirement and a drive-through penalty for Sebastian Vettel when the reigning World Champion forced him so wide through the Curva Grande that Alonso was forced off the circuit. Bruno Senna later criticised the race stewards for not penalising Paul di Resta for a similar altercation on the approach to the Variante della Roggia early in the race. Meanwhile, with Romain Grosjean serving his suspension, Lotus enlisted former Marussia F1 driver Jérôme d'Ambrosio as their second driver for the weekend. He qualified sixteenth, and went on to finish thirteenth overall.|$|E
5|$|Sebastian Vettel's {{momentum}} continued {{one week}} later in Korea, winning his third consecutive race and taking a six-point championship lead as Fernando Alonso finished third. Vettel overcame pole-sitter Mark Webber at the start, and was aided in building up a lead by first-lap contact between Jenson Button, Nico Rosberg and Kamui Kobayashi that saw Button and Rosberg retire with damage from the collision; Rosberg pulled over on the approach to the third turn, forcing a protracted yellow flag period as marshalls attempted to retrieve his car. With the sporting regulations banning overtaking while yellow flags were shown, the field was effectively thinned out in the opening laps as drivers were unable to pass one another. Tyre management {{became the focus of}} the race, as drivers reported heavy graining, particularly on the right-front tyre, which bore most of the load over a lap of the circuit. Vettel ignored six radio calls from his pit wall cautioning him that a tyre failure was imminent, only backing off just enough in the final few laps to secure victory over Webber by six seconds. The team later denied that there had ever been a problem with Vettel's tyres. Further down the order, Scuderia Toro Rosso's Jean-Éric Vergne and Daniel Ricciardo fought their way from sixteenth and twenty-first on the grid to finish eighth and ninth, while Romain Grosjean drove a conservative race to finish seventh, having been warned beforehand by the stewards that another first-lap altercation would likely result in his disqualification from the race. Lewis Hamilton's day went from bad to worse when an <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar</b> on his McLaren failed, while the car handled its tyres so poorly that he was forced to make an unscheduled stop {{in order to make it}} to the finish, only to tear up a length of astroturf that wreaked havoc on his downforce and he slid down to tenth place, narrowly fending off an opportunistic charge from Sergio Pérez to take the final World Championship point on offer. Button's retirement and Hamilton's single point meant that McLaren lost second place in the World Constructors' Championship to Ferrari, and Hamilton admitted that his bid to be the 2012 World Drivers' Champion was over.|$|E
25|$|A notable {{advantage}} of the FRP transverse leaf springs—when supported with widely spaced, pivotable mounts—is the ability to supplement or replace the <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar.</b> Typically springs that provide a sufficient ride rate need a supplemental spring (the <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar)</b> to increase the suspension roll rate. The coupling of {{the two sides of}} the transverse leaf spring across the vehicle results in an <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar</b> like behavior. Corvette engineers have cited this property as enabling the use of a lighter <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar,</b> and even eliminating the rear <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar</b> on some versions of the seventh generation Corvette.|$|E
40|$|International audienceRollover is a {{very serious}} problem for heavy vehicle safety, which can result in large {{financial}} and environmental consequences. In order to improve roll stability, most of modern heavy vehicles are equipped with passive <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bars</b> to reduce roll motion during cornering or riding on uneven roads. This paper introduces the active <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bars</b> designed by finding an optimal control based on a linear quadratic regulator (LQR). Four electronic servo valve hydraulic dampers are modelled and applied on a yaw roll model of a single unit heavy vehicle. The control signal is the current entering the electronic servo valve and the output of this actuator is the damping force generated by the hydraulic damper. Simulation results are obtained and compared in three different situations: without <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bars,</b> with passive <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bars</b> and with active <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bars.</b> It is shown that the use of two active (front and rear) <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bars</b> drastically improves the behaviour of the single unit heavy vehicle...|$|R
50|$|<b>Anti-roll</b> <b>bars</b> were unusual on pre-war cars {{due to the}} {{generally}} much stiffer suspension and acceptance of body roll. From the 1950s, production cars were more commonly fitted with <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bars,</b> especially those with softer coil spring suspension.|$|R
40|$|Rollover {{of heavy}} vehicle is an {{important}} road safety problem world-wide. Although rollovers are relatively rare events, they are usually deadly accidents when they occur. In order to improve roll stability, most of modern heavy vehicles are equipped with passive <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bars</b> to reduce roll motion during cornering or riding on uneven roads. This paper proposes an H∞ approach to design active <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bars</b> using the yaw-roll model of a single unit heavy vehicle. The control signals are the torques generated by the actuators at {{the front and rear}} axles. Simulation results in both frequency and time domains are provided to compare two different cases: passive <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bars</b> and H∞ active <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bars.</b> It is shown that the use of two H∞ active (front and rear) <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bars</b> drastically improves the roll stability of the single unit heavy vehicle to prevent rollover. © 201...|$|R
25|$|The {{suspension}} was upgraded {{with the}} addition of a rear <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar,</b> essentially the same bar as used on the Oldsmobile 442 and Buick Gran Sport. The front <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar</b> was slightly stiffer. The result was a useful reduction in body lean in turns and a modest reduction of understeer.|$|E

40|$|Active <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bars</b> have {{recently}} found greater acceptance among premium car manufacturers and optimal {{application of this}} technology has emerged as an important field of research. This thesis investigates the potential of implementing active <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bars</b> in a passenger vehicle {{with the purpose of}} increasing customer value. For active <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bars,</b> customer value is defined in terms of vehicle’s ride comfort and handling performance. The objective with this thesis is to demonstrate this value through development of a control algorithm that can reflect the potential improvement in ride comfort and handling. A vehicle with passive <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bars</b> is simulated for different manoeuvres to identify the potential and establish a reference {{for the development of a}} control algorithm and for the performance of active <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bars.</b> While ride is evaluated using single-sided cosine wave and single-sided ramps, handling is evaluated using standardized constant radius, frequency response and sine with dwell manoeuvres. The control strategy developed implements a combination of sliding mode control, feed forward and PI-controllers. Simulations with active <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bars</b> showed significant improvement in ride and handling performance in comparison to passive <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bars.</b> In ride comfort, the biggest benefit was seen in the ability to increase roll damping and isolating low frequency road excitations. For handling, most significant benefits are through the system’s ability of changing the understeer behaviour of the vehicle and improving the handling stability in transient manoeuvres. Improvement in the roll reduction capability during steady state cornering is also substantial. In conclusion, active <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bars</b> are undoubtedly capable of improving both ride comfort and handling performance of a vehicle. Although the trade-off between ride and handling performance is significantly less, balance in requirements is critical to utilise the full potential of active <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bars.</b> With a more comprehensive control strategy, they also enable the vehicle to exhibit different driving characteristics without the need for changing any additional hardware...|$|R

50|$|Roll {{couple is}} {{resisted}} by the suspension roll stiffness, {{which is a}} function of the spring rate of the vehicle's springs and of the <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bars,</b> if any. The use of <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bars</b> allows designers to reduce roll without making the suspension's springs stiffer in the vertical plane, which allows improved body control with less compromise of ride quality.|$|R
25|$|When either {{wheel is}} {{deflected}} upward, the center {{span of the}} spring (the portion between the pivotable mounts) deflects downward. If both wheels deflect upward {{at the same time}} (for example, when hitting a bump in the road) the center section bends uniformly between the pivot mounts. In a roll, only one wheel is deflected upwards, which tends to form the center of the spring into an S-shaped curve. The result is that the wheel rate of one side of the suspension depends on the displacement of the other side. The extent to which the spring acts as an <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar</b> depends on the distance between the pivot mounts and their rigidity.|$|E

25|$|As {{with the}} Lotus Six before it, the {{original}} Lotus Seven used an extremely light space-frame chassis with stressed aluminium body panels. Although the chassis has had numerous modifications to strengthen it and accommodate the various engine and suspension setups (and {{to try to}} find more cockpit space for the occupants), this basic formula has remained essentially the same throughout the Seven's life (with the exception of the Series 4, which used steel for the cockpit and engine bay and glassfibre for the bodywork). Early cars used a live rear axle, initially from various Fords, later from the Morris Ital. De Dion rear suspension was introduced in the mid-1980s and both geometries were on offer until 2002 when the live-axle option was phased out. The modern Superlight employs adjustable double-wishbone suspension with front <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar</b> and a de-dion rear axle, located by an A-frame and Watt's linkage.|$|E

25|$|Nearly 21 {{hours into}} the race, Kristensen's No. 1 Audi slowed on course on several laps. After {{eventually}} returning to the garage Audi were forced to perform their second turbocharger replacement of the race as the No. 1 was hampered by the same issue that had stopped the No. 2's lead. This promoted Bernhard in the No. 20 Porsche to the race lead with the No. 2 Audi driven by Lotterer only {{a minute and a}} half behind the leader. Porsche's lead lasted only an hour though as it too slowed on the course suffering from a broken <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar</b> and was forced to the garage where it was eventually abandoned. The No. 14 Porsche of Lieb came to the garage half an hour later with gearbox issues after slowing at Mulsanne corner but returned to the race in the final half hour. The shake-up in LMP1 promoted the No. 2 Audi to the race lead, three laps ahead of di Grassi's No. 1 Audi and followed by Davidson's No. 8 Toyota, still recovering from its accident in the opening hours of the race. The attrition amongst LMP1 cars also allowed the No. 12 Rebellion Racing, the sole remaining LMP1-L car in the race, into fourth place overall. The ailing OAK Ligier of Brundle was also forced to abandon the LMP2 lead after being caught by the faster TDS Ligier of Gommendy and Harry Tincknell's Jota Zytek, before eventually having a lengthy stop for more work on the troubled engine which dropped them from contention.|$|E
25|$|The {{independent}} {{rear suspension}} Duntov created for Sting Ray was essentially a frame-mounted differential with U-jointed half-shafts tied together by a transverse leaf spring – a design derived from the CERV I concept. Rubber-cushioned struts carried the differential, which reduced ride harshness while improving tire adhesion, especially on rougher roads. The transverse spring was bolted {{to the rear of}} the differential case. A control arm extended laterally and slightly forward from each side of the case to a hub carrier, with a trailing radius rod mounted behind it. The half-shafts functioned like upper control arms. The lower arms controlled vertical wheel motion, while the trailing rods took care of fore/aft wheel motion and transferred braking torque to the frame. Shock absorbers were conventional twin-tube units. Considerably lighter than the old solid axle, the new rear suspension array delivered a significant reduction in unsprung weight, which was important since the 1963 model would retain the previous generation's outboard rear brakes. The new model's front suspension would be much as before, with unequal-length upper and lower A-arms on coil springs concentric with the shocks, plus a standard <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar.</b> Steering remained the conventional recirculating-ball steering design, but it was geared at a higher 19.6:1 overall ratio (previously 21.0:1). Bolted to the frame rail at one end and to the relay rod at the other was a new hydraulic steering damper (essentially a shock absorber), which helped soak up bumps before they reached the steering wheel. What's more, hydraulically assisted steering would be offered as optional equipment for the first time on a Corvette – except on cars with the two most powerful engines – and offer a faster 17.1:1 ratio, which reduced lock-to-lock turns from 3.4 to just 2.9.|$|E
