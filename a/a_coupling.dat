The transducer consists of a layer of piezoelectric material sandwiched transversally into <b>a</b> <b>coupling</b> rod or resonator.|$|E
5|$|When Germany {{surrendered}} to the Allies of World War I in November 1918, the German troops evacuated, allowing the surviving members of the imperial family time to escape abroad. The British warship HMS Marlborough rescued the Dowager Empress Marie {{and some of her}} family from the Crimea but Grand Duchess Olga and Kulikovsky decided to stay in Russia and travelled to the Caucasus region, where the Bolsheviks had been pushed back by the White Army. During the journey, <b>a</b> <b>coupling</b> on the train carriage in which they were travelling developed a fault, possibly from sabotage, and Kulikovsky crawled over the carriage roofs to reach the driver and stop the train. In the Caucasus, Kulikovsky took a job working on a farm as he was unable to secure a military posting in the White Army because the commanding general, Anton Denikin, wished to avoid association with the Romanovs. In a rented farmhouse at the large Cossack village of Novominskaya Olga and Kulikovsky's second son, Guri, was born on 23 April 1919. He was named after Guri Panaev, who had been killed serving in Olga's Akhtyrsky regiment. As the White Army was pushed back and the Red Army approached, the family set out on what would be their last journey through Russia; they travelled to Rostov-on-Don, and from there took refuge at Novorossiysk in the residence of the Danish consul, Thomas Schytte, who informed them of Dowager Empress Marie's safe arrival in Denmark.|$|E

In {{an example of a}} present-day cross coupling reaction called decarboxylative coupling, a catalytic amount of Cu(I) displaces a carboxyl group forming the arylcopper (ArCu) intermediate. Simultaneously, a palladium catalyst converts an aryl bromide to the organopalladium intermediate (Ar'PdBr), and on transmetallation the biaryl is formed from ArPdAr'.|$|E

25|$|The {{conformal}} symmetry {{is associated}} with the vanishing of the beta function. This can occur naturally if <b>a</b> <b>coupling</b> constant is attracted, by running, toward a fixed point at which β(g) = 0. In QCD, the fixed point occurs at short distances where g → 0 and is called a (trivial) ultraviolet fixed point. For heavy quarks, such as the top quark, it is calculated that the coupling to the mass-giving Higgs boson runs toward a fixed non-zero (non-trivial) infrared fixed point.|$|E
25|$|Substituted {{derivatives}} of hydroxylamine are known. If the hydroxyl {{hydrogen is}} substituted, {{this is called}} an O-hydroxylamine, {{if one of the}} amine hydrogens is substituted, this is called an N-hydroxylamine. Similarly to ordinary amines, one can distinguish primary, secondary and tertiary hydroxylamines, the latter two referring to compounds where two or three hydrogens are substituted, respectively. Examples of compounds containing a hydroxylamine functional group are N-tert-butyl-hydroxylamine or the glycosidic bond in calicheamicin. N,O-Dimethylhydroxylamine is <b>a</b> <b>coupling</b> agent, used to synthesize Weinreb amides.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to catabolic pathways, anabolic pathways require an energy input to construct macromolecules such as polypeptides, nucleic acids, proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids. The isolated reaction of anabolism is unfavorable {{in a cell}} due to a positive Gibbs Free Energy (+ΔG). Thus, an input of chemical energy through <b>a</b> <b>coupling</b> with an exergonic reaction is necessary. The coupled reaction of the catabolic pathway affects the thermodynamics of the reaction by lowering the overall activation energy of an anabolic pathway and allowing the reaction to take place. Otherwise, an endergonic reaction is non-spontaneous.|$|E

25|$|Also {{known as}} a Janney coupler and the buckeye coupler, the knuckle coupler is the {{derivative}} of <b>a</b> <b>coupling</b> device that links and connects rolling railway cars such as passenger, refrigerator, freight, and stock cars together on railroad track. The knuckle coupler have a bifurcated drawhead and a revolving hook, which, when brought in contact with another coupler, automatically interlocks with its mate. Knuckle couplers replaced the much more dangerous link-and-pin couplers and {{became the basis for}} standard coupler design {{for the rest of the}} 19th century. The knuckle coupler was invented and patented by Eli H. Janney in 1873.|$|E
25|$|Grafting to {{involves}} the strong adsorption or chemical bonding of a polymer molecule to a surface from solution. This process is typically achieved through <b>a</b> <b>coupling</b> agent that links {{a handle on}} the surface to a reactive group on either of the chain termini. Although simple, this approach suffers from the disadvantage of a relatively low grafting density as a result of steric hindrance from the already-attached polymer coils. After coupling, as in all cases, polymers attempt to maximize their entropy typically by assuming a brush or mushroom conformation. Thus, potential binding sites become inaccessible beneath this “mushroom domain”.|$|E

25|$|The {{fifth wheel}} {{coupling}} provides a pivoting link between a semi-trailer and the towing truck, tractor unit, leading trailer or dolly.

The coupling consists of <b>a</b> <b>coupling</b> pin (or kingpin) {{on the front of the}} semi-trailer, and a horseshoe-shaped coupling device called a fifth wheel on the rear of the towing vehicle.
