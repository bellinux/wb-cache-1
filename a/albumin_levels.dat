40|$|Aim: Hypoalbuminemia and {{systemic}} inflammatory response (SIR) parameters {{are a key}} role in the prognosis of cancer patients. We aim to investigate the changes of serum <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> and SIR after chemotherapy, in patients with inoperable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The hypothesis is that improved serum <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> may be beneficial to the SIR parameters and will reduce chemotherapy-induced toxicity. Patients and Methods: Forty-nine stage III b or stage IV inoperable NSCLC patients were divided into two groups, depending on whether albumin administration was given before chemotherapy. The Karnofsky performance score (KPS), nutritional status including body mass index (BMI), and serum <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> were evaluated. SIR was evaluated by investigating the changes of the C-reactive protein (CRP), calculating the neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and the platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR), before and after chemotherapy. The chemotherapy-induced toxicity was also evaluated. Results: In the group of patients without albumin administration before chemotherapy, the serum <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> was significantly decreased (P 0. 05), even though the patients may have been malnourished or diagnosed with pleural effusions. There were no significant changes in the SIR parameters. Conclusion: Early assessment of the serum <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> in patients with inoperable NSCLC and their improvement in the serum <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> may suggest that there are beneficial effects after chemotherapy...|$|R

40|$|Background: Dengue {{infection}} {{has been}} a major health problem in the world with high morbidity and mortality. Dengue infection has variable in clinical spectrum from mild to severe degree. It is presumed that total cholesterol <b>level</b> and <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> have correlation with degree of dengue infection. Aim: To evaluate the correlation between total cholesterol <b>level</b> and <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> with degree of dengue infection. Method: This was an observational analitic study with cross sectional design. The population of this research were pediatric patients with dengue infection who were treated in pediatric ward, Hospitals in Semarang from April-July 2012. Samples were divided into two groups, non DSS and DSS groups. Non DSS group consisted of DHF I and DHF II, whereas DSS group consisted of DHF III and DHF IV. Samples were measured for total cholesterol <b>level</b> and <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> when defervescence occured. Correlation between total cholesterol <b>level</b> and <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> with degree of dengue infection were analyzed by Spearman Rank test, and intergroup difference was analyzed by Anova one way test.

It is assumed that the presence of EV detected though examination of serum <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> may trim down the unnecessary endoscopy. This study was aimed to recognize the correlation between <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> and the degree of EV in patients with liver cirrhosis. Method: A retrospective analysis was performed for 61 patients with liver cirrhosis who had EGD at Sanglah hospital between January and December 2008. Spearman test was used to analyze the correlation between <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> and the degree of EV. Results: There were 61 patients of 45 (73. 8 %) male and 16 (26. 2 %) female. The range age of patients was 13 – 77 years (average 49. 98 ± 1. 62 years). Serum <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> ranged between 1. 10 - 3. 60 mg/dL, the average value was 2. 21 ± 0. 451 mg/dL. We also found 8 (13. 1 %) patients without EV, 14 (23. 0 %) patients with EV grade I, 21 (34. 4 %) patients with grade II and 18 (29. 5 %) patients with grade III. A negative correlation was found between serum <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> and the degree of EV (r = - 0. 587; p = 0. 000, p < 0. 01).

40|$|Discussions whether hypoalbuminemia is just {{a marker}} for the malnutrition-inflammation {{syndrome}} {{as well as for}} the increased morbidity and mortality of those patients or is it an etiological factor, are becoming more and more intense. In this research of the relation between hypoalbuminemia and the complications that threaten the vascular access with special reference to infection, and consequently to the life of the patients treated with chronic haemodialysis, we have chosen 120 patients with terminal renal insufficiency (ESRD) treated at the Clinical Hospital Mostar by chronic haemodialysis. The chosen patients for this study were observed throughout a time period of 18 months. Only the patients who, at the moment of starting the research did not exhibit either a local or a systemic infection, as well as no signs of any other complication that might have endangered the vascular access and consequently the life of the patient, were selected. From the 120 (100. 0 %) patients, 86. 8 % of them had a serum <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> below 40, 0 g/L. By analysing the research results of the clinical material, it has been established that in patients with serum <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> below 40. 0 g/L, the infection incidence was significantly higher than in those patients with the <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> above 40. 0 g/L (c 2 = 7. 215 P = 0. 0077). The complication incidence is significantly higher (c 2 = 9. 92 P = 0. 0022) among the patients with serum <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> below 40. 0 g/L, than in those patients with higher serum level.

The mean <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> in this population was 3. 9 g/dl (standard deviation 0. 3). During 5. 2 years of follow-up, 470 incident CHD events occurred. The hazard ratio for incident CHD associated with a 1 -standard deviation decrease in serum <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> was 1. 26 (95 % confidence interval (Cl) : 1. 15, 1. 38) after adjustment for age, gender, and ethnicity and 1. 18 (95 % Cl: 1. 07, 1. 30) after additional adjustment for covariates related to CHD. Hazard ratios were similar across gender and ethnic groups. However, there was statistically significant effect modification by smoking status, with hazard ratios of 1. 01 (95 % Cl: 0. 84, 1. 22) among never smokers, 1. 09 (95 % Cl: 0. 92, 1. 30) among former smokers, and 1. 35 (95 % Cl: 1. 17, 1. 54) among current smokers.

40|$|Background/PurposeIfosfamide, {{a widely}} used {{chemotherapeutic}} agent, has been frequently associated with encephalopathy. A larger-scale {{study was conducted}} to identify risk factors of ifosfamide-related encephalopathy, including hepatic function. MethodsAdult patients who had completed at least one cycle of ifosfamide between January 2008 and December 2010 were included. Those with renal failure or liver failure were excluded. Data were collected through chart review. Patients with encephalopathy and patients without encephalopathy were compared on age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS), baseline serum creatinine (SCr) <b>level,</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level,</b> white blood cell count, liver function, brain metastasis, and dosage of ifosfamide. Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, Student t test, and univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used for analysis. ResultsThis study enrolled 337 patients. Thirty-eight patients (11 %) had ifosfamide-related encephalopathy. They had poorer ECOG PS; higher SCr level, white blood cell count, and aspartate aminotransferase level; and lower serum <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> compared with patients without encephalopathy. Ifosfamide dosage, brain metastasis, and age were not significant risk factors. Multivariate analysis indicated that only ECOG PS, SCr <b>level,</b> and <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> contributed significantly to the risk. ConclusionTo date, this is the largest-scale study to have analyzed the risk factors of ifosfamide-related encephalopathy. This study confirms that an ECOG PS of 2 – 4 and increased SCr level are significant risk factors of ifosfamide-related encephalopathy, whereas increased <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> decreases the risk, consistent with previous reports.
