5|$|In 1919, the {{legislature}} passed the Aldrich Act; {{combined with the}} approval of the Bond Issue Act during an election that April, the MSHD was authorized to assume responsibility over the roadways that composed the State Trunkline Highway System. The state highway commissioner was required to sign the state trunkline highways, and Michigan become the second state after Wisconsin to do so. Alan Williams, Ionia County engineer, helped to design the diamond marker used to sign the highways; he is also known for placing <b>a</b> <b>picnic</b> <b>table</b> alongside US16 (Grand River Avenue) in 1929 south of Saranac, considered the first in the country. Other sources say that the first roadside park in the country was created by Herbert Larson near what is now US2 near Iron River in 1919–20. The first crows nest traffic tower in the US was installed at the intersection of Woodward and Michigan avenues in Detroit on October 9, 1917. The tower elevated a police officer above the center of the intersection to direct traffic before it was replaced in October 1920 with the world's first four-way traffic light.|$|E

5|$|The {{first state}} {{trunkline}} highway designated {{along the path}} of the modern US2 was M‑12, a designation that was in use by July 1, 1919, between Ironwood and Sault Ste. Marie. The first roadside park in the country was created by Herbert Larson near what is now US2 near Iron River in 1919–20, although other sources state that the first was <b>a</b> <b>picnic</b> <b>table</b> alongside US16 (Grand River Avenue) in 1929 south of Saranac. When the US Highway System was created on November 11, 1926, US2 partially replaced M-12. Between Crystal Falls and Iron Mountain, US2 was routed through Florence, Wisconsin. The former routing of M‑12 from Crystal Falls to Sagola became a new M‑69 when the former M‑69 became US102 (now US141). M‑12 from Sagola south to Iron Mountain was made a part of an extended M‑45, which is now M‑95. By the next year, M‑48 was added along US2 from Rexton to Garnet {{as part of a larger}} extension.|$|E

500|$|In 1929, Allan Williams placed <b>a</b> <b>picnic</b> <b>table</b> on {{the side}} of the road along US16 south of Saranac. Williams was the Ionia County {{engineer}} in charge of the various roads in the county, and that location is [...] "what many consider to be the nation's first roadside table". The first change to the US16 routing was made in 1933 when the highway was moved to bypass Farmington, with the old routing retained as a state highway. The next year, in 1934, M-126 was created between Nunica and Muskegon. In 1940, US16 was rerouted to replace M-126, and the former route of US16 between Nunica and Grand Haven was redesignated M-104. Two further changes during 1941–42 rerouted the western end in Muskegon to end at the car ferry docks. Previously, motorists had to navigate from the western end along other roads to the ferry connection to the rest of US16 in Wisconsin. The second change routed Bypass US16 (Byp. US16) along 28th Street and Wilson (previously the South Beltline and West Beltline sections of M-114) in the Grand Rapids area. The US16 designation was moved in 1953 to replace Byp. US16 while the former routing through downtown Grand Rapids was redesignated Business US16 (Bus. US16).|$|E
