40|$|We {{show that}} {{although}} forecasts of independent <b>analysts</b> are less accurate ex post, they yield forecast errors {{that are more}} strongly associated with abnormal stock returns. This suggests that forecasts of independent <b>analysts</b> are superior to those of nonindependent <b>analysts</b> in representing ex ante market expectations. We also show that forecasts of nonindependent <b>analysts</b> become more accurate and less biased, and produce forecast errors more strongly associated with abnormal stock returns when independent <b>analysts</b> are following the same firms than when they are not.

40|$|I provide {{evidence}} that geographically proximate <b>analysts</b> are more accurate than other <b>analysts.</b> Stock returns immediately surrounding forecast revisions suggest that local <b>analysts</b> impact prices more than other <b>analysts.</b> These effects are strongest for firms located in small cities and remote areas. Collectively {{these results suggest that}} geographically proximate <b>analysts</b> possess an information advantage over other <b>analysts,</b> and that this advantage translates into better performance. The well-documented underwriter affiliation bias in stock recommendations is concentrated among distant affiliated analysts; recommendations by local affiliated <b>analysts</b> are unbiased.

40|$|We {{show that}} <b>analysts</b> who display more {{consistent}} forecast errors {{have a greater}} effect on stock prices than <b>analysts</b> who provide more accurate but less consistent forecasts. This result leads to three implications. First, consistent <b>analysts</b> {{are less likely to}} be demoted to a less prestigious brokerage house and are more likely to be named All Star <b>analysts.</b> Second, <b>analysts</b> strategically "lowball" (that is, deliver downward-biased forecasts) to increase their consistency. This is because lowballing gives management an easier target to beat and, in turn, management grants <b>analysts</b> greater access to company information. Finally, the benefits of both consistency and lowballing increase while those of accuracy decrease when institutional/sophisticated investors are more of a presence in the <b>analyst’s</b> audience...|$|R

Analysis from a panel dataset of research <b>analysts</b> in investment banks over 1988 - 1996 reveals that star <b>analysts</b> are more likely than non-star <b>analysts</b> to become entrepreneurs. Furthermore, we find that ventures started by star <b>analysts</b> have a higher probability of survival than ventures established by non-star <b>analysts.</b> Extending traditional theories of entrepreneurship and labor mobility, our results also suggest that drivers of turnover vary by destination: turnover to entrepreneurship and other turnover.

40|$|This study {{examines}} recent regulatory and practitioner concerns that managers provide more (less) information to <b>analysts</b> with more (less) favorable stock recommendations. We examine the relative forecast accuracy of <b>analysts</b> {{before and after}} a recommendation issuance {{under the assumption that}} increases (decreases) in management-provided information will increase (decrease) analysts' relative forecast accuracy. We find that <b>analysts</b> issuing more favorable recommendations experience a greater increase in their relative forecast accuracy compared with <b>analysts</b> with less favorable recommendations. Additional tests on the change in frequency with which <b>analysts</b> issue forecasts independent of or in conjunction with other <b>analysts</b> after their recommendation change yield corroborating results. In addition, we find that the greater increase in relative accuracy for <b>analysts</b> with more favorable recommendations exists prior to the passage of Regulation FD but not after. The combined results are consistent with <b>analysts</b> receiving relatively more management-provided information following the issuance of more favorable recommendations.

40|$|This study {{examines}} whether investment banking ties influence {{the speed with}} which <b>analysts</b> convey unfavorable news. We hypothesize that affiliated <b>analysts</b> have incentives to respond promptly to good news but prefer not to issue bad news about client companies. Using duration models of the time between an equity issue and the first downgrade, we find affiliated <b>analysts</b> are slower to downgrade from Buy and Hold recommendations and significantly faster to upgrade from Hold recommendations, in both within-analyst and within-issuer tests. We also find affiliated <b>analysts</b> issue recommendations sooner and more frequently after an offering than unaffiliated <b>analysts,</b> and that unaffiliated <b>analysts</b> are more likely than affiliated <b>analysts</b> to drop coverage of sample firms. Our findings indicate that banking ties increase analysts' reluctance to reveal negative news, and that reform efforts must carefully consider the incentives of affiliated and unaffiliated <b>analysts</b> to initiate coverage and convey the results of their research.

40|$|We {{estimate}} {{the dynamics of}} recommendations by financial <b>analysts,</b> uncovering the determinants of inertia in their recommendations. We provide overwhelming evidence that <b>analysts</b> revise recommendations reluctantly, introducing frictions to avoid frequent revisions. More generally, we characterize the sources underlying the infrequent revisions that <b>analysts</b> make. Publicly available data matter far less for explaining recommendation dynamics than do the recommendation frictions and the long-lived information that <b>analysts</b> acquire but the econometrician does not observe. Estimates suggest that <b>analysts</b> structure recommendations strategically to generate a profitable order flow from retail traders. We provide extensive evidence that our model describes how investors believe <b>analysts</b> make recommendations, and that investors value private information revealed by analysts' recommendations. ...|$|R

40|$|This work investigates both {{theoretically}} and empirically how the behaviour {{of financial}} <b>analysts</b> {{is affected by}} competition, measured as the strength of coverage of a stock from other <b>analysts.</b> The interaction among <b>analysts</b> and investors is modelled as a dynamic cheap talk game. The theoretical model shows that <b>analysts</b> having {{a conflict of interest}} with investors, report information truthfully with higher probability if other, “neutral”, <b>analysts</b> report information on the same stock. This empirical prediction is tested on data about recommendations on IPOs. The main result is that <b>analysts</b> working for the lead underwriter of the IPO (“insiders”) are more optimistic when there are no other <b>analysts</b> (not working for the lead underwriter, “outsiders”) covering the stock. The data also show that insiders do not seem to use the information contained in outsiders recommendations. Finally, outsiders are not influenced by recommendations previously issued by insiders. These results also allow to discriminate between competing hypothesis brought forward to explain insider’s overoptimism. The empirical evidence suggests that insider <b>analysts</b> overoptimism is induced by incentives rather than by a “psychological bias”.

40|$|Why do {{security}} <b>analysts</b> issue overly positive recommendations? One {{explanation is}} that <b>analysts</b> pick their favorite stocks and are truly too optimistic. An alternative {{explanation is that}} <b>analysts</b> distort recommendations to maximize trade commissions and underwriting business, particularly if affiliated with an underwriter. We use a novel approach to assess {{the relative importance of}} both explanations, exploiting the concurrent issuance of recommendations and earnings forecasts. We first show that small traders follow recommendations but not forecast updates; large traders discount recommendations and follow forecasts. As a result, <b>analysts</b> with conflicting interests may distort recommendations upwards to trigger small-investor purchases and to please management, but may not distort forecasts. They may in fact distort forecasts downwards shortly before the announcement to allow management to beat the forecast. If <b>analysts</b> are, instead, truly too optimistic they should express their positive view both in recommendations and in forecasts. We find that affiliated <b>analysts</b> issue more optimistic recommendations but more pessimistic forecasts than unaffiliated <b>analysts.</b> Moreover, the affiliated <b>analysts</b> who have the most positive recommendations outstanding also give the most negative forecasts, consisten...|$|R
