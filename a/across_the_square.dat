25|$|At {{the same}} time General Ivan Novitskiy amassed {{more than half the}} Russian forces at the western end of Jerusalem Avenue. 4,000 men were {{withdrawn}} from there without a shot being fired. Among the units rallied there were forces that– according to the Russian plan– were to secure the entire southern part of Warsaw, including forces under Lieutenant-Colonel Kasztoliński and von Klugen, parts of Igelström's personal guard and the remnants of the force {{to take part in the}} battle against the 10th Regiment, commanded by Major Bago. Novitskiy, after several hours of wavering, organised a relief force of 3000 men and 10 cannons, and started a march towards the city centre. The column crossed Marszałkowska Street unopposed and reached Saxon Square. There it was met by a negligible unit of not more than 100 civilians armed with a single 6 pounder cannon, commanded by Captain of Artillery Jacek Drozdowski. The Polish unit opened fire from its cannon and started gradually retreating <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>square</b> towards the Brühl's Palace on its northern edge, firing all the way. At {{the same time}} the Russian commander did not issue any orders and his column simply stopped under fire. Although much inferior in numbers, training and equipment, Drozdowski's unit was not attacked by the Russian force, as Novitskiy lost control over his troops. The Russian soldiers broke ranks and entered the undefended Saxon Palace, where they seized the cellars full of alcohol. The Poles continued to shell them with artillery for almost three hours, without being attacked. When a company of the 10th Regiment returning from Powiśle appeared at Królewska Street, the Russians started a disorganised retreat towards Jerusalem Avenue, leaving Igelström to his fate.|$|E

Unlike modern Shetlands (but like some related breeds) this ram had four horns. He was kept with about 40 other sheep on President's Square in front of the White House. In the spring of 1808, it {{attacked}} several people who had taken shortcuts <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>square,</b> injuring some and actually killing a small boy. Having been moved to Jefferson's private estate at Monticello, the ram was eventually killed after having killed several other rams: it was described by Jefferson as [...] "this abominable animal".

2500|$|The {{first floor}} of the main branch of the Cedar Rapids Public Library was filled with floodwater. With a {{collection}} of books said to be about 290,000, the entire adult section was lost, as was the reference section. The children's collection, however, was located on the unflooded second floor. Plans to expand the building and to increase the library levy were shelved. On July 3, 2008, the library's director stated that the main branch may not reopen for at least three years, with the possibility open of moving to a new location altogether. In the meantime, the library leased additional space at Westdale Mall, where it already operated a branch. [...] FEMA would not pay for rebuilding the main branch on the current, flood-prone site, so a property swap was effected with a commercial property owner away from the river; the new owner paid for renovation, and FEMA paid for a new library <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>square</b> from the city art museum. In 2013, the downtown branch of the library was completed by OPN Architects, a regional design firm located in Cedar Rapids. The project has received many awards in library design and construction by the American Library Association and American Institute of Architects.|$|E

Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy said it would be a [...] "dramatic climax" [...] to the storyline. On being told who Kat's lover is, Richie said he understood and found it clever, though he had previously thought it would be Michael or Ray. Richie told Radio Times that Alfie is still in denial about the affair but becomes Kat's [...] "stalker", following her to the bedsit.
