5|$|Although English {{furniture}} derives so extensively {{from foreign}} and especially French and Italian models, the earlier forms of English chairs owed but little to exotic influences. This was especially the case {{down to the}} end of the Tudor period, after which France began to set her mark upon the British chair. The squat variety, with heavy and sombre back, carved like a piece of panelling, gave place to a taller, more slender, and more elegant form, in which the framework only was carved, and attempts were made at ornament in new directions. The stretcher especially offered opportunities which were not lost upon the cabinet-makers of the Restoration. From a mere uncompromising cross-bar intended to strengthen the construction it blossomed, almost suddenly, into an elaborate scroll-work or <b>an</b> <b>exceedingly</b> graceful semicircular ornament connecting all four legs, with a vase-shaped knob in the centre. The arms and legs of chairs of this period were scrolled, the splats of the back often showing a rich arrangement of spirals and scrolls. This most decorative of all types appears to have been popularized in England by the cavaliers who had been in exile with Charles II, and had become familiar with it in the north-western parts of the European continent. During the reign of William III and Mary II these charming forms degenerated into something much stiffer and more rectangular, with a solid, more or less fiddle-shaped splat and a cabriole leg with pad feet. The more ornamental examples had cane seats and ill-proportioned cane backs. From these forms was gradually developed the Chippendale chair, with its elaborately interlaced back, its graceful arms and square or cabriole legs, the latter terminating in the claw and ball or the pad foot. George Hepplewhite, Thomas Sheraton and Robert Adam all aimed at lightening the chair, which, even in the master hands of Thomas Chippendale, remained comparatively heavy. The endeavour succeeded, and the modern chair is everywhere comparatively slight.|$|E

5|$|IV. Allegro ma non troppo – Presto. The finale has {{the same}} {{structure}} {{as that of the}} previous sonata. Many elements of this movement imply large-scale resolution of harmonic and thematic conflicts established earlier in this and even the two previous sonatas. The main rondo theme opens with an 'empty' octave on G, which resolves to C minor, subsequently interpreted as ii of V in B-flat major. Brendel asserts that this theme, beginning in the ambiguous G/Cm, functions as a resolution of the troubling G trill presented in {{the very beginning of the}} sonata, using G to resolve to F major as V of B-flat. The second theme, in ternary form, is written in the traditional key of the dominant, with a central section in D major; it consists of an extended, characteristically Schubertian stepwise melody played over an uninterrupted flow of semiquavers. This second theme uses the same melodic contour (5-8-7-6-6-5-(5-4-4-3)) of the remarkable C major modulation in the final A section of the second movement, implying further connotations of conflict resolution. After an abrupt end to the second theme and a pregnant pause, a minor dotted-rhythm chordal theme in F-minor suddenly enters fortissimo, elaborating and modulating before sublimating into a pianissimo version of itself in the parallel major. This third theme is highly similar in rhythm and melodic contour as well as left hand pattern to the tarantella of the C minor sonata, which may not be a coincidence when considering the overall high level of cyclic connection between the sonatas. This theme evolves into a rhythmic segue that leads seamlessly back to the main theme of the rondo. The development section, based entirely on the rhythmic pattern of the main rondo theme, is characterised by juxtaposed eighth notes and triplets, reaching a climax on C-flat major, from which the bass descends in chromatic modulation eventually to G in an extended diminuendo to return to the main theme. In the coda, the main theme is fragmented in a manner also similar to the finale of the previous sonata; in a highly chromatic and unstable progression, the octave on G here descends through G-flat to F, in an extension of the G-G-F resolution of the theme. After finally reaching this dominant preparation for the final time, the movement closes with <b>an</b> <b>exceedingly</b> triumphant and affirming presto section that totally resolves all dramatic conflicts in the sonata and the series.|$|E

25|$|In 1991 David Deutsch {{showed that}} quantum theory is fully {{consistent}} (in {{the sense that}} the so-called density matrix can be made free of discontinuities) in spacetimes with closed timelike curves.

Accordingly, the destructive positive feedback loop of virtual particles circulating through a wormhole time machine, a result indicated by semi-classical calculations, is averted. A particle returning from the future does not return to its universe of origination but to a parallel universe.

25|$|Corey-Winter olefination is a stereospecific {{transformation}} of 1,2-diols to alkenes involving the diol substrate, thiocarbonyldiimidazole, and excess trialkylphosphite. The mechanism has been narrowed {{down to two}} possible pathways, but the exact mechanism is unknown.

Nonetheless, the reaction is stereospecific for most substrates unless the product would lead to <b>an</b> <b>exceedingly</b> strained structure. The formation of sterically hindered trans alkenes present in 7-membered rings was attempted by Corey and coworkers, but was unsuccessful even when employing this new synthetic methodology incurring enormous ring strain.
