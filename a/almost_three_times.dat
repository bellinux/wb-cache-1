5|$|Since the Norse sources (including the skaldic verses {{which were}} the sagas' main sources) chiefly {{describe}} war-related matters, less is known about other events during the reigns of the early Norwegian kings. Snorri, for instance, wrote fifteen pages about Magnus and only two pages about Magnus' peaceful father Olaf Kyrre (despite Olaf's reign lasting <b>almost</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> longer than Magnus'). Modern historians have noted that this probably has made the image of kings like Magnus Barefoot one-sided (in Magnus' case, skewed towards his deeds as a warrior).|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} George Luttrell {{inherited}} the castle in 1571, it was dilapidated, {{with the family}} preferring to live in their house, now known as Court House, at East Quantoxhead. In 1617 George employed the architect William Arnold, {{to create a new}} house in the Lower Ward of the castle. Arnold was an important architect in the south-west of England, and had managed the building of nearby Montacute and Cranborne House. The redesign expanded on some of the existing buildings and walls to create a 16th-century Jacobean mansion with a symmetrical front and square towers, set within the older castle walls and overlooked by the keep above. The building was decorated in the latest styles, including ornamental plaster ceilings. The project ran <b>almost</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> over budget, costing Luttrell more than £1,200.|$|E
5|$|Soviet {{investment}} in the defense sector was not driven by military necessity, but {{in large part by}} the interests of massive party and state bureaucracies dependent on the sector for their own power and privileges. The Soviet Armed Forces became the largest in {{the world in terms of}} the numbers and types of weapons they possessed, in the number of troops in their ranks, and in the sheer size of their military–industrial base. However, the quantitative advantages held by the Soviet military often concealed areas where the Eastern Bloc dramatically lagged behind the West. For example, the Persian Gulf War demonstrated how the armor, fire control systems and firing range of the Soviet's most common main battle tank, the T-72, were drastically inferior to the American M1 Abrams, yet the USSR fielded <b>almost</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> as many T-72's as the US deployed M1's.|$|E

5|$|The {{fact that}} it is a seaside city has shaped Póvoa de Varzim's economy: the fishing {{industry}}, from the fishing vessels that put in each day to the canning industry and to the city's fish market, beach agriculture, and seaweed-gathering for fertilizing fields are the result of its geography.

Nevertheless, the mean value of fish landed in 2004, in its seaport, was <b>almost</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> that of Matosinhos seaport and significantly higher in the average vessels' capacity. Its fishing productivity is also comparatively higher than the national average. A Poveira is a traditional Povoan canning factory and most of its production, 80 to 85%, is exported and deals with high-end brands in canned fish, for MDC markets. Export market brands include: Poveira, D'Henry IV, Ala-Arriba, Minerva, and Alva.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the award}} {{was created by}} The Bookseller, {{the idea of an}} award celebrating books with odd titles was {{proposed}} by Trevor Bounford of the Diagram Group in order to provide entertainment during the Frankfurt Book Fair in 1978. Originally known as the Diagram Group Prize for the Oddest Title at the Frankfurt Book Fair, any book that was at the fair could be nominated, but other books outside of the fair were also included. In 1982, Horace Bent, diarist for The Bookseller, took over administrative duties. Following two occasions in 1987 and 1991 when no prize was given {{due to a lack of}} odd titles, The Bookseller opened suggestions to the readers of the magazine. In 2000, the winner was voted for by the public instead of being decided by Bent. In 2009, online submissions sent on Twitter were accepted. This resulted in the highest number of submissions for the prize in its history, with 90 books being submitted (50 from Twitter), <b>almost</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> the number from the previous year (32). However, Bent also expressed his annoyance at people who gave submissions that broke the rules, with some of the books mentioned being published as far back as 1880. The 2014 prize allowed nominations from self-published works, the first book being Strangers Have the Best Candy by Margaret Meps Schulte, which won the prize.|$|E

40|$|The Australian {{accounting}} standard {{for research and}} development (R&D) effective from 1 January 2005 (AASB 138) contains more stringent requirements regarding the capitalisation of R&D spending than its predecessor (AASB 1011). The majority of R&D spending now has to be expensed immediately. This affects earnings significantly. Investment in R&D is critical in maintaining competitive advantage and increases a firm’s probability of survival. However, prior research found companies sacrifice long-term value to smooth earnings and that managers cut R&D spending in response to target-driven earnings pressures. Sacrificing long-term value and returns in pursuit of short-term returns is referred to as short-termism. It is possible that AASB 138 could have discouraged managers to invest in R&D activities and that they may have chosen to reduce R&D spending as a means to manage earnings and meet expected profits. This study investigated these issues using financial data of 31 Australian listed firms for financial years from 2001 to 2010. A regression model was used to ascertain if short-termism affected R&D spending. Research intensity ratios were also calculated to determine trends in R&D spending. The study found a marked increase in the significance of short-termism in explaining changes in R&D of companies that capitalised R&D in accordance with AASB 1011. Furthermore, the the median research intensity ratio of companies that capitalised R&D under AASB 1011 declined <b>almost</b> <b>three</b> <b>time</b> that of companies that expensed R&D after the introduction of AASB 138. The study’s findings suggest that AASB 138 could have been a catalyst to changes in managerial decisions in pursuit of short-termism that resulted in reduced R&D spending as a means to manage earnings...|$|R
5|$|By mid-1991, however, falling {{inflation}} {{had reduced}} WMATA's construction costs {{so much that}} the agency said it could build the two final Green Line stations in Prince George's County without asking Congress for additional money. WMATA also proposed spending money <b>almost</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> faster up-front to accelerate its construction schedule, a move which would be more than compensated for by savings in out-years. Prince George's County officials threatened to block all further Metrorail construction unless they received guarantees that the stations in their county would be built. Funding for the remaining seven Green Line stations in the District and Prince George's remained in doubt as of August 1991, with District officials saying that it made sense to build the Georgia Avenue – Petworth and Columbia Heights stations and Prince George's representatives demanding that the three stations in their county be completed. WMATA said that it had so little money it could not fund 16 critical small construction projects, among them security gates at the Navy Yard and Waterfront stations and parts for escalators at the seven new Green Line stations in D.C. and Prince George's County. The funding impasse was broken in November 1991 when local and state governments agreed to roughly triple their contribution to Metro's construction costs by 1994 to complete the entire system.|$|E
