It emphasizes the cooperation between state <b>actors</b> and non-state <b>actors.</b> Hong Kong and Guangdong have gradually become a cross-border region since China opened her door in late 1970 s, and cross-border problems have followed. This thesis chooses cross-border E-waste problem in Hong Kong and Guangdong as a case study to examine the governance in cross-border level {{to tackle the}} problem. It focuses on the interactive process and the network forming between the state <b>actors</b> and non-state <b>actors</b> across the border to tackle problem.

In the process, Hong Kong social <b>actors</b> and mainland social <b>actors</b> cooperate together, going beyond the border to take action and extending their influences across the border.
