5|$|Breton {{was the son}} of William le Breton, a royal justice. The elder Breton, who is {{sometimes}} styled William Brito in records, came from a family who often served as justices and other legal officials. Occasionally the younger Breton appears in the records as John Bretun or John Brito. He served as Sheriff of Herefordshire from 1254 to 1257, and then as constable and bailiff of Abergavenny around 1257. In October 1259 he was sent abroad on matters pertaining to King Henry III of England, and Henry's son, the future Edward I.

5|$|The monarchy of Barbados has {{its roots}} in the English monarchy, under the {{authority}} of which the island was claimed in 1625 and first colonized in 1627, and later the British monarchy.

The monarch is represented in the country by the Governor-General of Barbados, Sir Elliott Belgrave.|$|E

5|$|A {{civil war}} between Stephen and the Empress Matilda soon broke out and Gilbert took his chance to rise up against Stephen, seizing Ludlow Castle. Stephen responded by taking an army into the Welsh Marches, where he {{attempted}} to garner local support by marrying one of his knights, Joce de Dinan, to Sybil and granting the future ownership of the castle to them. Stephen took the castle after several attempts in 1139, famously rescuing his ally Prince Henry of Scotland when the latter was caught on a hook thrown over the walls by the garrison. Gilbert still maintained {{that he was the}} rightful owner of Ludlow, however, and a private war ensued between Joce and himself. Gilbert was ultimately successful and retook the castle around a few years {{before the end of the}} civil war in 1153. He ultimately left for the Levant, leaving Ludlow in the hands of firstly, his eldest son, Robert, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>after</b> Robert's death, his younger son, Hugh de Lacy.|$|E
5|$|Business Loop Interstate 75 (BL I-75) is a {{business}} loop running through West Branch that was originally numbered Business M-76 (Bus. M-76). It starts at exit212 south on I-75 south of West Branch. From that interchange, BL I-75 runs northward along Cooks Road in Horton and West Branch townships past an outlet mall. North of the mall, the roadway has two lanes, one in each direction plus an intermittent center turn lane, and it curves first to the northeast through a rural section of the townships, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>after</b> intersecting Old 76 Road, it turns northwesterly through a commercial area. On the eastern city limits, BL I-75 turns due west and runs concurrently with M-55 on the four-lane Houghton Avenue through downtown West Branch. On {{the western side of}} downtown, the business loop intersects the northern end of M-30 and narrows to two lanes. BL I-75/M-55 continues out of town, running past more businesses before meeting I-75 at exit 215. At that interchange, BL I-75 ends, and M-55 merges onto the freeway. On average each day in 2013, 10,682vehicles use the business loop near the southern I-75 interchange, and 15,399vehicles do so between the M-55 junction and 5th Street in downtown West Branch, the lowest and highest traffic counts.|$|E
5|$|Ebert spent a {{semester}} as a master's {{student in the}} department of English there before attending the University of Cape Town on a Rotary fellowship for a year. He returned from Cape Town to his graduate studies at Illinois for two more semesters <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>after</b> being accepted as a PhD candidate at the University of Chicago, he prepared to move to Chicago. He needed a job to support himself while he worked on his doctorate and so applied to the Chicago Daily News, hoping that, as he had already sold freelance pieces to the Daily News, including an article on the death of writer Brendan Behan, he would be hired by editor Herman Kogan. Instead Kogan referred Ebert to the city editor at the Chicago Sun-Times, Jim Hoge, who hired Ebert as a reporter and feature writer at the Sun-Times in 1966. He attended doctoral classes at the University of Chicago while working as a general reporter at the Sun-Times for a year. After movie critic Eleanor Keane left the Sun-Times in April 1967, editor Robert Zonka gave the job to Ebert. The load of graduate school and being a film critic proved too much, so Ebert left the University of Chicago to focus his energies on film criticism.|$|E

5|$|Hamence {{was not to}} play another {{first-class}} match until December 1945 {{after the}} end of the Second World War. During the war, he served for four years with the Royal Australian Air Force. Upon his return, he immediately hit form for South Australia against New South Wales where he hit 74 not out and 75 in a match starting 14 December 1945. He then scored 56 against Victoria on 18 January, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>after</b> three single figure scores he hit 76 against Queensland. He then experienced a drop in form, with only one significant score, 46 against Wellington, for seven innings. He ended the 194546 season with 332runs at 36.88. At the start of the 194647 season, however, he enjoyed his greatest success thus far, scoring consecutive centuries in three innings from 15 November 1946 until 19 December: 116 against Victoria and 132 and 101notout against New South Wales, the latter followed up by a score of 48 in the second innings. This was followed by a career-best 145 against the touring MCC team on 24 January 1947, and 63 against Queensland on 21 February. He ended the season with 675 runs at 56.25.|$|E
5|$|In 1270 Roger Bigod, the 5th Earl, {{inherited}} the castle and undertook extensive renovations there whilst living in considerable luxury and style. Although still extremely wealthy, the Bigods were now having to borrow increasing sums from first the Jewish community at Bungay <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>after</b> {{the expulsion of}} the Jews, Italian merchants; {{by the end of}} the century, Roger was heavily in debt to Edward I as well. As a result, Roger led the baronial opposition to Edward's request for additional taxes and support for his French wars. Edward responded by seizing Roger's lands and only releasing them on the condition that Roger granted them to the Crown after his death. Roger agreed and Framlingham Castle passed to the Crown on his death in 1306.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the next week, the US troops were able to discern the North Koreans' system of attack and use it to their advantage. The North Koreans used a system of flares to signal various actions and {{coordinate}} them. It quickly became apparent to the defending Americans that green flares were used to signal an attack on a given area. So the 27th Infantry obtained its own green flares <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>after</b> the North Korean attack had begun, fired them over its main defensive positions. This confused the attacking forces and often drew them to the points of greatest US strength where they suffered massive casualties from defensive machine-gun crossfire. The US troops also began using land mines in front of their positions to stall the North Koreans. The mines stopped the tanks and the infantry tried to remove them. When this happened, US troops fired flares to illuminate the scene and pre-registered artillery and mortar fire blasted the immobilized North Koreans. This tactic was effective in inflicting further significant casualties.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} slowed during 1296, although debts {{continued to}} build up, and work dropped off further the following year, stopping entirely by 1300, by when around £11,000 had been spent. The halt was primarily {{the result of}} Edward's new wars in Scotland, which had begun to consume his attention and financial resources, but it left the castle only partially complete: the inner walls and towers were {{only a fraction of}} their proper height and the north and north-west sides lacked outer defences altogether. In 1306 Edward became concerned about a possible Scottish invasion of North Wales, but the unfinished castle had already fallen into a poor state of repair. Work recommenced on completing the outer defences, first under James' direction <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>after</b> his death in 1309, Master Nicolas de Derneford. This work finally halted in 1330 with the castle still not built to its intended height; {{by the end of the}} project, £15,000 had been spent, a colossal sum for the period. A royal survey in 1343 suggested that at least a further £684 would be needed to complete the castle, but this was never invested.|$|E
5|$|To be {{considered}} for title, a person must perform a deed that greatly benefits the state and Belarusian society at large. The title can be awarded to those serving in the military, public service or private enterprise. It can only be awarded once to an individual, and can be awarded posthumously. The official criteria are stated in Chapter 2, Article 5 of Law N 288-З. Chapter 3, Article 60 of Law N 288-З allows any group (association) of workers to submit a recommendation (petition) for an individual to be awarded the title. Governmental bodies, the National Assembly, the Council of Ministers, cabinet officials and public unions, among others, are also eligible to submit nominations for the title. The candidate is evaluated, and if deemed worthy, the nomination is forwarded to the Council of Ministers <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>after</b> having been allowed by the Governmental Secretariat of the Belarusian Security Council, to the President of the Republic.|$|E
5|$|Converted to {{the jungle}} divisional {{establishment}} on their return to Australia, the battalions of the 9th Division were reorganised {{to prepare them for}} the rigours of jungle warfare. This saw their establishment drop to around 800 men, and the loss of much of their vehicles and heavy equipment. Following training on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland, the battalion was deployed to New Guinea where it took part in the Salamaua–Lae and Huon Peninsula campaigns in 1943–44. During this time, after concentrating at Milne Bay in August 1943, the 2/17th was involved in the first amphibious landing conducted by Australian soldiers since the landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, when it took part in the landing at Lae as part of Operation Postern on 4 September 1943. Lae fell more quickly than the Allied planners expected, and as a result, a quick follow-up operation was planned to secure the Huon Peninsula. On 22 September, the battalion landed at Scarlet Beach and, tasked with securing the beachhead and the flank, proceeded to move inland towards Sattelberg as part of efforts to capture Finschhafen. Finding their way blocked, the battalion later took part in significant actions around Jivevaneng and Kumawa, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>after</b> Sattelberg finally fell, the drive towards Sio. The battalion's casualties during this time amounted to 53 killed in action, 10 died of wounds, five died from accident, and 160 wounded in action.|$|E
