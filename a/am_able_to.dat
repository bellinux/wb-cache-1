Nor when I think of others whom I knew {{as a young man}} at both Universities, can I remember any instance of injury being done to the health which could fairly be set down to the exercise of rowing as then practised.

Legend of Mana featured the first vocal track of any Mana game, [...] "Song of Mana", which also serves as the game's opening theme. It was sung by Swedish vocalist Annika Ljungberg, who was chosen by Shimomura because she [...] "wanted to stay away from working with someone popular that everyone already knows". After hearing a sample of Ljungberg's music, she flew to Sweden [...] "straight away" [...] to do an analog recording of the song.|$|E
50|$|As {{children}} refine their motor skills, they <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> {{help themselves}} by completing daily activities independently. For example, {{children between the}} ages of 2 and 3 <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> put on and take off simplistic articles of clothing. They <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> manipulate clothing with zippers, use spoons, string together beads with large holes, and open doors with doorknobs. When children are between the ages of 3 and 4, they <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> manipulate clothing with larger buttons, use scissors to cut paper, and <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> copy simple lined shapes using a pencil. At 4 to 5 years of age, children <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> dress and undress themselves without assistance. They <b>are</b> also <b>able</b> <b>to</b> manipulate a fork, and have gained the dexterity to cut around shapes with a pair of scissors. And by age 6, a child <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> cut softer foods with a knife and <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> tie his or her own shoes.

500|$|Ville Valo is {{the main}} {{songwriter}} of HIM and his songs largely deal with themes of love. When talking about his songwriting, Valo stated: [...] "I didn't know {{how to cope with}} the world. Then I found an instrument, and through that I realized, that I <b>am</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> cope with the world and its evils, a bit better, through writing songs." [...] In terms of lyrical content, Valo has stated that [...] "I feel like there is no subject more important for a song than relationships. It's the only thing than touches me." [...] Valo also takes inspiration from literature, explaining that [...] "as a guy who writes songs, I get excited about an idea, or a book, or a sentence. I don't necessarily get excited about the whole of Tolkien, I just get excited about Uruk-hai. Just a little detail that just makes my mind work overdrive." [...] Valo and the rest of HIM have referred to their music as [...] "love metal", the idea of which was to combine more melodic and melancholic elements, with heavier influences, such as Black Sabbath and Type O Negative. Valo has described the music of HIM as [...] "sentimental, hard-hitting rock music".|$|E
500|$|Legend of Mana, {{released}} for the PlayStation in 1999, features music {{composed by}} Yoko Shimomura. She had previously composed for several Square games including Live A Live and Parasite Eve and had originally joined Square {{for the purpose}} of composing music for fantasy role-playing games. She was initially hesitant to compose for the Mana series, as she felt that it was so associated with the music of Ito and Kikuta. In 2002, Shimomura said that of all her compositions to date, she considered the soundtrack to Legend the one that best expresses herself. Shimomura claims that she prefers [...] "passionate music that comes from the heart", and that she has to [...] "feel the emotions of a piece in the extreme before I <b>am</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> write" [...] the music by putting herself in the same mood as the piece is supposed to be in.

Four of the game's tracks were released as part of , an arranged album highlighting the composer's work: [...] "Legend of MANA ~Title Theme~", [...] "Hometown Domina", [...] "Colored Earth", and [...] "Bejeweled City Ruined". Shimomura carefully chose the songs to be included on the album based on their apparent popularity among fans and how suitable they are for orchestra. In addition to the soundtrack album, a promotional album of music from Legend of Mana was produced and was included with preorders of the game in North America.|$|E

Karma scored 81 points less than the leading competitor, South Korea's Choi Mi-sun. On 8 August she competed in the Round of 64 and was drawn against Tuyana Dashidorzhieva of Russia, the fifth ranking athlete in the ranking round. Karma tied with Dashidorzhieva in the first set before the Russian outscored her by three points to secure the second set. Karma and Dashidorzieva tied with each other in the game's following two sets until the Russian won the final set to win the match. This meant Karma was eliminated from the competition.
