25|$|At one point, Orpheus married Eurydice, a nymph. While {{fleeing from}} {{an attack by}} Aristaeus, she stepped on a snake that bit her, killing her. To reclaim her, Orpheus entered the Underworld, where the music from his lyre charmed Hades. Hades relented and let Orpheus bring Eurydice back, on the {{condition}} that he never once look back until outside. Unfortunately, near the very end, Orpheus faltered <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back,</b> causing Eurydice to be left in the Underworld forever. Orpheus spent {{the rest of his life}} strumming his lyre while wandering aimlessly through the land, rejecting all marriage offers from women.|$|E
25|$|At his death, Wren was 90 (N.S.). Even {{the men he}} {{had trained}} and who owed much of their success to Wren's {{original}} and leadership were no longer young. Newer generations of architects were beginning to look past Wren's style. The Baroque school his apprentices had created was already under fire from a new generation that brushed Wren's reputation aside <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> beyond him to Inigo Jones. Architects of the 18th century could not forget Wren, {{but they could not}} forgive some elements in his work they deemed unconventional. The churches left the strongest mark on subsequent architecture. In France, where English architecture rarely made much impression, the influence of St Paul's Cathedral {{can be seen in the}} church of Sainte-Geneviève (now the Panthéon); begun in 1757, it rises to a drum and dome similar to St Paul's, and there are other versions inspired by Wren's dome, from St Isaac's (1840–42) in St Petersburg to the US Capitol at Washington, D.C. (1855–65).|$|E

They in turn, influenced British authors {{of the first half}} of the twentieth century such as G. K. Chesterton, who introduced further anti-German and anti-Protestant bias into the interpretation of George's reign. However, in the wake of World War II continental European archives were opened to historians of the later twentieth century and nationalistic anti-German feeling subsided. George's life and reign were re-explored by scholars such as Beattie and Hatton, and his character, abilities and motives re-assessed in a more generous light. John H. Plumb noted that: ...|$|E
