5|$|A {{company from}} the 2/28th Battalion {{captured}} Victoria shortly after coming ashore, and the battalion first met opposition at Flagstaff Hill at 10:45 <b>am.</b> <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battalion's companies subsequently captured the hill, while its other companies continued to advance. The 2/28th Battalion encountered increasing opposition {{as the day}} progressed, particularly {{to the west of}} its area of responsibility. During the afternoon of 10 June the battalion engaged Japanese troops in the area west of Flagstaff Hill (at the junction of Callaghan and MacArthur Roads), with the infantrymen being supported by tanks and mortars; the Australians counted 18 Japanese dead {{by the end of the}} day, and suffered several fatalities and men wounded in this fighting. After civilians reported that no Japanese were stationed on the Hamilton peninsula which formed the western side of Victoria Harbour, a troop from the 2/11th Commando Squadron was landed in the area during 10 June and secured it without opposition.|$|E

500|$|Band {{originally}} planned {{to produce a}} sequel called Laserblast II, with production work to begin in August 1986 and a theatrical release expected to follow shortly thereafter. A tagline released for the film read, [...] "The ultimate alien weapon is back." [...] When plans for the sequel were announced, Atlanta-based film critic Scott Journal wrote, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{few people in the}} world who saw the original and, believe me, it did not merit a followup." [...] However, Charles Band Productions fell into financial difficulties shortly after the production of Laserblast, and the project was eventually scrapped. However, the premise and elements of the abandoned sequel were later used in the 1988 Charles Band film, Deadly Weapon, which, like Laserblast, was about a bullied teenager who finds a powerful weapon and uses it to seek revenge against his enemies. Band continued to make films and eventually formed Empire Pictures.|$|E

2500|$|With the Down loop occupied, {{night shift}} {{signalman}} Meakin decided to shunt the local passenger train onto the Up main line.

[...] This meant that signalman Meakin had not yet telegraphed Kirkpatrick the [...] "train out of section" [...] signal for the empty coal train, and he could not send the [...] "blocking back" [...] signal to advise the Kirkpatrick signalman that the local train was standing on the Up main line. [...] Once the local train had crossed onto the Up main line, Meakin allowed the empty coal wagon train to proceed into the Up loop. [...] Arriving late aboard the local train, the early day shift signalman Tinsley reached Quintinshill signalbox shortly after 6.30 am.
