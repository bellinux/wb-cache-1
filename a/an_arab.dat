5|$|The British mandate in Palestine, where <b>an</b> <b>Arab</b> {{majority}} lived {{alongside a}} Jewish minority, presented the British {{with a similar}} problem to that of India.

Frustrated by the intractability of the problem, attacks by Jewish paramilitary organisations and the increasing cost of maintaining its military presence, Britain announced in 1947 that it would withdraw in 1948 and leave the matter to the United Nations to solve. The UN General Assembly subsequently voted for a plan to partition Palestine into a Jewish and <b>an</b> <b>Arab</b> state.|$|E

As part of Okello's carefully laid out plans, all over the island, gangs of Africans armed with knives, spears and pangas (machetes) went about systemically killing all the Arabs they could find.
