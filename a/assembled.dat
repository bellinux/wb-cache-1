5|$|At {{the time}} work stopped, Normandies hull was 65percent complete, her engines were 70percent complete, and her boilers were {{delivered}} but were instead installed in new destroyers. The turrets were 40percent <b>assembled.</b> Languedoc had 49percent of her hull and 73percent of her engines constructed; her boilers were 96percent complete and only 26percent of her turrets were built. The hulls of Flandre and Gascogne were 65 and 60percent complete, respectively, and their engines were 60 and 44percent <b>assembled.</b> Both of their sets of boilers {{were used for}} destroyers. The two ships' turrets were 51 and 75percent complete.

5|$|Development {{work on the}} CFM56 began before CFMI was {{formally}} created. While work proceeded smoothly, the international arrangement led to unique working conditions. For example, both companies had assembly lines, some engines were <b>assembled</b> and tested in the U.S. and others in France. Engines <b>assembled</b> in France were subject to the initially strict export agreement, which meant that GE's core {{was built in the}} U.S., then shipped to the SNECMA plant in France where it was placed in a locked room into which even the President of SNECMA was not allowed. The SNECMA components (the fore and aft sections of the engine) were brought into the room, GE employees mounted them to the core, and then the <b>assembled</b> engine was taken out to be finished.|$|E

At the same time, similar Class 88 diesel multiple units were ordered for the non-electrified Bergen- and Dovre Lines. The trains were built by Strømmens Værksted, Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk and Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri (NEBB). The diesel series was <b>assembled</b> by Strømmen, while Skabo <b>assembled</b> the electric version. NEBB delivered the motors for the units.|$|E
