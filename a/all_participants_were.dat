5|$|Linezolid was {{associated}} with significantly greater mortality than the comparator antibiotics. When data from <b>all</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> pooled, {{the study found that}} 21.5% of those given linezolid died, compared to 16% of those not receiving it. The difference was found to be due to the inferiority of linezolid in the treatment of Gram-negative infections alone or mixed Gram-negative/Gram-positive infections. In participants whose infection was due to Gram-positive bacteria alone, linezolid was as safe and effective as vancomycin. In light of these results, the FDA issued an alert reminding healthcare professionals that linezolid is not approved for the treatment of catheter-related infections or infections caused by Gram-negative organisms, and that more appropriate therapy should be instituted whenever a Gram-negative infection is confirmed or suspected.|$|E

25|$|After an {{extended}} period of litigation between the Greek government and a group of Zappas' relatives over Zappas' bequests, Konstantinos Zappas secured the execution of Zappas' will. The Greek government used Zappas' money to complete the Gymnasterion, a central gym, in 1878, and to continue the work on the Zappeion exhibition center, which had begun in 1873 and was frequently interrupted. The Zappeion officially opened on October 20, 1888. As in 1875, Fokianos took charge of the sporting events (but did so independently of the earlier Olympic Committee), which were postponed up till April 30, 1889. These Games were not co-ordinated by the Olympic Committee that organised the 1859, 1870, and 1875 Zappas Games, but by Fokianos alone. Thirty athletes competed in a variety of disciplines including discus, pole long leap (over a ditch), weightlifting, mast climbing, and rope climbing among others. <b>All</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> clad alike.|$|E

500|$|Jones, Pelham, Carvallo and Mirenberg {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} number preference on interpersonal attraction. In a lab study they showed US participants text profiles of people. The profiles came with a prominently displayed, seemingly arbitrary code that was explained as merely to help the researchers {{keep track of the}} profiles. One half of the participants were shown a code that matched their birthday (e.g. someone born on 8 September saw a partner profile with the code [...] "09-08"); the other half a non-matching code (e.g. [...] "03-23"). <b>All</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> shown exactly the same profile. They had to rate how much they thought they would like the person in the profile. The results showed that participants liked the profiles significantly more when the code matched their own birthday numbers. Relative to participants in the control condition, participants in the birthday-association condition could {{at the end of the}} test more accurately recall the code, but only 5 of 110 participants mentioned the matching code as a potential influence. Jones et al. concluded that people’s preferences for their own birthday numbers are potent enough to influence people’s attraction to other people. Pelham and Carvallo subsequently looked at interpersonal attraction using field data. They used statewide marriage records to conclude that people disproportionately marry people who share their birthday numbers. They also found that brides disproportionately chose their own birthday numbers and birth months as wedding dates.|$|E
2500|$|In this study, {{two groups}} of {{participants}} {{took part in a}} two night counterbalanced [...] study. [...] Two tasks were learned by all participants between 10:00-10:30pm. [...] The declarative task was a paired-associate word list of 40 German semantically related word pairs. [...] The non-declarative task was a mirror-tracing task. [...] At 11:00pm <b>all</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> put on a two-hour infusion of either physostigmine or a placebo. [...] Physostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor; it is a drug that inhibits the breakdown of the inhibitory neurotransmitter Acetylcholine, thereby allowing it to remain active longer in the synapses. [...] The sleep group was put to bed while the other group stayed awake. [...] Testing of both tasks took place at 2:45am, 30 minutes after the sleep group had been woken up; a sleep which had been rich in slow-wave sleep (SWS). [...] Results showed that the increased ACh negatively affected recall memory (declarative task), in the sleep condition compared to participants given the placebo. Specifically, recall after sleep for the placebo group showed an increase of 5.2 ± 0.8 words compared to an increase of only 2.1 ± 0.6 words when participants were given the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. [...] Conversely, neither speed nor accuracy declined in the non-declarative mirror task when participants were given physostigmine, and neither task performance was affected in the wake groups when physotigmine was administered. [...] This suggests that the purpose of ACh suppression during SWS allows for hippocampus –dependent [...] declarative memory consolidation; high levels of ACh during SWS blocks memory replay on a hippocampal level.|$|E

2500|$|The {{winner for}} 2003 was Turkey {{with the song}} [...] "Everyway That I Can" [...] sung by Sertab Erener, written by legendary Turkish rock guitarist Demir Demirkan and Erener herself. The song scored 167 points, {{narrowly}} beating Belgium into second place with a margin of 2 points and Russia into third place with a margin of 3 points. This was the first win for Turkey at the Eurovision Song Contest. Norway and Sweden rounded {{out of the top}} five, placing fourth and fifth respectively. The United Kingdom achieved their worst result to date, coming in last place (26th) and scoring no points from any of the twenty-six voting nations., however they avoided relegation due to being one of the [...] "Big Four" [...] countries at the time. [...] The 2003 contest was the last contest to take place on one evening. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) revealed that it would be adding a semi-final show to the competition in order to accommodate the growing number of interested countries wishing {{to take part in the}} contest. This was also the last contest in which a relegation system was used to determine which countries would participate in the following year's contest. The contest also marked the fifth time in the history of the competition where <b>all</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> participating for the first time; there were no returning artists that had already competed in the contest on a previous occasion.
