50|$|A similar idea, {{also known}} as a shock mount, is found in {{furniture}} design, introduced by Charles and Ray Eames. This provides some shock absorption and serves as <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>hinge,</b> allowing the seat back to pivot.|$|E
50|$|Tic Tacs {{were first}} {{produced}} in 1969. They are usually sold in small transparent plastic boxes with <b>a</b> flip-action <b>living</b> <b>hinge</b> lid. Originally, Tic Tacs were dyed specific colours for different flavours, although {{in many countries}} the transparent plastic boxes are coloured and the actual Tic Tacs are white.|$|R
50|$|Plastic <b>living</b> <b>hinges</b> are {{typically}} manufactured in an injection molding operation that creates all three parts {{at one time}} as a single piece, and if correctly designed and constructed, it can remain functional {{over the life of}} the part. Polyethylene and polypropylene are considered to be the best resins for <b>living</b> <b>hinges,</b> due to their excellent fatigue resistance.|$|R

5000|$|Eclipse mints are {{packaged}} in a recyclable steel box. The {{top of the}} box (narrow end) is attached with metal hinge (a true hinge, not <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>hinge</b> like many boxed mints). The top may be opened and pushed back on the hinge {{to gain access to}} the mints. On opening the box the tagline [...] "powerful fresh breath" [...] is revealed, printed on a raised metal plate on the inner surface of the lid.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>living</b> <b>hinge</b> {{is a thin}} {{flexible}} hinge (flexure bearing) made from the same material as the two rigid pieces it connects, rather than cloth, leather, or some other flexible substance. It is typically thinned or cut to allow the rigid pieces to bend {{along the line of}} the hinge. The minimal friction and very little wear in such a hinge makes it useful in the design of microelectromechanical systems, and the low cost and ease of manufacturing makes them quite common in disposable packaging.|$|E
25|$|As {{polypropylene}} is {{resistant to}} fatigue, most plastic <b>living</b> <b>hinges,</b> {{such as those}} on flip-top bottles, are made from this material. However, {{it is important to}} ensure that chain molecules are oriented across the hinge to maximise strength.|$|R
40|$|When {{performing}} {{minimally invasive}} interventions, surgeons use grippers to grip and manipulate tissue. These grippers generally {{rely on their}} toothed profile and require pinching of the tissue for sufficient grip, entailing a risk of tissue damage. An solution should be found for this risk of damage. An alternative could be to manipulate the tissue without pinching or even touching it. Contactless gripping exists in the industrial field by using the principle of Bernoulli. This study explores the possibility of applying Bernoulli gripping for tissue manipulation during minimally invasive surgery. A medical gripper using the principle of Bernoulli was developed. Increasing the air flow, the radius of the gripper face and the radius of the nozzle has {{a positive effect on}} the lifting force. In order to prevent tissue damage, different variants are tested that change the direction of the air flow. In an exploring experiment, a deflector was selected out of seven variants as best solution to prevent damage from the air flow. The Bernoulli gripper was made expandable and collapsible for insertion {{in the body of the}} patient with <b>a</b> system of <b>living</b> <b>hinges.</b> The effect of Venturi channels and the position of a membrane for an airtight surface on the lifting force were tested. The lifting force generated on the object during gripping was measured using a tensile-strength tester. Bernoulli’s theory was compared to the results of the experiments and a discrepancy was found between theory and results. This study shows that a Bernoulli gripper is feasible to lift flexible tissue. BMEBioMechanical EngineeringMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
50|$|In 2008, Tic Tac {{introduced}} Tic Tac Chill, {{which is}} {{slightly larger than}} ordinary Tic Tacs and comes in a dual-opening packaging, using the traditional <b>living</b> <b>hinge</b> or <b>a</b> sliding opening {{on the front of}} the case. These come in three flavours: Exotic Cherry, Berry Blast, and Paradise Mint. Tic Tac Chill mints are also sugar-free, the Exotic Cherry ones instead of being sweetened with xylitol.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{approach}} to fabricating complex 3 D shapes via physical deformation of simpler shapes. Our focus is on ob-jects composed {{of a set of}} planar beams and joints, where the joints are thin parts of the object which temporarily become <b>living</b> <b>hinges</b> when heated, close to a fixed angle defined by the local shape, and then become rigid when cooled. We call this class of objects Melta-bles. We present a novel algorithm that computes an optimal joint sequence which approximates a 3 D spline curve while satisfying fabrication constraints. This technique is used in an interactive Meltables design tool. We demonstrate a variety of Meltables, fab-ricated with both 3 D-printing and standard PVC piping. ...|$|R
50|$|Funnels {{are usually}} made of {{stainless}} steel, aluminium, glass, or plastic. The material used in its construction should be sturdy {{enough to withstand}} {{the weight of the}} substance being transferred, and it should not react with the substance. For this reason, stainless steel or glass are useful in transferring diesel, while plastic funnels are useful in the kitchen. Sometimes disposable paper funnels are used in cases where {{it would be difficult to}} adequately clean the funnel afterwards (for example, in adding motor oil to a car). Dropper funnels, also called dropping funnels or tap funnels, have a tap to allow the controlled release of a liquid. A flat funnel, made of polypropylene, utilizes <b>living</b> <b>hinges</b> and flexible walls to fold flat.|$|R
40|$|Living lab environments {{are often}} {{promoted}} {{as a way}} to engage private companies, citizens, researchers, and public organizations in mutually beneficial learning. Based on an in-depth case study of <b>a</b> four-year <b>living</b> lab collaboration in gerontechnology, we agree that successful <b>living</b> lab development <b>hinges</b> on learning between the parties, yet its emergence cannot be presumed or taken for granted. Diverse competences and interests of participating actors often make technology development projects complicated and volatile. The study describes two specific challenges faced in <b>a</b> <b>living</b> lab project: i) power issues between the actors and ii) end-user reluctance to participate in the development of new technology. Despite the hardships, we suggest that the living lab environment worked as a catalyst for learning between users and developers. Nevertheless, realizing the benefits of this learning may be more challenging than is usually expected. Learning for interaction is needed before effective learning in interaction is possible...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{extend the}} {{principles}} of the freedom and constraint topologies (FACT) synthesis approach such that designers can analyze and synthesize serial flexure elements—not to be confused with serial flexure systems. Unlike serial systems, serial ele-ments do not possess intermediate rigid bodies within their geometry and thus avoid the negative effects of unnecessary mass and underconstrained bodies that generate uncon-trolled vibrations. Furthermore, in comparison with other common parallel flexure ele-ments such as wire, blade, and <b>living</b> <b>hinge</b> flexures, serial elements can be used within flexure systems to achieve (i) a larger variety of kinematics, (ii) more dynamic and elasto-mechanic versatility, and (iii) greater ranges of motion. Here, we utilize {{the principles of}} FACT to intuitively guide designers in visualizing a multiplicity of serial flexure element geometries that can achieve any desired set of degrees of freedom (DOFs). Using this approach, designers can rapidly generate a host of new serial flexure elements for syn-thesizing advanced flexure systems. Thirty seven serial flexure elements are provided as examples, and three flexure systems that consist of some of these elements are synthesized as case studies. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4028727...|$|R
