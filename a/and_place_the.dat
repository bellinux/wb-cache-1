5|$|Khmer is {{a member}} of the Austroasiatic {{language}} family, the autochthonous family in an area that stretches from the Malay Peninsula through Southeast Asia to East India. Austroasiatic, which also includes Mon, Vietnamese and Munda, has been studied since 1856 and was first proposed as a language family in 1907. Despite the amount of research, there is still doubt about the internal relationship of the languages of Austroasiatic. Diffloth places Khmer in an eastern branch of the Mon-Khmer languages. In these classification schemes Khmer's closest genetic relatives are the Bahnaric and Pearic languages. More recent classifications doubt the validity of the Mon-Khmer sub-grouping <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>the</b> Khmer language as its own branch of Austroasiatic equidistant from the other 12 branches of the family.|$|E

5|$|Spacetimes are the arenas {{in which}} all {{physical}} events take place—an event is a point in spacetime specified by its time <b>and</b> <b>place.</b> <b>The</b> basic elements of spacetime are events. In any given spacetime, an event is a unique position at a unique time. Because events are spacetime points, in classical relativistic physics, the location of an elementary (point-like) particle {{at a particular time}} can be written as (x, y, z, t). A spacetime is the union of all events {{in the same way that}} a line is the union of all of its points, formally organized into a manifold.|$|E
5|$|The 1982 work-ins {{took place}} from 24 July to 1 August and 21 August to 29 August. The work planned {{included}} {{the completion of}} the brickwork {{at the top of the}} tower, installation of the Elm curb, a start on the construction of the new cap, installing machinery and making and fitting various doors and windows. The cap frame was constructed, incorporating two beams from the original cap frame that were fit to be reused. The cap frame was completed in autumn 1982. It had been constructed upside down and a mobile crane was used to turn it over <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>the</b> windshaft into position.|$|E
5|$|Various {{courtship}} behaviours {{have been}} observed among mecopterans, with males often emitting pheromones to attract mates. The male may provide an edible gift such as a dead insect or a brown salivary secretion to the female. Some boreids have hook-like wings which the male uses to pick up <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>the</b> female on his back while copulating. Male panorpids vibrate their wings or even stridulate while approaching a female.|$|E

5|$|Tarbosaurus and Alioramus shared several skull features, {{including}} a locking mechanism {{in the lower}} jaw between the dentary and angular bones, and both lacked the prong of the nasal bones which connected to the lacrimal bones in all other tyrannosaurids except adult Daspletosaurus. The two genera may be closely related, representing an Asian branch of the Tyrannosauridae. Some specimens of Tarbosaurus have a row of bumps on the nasal bones like those of Alioramus, although much lower. The long and low shape of the only known Alioramus remotus skull indicated that it was immature when it died and might even have been a juvenile Tarbosaurus, which {{lived in the same}} time <b>and</b> <b>place.</b> <b>The</b> more prominent nasal crests and much higher tooth count of Alioramus, however, suggested it was a separate taxon, even if it is known only from juvenile remains, confirmed by the discovery of A. altai. Specimens identified as immature Tarbosaurus have the same tooth count as adults.|$|E
5|$|The TARDIS materialises on a {{seemingly}} derelict spaceship drifting in space. The Doctor, Rose, and Mickey explore {{the ship and}} are puzzled to find an eighteenth-century French fireplace. When he looks through the fireplace, the Doctor sees a young girl and asks who she is. She replies that her name is Reinette and that she lives in Paris in 1727. The Doctor deduces that the fireplace is a time window, a device that allows direct access to another time <b>and</b> <b>place.</b> <b>The</b> Doctor steps through the time window and arrives in Reinette's bedroom {{only to find that}} months have passed there. He discovers a ticking humanoid wearing eighteenth century clothing and a jester's mask hiding under Reinette's bed. After it threatens him with a saw-like device that slides out of its arm, the Doctor tricks the creature into returning through the time window to the spacecraft, where he and his companions learn that it is actually an intricate clockwork android. The android teleports away, and the Doctor warns Mickey and Rose not to go looking for it. The Doctor returns to Reinette's bedroom while Mickey and Rose arm themselves and go looking for the android. While trying to find Rose and Mickey, the Doctor discovers a horse that stepped through a time window, who he later names Arthur. Returning to Reinette's bedroom, the Doctor discovers that she is now a young woman. She flirts with the Doctor and they kiss, before she leaves to join her mother. The Doctor then realises that she is Madame de Pompadour, the mistress of King Louis XV.|$|E
5|$|A {{more recent}} {{preparation}} method pioneered by the Royal Ontario Museum removes all bones {{for a complete}} skeleton while also producing a round skin without bill or legs (called a ROM, though if one set of wing and leg bones remain with the skin the preparation is called a shmoo in North America). Alternatively, the entire bird (or any soft parts associated with preparations described above) may be preserved in alcohol. For any of these methods, several supplemental preparations may be made. For example, a wing may be removed and preserved separately as a spread wing for better study of flight feathers; a tissue sample may be removed and frozen for molecular analyses; or a recording of the bird's song before collection may be archived. Neither molecular samples nor sound recordings require a bird to be collected (killed). Finally, if the bird is too rotten for the skin and feathers to be preserved, {{as is the case}} with some salvaged specimens, the skeleton alone may be preserved. Dried tissue is removed from skeletons by using dermestid beetle larvae (genus Dermestes). Whereas in the past arsenic was routinely added to skins to protect them from destruction by insects, specimens prepared today are generally protected by an initial freezing period to kill insects and their eggs followed by keeping them in high-quality museum cases in a climate-controlled room. Each specimen has data associated with it, and the amount of data available is usually directly correlated with the specimen’s scientific value. Most specimens are of little value for research without accompanying information, such as the time <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>the</b> bird was found or collected. This and other important information, such as mass, sex, fat deposition, and degree of skull ossification, is written on a label along with a unique field and museum number. Modern computerized museum databases include all of this information for each specimen, as well as the types of methods used to prepare the bird. Modern collections seek to maximize the utility of each preserved individual, and this includes recording detailed information about it. Most modern specimens also include a tissue sample preserved for genetic study. Online access to collections’ data is becoming increasingly available, and a cross-institutional database covering millions of computerized bird records is in development.|$|E
