5|$|Despite being quadrupedal the {{ring-tailed lemur}} can rear up and balance {{on its hind}} legs, usually for {{aggressive}} displays. When threatened the ring-tailed lemur may jump {{in the air and}} strike out with its short nails and sharp upper canine teeth in a behaviour termed jump fighting. This is extremely rare outside of the breeding season when tensions are high and competition for mates is intense. Other aggressive behaviours include a threat-stare, used to intimidate or start <b>a</b> <b>fight,</b> <b>and</b> a submissive gesture known as pulled-back lips.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>a</b> <b>fight</b> <b>and</b> a stagecoach chase, Crane {{eventually}} thwarts Lady Van Tassel {{by throwing}} the skull to the Horseman, who reattaches {{his head to}} his body and breaks Lady Van Tassel's curse. The Horseman, no longer under her control, hoists Van Tassel up on his horse and gives her a bloody kiss against her will. He then rides to Hell, taking her with a smile, fulfilling her end of the deal with the Devil. Crane returns home to New York City with Katrina and Young Masbath, {{just in time for}} the new century.|$|E

Virgil carried the cane {{in his right hand}} and shifted the pistol in his waistband from the right side to his left. Holliday concealed the short shotgun under his long jacket.

He retired in 2000, having never played a game above Class AA. Taylor was the second of two players to be picked first overall in the MLB draft to never reach the major leagues, the other one being Steve Chilcott.|$|E
5|$|Following the Battle of San Domingo, Rear-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane, newly knighted, {{gathered}} a small squadron {{in anticipation of}} the arrival of the second French force under Willaumez. Based at Carlisle Bay, Barbados, Cochrane's forces patrolled the Leeward Islands for the French force during the spring, eventually locating Willaumez's ships at Fort-de-France on Martinique on 14 June 1806. An attempt to blockade the port ended in failure as several ships were damaged in high winds, but when Willaumez sailed on 1 July, Cochrane had planned ahead, and brought his squadron to Tortola, blocking the passage through which Willaumez would have to sail to attack the valuable Jamaica convoy, then gathering off Saint Thomas. With his squadron, Cochrane successfully drove off Willaumez on 4 July without <b>a</b> <b>fight,</b> <b>and</b> the French admiral retired to the Bahama Banks to await the convoy's passage northwards. Cochrane spent the next month preparing the convoy for its voyage, which it began during August while Willaumez was out of position to the north.|$|E

5|$|Grandmaster Flash {{suggests}} that Herc {{may not have}} kept pace with developments in techniques of cueing (lining up a record to play at a certain place on it). Developments changed techniques of cutting (switching from one record to another) and scratching (moving the record by hand to and fro under the stylus for percussive effect) in the late 1970s. Herc said he retreated from the scene after being stabbed at the Executive Playhouse while trying to intercede in <b>a</b> <b>fight,</b> <b>and</b> the burning down {{of one of his}} venues. In 1980, Herc had stopped DJing and was working in a record shop in South Bronx.|$|E
5|$|In October, Edmund {{was once}} more {{employed}} {{in a move}} against Badlesmere, when he {{took part in a}} siege on Leeds Castle in Kent, which was held by Badlesmere. After Badlesmere was forced to surrender, hostilities moved to the Welsh Marches, where Roger Mortimer and others were in open revolt. Once confronted with the royal army, Mortimer surrendered without <b>a</b> <b>fight,</b> <b>and</b> attention turned to the leader of the baronial opposition, Thomas of Lancaster. Edmund, who had taken part in the Marcher campaign, was now ordered, with the Earl of Surrey, to take Lancaster's castle of Pontefract. On 17 March 1322, Lancaster was captured after his defeat at the Battle of Boroughbridge, and brought to Pontefract. Here, Edmund was on the jury that condemned him to death for treason.|$|E
5|$|King William, {{using the}} {{treatment}} of Bishop John as a cause for war with Harald, brought a large army north in 12011202.

During this time, Earl Harald's son Thorfinn was captured by the Scots. Whether in revenge for {{the treatment of}} Bishop John, or to cow Harald, or because Thorfinn may have had some claim to the throne through his mother (the lady of Moray), he was blinded and castrated, dying soon later in prison.|$|E

5|$|On 8 July 1644, the Earl of Essex sent a Parliamentarian force, led by Colonel Sir Robert Pye with Lieutenant Colonel Robert Blake as {{his second}} in command, to reclaim Taunton. They took the town without <b>a</b> <b>fight,</b> <b>and</b> {{surrounded}} the castle. The Royalist forces under Major William Reeve that were garrisoned at Taunton Castle surrendered and retreated to Bridgwater. Pye left Taunton {{shortly after the}} capture, leaving Blake to hold the town. Blake had an army of about 1,000 men, and was charged with trying to blockade the roads to support the Earl of Essex's campaign in Devon and Cornwall.|$|E
5|$|On February 2, 2010, Phaneuf {{made his}} Toronto Maple Leaf debut, leading all Maple Leafs players in time on ice and ended {{the night with}} <b>a</b> <b>fight</b> <b>and</b> given second star of the game honours. He would record his first point, an assist, four nights later {{in a game against}} the Ottawa Senators and scored his first goal as a Leaf on April 7, 2010, on Henrik Lundqvist of the New York Rangers. Phaneuf was named an {{alternate}} captain in Toronto nine games after being acquired after Mike Komisarek suffered a season-ending injury. While Phaneuf struggled offensively to begin his tenure in Toronto – he played 25 games in Toronto before scoring his first goal – then-Leafs Head Coach Ron Wilson credited him with creating a positive change in the mood in the Toronto dressing room.|$|E
5|$|Revolt also flared in {{neighbouring}} Kent. Sir Simon de Burley, a close {{associate of}} both Edward III {{and the young}} Richard, had claimed that a man in Kent, called Robert Belling, was an escaped serf {{from one of his}} estates. Burley sent two sergeants to Gravesend, where Belling was living, to reclaim him. Gravesend's local bailiffs and Belling tried to negotiate a solution under which Burley would accept a sum of money in return for dropping his case, but this failed and Belling was taken away to be imprisoned at Rochester Castle. A furious group of local people gathered at Dartford, possibly on 5 June, to discuss the matter. From there the rebels travelled to Maidstone, where they stormed the gaol, and then onto Rochester on 6 June. Faced by the angry crowds, the constable in charge of Rochester Castle surrendered it without <b>a</b> <b>fight</b> <b>and</b> Belling was freed.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} Treaty of Kraków of 1525, Albrecht (Albert) of Hohenzollern planned a Polish–Lithuanian fief in Livonia, seeking a {{dominant}} position {{for his brother}} Wilhelm, the Archbishop of Riga. What happened instead was {{the establishment of a}} Livonian pro-Polish–Lithuanian party or faction. Internal fighting in Livonia took place when the Grand Master of the Brothers concluded a treaty with Moscow in 1554, declaring his state's neutrality regarding the Russian–Lithuanian conflict. Supported by Albrecht and the magnates, Sigismund II declared a war on the Order. Grand Master Wilhelm von Fürstenberg accepted the Polish–Lithuanian conditions without <b>a</b> <b>fight,</b> <b>and</b> according to the 1557 Treaty of Pozvol, a military alliance obliged the Livonian state to support Lithuania against Moscow.|$|E
5|$|The 2/1st Infantry Battalion {{began its}} advance on {{schedule}} at 0900, but the lead platoon came under {{heavy machine gun}} fire from Post 54, and Italian artillery knocked out the supporting mortars. The 3rd Regiment Royal Horse Artillery engaged the Italian guns and the platoon withdrew. Colonel Eather then organised a formal attack on Post 54 for 1330, following a bombardment of the post by artillery and mortars. The Italian guns were silenced when an Australian shell detonated a nearby ammunition dump. The Australians then captured the post. About {{a third of its}} defenders had been killed in the fighting. The remaining 66 surrendered. This prompted a general collapse of the Italian position in the north. Posts 56 and 61 surrendered without <b>a</b> <b>fight</b> <b>and</b> white flags were raised over Posts 58, 60, 63 and 65, and the gun positions near Post 58. By nightfall, Eather's men had advanced as far as Post 69 and only the fourteen northernmost posts still held out in the Gerfan sector.|$|E
5|$|Veronica and Tim {{investigate}} Hank’s alibi further, and it checks out, {{leading to}} his release. Veronica and Tim find secret phone recordings kept by Hank.

While listening to the phone calls, Veronica notices Mindy and Hank talking about a place named “Papa’s cabin”. They investigate the most recent phone calls made by Hank, and find that his alibi was faked—he was helping the witness’s son escape foster care. Keith comes {{up with the idea}} that Papa’s cabin {{has something to do with}} Ernest Hemingway. Keith visits the cabin, a retreat in Central America, before boarding the motorboat.

5|$|For an {{hour the}} {{officers}} drank, Malcolm and Cooke learning {{detailed information about}} the state of the defences and squadron in the Philippines, until a second boat pulled alongside Fox containing more officers keen to greet the French arrivals. This vessel was the personal barge of the Spanish commander at Cavite, Rear-Admiral Don Ignacio María de Álava, who was not aboard, but who sent a message via an aide in a third boat. Each time, the officers were escorted below to join the festivities whereupon their crews were seized at gunpoint and taken below decks as prisoners of war. In Malcolm's cabin, the captured officers were informed of their situation, promised release before the British frigates sailed, and offered more wine. The crew of Fox meanwhile forced the captured Spanish sailors to strip and donned their clothing. Climbing into the Spanish boats this party rowed for the mouth of the nearby Pasig River, where they had learned that three heavy gunboats were moored. Taking the crews by surprise, the British boarding parties drove off the Spanish without <b>a</b> <b>fight</b> <b>and</b> brought all three boats alongside Fox. These vessels normally carried crews of thirty and were well-armed, one with a 32-pounder long gun and two with 24-pounder long guns, each supplemented by four swivel guns.|$|E
5|$|Later on {{the evening}} of 7 August, she asked Bamber whether he had done it. He said no, but that a friend of his had, whom he named; the man was a plumber the family had used in the past. Bamber {{allegedly}} said he had told this friend how he could enter and leave the farmhouse undetected, and that one of his instructions had been for the friend to telephone him from the farm on one of the phones in the house that had a memory redial facility, so that if the police checked it, it would give him an alibi. Everything had gone as planned, he said, except that Nevill had put up <b>a</b> <b>fight,</b> <b>and</b> the friend had become angry and shot him seven times. The friend had allegedly told Sheila to lie down and shoot herself last, Bamber said. The friend then placed the Bible on her chest so she appeared to have killed herself in a religious frenzy. The children were shot in their sleep, he said. Mugford said Bamber claimed to have paid the friend £2,000.|$|E
5|$|On 24 October, after a ten-day {{passage from}} Naples, Nelson joined the {{blockade}} squadron in HMS Vanguard accompanied by HMS Minotaur. On 28 October, Ball successfully completed {{negotiations with the}} French garrison on the small island of Gozo, the 217 French soldiers there agreeing to surrender without <b>a</b> <b>fight</b> <b>and</b> transferring the island, its fortifications, 24 cannon, a large quantity of ammunition and 3,200 sacks of flour to the British. Although the island was formally claimed by King Ferdinand of Naples, it was administered by British and Maltese representatives, whose first action was to distribute the captured food supplies to the island's 16,000 inhabitants. Malta and the surrounding islands were not self-sufficient and quickly the challenge of feeding the population became a strain on the islands' resources, particularly with so many men under arms, Although now formally {{in command of the}} islands, King Ferdinand refused to assist with supplies, and the responsibility was left to Ball and his captains to arrange for the transport of supplies from Italy. By the end of the year, the number of Maltese troops in the field had fallen from 10,000 to 1,500, supported by 500 British and Portuguese marines from the blockade squadron. The blockade fleet, consisting of five British and four Portuguese ships, operated from St. Paul's Bay and Marsa Sirocco (now Marsaxlokk) on the island of Malta itself.|$|E
