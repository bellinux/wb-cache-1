5|$|Rescued by Rover {{is often}} {{considered}} to be the United Kingdom's first major fiction film. Some four hundred prints were sold at a price of £8 each, and they circulated for at least four or five years. The character of Rover the dog, played by Hepworth's family dog Blair, became a household name and is considered the world's first canine film star. This first appearance of <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>in</b> a narrative based film caused the uncommon name of Rover to become popular for dogs.|$|E
5|$|The Saluki was {{historically}} bred in the Fertile Crescent where agriculture originated. Images {{of running}} dogs with long, narrow bodies adorn pottery found in Susa {{that dates back}} to 6,000 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia, with one writer suggesting that these might depict the ancestor of the Saluki, despite the depictions bearing erect, pointed ears. Salukis and Greyhounds were increasingly depicted on Egyptian tombs from the Middle Kingdom (2134 BC–1785 BC) onward, however it was during the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt that Salukis rose to prominence, replacing the Tesem (thought to be similar to modern Pariah dogs or a generic term for <b>a</b> <b>dog)</b> <b>in</b> ancient Egyptian art. The breed spread southward into the Sudan.|$|E

500|$|Dogmeat was {{inspired}} by the unnamed dog of Max Rockatansky (Mad Max) from the 1981 post-apocalyptic film Mad Max 2. His initial name had been [...] "Dogshit" [...] and his ultimate name was derived from the opening scene of the 1975 post-apocalyptic film A Boy and His Dog, in which the main character Vic calls his dog Blood [...] "dog meat". According to Fallout producer, lead programmer and designer Tim Cain, [...] "Leonard Boyarsky, the [...] art director ... had that movie running continuously in his office, and I think he remarked on several occasions that having <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>in</b> the game would be really cool. [...] why we wanted <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>in</b> the first place." [...] Fallout programmer and designer Jesse Heinig was credited by Cain as probably [...] "one person to thank for Dogmeat." [...] Heinig himself said: [...] "My understanding is that [...] Scott Bennie settled on the name 'Dogmeat' for the character, and it's likely that he did pick that from the story in question." ...|$|E

[...] Stine was excited about the book as it gave him the chance to write for teenagers again. Stine did research to follow existing vampire lore but admitted to adding [...] "good vampires" [...] who would restore victims.|$|E

[...] Meeker was impressed by the way Jim drove James' chickens out of the area where the family grew berries, by moving slowly. [...] Five dollars to one of James' children secured the purchase.

500|$|Stanley was a {{powerful}} orator who used dramatic flourishes to emphasize his points. He would often loosen his tie before he ever started speaking, {{and by the end}} of his speech have thrown off his vest and coat. In one instance, the candidates debated a tax on dog owners of one dollar per dog. Stanley favored the tax, while Morrow contended that everyone should be allowed one dog tax-free. Stanley ridiculed the idea as [...] "Free Old Dog Ring," [...] and sometimes howled like <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>in</b> speeches deriding the proposal. On another occasion Stanley, who had too much to drink, vomited in front of the audience as Morrow spoke. When Stanley took the podium, he remarked, [...] "That just goes to show you what I have been saying all over Kentucky. Ed Morrow plain makes me sick to my stomach." ...|$|E
500|$|Three endings are available.

Dialogue follows to reveal that the protagonist of the first game, Harry Mason, and his wife find and adopt the baby, naming her Cheryl, while Dahlia and Kaufmann plan to cast a spell to draw the other half of Alessa's soul back to the town, setting the events of the first Silent Hill game in motion. In the [...] "Bad" [...] ending, Travis awakens strapped to a gurney and is injected with an unknown substance: he starts convulsing and has a series of visions in which he kills two people and his form is briefly replaced by that of the Butcher. The joke ending sees Travis leave with a grey alien and <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>in</b> an unidentified flying object.|$|E
500|$|In a 1992 {{interview}} about Shiloh, Naylor said: [...] "Like a patchwork quilt, a novel {{is made up}} of things that have happened to me and things I have heard or read about, all mixed up with imaginings." [...] Naylor's characters are frequently based on herself and her two sons. She penned the novel following an excursion with her husband, Rex, to visit their friends, Frank and Trudy Madden, in West Virginia. Naylor and Rex were strolling along a river when they discovered <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>in</b> the grass following them. Dejected and frightened, the dog was [...] "the saddest, most mistreated-looking beagle I'd ever seen", Naylor later said. Because the dog frequently shuddered and slunk forward on her belly, Naylor suspected she had been abused. On a whim, Naylor whistled and the dog rushed forward, lapping Naylor's face. Tailing them until they reached the Maddens' house, the beagle remained under a tree, her paws cushioning her head during the drizzly afternoon. Naylor cried during her and her husband's trip home that night.|$|E

500|$|By August 20, Vick and {{the other}} three co-defendants agreed to {{separate}} plea bargains for the federal charges. They were expected to each receive federal prison sentences of between one and five years. Four days later, Vick filed plea documents with the federal court. He pleaded guilty to [...] "Conspiracy to Travel in Interstate Commerce in Aid of Unlawful Activities and to Sponsor <b>a</b> <b>Dog</b> <b>in</b> an Animal Fighting Venture". Vick admitted to providing most of the financing for the operation, and to participating directly in several dog fights in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina and South Carolina. He admitted to sharing in the proceeds from these dog fights. He further admitted that he knew his colleagues killed several dogs who did not perform well. He admitted to being involved in the destruction of 6–8 dogs, by hanging or drowning. The [...] "victimization and killing of pit bulls" [...] was considered an aggravating circumstance, allowing prosecutors to exceed the federal sentencing guidelines for the charge. Vick denied placing any side bets on the dogfights. On August 27, U.S. District Judge Henry E. Hudson accepted Vick's guilty plea, but reminded Vick that he (Hudson) was under no obligation to accept the prosecution's recommendation of a reduced sentence.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Waters {{publicly}} insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing {{he had left the}} band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him. He then went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd [...] "a spent force creatively." [...] When his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name. Gilmour responded by issuing a carefully worded press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist. He later told The Sunday Times: [...] "Roger is <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>in</b> the manger and I'm going to fight him". In 2013, Waters stated that he regretted the lawsuit, saying: [...] "I was wrong. Of course I was." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{tranquil}} setting {{offered by}} Astoria, the sessions were often {{interrupted by the}} escalating row between Waters and Pink Floyd over who had {{the rights to the}} Pink Floyd name. [...] O'Rourke, believing that his contract with Waters had been terminated illegally, sued the bassist for £25,000 of back-commission. [...] In a late-1986 board meeting of Pink Floyd Music Ltd (since 1973, Pink Floyd's clearing house for all financial transactions), Waters learnt that a bank account had been opened to deal exclusively with all monies related to [...] "the new Pink Floyd project". [...] He immediately applied to the High Court to prevent the Pink Floyd name from ever being used again, but his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed. [...] Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to gain a veto over further use of the band's name. [...] Gilmour's team responded by issuing a non-confrontational press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist; however, the guitarist later told a Sunday Times reporter: [...] "Roger is <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>in</b> the manger and I'm going to fight him, no one else has claimed Pink Floyd was entirely them. Anybody who does is extremely arrogant." [...] Waters twice visited Astoria, and with his wife had a meeting in August 1986 with Ezrin (the producer later suggested that he was being [...] "checked out"). [...] As Waters was still a shareholder and director of Pink Floyd music, he was able to block any decisions made by his former bandmates. [...] Recording moved to Mayfair Studios in February 1987, and from February to March – under the terms of an agreement with Ezrin to record close to his home – to A Studios in Los Angeles: [...] "It was fantastic because...the lawyers couldn't call in the middle of recording unless they were calling {{in the middle of the}} night." [...] The bitterness of the row between Waters and Pink Floyd was covered in a November 1987 issue of Rolling Stone, which became the magazine's best-selling issue of that year. [...] The legal disputes were resolved by the end of 1987.|$|E
