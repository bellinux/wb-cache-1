The teams {{exchanged}} power plays before Lutchenko scored a power play goal on <b>a</b> <b>slap</b> shot to put the Soviets ahead 2–1. Brad Park then scored his only goal of the series at even strength to complete some pretty passing between Dennis Hull and the Rangers' teammates of Ratelle, Gilbert and Park to tie the score.

After she leaves, Robert tells Eddard that he cannot rule the kingdoms if the Lannisters and Starks are at war and insists that Eddard remain the Hand of the King, or else Robert will give the position to Jaime. Robert also informs Eddard {{that he will be}} regent while Robert is away on a hunting trip.|$|E
5|$|Orr {{joined the}} Bruins for the 1966–67 season, his {{first as a}} professional. The Bruins were not {{convinced}} Orr belonged on defence, trying him out at centre first. Through the pre-season, Orr was given jersey number 27. At the season's start, the Bruins offered him jersey number 5, that of past Bruins star Dit Clapper, but Orr chose jersey number 4. Orr made his NHL regular-season debut on October 19, 1966, against the Detroit Red Wings, getting one assist. On October 22, he scored his first NHL goal against the Montreal Canadiens. It was <b>a</b> <b>slap</b> shot past Gump Worsley and the Boston Garden crowd gave Orr a standing ovation.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{a number}} of {{activities}} were proposed to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. A plan to hold a reenactment of the battle itself (as well as a reenactment of the subsequent French victory of 1760 at the Battle of Sainte-Foy) was cancelled due to threats of public disorder. Leaders of separatist parties described the event as <b>a</b> <b>slap</b> in the face for Quebecers of French ancestry and as an insult for the francophone majority. Some sovereigntist groups threatened or made indirect threats by stating that if the event took place, there could be violence. The movement against re-enactment and these threats of violence led the National Battlefields Commission to cancel the event.|$|E

Early in 2013, the Phillies promoted him to the major league club, and he made 18 starts with the Phillies before inflaming his rotator cuff, for which the Phillies precautionarily did not use him {{for the remainder of the}} season. He began the 2014 season competing for a spot in the back of the Phillies starting rotation, and he did make two starts, but was ineffective, and was sent back to the minor leagues, where he sustained <b>a</b> <b>SLAP</b> tear, and was placed on the disabled list.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} off-season, Edler {{was signed}} to an entry-level contract by the Canucks on 24 July 2006. Reporting to the Canucks' {{training camp in}} September 2006, his play had the Canucks slotting him in as the team's seventh defenseman. However, a hip injury saw him assigned to the Manitoba Moose. Following an injury to Canucks defenseman Sami Salo, he was called up to the NHL on 3 November 2006, two games into his AHL season. He made his NHL debut the following day against the Colorado Avalanche. Eleven days later, however, he was reassigned to the Moose, only to be recalled on 24 November. He scored his first NHL goal on 30 November, <b>a</b> <b>slap</b> shot that beat Anaheim Ducks goaltender Jean-Sébastien Giguère in a 2–1 loss. Edler was reassigned between Manitoba and Vancouver on several more occasions {{over the course of}} the 2006–07 season. He appeared in 22 games total for the Canucks, recording a goal and two assists. With the Moose, he scored five goals and 26 points over 49 games and was named Manitoba's Rookie of the Year.|$|E

25|$|The term bitch slap {{is derived}} from American slang. In the {{original}} sense, <b>a</b> bitch <b>slap</b> is <b>a</b> powerful, full-swing <b>slap</b> {{in the face with}} the front of the hand, evoking the way an angry pimp might <b>slap</b> <b>a</b> defiant prostitute (not to be confused with <b>a</b> pimp <b>slap</b> which uses the back of the hand). However, the term is now frequently used figuratively to describe a humiliating defeat or punishment.|$|R

25|$|The {{difference}} in {{pitch of the}} sounds arises because the different striking techniques selectively emphasize specific vibrational modes of the drum head. A tone emphasizes the (0,1) mode while suppressing the bass (Helmholtz resonance) and higher-order modes as much as possible. <b>A</b> <b>slap</b> emphasizes the (2,1), (0,2), (3,1), (1,2), and (0,3) modes (as well as higher-order modes) while suppressing the Helmholtz resonance and the (0,1) and (1,1) modes. Skilled players can also produce a medium-pitched sound (between a tone and slap) that is variously called third slap, tonpalo, or lé; this sound emphasizes the (1,1) mode while suppressing all other modes as much as possible.|$|E
25|$|As {{in several}} {{previous}} games, the U.S. team fell behind early. Vladimir Krutov deflected <b>a</b> <b>slap</b> shot by Alexei Kasatonov past U.S. goaltender Jim Craig at the 9:12 mark {{to give the}} Soviets a 1–0 lead, and after Buzz Schneider scored for the United States on a 50-foot shot from the left boards at 14:03 to tie the game, the Soviets struck again with a Sergei Makarov goal with 17:34 gone. With his team down 2–1, Craig improved his play, turning away many Soviet shots before the U.S. team had another shot on goal (the Soviet team had 39shots on goal in the game, the Americans 16).|$|E
25|$|In game three, Ben Lovejoy {{started off}} the scoring at 5:29 {{of the first}} period after his shot got {{deflected}} in off Sharks defenceman Roman Polak. The Sharks tied it up at 9:34 on Justin Braun's goal after receiving a pass from Joe Thornton. The Penguins got their second lead {{of the game in}} the second period with Ben Lovejoy's point shot being tipped in off forward Patric Hornqvist's stick. In the third period, Penguins forward Nick Bonino high-sticked Thornton (resulting in some blood being spilled) causing a four-minute power play for the Sharks. In the dying seconds of the power play, Joel Ward fired <b>a</b> <b>slap</b> shot that got past Matt Murray. In overtime, Joonas Donskoi fired a shot that went high over Murray into the net for the game winner.|$|E

25|$|In 1995, Yzerman led Detroit to {{its first}} Stanley Cup finals series since 1966, but the Red Wings were swept by the New Jersey Devils. Before {{the start of the}} 1995–96 NHL season, Yzerman's {{leadership}} was called into question and soon he had to deal with rumours that he was to be traded to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for Mathieu Schneider and a first-round draft pick, a deal that was publicized in Le Journal de Montréal as being pushed for hard by Yzerman's former coach Jacques Demers. Detroit finished the season with an NHL-record 62 regular season wins and were heavily favoured to win the Stanley Cup. Yzerman scored perhaps the most memorable goal of his career in the 1996 playoffs, stealing the puck from Wayne Gretzky and beating St. Louis Blues goaltender Jon Casey with <b>a</b> <b>slap</b> shot from the blue line to win the Western Conference Semifinals in double overtime of Game 7. The Red Wings, however, fell short of their ultimate goal, losing in six games to the Colorado Avalanche in the Western Conference Finals.|$|E
25|$|Vancouver {{opened the}} season in San Jose. Jason Garrison, {{a member of the}} top power play unit, scored a goal to give the Canucks the lead. Vancouver {{eventually}} lost 4–1. Having Garrison play with the top unit was seen as a change in philosophy from the previous season. He was originally brought in to help with the Cauncks inconsistent power play, however he was played sparingly with the top unit and the team finished 22nd of 30 in the League for power play percentage. During the game, Alexandre Burrows blocked <b>a</b> <b>slap</b> shot on a penalty kill, and suffered a hair line fracture to his foot, forcing him to miss 12 games. The Canucks earned Tortorella his first win as head coach with a 6–2 victory over Edmonton in the second game of the season. Läck made his NHL debut in the third game against the Calgary Flames. Tortorella altered his lines to get the team going, including splitting up Henrik and Daniel Sedin, something rarely done by Vigneault. The Canucks eventually won the game 5–4 in overtime on a Santorelli goal. Despite giving up four goals, Läck earned praise for his performance.|$|E
25|$|The 2008 UEFA Champions League Final was {{the first}} all English club final in European Cup/Champions League history, and was played out between Manchester United and Chelsea {{in front of a}} packed-out Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. United took the lead midway through the first half when Cristiano Ronaldo's header met Wes Brown's cross and bounced into the bottom {{left-hand}} corner of Petr Čech's goal. Poor defending, however, enabled Frank Lampard to equalise in the last minute of the first half. Although both sides created chances, the scoreline remained 1–1 until the end of extra time, and penalties loomed. Didier Drogba became the second player to be sent off in a European Cup/Champions League final in the second period of extra time for <b>a</b> <b>slap</b> on Nemanja Vidić. Extra time finished and a penalty shoot-out was to decide it. Both teams scored their first two penalties, but Cristiano Ronaldo's shot was saved by Petr Čech. For Chelsea's last penalty, however, captain John Terry slipped as he was taking the shot, and the ball hit the outside of the post and flew helplessly wide. In the second round of sudden death, Ryan Giggs successfully converted his penalty before Edwin van der Sar won the Champions' League for United by saving Nicolas Anelka's effort.|$|E
