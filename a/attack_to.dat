40|$|Abstract. The {{detection}} {{technology for}} malicious <b>attacks</b> <b>to</b> campus wireless network is analyzed. In this paper, a detection method based on PrefixSpan algorithm for malicious <b>attacks</b> <b>to</b> campus wireless network is adopted. Aiming at hostile <b>attacks</b> environment <b>to</b> the wireless network campus, the detection method is proposed {{to reduce the}} amount of computation and memory consumption, and through incremental learning to achieve training of large data, and improve performance of mining further. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm for hostile <b>attacks</b> detection <b>to</b> campus wireless network, can effectively improve accuracy and security of detection, and achieved the desired results...|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of the finger spinners' success, Australian captain Ian Johnson tried to convert Davidson into a left arm {{orthodox}} spinner. Davidson returned as Australia faced a fourth meeting with Laker and Lock, in a match against Surrey immediately after the two consecutive Test maulings.

One six that he lofted from Laker almost reached the iconic gasometer outside The Oval. The match was drawn, and Davidson took 2/50 including Eric Bedser and Laker in his new role as a slow bowler.|$|E
