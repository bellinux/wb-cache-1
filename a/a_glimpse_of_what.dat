5|$|The GWR {{attracted}} the attention of the artists from an early date. John Cooke Bourne's History and Description of the Great Western Railway was published in 1846 and contained a series of detailed lithographs of the railway that give readers <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the line looked like in the days before photography. J. M. W. Turner painted his Rain, Steam and Speed - The Great Western Railway in 1844 after looking out of the window of his train on Maidenhead Railway Bridge, and in 1862 William Powell Frith painted , a large crowd scene on the platform at Paddington. The station itself was initially painted for Powell by W Scott Morton, an architect, and a train was specially provided by the GWR for the painting, in front of which a variety of travellers and railway staff form an animated focal point.|$|E

The review continued: [...] "Sparkle in the Rain is <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>what's</b> {{to come from}} Simple Minds.

25|$|The {{spending}} saw a good return, with Chelsea finishing as Premiership runners-up (their best league finish for 49 years) {{and reaching}} the Champions League semi-finals after dramatically beating Arsenal in the quarter-finals. But Ranieri {{may have been}} sacked because of some bizarre tactical decisions in the semi-final loss against Monaco (for example, switching central midfielder Scott Parker to right-back and right-back Glen Johnson to centre-back to accommodate more attackers in the team) and for ending the season trophyless. Nevertheless, Ranieri was given a hero's send-off in his final match in charge. That match also gave Chelsea fans <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{could easily have been}} if not for Abramovich's takeover, as Chelsea handily beat Leeds United, who were relegated, managerless, virtually bankrupt and seemingly destined for oblivion. In Ranieri's place, Abramovich recruited José Mourinho (who had lifted two Portuguese league titles, a Portuguese Cup, a Champions League title and a UEFA Cup with Porto) as the club's new manager. Abramovich also brought legendary Dutch scout Piet de Visser, who scouted Ronaldo and Romário for PSV, and {{is considered one of the}} greatest scouts in history.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to [...] "Sunshine Days" [...] was mixed. Aaron Kinney from Salon {{magazine was}} critical of the producers' idea to air the entry as the penultimate episode {{leading up to the}} heavily-promoted series finale. Kinney pointed out that the episode {{had little to do with}} the show's overarching storyline, but it was nevertheless touted as part of The X-Files [...] "Endgame" [...] promotion strategy. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it a [...] "C" [...] grade. She sarcastically wrote, [...] "nine years of mytharc to start to wrap up. And so the penultimate episode of The X-Files, naturally, is devoted to The Brady Bunch." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. The two noted that the episode [...] "is not one of Gilligan's very best stories", citing issues with its tone and its characterization of Oliver Martin. The two, however, did praise Gilligan's humanized style, writing, [...] "he gives Scully the proof of the paranormal she's been needing" [...] but shows that the most important [...] "things to care about in life" [...] are [...] "humans". John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it a 7 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this was a pleasant yet bittersweet episode, one that leaves the characters in relative peace. It is the first time that we get <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the writers are thinking as the series comes to a close. Now all that's left is the mythology, which I can only hope will end on a similarly pleasant note." [...] M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, said that [...] "the central story falls a bit flat", but the episode worked well as a [...] "paean to medium of television itself" [...] and he felt it was an appropriate vehicle for the series' penultimate installment.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 2006, Phil Fontaine, National chief of the Assembly of First Nations, {{expressed}} disappointment over the Conservative government's refusal to honour the Kelowna Accord, endorsed by 14 jurisdictions (the federal government, 10 provinces, and three territories). Fontaine previously described the federal government's point person on Kelowna, Jim Prentice, as an [...] "honourable" [...] person sensitive to native concerns.

[...] In the federal budget of May 2006, Fontaine and other native leaders got <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> [...] "focused" [...] meant: just $450 million (over two years) was committed to implementing Kelowna, not the $1.64 billion for the first two years that Paul Martin had agreed to.|$|E

2500|$|In this battle, the {{two factors}} {{combined}} to give <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{would end the}} Plains Indians way of life since horses had made them true nomads. [...] Although the “Comanche” {{had always been a}} nomadic people, it was the horse that transformed them into a true nomad culture, and a very warlike one. [...] In the Journal of American History Pekka Hämäläinen [...] estimates, as do most military historians and cultural anthropologists, that it was around 1700 that the Comanche got access to a sufficient number of Spanish horses {{that they were able to}} make the leap from dog and human assisted nomadic hunter-gatherer to a true nomad culture. [...] The effects of this transformation were radical. [...] Because they were the first Plains tribe to fully incorporate the horse into their way of life, and into their way of making war, they were far and away the best at it [...] [...] Though it was rare, the only successes the Spanish ever had in battle with the Comanche were on occasions that they were able to take them by surprise. [...] However, since the Comanche became classic horse nomads, this was never easy to do. [...] It was only when the Rangers had adopted classic Comanche tactics of cold camps, forced marches, and use of scouts were they able to alter the dynamic of nomad cavalry attacking fixed settlements. [...] At Little Robe Creek, they in large part succeeded in surprising the Comanche.|$|E
2500|$|Ultimately, a {{breakthrough}} in the sessions was achieved. While jamming on a song called [...] "Sick Puppy"—an early version of [...] "Mysterious Ways"—the band tried different chord progressions for the bridge. The jam stopped and the Edge tried playing them alone on an acoustic guitar, as [...] "everyone was trying to decide if they were any good." [...] At the suggestion of producer Daniel Lanois, the Edge played two separate sections sequentially. The band liked the way it flowed and decided to try and play it together. Speaking of the improvisation, the Edge said, [...] "suddenly something very powerful [...] happening in the room." [...] He added, [...] "Everyone recognized {{it was a special}} piece. It was like we'd caught <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the song could be." [...] Soon afterwards, the band had developed the piece of music into [...] "One". [...] Bono recalls that [...] "the melody, the structure—the whole thing was done in 15 minutes". [...] He also stated that the lyrics [...] "just fell out of the sky, a gift"; the concept was inspired by the band members' fracturing relationships, the German reunification, and Bono's scepticism of the hippie idea of [...] "oneness". Bono later sent a note to the Dalai Lama declining an invitation to a festival called Oneness, incorporating a line from the song: [...] "One—but not the same". [...] The song's writing inspired the band and changed their outlook on the recording sessions. Mullen Jr. said the song reaffirmed the band's [...] "blank page approach" [...] to recording and reassured the band that all was not lost.|$|E
