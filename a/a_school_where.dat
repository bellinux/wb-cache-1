5|$|In 1965, Robert McSpadden and Bill Dickinson, both music {{teachers}} in the Cincinnati Public Schools, founded the Cincinnati All-City Boy Choir, where they were struck by how the discipline they established for {{the boys in the}} choir carried over into their academic studies. They conceived the idea of <b>a</b> <b>school</b> <b>where</b> basic education was combined with intensive attention to children with artistic talents. With the support of Waldrip and Tom Murray, director for the west-central division of Cincinnati elementary schools, they pushed for $119,000 as part of a tax levy referendum in May 1973; the measure was defeated. The school was approved with a drastically reduced budget of $27,000 plus $9,850 from the Board of Education’s general fund. They turned to private funding and won a $292,000 grant from J. Ralph Corbett, one of the city's foremost philanthropists for the arts, and $24,500 for a piano lab from the Baldwin Piano Company, which had manufactured pianos in Cincinnati since 1891.|$|E

In the beginning, the child lived a double life. In school, she was “Ben”; at home, she was Kate. Characteristics between the two identities drastically varied. Ben was quiet, shy and withdrawn, while Kate was extroverted and happy. Her parents could see that this was taking a toll on Kate and so they changed to <b>a</b> <b>school</b> <b>where</b> Kate could attend as herself. As the parent learned through this experience, supporting a child’s gender identity is extremely important.|$|E

500|$|Researchers of {{mathematics}} {{education at the}} University of Michigan have included the true-or-false prompt [...] "0 is an even number" [...] in a database of over 250 questions designed to measure teachers' content knowledge. For them, the question exemplifies [...] "common knowledge ... that any well-educated adult should have", and it is [...] "ideologically neutral" [...] in that the answer does not vary between traditional and reform mathematics. In a 2000–2004 study of 700 primary teachers in the United States, overall performance on these questions significantly predicted improvements in students' standardized test scores after taking the teachers' classes. In a more in-depth 2008study, the researchers found <b>a</b> <b>school</b> <b>where</b> all of the teachers thought that zero was neither odd nor even, including one teacher who was exemplary by all other measures. The misconception had been spread by a math coach in their building.|$|E
500|$|The {{imperial}} orphanage {{was restored}} after being damaged by earthquakes {{in the late}} reign of Romanos III Argyros, but had once more fallen into disrepair {{by the time of}} Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118), whose manifold charitable activities included its restoration and the foundation of a veritable township of charitable institutions around it for the blind, lamed and crippled, or elderly. Alexios endowed the institution with considerable revenue, and founded <b>a</b> <b>school</b> <b>where</b> the orphans could receive a free tuition. Alexios' son and successor, John II Komnenos (r. 1118–43), enlarged it further. During the period of the Latin Empire, its fate is unknown, but it is likely that like most Byzantine public buildings it fell into disrepair. As part of his wide-scale reconstruction of the city following its reconquest in 1261, Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–82) erected a school [...] "on the grounds of the old orphanotropheion", likely indicating that it had ceased to function for some time by then.|$|E
