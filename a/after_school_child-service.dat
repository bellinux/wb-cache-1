40|$|The {{purpose of}} this qualitative, interview-based {{study was to explore}} the {{leadership}} experiences of adolescent girls attending low income schools involved in a Girl Scouts <b>after</b> <b>school</b> program. This research study specifically focused on a Girl Scouts <b>after</b> <b>school</b> programs in a Midwest city. The qualitative study was based on insights obtained from adolescent girls who participated in a Girl Scouts <b>after</b> <b>school</b> program during the 2009 - 2010 academic year. Participants were individuals actively involved in a Girl Scouts <b>after</b> <b>school</b> program and supplemental activities provided by the program since August 2009. The participants’ ages and grade levels varied between 12 and 15 years of age and 6 th and 9 th grades for the 2009 - 2010 academic year. Participants were asked about their experiences in a Girl Scouts <b>after</b> <b>school</b> program through semi-structured, face to face interviews. These interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Each participant’s experience is described by their self-chosen pseudonym. To explore the leadership experiences of adolescent girls in a Girl Scouts <b>after</b> <b>school</b> program four research questions were developed for the study: How do girls describe their experiences, activities, and interests before joining this Girl Scouts <b>after</b> <b>school</b> program; How do girls describe their experiences, activities, and interests since joining this Girl Scouts <b>after</b> <b>school</b> program; How do girls describe their leadership philosophies since coming to this Girl Scouts <b>after</b> <b>school</b> program; and How do girls describe how this Girl Scouts <b>after</b> <b>school</b> program has impacted their lives? The study found that the participants describe a positive experience with a Girl Scouts <b>after</b> <b>school</b> program. A Girl Scouts <b>after</b> <b>school</b> program has given each participant insight on leadership, self-awareness, future goals, and involvement. Practitioners who develop <b>after</b> <b>school</b> programs can use the information found in this study to continue creating and providing opportunities for engaging and positive experiences for adolescent girls.
