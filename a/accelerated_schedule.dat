The Sound Transit Board officially approved an <b>accelerated</b> <b>schedule</b> for the South 200th Street station in July 2011, seeking a federal Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant of up to $34 million; a $10 million grant was awarded in December, allowing the opening date for the station to move from 2020 to September 2016.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To more {{precisely}} localize the dose-time boundary between head-and-neck radiotherapy schedules inducing tolerable and intolerable early mucosal reactions. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Total cell-kill biologically effective doses (BED(CK)) have been calculated for 84 schedules, including incomplete repair effects, but making no other corrections {{for the effect}} of schedule duration T. [BED(CK),T] scatterplots are graphed, overlying BED(CKboundary) (T) curves on the plots and using discriminant analysis to optimize BED(CKboundary) (T) to best represent {{the boundary between the}} tolerable and intolerable schedules. RESULTS: More overlap than expected is seen between the tolerable and intolerable treatments in the 84 -schedule [BED(CK),T] scatterplot, but this was largely eliminated by removing gap and tolerated <b>accelerating</b> <b>schedules</b> from the plot. For the remaining 57 predominantly regular schedules, the BED(CKboundary) (T) boundary increases with increasing T (p = 0. 0001), curving upwards significantly nonlinearly (p = 0. 00007) and continuing to curve beyond 15 days (p = 0. 035). The regular schedule BED(CKboundary) (T) boundary does not describe tolerability well for <b>accelerating</b> <b>schedules</b> (p = 0. 002), with several tolerated <b>accelerating</b> <b>schedules</b> lying above the boundary where regular schedules would be intolerable. Gap schedule tolerability also is not adequately described by the regular schedule boundary (p = 0. 04), although no systematic offset exists between the regular boundary and the overall gap schedule tolerability pattern. CONCLUSIONS: All schedules analyzed (regular, gap, and accelerating) with BED(CK) values below BED(CKboundary) (T) = 69. 5 x(T/ 32. 2) /sin((T/ 32. 2) ((radians))) - 3. 5 Gy(10) (forT< or = 50 days) are tolerable, and many lying above the boundary are intolerable. The <b>accelerating</b> <b>schedules</b> analyzed were tolerated better overall than are the regular schedules with similar [BED(CK),T] values...|$|R

25|$|In April 2013, during {{post-production}} of the retitled Fast & Furious 6, Lin {{announced that}} he would not return to direct a seventh film, as the studio wanted to produce the film on an <b>accelerated</b> <b>schedule</b> for release in summer 2014. This would have required Lin to begin pre-production on the sequel while performing post-production on Fast & Furious 6, which he considered would affect the quality of the final product. Despite the usual two-year gap between the previous installments, Universal chose to pursue a sequel quicker due to having fewer reliable franchises than its competitor studios. However, subsequent interviews with Lin have suggested that the sixth film was always intended to be the final installment under his direction.|$|E
25|$|After {{many years}} of being held on Mondays at 9:00pm Eastern/6:00 p.m Pacific, in 1999 the ceremonies were moved to Sundays at 8:30pm Eastern/5:30pm Pacific. The reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on Sundays, that Los Angeles rush-hour traffic jams could be avoided, and that an earlier start time would allow viewers on the East Coast {{to go to bed}} earlier. For many years the film {{industry}} had opposed a Sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office. The Academy has contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into January, citing TV viewers' fatigue with the film industry's long awards season. However, such an <b>accelerated</b> <b>schedule</b> would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members, to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers (as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail).

Allergenic potency determined by enzyme allergosorbent test (EAST) inhibition and skin prick test showed that modified P. judaica pollen had a 99 · 9 % less allergenicity than native extract. After 650 doses administered, two clinically irrelevant local reactions (diameter < 0 · 5 cm) and no systemic reactions were registered. Significant increases in allergen-specific IgG 4 and IgG against P. judaica extract and rPar j 2 and significant decrease of specific IgE against Par j 2 were observed.

500|$|Mazowiecki's government, {{forced to}} deal quickly with {{galloping}} hyperinflation, soon adopted radical economic policies, proposed by Leszek Balcerowicz, which transformed Poland into a functioning market economy under an <b>accelerated</b> <b>schedule.</b> Many Polish state owned enterprises, undergoing privatization, {{turned out to}} be woefully unprepared for capitalist competition and the pace of their accommodation (or attrition) was rapid. The economic reform, a shock therapy accompanied by comprehensive neoliberal restructuring, was in reality an extension of the previous incremental [...] "communist" [...] policies of the 1970s and 1980s, which were now followed by a leap to greatly expanded integration with the global economy with little protection. Among the reform's negative immediate effects were the economic recession and near-paralysis of foreign trade. On longer-term bases, the country experienced quickly rising unemployment and social inequities, as enterprises were liquidated and income was redistributed away from workers and farmers, in favor of the establishment and the entrepreneurial class. A collapse of Polish industry was among the detrimental consequences of fundamental and lasting importance. Labor unions underwent further marginalization; Solidarity activity as a labor union, prioritized in the past, was now suppressed. On the positive side, the market price-income reform balanced the economy and brought inflation under control, the currency stabilized, shortages were eliminated and significant foreign investment began. The shock therapy solutions were often dictated by Western consultants, of whom Jeffrey Sachs was best known but also most criticized.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: For {{stereotactic}} body radiotherapy (SBRT), {{typically a}} scheme of 60 Gy in 3 - 8 fractions is applied, producing local tumour control rates around 90 %. The dose specification {{is in one}} point only and ignores possible underdosages {{at the edge of}} the planning target volume (PTV). We investigated the doses {{at the edge of the}} PTV and correlated this with local tumour control with the aim to shed light on the radiation dose needed to eradicate stage I NSCLC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Published data on the freedom from local progression (FFLP) data from SBRT and accelerated high-dose conventional radiotherapy series for stage I NSCLC with a follow up of at least 30 months were included. The EQD(2,T) was calculated from the dose at the periphery of the PTV. RESULTS: Fifteen studies for SBRT (1076 patients) showed a median FFLP of 88. 0 ± 10. 4 % with a median EQD(2,T) of 76. 9 ± 17. 4 Gy. The median FFLP was 87. 6 ± 6. 0 % for the <b>accelerated</b> <b>schedules</b> with an EQD(2,T) of 86. 9 ± 39. 1 Gy, respectively. No significant relation was found between FFLP and the EQD(2,T) (p= 0. 23). CONCLUSIONS: Several fractionated and <b>accelerated</b> <b>schedules</b> with equal biological doses achieve the same tumour control rates as SBRT. Lower, but more uniform doses to the whole PTV may be sufficient to achieve similar control rates, with the possibility to deliver SBRT in adapted schedules, beneficial to centrally located tumours in the vicinity of critical structures like the oesophagus and great vessels. status: publishe...|$|R
