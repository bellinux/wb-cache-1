5|$|Calvin {{also wrote}} many letters and treatises. Following the Responsio ad Sadoletum, Calvin wrote <b>an</b> <b>open</b> <b>letter</b> {{at the request}} of Bucer to Charles V in 1543, Supplex exhortatio ad Caesarem, {{defending}} the reformed faith.

The pope proceeded to open the Council of Trent, which resulted in decrees against the reformers. Calvin refuted the decrees by producing the Acta synodi Tridentinae cum Antidoto in 1547. When Charles tried to find a compromise solution with the Augsburg Interim, Bucer and Bullinger urged Calvin to respond.
