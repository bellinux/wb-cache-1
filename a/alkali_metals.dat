5|$|The <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> are a group (column) in the {{periodic}} table consisting of the chemical elements lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs), and francium (Fr). This group lies in the s-block of {{the periodic}} table of elements as all <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> have their outermost electron in an s-orbital: this shared electron configuration results in them having very similar characteristic properties. Indeed, the <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> provide {{the best example of}} group trends in properties in {{the periodic table}}, with elements exhibiting well-characterised homologous behaviour.|$|E
5|$|The <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> are all shiny, soft, highly {{reactive}} metals at standard temperature and pressure and readily lose their outermost electron to form cations with charge +1. They {{can all be}} cut easily with a knife due to their softness, exposing a shiny surface that tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation by atmospheric moisture and oxygen (and {{in the case of}} lithium, nitrogen). Because of their high reactivity, they must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with air, and are found naturally only in salts and never as the free elements. Caesium, the fifth alkali metal, is the most reactive of all the metals. In the modern IUPAC nomenclature, the <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> comprise the group 1 elements, excluding hydrogen (H), which is nominally a group 1 element but not normally considered to be an alkali metal as it rarely exhibits behaviour comparable to that of the <b>alkali</b> <b>metals.</b> All the <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> react with water, with the heavier <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> reacting more vigorously than the lighter ones.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the organolithium compounds, the {{organometallic}} compounds of the heavier <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> are predominantly ionic. The application of organosodium compounds in chemistry {{is limited in}} part due to competition from organolithium compounds, which are commercially available and exhibit more convenient reactivity. The principal organosodium compound of commercial importance is sodium cyclopentadienide. Sodium tetraphenylborate can also be classified as an organosodium compound since in the solid state sodium is bound to the aryl groups. Organometallic compounds of the higher <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> are even more reactive than organosodium compounds and of limited utility. A notable reagent is Schlosser's base, a mixture of n-butyllithium and potassium tert-butoxide. This reagent reacts with propene to form the compound allylpotassium (KCH2CHCH2). cis-2-Butene and trans-2-butene equilibrate when in contact with <b>alkali</b> <b>metals.</b> Whereas isomerisation is fast with lithium and sodium, it is slow with the heavier <b>alkali</b> <b>metals.</b> The heavier <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> also favour the sterically congested conformation. Several crystal structures of organopotassium compounds have been reported, establishing that they, like the sodium compounds, are polymeric. Organosodium, organopotassium, organorubidium and organocaesium compounds are all mostly ionic and are insoluble (or nearly so) in nonpolar solvents.|$|E
40|$|An <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> filter {{having a}} layer of {{metallic}} bismuth deposited onto the <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> is provided. The metallic bismuth acts to stabilize {{the surface of the}} <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> to prevent substantial surface migration from occurring on the <b>alkali</b> <b>metal,</b> which may degrade optical characteristics of the filter. To this end, {{a layer of}} metallic bismuth is deposited by vapor deposition over the <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> to a depth of approximately 5 to 10 A. A complete <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> filter is described along with a method for fabricating the <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> filter...|$|R

5|$|All the <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> {{are highly}} {{reactive}} and are never found in elemental forms in nature. Because of this, {{they are usually}} stored in mineral oil or kerosene (paraffin oil). They react aggressively with the halogens to form the alkali metal halides, which are white ionic crystalline compounds that are all soluble in water except lithium fluoride (LiF). The <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> also react with water to form strongly alkaline hydroxides and thus should be handled with great care. The heavier <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> react more vigorously than the lighter ones; for example, when dropped into water, caesium produces a larger explosion than potassium if {{the same number of}} moles of each metal is used. The <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> have the lowest first ionisation energies in their respective periods of the periodic table because of their low effective nuclear charge and the ability to attain a noble gas configuration by losing just one electron. Not only do the <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> react with water, but also with proton donors like alcohols and phenols, gaseous ammonia, and alkynes, the last demonstrating the phenomenal degree of their reactivity. Their great power as reducing agents makes them very useful in liberating other metals from their oxides or halides.|$|E
5|$|The <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> {{all have}} the same crystal {{structure}} (body-centred cubic) and thus the only relevant factors are the number of atoms that can fit into a certain volume and the mass of one of the atoms, since density is defined as mass per unit volume. The first factor depends on the volume of the atom and thus the atomic radius, which increases going down the group; thus, the volume of an alkali metal atom increases going down the group. The mass of an alkali metal atom also increases going down the group. Thus, the trend for the densities of the <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> depends on their atomic weights and atomic radii; if figures for these two factors are known, the ratios between the densities of the <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> can then be calculated. The resultant trend is that the densities of the <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> increase down the table, with an exception at potassium. Due to having the lowest atomic weight of all the elements in their period and having the largest atomic radius for their periods, the <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> are the least dense metals in the periodic table. Lithium, sodium, and potassium are the only three metals in the periodic table that are less dense than water: in fact, lithium is the least dense known solid at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|The <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> {{are more}} similar to each other than the {{elements}} in any other group are to each other. For instance, when moving down the table, all known <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> show increasing atomic radius, decreasing electronegativity, increasing reactivity, and decreasing melting and boiling points as well as heats of fusion and vaporisation. In general, their densities increase when moving down the table, with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium.|$|E

40|$|Pure-silica ZSM- 12 is {{synthesized}} in {{the presence}} and absence of <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> ions; addition of <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> ions at constant hydroxide ion concentration increases the crystallization rate of ZSM- 12, and {{it is suggested that}} <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> ions participate in both the nucleation and crystal growth processes...|$|R
5|$|The atomic radii of the <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> {{increase}} {{going down}} the group. Because of the shielding effect, when an atom {{has more than one}} electron shell, each electron feels electric repulsion from the other electrons as well as electric attraction from the nucleus. In the <b>alkali</b> <b>metals,</b> the outermost electron only feels a net charge of +1, as some of the nuclear charge (which is equal to the atomic number) is cancelled by the inner electrons; the number of inner electrons of an alkali metal is always one less than the nuclear charge. Therefore, the only factor which affects the atomic radius of the <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> is the number of electron shells. Since this number increases down the group, the atomic radius must also increase down the group.|$|E
5|$|The ionic radii of the <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> {{are much}} smaller than their atomic radii. This is because the {{outermost}} electron of the <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> is in a different electron shell than the inner electrons, and thus when it is removed the resulting atom has one fewer electron shell and is smaller. Additionally, the effective nuclear charge has increased, and thus the electrons are attracted more strongly towards the nucleus and the ionic radius decreases.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of pure <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> is somewhat complicated {{due to their}} extreme reactivity with commonly used substances, such as water. From their silicate ores, all the stable <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> may be obtained the same way: sulfuric acid is first used to dissolve the desired alkali metal ion and aluminium(III) ions from the ore (leaching), whereupon basic precipitation removes aluminium ions from the mixture by precipitating it as the hydroxide. The remaining insoluble alkali metal carbonate is then precipitated selectively; the salt is then dissolved in hydrochloric acid to produce the chloride. The result is then left to evaporate and the alkali metal can then be isolated. Lithium and sodium are typically isolated through electrolysis from their liquid chlorides, with calcium chloride typically added to lower the melting point of the mixture. The heavier <b>alkali</b> <b>metals,</b> however, is more typically isolated in a different way, where a reducing agent (typically sodium for potassium and magnesium or calcium for the heaviest <b>alkali</b> <b>metals)</b> is used to reduce the alkali metal chloride. The liquid or gaseous product (the alkali metal) then undergoes fractional distillation for purification.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Alkali</b> <b>metal</b> alkoxides {{are often}} {{oligomeric}} or polymeric compounds, {{especially when the}} R group is small (Me, Et). [...] The alkoxide anion is a good bridging ligand, thus many alkoxides feature M2O or M3O linkages. In solution, the <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> derivatives exhibit strong ion-pairing, as expected for the <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> derivative of a strongly basic anion.|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of solvent water molecules around an <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> ion is calculated using Monte Carlo method and {{compared with the}} optimal configuration. The analysis of the orbital interaction between an <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> ion and the surrounding solvent molecules is performed for aqueous solutions of Li+, Na+ and K+, by means of ab initio MO method,with the aid of QM/MM method. The effect of <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> ion orbitals reaches as far as 6 Å, 7 Å and 9 Å for Li+, Na+ and K+, respectively. This effect {{is caused by the}} orbital interactions between the valence orbitals of an <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> ion and of the surrounding water molecules. Not only the electrostatic interaction but also the orbital interaction must not be neglected. The difference in the effect between the <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> ions is originated from the difference in the valence orbital extensions of the <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> ions. アルカリ金属イオン水溶液系について， 171 個の溶媒水分子を含めた系に対してモンテカルロ法によ り溶媒水分子の分布を求めた．さらに，イオンおよび 130 個程度までの溶媒水分子に対する非経験的 分子軌道法計算により，溶媒水分子に対するイオンの影響を明らかにした．アルカリ金属イオンの影 響は，イオンの最外殻軌道と水分子の軌道との軌道間相互作用に起因しており，イオンの種類によっ て影響範囲が異なる．イオンの種類による電荷分布の違いには，イオン半径ではなく，イオンの最外 殻軌道が到達する範囲の違いが重要である 1 章 コンピュータシミュレーションが拓く水系物質研究のフロンティ...|$|R
40|$|A new {{synthetic}} {{protocol for}} synthesising {{a number of}} BArF derivatives has been developed. Single crystal X-ray analysis of an array of <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> and ammonium salts has allowed {{the determination of the}} coordination sphere and/or the map of short contacts of the positively charged atoms. The increasing number of coordination bonds and/or short contacts between the <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> cation and the surrounding atoms has been rationalised in terms {{of the size of the}} <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> centre. It has also been demonstrated that an increase in the number of coordination bonds and/or short contacts translates into longer M–F distances. In the case of the ammonium BArF salts, the N–B distances are shorter than the M–B distances in the <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> BArF salts, indicating stronger interactions between the cationic nitrogen and the anionic boron than those between the boron and the <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> centres. Finally, a study of the structures of <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> hydrated and THF-solvated BArF salts showed that the interactions between the metal centre and the surrounding atoms depend not only on the size of the <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> centre but also on the occupancy of the first coordination sphere...|$|R
5|$|The reactivities of the <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> {{increase}} {{going down}} the group. This {{is the result of}} a combination of two factors: the first ionisation energies and atomisation energies of the <b>alkali</b> <b>metals.</b> Because the first ionisation energy of the <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> decreases down the group, it is easier for the outermost electron to be removed from the atom and participate in chemical reactions, thus increasing reactivity down the group. The atomisation energy measures the strength of the metallic bond of an element, which falls down the group as the atoms increase in radius and thus the metallic bond must increase in length, making the delocalised electrons further away from the attraction of the nuclei of the heavier <b>alkali</b> <b>metals.</b> Adding the atomisation and first ionisation energies gives a quantity closely related to (but not equal to) the activation energy of the reaction of an alkali metal with another substance. This quantity decreases {{going down the}} group, and so does the activation energy; thus, chemical reactions can occur faster and the reactivity increases down the group.|$|E

His version put all the <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> then known (lithium to caesium), as well as copper, silver, and thallium (which show the +1 oxidation state characteristic of the <b>alkali</b> <b>metals),</b> together into a group.

40|$|Mixed salts of Ionic Liquids (ILs) and <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> salts, {{developed}} as electrolytes for lithium and sodium batteries, {{have shown a}} remarkable ability to facilitate high rate capability for lithium and sodium electrochemical cycling. It {{has been suggested that}} {{this may be due to}} a high <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> ion transference number at concentrations approaching 50 mol% Li(+) or Na(+), relative to lower concentrations. Computational investigations for two IL systems illustrate the formation of extended alkali-anion aggregates as the <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> ion concentration increases.

5|$|Being {{the first}} period 8 element, ununennium is {{predicted}} to be an alkali metal, below lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and francium. Each of these elements has one valence electron in the outermost s-orbital (valence electron configuration ns1), which is easily lost in chemical reactions to form the +1 oxidation state: thus the <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> are very reactive elements.
