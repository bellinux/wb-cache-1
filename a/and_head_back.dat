5|$|Unable {{to capture}} Warsaw by a frontal assault, von Diebitsch devised {{a plan to}} outflank it and enter the city from the west. In early 1831 he sent his forces {{upstream}} on the Vistula, where the Russian divisions were to cross the river <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> north, towards Warsaw. The new plan was thwarted by the Polish defence in three successive battles around Wawer, Dębe Wielkie and Iganie.

5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{are sent}} on {{assignment}} {{to make a}} sales pitch to a client, and are eager to land the sale. However, Danny Cordray (Timothy Olyphant), a rival paper salesman from the very small Osprey company who steals more potential sales away from Dunder Mifflin than anyone, has also arrived for a sales pitch. Dwight also reveals that Danny had a romantic history with Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) four years previously. Jim and Dwight call in Michael Scott (Steve Carell), who is ecstatic at getting {{a chance to make}} a sale, to come and try to save them.

5|$|With a {{large part}} of the French Empire's forces now {{entangled}} in the bloody Peninsular War, the Austrian Empire believed that its best opportunity to avenge the humiliating defeat of 1805 had finally come. The Austrians were looking to defeat France and regain their former influence in Italy and Germany. In early 1809, the Austrian war preparations were so intense that Napoleon was forced to leave Spain <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> to Paris to reorganise his main army in Germany. In spring, Nansouty was therefore recalled to the command of 1st of the three heavy cavalry divisions of the Cavalry Reserve, placed this time under the command of Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bessières. As the War of the Fifth Coalition broke out, Nansouty's division was soon detached from the Reserve and temporarily attached to Marshal Louis Nicolas Davout's III Corps, the force that was assigned the most difficult tasks during the early military operations of this war. As Napoleon then ordered a concentration of the army at Ratisbon, Nansouty's division was once again put under the command of Bessières and sent to serve with the Bavarian army. After his initial victories at Abensberg and Landshut, Napoleon concentrated the bulk of his army, including Nansouty's men, at Eckmühl, where Davout was waiting.|$|E

25|$|At dawn on {{the next}} day, Loredan sent two galleys, bearing the Banner of Saint Mark, to the entry of the port of Gallipoli to open negotiations. In {{response}} the Turks sent 32 ships to attack them. Loredan withdrew his two galleys, and began to withdraw, while shooting at the Turkish ships, in order to lure them away from Gallipoli. As the Ottoman ships could {{not keep up with}} their oars, they set sail; on the Venetian side, the galley from Napoli di Romania tarried during the manoeuvre and was in danger of being caught by the pursuing Ottoman ships, so that Loredan likewise ordered his ships to set sail. Once they were had made ready for combat, Loredan ordered his ten galleys to lower sails, turn about, and face the Ottoman fleet. At that point, however, the eastern wind rose suddenly, and allowed the Ottomans to break off the pursuit <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> to Gallipoli. Loredan in turn tried {{to catch up with the}} Ottomans, firing at them with his guns and crossbows and launching grappling hooks at the Turkish ships, but the wind and the current allowed the Ottomans to retreat speedily behind the fortifications of Gallipoli. According to Loredan, the engagement lasted until the 22nd hour.|$|E

500|$|Atkinson was {{not told}} about Governor Reynolds' {{decision}} to order Major Isaiah Stillman's militia to march on Old Man's Creek, despite being in overall command. Reynolds' orders, issued {{on his behalf}} by General Samuel Whiteside to Stillman, were for Stillman to find Black Hawk and coerce him into submission. Following these orders, Stillman moved on Old Mans Creek. Whiteside had refused to accept Stillman's battalion under his command, thus leaving it [...] "orphaned" [...] and under the direct command of Governor Reynolds. The militia commanded by Whiteside grew restless as they awaited the arrival of Atkinson and his Army regulars; many of the volunteer militia wanted to quit the war <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> home. When diplomacy failed to persuade Black Hawk to take his band back west to Iowa, Stillman and Bailey's battalions of Illinois Militia were marched up the Rock River.|$|E

500|$|Bedell-Sivright was so {{impressed}} with Australia that he decided to settle there. After a year he became bored of jackarooing (stock-rearing), and decided to leave <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> to Scotland to study medicine. While studying in Edinburgh he joined the Edinburgh University RFCcaptaining them for two seasons in 1906–07 and 1908–09. He had returned to Scotland in time to face the touring New Zealanders, and so he captained his country against them at Inverleith. The All Blacks had not been troubled in any of their previous matches on tour, scoring 612 points, and conceding only 15. Rugby writer Winston McCarthy described the Scottish forwards as [...] "fast, vigorous and good dribblers", and they led 7–6 at half-time. However the New Zealanders were the better team, and scored six unanswered points in the second half to win 12–6.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues" [...] {{continues}} {{the theme of}} road weariness from the album's previous song, [...] "Highway 61 Revisited." [...] The singer finds himself in Juarez, Mexico, at Easter time, amidst sickness, despair, whores and saints. While there, he encounters corrupt authorities and women of dubious character, named in the song as [...] "Saint Annie" [...] and [...] "sweet Melinda", before seeking succor in drugs and alcohol. The song establishes a nightmare vision as the singer is influenced by gravity, negativity, sex, drugs, drink, illness, remorse and memory. In the song's final verse, the singer decides he has had enough and finds the means to leave it all behind <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> to New York City, where things may be better. Author Paul Williams has noted that scene and situation are combined into a gorgeous evocation of muddied consciousness in [...] "Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues", without ever resolving into {{a clear picture of}} what the song is about. Despite the sordid details of the singer's experiences in Juarez, the lyrics maintain a sense of humor, and William Ruhlmann of the AllMusic website considers the song a comic tour de force.|$|E

50|$|Such is life. After {{five or six}} reboots and the {{reconfiguration}} of a few drivers, {{things began}} to look better.

Astrium was involved in developing a European Space Agency plan for a sample return mission to Mars, as part of the ESA's Aurora programme, and sending a mission to Phobos with its low gravity was seen as a good opportunity for testing and proving the technologies required for an eventual sample return mission to Mars. The mission was envisioned to start in 2016, was to last for three years.

He and other captives taken by the patrol were still escorted east toward Lexington, until about a half mile from Lexington they heard a gunshot. The British major demanded Revere explain the gunfire, and Revere replied it was a signal to [...] "alarm the country". As the group drew closer to Lexington, the town bell began to clang rapidly, upon which one of the captives proclaimed to the British soldiers [...] "The bell's a'ringing! The town's alarmed, and you're all dead men!" [...] The British soldiers gathered and decided not to press further towards Lexington but instead to free the prisoners <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> to warn their commanders. The British confiscated Revere's horse and rode off to warn the approaching army column. Revere walked to Rev. Jonas Clarke's house, where Hancock and Adams were staying. As the battle on Lexington Green unfolded, Revere assisted Hancock and his family in their escape from Lexington, helping to carry a trunk of Hancock's papers.|$|E
