A high signal-to-noise measurement of the recoil spectrum will not only serve an important milestone in achieving the sensitivity necessary for measuring coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering, but will break new scientific ground by providing a first ever measurement of low-energy quenching factors in argon. Coherent scattering occurs when the momentum transfer from a neutrino to the nucleus is much smaller than the inverse size of the recoil nucleus. A detection of coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering would verify an unconfirmed Standard Model prediction [1], explore non-standard neutrino-quark interactions, confirm stellar collapse and supernova energy transport and neutrino opacity models, and could be applied to the measurement of the flavor-blind neutrino spectrum from next nearby supernova, or could be used to promote non-intrusive reactor power monitoring [2]. We propose detecting the ionization induced by recoiling argon nuclei using a 10 kg dual-phase argon detector. The principle of dual-phase detection has been described elsewhere [3]. We propose using a 3 GW commercial nuclear reactor as a source of antineutrinos. We have designed and built a gas-phase prototype of the detector with which we have measured the 200 -electron equivalent ionization signals from a 6 keV Fe- 55 source with a signal-to-noise threshold of 50 electrons. This prototype also enables study of scintillation properties of Argon and investigation of electron and nuclear recoils in Argon. We will measure medium energy neutron-nuclear recoils in our prototype detector using the recently-commissioned LLNL compact pulsed neutron source...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Nowadays, in many {{different}} fields of chemical agents several experimental researches is being done on volatile organic compounds using gas chromatography, which is time consuming and expensive methods. Photo <b>ionization</b> <b>detector</b> as an alternative method is used by researchers in this field. This feasibility {{study was conducted to}} replace the photo <b>ionization</b> <b>detector</b> with gas chromatography.. Material and Method: In this study, after making pre-determined concentrations of Xylene, the results of measurements using photo <b>ionization</b> <b>detector</b> and reference method were compared. This comparison was done in 4 humidity levels and 3 concentration ranges.. Result: The results showed significant differences in photo <b>ionization</b> <b>detector</b> readout and the reference method. However correlation coefficient of two methods were more than 0. 99 in all cases regardless of the humidity rate.. Conclusion: Although the results obtained by the photo <b>ionization</b> <b>detector</b> are different from those extracted from the reference method in the current study, due to linear response of the method correlation coefficient was at good level. Consequently, in case of studying concentration changes in a research, this alternative method would be applicable, otherwise calibration of the photo <b>ionization</b> <b>detector</b> with the target material is recommended...|$|R
