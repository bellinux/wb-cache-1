5|$|An agency {{relationship}} is between three parties - a principal, who authorises <b>an</b> <b>agent</b> {{to make a}} contract on his behalf with a third party. In agency situations <b>an</b> <b>agent</b> can make a contract with a third party that is binding on the principal, even though he was not privy to the original contract. The right of <b>an</b> <b>agent</b> to make this sort of agreement is found in statute, such as the Consumer Credit Act 1974 which allows a dealer for a financial company to set up credit agreements as a representative of that company.|$|E

40|$|There is an {{important}} sense in which <b>an</b> <b>agent’s</b> credences are universal: while they reflect <b>an</b> <b>agent’s</b> own judgments, those judgments apply equally to everyone’s bets. This point, while uncontentious, has been overlooked; people automatically assume that credences concern <b>an</b> <b>agent’s</b> own bets, perhaps {{just because of the}} name “subjective” that is typically applied to this account of belief. This oversight has had unfortunate consequences for recent epistemology, in particular concerning the Sleeping Beauty case and its myriad variants...|$|R

40|$|We {{argue that}} rather than {{representing}} <b>an</b> <b>agent's</b> knowledge as <b>a</b> collection of formulas, and then doing theorem proving {{to see if a}} given formula follows from <b>an</b> <b>agent's</b> knowledge base, it may be more useful to represent this knowledge by a semantic model, and then do model checking to see if the given formula is true in that model.

40|$|Many {{applications}} of intelligent systems require reasoning about the mental states of {{agents in the}} domain. We may want to reason about <b>an</b> <b>agent’s</b> beliefs, including beliefs about other agents; we {{may also want to}} reason about <b>an</b> <b>agent’s</b> preferences, and how his beliefs and preferences relate to his behavior. We define a probabilistic epistemic logic (PEL) in which belief statements are given a formal semantics, and provide an algorithm for asserting and querying PEL formulas in Bayesian networks. We then show how to reason about <b>an</b> <b>agent’s</b> behavior by modeling his decision process as an influence diagram and assuming that he behaves rationally. PEL can then be used for reasoning from <b>an</b> <b>agent’s</b> observed actions to conclusions about other aspects of the domain, including unobserved domain variables and the agent’s mental states. ...|$|R
