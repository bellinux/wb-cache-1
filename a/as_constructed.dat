However, the proposed overhead wires were deemed too ugly for the new bridge, and between £30,000 and £40,000 could be saved by using buses instead. The routes using the Causeway were replaced with bus services, but the bridges <b>as</b> <b>constructed</b> were nonetheless designed to be able to carry trams.|$|E

25|$|Psychology of the sacred, {{taking stock}} of the human condition, conveys that people {{construct}} meaning from that which is without meaning; stated differently, culture gives context to lived experience. Therefore, both meaning and absence of meaning {{may be perceived as}} being co-existents. Cultural context <b>as</b> <b>constructed</b> meaning and memetic transmission engenders social, existential, and spiritual comfort in a tenuous and arbitrary lived experience and millieu: perception as a participatory event parsing experience into meaningful units. The crossroads or intersections of evolutionary psychology of religion, pattern recognition, neuroaesthetics and symbolic communication lend to the construction of meanings as group cohesion and bond-forming in human society.|$|E

25|$|Creation of {{the park}} had {{immediate}} benefits to some Virginians. During the Great Depression, many young men received training and jobs through the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). The first CCC camp in Virginia {{was established in the}} George Washington National Forest near Luray, and Governor Pollard quickly filled his initial quota of 5,000 workers. About 1,000 men and boys worked on Skyline Drive, and about 100,000 worked in Virginia during the agency's existence. In Shenandoah Park, CCC crews removed many of the dead chestnut trees whose skeletons marred views in the new park, as well <b>as</b> <b>constructed</b> trails and facilities. Tourism revenues also skyrocketed. On the other hand, CCC crews were also assigned to burn and destroy some cabins in the park, to prevent residents from coming back. Also, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes who had jurisdiction over the NPS and partial jurisdiction over the CCC, tried to use his authority to force Byrd to cooperate on other New Deal projects.|$|E
25|$|During the Polish-Soviet War of 1920 {{the city}} was {{attacked}} {{by the forces of}} Alexander Yegorov. Since mid-June 1920 the 1st Cavalry Army of Semyon Budyonny was trying to reach the city from the north and east. At the same time Lwów was preparing the defence. The inhabitants raised and fully equipped three regiments of infantry and two regiments of cavalry as well <b>as</b> <b>constructed</b> defensive lines. The city was defended by an equivalent of three Polish divisions aided by one Ukrainian infantry division. Finally after almost a month of heavy fighting on August 16 the Red Army crossed the Bug river and, reinforced by additional 8 divisions of the so-called Red Cossacks, started an assault on the city. The fighting occurred with heavy casualties on both sides, but after three days the assault was halted and the Red Army retreated. For the heroic defence {{the city was}} awarded with the Virtuti Militari medal.|$|E
25|$|According to Zycher, Mishori kept $7,700 of {{the payment}} {{and gave the}} rest to Karagula and Ben-Ezra to erect the bridge. Karagula and Ben-Ezra hired Bar-Ilan to design and oversee the bridge's construction. Bar-Ilan claimed that his bridge as {{designed}} would support 250kg per square metre, which did not meet Israeli government standards, which required a pedestrian bridge to support 500kg per square metre. In any event, the Dotan investigation found that the bridge was far weaker than what Bar-Ilan claimed. Furthermore, a municipal permit was required to construct the bridge, which Karagula and Ben-Ezra did not obtain. The municipality in which the bridge was constructed was Ramat Gan. Zvi Bar, Ramat Gan's mayor {{and head of the}} city planning division which issued construction permits, {{was a member of the}} Maccabiah committee that helped select Irgunit. Bar apparently did not ensure that Irgunit, Karagula, or Ben-Ezra obtained the necessary permit and made no effort to ensure that the bridge <b>as</b> <b>constructed</b> was safe.|$|E

25|$|<b>As</b> <b>constructed</b> popularly {{through the}} Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, relativists {{believe that the}} {{structure}} of a particular language is capable of influencing the cognitive patterns through which a person shapes his or her world view. Universalists believe that there are commonalities between human perception as there is in the human capacity for language, while relativists believe that this varies from language to language and person to person. While the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis is an elaboration of this idea expressed through the writings of American linguists Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf, it was Sapir's student Harry Hoijer who termed it thus. The 20th century German linguist Leo Weisgerber also wrote extensively about the theory of relativity. Relativists argue for the case of differentiation at the level of cognition and in semantic domains. The emergence of cognitive linguistics in the 1980s also revived an interest in linguistic relativity. Thinkers like George Lakoff have argued that language reflects different cultural metaphors, while the French philosopher of language Jacques Derrida's writings have been seen to be closely associated with the relativist movement in linguistics, especially through deconstruction and was even heavily criticized in the media {{at the time of his}} death for his theory of relativism.|$|E

500|$|Early {{gunpowder}} {{weapons were}} introduced to Scotland by the 1330s. The new technology began to be installed in Scottish castles by the 1380s, beginning with Edinburgh. In the fifteenth century, gunpowder weaponry fundamentally altered the nature of castle architecture. Existing castles were adapted to allow {{the use of the}} new weapons by the incorporation of [...] "keyhole" [...] gun ports, platforms to mount guns and walls that were adapted to resist bombardment. Ravenscraig, Kirkcaldy, begun about 1460, is probably the first castle in the British Isles to be built as an artillery fort, incorporating [...] "D-shape" [...] bastions that would better resist cannon fire and on which artillery could be mounted. It also used [...] "letter box" [...] gun-ports, common in mainland Europe, although rarer in England, they rapidly spread across the kingdom. Scotland also led the way in adopting the new caponier design for castle ditches, <b>as</b> <b>constructed</b> at Craignethan Castle.|$|E

500|$|Henry V {{built the}} first {{permanent}} fortifications of Portsmouth. In 1416, a number of French ships blockaded Portsmouth, which housed ships that were set to invade Normandy. Instead, Henry gathered a fleet at Southampton and invaded the Norman coast in August of that year. Recognising the town's growing importance, he ordered a wooden Round Tower to be built {{at the mouth of}} the harbour, which was completed in 1426. Henry VII rebuilt the fortifications with stone, assisted Robert Brygandine and Sir Reginald Bray in the construction of the world's first dry dock, and raised the Square Tower in 1494. During his reign, HenryVII made Portsmouth a Royal Dock, and was England's only dockyard to be considered [...] "national" [...] at the time. Although King Alfred may have used Portsmouth to build ships as early as the 9th century, the first warship recorded <b>as</b> <b>constructed</b> in the town was the Sweepstake, built in the dry dock in 1497.|$|E
500|$|Durkheim {{also argued}} that our primary {{categories}} for understanding the world have their origins in religion. It is religion, Durkheim writes, {{that gave rise to}} most if not all other social constructs, including the larger society. Durkheim argued that categories are produced by the society, and thus are collective creations. Thus as people create societies, they also create categories, but at the same time, they do so unconsciously, and the categories are prior to any individual's experience. In this way Durkheim attempted to bridge the divide between seeing categories <b>as</b> <b>constructed</b> out of human experience and as logically prior to that experience. Our understanding of the world is shaped by social facts; for example the notion of time is defined by being measured through a calendar, which in turn was created to allow us to keep track of our social gatherings and rituals; those in turn on their most basic level originated from religion. In the end, even the most logical and rational pursuit of science can trace its origins to religion. Durkheim states that, [...] "Religion gave birth to all that is essential in the society.|$|E
500|$|Cannons {{continued}} to be improved during the 15th and 16th centuries. Castle loopholes were adapted to allow cannons and other firearms {{to be used in}} a defensive role, but offensively gunpowder weapons still remained relatively unreliable. England had lagged behind Europe in adapting to this new form of warfare; Dartmouth and Kingswear Castles, built in the 1490s to defend the River Dart, and Bayard's Cover, designed in 1510 to defend Dartmouth harbour itself, were amongst the few English castles designed in the continental style during the period, and even these lagged behind the cutting edge of European design. Scottish castles were more advanced in this regard, partially {{as a result of the}} stronger French architectural influences. Ravenscraig Castle in Scotland, for example, was an early attempt in the 1460s to deploy a combination of [...] "letter box" [...] gun-ports and low-curved stone towers for artillery weapons. These letter box gun-ports, common in mainland Europe, rapidly spread across Scotland but were rarely used in England during the 15th century. Scotland also led the way in adopting the new caponier design for castle ditches, <b>as</b> <b>constructed</b> at Craignethan Castle.|$|E
