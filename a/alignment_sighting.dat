40|$|The {{results are}} {{presented}} of a study which uses fuzzy sets to model a Space Shuttle pilot's reasoning and actions while performing rendezvous proximity operation maneuvers. In this model fuzzy sets are used to simulate smooth and continuous actions {{as would be expected}} from an experienced pilot and to simulate common sense reasoning in the decision process. The present model assumes visual information available to the Shuttle pilot from the Shuttle Crew Optical <b>Alignment</b> <b>Sighting</b> (COAS) device and the overhead window and rendezvous radar sensor information available to him from an onboard display. This model will be used in a flight analysis simulator to perform studies requiring a large number of runs, each of which currently needs an engineer in the loop to supply the piloting decisions. This work has much broader implications in control of robots such as the Flight Telerobotic Servicer, in automated pilot control and attitude control, and in advisory and evaluation functions {{that could be used for}} flight data monitoring or for testing of various rule sets in flight preparation...|$|E

More recently, teleoperated systems using the same sort of targets have been used. Most experiments with completely autonomous docking systems also rely on similar targets.

This paper describes a new docking system currently undergoing testing. This system uses three o#set color markers. The markers use bright colors which are ordinarily not seen in an orbital setting.

The LM Abort Guidance System (AGS), Control Electronics System (CES) and other LM-specific hardware are also addressed. Three subsystems exist on each vehicle: the computer subsystem (CSS), the inertial subsystem (ISS) and the optical subsystem (OSS). The CSS and ISS are almost identical between CSM and LM and each is designed to operate independently. CSM SCS hardware are highlighted, including translation control, rotation controls, gyro assemblies, a gyro display coupler and flight director attitude indicators. The LM AGS hardware are also highlighted and include the abort electronics assembly and the abort sensor assembly; while the LM CES hardware includes the attitude controller assembly, thrust/translation controller assemblies and the ascent engine arming assemble.

There is an optical <b>alignment</b> <b>sight.</b> The RPK-2 radar proved to have good protection against enemy passive electronic radar counter-measures. Nevertheless, the radar system of the ZSU-23-4 has a short detection range during target search, depending on weather conditions (mainly dependent on rain and snow conditions). It is hard to automatically track the target at ranges less than 7-8 km (4.3-5.0 mi) {{because of the high}} angular speed of the target at close distances. The radar needs to be reset quite often because of the unstable parameters of electronic cathode-ray tubes of the target selection system.

40|$|Crew Optical <b>Alignment</b> <b>Sights</b> (COAS) {{are used}} by {{spacecraft}} pilots to provide a visual reference to a target spacecraft for lateral relative position during rendezvous and docking operations. NASA s Orion vehicle, which is currently under development, has not included a COAS in favor of automated sensors, but the crew office has requested such a device be added for situational awareness and contingency support. The current Space Shuttle COAS was adopted from Apollo heritage, weighs several pounds, {{and is no longer}} available for procurement which would make re-use difficult. In response, a study was conducted to examine the possibility of converting a commercially available weapons sight to a COAS for the Orion spacecraft. The device used in this study was the XPS series Holographic Weapon Sight (HWS) procured from L- 3 EOTech. This device was selected because the targeting reticule can subtend several degrees, and display a graphic pattern tailored to rendezvous and docking operations. Evaluations of the COAS were performed in both the Orion low-fidelity mockup and rendezvous simulations in the Reconfigurable Operational Cockpit (ROC) by crewmembers, rendezvous engineering experts, and flight controllers at Johnson Space Center. These evaluations determined that this unit s size and mounting options can support proper operation and that the reticule visual qualities are as good as or better than the current Space Shuttle COAS.

40|$|During {{the last}} few years, a lot of road-accident-predictive models have been {{developed}} by using Multiple Linear Regression and Poisson or Negative Binomial Distribution. More innovative methodologies based on fuzzy logic and neural networks have also been used. The application of these methodologies is not easy when {{a large number of}} variables is considered. Moreover, the influence of some variables on road accidents might not be equally significant. It would thus appears useful to have an analysis tool primarily in order to remove the redundant variables for accident-predictive models. Even if under-used in crash data, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) may be suitable for this purpose. PCA is a form of analysis used for extracting a reduced number of factors, called principal components, from a set of original variables, discarding as little of the information as possible. Our objective is to verify PCA potentiality for removing redundant variables in accident analysis. For this purpose a five-year monitoring period was carried out on a four-lane median divided road. A database was subsequently created with the surveys regarding the type and number of accidents, traffic flow, horizontal and vertical <b>alignment,</b> <b>sight</b> distances and pavement surface characteristics. PCA was applied to homogeneous sections having constant horizontal curvature, separated into tangents and curves. By means of the correlation matrix the results indicate that the number of accidents on curves increases with the length (L) of the homogeneous sections, the curvature radius (1 /R), the average daily traffic (TGM) and the design speed change (ΔV) between tangents and curves; whereas there is a negative correlation between these crashes and the longitudinal slope (i...|$|R
40|$|NASA s Space Shuttle {{was built}} to {{withstand}} multiple failures while still keeping the crew and vehicle safe. Although {{the design of the}} Space Shuttle {{had a great deal of}} redundancy built into each system, there were often additional ways to keep systems in the best configuration if a failure were to occur. One such method was to use select pieces of hardware in a way for which they were not primarily intended. The primary function of the Heads-Up Display (HUD) was to provide the crew with a display of flight critical information during the entry phase. The primary function of the Crew Optical <b>Alignment</b> <b>Sight</b> (COAS) was to provide the crew an optical alignment capability for rendezvous and docking phases. An alignment device was required to keep the Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) well aligned for a safe Entry; nominally this alignment device would be the two on-board Star Trackers. However, in the event of a Star Tracker failure, the HUD or COAS could also be used as a backup alignment device, but only if the device had been calibrated beforehand. Once the HUD or COAS was calibrated and verified then it was considered an adequate backup to the Star Trackers for entry IMU alignment. There were procedures in place and the astronauts were trained on how to accurately calibrate the HUD or COAS and how to use them as an alignment device. The calibration procedure for the HUD and COAS had been performed on many Shuttle missions. Many of the first calibrations performed were for data gathering purposes to determine which device was more accurate as a backup alignment device, HUD or COAS. Once this was determined, the following missions would frequently calibrate the HUD in order to be one step closer to having the device ready in case it was needed as a backup alignment device...|$|R
50|$|Even a tiny {{error in}} the angle of <b>sight</b> <b>alignment</b> results in a {{trajectory}} that diverges from the target on a trajectory directly relative to {{the distance from the}} target, causing the bullet to miss the target; for example, with a 10 meter air rifle shooter trying to hit the 10 ring, which is merely a 0.5 mm diameter dot on the target at 10 m and with a 4.5 mm diameter pellet, an error of only 0.2 mm in <b>sight</b> <b>alignment</b> can mean a complete miss (a 3 mm point of impact miss). At 1000 m, that same misalignment would be magnified 100 times, giving an error of over 300 mm, 1,500 times the sight misalignment. Increasing the distance between the front and rear sights, called the sight radius or sighting line, helps to reduce eventual angle errors and will, in case the sight has an incremental adjustment mechanism, adjust in smaller increments when compared to a further identical shorter sighting line. With the front sight on {{the front end of the}} barrel, sight radius may be increased by moving the rear sight from the barrel onto the receiver or tang.|$|R

Two of the study sites have no restrictive geometry representing base conditions, another two have restrictive curve radii, and the other three have restrictive radii and sight distances.

50|$|Telescopic sights {{have both}} {{advantages}} and disadvantages relative to iron sights. Standard doctrine with iron sights is to focus the eye on the front sight and align it with the resulting blur of the target and the rear sight; most shooters have difficulty doing this, as the eye tends to be drawn to the target, blurring both sights. Gun users over 30 years of age with keen eyesight will find it harder to keep the target, front sight element and rear sight element in focus well enough for aiming purposes, as human eyes gradually lose focusing flexibility with rising age, due to presbyopia. Telescopic sights allow the user to focus on both the crosshair and the target at the same time, as the lenses project the crosshair into the distance (50 m or yd for rimfire scopes, 100 m or yd more for centerfire calibers). This, combined with telescopic magnification, clarifies the target and makes it stand out against the background. The main disadvantage of magnification is that the area {{to either side of}} the target is obscured by the tube of the sight. The higher the magnification, the narrower the field of view in the sight, and the more area is hidden. Rapid fire target shooters use reflex sights, which have no magnification; this gives them the best field of view while maintaining the single focal plane of a telescopic sight. Telescopic sights are expensive and require additional training to align. <b>Sight</b> <b>alignment</b> with telescopic <b>sights</b> is a matter of making the field of vision circular to minimize parallax error. For maximum effective light-gathering and brightest image, the exit pupil should equal the diameter of the fully dilated iris of the human eye — about 7 mm, reducing with age.|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of in situ, {{remotely}} monitored magnetism-based sensor is presented that is comprised of an array of magnetically soft, magnetostatically-coupled ferromagnetic thin-film elements or particles combined with a chemically responsive material that swells or shrinks {{in response to the}} analyte of interest. As the chemically responsive material changes size the distance between the ferromagnetic elements changes, altering the inter-element magnetostatic coupling. This in turn changes the coercive force of the sensor, the amplitude of the voltage spikes detected in nearby pick-up coils upon magnetization reversal and the number of higher-order harmonics generated by the flux reversal. Since the sensor is monitored through changes in magnetic flux, no physical connections such as wires or cables are needed to obtain sensor information, nor is line of <b>sight</b> <b>alignment</b> required as with laser telemetry; the sensors can be detected from within sealed, opaque or thin metallic enclosures...|$|R

Most of these roads, however, share a common characteristic of being “unsafe at any speed”, {{at any time of}} the day. This is {{as a result of the}} low quality of the road components, structures and patterns. For example, road surfaces are undulating and rough. Also, the poor standard of road infrastructure like guard railings/barriers; pavement marking and signs; illumination levels, traffic signals, horizontal/vertical <b>alignment</b> and <b>sight</b> lines contribute largely to the increasing carnage on Nigerian road network. This trend persists because authorities in Nigeria have practically relegated to the background regular road safety audit operations. This is an inevitable aspect of modern methods of road administration and management, which determines a number of traffic potentials concerning highway high collision locations; protection of errant vehicles from light poles, trees, ditches, replacement of damaged and missing signs, street lighting, capacity and level of service analysis. Finally, this paper suggests commissioning of a National Road Research Fund, with a view to developing an efficient road safety audit operational system. Also, the introduction of private initiatives and a Community-based Approach in road administration, as well as decentralization of road administration framework at all levels, will greatly help “engineer out” potentially unsafe features across Nigerian roads, towards a better road traffic environment in the 21 st century...|$|R

It has been described as presenting one of the best examples of a Roman road, 60 ft wide with a ditch on each side. It has little claim to be so considered, and the ditches where they occur appear to be connected with modern drainage. To the north of the park, about half-a‑mile through the private residential estate Little Aston Park where it is named Roman Road, a short length of road north of Little Aston, Forge Lane, and another length to the west of Shenstone, mark the course of the road in a straight line from Streetley Hill to high ground 450 ft, on the north-east of Wall. From near Birmingham to Wall (Etocetum) for nine miles the road is not perceptibly out of a straight line, which may very well have been set out from intermediate points at Streetley Hill, and the high ground 500 ft, south of the old Royal Oak Inn.

Separate models were developed for total crashes and severe (fatal plus all injury) crashes. Generalized linear modeling techniques were used to fit the models, and a negative binomial distribution error structure was assumed. The study made use of a sample of 2, 245 crashes (728 severe crashes) that occurred in the period 2001 – 2005 in the Motorway A 16 Naples-Canosa in Italy. Many characteristics of the motorway are sub-standard. It allowed to investigate a wide spectrum of geometric configurations. The models were developed by the stepwise forward procedure using explanatory variables related to: traffic volume and composition, horizontal alignment, vertical <b>alignment,</b> design consistency, <b>sight</b> distance, roadside context, cross-section, speed limits, and interchange ramps. The decision on whether or not to keep a variable in the model was based on two criteria. The first was whether the t-ratio of the variable’s estimated coefficient is significant at the 5 % level. The second criterion is based on the improvement of the goodness of fit measures of the model that includes that variable. Goodness of fit measures were the parameter R 2 á and the Akaike’s Information Criterion. All the parameters have a logical and expected sign. Most important result is that design consistency measures significantly affect road safety not only on two-lane rural highways but also on motorways...|$|R

40|$|Rural two-lane {{highways}} {{constitute the}} majority of the road system in the United States. Over 62 percent of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) center line highway miles are two-lane highways. No-passing zones, which are indicated by solid lines separating the traffic moving in opposite directions, tell drivers where there are segments of two-lane highways that do not have sufficient sight distance to safely perform passing maneuvers. This study describes a method for automating the process for locating no-passing zones using global positioning system (GPS) data. The author developed a new analytical algorithm to evaluate three-dimensional passing sight distances that will work for any arbitrary alignment of two-lane highway. The algorithm was incorporated into a computer model that uses GPS data as the input and results in the locations for no-passing zones. The steps involved in the process include collecting the GPS data, converting it to a form that models the roadway center line, evaluating the availability of passing sight distance, and determining the locations where no-passing zone markings should be placed. The resulting automated system processes GPS coordinates and converts them into easting and northing values, smoothes GPS data and evaluates roadway <b>alignments</b> for possible <b>sight</b> restrictions that indicate where no-passing zones should be located. The automated system was tested on three highway segments using two different GPS receivers, and the results obtained were in general agreement with the existing locations of no-passing zone markings. The verification results indicate that the algorithm and the computer program developed in this dissertation can be used to determine the availability of passing sight distance and locate no-passing zones...|$|R

Specifically, I investigate how employee knowledge of (1) a change objective (i. e., line of sight objectives) and (2) how to best affect the objective (i. e., line of sight actions) changes following the introduction of a change initiative. To better understand potential attributes that may affect the trajectory of the line of sight constructs, I take a social cognitive approach to suggest five potential moderators (i. e., locus of control, interaction quality, valence, learning goal orientation, self-efficacy) based on the five core concepts of social cognitive theory (i. e., agency, observational learning, valued outcomes, goals, self-efficacy). Additionally, I propose a potential trajectory for behavioral alignment, based on a theory of change momentum; and, I examine the potential moderating effects of learning on the behavioral alignment trajectory. I also examine a potential pathway in which line of sight actions mediate the relationship between line of sight objectives and behavioral alignment with the same five social cognitive facets as proposed moderators. In a sample of 189 fast food employees, partial support is found for the alignment model. Line of sight objectives influences both line of sight actions and behavioral <b>alignment.</b> Line of <b>sight</b> actions also predicted performance. When looking at the trajectories, the time period encompassing the intervention saw significant gains in line of sight objectives, but not line of sight actions. The change in line of sight objectives and line of sight actions also predicted the change in behavioral alignment. Implications and future directions for research are discussed...|$|R
