5|$|The tale's disappointing qualities {{have been}} {{ascribed}} to Potter's growing {{lack of interest}} in writing for children, to pressure from her publisher for yet another book, and to Potter's desire to exploit the lucrative American market. Potter's artistically successful books were written for specific children; Timmy Tiptoes however was composed for Potter's amorphous, ill-defined American fanbase. By 1911, the demands of her <b>aging</b> <b>parents</b> and the business operations at her working farm, Hill Top, occupied much of Potter's time and attention to the exclusion of nearly everything else, and are accounted as some {{of the reasons for the}} author's declining artistry and her {{lack of interest in}} producing children's books.|$|E
5|$|When the Civil War began, Tubman {{worked for}} the Union Army, first as a cook and nurse, and then as an armed scout and spy. The first woman to lead an armed {{expedition}} in the war, she guided the raid at Combahee Ferry, which liberated more than 700 slaves. After the war, she retired to the family home on property she had purchased in 1859 in Auburn, New York, where she cared for her <b>aging</b> <b>parents.</b> She {{was active in the}} women's suffrage movement until illness overtook her and she had to be admitted to a home for elderly African Americans that she had helped to establish years earlier. After she died in 1913, she became an icon of American courage and freedom.|$|E

Adult siblings eventually expect the loss of <b>aging</b> <b>parents,</b> the only {{other people who have}} been an integral part of their lives since birth, but they do not expect to lose their siblings early; as a result, when a sibling dies, the surviving sibling may experience a longer period of shock and disbelief.|$|E
25|$|Maud {{lived in}} Fayetteville, New York, with her <b>aging</b> <b>parents</b> until she married Frank in 1882, sacrificing her college {{education}} at Cornell University. At {{the onset of}} their marriage, she accompanied her husband's acting troupe throughout the United States. After she became pregnant, Maud and Frank settled down in a rented house, where {{she gave birth to}} Frank Joslyn in 1883. Complications arising from giving birth to her second son Robert Stanton in 1886 caused Maud to become afflicted with peritonitis. Ill for two years, she found solace in visiting her mother and siblings. In 1889 and 1891, she gave birth to Harry Neal and Kenneth Gage, respectively.|$|E
25|$|In 1905, McKenzie {{accepted}} {{appointment as}} Assistant Professor of Economics and Sociology at the Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. He also volunteered with community {{and social service}} organizations in Columbus, including serving as President of the Godman Guild, a settlement house, and organized a successful effort to consolidate Columbus's recreation and playground recreation programming. In 1911, McKenzie offered position as Secretary of the National Playground Association, now the National Recreation and Park Association, at twice his current salary. But obligation to his <b>aging</b> <b>parents</b> precluded his accepting the position. McKenzie continued to focus on his work with Indians, often bringing prominent Indians to lecture in his classes. McKenzie successfully organized the first event of the Society of American Indians. McKenzie enlisted {{the support of the}} City of Columbus, Ohio, Ohio State University and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and planned a symbolic event with national press coverage.|$|E

The child’s race/ethnicity and insurance was supplied by clinical staff along with the following baseline clinical information: diagnosis, respiratory support status, and physician-rated clinical severity (1  = least severe, 10  = most severe), the latter adapted from a validated single item severity measure from the National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs that reflects judgment about likelihood of clinical complications [27].|$|R

25|$|Historically, {{honor is}} a quality {{ascribed}} {{to an individual}} in two ways: either by obtaining it through his or her birth into an honorable family or being assigned as honorable by powerful people who hold higher status in the society. An individual's parental lineage, is the traditional source {{for his or her}} honor. Because honor is passed through paternal lineage in most patrilineal cultures, these societies historically considered having sons as a source of pride and honor. For example, in the Moroccan culture, it is still a preference among women to have sons instead of daughters. Morocco is a typical patrilineal society in which the son has a more important function for the family such as the son supports his parents once they have aged compared to the daughter who will marry into a different group becoming a loss to the family. In such societies men also hold more sexual rights compared to women besides the supportive role men obtain from caring for their <b>aging</b> <b>parents.</b> Females in these societies are perceived as threats to family honor.|$|E

[...] "Ron & Tammy: Part Two" [...] featured the last of several guest performances of Jama Williamson as Wendy, who revealed she was returning to her home country of Canada {{to care for her}} <b>aging</b> <b>parents.</b> Pawnee Police Chief Trumple was portrayed by Eric Pierpoint, who has played several police officers throughout his career, including an alien police officer in the science fiction series Alien Nation and a police chief in the superhero drama series The Cape.|$|E

500|$|Potter {{produced}} two books per annum for Warne, but by 1910 she was juggling {{the demands of}} <b>aging</b> <b>parents</b> {{with the business of}} operating Hill Top, and her literary and artistic productivity began to decline. The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse was the only book Potter published in 1910. She wrote a friend on New Year's Day 1911: [...] "I did not succeed in finishing more than one book last year ... I find it very difficult lately to get the drawings done. I {{do not seem to be}} able to go into the country for a long enough time to do a sufficient amount of sketching and when I was at Bowness last summer I spent most of my time upon the road going backwards & forwards to the farm [...] which was amusing, but not satisfactory for work." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the best}} efforts of the slaveholders, Tubman was never captured, and neither were the fugitives she guided. Years later, she told an audience: [...] "I was {{conductor}} of the Underground Railroad for eight years, and I can say what most conductors can't say – I never ran my train off the track and I never lost a passenger." [...] One of her last missions into Maryland was to retrieve her <b>aging</b> <b>parents.</b> Her father, Ben, had purchased Rit, her mother, in 1855 from Eliza Brodess for 20 dollars. But even when they were both free, the area became hostile to their presence. Two years later, Tubman received word that her father had harbored a group of eight escaped slaves, and was at risk of arrest. She traveled to the Eastern Shore and led them north to St. Catharines, Ontario, where a community of former slaves (including Tubman's brothers, other relatives, and many friends) had gathered.|$|E
500|$|Following her {{acquisition}} of Hill Top Farm in 1905 in Lancashire (now Cumbria), Potter began her most creative and productive {{years as a}} children's author and illustrator. By {{the end of the}} decade, however, she had grown weary of writing for children. Her eyesight was failing, and the demands of operating her farm and caring for her <b>aging</b> <b>parents</b> limited the amount of time and attention she could allocate to the production of books. In 1912 however, she brought Peter Rabbit and his kin together for one last time in The Tale of Mr. Tod. She thought her editors too cautious and too concerned about offending the public, and knew she was capable of creating more complex characters and plots. In Mr. Tod she offered her fans two villainous characters [...] Mr. Tod and Tommy Brock, a fox and a badger. The Tale of Mr. Tod and the book to follow in 1913, The Tale of Pigling Bland, were her last completely original works. Her marriage to William Heelis in October 1913 effectively put an end to her career as a children's author and illustrator, but she continued to produce sporadically over the following years at the demand of fans and publisher, though relying upon decades-old ideas and sketches rather than new concepts and illustrations.|$|E

Often the good but not very clever hero is duped by a scheming villain, who has eyes on the damsel in distress until fate intervenes at the end to ensure the triumph of good over evil. [...] Two central features were the coup de théàtre, or reversal of fortune, and the claptrap: a back-to-the-wall oration by the hero which forces the audience to applaud.|$|R
500|$|Bans called Waller {{getting a}} new penis the most {{emotional}} scene she had to write, adding: [...] "I loved this story because I hate the idea that once you're old, your life is over. I hate when people treat their <b>aging</b> <b>parents</b> like old furniture {{they want to get}} rid of but have to find a place for so they stick 'em in the corner and forget about them." [...] Bans also commented on Heigl's character's storyline, writing: [...] "Poor Izzie. The girl's living with cancer, lost her best friend, impulsively got married and dragged her husband away to live in the woods. That takes a lot out of a person. I need to seriously recover on the couch for an hour after I go to the grocery store – I can't imagine the emotional and physical fatigue Izzie must be feeling right now. I think by the end of this episode, after Owen tells her that channeling her experience as a patient at Seattle Grace is undermining her strength as a doctor at Seattle Grace – she's wondering if she made a mistake. She's wondering if Alex and Derek and now Owen might be right – that she came back to work too soon. That she's not emotionally ready to be cutting into people yet. Because I think every doctor wants to believe all their terminal patients can be Izzie – but the odds tell another story." ...|$|E
