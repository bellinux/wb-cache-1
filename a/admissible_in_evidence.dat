25|$|Sometimes {{during the}} {{testimony}} of a witness, the witness may be questioned about statements he previously made outside court on an earlier occasion, to demonstrate either {{that he has been}} consistent or inconsistent in his account of events. The Act did not change the circumstances in which such statements could become <b>admissible</b> <b>in</b> <b>evidence</b> (which are still prescribed in the Criminal Procedure Act 1865), but it did change the evidential effect of such statements once admitted. Formerly, such statements were not evidence of the facts stated in them (unless the witness agreed with them in court): they only proved that the witness had kept his story straight or had changed his story, and so were only evidence of his credibility (or lack of it) as a witness. They were not hearsay. Under the 2003 Act, however, such statements are now themselves evidence of any facts stated in them, not just of credibility, and so are now hearsay.|$|E
500|$|Provisions {{exist in}} the ISA {{to make it easier}} to admit {{statements}} made by people charged with offences under the Act or certain offences under other laws specified in the Second Schedule to the Act. A statement is <b>admissible</b> <b>in</b> <b>evidence</b> in a trial and, if the person who made the statement chooses to testify during a trial, it may be used in cross-examination and to impeach his or her credit, [...] "whether the statement amounts to a confession or not or is oral or in writing, made at any time, whether before or after that person is charged and whether in the course of a police investigation or not and whether or not wholly or partly in answer to questions, by that person to or in the hearing of any police officer of or above the rank of sergeant and whether or not interpreted to him by any other police officer or any other person concerned, or not, in the arrest". This is subject to two limitations: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Court {{found in}} Rhode Island v. Innis, , that a [...] "spontaneous" [...] {{statement}} {{made by a}} defendant while in custody, even though the defendant has not been given the Miranda warnings or has invoked the right to counsel and a lawyer is not yet present, is <b>admissible</b> <b>in</b> <b>evidence,</b> {{as long as the}} statement was not given in response to police questioning or other conduct by the police likely to produce an incriminating response.|$|E
50|$|A U.S. District Court {{accepted}} repressed memories as <b>admissible</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> {{a specific}} case. Dalenberg {{argues that the}} evidence shows that recovered memory cases {{should be allowed to}} be prosecuted in court.|$|R
50|$|Audio {{forensics}} is {{the field}} of forensic science relating to the acquisition, analysis, and evaluation of sound recordings that may ultimately be presented as <b>admissible</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> {{a court of law}} or some other official venue.|$|R
50|$|A learned treatise, {{in the law}} of evidence, is a {{text that}} is {{sufficiently}} authoritative in its field to be <b>admissible</b> as <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> a court {{in support of the}} contentions made therein.|$|R
2500|$|The Court {{found in}} New York v. Quarles, , {{that there is}} also a [...] "public safety" [...] {{exception}} to the requirement that Miranda warnings be given before questioning: for example, if the defendant is in possession of information regarding the location of an unattended gun or there are other similar exigent circumstances which require protection of the public, the defendant may be questioned without warning and his responses, though incriminating, will be <b>admissible</b> <b>in</b> <b>evidence.</b> In 2009, the California Supreme Court upheld the conviction of Richard Allen Davis, finding that the public safety exception applied despite the fact that 64 days had passed from the disappearance of the girl later found to be murdered.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1970s and 1980s, Khan {{became known}} as a socialite and sported a playboy image due to his [...] "non-stop partying" [...] at London nightclubs such as Annabel's and Tramp, though {{he claims to have}} hated English pubs and never drank alcohol. He also gained notoriety in London gossip columns for romancing young debutantes such as Susannah Constantine, Lady Liza Campbell and the artist Emma Sergeant. One of these ex-girlfriends, the British heiress Sita White, {{daughter}} of Gordon White, Baron White of Hull, became the mother of his alleged lovechild daughter, Tyrian Jade White. A judge in the US ruled him to be the father of Tyrian, but Khan has denied paternity publicly. Later in 2007, Election Commission of Pakistan ruled in favour of Khan and dismissed the ex parte judgment of the US court, on grounds that it was neither <b>admissible</b> <b>in</b> <b>evidence</b> before any court or tribunal in Pakistan nor executable against him. About his lifestyle as a bachelor, he has often said that, [...] "I never claim to have led an angelic life." ...|$|E
5000|$|Garda opinion {{evidence}} {{as to the}} existence of criminal gangs will be <b>admissible</b> <b>in</b> <b>evidence.</b>|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, even in common-law systems, the {{hearsay rule}} only applies to actual trials. Hearsay is <b>admissible</b> as <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> many other {{judicial}} proceedings, such as grand jury deliberations, probation hearings, parole revocation hearings, and proceedings before administrative bodies.|$|R
50|$|The {{court case}} started in December 2013; {{it was decided}} that the phone taps were <b>admissible</b> <b>evidence.</b> <b>In</b> 2015, {{prosecutor}} dropped several charges, and accepted that there was no evidence to prove a system of organized doping within the Lampre team. The judge decided to clear all involved cyclists from the Lampre team, including Ballan whose suspension was cleared.|$|R
25|$|Some {{statements}} {{are defined as}} hearsay, but may nevertheless be <b>admissible</b> as <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> court. These statements relate to exceptions to the general rule on hearsay. Some (but not all) exceptions to the hearsay rule apply only when the declarant is unavailable for testimony at the trial or hearing.|$|R
50|$|The {{court held}} that if one of two persons, accused of having {{together}} committed the crime of murder, makes a voluntary confession {{in the presence of}} the other, without threat or coercion, the confession is <b>admissible</b> <b>in</b> <b>evidence</b> against both. However, declarations of one accomplice after the killing made in the absence of the other implicating the guilt of both are <b>admissible</b> <b>in</b> <b>evidence</b> only against the one making the declarations, not against the other.|$|E
50|$|The rules did {{not alter}} the law on {{admissibility}} of evidence, but became a code of best practice: {{it was assumed that}} statements given by a suspect in accordance with the Rules would be <b>admissible</b> <b>in</b> <b>evidence.</b>|$|E
50|$|Examinations are {{conducted}} in private. Witnesses at examinations {{are able to}} claim protection so that the answers, documents or things they provide are not <b>admissible</b> <b>in</b> <b>evidence</b> against them in a criminal proceeding or a proceeding for {{the imposition of a}} penalty except in limited circumstances.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Admissible</b> <b>evidence,</b> <b>in</b> a {{court of}} law, is any testimonial, documentary, or {{tangible}} evidence that may be introduced to a factfinder—usually a judge or jury—to establish or to bolster a point put forth by {{a party to the}} proceeding. For evidence to be admissible, it must be relevant, without being unfairly prejudicial, and it must have some indicia of reliability. The general rule <b>in</b> <b>evidence</b> is that all relevant evidence is admissible and all irrelevant evidence is inadmissible.|$|R
5000|$|No {{statement}} that is verified {{as having been}} obtained through torture shall be <b>admissible</b> as <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> a legal proceeding, except in a legal action taken against a person or persons accused of having elicited it through acts of torture, and only {{as evidence that the}} accused obtained such statement by such means.|$|R
5000|$|Evidence of {{the results}} of subject tests using an {{approved}} instrument are <b>admissible</b> <b>in</b> court as <b>evidence</b> that the accused committed the offence of driving over [...]08. The Criminal Code provides that if several conditions are met concerning the way the test was taken, the results of the test are generally conclusive proof of the blood alcohol concentration at the time of driving. This presumption can only be rebutted by evidence that the device and the test were inaccurate in some way, and that the blood alcohol content was in fact likely lower than [...]08.|$|R
50|$|Testing {{for alcohol}} {{concentration}} {{is performed using}} three methods - blood, breath, or urine. For law enforcement purposes, breath is the preferred method, since results are available almost instantaneously. Drug testing screens are typically performed in scientific laboratories so that {{the results will be}} <b>admissible</b> <b>in</b> <b>evidence</b> at trial.|$|E
50|$|A public {{instrument}} is generally <b>admissible</b> <b>in</b> <b>evidence</b> without {{the necessity of}} preliminary proof of its authenticity and due execution. In other words, {{public instrument}}s are self-authenticating documentary evidence. A presumption of regularity and validity attaches to public instruments; for the instrument to be rebutted, it must be proven in court to contain a willful material error.|$|E
50|$|Because {{there are}} still {{existing}} alive concubines married before the Marriage Reform Ordinance (Cap.178), and their rights (of inheritance, and the inheritance rights of their sons and daughters) are respected by the Hong Kong legal system (even after the 1997 handover), the Great Qing Legal Code is still <b>admissible</b> <b>in</b> <b>evidence</b> when handling legal cases with history dated back before 1971.|$|E
50|$|As an {{explicitly}} spiritual movement, anthroposophy {{has sometimes}} been called a religious philosophy. In 2005, a California federal court ruled that a group alleging that anthroposophy is a religion for Establishment Clause purposes did not provide any legally <b>admissible</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> support of this view; the case is under appeal. In 2000, a French court ruled that a government minister's description of anthroposophy as a cult was defamatory.|$|R
5000|$|R v Starr 2000 2 S.C.R. 144 is {{a leading}} Supreme Court of Canada {{decision}} that re-evaluated several principles of <b>evidence.</b> <b>In</b> particular, they held that the [...] "principled approach" [...] hearsay evidence under R v Khan and R v Smith (1992) can be equally used to exclude otherwise <b>admissible</b> hearsay <b>evidence.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the Court examined the judge's charge to the jury on the standard of beyond a reasonable doubt.|$|R
40|$|The North Carolina Supreme Court {{expressly}} overruled State v. Steele and State v. Milano by {{its decision}} in State v. Grier. The Court held that polygraph results {{are no longer}} <b>admissible</b> as <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> civil or criminal trials in North Carolina notwithstanding a prior stipulation by the parties. This note will examine the Court 2 ̆ 7 s rationale {{and the implications of}} its decision...|$|R
5000|$|The suspect's unadvised {{statement}} was therefore <b>admissible</b> <b>in</b> <b>evidence</b> because [...] "in a kaleidoscopic situation {{such as the}} one confronting these officers, where spontaneity rather than adherence to a police manual is necessarily the order of the day, the application of the exception we recognize today should not be made to depend on post hoc findings at a suppression hearing concerning the subjective motivation of the police officer".|$|E
50|$|For drivers {{suspected}} of drug-impaired driving, drug testing screens are typically performed in scientific laboratories {{so that the}} results will be <b>admissible</b> <b>in</b> <b>evidence</b> at trial. Due to the overwhelming number of impairing substances that are not alcohol, drugs are classified into different categories for detection purposes. Drug impaired drivers still show impairment during the battery of standardized field sobriety tests, but there are additional tests to help detect drug impaired driving.|$|E
5000|$|The Court {{found in}} Rhode Island v. Innis, , that a [...] "spontaneous" [...] {{statement}} {{made by a}} defendant while in custody, even though the defendant has not been given the Miranda warnings or has invoked the right to counsel and a lawyer is not yet present, is <b>admissible</b> <b>in</b> <b>evidence,</b> {{as long as the}} statement was not given in response to police questioning or other conduct by the police likely to produce an incriminating response.|$|E
50|$|A deathbed {{confession}} can be <b>admissible</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> court {{under the}} right circumstances. If someone confesses knowledge of a crime and then dies or their condition worsens, {{the law does not}} consider the statement to be hearsay and {{can be used in a}} criminal trial. A deathbed confession can be a valuable piece of <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> a case that may not have much physical evidence. Even criminal confessions that have been secret for years can still be of use, such as in a murder case, because there is no statute of limitations on murder cases.|$|R
40|$|While {{log data}} are being {{increasingly}} used as digital <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> court, {{the extent to}} which existing secure logging protocols used to collect log data fulfill the legal requirements for admissible evidence remain largely unclear. This paper elucidates a subset of the necessary secure requirements for digital evidence and extensively surveys {{the state of the art}} secure logging protocols, thereby demonstrating that none of the current protocols completely fulfills the elucidated requirements for <b>admissible</b> <b>evidence.</b> <b>In</b> analyzing the shortcoming of logging protocols, the paper also elaborates on the related research challenges...|$|R
5000|$|By a {{unanimous}} {{decision in the}} case of Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. 383 (1914), the Supreme Court adopted the [...] "exclusionary rule". This rule declared that, <b>in</b> most circumstances, <b>evidence</b> obtained through an illegal search and seizure could not be used as <b>admissible</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> a criminal trial. (This decision adopted the rule only on the federal level. It was not until Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961), that the exclusionary rule was held to be binding on the states through the doctrine of selective incorporation.) ...|$|R
5000|$|The pre-trial {{operation}} of the privilege against self-incrimination was further buttressed by the decision in Ibrahim v R 1914 AC 599 that an admission or confession made by the accused to the police would only be <b>admissible</b> <b>in</b> <b>evidence</b> if the prosecution could establish {{that it had been}} voluntary. An admission or confession is only voluntary if made in the exercise of a free choice about whether to speak or remain silent: ...|$|E
5000|$|A person {{served with}} a summons or a notice to produce {{documents}} must comply with that requirement, or face prosecution for an offence. The penalty for conviction upon such an offence is a fine of [...] or six months imprisonment. However, the Act excuses the penalty for failing to attend if a reasonable excuse can be provided (self-incrimination is not a reasonable excuse, however, as statements or documents tended by witnesses are not <b>admissible</b> <b>in</b> <b>evidence</b> against the witness).|$|E
50|$|Little {{is known}} about the details of the dispute in this case beyond the fact that at least two parties appear to have claimed {{ownership}} of some parcel of land located in the Pennsylvania Colony, and one claim appears to have been based on inheritance from a deceased prior owner. The issue resolved by the first decision was whether a title deed to land in the Pennsylvania Colony, executed in England, registered (“inrolled”) in the King’s Bench, and notarized (“proved”) before the Lord Mayor of the City of London, could be admitted as evidence in a trial in the Pennsylvania territorial court regarding disputed land. The Pennsylvania colonial court held that such a deed was <b>admissible</b> <b>in</b> <b>evidence.</b>|$|E
50|$|On August 10, 2012 the {{government}} filed a pleading describing an ex parte motion seeking {{permission of the}} military commission to destroy a military black site where the accused were imprisoned.In response, the defense filed dozens of discovery requests and motions to compel. August 12, 2013 the military commission ruled that information related to the black site would be <b>admissible</b> as <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> court, and protected under the law as such.|$|R
50|$|This {{procedure}} is followed in both {{civil and criminal}} causes. The subsequent statement is generally inadmissible as <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> the trial, but it allows the procurator fiscal, advocate or solicitor in Scotland {{to appear before the}} Courts of Scotland knowing what evidence each witness is likely to present. Following the judgement of the Appeal Court in Beurskens v HM Advocate 2014 HCJAC 99 it is possible for a precognition to be considered as a statement, and thus be <b>admissible</b> as <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> court.|$|R
40|$|Records {{management}} practices are mandatory in many {{business and government}} operations. Records management is a mature discipline with extensive body of knowledge, professional associations and clearly defined Australian and international standards. Records systems encompass the hardware, software and people necessary for operation and include records generated by and for the system. The Australian legal system has clearly defined standards for <b>admissible</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> the <b>Evidence</b> Act. Relevant records may require substantial preparation for submission and yet be inadmissible in legal proceedings. The records and system may be challenged in both theoretical and practical senses and appropriate practices and associated records are needed. These records may be expensive to acquire, process and store in suitable format and retaining the original data may be necessary. Applying records from a system to problems outside of the initial system requirements and design may expose the system to attack by showing that it fails to meet good practice. Further, validation of the system may demand suitable records from every stage of the system lifecycle including theoretical and operational basis...|$|R
