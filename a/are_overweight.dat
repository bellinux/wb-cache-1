5|$|Gout {{is due to}} {{elevated}} levels of uric acid in the blood. This occurs due {{to a combination of}} diet and genetic factors. At high levels, uric acid crystallizes and the crystals deposit in joints, tendons and surrounding tissues, resulting in an attack of gout. Gout occurs more commonly in those who eat a lot of meat, drink a lot of beer, or <b>are</b> <b>overweight.</b> Diagnosis of gout may be confirmed by seeing the crystals in joint fluid or tophus. Blood uric acid levels may be normal during an attack.|$|E

5|$|Labradors like to eat, {{and without}} proper {{exercise}} can become obese. Laziness is {{a contribution to}} this. Obesity is a serious condition and can be considered the number one nutritional problem with dogs. A study shows that at least 25% of dogs in the United States <b>are</b> <b>overweight.</b> Therefore, Labradors must be properly exercised and stimulated. A healthy Labrador can do swimming wind sprints for two hours, and should keep a very slight hourglass waist and be fit and light, rather than fat or heavy-set. Obesity can exacerbate conditions such as hip dysplasia and joint problems, {{and can lead to}} secondary diseases, including diabetes. Osteoarthritis is very common in older, especially overweight, Labradors. A 14-year study covering 48 dogs by food manufacturer Purina showed that Labradors fed to maintain a lean body shape outlived those fed freely by around two years, emphasising the importance of not over-feeding. Labradors should be walked twice a day for at least half an hour.|$|E

25|$|Diabetes and prediabetes are {{strongly}} linked to obesity and overweight.

Obese individuals are at twice the risk of dying from any cause than normal-weight individuals. The prevalence of obesity and overweight have risen to epidemic proportions in the United States, where 67% of adults <b>are</b> <b>overweight</b> and, of these, approximately half are obese.|$|E

25|$|Intentional {{weight loss}} {{is the loss}} of total body mass as a result of efforts to improve fitness and health, or to change {{appearance}} through slimming.

It could reduce pain and increase movement in people with osteoarthritis of the knee. Weight loss can lead to a reduction in hypertension (high blood pressure), however whether this reduces hypertension-related harm is unclear.|$|E

25|$|Dieting is the {{practice}} of eating food in a regulated and supervised fashion to decrease, maintain, or increase body weight.

Some people follow a diet to gain weight (usually {{in the form of}} muscle). Diets {{can also be used to}} maintain a stable body weight and improve health.

25|$|The Institute of Medicine {{recommends}} {{an overall}} pregnancy weight gain {{for those of}} normal weight (body mass index of 18.5–24.9), of 11.3–15.9kg (25–35 pounds) having a singleton pregnancy. Women who are underweight (BMI of less than 18.5), should gain between 12.7–18kg (28–40lbs), while those who <b>are</b> <b>overweight</b> (BMI of 25–29.9) are advised to gain between 6.8–11.3kg (15–25lbs) {{and those who are}} obese (BMI>30) should gain between 5–9kg (11–20lbs). These values reference the expectations for a term pregnancy. The Friedmann-Balayla Model provides a more accurate calculation of weight gain by gestational age.|$|E
