5|$|Quintel {{initially}} {{worked as}} a writer and staff director for the Cartoon Network series Camp Lazlo and The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack before he was offered to produce a short for the network's showcase project The Cartoonstitute. Quintel developed the Regular Show pilot for the project, utilizing characters from his California Institute of the Arts student films The Naïve Man from Lolliland (2005) and 2 in the <b>AM</b> <b>PM</b> (2006). While The Cartoonstitute was ultimately scrapped, Cartoon Network executives approved the production of a Regular Show series. Its first two seasons were ratings successes, with Nielsen Media Research ranking the series at number one in its time period amongst its primary demographic. As of May 2013, the program averages approximately 2 to 2.5 million viewers each week.|$|E

In May 2006, Nicktoons announced that Quintel {{would be one of}} six judges at the 3rd Annual Nicktoons Network Animation Festival. In 2007, Quintel entered his short film, 2 in the <b>AM</b> <b>PM,</b> in the 30th annual Spike & Mike's Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation. In 2 in the <b>AM</b> <b>PM,</b> two slackers are left alone to run a convenience store/gas station on Halloween night, where candy filled with drugs creates a mini-nightmare. Quintel later used some of these 2 in the <b>AM</b> <b>PM</b> characters in Regular Show.|$|E

Quintel pitched Regular Show for Cartoon Network's Cartoonstitute project, in which the network allowed young artists to create pilots with no notes, which would possibly be optioned as shows. The project was green-lit and it premiered on September 6, 2010.|$|E

We study {{the structure of}} NI rings relating to strongly prime ideals and show that minimal strongly prime ideals can be lifted in NI rings. A ring is called (respectively weakly) pm if every (respectively strongly) prime ideal is contained in a unique maximal ideal in it. For a 2 -primal ring R Sun proved that R <b>is</b> <b>pm</b> {{if and only if}} Max(R) is a retract of Spec(R) if and only if Spec(R) is normal. In the present note we prove for an NI ring R that R <b>is</b> weakly <b>pm</b> if and only if Max(R) is a retract of SSpec(R) if and only if SSpec(R) is normal, where SSpec(R) is the space of strongly prime ideals of R. We also prove that R <b>is</b> weakly <b>pm</b> if and only if R <b>is</b> <b>pm</b> when R <b>is</b> a symmetric ring. We lastly consider several kinds of extensions of NI rings...|$|R
