5|$|Amino acids {{are made}} into {{proteins}} by being joined {{together in a}} chain of peptide bonds. Each different protein has a unique sequence of amino acid residues: this is its primary structure. Just as {{the letters of the}} alphabet can be combined to form an almost endless variety of words, amino acids can be linked in varying sequences to form a huge variety of proteins. Proteins are made from amino acids that have been activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This <b>aminoacyl-tRNA</b> precursor is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. This <b>aminoacyl-tRNA</b> is then a substrate for the ribosome, which joins the amino acid onto the elongating protein chain, using the sequence information in a messenger RNA.|$|E
5|$|As {{both the}} amine and {{carboxylic}} acid groups of amino acids can {{react to form}} amide bonds, one amino acid molecule can react with another and become joined through an amide linkage. This polymerization of amino acids is what creates proteins. This condensation reaction yields the newly formed peptide bond and a molecule of water. In cells, this reaction does not occur directly; instead, the amino acid is first activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This <b>aminoacyl-tRNA</b> is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. This <b>aminoacyl-tRNA</b> is then a substrate for the ribosome, which catalyzes the attack of the amino group of the elongating protein chain on the ester bond. As {{a result of this}} mechanism, all proteins made by ribosomes are synthesized starting at their N-terminus and moving toward their C-terminus.|$|E
5|$|Stereochemical {{affinity}}: {{the genetic}} code {{is a result of}} a high affinity between each amino acid and its codon or anti-codon; the latter option implies that pre-tRNA molecules matched their corresponding amino acids by this affinity. Later during evolution, this matching was gradually replaced with matching by <b>aminoacyl-tRNA</b> synthetases.|$|E

40|$|In translation, {{elongation}} factor Tu (EF-Tu) molecules deliver <b>aminoacyl-tRNAs</b> to the mRNA-programmed ribosome. The GTPase activity of EF-Tu is triggered by ribosome-induced conformational {{changes of the}} factor that play {{a pivotal role in}} the selection of the cognate <b>aminoacyl-tRNAs.</b> We present a 6. 7 -Å cryo-electron microscopy map of the aminoacyl-tRNA·EF-Tu·GDP·kirromycin-bound Escherichia coli ribosome, together with an atomic model of the complex obtained through molecular dynamics flexible fitting. The model reveals the conformational changes in the conserved GTPase switch regions of EF-Tu that trigger hydrolysis of GTP, along with key interactions, including those between the sarcin-ricin loop and the P loop of EF-Tu, and between the effector loop of EF-Tu and a conserved region of the 16 S rRNA. Our data suggest that GTP hydrolysis on EF-Tu is controlled through a hydrophobic gate mechanism...|$|R
5|$|The {{genetic code}} {{is a key}} part of the story of life. The main {{hypothesis}} for life's origin is the RNA world hypothesis. Any model for the emergence of genetic code is intimately related to a model of the transfer from ribozymes (RNA enzymes) to proteins as the principal enzymes in cells. In line with the RNA world hypothesis, transfer RNA molecules appear to have evolved before modern <b>aminoacyl-tRNA</b> synthetases, so the latter cannot be part of the explanation of its patterns.|$|E
25|$|An aminoacyl tRNA {{synthetase}} (aaRS) is {{an enzyme}} that attaches the appropriate amino acid onto its tRNA. It does so by catalyzing the esterification {{of a specific}} cognate amino acid or its precursor to one of all its compatible cognate tRNAs to form an <b>aminoacyl-tRNA.</b> In humans, the 21 different types of aa-tRNA are made by the 21 different <b>aminoacyl-tRNA</b> synthetases, one for each amino acid of the genetic code.|$|E

40|$|International audienceCyclodipeptides {{and their}} {{derivatives}} {{belong to the}} diketopiperazine (DKP) family, which is comprised of {{a broad array of}} natural products that exhibit useful biological properties. In the few known DKP biosynthetic pathways, nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are involved in the synthesis of cyclodipeptides that constitute the DKP scaffold, except in the albonoursin (1) pathway. Albonoursin, or cyclo(alpha,beta-dehydroPhe-alpha,beta-dehydroLeu), is an antibacterial DKP produced by Streptomyces noursei. In this pathway, the formation of the cyclo(Phe-Leu) (2) intermediate is catalyzed by AlbC, a small protein unrelated to NRPSs. We demonstrated that AlbC uses <b>aminoacyl-tRNAs</b> as substrates to catalyze the formation of the DKP peptide bonds. Moreover, several other bacterial proteins, presenting moderate similarity to AlbC, also use <b>aminoacyl-tRNAs</b> to synthesize various cyclodipeptides. Therefore, AlbC and these related proteins belong to a newly defined family of enzymes that we have named cyclodipeptide synthases (CDPSs) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{existence}} of <b>aminoacyl-tRNAs</b> was predicted {{during the late}} 50 s as molecules that transfer specific amino acids for protein synthesis. Today we know that, in addition to protein synthesis, these molecules can also participate in several other cellular functions. One of these <b>aminoacyl-tRNAs,</b> glutamyl-tRNA, can participate {{in at least three}} functions in bacteria: biosynthesis of glutaminyl-tRNA, tetrapyrroles and proteins. In this article we discuss how bacterial cells manage to distribute glutamyl-tRNA among all these functions. Proteins involved in each pathway recognize different features of the tRNA which allows them to use only the correct glutamyl-tRNA species. Also, the formation of macro-molecular complexes allows the utilization of each of these species by the correct proteins. This compart-mentalization is critical for bacterial fitness as it prevents the incorporation of intermediates in the incor-rect pathway. (doi: 10. 5562 /cca 1830...|$|R
25|$|Some synthetases also mediate a editing {{reaction}} to ensure high fidelity of tRNA charging. If the incorrect tRNA is added (aka. the tRNA {{is found to}} be improperly charged), the <b>aminoacyl-tRNA</b> bond is hydrolyzed. This can happen when two amino acids have different properties even if they have similar shapes—as is the case with Valine and Threonine.|$|E
25|$|The {{ribosome}} {{has three}} sites for tRNA to bind. They are the aminoacyl site (abbreviated A), the peptidyl site (abbreviated P) and the exit site (abbreviated E). With {{respect to the}} mRNA, the three sites are oriented 5’ to 3’ E-P-A, because ribosomes move toward the 3' end of mRNA. The A site binds the incoming tRNA with the complementary codon on the mRNA. The P site holds the tRNA with the growing polypeptide chain. The E site holds the tRNA without its amino acid. When an <b>aminoacyl-tRNA</b> initially binds to its corresponding codon on the mRNA, {{it is in the}} A site. Then, a peptide bond forms between the amino acid of the tRNA in the A site and the amino acid of the charged tRNA in the P site. The growing polypeptide chain is transferred to the tRNA in the A site. Translocation occurs, moving the tRNA in the P site, now without an amino acid, to the E site; the tRNA that was in the A site, now charged with the polypeptide chain, is moved to the P site. The tRNA in the E site leaves and another <b>aminoacyl-tRNA</b> enters the A site to repeat the process.|$|E
25|$|Tetracycline {{inhibits}} {{protein synthesis}} by blocking the attachment of charged <b>aminoacyl-tRNA</b> to the A {{site on the}} ribosome. Tetracycline binds to the 30S subunit of microbial ribosomes. Thus, it prevents introduction of new amino acids to the nascent peptide chain. The action is usually inhibitory and reversible upon withdrawal of the drug. Mammalian cells are less vulnerable {{to the effect of}} tetracyclines, despite the fact that tetracycline binds to the small ribosomal subunit of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (30S and 40S, respectively). This is because bacteria actively pump tetracycline into their cytoplasm, even against a concentration gradient, whereas mammalian cells do not. This accounts for the relatively small off-site effect of tetracycline on human cells.|$|E
40|$|We provide {{evidence}} that Scyl 1 is also a cytoplasmic component of the nuclear aminoacylation-dependent tRNA export pathway. Scyl 1, like the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cex 1 p, may collect <b>aminoacyl-tRNAs</b> from the nuclear tRNA export receptors at the cytoplasmic side of the NPC and channel them to eEF- 1 A for use in protein synthesis...|$|R
5000|$|A {{release factor}} is a protein {{that allows for}} the {{termination}} of translation by recognizing the termination codon or stop codon in an mRNA sequence.

50|$|Omacetaxine is {{a protein}} {{translation}} inhibitor. It inhibits protein translation by preventing the initial elongation step of protein synthesis. It {{interacts with the}} ribosomal A-site and prevents the correct positioning of amino acid side chains of incoming <b>aminoacyl-tRNAs.</b> Omacetaxine acts only on the initial step of protein translation and does not inhibit protein synthesis from mRNAs that have already commenced translation.|$|R
25|$|Versteeg et al. also {{concluded}} that, {{contrary to}} Lerchers analysis, the transcription levels of many genes in RIDGEs (for example a cluster on chromosome 9) can vary strongly between different tissues. Lee et al. (2003) analyzed {{the trend of}} gene clustering between different species. They compared Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Homo sapiens, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana and Drosophila melanogaster, and found a degree of clustering, as fraction of genes in loose clusters, of respectively (37%), (50%), (74%), (52%) and (68%). They concluded that pathways of which the genes are clusters across many species are rare. They found seven universally clustered pathways: glycolysis, <b>aminoacyl-tRNA</b> biosynthesis, ATP synthase, DNA polymerase, hexachlorocyclohexane degradation, cyanoamino acid metabolism, and photosynthesis (ATP synthesis in non plant species). Not surprisingly these are basic cellular pathways.|$|E
25|$|The small ribosomal subunit, {{typically}} {{bound to}} an <b>aminoacyl-tRNA</b> containing the amino acid methionine, binds to an AUG codon on the mRNA and recruits the large ribosomal subunit. The ribosome contains three RNA binding sites, designated A, P and E. The A site binds an aminoacyl-tRNA; the P site binds a peptidyl-tRNA (a tRNA {{bound to the}} peptide being synthesized); and the E site binds a free tRNA before it exits the ribosome. Protein synthesis begins at a start codon AUG near the 5' end of the mRNA. mRNA binds to the P site of the ribosome first.

Mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA separated into 3 peaks on RPC- 5 and the first species was shown to be different than a combination of the other two by molecular size and partial RNase T 1 digestion patterns. Each was coded by a separate gene on mtDNA as shown by partial additivity of hybridization.

40|$|The tritiated trinucleotide UGA {{was used}} in a binding assay to detect {{transfer}} RNAs that recognize this nonsense codon from calf-liver cells. Acylation of transfer RNA with labeled amino acids and determination of codon responses of <b>aminoacyl-tRNAs</b> demonstrate that a species of seryl-tRNA and a species of arginyl-tRNA recognize the codon UGA.

40|$|EF-Tu {{delivers}} <b>aminoacyl-tRNAs</b> to ribosomes in {{the translation}} system. However, unusual truncations {{found in some}} animal mitochondrial tRNAs seem to prevent recognition by a canonical EF-Tu. We showed previously that the chromadorean nematode has two distinct EF-Tus, one of which (EF-Tu 1) binds only to T-armless <b>aminoacyl-tRNAs</b> and the other (EF-Tu 2) binds to D-armless Ser-tRNAs. Neither of the EF-Tus can bind to canonical cloverleaf tRNAs. In this study, by analyzing the translation system of enoplean nematode Trichinella species, we address how EF-Tus and tRNAs have evolved from the canonical structures toward those of the chromadorean translation system. Trichinella mitochondria possess three types of tRNAs: cloverleaf tRNAs, which do not exist in chromadorean nematode mitochondria; T-armless tRNAs; and D-armless tRNAs. We found two mitochondrial EF-Tu species, EF-Tu 1 and EF-Tu 2, in Trichinella britovi. T. britovi EF-Tu 2 could bind to only D-armless Ser-tRNA, as Caenorhabditis elegans EF-Tu 2 does. In contrast {{to the case of}} C. elegans EF-Tu 1, however, T. britovi EF-Tu 1 bound to all three types of tRNA present in Trichinella mitochondria. These results suggest that Trichinella mitochondrial translation system, and particularly the tRNA-binding specificity of EF-Tu 1, could be an intermediate state between the canonical system and the chromadorean nematode mitochondrial system...|$|R
