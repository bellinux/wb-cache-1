5|$|CAM sailings were {{initially}} limited to North American convoys with <b>aircraft</b> <b>maintenance</b> {{performed by the}} Royal Canadian Air Force at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. CAM ships sailed on Gibraltar and Freetown convoys beginning in September, 1941, after an <b>aircraft</b> <b>maintenance</b> unit was established at the RAF base at North Front, Gibraltar. No CAM aircraft were provided during January and February 1942 after it proved impossible to maintain the catapult-mounted aircraft in flying order during the North Atlantic winter. CAM sailings resumed on 6 March 1942 on North Atlantic convoys and in April on the Arctic Russian convoys with an RAF <b>aircraft</b> <b>maintenance</b> unit in Archangelsk.|$|E

As commander of the 8th Aero Squadron, he flew reconnaissance missions {{along the border with}} Mexico during the Mexican Revolution. Poor <b>aircraft</b> <b>maintenance,</b> rough landing strips and bad weather led to the squadron losing 22 of its 24 Airco DH.4 aircraft in just one year.|$|E

5|$|Placing {{the engines}} within the wings had the {{advantage}} of a reduction in the risk of foreign object damage, which could seriously damage jet engines. The low-mounted engines and good placement of service panels also made <b>aircraft</b> <b>maintenance</b> easier to perform. However, the Comet's buried engine configuration increased its structural weight and complexity. Armour had to be placed around the engine cells to contain debris from any serious engine failures; also, placing the engines inside the wing required a more complicated wing structure.|$|E
5|$|HMS Pioneer was a Colossus-class {{aircraft}} carrier {{built for the}} Royal Navy during World War II.

She supported the British attacks on the Japanese Home Islands from mid-June {{until the end of}} the war in August from a base in the Admiralty Islands. The ship and her facilities were used to help repair Hong Kong's infrastructure in late 1945 and she returned to the UK in early 1946. Pioneer was immediately placed in reserve upon her arrival and she was sold in 1954 for scrap.|$|E

A NASA panel, headed by the Chief of the Astronaut Office, Alan Shepard, investigated the crash.
