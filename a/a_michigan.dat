The twenty-four points {{scored in}} the first quarter broke the {{previous}} Gator Bowl record for most points {{in the first quarter}}, which was set in 2005 between West Virginia and Florida State. Denard Robinson finished the season with 4,272 yards of total offense, <b>a</b> <b>Michigan</b> single-season record.

5|$|At {{the time}} of his graduation, he ranked third in career tackles in school history, behind Anderson and Ron Simpkins. He has since been passed by Jarrett Irons and Sam Sword, and he stands fifth with 220 tackles.

Morrison suffered compartmental syndrome in his calf, which necessitated surgical repair to stop internal bleeding, during his 1990 freshman season, for which he earned a medical redshirt season by the NCAA. As a sophomore (redshirt freshman), he sat out four games with a broken leg. In 1993, he missed the first seven games with a broken foot.|$|E

Patrick, who was the 2002 Virginia Independent Schools Division I Player of the Year, had intended to play at Richmond with his father, and instead went to West Virginia when his father moved there. Patrick was a 2008–2009 season graduate assistant coach at University of Michigan.

5|$|Bill Perigo {{took over}} the Michigan {{coaching}} job after having served three seasons as Western Michigan basketball coach. Despite previous success as a conference basketball champion coach at Western and subsequent success as <b>a</b> <b>Michigan</b> High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) champion basketball coach, his Michigan teams endured several mediocre seasons. His best Big Ten records came in 1956–57 and 1958–59 when his teams compiled 8–6 conference records. The latter team was tied for second in the conference and was 15–7 overall (8–6, Big Ten). It also had Perigo's only first-team All-Big Ten athlete in M. C. Burton. Team captain and two-time football consensus All-American Ron Kramer was third-team All-Big Ten in 1957 after being second-team All-Big Ten in both 1955 and 1956.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of time of removal of thiomersal, the CDC and AAP asked doctors to delay the birth dose of {{hepatitis}} B vaccine in children not at risk for hepatitis. This decision, though following the precautionary principle, nevertheless sparked confusion, controversy and some harm. Approximately 10% of hospitals suspended the use of hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns, and one child born to <b>a</b> <b>Michigan</b> mother infected with hepatitis B virus died of it. Similarly, a study found that the number of hospitals who failed to properly vaccinate infants of hepatitis B seropositive mothers rose by over 6 times. This is a potential negative outcome given the high probability that infants who acquire hepatitis B infection at birth will develop the infection in a chronic form and possibly liver cancer.|$|E

The Lake Michigan Circle Tour was signed on maps by 1988. In May 2001, the section of US12 through Saline was designated <b>a</b> <b>Michigan</b> Historic Heritage Route. The segment through Clinton was given the same status in October 2002. On June 9, 2004, the full length of US12 was dedicated as the US12 Heritage Trail.

In 2002, {{the route of}} M-22 from the Benzie–Leelanau county line northward to Northport and then south to Traverse City was designated as part of <b>a</b> <b>Michigan</b> Heritage Route along with M-109 and M-204 as the Leelanau Scenic Heritage Route; this moniker was renamed Pure Michigan Byway {{at the end of}} 2014.

5|$|Michigan's 721 {{yards of}} total offense rank {{as the second}} most in program history, {{trailing}} only the Wolverines' 727-yard effort against Delaware State on October 17, 2009.

It was also the fifth-best total in Big Ten conference history. Tate Forcier set <b>a</b> <b>Michigan</b> single-game completion record of 100%, completing 12 of 12 passes for 110 yards and a touchdown.

5|$|Plans for the {{boulevard}} {{and the construction}} of <b>a</b> <b>Michigan</b> Avenue Bridge were further elaborated upon in Daniel Burnham's 1909 Plan of Chicago. In 1911 a plan was selected that included the widening of Michigan Avenue from Randolph Street to the river, replacing the Rush Street bridge with a new bridge at Michigan Avenue {{and the construction of}} a double-decked boulevard along Pine Street as far as Ohio Street. An ordinance to fund construction was passed in 1913, but was declared void by the Supreme Court of Illinois. A second ordinance was passed in 1914, but legal battles continued until the end of 1916. Construction finally started on April 15, 1918, and the bridge was officially opened in a ceremony on May 14, 1920.|$|E
