5|$|Due to the Bay Area's diverse topography, {{the result}} of the clashing tectonic plates, the region is home to {{numerous}} microclimates that lead to pronounced differences in climate and temperature over short distances. Within the city of San Francisco, natural and artificial topographical features direct the movement of wind <b>and</b> <b>fog,</b> resulting in startlingly varied climates between city blocks. Along the Golden Gate Strait, oceanic wind <b>and</b> <b>fog</b> from the Pacific Ocean are able to penetrate the mountain barriers inland into the Bay Area. During the summer, rising hot air in California's interior valleys creates a low pressure area that draws winds from the North Pacific High through the Golden Gate, which creates the city's characteristic cool winds <b>and</b> <b>fog.</b> The microclimate phenomenon is most pronounced during this time, when fog penetration is at its maximum in areas near the Golden Gate strait, while the South Bay and areas further inland are sunny and dry.|$|E
5|$|Cold fronts may feature narrow {{bands of}} {{thunderstorms}} and severe weather, and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines. Warm fronts are usually preceded by stratiform precipitation <b>and</b> <b>fog.</b> The weather usually clears quickly after a front's passage. Some fronts produce no precipitation and little cloudiness, {{although there is}} invariably a wind shift.|$|E
5|$|Commandos {{on board}} would then {{disembark}} and use demolition charges to destroy nearby dock installations, searchlights and gun emplacements. The destroyer {{would then be}} blown up. At {{the same time the}} RAF would carry out a number of diversionary air raids in the area. Most of them failed because of heavy clouds <b>and</b> <b>fog</b> and very few bombers.|$|E

The film {{was shown in}} the 4DX format, featuring strobe lights, tilting seats, blowing wind <b>and</b> <b>fog</b> and odor effects in selected countries. In Japan, the technology opened its first room at the Korona World theatre in Nagoya, Japan {{with the release of}} the film.|$|E
5|$|Saint Paul has a {{continental}} climate {{typical of the}} Upper Midwestern United States. Winters are frigid and snowy, while summers are warm to hot and humid. On the Köppen climate classification, Saint Paul falls in the hot summer humid continental climate zone (Dfa). The city experiences {{a full range of}} precipitation and related weather events, including snow, sleet, ice, rain, thunderstorms, tornadoes, <b>and</b> <b>fog.</b>|$|E
5|$|The last {{scheduled}} passenger service left Quainton Road in {{the afternoon}} of 30 November 1935. Hundreds of people gathered, {{and a number of}} members of the Oxford University Railway Society travelled from Oxford in an effort to buy the last ticket. Accompanied by firecrackers <b>and</b> <b>fog</b> signals, the train ran the length of the line to Brill, where the passengers posed for a photograph.|$|E

50|$|Relatively mild winters with {{considerable}} variation in snow cover. Heavy rainfalls from October through December. Summers cooled by low clouds <b>and</b> <b>fogs</b> near coasts, considerably brighter and warmer inland.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{slow and}} tedious journey, with many perils from icebergs <b>and</b> <b>fogs,</b> <b>and</b> during that time Captain Williamson had more trouble with Pep Loggermore. As a result, the sailor was put in irons. At Upernivik {{he was allowed to}} go ashore, {{and that was the last}} seen of him.|$|R
5|$|A {{major part}} of modern weather {{forecasting}} is the severe weather alerts and advisories that the national weather services issue in the case that severe or hazardous weather is expected. This is done to protect life and property. Some {{of the most commonly}} known of severe weather advisories are the severe thunderstorm and tornado warning, as well as the severe thunderstorm and tornado watch. Other forms of these advisories include winter weather, high wind, flood, tropical cyclone, <b>and</b> <b>fog.</b> Severe weather advisories and alerts are broadcast through the media, including radio, using emergency systems as the Emergency Alert System, which break into regular programming.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor was}} the weather within the {{operational}} theater. The cyclical monsoon patterns {{meant that the}} weather was deplorable for flight operations eight {{months of the year}} (from late September to early May) when rain <b>and</b> <b>fog</b> tended to conceal targets. Lack of adequate all-weather and night-bombing capability made it necessary for the majority of U.S. missions to be conducted during daylight hours, thereby easing the burden on the air defense forces of North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Low {{attendance}} and poor weather marred the contest, which kicked off amid rain <b>and</b> <b>fog.</b> Defense dominated from the beginning, as Georgia Tech took a 30 {{lead in the}} first quarter. Wake Forest evened the score before halftime, however, and the two teams headed into the second half tied at 33. After a scoreless third quarter, Georgia Tech took a 63 lead {{early in the fourth}} quarter. After Tech quarterback Reggie Ball threw a critical interception, Wake Forest was able to tie the game, then take a 96 lead. With time running out, Wake's defense denied Georgia Tech a game-winning score, and Wake Forest clinched the win.|$|E

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{describes the}} full-scale {{installation of the}} wastewater treatment system at the Portion Pack Industries (Division of Heinz) plant in Chatsworth, California. The plant manufactures various products including salad dressing, sauces, ketchup, mayonnaise, honey mustard, toppings, condiments and other snack food products. More than twenty different products are manufactured at the same facility. Produced wastewater, therefore, varies on an hourly, daily and seasonal basis. Wastewater resulting from the manufacturing process contains significant amounts of suspended solids (TSS), fats, oil <b>and</b> grease (<b>FOGs),</b> <b>and</b> suspended and dissolved organics (COD and BOD), with occasional high salinity (sodium chloride). TSS <b>and</b> <b>FOGs</b> can sediment <b>and</b> deposit in pipes, pumps and tanks at the municipal treatment plant (POTW). It is therefore advisable to remove such contaminants on site and avoid costly fees and fines. Pilot studies indicated that hybrid centrifugal dissolved air flotation (the GEM System) can almost completely remove TSS <b>and</b> <b>FOGs</b> <b>and</b> significantly reduce COD and BODs. In Spring 2007, a system including large underground equalization tanks, screen, coagulation, flocculation, GEM System flotation, sludge draining and pH controls was installed. The treatment system removes TSS <b>and</b> <b>FOGs</b> to less than 20 and 1 mg/l respectively, while producing sludge with more than 20 % solids loading. The system responds very fast (within minutes) to changes in wastewater quality. CODs and BODs are also reduced (50 - 75 % reductions). Contaminants removal results in significant savings in fees and fines...|$|R

5|$|On January 6, 2010, Disney {{announced}} that the film would be released in the United States and Canada on May 20, 2011, following Columbia Pictures' announcement of a delay in the Spider-Man reboot and Paramount Pictures slating Thor for May 6, 2011. The film was released in IMAX 3D, as well as traditional 2D and IMAX format, with Dolby 7.1 surround sound. This film {{was also the first}} film to be released in the 4DX motion theaters in Mexico and in the Western Hemisphere, featuring strobe lights, tilting seats, blowing wind <b>and</b> <b>fog</b> and odor effects. It is available exclusively at select Cinépolis cinemas.|$|E
5|$|The route {{runs through}} an area subject to {{significant}} air temperature variations. The temperature extremes {{measured in the}} area of the route range from , imposing substantial maintenance requirements. The weather patterns prevailing along the route include: an average of three to four days of snow cover, especially in the central parts of Istria; high winds and gales east of the Učka Tunnel, recorded during, respectively, 15 and 54days per year on average; <b>and</b> <b>fog</b> in the areas west of the Učka mountains and around Pazin, respectively occurring 80 and 50days per year on average.|$|E
5|$|With the {{darkness}} <b>and</b> <b>fog,</b> Mexican soldiers could not estimate {{how many men}} had surrounded them. They withdrew 300 yards (meters) to a nearby bluff. At about 6am, Texians emerged from the trees and began firing at the Mexican soldiers. Lieutenant Gregorio Pérez counterattacked with 40 mounted soldiers. The Texians fell back to the trees and fired a volley, injuring a Mexican private. According to some accounts, the cannon {{fell out of the}} wagon upon the shot. Unable to safely maneuver among the trees, the Mexican horsemen returned to the bluff.|$|E

5000|$|Wrangel Island is {{influenced}} by both the Arctic and Pacific air masses. One consequence is the predominance of high winds. The island is subjected to [...] "cyclonic" [...] episodes characterized by rapid circular winds. It is also an island of mists <b>and</b> <b>fogs.</b>|$|R
5|$|Daun's {{battle plan}} took the Prussians {{completely}} by surprise. The {{east side of}} Frederick's line {{was the first to}} be attacked. Using the starless night <b>and</b> <b>fog</b> as cover, and grouped into small shock units for easier control and stealth, the Austrians fell on the Prussian battery when the church bell signaled 5:00, catching the Prussians completely off guard. Many men were still sleeping, or just waking up, when the attack started. After setting fire to the village, the Croats cut tent ropes, causing the canvas to fall on sleeping soldiers, then bayoneted the men as they struggled to free themselves from canvas and cords. Men tangled in the tents bled to death, in what today is still called Blutgasse, or Blood Alley.|$|E
5|$|Gales <b>and</b> <b>fog</b> {{prevented}} the British from conducting further attacks between 25 and 28 August. On 25 August Indefatigable, Formidable, two cruisers and seven destroyers refuelled from the oilers. Both of the cruisers later {{detached from the}} force and returned to Scapa Flow. Duke of York, Furious, a cruiser and five destroyers also sailed to the Faroe Islands to load supplies. Before leaving the fleet, Furious transferred two Barracudas {{and a pair of}} Hellcats to Indefatigable. As the elderly Furious was judged to be no longer capable of combat operations, she proceeded from the Faroe Islands to Scapa Flow with the cruiser and several destroyers. On 29 August Duke of York and the remaining destroyers rejoined {{the main body of the}} Home Fleet off north Norway. During this period, the flying squadrons' maintenance personnel worked to repair aircraft which had been damaged during the 24 August attacks.|$|E
5|$|Imperator Aleksandr III and {{the other}} ships of the {{division}} briefly followed Knyaz Suvorov until {{it became clear that}} the latter ship was out of control and then turned north in an effort to get behind Tōgō's ships. Knyaz Suvorov never regained her position in the battle line and became the primary target of the Japanese for a time. Around 16:00 the captain of Imperator Alexandr III, Nikolai Bukhvostov, decided to duplicate 's maneuver at the Battle of the Yellow Sea by charging straight for the Japanese battleline in an attempt to focus their attention on his ship rather than Knyaz Suvorov. He was successful, but Imperator Aleksandr III was badly damaged in the process. Borodino now assumed the lead position and turned the fleet to the south where they temporarily managed to disengage in the mist <b>and</b> <b>fog.</b>|$|E

5|$|In late June, Korvettenkapitän Karl Bartenbach, {{head of the}} Flanders Flotilla, used UB-6 to test {{a theory}} that British {{defenses}} in the Straits of Dover—anti-submarine nets and mines—were not insurmountable. On the evening of 21 June, UB-6 departed Zeebrugge for a round-trip to Boulogne. UB-6 sailed past Dunkirk {{on the surface and}} made Boulogne in the early morning of the 22nd, having to crash dive once during the voyage when discovered by a British destroyer. UB-6 immediately made the return trip and arrived safely at Zeebrugge later the same day. Three other UB I boats, , , and , soon followed with patrols in the Channel, but bad weather <b>and</b> <b>fog</b> hampered the boats and none had any success. Even though no ships were sunk during these forays into the English Channel, by successfully completing their voyages, the submarines helped further prove the feasibility of defeating the British countermeasures in the Straits of Dover.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is set in}} a {{reproduction}} of 11,000 square miles of the San Francisco Bay Area. The player may land at or takeoff from the area's 46 airports. Weather conditions such as rain, wind <b>and</b> <b>fog</b> are simulated. Players share the game's airspace with up to 600 artificially intelligent (AI) planes, which fly and respond to the player in real-time. Real-time air traffic control (ATC) directs the player and the AI planes to prevent collisions. The player interacts with the ATC and with other planes by constructing radio messages with a menu. Three cockpit views are available: IFR (instrument flight rules), which allows the player to monitor and interact with all flight instruments; VFR (visual flight rules), which features a larger windshield area but fewer flight instruments; and Virtual Cockpit View, which allows free look but features no interactive flight instruments. External camera angles are also available, and the player may ride as a passenger in any AI plane.|$|E
