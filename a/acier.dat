We report here a cognitively normal 63 -year-old woman who around the age of 12  years had developed dystonic symptoms that gradually evolved into generalized dystonia. Extensive investigations, including metabolic diagnostics and diagnostic exome sequencing, were performed to elucidate the cause of dystonia. Findings were only compatible with a diagnosis of <b>ACY</b> 1 deficiency: the urinary metabolite pattern with N-acetylated amino acids was characteristic, there was decreased <b>ACY</b> 1 activity in immortalized lymphocytes, and two compound heterozygous <b>ACY</b> 1 mutations were detected, one well-characterized c. 1057 C>T (p.

However, following co-transfection of cells with stable expression of the c. 1057 C>T variant with either wild-type <b>ACY</b> 1 or the c. 325 A>G mutant, only the wild-type enhanced <b>ACY</b> 1 activity and <b>ACY</b> 1 presence in the Western blot, suggesting an inhibiting interference between the two variants.

Aminoacylase 1 (<b>ACY</b> 1; EC 3. 5. 14) is the most abundant of the aminoacylases, a class of enzymes involved in hydrolysis of N-acetylated proteins. Here, we present four children with genetic deficiency of <b>ACY</b> 1. They were identified through organic acid analyses using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, revealing increased urinary excretion of several N-acetylated amino acids, including the derivatives of methionine, glutamic acid, alanine, leucine, glycine, valine, and isoleucine. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis of urine samples detected a distinct pattern of N-acetylated metabolites, consistent with <b>ACY</b> 1 dysfunction. Functional analyses of patients' lymphoblasts demonstrated <b>ACY</b> 1 deficiency. Mutation analysis uncovered recessive loss-of-function or missense <b>ACY</b> 1 mutations in all four individuals affected. We conclude that <b>ACY</b> 1 mutations in these children led to functional <b>ACY</b> 1 deficiency and excretion of N-acetylated amino acids. Questions remain, however, as to the clinical significance of <b>ACY</b> 1 deficiency. The <b>ACY</b> 1 -deficient individuals were ascertained through urine metabolic screening because of unspecific psychomotor delay (one subject), psychomotor delay with atrophy of the vermis and syringomyelia (one subject), marked muscular hypotonia (one subject), and follow-up for early treated biotinidase deficiency and normal clinical findings (one subject). Because <b>ACY</b> 1 is evolutionarily conserved in fish, frog, mouse, and human and is expressed in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) in human, a role in CNS function or development is conceivable but has yet to be demonstrated.

40|$|International audienceAminoacylase 1 (<b>ACY</b> 1) is a zinc-binding enzyme which hydrolyzes -acetyl {{amino acids}} into the {{free amino acid}} and acetic acid. Deficiency of <b>ACY</b> 1 due to {{mutations}} in the gene follows an autosomal-recessive trait of inheritance and is characterized by accumulation of -acetyl amino acids in the urine. In affected individuals neurological findings such as febrile seizures, delay of psychomotor development and moderate mental retardation have been reported. Except for one missense mutation which has been studied in, mutations underlying <b>ACY</b> 1 deficiency have not been characterized so far. This has prompted us to approach expression studies of all mutations known to occur in <b>ACY</b> 1 deficient individuals in a human cell line (HEK 293), thus providing the authentic human machinery for posttranslational modifications. Mutations were inserted using site directed mutagenesis and <b>ACY</b> 1 enzyme activity was assessed in cells overexpressing <b>ACY</b> 1, using mainly the natural high affinity substrate -acetyl methionine. Overexpression of the wild type enzyme in HEK 293 cells resulted in an approximately 50 -fold increase of the <b>ACY</b> 1 activity of homogenized cells. Most mutations resulted in a nearly complete loss of enzyme function. Notably, the two newly discovered mutations p. Arg 378 Trp, p. Arg 378 Gln and the mutation p. Arg 393 His yielded considerable residual activity of the enzyme, which is tentatively explained by their intramolecular localization and molecular characteristics. In contrast to <b>ACY</b> 1 variants which showed no detectable <b>ACY</b> 1 activity, <b>ACY</b> 1 proteins with the mutations p. Arg 378 Trp, p. Arg 378 Gln and p.

40|$|Anthocyanins (<b>ACYs)</b> are {{polyphenol}} compounds {{found in}} nature, which contribute vivid colors to many fruits and vegetables, while also possessing significant health benefits. These pigments range in color from orange-red to blue-violet and {{could serve as}} natural colorants to replace artificial additives. There is a great demand from consumers to have fewer artificial compounds in their foods. However, the relatively instability of <b>ACYs</b> must be further understood in order to limit color degradation before they can completely replace synthetic colorants. <b>ACYs</b> slowly degrade over time, {{but there is a}} knowledge gap on their fate and mechanisms causing degradation. In order to understand the mechanistic changes, different techniques were employed to understand <b>ACY</b> transformations over storage. Various types of solid phase extraction, high-pressure liquid chromatography columns, and gel electrophoresis analyses were used in an attempt to separate anthocyanin-tannin polymers by degree of polymerization. These compounds were detected using mass spectrometry, but separation by chromatographic techniques was not possible. Ascorbic acid accelerates <b>ACY</b> degradation, but the mechanism was controversial. Model systems of a pure <b>ACY,</b> cyanidin- 3 -glucoside (C 3 G), and blackberry juice supplemented with ascorbic acid were prepared and hydroxyl radicals formed via the Haber-Weiss reaction. Hydroxyl radicals are highly unstable and reacted with C 3 G forming 6 -hydroxy-C 3 G, which degrades faster than C 3 G. The combination of identifying the hydroxylated <b>ACY</b> using tandem mass spectrometry and detection the hydroxyl radicals via electron spin resonance verified the reaction mechanism of ascorbic acid catalyzed degradation of <b>ACYs.</b> Next, blackberry juice was supplemented with various additives to understand <b>ACY</b> stabilization mechanisms. Glutathione significantly improved anthocyanin retention over storage, so combinations of glutathione with lipoic and ascorbic acids were added to assess a potential antioxidant recycling mechanism. The combination was not more effective at stabilizing <b>ACYs</b> than glutathione alone. Finally, novel <b>ACY</b> compounds were created from radishes through a reaction originally found in wine fermentation. Using acetaldehyde as a polymerization agent, radish <b>ACYs</b> reacted with catechin to form stable pigments that were identified by mass spectrometry. This research furthers the understanding of anthocyanin reactions and degradation mechanisms, which improves their use as natural colorants in the food and beverage industry...|$|R

40|$|The aminoacylase- 1 /metallopeptidase 20 (<b>Acy</b> 1 /M 20) family {{features}} several l-aminoacylases {{useful in}} biocatalysis. Mammalian <b>Acy</b> 1, in particular, {{has been applied}} in racemic resolution and reverse hydrolysis. Despite recent advances {{in our understanding of}} the active site architecture and functioning, determinants of <b>Acy</b> 1 substrate specificity have remained uncharted. Comparison to bacterial homologues points to a sterically more restricted acyl-binding pocket for <b>Acy</b> 1. Here we sought to map characteristics of the acyl-binding pocket of human and porcine <b>Acy</b> 1. Toward this end, we determined Michaelis constants for an analogue series of aliphatic N-acyl- l-methionine substrates and translated the values into three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship models employing the minimal topological difference-partial least square method. The QSAR models for the two enzymes suggest overall similar binding pockets in the acetyl-binding portion and indicate a general preference for straight-chain acyl moieties. Embedding of the QSAR map for human <b>Acy</b> 1 in the structure of its metal-binding domain associates the side chain of Ile 177 with limited acyl chain elongation which was not observed for the porcine enzyme. The topological model further supports roles of Thr 347 and Leu 372, which are both conserved in the porcine enzyme, in restricting acyl chain branching at the alpha- and beta-positions, respectively. Mutational analyses confirmed our predictions for Thr 347 and Leu 372. Moreover, the T 347 S variant of human <b>Acy</b> 1 exhibited markedly increased catalytic efficiency against N-benzoylamino acids, demonstrating the potential for engineering of substrate specificity in <b>Acy</b> 1.
