5|$|<b>Argentina</b> {{possesses}} definite comparative {{advantages in}} agriculture, {{as the country}} is endowed with {{a vast amount of}} highly fertile land. Between 1860 and 1930, exploitation of the rich land of the pampas strongly pushed economic growth. During the first three decades of the 20th century, <b>Argentina</b> outgrew Canada and Australia in population, total income, and per capita income. By 1913, <b>Argentina</b> was the world's 10th wealthiest nation per capita.|$|E

5|$|Simmering {{tensions}} between the UK and <b>Argentina</b> increased {{during the second half}} of the century, when Argentine President Juan Perón asserted sovereignty over the archipelago. The sovereignty dispute intensified during the 1960s, shortly after the United Nations passed a resolution on decolonisation which <b>Argentina</b> interpreted as favourable to its position. In 1965, the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 2065, calling for both states to conduct bilateral negotiations to reach a peaceful settlement of the dispute. From 1966 until 1968, the UK confidentially discussed with <b>Argentina</b> the transfer of the Falklands, assuming its judgement would be accepted by the islanders. An agreement on trade ties between the archipelago and the mainland was reached in 1971 and, consequently, <b>Argentina</b> built a temporary airfield at Stanley in 1972. Nonetheless, Falklander dissent, as expressed by their strong lobby in the UK Parliament, and {{tensions between}} the UK and <b>Argentina</b> effectively limited sovereignty negotiations until 1977.|$|E

40|$|Economists in the United States wrote {{reams of}} {{commentary}} on <b>Argentina’s</b> recession-turned-depression of 1998 - 2002. Most ignored basic facts that were readily available. As a result, they committed important errors, including mistaking <b>Argentina’s</b> central banking {{system for a}} currency board and claiming that <b>Argentina’s</b> exports were uncompetitive when in fact <b>Argentina’s</b> share of world exports was growing. The faulty analysis of U. S. and other economists provided justifications for decisions by the Argentine government in early 2002 to devalue the Argentine peso and forcibly convert U.

The United States team, which featured six British-born players, lost midfielder Raphael Tracy after ten minutes to a broken leg as the match became violent. A Monti goal halfway through the first half gave <b>Argentina</b> a 1–0 half-time lead.

5|$|<b>Argentina</b> had a tense {{relationship}} with the United Kingdom because of the recently ended Falklands War. The British government banned all foreign ships from the exclusion zone of the islands in 1986. <b>Argentina</b> organised air and marine patrols, as well as military maneuvers in the Patagonia. However, this {{was not enough to}} placate the military hard-liners in <b>Argentina.</b> Alfonsín proposed the postponement the sovereignty discussions, instead negotiating for a de jure cease of hostilities, with a {{reduction in the number of}} military forces and a normalization of Argentina–United Kingdom relations.

5|$|<b>Argentina,</b> {{like many}} other countries, entered into a {{recession}} following the beginning of World War I as international flows of goods, capital and labour declined. Foreign investment in <b>Argentina</b> came to a complete standstill from which it never fully recovered: Great Britain had become heavily indebted to the United States {{during the war and}} would never again export capital at a comparable scale. And after the opening of the Panama canal in 1914, <b>Argentina</b> and the other Southern cone economies declined, as investors turned their attention to Asia and the Caribbean. The United States, which came out of the war a political and financial superpower, especially perceived <b>Argentina</b> (and to a lesser extent Brazil) as a potential rival on world markets. Neither the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange nor the private domestic banks developed rapidly enough to fully replace British capital.|$|E

5|$|Ferrari {{undertook}} additional medical {{study in}} Europe and the United States, learning pioneering techniques that she {{brought back to}} <b>Argentina.</b> She studied urinary tract monitoring at the Medical Faculty of Paris, earning the first diploma ever given to a woman.

30|$|All in all, our conclusion, however, is that <b>Argentina’s</b> {{democracy}} has {{allowed for a}} much brighter performance in economic terms than it is usually credited for.
