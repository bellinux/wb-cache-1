5|$|Preterm newborns {{are known}} to be <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> for bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} with extended exposure to high concentrations of oxygen. Other groups <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> for oxygen toxicity are patients on mechanical ventilation with exposure to levels of oxygen greater than 50%, and patients exposed to chemicals that increase risk for oxygen toxicity such the chemotherapeutic agent bleomycin. Therefore, current guidelines for patients on mechanical ventilation in intensive care recommends keeping oxygen concentration less than 60%. Likewise, divers who undergo treatment of decompression sickness are at increased risk of oxygen toxicity as treatment entails exposure to long periods of oxygen breathing under hyperbaric conditions, in addition to any oxygen exposure during the dive.|$|E

40|$|We {{estimated}} cost-effectiveness of annually vaccinating {{children not}} <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> with inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) {{to range from}} US $ 12, 000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved for children ages 6 - 23 months to $ 119, 000 per QALY saved for children ages 12 - 17 years. For children <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> (preexisting medical conditions) ages 6 - 35 months, vaccination with IIV was cost saving. For children <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> ages 3 - 17 years, vaccination cost $ 1, 000 -$ 10, 000 per QALY. Among children not <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> ages 5 - 17 years, live, attenuated influenza vaccine had a similar cost-effectiveness as IIV. Risk status {{was more important than}} age in determining the economic effects of annual vaccination, and vaccination was less cost-effective as the child's age increased. Thus, routine vaccination of all children is likely less cost-effective than vaccination of all children ages 6 - 23 months plus all other children <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk.</b> Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
25|$|Taking aspirin is {{associated}} with a 1% to 5% reduction in pre-eclampsia and a 1% to 5% reduction in premature births in women <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk.</b> The World Health Organization recommends low-dose aspirin for the prevention of pre-eclampsia in women <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> and recommends it be started before 20 weeks of pregnancy. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends a low-dose regimen for women <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> beginning in the 12th week. Benefits are less if started after 16 weeks.|$|R
5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamsters {{may also}} live near areas of human civilization. In Mongolia, {{they may be}} found in yurts to keep warm during the winter, as they do not have {{thermoregulation}} like the Djungarian hamster. They have five main predators: the Eurasian eagle owl, the steppe eagle, the corsac fox, the common kestrel, and the saker falcon. All distribution areas have more females than males, because males are <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> from predators, as they cannot move as quickly.|$|E
5|$|Genetics {{may play}} a role in the risk that a person will develop PTE; people with the ApoE-ε4 allele may be <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> for PTE. The {{haptoglobin}} Hp2-2 allele may be another genetic risk factor, possibly because it binds hemoglobin poorly and thus allows more iron to escape and damage tissues. However, most studies have found that having family members with epilepsy does not significantly increase the risk of PTS, suggesting that genetics are not a strong risk factor.|$|E
5|$|In {{the view}} of the {{production}} team, Peggy's breast cancer was a catalyst, creating new dynamics and tensions amongst existing characters. Realism was also an issue.

5|$|Women with {{a family}} history of endometrial cancer are <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk.</b> Two genes most {{commonly}} associated with some other women's cancers, BRCA1 and BRCA2, do not cause endometrial cancer. There is an apparent link with these genes but it is attributable to the use of tamoxifen, a drug that itself can cause endometrial cancer, in breast and ovarian cancers. The inherited genetic condition Cowden syndrome can also cause endometrial cancer. Women with this disorder have a 5–10%lifetime risk of developing endometrial cancer, compared to the 2–3%risk for unaffected women.|$|E
5|$|Almost 25% {{of women}} will {{experience}} {{mental health issues}} over their lifetime. Women are <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> than men from anxiety, depression, and psychosomatic complaints. Globally, depression is the leading disease burden. In the United States, women have depression twice as often as men. The economic costs of depression in American women {{are estimated to be}} $20 billion every year. The risks of depression in women have been linked to changing hormonal environment that women experience, including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth and the menopause. Women also metabolise drugs used to treat depression differently to men. Suicide rates are less in women than men (<1% vs. 2.4%), but are a leading cause of death for women under the age of 60.|$|E
5|$|Birt, Hogg, and Dubé {{examined}} {{a family with}} a hereditary thyroid cancer and discovered {{that many of the}} members had fibrofolliculomas, trichodiscomas, and acrochordons, which became defined as the classical symptoms of the eponymous disease. The first case of spontaneous pneumothorax associated with BHD was discovered in 1986; the first case of renal cancer followed in 1993 and the presence of lung cysts in people with BHD was confirmed in 1999. It was formerly thought that people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome were <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> for colorectal polyps and neoplasms, but this has been disproven. The BHD Foundation supports research into the syndrome and holds regular symposia in BHD and related disorders for researchers, clinicians, and family members.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Stroke is {{the leading}} cause of death and disability, and is closely related to a lack of {{exercise}}. Currently, most Chinese medical staff members lack exercise and may be at risk for stroke. We sought to determine the risk factors for stroke and study the significance of health-related physical fitness testing in stroke prevention among Chinese medical staff members. Methods: A total of 627 subjects from Urumqi, Xinjiang, China, were included in the study and a survey was conducted from 1 st January 2016 to 1 st February 2016. Stroke screening and health-related physical fitness testing were completed according to the standard protocol, and the related data were analyzed. Results: Based on the screening, 27. 6 % (n =  173) of the subjects were <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> for stroke. The top risk factors for stroke in these subjects were dyslipidemia, lack of exercise or mild physical activity, being overweight or obese, and high blood pressure. Body weight, body mass index, body fat, visceral fat area, body fat percentage, and basal metabolic rate were significantly higher (P <  0. 01) in subjects <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> for stroke than in subjects who were not <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk.</b> Lung capacity, step index, grip test, vertical jump, and sit-up/push-up index were significantly lower (P <  0. 01) in subjects <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> for stroke than in subjects who were not <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk.</b> Conclusions: A large proportion of China's on-the-job medical personnel is <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> for stroke. This may be related to the nature of the profession and warrants more attention from the society. The health-related physical fitness measurement parameters in subjects <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> for stroke were significantly different from those in subjects who were not <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk.</b> Screening and health-related physical fitness testing in medical staff members may contribute to stroke prevention. More rigorous controlled clinical trials will be needed in the future. Keywords: Stroke, <b>High</b> <b>risk</b> population, Health-related physical fitness, Preventio...|$|R

5|$|Endometrial cancer appears most {{frequently}} during perimenopause (the period just before, just after, and during menopause), {{between the ages}} of 50 and 65; overall, 75% of endometrial cancer occurs after menopause. Women younger than 40 make up 5% of endometrial cancer cases and 10–15% of cases occur in women under 50years of age. This age group is at risk for developing ovarian cancer at the same time. The worldwide median age of diagnosis is 63years of age; in the United States, the average age of diagnosis is 60years of age. White American women are <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> for endometrial cancer than black American women, with a 2.88% and 1.69% lifetime risk respectively. Japanese-American women and American Latina women have a lower rates and Native Hawaiian women have higher rates.|$|E
5|$|Even a {{slightly}} dehydrated horse is <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> of developing impaction colic. Additionally, dehydration {{can lead to}} weight loss because the horse cannot produce adequate amounts of saliva, thus decreasing the amount of feed and dry forage consumed. Thus, {{it is especially important}} for horse owners to encourage their horses to drink when there is a risk of dehydration; when horses are losing a great deal of water in hot weather due to strenuous work, or in cold weather due to horses' natural tendency to drink less when in a cold environment. To encourage drinking, owners may add electrolytes to the feed, additives to make the water especially palatable (such as apple juice), or, when it is cold, to warm the water so that it is not at a near-freezing temperature.|$|E

5|$|Suicide is {{the act of}} {{intentionally}} causing one's own death. Risk {{factors include}} mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, and substance abuse, including alcoholism and use of benzodiazepines. Other suicides are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or from bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> for future attempts. Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to methods of suicide, such as firearms, drugs, and poisons, treating mental disorders and substance misuse, proper media reporting of suicide, and improving economic conditions. Although crisis hotlines are common, {{there is little evidence}} for their effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|Globally, {{cervical}} {{cancer is the}} fourth commonest cancer amongst women, particularly those of lower socioeconomic status. Women in this group have reduced access to health care, high rates of child and forced marriage, parity, polygamy and exposure to STIs from multiple sexual contacts of male partners. All of these factors place them <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk.</b> In developing countries, {{cervical cancer}} accounts for 12% of cancer cases amongst women and is the second leading cause of death, where about 85% of the global burden of over 500,000 cases and 250,000 deaths from this disease occurred in 2012. The highest incidence occurs in Eastern Africa, where with Middle Africa, cervical cancer is the commonest cancer in women. The case fatality rate of 52% is also higher in developing countries than in developed countries (43%), and the mortality rate varies by 18-fold between regions of the world.|$|E
5|$|In adults, {{widespread}} {{screening of}} the general population is a matter of debate. Some organizations (such as the United States Preventive Services Task Force) state that evidence is insufficient to support routine screening, while others (such as the American Thyroid Association) recommend either intermittent testing above a certain age in both sexes or only in women. Targeted screening may be appropriate in a number of situations where hypothyroidism is common: other autoimmune diseases, a strong family history of thyroid disease, those who have received radioiodine or other radiation therapy to the neck, those who have previously undergone thyroid surgery, those with an abnormal thyroid examination, those with psychiatric disorders, people taking amiodarone or lithium, and those with a number of health conditions (such as certain heart and skin conditions).

5|$|Toothache {{may occur}} at any age, in any gender {{and in any}} {{geographic}} region. Diagnosing and relieving toothache {{is considered one of}} the main responsibilities of dentists. Irreversible pulpitis is thought to be the most common reason that people seek emergency dental treatment. Since dental caries associated with pulpitis is the most common cause, toothache is more common in populations that are <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> of dental caries. The prevalence of caries in a population is dependent upon factors such as diet (refined sugars), socioeconomic status, and exposure to fluoride (such as areas without water fluoridation). In the United States, an estimated 12% of the general population reported that they suffered from toothache at some point in the six months before questioning. Individuals aged 18–34 reported much higher experience of toothache than those aged 75 or over. In a survey of Australian schoolchildren, 12% had experienced toothache before the age of five, and 32% by the age of 12.
