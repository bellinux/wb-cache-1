5|$|Maupertuis' {{ideas were}} in {{opposition}} to the influence of early taxonomists like John Ray. In the late 17th century, Ray had given the first formal definition of a biological species, which he described as being characterized by essential unchanging features, and stated the seed of one species could never give rise to another. The ideas of Ray and other 17th-century taxonomists were influenced by natural theology <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> from design.|$|E
5|$|Trujillo and Sheppard {{in a paper}} {{announcing the}} {{discovery}} of several more distant objects noted a correlation between the longitude of perihelion <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> of perihelion of these objects. Those with a longitude of perihelion of 0–120° have arguments of perihelion between 280–360°, and those with longitude of perihelion of 180–340° have argument of perihelion 0–40°. The statistical significance of this correlation was 99.99%. They suggest that the correlation {{is due to the}} orbits of these objects avoiding close approaches to Planet Nine by passing above or below its orbit. Trujillo and Sheppard also noted that the arguments of perihelion of ETNOs with perihelion less than 35 AU are opposite those with perihelion greater than 35 AU.|$|E

25|$|After Locke, {{constructive}} deism {{could no}} longer appeal to innate ideas for justification of its basic tenets such as the existence of God.

25|$|Both {{of these}} claims have been criticized: Michael D. Coe and David Stuart {{argue that the}} {{surviving}} corpus of the few known examples of Isthmian inscriptions is insufficient to securely ground any proposed decipherment. Their attempt to apply Kaufman's and Justeson's decipherments to other extant Isthmian material failed to produce any meaningful results. Wichmann (1995) criticizes certain proposed Mixe–Zoquean loans into other Mesoamerican languages as being only Zoquean, not Mixean, which would put the period of borrowing much later than the Proto-Mixe Zoquean time-frame in which the Olmec culture was at its height. The date of the Mixe–Zoque split has however since been pushed back, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> is therefore much weaker than it once was thought to be.|$|E
25|$|Different sets of {{elements}} {{are used for}} various astronomical bodies.

The choices made depend whether the vernal equinox or the node are used as the primary reference. The semi-major axis is known if the mean motion and the gravitational mass are known.|$|E

25|$|III. Rheme, dicisign, {{argument}} (also called sumisign, dicisign, suadisign, also seme, pheme, delome, {{and regarded}} as very broadened {{versions of the}} traditional term, proposition, argument): This typology classifies every sign according to the category which the interpretant attributes to the sign's way of denoting its object—the rheme, for example a term, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of quality; the dicisign, for example a proposition, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of fact; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of habit or law.

25|$|Since around 1800, {{ideas of}} {{evolutionism}} had been denounced {{as examples of}} dangerous materialism, which undermined natural theology <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> from design, threatening the current moral and social order. Such ideas were propagated by lower class Radicals seeking to overturn divine justification of the (aristocratic) social order. Chambers supported middle class political interests, and saw laws of progress in nature as implying inevitable political progress. He sought to sanitise the radical tradition by presenting progressive evolution as an unfolding of divinely planned laws of creation as development {{up to and including}} the appearance of human species. The political climate had eased as increasing prosperity reduced fears of revolution, and the book was widely considered to be merely scandalous and titillating. It was read not only by members of high society, but also — thanks to the rise of cheap publishing — the lower and middle classes, and continued to sell in large quantities {{for the rest of the}} 19th century.|$|E
25|$|By the 1960s, {{civil rights}} {{organizations}} were helping interracial couples {{who were being}} penalized for their relationships to take their cases to the Supreme Court. Since Pace v. Alabama, the court had declined {{to make a judgment}} in such cases. But in 1964, the Warren Court decided to issue a ruling {{in the case of an}} interracial couple from Florida who had been convicted because they had cohabited. In McLaughlin v. Florida, the Supreme Court ruled that the Florida state law which prohibited cohabitation between whites and non-whites was unconstitutional and based solely on a policy of racial discrimination. However, the court did not rule on Florida's ban on marriage between whites and non-whites, despite the appeal of the plaintiffs to do so <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> made by the state of Florida that its ban on cohabitation between whites and blacks was ancillary to its ban on marriage between whites and blacks. However, in 1967, the court did decide to rule on the remaining anti-miscegenation laws when it was presented with the case of Loving v. Virginia.|$|E

40|$|The {{precondition}} of "lifelong learning" and "adult education" since 1980 s in Japan {{has been}} "diversification of learning opportunity". But {{the concept of}} "diversification of learning opportunity" has been unclear. So it must be examined in detail. To examine it, <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> from 1930 s (which influenced <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> after World War II) to 1970 s about adult education need to be reexamined. Concretely, <b>the</b> following <b>arguments</b> need to be reexamined : <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> about <b>the</b> relation between "Education" <b>and</b> "Society", <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> about "Structure" of adult education, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> about integrating "Subject of education and learning" "Con tents of education" and "Methods of educating"...|$|R
500|$|Concerns that {{defamation}} under {{common law}} might be {{incompatible with the}} new republican form of government caused early American courts to struggle between William Blackstone's argument that the punishment of [...] "dangerous or offensive writings [...] [...] [...] [...] necessary {{for the preservation of}} peace and good order, of government and religion, the only solid foundations of civil liberty" [...] <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> that the need for a free press guaranteed by the Constitution outweighed the fear of what might be written. Consequently, very few changes were made in the first two centuries after the ratification of the First Amendment.|$|E
500|$|In 1903, the Kennel Club {{attempted}} to amalgamate the King James (black and tan), Prince Charles (tricolour), Blenheim and Ruby spaniels {{into a single}} breed called the Toy Spaniel. The Toy Spaniel Club, which oversaw those separate breeds, strongly objected, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> was only resolved following the intervention of King Edward VII, who {{made it clear that}} he preferred the name [...] "King Charles Spaniel". In 1904, the American Kennel Club followed suit, combining the four breeds into a single breed known as the English Toy Spaniel. The Japanese Spaniel was also considered a type of toy spaniel, but was not merged into the new breed and was recognised as a breed in its own right.|$|E
500|$|Marshall then {{addressed}} the Commerce Clause issues, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> of the Solicitor General that {{the section of}} the Commerce Clause that dealt directly with Indians applied rather than the argument of the oil companies that the section dealing with interstate commerce applied. [...] First, Marshall noted that the case history of the Indian Commerce Clause was to protect the tribes from state infringement, not to approve of Indian trade without constitutional restraint. [...] He saw of no reason to begin now, especially since he did not find that the tribe's severance tax did not have negative implications on interstate commerce. [...] In a 6-3 decision, Marshall found that the tribe had the right to impose such a tax on non-Indians.|$|E

500|$|The {{brain in}} a vat {{argument}} {{has also been}} subject to criticism. Crispin Wright argues that Putnam's formulation of the brain-in-a-vat scenario is too narrow to refute global skepticism. The possibility that one is a recently disembodied brain in a vat is not undermined by semantic externalism. If a person has lived her entire life outside the vat—speaking the English language and interacting normally with the outside world—prior to her [...] "envatment" [...] by a mad scientist, when she wakes up inside the vat, her words and thoughts (e.g., [...] "tree" [...] and [...] "grass") will still refer to the objects or events in the external world that they referred to before her envatment. In another scenario, a brain in a vat may be {{hooked up to a}} supercomputer that randomly generates perceptual experiences. In this case, one's words and thoughts would not refer to anything, and would therefore be devoid of content. Semantics would no longer exist <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> would be meaningless.|$|E
500|$|The lack of graphics, poor {{interface}} {{and controls}} {{were seen as}} {{the reasons for the}} game's difficulty. However, the reviewers also noted most of it having a role in gameplay <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> that the text-based graphics forces players to use their own imagination, making it more engaging. Weiner wrote, [...] " [...] may not look real, but once you're hooked, it feels vast, enveloping, alive. A micro-manager's dream, the game gleefully blurs the distinction between painstaking labor and creative thrill." [...] Quintin Smith from Rock, Paper, Shotgun said, [...] "The interface has a tough job to do, bless it, but getting it {{to do what you want}} is like teaching a beetle to cook." [...] Ars Technica's Casey Johnston highlighted the difficulty in performing basic actions and felt that tinkering or experimenting ended up being unproductive; she compared it to [...] "trying to build a skyscraper by banging two rocks together". She pointed out the lack of in-game tutorial and said how players can learn by themselves in other games, which are also open-ended or have intuitive mechanics, but in Dwarf Fortress, there is no autonomy [...] "even after hours" [...] of gameplay.|$|E

He is now a different person, a Malaysian, but a Malay Malaysian whose authority in Malaya — his land — is now not only shared with others, but shared unequally. And {{as if this is}} not enough, he is being asked to give up more and more of his share of influence." [...] Mahathir's defence of Malay rights focused both on the [...] "definitive people" [...] line of reasoning <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> in favour of affirmative action, which the Reid Commission had chosen: [...] "It is not... for reasons of Malay superiority that preferential treatment for Malays in scholarship awards was insisted upon. ... They are a means of breaking down the superior position of the non-Malays in the field of education. The Malays are not proud of this treatment." [...] Shortly after becoming Prime Minister, Mahathir denied he had altered any of his views since he wrote the book.|$|E
