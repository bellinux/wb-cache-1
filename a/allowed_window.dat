These are components of the analog signal control architecture that was developed with the very earliest electromechanical traffic signal controllers. If the window for serving a particular phase has already passed, that vehicle will not be served until the controller has moved {{all the way through}} its sequences and returns to the <b>allowed</b> <b>window</b> for that phase. For example, a minor street call comes in {{near the end of the}} minor street window but it is too late for the minor street to be served before returning to the main street left turn phase. The minor street will not be served until the cycle goes all the way around the “dial”. This is a direct result of the fact that the controller is operating in an analog fashion. InSync is a digital finite state machine. Its patent-protected digital model is fully digital and is able to initiate any phase at will.2. Global OptimizerThe power in the Global Optimizer is built on the foundation of the digital architecture. The Global Optimizer model creates time tunnels through the entire corridor and if a vehicle is within the time tunnel, it can travel through the entire corridor without stopping. The longest corridor currently (November, 2015) is 26 signals on Washington Road in Richmond and Columbia Counties, GA. Commuters experience the phenomenon of driving through 26 signals in both East and West directions without stopping.3. Local OptimizerThe local optimizer is built on a greedy algorithm. Imagine a person standing at an intersection with a basket of cookies. The person has to give a cookie for every vehicle that arrives at the intersection. The person also has to give another cookie every time a vehicle waits 5 seconds. However, the person is greedy. He has the power to change the traffic signals so that he can conserve the cookies. This is the function that optimizes the traffic signals based on the number of cars waiting for green (volume) and the duration of their wait (delay). Since InSync processors are distributed without any central control, the local optimizer ensures a very high degree of green optimization.Installation and Configuration of InSync ...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a string inspired non-supersymmetric {{extension of the}} standard model with gauged anomalous U(1) flavor symmetries. Consistency requires the Green-Schwarz mechanism to cancel mixed anomalies. The additional required scalars provide Stuckelberg masses for the Z' particles associated to the gauged flavor symmetry, so they decouple at low energies. Our models also include a complex scalar field ϕ to generate Froggatt-Nielsen mass terms for light particles giving a partial solution to the fermion mass problem. A residual approximate (anomalous) global symmetry survives at low energies. The associated pseudo-Goldstone mode is the phase of the ϕ scalar field, and it becomes the dominant contribution to the physical axion. An effective field theory analysis that includes neutrino masses gives a prediction for the axion decay constant.

40|$|AbstractElectroweak baryogenesis {{provides}} an attractive {{explanation of the}} origin of the matter–antimatter asymmetry that relies on physics at the weak scale and thus it is testable at present and near future high-energy physics experiments. Although this scenario may not be realized within the Standard Model, it can be accommodated within the MSSM provided there are new CP-violating phases and the lightest stop mass is smaller than the top-quark mass. In this work we provide an evaluation of the values of the stop (mt˜) and Higgs (mH) masses consistent with the requirements of electroweak baryogenesis based on an analysis that makes use of the renormalization group improved Higgs and stop potentials, and including the dominant two-loop effects at high temperature. We find an <b>allowed</b> <b>window</b> in the (mt˜,mH) -plane, consistent with all present experimental data, where there is a strongly first-order electroweak phase transition and where the electroweak vacuum is metastable but sufficiently long-lived.

Taking the dark energy perturbation into consideration, we derive the evolution equation for δ_m and find a specific scale d_cr= 2 π/k_cr, which divides the evolution of the universe into the sub and super-interaction regimes, corresponding to k ≪ k_cr and k ≫ k_cr, respectively. For the former, the evolution of δ_m has the same behavior as that in the ΛCDM model, while for the latter, the growth of δ_m is frozen (greatly enhanced) when ν + σ >(<) 0 due to the couplings between radiation, matter and dark energy.

These maintenance periods are called Continuous Maintenance Availability (CMAV) periods. All CMAV scheduling aboard the two remaining submarine tenders in the United States fleet, the USS Emory S. Land (AS 39) and the USS Frank Cable (AS 40), is currently done manually. The schedulers rely on their experience and sound judgment {{with the goal of}} successfully completing the most maintenance as quickly and efficiently as possible for approximately 200 jobs, 50 maintenance shops {{and a host of other}} considerations. In this thesis, we develop a job-shop scheduling model, the CMAV Scheduler (CMAV-S). This is a large-scale, mixed-integer, linear program that accounts for a variety of scheduling inputs commonly used by planners: job priority, duration, <b>allowed</b> <b>window</b> of execution, prerequisites, mandatory character, workforce used and available (by shop), and special submarine conditions (active or inactive) needed to perform a job. CMAV-S produces near-optimal schedules that achieve maximum value for all scheduled jobs in about one minute.

40|$|A {{particular}} {{class of}} variant axion models with two higgs doublets and a singlet is studied. In these models the axion couples {{either to the}} $u$-quark or $t$-quark or both, but not to $b$, $c$, $s$, or $d$. When the axion couples to only one quark the models possess the desirable feature of having no domain wall problem, which makes them viable candidates for a cosmological axion string scenario. We calculate the axion couplings to leptons, photons and nucleons, and the astrophysical constraints on the axion decay constant $v_a$ are investigated and compared to the DFSZ axion model. We find that the most restrictive lower bound on $v_a$, that from SN 1987 a, is lowered by up to a factor of about 30, depending on the model and also {{the ratio of the}} vacuum expectation values of the higgs doublets. For scenarios with axionic strings, the <b>allowed</b> <b>window</b> for $v_a$ in the $u$ quark model can be more than two orders of magnitude. For inflationary scenarios, the cosmological upper bound on $v_a/N$, where $N$ is the QCD anomaly factor, is unaffected: however, the variant models have $N$ either 3 or 6 times smaller than the DFSZ model.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a heavy gluino {{to be the}} lightest supersymmetric particle [LSP]. We investigate the limits on the mass of a heavy gluino LSP, using the searches for excess events in the jets plus missing momentum channel in Run I. The neutral and charged R-hadrons, containing a heavy gluino LSP, have distinct signatures at the Fermilab Tevatron. The range of excluded gluino masses depends on whether the R-hadron is charged or neutral {{and the amount of}} energy deposited in the hadronic calorimeter. The latter depends on the energy loss per collision in the calorimeter and the number of collisions; where both quantities require a model for R-hadron- Nucleon scattering. We show how the excluded range of gluino mass depends on these parameters. We find that gluinos with mass in the range between ∼ 35 GeV and ∼ 115 GeV are excluded by CDF Run I data. Combined with previous results of Baer et al., which use LEP data to exclude the range 3 - 22 ∼ 25 GeV, our result demonstrates that an <b>allowed</b> <b>window</b> for a heavy gluino with mass between 25 and 35 GeV is quite robust. Finally we discuss the relevant differences of our analysis of Tevatron data to that of Baer et al. Comment: 36 pages, 11 figures, added an acknowledgemen...|$|E
40|$|We {{extend a}} recent {{work on the}} effect of non-perturbative Planck scale effects on models with spontaneously broken global B-L {{symmetry}}, where it was shown that scale VBL of this symmetry must be less than 10 TeV. We show that, if the Planck scale effects break CP invariance, an <b>allowed</b> <b>window</b> for VBL appears where 10 8 GeV ≤ VBL ≤ 10 11 GeV. † Work {{supported by a grant from}} the National Science Foundation 1 In recent months, there has been growing interest in the possibility[1] that non-perturbative gravitational effects may not respect any global symmetries of nature. Early work on “no hair ” theorem[2] and recent analyses of the effect of “worm-hole ” solutions on low energy particle physics seem to provide evidence for this speculation. In this brief report, we comment on the impact of this speculation on one particular class of extensions of the standard model where small neutrino mass arises in a natural manner, the singlet majoron model[3]. In a recent analysis[4] of the Planck scale effects on the singlet Majoron model, it was concluded that, there must be an upper bound on the VBL, the scale of B-L symmetry breaking i. e. VBL < (mν 25 eV) 4 / 7 × 10 TeV. (1) The basic idea is that, the Planck scale effects are expected in general to induce non-renormalizable terms of the following type in the low energy effective lagrangian...|$|E
40|$|We revisit a {{model in}} which {{neutrino}} masses and mixing are described by a two right-handed (RH) neutrino seesaw scenario, implying a strictly hierarchical light neutrino spectrum. A third decoupled RH neutrino, N_ DM with mass M_ DM, {{plays the role of}} cold dark matter (DM) and is produced by the mixing with a source RH neutrino, N_ S with mass M_ S, induced by Higgs portal interactions. The same interactions are also responsible for N_ DM decays. We discuss in detail the constraints coming from DM abundance and stability conditions, showing that in the hierarchical case (M_ DM≫ M_ S) there is an <b>allowed</b> <b>window</b> on M_ DM, which necessarily implies a contribution from DM decays to the high-energy neutrino flux recently detected by IceCube. We also show how the model can explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe via leptogenesis in the quasi-degenerate limit. In this case, the DM mass should be within the range 300 GeV ≲ M_ S < M_ DM≲ 10 PeV. We discuss the specific properties of this high-energy neutrino flux and show the predicted event spectrum for two exemplary cases. Although DM decays, with a relatively hard spectrum, cannot account for all the IceCube high-energy data, we illustrate how this extra source of high-energy neutrinos could reasonably explain some potential features in the observed spectrum. In this way, this represents a unified scenario for leptogenesis and DM that could be tested during the next years with more high-energy neutrino events.
