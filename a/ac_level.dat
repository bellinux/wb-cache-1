The SCiB technology was developed by Toshiba, which stated that its SCiB batteries can withstand 2.5 times more charge/discharge cycles than a typical lithium-ion battery. In addition, recharging via CHAdeMO takes much less time than charging at the <b>AC</b> <b>Level</b> 2 rate used by most electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), allowing the SCiB battery to reach 80% capacity in 15 minutes, 50% in 10 minutes and 25% in 5 minutes. In terms of performance, the SCiB battery offers a higher effective capacity than a typical lithium-ion battery, which combined with more efficient regenerative charging during braking or coasting downhill, allows the SCiB battery to deliver 1.7 times the driving range per charge of a typical lithium-ion battery of the same size. Alternatively, the carmaker could install a smaller battery with less weight and keep the same range to contribute to lower the vehicle price as compared to lithium-ion batteries.

Recently, {{we found that}} TPX 2 regulates the levels of serine 139 -phosphoryated H 2 AX (c-H 2 AX) at chromosomal breaks induced by ionizing radiation. Here, we report that TPX 2 readily associates with the chromatin {{in the absence of}} ionizing radiation. Overexpression of TPX 2 alters the DAPI staining pattern of interphase cells and depletion of TPX 2 constitutively decreases the levels of histone H 4 acetylated at lysine 16 (H 4 K 16 ac) during G 1 -phase. Upon ionizing irradiation, this constitutive TPX 2 depletion-dependent decrease in H 4 K 16 <b>ac</b> <b>levels</b> correlates with increased levels of c-H 2 AX.

40|$|Genetically-modified coffee clones (GMCs) were {{presented}} in a previous work. They were created from a single commercial clone of Coffea canephora Pierre (clone 126). Therefore they {{all have the same}} genotype, except for the localization of the transgenic insertions. They synthesize the Bacillus thuringiensis endotoxin Cry 1 Ac against Leucoptera coffeella Gue´- rin-Me´neville, a secondary pest of C. canephora and one of the main pest of C. arabica in South America. The synthetic Cry 1 Ac gene is regulated by the EF 1 a- A 1 promoter of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. They were tested in an experimental field for their resistance against the pest insect in a previous work. In the present work, levels of Cry 1 Ac were measured in the leaves. The insecticidal protein was evenly distributed in all the leaves. Cry 1 <b>Ac</b> <b>levels</b> were measured once in the coffee plants of a sensitive GMC and of 14 resistant ones grown in the experimental field and in plants grown in a greenhouse. Some resistant GMCs contained higher levels but {{it is not possible to}} confirm that it would be enough for a sustainable resistance to the pest. Growth speed was variable in the plot. The correlation with plant height and other indicators of plant growth was examined. Cry 1 <b>Ac</b> <b>levels</b> in the GMCs were negatively correlated with growth speed. The latter was not statistically influenced neither by Cry 1 Ac synthesis nor by the genetic modification in itself as seen by comparing the GMCs and the unmodified control clone 126. Hence the conclusion is that the growth conferred to field-grown plants by environmental factors and especially the soil was probably the underlying cause of the negative correlation. Other field experiments would be necessary in order to confirm this result. It would be important that the genetic construct inserted in these GMCs and mainly the EF 1 a-A 1 promoter of the Cry 1 Ac gene be reconsidered since Cry 1 <b>Ac</b> <b>levels</b> might be too low to provide efficient and sustainable protection against L. coffeella in a highly favourable environment for coffee plants.

The major Sia forms were liberated from sera glycoconjugates by mild acid hydrolysis, separated as per-O-benzoylated derivatives by a highly sensitive reversed-phase HPLC method and detected at 231 nm. Total Sia content in sera of healthy women was not related to age and body weight. Neu 5 Ac was identified as the major Sia in sera from both cancer patients, healthy individuals as well as in tissue specimens (greater than or equal to 94 % of total Sia). In patients with endometrial cancer the total Sia level before surgical treatment (709. 5 +/- 306. 5 mg/l) was significantly higher (p {{less than or equal to}} 0. 0001) than that of the control group (213. 5 +/- 88. 7 mg/l). The elevation in Sia level was exclusively due to Neu 5 Ac. Following surgical therapy, serum Neu 5 Ac levels (699. 4 +/- 305. 6 mg/l) were significantly decreased (305. 9 +/- 114. 5 mg/l). In one case, where Neu 5 <b>Ac</b> <b>level</b> was increased 15 days and eight months after surgery (1. 8 and 2. 5 times as compared to control, respectively), a metastasis not detected during surgery was recorded.

40|$|Trithorax group (TrxG) {{proteins}} antagonize Polycomb silencing and {{are required}} for maintenance of transcriptionally active states. We previously showed that theDrosophila melanogaster acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein (CBP) acetylates his-tone H 3 lysine 27 (H 3 K 27 ac), thereby directly blocking its trimethylation (H 3 K 27 me 3) by Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC 2) in Polycomb target genes. Here, we show that H 3 K 27 <b>ac</b> <b>levels</b> also depend on other TrxG proteins, including the histone H 3 K 27 -specific demethylase UTX and the chromatin-remodeling ATPase Brahma (BRM). We show that UTX and BRM are physically associated with CBP in vivo and that UTX, BRM, and CBP colocalize genome-wide on Polycomb response elements (PREs) and onmany active Polycomb target genes marked by H 3 K 27 ac. UTX and BRM bind directly to conserved zinc fingers of CBP, suggesting that their individual activities are functionally coupled in vivo. The bromodomain-containing C terminus of BRM binds to the CBP PHD finger, enhances PHD binding to histone H 3, and enhances in vitro acetylation of H 3 K 27 by recom-binant CBP. brmmutations and knockdown of UTX by RNA interference (RNAi) reduce H 3 K 27 <b>ac</b> <b>levels</b> and increase H 3 K 27 me 3 levels.

Currently, there are two ongoing pilot studies being conducted at the Grasse River in Massena, NY and at Hunter’s Point in San Francisco Bay, CA that are evaluating the effectiveness of treating sediments with AC in the field. As part of the successful evaluation of these pilot studies, quantification of the amount and distribution of AC applied to sediment is required. In this research a wet chemical oxidation method was developed to isolate and measure the amount of AC applied to sediments. This method used a solution of concentrated sulfuric acid and potassium dichromate to oxidize most of the naturally occurring organic carbon while preserving the AC. Analysis of sediment samples from the Grasse River and Hunter’s Point demonstrated that the AC was successfully applied in the field trials. Long term post application field samples from both sites confirmed that the AC was stable in the sediment. <b>AC</b> <b>levels</b> at the Grasse River exceeded the target dose of 2. 5 % dry weight of the sediment and AC was primarily confined to the top 3 inches of sediment.

Fatigue/cycling tests performed on shearmode samples as a function of <b>ac</b> drive field <b>level</b> demonstrated that the allowable <b>ac</b> field <b>levels</b> (the maximum applied ac field before the occurrence of depolarization) were only ∼ 2 kV/cm for unmodified crystals, less than half of their coercive field. Allowable <b>ac</b> drive <b>levels</b> were on the order of 4 to 6 kV/cm for Mn-modified crystals with rhombohedral/ orthorhombic phase, further increased to 5 to 8 kV/cm in tetragonal crystals, because of their higher coercive fields. It is of particular interest that the allowable <b>ac</b> drive field <b>level</b> for Mn-modified crystals was found to be ≥ 60...|$|R
40|$|AbstractInhibitors of histone deacetylases are {{frequently}} used against ischemia-induced injury, but the specific mechanisms of their action are poorly understood. Here, {{we report that}} following a 5 – 7 -h oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) acetylation of histone H 4 at residue K 16 (H 4 K 16 Ac) decreases by 40 – 80 % in both PC 12 cells and primary neurons. This effect can be reverted by treatment with trichostatin A, or by supplementation with acetyl-CoA. A decrease in H 4 K 16 <b>Ac</b> <b>levels</b> can affect the expression of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP 2), huntingtin-interacting protein 1 (HIP 1) and Notch-pathway genes in a cell-specific manner. Thus, H 4 K 16 acetylation is important for responses to ischemia and cell energy stress, and depends on both cytosolic and mitochondrial acetyl-CoA...|$|R

METHODS: Twenty-eight patients treated with glaucoma and cataract combined surgery were chosen as the observation group from December 2011 to June 2014 in our hospital, and other 28 cases of glaucoma and cataract did not undergo surgical treatment were selected as the control group, 30 healthy subjects were as healthy control group. the MUC 5 <b>AC</b> <b>level</b> and ocular surface score of the three subjects before surgery 1 d, after 3 and 6 mo were compared. RESULTS: The NUC 5 AC of the two groups of patients was significantly lower than that of the healthy control group before surgery(P P P P P P CONCLUSION: To treat the patients with glaucoma and cataract with combined surgery, the level of MUC 5 AC can temporary decrease. Ocular function score can temporary increase in, but after 3 mo, it can be gradually improved...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} whether concomitant exposure to cigarette smoke and coal dust could activate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) for MUC 5 AC expression. Thirty-two male Wistar rats were divided into the following groups (n =  8 each) : control group (C); exposed to cigarette smoke plus coal dust at doses of 6. 25  mg/m 3 (CS + CD 1); 12. 5  mg/m 3 (CS + CD 2); and 25  mg/m 3 (CS + CD 3). The duration of exposure was 21 days, 1 hour/day. Lung malondialdehyde level was analyzed colorimetrically. Serum EGF and MUC 5 AC expression were measured by ELISA. Expression of lung EGFR and MUC 5 AC were measured by a confocal laser scanning microscopy. The level of lung malondialdehyde was higher significantly in all doses of exposure compared with control group (p    0. 05). Serum MUC 5 AC levels were significantly lower in the two highest doses of coal dust compared with the control group. In conclusion, subchronic combined exposure to cigarette smoke and coal dust induces lung oxidative stress and inflammation and decreases serum MUC 5 <b>AC</b> <b>level...</b>|$|E
40|$|Despite many {{investigations}} {{concerning the}} outcomes of affective organizational commitment (AC) in the workplace, very few studies so far have analyzed the long-term development of AC within individuals over time. Existing research either focused on individuals’ initial employment stage or was restricted to a specific organizational context. To provide supplemental evidence, we examined the development of AC over 6 years {{in a group of}} employees that had passed their initial year of employment. Results from a factorial-invariant latent change score model with 1004 individuals from different organizations in Korea indicated an overall increase of AC over time. To further explore why individuals differ in their growth patterns, we related intra-individual changes of AC to individuals’ income in two aspects: levels and changes. Cross-lagged regression models firstly revealed positive reciprocal relationships between <b>AC</b> <b>level</b> and income level, showing an individual accumulation of AC over time. Furthermore, the study showed a significantly positive impact of income changes on AC changes, but not vice versa,illustrating the transition of AC at the individual level. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed, revealing future research on the development of commitment...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPhosphorylation of H 2 AX {{functions}} to recruit DNA repair complexes to sites of DNA damage. Here, {{we report that}} H 2 AX is constitutively acetylated on lysine 36 (H 2 AXK 36 Ac) by the CBP/p 300 acetyltransferases. H 2 AXK 36 Ac is required for cells to survive exposure to ionizing radiation; however, H 2 AXK 36 <b>Ac</b> <b>levels</b> are not increased by DNA damage. Further, acetylation of H 2 AX did not affect phosphorylation of H 2 AX or the formation of DNA damage foci. Finally, cells with a double mutation in both the H 2 AX acetylation and phosphorylation sites were more radiosensitive than cells containing individual mutations. H 2 AXK 36 Ac is therefore a novel, constitutive histone modification located within the histone core region which regulates radiation sensitivity independently of H 2 AX phosphorylation...|$|R
40|$|Three-dimensional {{positioning}} of the nuclear genome {{plays an important role}} in the epigenetic regulation of genes. Although nucleographic domain compartmentalization in the regulation of epigenetic state and gene expression is well established in higher organisms, it remains poorly understood in the pathogenic parasite Plasmodium falciparum. In the present study, we report that two histone tail modifications, H 3 K 9 Ac and H 3 K 14 Ac, are differentially distributed in the parasite nucleus. We find colocalization of active gene promoters such as Tu 1 (tubulin- 1 expressed in the asexual stages) with H 3 K 9 Ac marks at the nuclear periphery. By contrast, asexual stage inactive gene promoters such as Pfg 27 (gametocyte marker) and Pfs 28 (ookinete marker) occupy H 3 K 9 Ac devoid zones at the nuclear periphery. The histone H 3 K 9 is predominantly acetylated by the PCAF/GCN 5 class of lysine acetyltransferases, which is well characterized in the parasite. Interestingly, embelin, a specific inhibitor of PCAF/GCN 5 family histone acetyltransferase, selectively decreases total H 3 K 9 <b>Ac</b> acetylation <b>levels</b> (but not H 3 K 14 <b>Ac</b> <b>levels)</b> around the var gene promoters, leading to the downregulation of var gene expression, suggesting interplay among histone acetylation status, as well as subnuclear compartmentalization of different genes and their activation in the parasites. Finally, we found that embelin inhibited parasitic growth at the low micromolar range, raising the possibility of using histone acetyltransferases as a target for antimalarial therapy...|$|R
40|$|A five level {{single phase}} {{cascaded}} inverter {{consists of two}} full bridges connected in series on the AC side. Each bridge can create three different voltage <b>levels</b> at its <b>AC</b> output allowing for an overall five <b>level</b> <b>AC</b> output voltage. Due to switch combination redundancies, there are certain degrees of freedom of how to generate the five <b>level</b> <b>AC</b> output voltage.
