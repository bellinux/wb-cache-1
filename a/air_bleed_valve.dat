50|$|Around 3 {{minutes and}} 45 seconds after {{taking off from}} Irkutsk, at an {{altitude}} of 4.000 ft, the engine no 2 suddenly failed. A destruction occurred on the engines air starter that did not shut down after the engine was started and continued to operate at high revs (over 40,000 rpm) with open <b>air</b> <b>bleed</b> <b>valves</b> from the engines. The rotating disk of the turbine then flew from the starter's compartment and entered the engine and compartment area. This ultimately led to the destruction of the left engine's fuel lines. The hydraulic system elements, broke through the rear case of the combustion chamber and left the engine. The fuel supply for the fuel injectors stopped, which led to the ignition of flames on the engine no 2. The engine no 2 burst into flames.|$|R
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{involved in}} the accident was a Beechcraft 200 Super King Air, registration VH-SKC, serial number BB-47, manufactured in 1975. The aircraft had 18,771 hours of service before the accident. The amount of air passed into the cabin is controlled by <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> <b>valves</b> on the engines. The positions of the <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> <b>valves</b> can be altered by the pilot. According to the accident report, [...] "The aircraft was not ﬁtted with a high cabin altitude aural warning device, nor was it required to be." [...] The aircraft was fitted with an emergency oxygen systeman oxygen tank which could supply oxygen to the crew through two masks located in the cockpit and to passengers through masks which drop from {{the ceiling of the}} cabin.|$|R

The Mi-17 can be recognized {{because it has}} the tail rotor {{on the port side}} instead of the starboard side, and dust shields in front of the engine intakes. Engine cowls are shorter than on the TV2-powered Mi-8, not extending as far over the cockpit, and an opening for a <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> outlet is present forward of the exhaust.|$|R
40|$|The Vehicle Integrated Propulsion Research (VIPR) Phase III {{project was}} {{executed}} at Edwards Air Force Base, California, by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and several industry, academic, and government {{partners in the}} summer of 2015. One of the research objectives was to use external radial acoustic microphone arrays to detect changes in the noise characteristics produced by the research engine during volcanic ash ingestion and seeded fault insertion scenarios involving <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> <b>valves.</b> Preliminary results indicate the successful acoustic detection of suspected degradation as a result of cumulative exposure to volcanic ash. This detection is shown through progressive changes, particularly in the high-frequency content, as a function of exposure to greater cumulative quantities of ash. Additionally, detection of the simulated failure of the 14 th stage stability <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> and, to a lesser extent, the station 2. 5 stability <b>bleed</b> <b>valve,</b> to their fully-open fail-safe positions was achieved by means of spectral comparisons between nominal (normal valve operation) and seeded fault scenarios...|$|R
50|$|The 1971 January 22 Surgut Aeroflot Antonov An-12 crash {{occurred}} on 22 January 1971, when an Aeroflot Antonov An-12B, registered CCCP-11000, flying from Omsk Tsentralny Airport, in the Soviet Unions Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic (RSFSR), crashed 15 km {{short of the}} runway on approach to Surgut International Airport, Surgut, RSFSR.

5000|$|Pressurization is {{achieved}} by the design of an airtight fuselage engineered to be pressurized with a source of compressed air and controlled by an environmental control system (ECS). The most common source of compressed air for pressurization is <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> extracted from the compressor stage of a gas turbine engine, from a low or intermediate stage and also from an additional high stage; the exact stage can vary depending on engine type. By the time the cold outside air has reached the <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> <b>valves,</b> it is {{at a very high}} pressure and has been heated to around [...] The control and selection of high or low bleed sources is fully automatic and is governed by the needs of various pneumatic systems at various stages of flight.|$|R
50|$|The {{cause of}} the crash was {{determined}} to be a stall caused by the leading edge slats (strictly speaking, Krueger flaps) having been left in the retracted position. Even though the trailing edge flaps were deployed, without the slats being extended the aircraft's stall speed was higher and the maximum angle of attack was lower. As a result, the aircraft was unable to climb out of ground effect. The flight engineer was found to have failed to open the slat system <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> <b>valves</b> as required on the pre-flight checklist. This prevented <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> from flowing to the 747's pneumatic slat system and, since the leading edge slats on the 747 are pneumatically driven, kept it from deploying the leading edge slats for takeoff. The take-off warning system that would have sounded an alarm due to the flaps not being lowered did not have a separate warning that the slats' pneumatic valve had not been opened by the flight engineer.|$|R
40|$|Oxides of {{nitrogen}} (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and other combustion by-products of gas turbines {{have long been}} identified as harmful atmospheric pollutants {{to the environment and}} humans. Various government agencies place restrictions on emissions and often require some sort of emissions monitoring even for new low emission gas turbines. Predicting actual emissions from operating parameters that affect the formation of pollutants, called parametric emissions monitoring system (PEMS), has potential economic advantages compared to a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS). The problem is that a simple applicable PEMS does not exist. During this study, a gas turbine combustor model applying first engineering principles was developed to predict the emission formation of NOx and CO in a gas turbine. The model is based on a lean-premixed combustor with a main and pilot burner including the function of a <b>bleeding</b> <b>air</b> <b>valve.</b> The model relies on ambient condition and load. The load is expressed {{as a percentage of the}} target speed of the gas producer turbine. Air flow and fuel flow for the main and pilot burner are calculated by the mode...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The current paper {{reports a}} {{numerical}} investigation of stall inception in a transonic compressor rotor, NASA Rotor- 67, {{by using the}} whole flow passages in the computations. Sur-face roughness is added {{to one of the}} blades in order to trigger rotating stall. During stall incep-tion, the tip clearance vortex moved away from the suction surface of the roughened blade’s upper neighbour, leading to vortex breakdown. The stall cell was found to propagate opposite the direction of the blade rotation at about 30 per cent of rotational speed. The effect of <b>air</b> <b>bleeding</b> on stabilizing the compressor is also studied in this work. The mean mass flowrate removed from the <b>bleed</b> <b>valves</b> was 1. 2 per cent of the mainstream flowrate. This amount of bleeding was found to effectively suppress the stalling disturbances...|$|R
50|$|The {{propellant}} <b>bleed</b> <b>valves</b> used in {{both the}} fuel and oxidizer systems were poppet-type, which were spring-loaded to the normally open position and pressure-actuated to the closed position. Both propellant <b>bleed</b> <b>valves</b> were mounted to the bootstrap lines adjacent to their respective turbopump discharge flanges. The valves allowed propellant to circulate in the propellant feed system lines to achieve proper operating temperature prior to engine start, and were engine controlled. At engine start, a helium control solenoid valve in the pneumatic control package was energized allowing pneumatic pressure to close the <b>bleed</b> <b>valves,</b> which remained closed during engine operation.|$|R

The major benefit of this design configuration {{is that the}} valve has the same face-to-face dimension as a single block ball valve (as specified in API 6D and ANSI B16.10), which means the valve can easily be installed into an existing pipeline {{without the need for}} any pipeline re-working.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{operating}} pressure was maintained by an automatically controlled <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> once the plant had reached steady state, the valve {{could not be used}} during start-up, when there was no air feed, the plant being pressurised with nitrogen. During start-up the <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> was normally isolated and there was no route for excess pressure to escape; pressure was kept within acceptable limits (slightly wider that those achieved under automatic control) by operator intervention (manual operation of vent valves). A pressure-relief valve acting at 11 kg/cm2 (156 psi) gauge was also fitted.|$|R
40|$|Active {{control of}} {{rotating}} stall and surge using <b>bleed</b> <b>valves</b> {{has been demonstrated}} on low and high speed compressors using high bandwidth actuators. In this paper we provide a method to reduce the bandwidth and rate requirements for control of rotating stall by combining an axisymmetric <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> with continuous <b>air</b> injection. The addition of the continuous air injection is modeled as a shift of both the stable and unstable parts of the compressor characteristic and serves to reduce the requirement of a <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> used for rotating stall stabilization purpose. The results are demonstrated using a lowspeed, single stage, axial flow compressor. 1. Introduction Rotating stall and surge {{are two types of}} instabilities that occur in the axial flow compressor part of a gas-turbine engine. Rotating stall is a flow separation that travels around the annulus of the compressor (referred to as a stall cell) while surge is a large axial oscillation of the flow.

40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} {{mathematical model}} has been developed for a fully hydrated and isothermal PEM fuel cell. Mass transport in the gas flow channels, electrode backing and catalyst layers is accounted for, along with the adsorption, desorption and electro-oxidation of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Additionally, the heterogeneous catalysis of hydrogen and carbon monoxide with oxygen is included for the simulation of oxygen or <b>air</b> <b>bleeding.</b> The model prediction agrees well with published, experimental data at various temperatures, pressures and carbon monoxide concentrations. Simulations with oxygen and <b>air</b> <b>bleeding</b> indicate that a threshold amount of oxygen or <b>air</b> <b>bleeding</b> exists; any increase {{in the amount of}} bleeding above the threshold amount results in no further mitigation of CO poisoning.

50|$|The air {{pressure}} system on a tire changer provides {{the air to}} inflate tires mounted on wheels. The {{air pressure}} system consists of 4 components: air hose, air inflation gauge, inflation pedal and manual pressure <b>bleed</b> <b>valve.</b> The <b>air</b> hose is located {{near the top of}} the tire changer, and it allows compressed air to travel into the tire. A specialized end is used on the air hose to clamp firmly onto valve stems of the wheels. The air inflation gauge displays the air pressure within the tire when the air hose is connected to the valve stem. The air inflation gauge displays the pressure in pounds per square inch (psi). Directly below the air hose on the side of the tire changer is the inflation pedal that enables the inflation of the tire. When the inflation pedal is raised, a burst of air is released from valves next to each rim clamp toward the bottom bead of the tire to help with inflation. The manual <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> is located next to the air hose and air inflation gauge. The manual <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> allows the manual release of air pressure from tire.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} {{advantages}} in using a Double Block and <b>Bleed</b> <b>Valve.</b> Significantly, {{because all the}} valve components are housed in a single unit, the space required for the installation is dramatically reduced thus freeing up room for other pieces of essential equipment.|$|R

Block and <b>bleed</b> needle <b>valves</b> are used in hydraulic and pneumatic systems because the needle valve allows for precise flow regulation when there is low flow in a non-hazardous environment.|$|R
40|$|Enhancement of polymer {{electrolyte}} {{fuel cell}} tolerance to CO impurities {{would allow the}} use of lower quality hydrogen, thus reducing the costs without compromising fuel cell performance. In this work, the effect of carbon monoxide is mitigated by combining different methods, including <b>air</b> <b>bleed,</b> varying the anode flow rate and using a state-of-the-art Pt-Ru catalyst at two operating temperatures. The tolerance was investigated by feeding a novel arrangement of segmented cells with hydrogen containing carbon monoxide less than 20 ppm. Anode exhaust gas was constantly analysed using a gas chromatograph. It was discovered that increasing the volumetric flow rate of hydrogen and especially utilising ruthenium in the catalyst enhance the carbon monoxide tolerance. When applying the <b>air</b> <b>bleed,</b> an oxygen/CO molar ratio of at least 117 was required to stop the poisoning with a platinum catalyst. Approximately {{a fifth of the}} <b>air</b> <b>bleed</b> needed with platinum was enough with Pt-Ru.
