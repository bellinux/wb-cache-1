5|$|In 2015, Dickinson {{underwent}} {{seven weeks}} of chemotherapy and radiation therapy for a cancerous tumour {{found at the}} back of his tongue. Dickinson's medical team expected him to make <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>recovery</b> as the tumour was discovered in the early stages. On 15 May, Dickinson was given the all-clear by his specialists.|$|E
50|$|He {{had several}} {{surgeries}} to remove floating bone fragments from his distraught left hip, prolonged rehabilitation and a modified training regime to make <b>an</b> apparent <b>full</b> <b>recovery.</b> He was elevated to senior level in 2005, and ranked {{as the second}} fastest Bomber over 20m in pre-season testing.|$|R
50|$|In June 2017, a {{vulnerability}} (CVE-2017-7526) {{was discovered}} in libgcrypt, a library used by GnuPG, which enabled <b>a</b> <b>full</b> key <b>recovery</b> for RSA-1024 and 1/8th of RSA-2048 keys. This side-channel attack exploits the fact that Libgcrypt used a sliding windows method for exponentiation which leads to the leakage of exponent bits and to <b>full</b> key <b>recovery.</b>|$|R
50|$|In August 1936, young Drew was accidentally shot while fly-fishing with {{a friend}} on Dorcheat Bayou west of Minden. The wound {{required}} <b>an</b> operation for <b>full</b> <b>recovery.</b>|$|R

5|$|During this period, Thordendal, who {{was working}} as a carpenter, severed the tip of his left middle finger, while Haake injured his hand in a router accident. As a result, the band was unable to perform for several months. Thordendal's {{fingertip}} was later reattached, and he went on to make <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>recovery.</b> The Selfcaged EP was recorded in April and May 1994, but its release was delayed to later in 1995 due to the accidents.|$|E
50|$|This {{is where}} a regular {{character}} on a television series obtains a temporary disability, learns a moral lesson, and makes <b>a</b> rapid, <b>full</b> <b>recovery.</b> Examples include <b>an</b> episode of M*A*S*H where Hawkeye is temporarily blinded, and an episode of Law and Order: SVU where Detective Stabler is temporarily blind.|$|R
40|$|The paper aims to {{identify}} the most appropriate method of Public Private Partnership (PPP) suitable for provision of water services to Maldives rural community {{and the extent to}} which rural community is prepared for <b>a</b> <b>full</b> cost <b>recovery</b> service provision system. The result of the study shows that there are many barriers for privatization of water services in Maldives rural islands. Therefore, it is vital to have a strategic plan which is phased out into stages. Such as, among others first to conduct awareness programs to make community aware that sustainable water services can only be provided by having <b>a</b> <b>full</b> cost <b>recovery</b> water provision, institution building and to introduce proper water regulatory system...|$|R
30|$|Our patient made <b>a</b> <b>full</b> visual <b>recovery,</b> but {{was found}} to have {{extensive}} T 2 /FLAIR foci of hyperintensities that enhanced and had restricted diffusion on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Six months later, these demyelinating lesions still persisted and our patient was initiated on immunomodulatory treatment.|$|R
5|$|Except {{for being}} {{left with a}} lifelong facial tick, Howe made <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>recovery</b> and for the 1950–51 season as he {{finished}} the season leading the league in points.

In {{the first round of}} the playoffs Montreal upset Detroit and Toronto defeated Boston.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} allow for <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>recovery</b> of the New Orleans market {{in the wake of}} the storm, the NBA {{announced}} on January 31, 2006, that the Hornets would remain in Oklahoma City for the 2006–07 season and return for the 2007–08 season. The league also announced that New Orleans would play host for the 2008 All-Star Game, in addition to hosting the team for six of their 41 home games during the season.|$|E
5|$|Later, Scully and Mulder meet Doggett, who has now fully recovered, at the hospital.

25|$|Following an {{assassination}} attempt in late 2004 during his election campaign, Yushchenko was confirmed to have ingested hazardous amounts of TCDD, the most potent dioxin and a contaminant in Agent Orange. He suffered disfigurement {{as a result of}} the poisoning, but has since made <b>a</b> <b>full</b> physical <b>recovery.</b>|$|R
5|$|Solomon Taylor {{ordered the}} group of locals not to fire. It is unclear which group fired first, but three shots were heard, one of which hit Lieutenant Robinson. When the deserters fled the scene the Lincoln Midnight Riders chased them {{approximately}} a quarter mile before turning back. The shooting was mentioned in the Columbia Democrat which also wished Robinson <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>recovery.</b> Robinson died from peritonitis on November 3, 1864.|$|E
5|$|Children {{are less}} likely than adults to clear the infection. More than 95% of people who become {{infected}} as adults or older children will stage <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>recovery</b> and develop protective immunity to the virus. However, this drops to 30% for younger children, and only 5% of newborns that acquire the infection from their mother at birth will clear the infection. This population has a 40% lifetime risk of death from cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Of those infected between the age of one to six, 70% will clear the infection.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{life-threatening}} drug addiction that developed {{after leaving the}} Chili Peppers in 1992, Frusciante made <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>recovery</b> after a month of drug rehabilitation during {{the early months of}} 1998. Shortly thereafter he was asked to rejoin the Red Hot Chili Peppers. After several months of writing and recording, the Chili Peppers' next album, Californication was released. The album went on to sell more than 15 million copies worldwide, becoming the Chili Peppers' most successful recording to date. Frusciante's return generated much response from critics, who recognized the album as a commercial revitalization from their previous record, One Hot Minute. A two-year-long, international tour followed, which included several festival appearances, including Woodstock 1999 and Rock in Rio.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{complexities}} of government intervention design in the waste realm are addressed. More specifically, we compare two waste tax regimes (optimal and <b>full</b> cost <b>recovery),</b> allowing for the possible presence of criminal organizations in the waste cycle. Our main conclusions suggest that <b>a</b> <b>full</b> cost <b>recovery</b> tax reacts less than an optimal tax to changes in enforcement, and that higher illegal disposal and larger entry incentives for the mafia may result under <b>full</b> cost <b>recovery.</b> Finally, we illustrate a case under which the <b>full</b> cost <b>recovery</b> equilibrium is closer to first best when the mafia is present...|$|R
25|$|Another {{plane crashed}} on April 13, 2004, shortly after leaving Buchanan Field. The plane {{landed on a}} minivan {{traveling}} down nearby Interstate 680 in Pleasant Hill and nearly severed the left leg of a 12-year-old girl (Her leg was successfully reattached and she has made <b>a</b> near <b>full</b> <b>recovery).</b> Officials determined the crash was the fault of a mechanic who had worked on the plane.|$|R
5|$|From July 30 – September 2, 2007, {{the band}} went {{on their first}} major tour cycle {{as one of the}} {{supporting}} acts on Korn's Family Values Tour. They were also a supporting act of the North American leg of Korn's Bitch We Have a Problem Tour from September 22 – October 27, 2007. They were set to tour with Chimaira and All That Remains from January through March 2008, but due to singer Moody developing cysts on his vocal cords they were forced to pull out. He made <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>recovery</b> and they began to tour again. They supported Disturbed on their Indestructible US Tour from April through May 2008.|$|E
5|$|Generally, if {{the patient}} is treated and survives then <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>recovery</b> is expected. Patients who present early to medical {{facilities}} and have prompt medical treatment typically will have a favorable outcome. Alternatively, patients presenting late with {{signs and symptoms of}} coma, hyperkalemia, seizures, or severe acidosis have a poor prognosis. Patients who develop severe central nervous system manifestations or stroke who survive may have long term neurologic dysfunction; in some cases they may recover, although convalescence may be prolonged. The most significant long-term complication is related to the kidneys. Cases of permanent kidney damage, often requiring chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation, have been reported after severe poisoning.|$|E
5|$|In 1788, Tarrare {{moved to}} Paris {{to work as}} a street performer. He appears to have been {{successful}} in general, but on one occasion the act went wrong and he suffered severe intestinal obstruction. Members of the crowd carried him to the Hôtel-Dieu hospital, where he was treated with powerful laxatives. He made <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>recovery</b> and offered to demonstrate his act by eating his surgeon's watch and chain; M.Giraud, the surgeon, was unimpressed by the offer and warned him that if he did so, he would cut Tarrare open to recover the items.|$|E

30|$|<b>A</b> cell <b>full</b> <b>recovery</b> {{mechanism}} must be {{a complex}} process that has to overcome irreversible caspase-dependent cleavage of substrates through restraining caspase- 3 catalytic activity. This function is played by inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) and proteasome-dependent caspase degradation (Albeck et al., 2008). Our data identify Apaf 1 as a molecule that {{should be included in}} light of its role, when chemically inhibited, as a molecule participating in the process.|$|R
5|$|In 1983, Reynolds {{fell ill}} with {{multiple}} myeloma, {{a type of}} blood cancer that often attacks the bones, {{and was forced to}} stop anchoring in April. His absence caused a dip in the ratings for ABC's nightly newscast. ABC originally expected <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>recovery,</b> and relocated Jennings to its Washington bureau to fill in for Reynolds while he was sick; the move helped buoy the newscast's ratings, though it remained in third place. On July 20, 1983, Reynolds died unexpectedly after developing acute hepatitis.|$|E
5|$|In December 2012 Clinton {{was hospitalized}} {{for a few}} days for {{treatment}} of a blood clot in her right transverse venous sinus. Her doctors had discovered the clot during a follow-up examination for a concussion she had sustained when she fainted and fell nearly three weeks earlier, as a result of severe dehydration from a viral intestinal ailment acquired during a trip to Europe. The clot, which caused no immediate neurological injury, was treated with anticoagulant medication and her doctors have said she has made <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>recovery.</b>|$|E
5|$|In late 1996, {{after more}} than five years of {{addiction}} to heroin, Frusciante quit it cold turkey. However, months later he was still unable to break addictions to crack cocaine and alcohol. In January 1998, urged by longtime friend Bob Forrest, Frusciante checked into Las Encinas, a drug rehabilitation clinic in Pasadena, to begin <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>recovery.</b> Upon arrival, he was diagnosed with a potentially lethal oral infection, which could only be alleviated by removing all of his rotten teeth and replacing them with dental implants. He also received skin grafts to help repair the abscesses on his ravaged arms. About a month later, Frusciante checked out of Las Encinas and re-entered society.|$|E
50|$|Manley {{underwent}} 15 {{hours of}} brain surgery June 21, 2006, {{to treat a}} Colloid cyst, and is experiencing minor isolated memory loss. He first learned about the cyst in 1986, after he collapsed in a Georgetown department store. His prognosis is for <b>a</b> relatively <b>full</b> <b>recovery,</b> although doctors have said that memory loss is a common side effect of the operation. Manley lives in suburban Washington {{with his wife and}} family.|$|R
50|$|It is {{extremely}} rare for any significant motor function to return. The majority of locked-in syndrome patients do not regain motor control, but devices {{are available to}} help patients communicate. However, some people with the condition continue to live much longer, while in exceptional cases, like that of Kerry Pink and Kate Allatt, <b>a</b> <b>full</b> spontaneous <b>recovery</b> may be achieved.|$|R
