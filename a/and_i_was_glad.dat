500|$|Early on, I {{realized}} {{that what this}} particular crew needed from me was not pressure but the light touch. [...] Once informed of our objective, their enthusiasm infected everything they did, and here and there might easily have caused stress-related dysfunction. [...] Extended separation from home and family with no means of communications {{was not a problem}} — submariners are used to that — but bearing down too much on the job might be. [...] My concern was about our performance in an emergency, being at the same time unable to predict what emergencies might be in store for us. [...] It was important, I thought, to hold back on the pressure until a really tough problem came up. [...] This happened several times, as I knew it would, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> I had something in reserve.|$|E
500|$|Also in 2004, Beckinsale portrayed Ava Gardner in Martin Scorsese's Howard Hughes biopic The Aviator. Scorsese {{decided to}} cast Beckinsale because, [...] "I’ve always liked her. I’ve seen all her work, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> that {{she agreed to}} audition." [...] Beckinsale's {{performance}} received mixed reviews. Ken Tucker of New York Magazine said she played the part [...] "in full va-va-voom blossom" [...] while LaSalle felt that she manages [...] "to convince us that Ava {{was one of the}} great broads of all time." [...] However, Clark described it as [...] "the one performance that doesn't come off (though Beckinsale has the requisite beauty)" [...] while Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian stated that [...] "Gardner's rich, voluptuous sexiness is completely absent as Beckinsale sleepwalks through the role as if she was advertising perfume." [...] The film grossed over $213million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|The project caused {{division}} in Blink-182, mostly between DeLonge and Hoppus. Hoppus {{was interested in}} {{being a part of}} the record, but DeLonge did not want it to turn into a Blink-182 album. DeLonge contended that the involvement of Barker was to refrain from having to pay a session musician. Regardless, Hoppus felt betrayed and unresolved tension dogged the band until their 2005 breakup. [...] "Nobody talked about it. It was this strange situation that nobody addressed," [...] DeLonge told Blender. Barker felt guilty when he told Hoppus they were going to tour in support of the album: [...] "I felt like I had let him down [...] but he was ultimately more upset at Tom because they had ten years of history together before me." [...] Despite this tension, Hoppus lent vocals to the track [...] "Elevator" [...] and shared early ideas for the next Blink-182 album. In a later Reddit AMA, Hoppus concluded, [...] "The whole situation sucked. But I sang on the track because, at the heart of it, Tom and Travis are my friends. I'm sure Tom felt the tension and asked me as an offering. I was glad to have done it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> that he asked." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the second}} day, Collingwood {{completed}} his century, falling for 129 when Durham were 229 for 4. The last six Durham wickets then added 57 {{to leave them}} with a lead of 115. Liam Plunkett, who had taken eight wickets {{in the first game}} but conceded 55 runs for no wicket in the first innings in this second game, then returned to knock out three top-order wickets. The rest of the bowling unit performed well, and Steve Harmison took a hat-trick on his way to five for 61. Harmison later said, [...] "The way I was feeling, my tail was up and I felt I could go through them. The position they were in I don’t think they were too keen to hang around. Before the last ball , I felt confident. It was a decent ball in a decent area <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> when he [...] chopped it on." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “When I saw {{the great}} White Chief I {{thought he was}} a great man. [...] When I heard him speak, then I felt sure he was a great man. [...] But the White Chief is not as the big men in out tribes. [...] He wore no plumes and no decorations. [...] He had none of his young men (warriors) with him, and only that I heard him talk he would have been to me as other white men. [...] But my brother Mr. Gladstone came to see me in my lodge as a friend, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> to see the White Chief, for though my tongue was tied in his {{presence}} my heart was in full friendship. [...] After he went away they told me that half of his great nation of white men have adopted him as their chief. [...] If he were not both good and wise, so many young men of his nation would have never taken him for their leader.” ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the second}} day, Collingwood {{completed}} his century, finally falling for 129 when Durham were 229 for 4. The Durham tail did not {{back up the}} start given {{to them by the}} specialist batsmen, however, and they were all out for 286, a lead of 115. Liam Plunkett, who had a good first game but a quiet first innings in this second game, then returned to knock out three top-order wickets. The rest of the bowling unit performed well, and Steve Harmison took a hat-trick on his way to 5 for 61. Harmison later said, [...] "The way I was feeling, my tail was up and I felt I could go through them. The position they were in I don’t think they were too keen to hang around.

2500|$|Early {{commentators}} such as Vasari and André Félibien {{praised the}} picture for its realism, but by the Victorian era writers began to regard the Mona Lisa as imbued {{with a sense of}} mystery and romance. [...] In 1859 Théophile Gautier wrote that the Mona Lisa was a [...] "sphinx of beauty who smiles so mysteriously" [...] and that [...] "Beneath the form expressed one feels a thought that is vague, infinite, inexpressible. One is moved, troubled ... repressed desires, hopes that drive one to despair, stir painfully." [...] Walter Pater's famous essay of 1869 described the sitter as [...] "older than the rocks among which she sits; like the vampire, she has been dead many times, and learned the secrets of the grave; and has been a diver in the deep seas, and keeps their fallen day about her." [...] By the early 20thcentury some critics started to feel the painting had become a repository for subjective exegeses and theories, and upon the painting's theft in 1911, Renaissance historian Bernard Berenson admitted that it had [...] "simply become an incubus, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> to be rid of her." ...|$|E
