40|$|Finally in Figure 6 we {{vary the}} <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>depreciation</b> in the X sector. The key role of this {{parameter}} is in affecting the desired capital {{stock in the}} X sector following reform since a very low <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>depreciation</b> for example would mean that if the X sector has expanded it will suffer a prolonged period of low returns if reversal occurs since the sectoral capital stock will depreciate (and thereby raise the return to capital) only slowly. Hence a low <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>depreciation</b> will tend to discourage investment in the X sector more for a given probability and size of reversal. This may {{be seen from the}} upper charts of Figure 6 though the effect is weak compared with varying the tariff rate and reversal probability above until the depreciation rate is very small. It would be important, however, for developing countries in which the export sector comprises agricultural commodities since both tree crops (the planting of which may be considered investment due to the lags involved) and agricultural investments to facilitate the production of annual crops (land improvement, drainage etc.) have low <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>depreciation.</b> Mining investments also have low depreciation rates though they are also often capital intensive which makes the model above less applicable since the export sector is affected by trade reform through the labour market. 16 3.

The estimation method is simple and operational, and consistently generates sensible results.
