5|$|By {{the early}} 1590s, Lopez was wealthy and {{generally}} respected. He owned a comfortable house in Holborn {{and had his}} youngest son Anthony enrolled at Winchester College. He incurred the fury {{of one of his}} former patients, Queen Elizabeth's favourite Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, when he described to Dom António and the Spanish statesman Antonio Pérez occasions on which he had treated Essex for venereal diseases. Learning of this from Pérez, Essex began to assemble evidence implicating Lopez <b>as</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> fifth columnist in the pay of King Philip II of Spain. The Lord High Treasurer Lord Burghley initially thought Essex's allegations against Lopez absurd; the Queen herself also rebuked Essex.|$|E
5|$|Keith Park, with {{endorsement}} from Dowding, {{opted for}} the opposite strategy. Park maintained that it was unimportant to inflict large losses on the Germans in comparison to safeguarding his own forces. Park believed the Germans would give up if they could not achieve their aim of air superiority. This, simply put, meant avoiding the destruction and or depletion of Fighter Command was the primary factor in air defence. This would be achieved by sending small numbers of fighters to intercept, minimising losses in the air. By remaining to offer undiminished and constant air opposition, the RAF ensured the Luftwaffe could not win. As long <b>as</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> cost was imposed before the enemy dropped his bombs and impaired the defence system, the RAF could remain intact to meet the threat again the next day. To this end, Park favoured the 10 bomber kills before the attack, rather than the 50 shot down after it. The strategy suggested an enemy would give up if {{he felt he was}} getting nowhere. For even while his losses remained moderate, it would be senseless to suffer those casualties for no return. Park and Dowding's strategy, under the circumstances, was the wiser choice.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} issues that remains to be fully addressed in existing multimodal evolutionary algorithms is the difficulty in pre-specifying parameters used for estimating how far apart optima are. These parameters are typically represented <b>as</b> <b>some</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> niching parameters in existing EAs. Without prior knowledge of a problem, {{it is almost impossible to}} determine appropriate values for such niching parameters. This paper proposes a PSO for multimodal optimization that removes the need of these niching parameters. Our results show that the proposed algorithm, Fitness Euclidean-distance Ratio based PSO (FER-PSO) is able to reliably locate multiple global optima on the search landscape over some widely used multimodal optimization test functions, given that the population size is sufficiently large...|$|R

25|$|Today modern Egyptologists {{evaluate}} Herodotus's and Diodorus's stories <b>as</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> defamation, {{based on}} both author's contemporary philosophy.

This extremely negative picture was obviously projected onto Khafra and his daunting pyramid. The view was possibly promoted by the fact, that during Khafra's lifetime {{the permission of the}} creation of oversized statues made of precious stone and their displaying at open places in public was limited to the king only.

These views and resulting stories were avidly snapped up by the Greek historians and so they made their also negative evaluations about Khafra, since scandalous stories were easier to sell to the public than positive (and therefore boring) tales.|$|E
25|$|Today Egyptologists {{evaluate}} Herodotus's and Diodorus's stories <b>as</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> defamation, {{based on}} both authors' contemporary philosophy.

Additionally the Egyptologists point out that the philosophies of the ancient Egyptians had completely changed since the Old Kingdom. Oversized tombs such as the Giza pyramids must have appalled the Greeks and even the later priests of the New Kingdom, because they surely remembered the heretic pharaoh Akhenaten and his megalomaniac building projects.

Travis Estvold of Boise Weekly wrote that she was [...] "horribly miscast <b>as</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> undersized, warble-voiced crime boss".

One of the basic problems investigated in the field is the solvability (see, e.g., [32 – 36] for widely known methods). For some recent results, see, e.g., [2, 10, 14, 16 – 24, 26 – 31]. Recently several papers presenting formulas for solutions to some difference equations and systems, but without mentioning any theory, have appeared. A theoretical explanation of formulas for such an equation given in our note [14] has attracted some attention. The note shows that the equation is closely related to a known solvable one, and the main idea has been used and developed later in many papers (see, for example, [2, 10, 16, 21, 26, 27] and the references therein).|$|R
