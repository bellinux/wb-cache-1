5|$|Agricultural and {{forestry}} work were the traditional {{uses of the}} Finnhorse. The Finnhorse was never bred to be a particularly large or heavy draught horse, {{as it was the}} only horse breed of the country, and versatility was desired as the Finnhorse was also used as the primary steed of the cavalry. The climate and conditions of Finland necessitated that the breed be durable and hardy. As a result, the Finnhorse remained small but tough, and could pull heavy loads in difficult terrain <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> chest-deep snow. Relative to its size, the Finnhorse is among the most powerful workhorses in the world with the best animals able to pull as much as 200percent of their own weight.|$|E

5|$|Bonstelle's mother, who {{herself had}} wanted to be an actress, home-schooled her in reading, writing, singing, dancing, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> reciting Shakespeare. Jessie's first public {{performance}} was singing temperance songs in church at the age of two years. Helen gave her daughter a passion for acting by often taking her to theaters in nearby Rochester. Around the age of ten Jessie auditioned for critic Thomas Keane, and with his encouragement she left on tour with a production of Bertha, the Beautiful Sewing Machine Girl, a melodrama. After returning home from California she briefly studied at Nazareth Academy, a convent school in Rochester. In 1886 she returned to the stage, working for local opera house owner Edward D. Stair and touring in his productions.|$|E
5|$|He {{achieved}} {{his greatest}} international success with Mephisto (1981), {{which won the}} Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Since then, most of Szabó's films have been international co-productions filmed {{in a variety of}} languages and European locations. He has continued to make some films in Hungarian, however, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> his international co-productions, he often films in Hungary and uses Hungarian talent. Szabó became involved in a national controversy in 2006 when the Hungarian newspaper Life and Literature revealed that he had been an informant of the Communist regime’s secret police.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle Ages the town, {{which was}} now known as Manceastre (later to become Manchester), grew and prospered, and trading vessels plied along the river. The hamlet of Kersal, which now forms part of the City of Salford, was gifted to the Cluniac Priory of Lenton, near Nottingham, in 1142. The most {{important}} part of the gift was the fishing rights on the River Irwell, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> the 18th century, the salmon rights on the rivers of Lancashire were let every year for many hundreds of pounds.|$|E

5|$|In {{the western}} churches, the mitre was placed above the shield of all persons who were {{entitled}} to wear the mitre, including abbots. It substituted for the helmet of military arms, but also appeared as a crest placed atop a helmet, as was common in German heraldry. In the Anglican Churches, the mitre is still placed above the arms of bishops and not an ecclesiastical hat. In the Roman Catholic Church, {{the use of the}} mitre above the shield on the personal arms of clergy was suppressed in 1969, and is now found only on some corporate arms, like those of dioceses. Previously, the mitre was often included under the hat, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> the arms of a cardinal, the mitre was not entirely displaced.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April 1944, Mickl was {{promoted}} to Generalleutnant. He identified that the Partisan 13th Division was using the Drežnica valley as a huge armoury, hiding captured Italian arms and ammunition in villages, basements, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> fake graves in cemeteries. This was of major concern if the feared Allied landing eventuated. In mid-April, Mickl ordered Operation Keulenschlag (Mace Blow) to clear the area, using the 846th Infantry Regiment {{and parts of the}} 847th Infantry Regiment, supported by the divisional artillery and flak battalion. Over the next two weeks, the division pushed the Partisan 13th Division north to the area of Mrkopalj and Delnice, and captured sufficient material to equip two divisions, including 30 tons of small arms ammunition and 15 tons of artillery ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Polish music, {{including}} orchestras, {{also went}} underground. Top Polish musicians and directors (Adam Didur, Zbigniew Drzewiecki, Jan Ekier, Barbara Kostrzewska, Zygmunt Latoszewski, Jerzy Lefeld, Witold Lutosławski, Andrzej Panufnik, Piotr Perkowski, Edmund Rudnicki, Eugenia Umińska, Jerzy Waldorff, Kazimierz Wiłkomirski, Maria Wiłkomirska, Bolesław Woytowicz, Mira Zimińska) performed in restaurants, cafes, and private homes, {{with the most}} daring singing patriotic ballads on the streets while evading German patrols. Patriotic songs were written, such as Siekiera, motyka, the most popular song of occupied Warsaw. Patriotic puppet shows were staged. Jewish musicians (e.g. Władysław Szpilman) and artists likewise performed in ghettos <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> concentration camps. Although many of them died, some survived abroad, like Alexandre Tansman in the United States, and Eddie Rosner and Henryk Wars in the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|Since common {{starlings}} eat {{insect pests}} such as wireworms, {{they are considered}} beneficial in northern Eurasia, {{and this was one}} of the reasons given for introducing the birds elsewhere. Around 25million nest boxes were erected for this species in the former Soviet Union, and common starlings were found to be effective in controlling the grass grub Costelytra zelandica in New Zealand. The original Australian introduction was facilitated by the provision of nest boxes to help this mainly insectivorous bird to breed successfully, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> the US, where this is a pest species, the Department of Agriculture acknowledges that vast numbers of insects are consumed by common starlings.|$|E
5|$|The prince {{began to}} be {{perceived}} as a unifier towards the middle of the 19th century. Such an interpretation is completely lacking in the historiography of the 17th-century chroniclers, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> that of the Transylvanian School around 1800. What they emphasized, apart from the exceptional personality of Michael himself, were the idea of Christendom and his close relations with Emperor Rudolf. The conqueror's ambition is likewise frequently cited as a motivation for his action, occupying in the interpretative schema the place that was later to be occupied by the Romanian idea.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that those net-men wearing tunics, known as retiarii tunicati, formed a special sub-class, one even more demeaned than their loincloth-wearing colleagues. The Roman satirist Juvenal wrote that: So even the lanista's establishment is better ordered than yours, for he separates the vile from the decent, and sequesters even from their fellow-retiarii the wearers of the ill-famed tunic; in the training-school, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> gaol, such creatures herd apart….|$|E

5|$|Wilderness is {{generally}} defined as {{areas that have}} not been significantly modified by human activity. Wilderness areas can be found in preserves, estates, farms, conservation preserves, ranches, , national parks, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> urban areas along rivers, gulches, or otherwise undeveloped areas. Wilderness areas and protected parks are considered important for the survival of certain species, ecological studies, conservation, solitude, and recreation. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity, and some ecologists consider wilderness areas to {{be an integral part of}} the Earth's self-sustaining natural ecosystem (the biosphere). They may also preserve historic genetic traits and that they provide habitat for wild flora and fauna that may be difficult to recreate in zoos, arboretums, or laboratories.|$|E
5|$|After {{turning down}} offers from IBM and the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Segrè {{returned}} to Berkeley in 1952. He {{moved his family}} from Berkeley to nearby Lafayette, California, in 1955. Working with Chamberlain and others, he began searching for the antiproton, a subatomic antiparticle of the proton. The antiparticle of the electron, the positron had been predicted by Paul Dirac in 1931 and then discovered by Carl D. Anderson in 1932. By analogy, it was now expected {{that there would be}} an antiparticle corresponding to the proton, but no one had found one, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> 1955 some scientists doubted that they existed. Using Lawrence's Bevatron set to 6GeV, they managed to detect conclusive evidence of antiprotons. Chamberlain and Segrè were awarded the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery. This was controversial, because Clyde Wiegand and Thomas Ypsilantis were co-authors of the same article, but did not share the prize.|$|E
5|$|As the British {{came within}} range, the American riflemen opened fire. The American riflemen took {{cover in the}} woods, ravines <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> bends in the road, and each time the British would line up in a battle line, the riflemen would fall back and fire from cover. After Hand was forced to abandon the American {{position}} along Five Mile Run, he took up a new position, a heavily wooded area on the south bank of Shabakunk Creek. Hand deployed his men in the trees where they were so well protected from view that the British could not see them as they crossed the bridge over the stream. The riflemen fired at them from point-blank range. The intense fire confused the British into thinking that the entire American army was up against them and they formed into battle lines, bringing up their cannon. The British searched the woods for {{a half an hour}} looking for the Americans, but Hand had already withdrawn to a new position.|$|E
