5|$|The west-facing {{front of}} the {{original}} building consists of three bays with a central door. <b>Above</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is an oculus window that originally had glazing bars, with other windows on both sides that have segmented arched heads and timber sills. The original upper floor windows have been replaced in the 19th or 20th century while the ground floor windows are modern but within the original openings.|$|E
5|$|After Anne Hyde's death, a {{portrait}} of her painted by Willem Wissing was commissioned by the future Mary II; this used to hang <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the Queen's Drawing Room of the Garden House at Windsor Castle. Two years {{after the death of}} his first wife, James married a Catholic princess, Mary of Modena, who bore James Francis Edward, James' only son to survive to adulthood. James became king of England, Ireland, and Scotland in 1685, but was deposed during the Glorious Revolution of 1688. The throne was then offered by Parliament to Anne's eldest daughter Mary and her husband William III of Orange. After Mary died in 1694 and William in 1702, Anne Hyde's daughter Anne became queen of the three kingdoms and, in 1707, the first sovereign of the united Kingdom of Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|St Mary's {{is built}} of ashlar buff and red {{sandstone}} quarried locally at Alderley Edge, and {{the roof is}} of Kerridge stone slates. Its plan consists of a tower at the west end, a four-bay nave with north and south aisles, a chancel with a vestry to its north, and a south porch. Over the north aisle is a dormer window. The tower has diagonal buttresses. Its west door has 14th-century mouldings and <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is a three-light window. The stage above this contains ringers' windows on {{the north and west}} faces and a diamond-shaped clock on the south face. Above these the belfry windows on all faces have two lights. The top of the tower is embattled and contains the bases of eight pinnacles. Below the parapet is a string course with large grotesque gargoyles. At the west end of the nave roof is a bellcote. The Stanley pew projects to the east of the south porch. In the porch are grooves which were cut where arrows were sharpened.|$|E

5|$|The main {{entrance}} {{is at the}} south end of the church at the top of some stone steps on either side. A window (shaped, like all the others in the church, like a star) set in mosaic is positioned <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and there is a stone cross at the top of the facade. The concrete of the church is dressed with stone on the south side, nearest the main road. The ribs on the outside are visible inside the building; in between them, there are patterns of lights and coloured marble panels on the lower parts of the interior walls. The vestry is to the rear of the church, and there is a parish hall, built from masonry, underneath the church. The altar was replaced in 1995 and again on the reopening of the church in 2011, when a carved crucifix, which was brought to Amlwch from a former convent in Liverpool, was also dedicated. The porch houses a sepulchral slab, dating from the latter half of the 13th century.|$|E
5|$|The theatre, {{along with}} the {{neighbouring}} Garrick's Head public house, is a Grade II* listed building and is considered {{a prime example of}} Georgian architecture. The oldest part of the building is the former Garrick's Head on St John's Close. The three storey five bay building, with a basement, has a hipped roof with a part-balustraded parapet. <b>Above</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is a bust of David Garrick, which was made in 1831 by Lucius Gahagan. The Beauford Square side of the building, originally designed by George Dance the Younger, is of five bays with pilasters carrying a frieze of comic and tragic muses. The central door was the main entrance for the pit and galleries. The east front, now the main entrance which opens onto Sawclose, was altered from a plain six-bay entrance by the addition of the round-arched foyer hiding four of the original bays. The 900 seat auditorium has tiers of ornate plasterwork, with red and gilt decoration, and a trompe-l'œil ceiling and glittering chandelier. It has three galleries in a horseshoe plan, supported by cast iron pillars.|$|E
5|$|The pediments, metopes, and {{shield of}} the Parthenos all {{illustrate}} the mythological past {{and as the}} deities are observing on the east frieze, it is natural to reach for a mythological explanation. Chrysoula Kardara, has ventured that the relief shows us the first Panathenaic procession instituted under the mythical King Kekrops. This explanation would account {{for the absence of}} the allies and the ship, as these post-date the original practice of the sacrificial rite. In evidence she offers E35 as the future King Erichthonios presenting the first peplos to his predecessor Kekrops, iconographically similar to the boy’s depiction on a fragmentary kylix of the 450s. A recent interpretation by Joan Breton Connelly identifies the central scene on the east frieze (hence <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to the cella and focal point of the procession) not as the handing over of Athena’s peplos by the arrhephoroi, but the donning of sacrificial garb by the daughter of King Erechtheus in preparation for the sacrifice of her life. An interpretation suggested by the text of the fragmentary papyrus remains of Euripides’s Erichtheus, wherein her life is demanded in order to save the city from Eumolpos and the Eleusinians. Thus, the deities turn their backs to prevent pollution from the sight of her death. A contentious subject in the field, Connelly's {{solution to the problem of}} meaning poses as many problems as it answers.|$|E

25|$|The {{coat of arms}} shows a red {{plate on}} which stands a castle with twin towers. Those towers are crowned with three crenelations. The towers include an open door; <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> the red-white-red shield of Austria is attached.|$|E
25|$|Most {{doors are}} hinged {{along one side}} to allow the door to pivot away from the doorway in one direction, but not the other. The axis of {{rotation}} is usually vertical. In some cases, such as hinged garage doors, the axis may be horizontal, <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> opening.|$|E
25|$|The Stone Store, {{a former}} storehouse, {{is the oldest}} stone {{building}} in New Zealand, construction having begun on 19 April 1832. The keystone <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> bearing the date 1833 {{is thought to have}} been carved by the stonemason William Parrott who cut the Sydney sandstone in situ, but construction of the building was not actually completed until mid-1836.|$|E

25|$|The {{front of}} the house faces north. There are steps up to the front door which is flanked by a pair of white columns. The {{architectural}} academic, John Gifford, writing of the house in the Fife volume of The Buildings of Scotland, describes the doorcase as being modelled on The Tower of the Winds in Athens. <b>Above</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is a semicircular fanlight; the columns support a heavy entablature.|$|E
25|$|The three nephews who {{had risen}} to {{prominence}} under their uncle Pope Urban VIII, cardinals Antonio and Francesco and Prince Taddeo were forced into exile and fled to Paris {{under the protection of}} Cardinal Mazarin. Antonio and Taddeo left first, by sea, but not before hanging the French coat of arms <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the Palazzo Barberini to confirm they were under the protection of France. Francesco joined his brothers soon after.|$|E
25|$|Remnants of the {{old church}} were {{incorporated}} in the new. The arch of the original Saxon south door was reset in the north wall, surrounding a 13th-century grave-slab. The jambs and arch are undecorated and unmoulded, but outside these are three half-shafts and half-rolls, above which are plain slabs as capitals. <b>Above</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is a stone bearing the date 1635, when the old church was restored, {{and the names of}} the two then churchwardens.|$|E

25|$|In the {{renovation}} of the 1980s Quinlan Terry introduced large Doric order columns to this room in the door surrounds and designed a very large Palladian overmantel for the fireplace with small double Doric columns on each side with the royal arms above. Terry also added an ornate gilded ceiling to give the rooms a more stately look. Carved into the plasterwork <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> leading to the Pillared Room {{is a tribute to}} Margaret Thatcher: a straw-carrying 'thatcher'.|$|E
25|$|Just off Henderson Street, on Parliament Street, {{is another}} example of Simpson's work: a Model Lodging House, which was built in 1893 with the aim of {{providing}} cheap, clean, overnight accommodation to transient workers in the area. It is still used to provide temporary accommodation by Canmore Housing Association (ii). A plaque <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of this substantial building commemorates its purpose and those involved in its erection. The Model Lodging House has been C Listed since 1995.|$|E
25|$|<b>Above</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{of these}} {{quarters}} is a stone with the initials of Patrick Houston of Drummaston {{and his wife}} Margaret Gordon, together with the likely date of construction, 1674. This stone has been moved from the old entrance door of the main building. The angle turrets {{on the second floor}} are carried on three plain corbels and do not show at all in the inside of the building. A Gothic-style porch was once attached to the Drumelan burn side of the castle.|$|E

25|$|The {{site was}} a terrace {{enclosed}} {{by a wall}} 30 x 40m. The wall is now almost completely destroyed. The oldest surviving structure is a small chapel located at {{the eastern end of}} the compound. According to an inscription <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> it was built in 1424 by prince Hodja Stephanos Shemsedli (Khoja Stepanos Shemsedin). The chapel has reused khachkars in its walls. The original complex included a zhamatun, fountain known as the milk fountain, a tower, the mentioned chapel, and an arcaded monastic building.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{signs were}} often not painted but consisted, for example, of paraphernalia {{connected with the}} brewing process such as bunches of hops or brewing implements, which were suspended <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the pub. In some cases local nicknames, farming terms and puns were used. Local events were often commemorated in pub signs. Simple natural or religious symbols such as 'The Sun', 'The Star' and 'The Cross' were incorporated into pub signs, sometimes being adapted to incorporate elements of the heraldry (e.g. the coat of arms) of the local lords who owned the lands upon which the pub stood. Some pubs have Latin inscriptions.|$|E
25|$|The first {{train in}} the United Kingdom with {{corridor}} connections between all carriages entered service on 7 March 1890 on the Paddington to Birkenhead route, and further corridor trains were introduced on all the main routes {{over the next few}} years. In 1900 a new Milford Boat Train set introduced electric lights and the communication cord was moved inside the train; until now a passenger needing to stop the train in an emergency had to lean out of the window and pull a cord <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> At this time carriages generally had a clerestory roof but elliptical roofs were fitted to the GWR steam rail motors in 1903.|$|E
50|$|A large plaster royal {{coat of arms}} is {{positioned}} <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of <b>the</b> small entry foyer. The timber half-turn stair has a decorative timber balustrade and a small cleaner's cupboard with sink is underneath.|$|R
