5|$|In {{addition}} to those in Italian Food, there are many Italian recipes and descriptions of the land <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> David's other works. The first recipe in her first book, Mediterranean Food—soupe au Pistou—is of Genoese origin. Also in that book are recipes for bocconcini, osso bucco, and several Italian pasta and chicken dishes. Among the recipes in Summer Cooking is peperonata (pimentos or sweet peppers cooked with tomatoes in olive oil and butter) which was reprinted as the title article in a later selection from David's works. In An Omelette and a Glass of Wine, David printed Italian recipes including soups and omelettes made with hops (zuppa di lupolli and frittata con i loertis). Also in that book are substantial essays on Italian people and places. Is There a Nutmeg in the House? includes a six-page article on vegetable dishes from Mantua, and another of similar length on the variations of pizza in Italy and beyond.|$|E

25|$|In the Magic Land {{stories of}} Alexander Melentyevich Volkov, the {{prehistory}} is quite different. The land was created 6,000–7,000years {{ago by a}} wizard named Hurricap, who was tired of people coming to him with requests, {{so he decided to}} find a place without them annoying him. He found a remote land and separated it {{from the rest of the}} world, along with putting the enchantments of eternal spring and talking animals (Volkov's version doesn't include any forms of immortality). However, he failed to notice that the land already contained people (since he was a giant, already suffering from nearsightedness in his advanced age, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the Magic Land were much shorter than in other places), but, upon discovering the fact, decided that removing the enchantments would be unnecessary. Instead, he ordered the people to keep away from his castle. After that, the notable events included a conquest attempt by a sorceress named Arachna (Gurrikap was still alive, and put her in an enchanted sleep for 5,000years. Her awakening formed the story for the fifth book in Volkov's series), an unsuccessful coup by a prince named Bofaro to overthrow his father about 1,000years ago (He and his accomplices were banished to an underground cave and became the Magic Land's main source of metal and gems, an analogue to the Nomes), and the arrival of the Four Witches (which only occurred about 500years ago in this continuity).|$|E
500|$|Maintaining {{that humans}} had no free will, Priestley argued {{that what he}} called [...] "philosophical necessity" [...] (akin to {{absolute}} determinism) is consonant with Christianity, a position based on {{his understanding of the}} natural world. Like the rest of nature, man's mind is subject to the laws of causation, Priestley contended, but because a benevolent God created these laws, the world <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> it will eventually be perfected. Evil is therefore only an imperfect understanding of the world.|$|E

500|$|The work {{displays}} a thoughtful symmetry. In {{the center of}} the five parts is the court hearing which confronts Jesus, Pilate, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>people.</b> <b>In</b> the middle of the hearing, a chorale (22) interrupts the argument, which is a discussion about freedom and captivity. It is surrounded by two choral movements, which not only both ask for the crucifixion of Jesus, but also use the same musical motifs, the second time intensified. [...] Again, in a repetition of similar musical material, a preceding [...] choir explains the law, while a corresponding movement reminds Pilate of the Emperor whose authority is challenged by someone calling himself a king. Preceding this, Jesus is greeted in mockery as a king, corresponding in motif to the later request that Pilate should change the inscription saying he is [...] "the King of the Jews" [...] to [...] "He said: I am the King of the Jews".|$|E
500|$|Silence is {{considered}} a [...] "passion project" [...] of Scorsese's {{and has been in}} development since 1990, two years after the release of Scorsese's most controversial film, The Last Temptation of Christ, which also carried strongly religious themes. Scorsese first read the novel in 1989 and obtained the movie rights soon afterwards. When asked why he retained interest in the project for over 26 years, Scorsese stated: [...] "As you get older, ideas go and come. Questions, answers, loss of the answer again and more questions, and this is what really interests me. Yes, the cinema <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> my life and my family are most important, but ultimately as you get older, there's got to be more... Silence is just something that I'm drawn to in that way. It's been an obsession, it has to be done... it's a strong, wonderful true story, a thriller in a way, but it deals with those questions." ...|$|E

500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1988 earthquake in the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, Ryzhkov promised to rebuild the city of Spitak within two years. A Politburo commission was established to provide guidance for the local ASSR Government with Ryzhkov elected its chairman. The commission then travelled to the ASSR to assess damage caused by the earthquake. [...] During Gorbachev's subsequent visit to the ASSR, and aware of local feelings following the disaster, Ryzhkov persuaded the less sensitive Gorbachev to forgo use of his limousine in favor of public transport. When Gorbachev left the ASSR, Ryzhkov remained to coordinate the rescue operation and made several television appearances which increased his standing amongst the Soviet leadership <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> general. With his standing thus boosted, on 19 July 1988, at the Central Committee Plenum, Ryzhkov criticised nearly every one of Gorbachev's policies, further complaining that as Party Secretary he should devote more time to the Party. In the end, Ryzhkov failed in his promise to rebuild Spitak, partly due to the Soviet Union's mounting economic problems, and partly because many of the city's Soviet era buildings had not been designed with adequate earthquake protection, making their reconstruction more difficult.|$|E

500|$|Plath's semi-autobiographical novel, {{which her}} mother wished to block, was {{published}} in 1963 and in the US in 1971. Describing the compilation of the book to her mother, she wrote, [...] "What I've done is to throw together events from my own life, fictionalising to add colour– it's a pot boiler really, but I think it will show how isolated a person feels when he is suffering a breakdown.... I've tried to picture my world <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> it as seen through the distorting lens of a bell jar". She described her novel as [...] "an autobiographical apprentice work which I had to write in order to free myself from the past". She dated a Yale senior named Dick Norton during her junior year. Norton, upon whom the character of Buddy in The Bell Jar is based, contracted tuberculosis and was treated at the Ray Brook Sanatorium near Saranac Lake. While visiting Norton, Plath broke her leg skiing, an incident that was fictionalized in the novel. Plath also used the novel to highlight the issue {{of women in the}} workforce during the 1950s. She strongly believed in their abilities to be writers and editors, while society forced them to fulfill secretarial roles.|$|E
