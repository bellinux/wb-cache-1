40|$|There is current {{interest}} {{in the use of}} artificial wetlands and macrophyte-cultured ponds for the treatment of agricultural drainage water, sewage, and industrial effluents. Aquatic plant-based water treatment systems have proved effective and economical in improving the quality of wastewaters containing excess nutrients, organic pollutants, and heavy metals. This investigation was conducted to test the hypothesis that herbicide-tolerant aquatic plants can remediate herbicide-contaminated waters. The addition of Ceratophyllum demersum (coontail, hornwort), Elodea canadensis (<b>American</b> elodea, Canadian <b>pondweed),</b> or Lemna minor(common duckweed) significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 01) reduced the concentration of [14 C]metolachlor (MET) remaining in the treated water. After a 16 -day incubation period, only 1. 44...|$|R

Fish present in Lake Corpus Christi include crappie, white bass, catfish, and largemouth bass, sunfish, bluegill and Alligator gar. Plant life in the lake includes water stargrass, water lettuce, water hyacinth, <b>American</b> <b>pondweed,</b> coontail, rushes, and cattail. The American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) also inhabit the lake.|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{potential}} for monoecious hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata (L. f.) Royle) to invade existing aquatic plant communities, monoecious hydrilla was grown in mixtures with <b>American</b> <b>pondweed</b> (Potamogeton nodosus Poiret). When grown with hydrilla from axillary turions, <b>American</b> <b>pondweed</b> was a stronger competitor.

40|$|Backwater {{habitats}} {{of large}} rivers provide habitat for aquatic biota and influence important predator-prey interactions in fishes and other aquatic organisms. However, these areas often exhibit turbid conditions and lack habitat complexity. Restoration of lentic habitats through direct habitat manipulations has shown success in prior efforts, but these methods {{have not been}} tested in backwater habitats of large rivers. I attempted to create habitat in an Ohio River embayment by establishing founder colonies of aquatic macrophytes coupled with the placement of underwater gravel beds. I also evaluated the effects of total suspended solids (TSS) on overwintering structures of <b>American</b> <b>Pondweed</b> Potamogeton nodosus and Broadleaf Arrowhead Sagittaria latifolia to improve understanding of factors preventing establishment of aquatic macrophytes in turbid waters. Additionally, I evaluated the success of establishing founder colonies of Broadleaf Arrowhead, American Water Willow Justicia americana, and <b>American</b> <b>Pondweed</b> using various exclosure types and sizes in an Ohio River embayment. Finally, I sampled fishes in the embayment {{both before and after}} habitat enhancement efforts to attempt to detect responses by individual species. I found no differences in either morphology or tissue mass for <b>American</b> <b>Pondweed</b> winterbuds or Broadleaf Arrowhead tubers grown under seven levels of TSS ranging from 0 - 90 mg/L, suggesting that these structures can properly develop under turbid, low light conditions in shallow water. I also found high initial and subsequent year survival of American Water Willow and <b>American</b> <b>Pondweed</b> plants planted in protective exclosures. However, I found low overall early and subsequent year survival of Broadleaf Arrowhead planted using the same exclosures. Finally, I found high interannual variability for relative abundance, density, and mean length for dominant fishes in the embayment between 2012 and 2013. I was able to provide preliminary fish community data for the embayment at the Bryant Creek-Ohio River confluence. Overall, I was able to successfully establish founder colonies of American Water Willow and <b>American</b> <b>Pondweed</b> in the embayment and increase the local habitat complexity. Additionally, I was able to build on current understanding of factors leading to successful restoration techniques in freshwater ecosystems. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} macroinvertebrate {{colonization}} and assemblages, including secondary {{productivity of the}} familiar bluet damselfly or Enallagma civile Hagen (Odonata: Coenagrionidae), associated with the aquatic macrophytes Heteranthera dubia (Jacq.) MacMill. (water stargrass) and Potamogeton nodosus Poir. (<b>American</b> <b>pondweed)</b> was conducted at the Dallas Floodway Extension Trinity River Project (DFE) Lower Chain of Wetlands (LCOW), Dallas, TX, from September 2010 through November 2011. Macroinvertebrate abundance, taxa richness, Simpson's index of diversity, and Simpson's evenness from the two macrophytes and from three different wetland cells of varying construction completion dates, water sources, and native aquatic vegetation establishment were analyzed along with basic water quality metrics (temperature °C, pH, dissolved oxygen mg/L, and conductivity µs/cm). E. civile nymphs were separated into five developmental classes for secondary productivity estimations between macrophytes and wetland cell types. Mean annual secondary productivity in the DFE LCOW among two macrophytes of E. civile was 1392. 90 ash-free dry weight mg/m²/yr, standing stock biomass was 136. 77 AFDW mg/m 2 /yr, cohort production / biomass (P/B) ratio was calculated to be 4. 30 / yr and the annual production / biomass (P/B) ratio was 10. 18 /yr...|$|E
