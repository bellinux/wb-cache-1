5|$|Tantalum is {{considered}} a conflict resource. Coltan, the industrial name for a columbite–tantalite mineral from which columbium (i.e. niobium) and tantalum are extracted, {{can also be found}} in Central Africa, which is why tantalum is being linked to warfare in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire). According to an October 23, 2003 United Nations report, the smuggling and exportation of coltan has helped fuel the war in the Congo, <b>a</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>that</b> has resulted in approximately 5.4 million deaths since 1998 – making it the world’s deadliest documented conflict since World War II. Ethical questions have been raised about responsible corporate behavior, human rights, and endangering wildlife, due to the exploitation of resources such as coltan in the armed conflict regions of the Congo Basin. However, although important for the local economy in Congo, the contribution of coltan mining in Congo to the world supply of tantalum is usually small. The United States Geological Survey reports in its yearbook that this region produced a little less than 1% of the world's tantalum output in 2002–2006, peaking at 10% in 2000 and 2008.|$|E
5|$|The Yongzheng Emperor succeeded the Kangxi Emperor after <b>a</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>that</b> pitted {{many of the}} Kangxi Emperor's sons {{against one}} another. Many Manchu nobles who had sided with the Yongzheng Emperor's rivals during the {{succession}} struggle were still members of the Deliberative Council. To avoid alienating these grandees, the Yongzheng Emperor still made new appointments to the Council and consulted it on various military matters, but he also worked to undermine its power. To bypass the Council, he created smaller parallel bodies which he found more reliable and less entrenched. Slowly, he transferred deliberative powers to these more trusted ministers. Around 1730, these informal institutions crystallized into the Grand Council. Unlike the Deliberative Council, whose membership was almost exclusively Manchu, the Grand Council counted many Chinese among its ranks. This more ethnically mixed privy council served as the empire's main policymaking body {{for the rest of}} the Qing dynasty.|$|E

This period included the General Strike of 1926, <b>a</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>that</b> the government managed to weather, despite the havoc it caused throughout the UK. Baldwin created the Organisation for the Maintenance of Supplies, a volunteer body of those opposed to the strike which was intended to complete essential work.|$|E
25|$|The {{historian}} Zeev Sternhell has {{traced the}} ideological roots of fascism {{back to the}} 1880s and in particular to the fin de siècle theme of that time. The theme {{was based on a}} revolt against materialism, rationalism, positivism, bourgeois society and democracy. The fin-de-siècle generation supported emotionalism, irrationalism, subjectivism and vitalism. The fin-de-siècle mindset saw civilization as being in <b>a</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>that</b> required a massive and total solution. The fin-de-siècle intellectual school considered the individual only one part of the larger collectivity, which should not be viewed as an atomized numerical sum of individuals. They condemned the rationalistic individualism of liberal society and the dissolution of social links in bourgeois society.|$|E

This period intensified into <b>a</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>that</b> almost led to the school's being sold to a foreign religious group. Financial trouble and academic decline continued to burden UE throughout the 1980s. For a brief period in 1984, a controlling interest in the university was held by an entity of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's Transcendental Meditation movement. Students boycotted classes and held protests against the takeover, and in short time control was returned to stakeholders.|$|E
25|$|The annual {{output of}} {{operations}} at RMS-Bellevue, RMS-Treasure Island, and ARMS {{would be a}} few thousand, but the BuNav estimated that the wartime requirement {{would be in the}} tens of thousands. Further, the depth of capability of graduates from the existing instruction was also inadequate. Electronics would have {{a major role in the}} next war – which was now inevitable – but equipment, if not maintained, would be worthless. The NRL and the newly formed Radiation Laboratory, as well as a number of industries, were developing electronic systems that were far above the average maintenance capabilities of existing Navy technicians. This was especially true after late 1940, when Great Britain shared its electronic secrets (including the cavity magnetron) during the Tizard Mission. These shortcomings were <b>a</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>that</b> required an immediate solution.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{personal}} reputation and authority, Parākramabāhu {{did not take}} any steps towards ensuring a smooth succession. One reason offered is the strength of Sri Lankan conventional law, which contained fairly fluid conventions for the replacement of rulers. The chronic instability of the years after his reign undid many of his accomplishments and developed into <b>a</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>that</b> the country never recovered from. The popularity of Parākramabāhu is attested {{by the fact that}} no less than seven monarchs adopted his name over the next four centuries, of whom only two or three could lay claim to even a fraction of his successes. His ultimate weakness was the lack of restraint in his spending, taking Sri Lanka to greater heights that it had reached in a long time, but exhausting the island's resources in the process.|$|E

It also lists the 20 worst countries to be a girl, based on a number of factors including the number of years a girl attends school, the proportion of women who have a paid job relative to men and the likelihood of a woman dying during childbirth. On International Women's Day 2017, ONE released a report that stated 130 million girls are currently out of school.

25|$|Despite {{the protests}} of Franco-Manitobans that the Manitoba Act had been violated, Manitoba {{remained}} monolingual in practice {{until the early}} 1980s, when legal challenges created <b>a</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>that</b> threatened to invalidate almost all laws passed in Manitoba since 1890, {{on the grounds that}} these statutes were not published in French as required by the Manitoba Act. The provincial government under Howard Pawley tried and failed to address the crisis, with the opposition refusing to attend legislative sessions. In 1985 the Supreme Court ruled that the Manitoba Act had been violated and that all provincial legislation must be published in both French and English, restoring the legal equality of the languages that had existed when the province was created. While this restoration of legal equality faced overwhelming public opposition at the time, polls taken in 2003 showed a majority of Manitobans supported provincial bilingualism.|$|E
25|$|In 1833, {{shortly after}} his defeat in the {{previous}} year's presidential election, Clay worked with Calhoun to end the dispute. Though Clay desired a high tariff, he found Jackson's war-like rhetoric against South Carolina distressing, and sought to avoid <b>a</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>that</b> could end in civil war. Working with Calhoun, Clay brokered a deal to lower the tariff gradually, with that deal becoming known as the Compromise Tariff of 1833. On March 2, 1833, with little choice in the matter, Jackson signed into law the compromise tariff {{as well as the}} Force Bill. The compromise tariff helped to preserve the supremacy of the federal government over the states, but the crisis was indicative of the developing conflict between the northern and southern United States over economics and slavery. Clay's role in the compromise, as well as his opposition to Jackson, strongly increased his approval among those in the South.|$|E

25|$|The Praja Parishad {{undertook}} a civil disobedience {{campaign for a}} third time in November 1952, which again led to repression by the state government. The Parishad accused Abdullah of communalism (sectarianism), favouring the Muslim interests in the state and sacrificing the interests of the others. The Jana Sangh joined hands with the Hindu Mahasabha and Ram Rajya Parishad to launch a parallel agitation in Delhi. In May 1953, Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, a prominent Indian leader of the time and the founder of Hindu nationalist party Bharatiya Jana Sangh (later evolved as BJP), made a bid to enter Jammu and Kashmir after denying to take a permit, citing his rights as an Indian citizen to visit any part of the country. Abdullah prohibited his entry and promptly arrested him when he attempted. An estimated 10,000 activists were imprisoned in Jammu, Punjab and Delhi, including Members of Parliament. Unfortunately, Mukherjee died in detention on 23 June 1953, leading to an uproar in whole India and precipitating <b>a</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>that</b> went out of control.|$|E
25|$|From 1780 on, however, a new conjuncture of {{internal}} and external conditions and forces conspired to bring {{the economy and the}} political structure of the Republic to <b>a</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>that</b> they could not survive. The Fourth Anglo-Dutch War ended the cloak of neutrality which had protected Dutch shipping for most of the century, in that period obviating the need for naval protection that was now lacking due to many years of neglect of the navy. Trade came temporarily to a standstill, because the British blockade could not be broken, despite the relative success of the Dutch navy in the Battle of Dogger Bank (1781). The trade of the VOC was devastated, even apart from the loss of some of its colonies. It experienced a liquidity crisis which exposed its inherent insolvency. The company was too important to let it fail (also because of the importance of its outstanding debt in the Dutch financial system), so that it was kept afloat {{for more than a decade}} by emergency aid from the States of Holland, before it was finally nationalized in 1796.|$|E
500|$|In {{a letter}} to Vera Zasulich dated 8 March 1881, Marx {{contemplated}} the possibility of Russia's bypassing the capitalist stage of development and building communism {{on the basis of}} the common ownership of land characteristic of the village mir. While admitting that Russia's rural [...] "commune is the fulcrum of social regeneration in Russia", Marx also warned that in order for the mir to operate as a means for moving straight to the socialist stage without a preceding capitalist stage it [...] "would first be necessary to eliminate the deleterious influences which are assailing it (the rural commune) from all sides". Given the elimination of these pernicious influences, Marx allowed that [...] "normal conditions of spontaneous development" [...] of the rural commune could exist. However, in the same letter to Vera Zasulich he points out that [...] "at the core of the capitalist system... lies the complete separation of the producer from the means of production". In one of the drafts of this letter, Marx reveals his growing passion for anthropology, motivated by his belief that future communism would be a return on a higher level to the communism of our prehistoric past. He wrote that [...] "the historical trend of our age is the fatal crisis which capitalist production has undergone in the European and American countries where it has reached its highest peak, <b>a</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>that</b> will end in its destruction, in the return of modern society to a higher form of the most archaic type—collective production and appropriation". He added that [...] "the vitality of primitive communities was incomparably greater than that of Semitic, Greek, Roman, etc. societies, and, a fortiori, that of modern capitalist societies". Before he died, Marx asked Engels to write up these ideas, which were published in 1884 under the title The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State.|$|E
