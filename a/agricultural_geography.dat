40|$|Innovation Platforms {{are fast}} {{becoming}} part of the mantra of agricultural research for development projects and programmes. Their basic tenet is that stakeholders depend on one another to achieve agricultural development outcomes, and hence need a space where they can learn, negotiate, and coordinate to overcome challenges and capture opportunities through a facilitated innovation process. This important publication provides a critical analysis of Innovation Platforms, their defining features, key functions, and what they can and – as importantly – cannot do. It will be invaluable reading both for those who fund development projects and programmes and would like to understand when Innovation Platforms are the approach of choice, and for those practitioners who implement and facilitate Innovation Platforms and would like to understand better their design principles and practical implementation issues. Because Innovation Platforms have been successful in addressing agricultural challenges, there is a risk that they will be promoted as a panacea for all problems in the agricultural sector. As the authors make clear, however, not all constraints will require Innovation Platforms and, if there is a simpler and cheaper alternative, that should be the first choice. It is essential to think more critically about when, how, and in what form Innovation Platforms can contribute meaningfully to Agricultural development impacts. The document was developed through a learning collaboration between CGIAR research centres and other academic and more applied research centres. Eleven of the 15 CGIAR centres participated and contributed their expertise and experiences across multiple <b>agricultural</b> systems, <b>geographies,</b> and types of complex constraint. The booklet provides information grounded in a rich practical experience of key design and implementation principles, and the financial and human resources that need to be made available, and it makes suggestions for more effective monitoring, evaluation, and learning. It also lists reference materials, answers frequently asked questions, and provides a decision support tool for research, development, and funding agencies. All in all, this publication offers a lot for those who aspire to make sensible use of Innovation Platforms in pursuing agricultural development...|$|R

Farming for Carbon Credits: The {{economic}} integration {{of greenhouse gases}} through smallholder agriculture in the Kenya <b>Agricultural</b> Carbon Project. <b>Geography,</b> advanced level, master thesis for master exam in Globalization, environment and social change, 30 ECTS. Supervisor: Anders Wästfelt Language: English This MSc thesis analyzes a greenhouse gas (GHG) emission offsetting project implemented in smallholder agriculture. The project, {{which is the first}} of its kind, is called the Kenya Agricultural Carbon Project (KACP) and is located in western Kenya. The research question posed is: Does the carbon credit aspect of the KACP represent an integration of the economic externality of GHG emissions. The thesis analyses the KACP as a payment scheme for ecosystem services and applies a lens of neoliberal theory. The methods used are semi-structured interviews, participatory observation and transect walks. Data collection was done during field work at project sites in April and May 2014 and data sources include twenty interviews, eighteen analysed farms, participation in a KACP workshop and participation in a project related e-course organized by the World Bank. The results of the study showed that there are significant inconsistencies in the project that invalidates the KACP an {{economic integration}} of GHG emissions, likely resulting in false carbon credits.

50|$|Baker {{acted as}} a {{part-time}} professor at Clark University from 1923 to 1927, and later gave several series of lectures at other universities. With {{the appearance of the}} journal Economic Geography, Baker became associate editor, and later a contributor of a notable series of articles on regional <b>agricultural</b> <b>geography</b> of North America. His interest in farm populations started around 1920, however it was during the 1930s that this field became a major focus of the USDA. Baker was particularly interested in the migration of rural youths into urban areas. Even into his later years, populations problems occupied much of his research and energies. Baker recognized that only a minority of the world's population lived under decent living conditions. He turned his attention to improving standards for American farmers. He hoped to achieve this by raising the level of appreciation for farmers and their contributions within the United States, and studying recent trends to aid in planning and forecasting potential problems. He also tried to encourage Americans to have larger families in order to ensure successful future generations in the country.|$|E
5000|$|His {{intensive}} work on {{the technological}} aspects of cereal transformation led Maurizio to put more and more emphasis in the historical evolution of food products. In his 1916 book [...] "Die Getreide-Nahrung im Wandel der Zeiten", he describes what had been until then a professional domain with {{the point of view}} of cultural history and ethnography. The fruit of many historical researches and field data was his master work , [...] "Die Geschichte unserer Pflanzennahrung von den Urzeiten bis zur Gegenwart", published in 1927. This is the only book translated to French in 1932, with the title Histoire de l'alimentation végétale depuis la préhistoire jusqu'à nos jours. It was never translated to English. This first scientifically based global panorama on world food history gave Maurizio an international reputation as a historian of technology. With his central thesis that each step of agriculture involves a particular form of food system, and with his interdisciplinary point of view, he opened new research lines for ethnography, history and geography of agriculture. One of the best recensions of this book and its signification for <b>agricultural</b> <b>geography</b> was issued by the historian Richard Krzymowski in 1929 in the [...] "Landwirtschaftlichen Jahrbüchern".|$|E

40|$|The {{conception}} {{underlying the}} Common Agricultural Policy {{today is that}} of integrated development of agriculture and rural areas. It emphasises the need to harmonise economic, social and natural aspects of the operation {{and development of the}} countryside, and to reconcile individual interests of its inhabitants with general goals. It rests on the assumption of a holistic operation of rural space, in opposition to a sectoral approach analysing each aspect of rural life and farming in isolation. The new approach to agricultural and rural development has caused the Community policy towards agriculture to be gradually modified. As a result, the sectoral aspect tends to weaken in local and regional development, while the territorial aspect now figures more and more prominently. In Poland, the research based on the conception of integrated agricultural and rural development, identifying various facets of the transformation of rural space and prospects of its development, started to be conducted on a wide scale after Poland's accession to the European Union. The great cognitive and applied value of studies that have appeared in <b>agricultural</b> and rural <b>geography</b> has made it plain {{that it is necessary to}} regularly monitor changes occurring in rural areas and spatial differences in them, especially in the light of the conception of integrated agricultural and rural development.

40|$|Abstract Ecological pest {{management}} seeks to improve pest control through {{the manipulation of}} ecological processes that promote natural enemies and suppress pests. These approaches can involve cultural practices such as reduced tillage, increased use of non-crop plants that provide food and shelter for natural enemies, and intercropping to enhance the abundance and diversity of natural enemies. A major assumption of ecological {{pest management}} is that these activities can be equally effective for all insect herbivores. Here, I propose that these strategies may only be effective for a subset of pests and geographic regions because most insect pests have complex evolutionary histories that make them difficult to manage. I discuss how crop domestication and human-mediated migration are major evolutionary events that shape the geography of interactions between plants, herbivores, and natural enemies. Insect herbivores can evolve to be pests through three major modes: 1) herbivores associated with the crop wild ancestor may shift onto the domesticated crop, 2) herbivores may host-shift from native host plants onto an introduced crop, or 3) human-mediated migration can introduce insect pests into new cropping regions. The resulting geographic structure can influence the success of pest management by altering ecological factors such as: species distributions, patterns of biodiversity, community structure, and natural enemy attack rates. I discuss how the different modes of insect pest evolution structure a set of relevant questions and approaches for ecological pest management. By acknowledging how <b>agricultural</b> history and <b>geography</b> shape the ecology and evolution of insect pests, we may collectively develop a better capacity to identify where and how ecological pest management approaches can be most broadly effective...|$|R
40|$|Rural stress’ and ‘farming stress’ are {{terms that}} have become {{commonly}} appropriated by British healthbased academic disciplines, the medical profession and social support networks, especially since the gricultural ‘crises’ of B. S. E. and Foot and Mouth disease. Looking beyond the media headlines, {{it is apparent that}} the terms in fact are colloquial catch-alls for visible psychological and physiological outcomes shown by individuals. Seldom have the underlying causes and origins of presentable medical outcomes been probed, particularly {{within the context of the}} patriarchal and traditionally patrilineal way of life which family forms of farming business activity in Britain encapsulate. Thus, this paper argues that insufficient attention has been paid to the conceptualization of the terms. They have become both over-used and ill-defined in their application to British family farm individuals and their life situations. A conceptual framework is outlined that attempts to shift the stress research agenda into the unilluminated spaces of the family farming ‘way of life’ and focus instead on ‘distress’. Drawing upon theorization from <b>agricultural</b> and feminist <b>geography</b> together with cultural approaches from rural geography, four distinct clusters of distress originate from the thoughts of individuals and the social practices now required to enact patriarchal family farming gender identities. These are explored using case study evidence from ethnographic repeated life history interviews with members of seven farming families in Powys, Mid Wales, an area dominated by family forms of farming business. Future research agendas need to be based firmly on the distressing reality of patriarchal family farming and also be inclusive of those who, having rejected the associated way of life, now lie beyond the farm gate...|$|R

5000|$|He was {{promoted}} to full professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1983. He assumed the headship of the geography department the same year. He was later appointed in the departments of urban and regional planning and in economics. In 2006, he moved half his line to the Institute of Government and Public Affairs. In 1989, with Philip Israilevich from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Geoffrey Hewings formed the Regional Economics Applications Laboratory (REAL), a graduate students research center in regional science and a cooperative venture between the Fed and the University of Illinois until 2004. REAL is Geoffrey’s dearest achievement. Since its inception, REAL has provided {{at least two years}} (and usually more) support for 38 doctoral students from <b>agricultural</b> economics, economics, <b>geography</b> and urban and regional planning, welcomed 8 [...] "bolsa sandwiche" [...] PhD students from Brazil who spent one year at REAL working on their doctoral dissertations and hosted over 100 international visitors (visiting students, visiting scholars and visiting professors) who stayed three months or more. At any one time, from 15-30 people will be in residence.REAL's mission is to provide timely, high quality analytical economic information for a variety of uses such as public policy decision making by public sector agencies and for strategic marketing in the private sector. REAL's capabilities revolve around comprehensive state and metropolitan models that integrate econometric and input/output analysis to provide for both impact and forecasting analyses. While REAL's primary focus has been on the economies of the Midwest, REAL has collaborated in the development of models for several regions on the east coast. In addition, two models have been constructed for various states in Brazil and a third is under construction. A model for the Jakarta Metropolitan region is also under construction. REAL draws its staff from both cooperating institutions. Advanced graduate students in the fields of economics, geography, urban and regional planning, computer science and mathematics are also employed on projects, many of which become the basis for theses and dissertations. While Geoffrey has a profound respect for the wide range of regional science techniques, his specialty lies in the field of general equilibrium and input/output analysis. These techniques allow him to build regional economic models that serve as valuable tools for public sector agencies and for strategic marketing in the private sector by analyzing economic conditions and providing forecasts at the local level.|$|R
40|$|It is {{accepted}} that British rural geography has actively engaged with the ‘cultural turn’, {{leading to a}} resurgence of research within the sub-discipline. However, a reading of recent reviews suggests that the cultural turn has largely, if not completely, bypassed those geographers interested in the agricultural sector. Farming centred engagements with notions of culture have been relatively limited compared with those concerned with the non-agricultural aspects of rural space. Indeed, <b>agricultural</b> <b>geography</b> represents something of an awkward case {{in the context of}} the disciplinary turn to culture, a situation that demands further exposition.
