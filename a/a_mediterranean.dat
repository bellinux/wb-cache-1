5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, {{the ship}} was {{transferred}} to the Baltic Fleet and helped to suppress the Sveaborg Rebellion in mid-1906. While on <b>a</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> cruise, she helped survivors of the 1908 Messina earthquake.

It is occasionally grown in gardens as its bright flower spikes are prominent, but requires <b>a</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> (dry summer) climate and good drainage as it is sensitive to dieback. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 26 to 47 days to germinate. A dwarf form is in cultivation.|$|E

5|$|Chirocephalus diaphanus is <b>a</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> species, which {{reaches its}} {{north-western}} limit in Great Britain, and {{is missing from}} Fennoscandia. Its distribution in Western Europe extends almost continuously from Great Britain to the Iberian Peninsula, and as far east as the Rhine in Germany. A single occurrence of C. diaphanus is known from the Benelux countries, in pools in South Limburg, Netherlands. Further east, it occurs south of 47°N in the Apennine and Balkan peninsulas, reaching the Black Sea in Romania; an isolated population exists {{at the mouth of}} the Vistula river in Poland. In the Mediterranean Sea, populations exist on Sicily and Crete.|$|E

5|$|In {{completely}} arbitrary fashion Collet {{chose the}} names of six composers, Auric, Durey, Honegger, Poulenc, Tailleferre and myself, {{for no other reason}} than that we knew each other, that we were friends and were represented in the same programmes, but without the slightest concern for our different attitudes and our different natures. Auric and Poulenc followed the ideas of Cocteau, Honegger was a product of German Romanticism and my leanings were towards <b>a</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> lyrical art... Collet's article made such a wide impression that the Groupe des Six had come into being.|$|E
5|$|It is {{different}} for places with <b>a</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> climate. In the western United States, {{during the cold}} season from September–May, extratropical cyclones from the Pacific Ocean move inland into the region due to a southward migration of the jet stream during the cold season. This shift in the jet stream brings much of the annual precipitation to the region, and sometimes also brings heavy rain and strong low pressure systems. The peninsula of Italy has weather {{very similar to the}} western United States in this regard.|$|E

5|$|It {{is fairly}} easy to grow in areas with <b>a</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> climate, but does not do well in areas with high summer humidity. It {{requires}} a sunny position in well-drained soil, and tolerates at least moderate frost.

Seeds do not require any treatment prior to sowing, and take 21 to 35 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|Levant {{returned}} to Portsmouth in early 1775, but put to sea again on 22 June amid {{the early stages}} of the American Revolutionary War. Captain Murray's orders were to join <b>a</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> squadron under the overall command of Captain Robert Mann, which was tasked with intercepting merchant vessels suspected of supplying American rebels. While at sea Murray also took the opportunity to train his crew in seamanship and battle techniques, in preparation for future enemy engagement. In March 1776 she anchored in the Bay of Algiers where the Dey, or local ruler, received her warmly and provided the crew with supplies of bread, vegetables, and three live sheep.|$|E

5|$|Sorabji, {{who claimed}} to be of Spanish–Italian–Sicilian ancestry, {{composed}} various pieces that reflect an enthusiasm for those cultures, such as Fantasia ispanica, Rosario d'arabeschi and Passeggiata veneziana sopra la Barcarola di Offenbach.

They are considered among his outwardly more virtuosic and musically less ambitious works.|$|E
