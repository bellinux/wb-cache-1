He was used mostly as a middle relief pitcher. <b>A</b> <b>streak</b> <b>of</b> poor pitching was interrupted by the 1981 Major League Baseball strike, and he finished with an ERA of 3.51.|$|E
50|$|These {{two teams}} marked the {{beginning}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> post season <b>streak</b> <b>of</b> eight straight seasons, longest in Georgia basketball history.

5|$|The mid-season, non-conference {{game was}} the first meeting between the two teams; both came into the game with highly rated offenses and poorly rated defenses. Before the game the Midshipmen had a 5–4 record, most {{recently}} defeating the Notre Dame Fighting Irish to break <b>a</b> <b>streak</b> <b>of</b> 43 consecutive losses to that team. Another win would qualify them for a bowl game. The Mean Green held a 1–7 record, and could not become bowl eligible by winning its remaining games, but the team's offense had improved {{over the course of}} the season.|$|E
5|$|The {{next year}} in 1962, the Red Sox {{had been in the}} middle of <b>a</b> <b>streak</b> <b>of</b> 8 losing seasons. The team was so bad, that after a 13-3 loss to the Yankees on July 26, Red Sox ace Gene Conley got off the bus and {{attempted}} to leave the country and go to Israel. Conley was denied his request because {{he did not have a}} passport. Nonetheless, Conley did stay away from the team for 3 days.|$|E

The Rockies were in position {{to qualify for the}} playoffs 60 games into the 1976–77 season, but <b>a</b> <b>streak</b> <b>of</b> 18 games without a win caused them to fall from contention. The Rockies ended the campaign last in the division with a 20–46–14 record and 54 points, and improved to 59 points the next season. Despite having the sixth-worst record in the League, the Rockies beat-out the Vancouver Canucks for second in the Division by two points and gained a playoff berth. The Philadelphia Flyers eliminated the Rockies from the playoffs in the preliminary rounds.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the final}} Test, Hassett's run-scoring peaked when he stroked 232 against Brown's {{men in a}} drawn match for Victoria. In the Fifth Test at the MCG, he top-scored with 92 before his {{dismissal}} to a one-handed diving catch sparked a collapse and Australia managed only 217 batting first. The tourists took a first innings lead and Hassett made 48 in Australia’s second innings of 197. England made the 95 needed for victory, and the eight-wicket loss was Australia's first Test defeat since the resumption of international cricket after World War II, ending <b>a</b> <b>streak</b> <b>of</b> 25 Tests without defeat. Hassett and Brown described the series as the friendliest they had been involved in, but despite the success on the field, the series was poorly attended and revenue was down by around 25% from the corresponding tour four years earlier, mainly due {{to the absence of}} Bradman to spark public interest.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1988, the West Indies had {{experienced}} nearly ten years as the best Test team in world cricket, including <b>a</b> <b>streak</b> <b>of</b> winning 10 of 11 Test series they played from 1980 to 1985–86 (the other was drawn). However, the West Indies side that had enjoyed this considerable recent success was beginning {{to show signs of}} ageing. The experienced batsmen Viv Richards (the captain), Gordon Greenidge, Jeff Dujon, and Desmond Haynes were all coming to the end of their careers, and bowlers Michael Holding and Joel Garner and batsman Larry Gomes had recently retired. As a result, the squad arrived with an unusually inexperienced group of pace bowlers. Supporting Malcolm Marshall, a veteran of 53 Tests, were relative newcomers Courtney Walsh (20 Tests), Patrick Patterson (11), Winston Benjamin (4), Curtly Ambrose (3) and Ian Bishop (0).|$|E
