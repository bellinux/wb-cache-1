40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{deals with}} the various aspects of {{commonly}} used <b>flavouring</b> <b>agents</b> for the preparation of medicaments. Flavour refers to a mixed sensation of taste, touch, smell, sight and sound, all of which involve a combination of physio-chemical and physiological actions that influence the perception of substances. With the expansion of technology in the <b>flavour</b> industry, many <b>artificial</b> or imitation <b>flavours</b> have been created. Cough syrups, laxatives, sedatives antihistamines, antibiotics, vitamins and pediatric and geriatric formulations now are available {{in a variety of}} flavours which successfully mask unpleasant tastes without affecting physica...|$|R

40|$|<b>Flavouring</b> <b>agents</b> {{have been}} used {{worldwide}} in food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical products. Most of the <b>flavouring</b> <b>agents</b> used are synthetically produced which at times lack the natural taste of the material. This study aimed to study the usage of tropical fruits as natural <b>flavouring</b> <b>agents</b> and the best mechanism and solvent system {{that are able to}} extract the best quality of <b>flavouring</b> <b>agent.</b> The tropical fruit chosen in this study is A. heterophyllus L. or commonly known as jackfruit. Three solvent systems (50 %, 70 % and 90 % ethanol) and two processing mechanisms (blended and whole fruit flesh) are studied in this research. The utilization of jackfruit waste (perigones) is also studied. The total phenolic content (TPC) of each extract was measured and the samples with the highest and lowest TPC content was evaluated using trained panelists. The results of the study showed that the sample extracted using solvent system with the highest polarity and blended mechanism (50 % EtOH Blended) contains the highest concentration of phenols while the lowest TPC was measured in 90 % EtOH whole jackfruit flesh. The perigones of the jackfruit also showed a significant amount of phenols which can be further utilized. The results of the sensory evaluation showed {{no significant difference between the}} sample with the highest and lowest TPC. This shows that for the production of <b>flavouring</b> <b>agent</b> from A. heterophyllus L. blending is not required to produce a <b>flavouring</b> <b>agent</b> that is acceptable by consumers which will reduce the cost of production...|$|R
