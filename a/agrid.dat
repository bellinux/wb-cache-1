40|$|International audienceFace to the {{limitations}} of the classical computationmodel, neuromorphic systems are envisaged as an alternative. Interesting properties of the neural systems are its highly parallelcomputation, and its self-organizing capabilities. In this paper,we study how to bring distribution in the hardware computationof these neural models, {{especially in the case of}} self-organizingmaps. We propose a bio-inspired hardware substrate in which <b>agrid</b> of neural processing elements will support a set of neurocognitiveprocesses. We describe an original distributed artificialneural network adapted to hardware scalability and provide theresults of its implementation as a set of NPUs onto FPGA devices...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTraditional largesparselinearsolvers are not suited in <b>agrid</b> {{computing}} environment as they require alarge amount of synchronization and communication penalizing the performance on this architecture. This paper presents some {{features of the}} solver designed during the current GREMLINS (GRid Efficient Method forLINear Systems) project. The GREMLINS solver limits the amount of communication as {{it is based on}} a coarse grained iterative method called multisplitting method. Moreover, the solver can be executed either in a synchronous or an asynchronous mode. In the latter case, iterations are desynchronized and there is no more synchronization at all. It may result in a faster execution time compared to the synchronous case. Some experiments presented in this paper with the GRID' 5000 architecture, a nation wide experimental grid in France, allowed us to highlight interesting features of this solver...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we fused high-spatial {{resolution}} (3. 7 m) hyperspectral imagery with 22 pulse/m 2 lidar data at the individual crown object scale to map 29 common tree species in Santa Barbara, California, USA. We first adapted andparallelized awatershed segmentation algorithm to delineate individual crowns from <b>agridded</b> canopymax-ima model. From each segment, we extracted all spectra exceeding a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) threshold and a suite of crown structural metrics computed directly from the three-dimensional lidar point cloud. The variables were fused and crowns were classified using canonical discriminant analysis. The full complement of spectral bands along with 7 lidar-derived structural metrics were reduced to 28 canonical variates and classified. Species-level and leaf-type level maps were produced with respective overall accuracies of 83. 4 % (kappa = 82. 6) and 93. 5 %. The addition of lidar data resulted {{in an increase in}} classification accuracy of 4. 2 percentage points over spectral data alone. The value of the lidar structural metrics for urban species dis-crimination became particularly evident when mapping crowns that were either small or morphologically unique. For instance, the accuracy with which we mapped the tall palm speciesWashingtonia robusta increased from 29 % using spectral bands to 71 %with the fused dataset. Additionally, we evaluated the role that automated segmentation plays in classification error and the prospects for mapping urban forest species not included in a training sample. The ability to accurately map urban forest species is an important step towards spatially explicit urban forest ecosystem assessment...|$|R
40|$|International audienceUsing grid {{resources}} to execute scientific applications requiring {{a large amount}} of computing power is attractivebut not easy from the user point of view. Vigne is a grid operating system designed to provide users with a simplified view of <b>agrid.</b> Vigne deals with the huge number of nodes in a large-scale grid and with the nodes’ dynamic behavior by using peer-to-peeroverlays as a keystone. In this paper, we show why it is highly desirable to use structured and unstructured peer-to-peer overlaysfor building the high-level services of Vigne grid operating system. To show the interest of our approach, we detail the features oftwo Vigne services built on top of peer-to-peer overlays. We also present experimental results obtained on the Grid’ 5000 testbedshowing the scalability of the Vigne infrastructure based on overlays and its practical interest for the implementation of Vignedistributed services...|$|E
40|$|APPLICABILITY: This Temporary Instruction (TI) {{applies to}} all holders of {{operating}} licenses for nuclear power reactors, except nuclear power reactors that have permanently ceased operations and have certified that fuel has been permanently removed from the reactor vessel. 2515 / 165 - 01 OBJECTIVE The objective of this TI is to gather information to support the assessment of nuclear power plant (NPP) operational readiness of offsite power (OSP) systems and impact on plant risk in accordance with NRC requirements prescribed in Plant Technical Specifications and 10 CFR 50. 65 (a) (4), ARequirements for monitoring the effectiveness of maintenance at nuclear power plants. @ 2515 / 165 - 02 BACKGROUND The loss of all alternating current (AC) power at NPPs involves the loss of offsite power (LOOP) combined {{with the loss of}} the onsite emergency power supplies (typically emergency diesel generators (EDGs)). This is also referred to as a station blackout (SBO). Risk analyses performed for NPPs indicate that the loss of all AC power can be a significant contributor to the core damage frequency. Although NPPs are designed to cope with a LOOP event through the use of onsite power supplies, LOOP events are considered to be precursors to a SBO. An increase in the frequency or duration of LOOP events increases the risk of core damage. The NRC has been evaluating the reliability of offsite power for NPPs {{over the last several years}} as a result of the changes in the operation of the surrounding electrical power grids due to deregulation and other legislative and economic forces. The NRC issued a regulatory issue summary ((RIS) 2004 - 5, <b>AGrid</b> Operability and the Impact on Plant Risk and the Operability of Offsite Power, @ dated April 15, 2004) to advise NPP addressees o...|$|E
40|$|Launch Weather Officers (LWOs) {{from the}} 45 th Weather Squadron (45 WS) and forecasters from the National Weather Service (NWS) Spaceflight Meteorology Group (SMG) have {{identified}} anvil forecasting {{as one of}} their most challenging tasks when predicting the probability of violating the Lightning Launch Commit Criteria (LLCC) (Krider et al. 2006; Space Shuttle Flight Rules (FR), NASA/JSC 2004)). As a result, the Applied Meteorology Unit (AMU) developed a tool that creates an anvil threat corridor graphic that can be overlaid on satellite imagery using the Meteorological Interactive Data Display System (MIDDS, Short and Wheeler, 2002). The tool helps forecasters estimate the locations of thunderstorm anvils at one, two, and three hours into the future. It has been used extensively in launch and landing operations by both the 45 WS and SMG. The Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) is now used along with MIDDS for weather analysis and display at SMG. In Phase I of this task, SMG tasked the AMU to transition the tool from MIDDS to AWIPS (Barrett et aI., 2007). For Phase II, SMG requested the AMU make the Anvil Forecast Tool in AWIPS more configurable by creating the capability to read model gridded data from user-defined model files instead of hard-coded files. An NWS local AWIPS application called <b>AGRID</b> was used to accomplish this. In addition, SMG needed to be able to define the pressure levels for the model data, instead of hard-coding the bottom level as 300 mb and the top level as 150 mb. This paper describes the initial development of the Anvil Forecast Tool for MIDDS, followed by the migration of the tool to AWIPS in Phase I. It then gives a detailed presentation of the Phase II improvements to the AWIPS tool...|$|E
40|$|Beamline P 11 at PETRA III is {{dedicated}} to imaging anddiffraction experiments of biological samples. Thebeamline provides two experimental endstations: anX-ray microscope and a crystallography experiment. The P 11 X-ray optics consist of a LN 2 cooled doublecrystal monochromator and two horizontal deflectingand one vertical deflecting X-ray mirrors. The mirrorsare dynamically bendable and are used to generate anintermediate focus at 65. 5 m from the source with a sizeof 16 × 96 μm 2 rms (v × h). The crystallography endstation is installed {{on top of a}} 8 meter long granite block which is the key element of theP 11 experimental hutch. The sample position is locatedat 72. 9 m from the source. A CVD diamond basedX-ray feedback system provides a long term beamposition stability of better than 1 μm. Thecrystallography experiment is equipped with a highprecision single axis goniometer with a combinedsphere of confusion of smaller than 100 nm. Theinstrument provides an on-axis microscope for easycrystal centering and beam alignment. Diffractionexperiments can be performed at energies between 4 and 30 keV. The beamsize can be adjusted between 6 × 12 μm 2 FWHM (v × h) with a photon flux of about 2 × 1012 ph/s and 300 × 300 μm 2 FWHM (v × h) with 1 × 1013 ph/s. Due to the very small beam divergenceP 11 is ideally suited to measure large unit cell systems,such as viruses or large molecular complexes.
