5|$|Unlike ski jumping, {{which can}} be contested in the summer on {{specially}} equipped hills, ski flying is strictly a winter sport and {{not part of the}} Winter Olympics; no world records have therefore been set at the games. Also in contrast to ski jumping, athletes are not able to practice on ski flying hills out-of-season, as they are used only for competition events. Among the Alpine countries there is <b>an</b> <b>unwritten</b> gentlemen's agreement forbidding athletes under the age of 18 to participate in ski flying events, although an exception was made for 17-year-old Domen Prevc in 2017.|$|E
5|$|On 25 July 1993, {{following}} Hezbollah's {{killing of}} seven Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon, Israel launched Operation Accountability (known in Lebanon as the Seven Day War), {{during which the}} IDF carried out their heaviest artillery and air attacks on targets in southern Lebanon since 1982. The aim of the operation was to eradicate {{the threat posed by}} Hezbollah and to force the civilian population north to Beirut so as to put pressure on the Lebanese Government to restrain Hezbollah. The fighting ended when <b>an</b> <b>unwritten</b> understanding was agreed to by the warring parties. Apparently, the 1993 understanding provided that Hezbollah combatants would not fire rockets at northern Israel, while Israel would not attack civilians or civilian targets in Lebanon.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} decade of the new century, Du Bois emerged as a {{spokesperson}} for his race, second only to Booker T. Washington. Washington was the director of the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, and wielded tremendous influence within the African-American and white communities. Washington was the architect of the Atlanta Compromise, <b>an</b> <b>unwritten</b> deal he struck in 1895 with Southern white leaders who dominated state governments after Reconstruction. Essentially the agreement provided that Southern blacks, who overwhelmingly lived in rural communities, would submit to the current discrimination, segregation, disenfranchisement, and non-unionized employment; that Southern whites would permit blacks to receive a basic education, some economic opportunities, and justice within the legal system; and that Northern whites would invest in Southern enterprises and fund black educational charities.Lewis, pp. 180–181.Logan, Rayford Whittingham (1997), The Betrayal of the Negro, from Rutherford B.

5|$|Similarly, modern {{equipment}} {{was developed to}} reduce injuries. The football helmet, although a scapegoat for concussions, serves as effective protection against more dangerous injuries like skull fractures. The modern helmet traces its roots back to the leather helmets used by football players in the early 1900s {{to protect themselves from}} head injuries. Helmets later evolved to be made of hard plastic, and a facemask was added to protect players from sustaining facial injuries. Many players also wear mouthguards to prevent injuries to their teeth and tongues; at some levels, such as the NCAA, the use of a mouthguard is mandatory. Football players wear a number of pads to protect themselves – shoulder pads are the most important pads, protecting the shoulder and sternum, but thigh pads, hip pads, tail pads, and knee pads are also used. Many quarterbacks wear flak jackets to protect their ribcage. Cleats come in a number of lengths, with players choosing which cleat to use based on the playing field – on artificial turf, for example, players prefer a shorter cleat to prevent their feet from digging into the ground and risking injury, while longer cleats are generally used on fields that are wet or slippery to provide better traction. Athletic cups are not typically used at the professional level, because athletic cups tend to make it harder to move and there is <b>an</b> <b>unwritten</b> code among players not to target the groin area. Additionally, studies have shown that proper conditioning techniques, fitness routines and exercise routines, as well as high-quality equipment and coaching, can reduce the risk of injury among players.|$|E
25|$|Custom in Catholic {{canon law}} is the {{repeated}} and constant performance of certain acts for a defined period of time, which, {{with the approval of}} the competent legislator, thereby acquire the force of law.

On December 7, 2004, the Ontario Liberal Party announced that it would run a candidate against Tory in a by-election. This caused some controversy as the Liberal and Conservative parties in Canada have historically allowed major party leaders who do not have a parliamentary seat to enter the legislature unopposed, though this has been broken in recent years and the NDP have never followed such <b>an</b> <b>unwritten</b> rule.|$|E

25|$|Because Navajo has {{a complex}} grammar, {{it is not}} nearly {{mutually}} intelligible enough with even its closest relatives within the Na-Dene family to provide meaningful information.

Navajo was spoken only on the Navajo lands of the American Southwest. Its syntax and tonal qualities, not to mention dialects, made it unintelligible to anyone without extensive exposure and training. One estimate indicates that at the outbreak of World War II, fewer than 30 non-Navajo could understand the language.|$|E
25|$|From 10 August 2001, EastEnders {{then added}} its fourth episode (shown on Fridays). This caused some {{controversy}} as it clashed with Coronation Street, {{which at the}} time was moved to 8pm to make way for an hour-long episode of rural soap Emmerdale at 7pm. The move immediately provoked an angry response from ITV insiders, who argued that the BBC's last-minute move—only revealed at 3.30pm on the day—broke <b>an</b> <b>unwritten</b> scheduling rule that the two flagship soaps would not be put directly against each other. In this first head-to-head battle, EastEnders claimed victory over its rival.|$|E
25|$|The Twenty-second Amendment (1951) limits {{an elected}} {{president}} to two terms in office, {{a total of}} eight years. However, under some circumstances {{it is possible for}} an individual to serve more than eight years. Although nothing in the original frame of government limited how many presidential terms one could serve, the nation's first president, George Washington, declined to run for a third term, suggesting that two terms of four years were enough for any president. This precedent remained <b>an</b> <b>unwritten</b> rule of the presidency until broken by Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was elected to a third term as president 1940 and in 1944 to a fourth.|$|E

50|$|Christie {{nominated}} Timpone, a Democrat, for the NJ Supreme Court in April 2016, withdrawing his February 2016 {{nomination of}} David F. Bauman, a Republican. The selection {{to fill a}} long-vacant seat on court has been matter of controversy about the political composition of the court since the governor's first term. Timpone's identification as a Democrat made the nomination more palatable to the New Jersey Senate, which conducts confirmation hearings. Christie {{said he would have}} preferred a Republican, but relieved that the controversy would be settled. <b>As</b> <b>unwritten</b> rule and senatorial courtesy, Timpone met with each of Union County's state senators Nicholas Scutari (D), Ray Lesniak (D), Tom Kean, Jr. (R).

50|$|The {{constitution}} of the Roman Republic was <b>a</b> mostly <b>unwritten</b> constitution which developed organically from the Republic's founding in 509 BC.

25|$|The Constitution of the Roman Empire was <b>an</b> <b>unwritten</b> set of {{guidelines}} and principles passed down mainly through precedent. After {{the fall of the}} Roman Republic, the constitutional balance of power shifted from the Roman Senate to the Roman Emperor. Beginning with the first emperor, Augustus, the emperor and the senate were theoretically two co-equal branches of government. In practice, however, the actual authority of the imperial Senate was negligible, as the emperor held the true power of the state. During the reign of the second emperor, Tiberius, many of the powers that had been held by the Roman assemblies were transferred to the Senate.|$|E
25|$|A similar fate – {{disqualification}} by {{the military}} – would befall Shehu Musa Yar'Adua, Atiku's friend and political mentor, in his 1992 bid for the presidential primary of the SDP. With no chance of contesting for the presidency, Yar'Adua decided to push Atiku forward as {{the focal point of}} SDP's ambitions. Atiku came third in the convention primary. But because MKO Abiola, the winner, had won by only about 400 votes a run-off was due. Atiku stepped down for Abiola, asking his supporters to cast their votes for him, with <b>an</b> <b>unwritten</b> agreement that Abiola would announce Atiku as his running mate. Abiola won the SDP ticket, and announced Babagana Kingibe, the runner-up, as his running mate.|$|E
25|$|The union hired Clarence Darrow {{to defend}} the McNamaras.

Now more desperate than ever, he persuaded the McNamaras to plead guilty on the basis of <b>an</b> <b>unwritten</b> plea bargain that would have freed John. Once they pleaded guilty, however, the authorities denied that they had any deal at all. John McNamara served nearly ten years, while his brother spent his remaining years in prison.|$|E
