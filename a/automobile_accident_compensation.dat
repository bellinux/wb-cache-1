In 1961, Parga became the first Puerto Rican to be named as part of the United States Republican Youth National Committee. During this time, he also served Press Aide to Senator Miguel A. García Méndez. In 1968, Parga ran unsuccessfully for an at-large seat in the Puerto Rico House of Representatives under the Republican Party, which would disappear following that year's elections. He then worked as Director of Public Relations at the <b>Automobile</b> <b>Accidents</b> <b>Compensation</b> Administration (ACAA) from 1969 to 1973.|$|R
5000|$|Over {{the years}} {{a number of}} issues have been studied in depth by club leaders, member committees, or {{scholars}} commissioned by the Commonwealth Club. Among the topics studied have been direct democracy (the initiative process), air pollution, a statewide water plan, restrictions on child labor, <b>automobile</b> and industrial <b>accident</b> <b>compensation,</b> and legislative procedures. The long-standing mandate of many such studies has been [...] "to investigate and discuss problems affecting the welfare of the Commonwealth and to aid in their solution." [...] Many policy innovations in California - such as public defenders' offices and a printed voter explanation booklet to go with ballots - originated in studies and discussions at the Commonwealth Club.|$|R

5000|$|The Puerto Rico <b>Automobile</b> <b>Accident</b> <b>Compensation</b> Administration [...] - Administración de Compensaciones por Accidentes de Automóviles (ACAA) - [...] is a government-owned {{corporation}} of Puerto Rico that provides {{compensation for the}} medical and disability expenses resulting from traffic accidents in Puerto Rico. The coverage offered by the corporation is mandatory, but private insurance companies are allowed to provide supplemental policies.

40|$|The <b>automobile</b> <b>accident</b> <b>compensation</b> {{scheme in}} the United States {{has long been}} the subject of {{academic}} and public policy debate. <b>Automobile</b> <b>accident</b> <b>compensation</b> was historically determined under a tort system in all states.

40|$|The {{expense of}} accidents, {{financial}} responsibility laws, and {{the widespread use}} of motor vehicles make automobile insurance a significant public policy issue. <b>Automobile</b> <b>accident</b> <b>compensation</b> schemes range from full tort to no-fault in the United States. There is a substantial body of research that examines {{the costs and benefits of}} each system, but no consensus on which is most efficient and equitable. Many studies of auto insurance regulation have focused on the difference in accident rates and loss costs between states that have a no-fault compensation system and those that rely on the tort system (see, for example, Cummins, Phillips, and Weiss...|$|E

Its principal governing act today is the <b>Accident</b> <b>Compensation</b> Act 2001. As a Crown entity, ACC is responsible to a Cabinet Minister via its Board of Directors.

40|$|The reticence of Canadian {{courts to}} substantively develop tort law beyond the ambit of English precedent, {{coupled with a}} {{conservative}} legislative approach, has often left Canadian tort law looking more English than the English. What is needed, then, is for more Canadian judges to adopt the audacious approach demonstrated by Justice Roach in Atkinson v. Fleming. On the other hand, tort law may soon be rendered superfluous by burgeoning social welfare legislation, changing insurance practices and other institutional alterations. Allen M. Linden explores unusual danger, product liability and <b>automobile</b> <b>accident</b> <b>compensation,</b> three important areas of personal injury law, in light of competing winds of change that will either galvanise or desiccate Canadian tort law...|$|E
40|$|In 1977, Bernzweig (1) eloquently {{outlined}} the severedysfunction in the United States ’ fault and no-fault in-jury compensation systems. Although recent legislation seeks to promote patient safety through confidential error reporting (2), the dysfunction persists, and initiatives to compensate injured patients are lacking (3). Advocates of “reform ” focus on laws to limit medical liability insurance premiums {{and costs of}} the practice of defensive medicine. Common statutory changes, which neglect the predica-ment of injured patients, are caps on payments for pain and suffering. These caps range about 6 -fold across the 50 states, and California’s cap, fixed at $ 250 000 in 1975, has never been adjusted for inflation. One must question the equity of such wide-ranging limits (4). Meaningful reform must recognize 4 underlying issues. First, many patients (and at times their family members) are injured (5); how-ever, as few as 1 in 50 patients injured by medical negli-gence ever files a claim (6) and fewer receive compensation. Second, expert disagreement about the cause of adverse medical events is pervasive (7), a reality that will challenge any form of adjudication model, judicial or administrative. Third, litigation, liability insurance, and reporting systems (such as the National Practitioner Data Bank) create disin-centives for providers of care to admit error. Fourth, liti-gation (8), and even no-fault injury compensation pro-grams (9), can be expensive, unpleasant, and fraught with ill will and delays. In this issue, Kachalia and colleagues (10) add to our understanding of new models for compensating patients injured by medical error. The University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) identifies errors, discloses them to the injured patients, and offers financial compensation, all without the involvement of the legislature, Congress, courts, or administrative agencies and with greatly reduced expenses for attorneys. Models for routine, voluntary dis-closure of medical adverse events are not new. Three de-cades ago, Jeffrey O’Connell, the well-known author of <b>automobile</b> <b>accident</b> <b>compensation</b> reform (11), proposed a plan to prompt physicians and hospitals to identify errors and approach the injured patient with an unsolicited early offer of compensation (12).
