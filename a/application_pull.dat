The second reason is strong <b>application</b> <b>pull</b> for computer support for negotiation at the operative decision making level. For example, we are witnessing the advent of small transaction electronic commerce on the Internet for purchasing goods, information, and communication bandwidth [29].

This paper studies the key design issues that must be resolved to allow active networking to become a mainstream technology. 1 Introduction The growing sophistication of networked applications {{and the need for}} more complex network services to support them are creating a growing demand for programmable network components. At the same time, continuing advances in integrated circuit technology are making it possible to implement several complete processor subsystems on a single chip. Active networking is one response to this convergence of <b>application</b> <b>pull</b> and technology push [8]. By increasing the programmability of network components, it promises to dramatically simplify the deployment of new protocols and new network services.

40|$|Abstract—Diffusion Tensor MRI (DTI) is {{a rather}} recent image {{acquisition}} modality that can help identify disease processes in nerve bundles in the brain. Due to the large and complex nature of such data, its analysis requires new and sophisticated pipelines that are more efficiently executed within a grid environment. We present our progress {{over the past four}} years in the development and porting of the DTI analysis pipeline to grids. Starting with simple jobs submitted from the command-line, we moved towards a workflow-based implementation and finally into a web service that can be accessed via web browsers by end-users. The analysis algorithms evolved from basic to state-of-the-art, currently enabling the automatic calculation of a populationspecific “atlas ” where even complex brain regions are described in an anatomically correct way.

30|$|Efficient {{resource}} sharing. An important <b>application</b> <b>pull</b> and use-case of VWNs {{in general}} is the convenience of supporting multiple virtual owners (also known as tenants) on shared infrastructure. The trend of VWNs provides better support for multi-tenancy and multi-provider and infrastructure sharing, which is convenient {{both in terms of}} user experience and economics[202]. Each tenant is provided with a ‘slice’ - which is an virtualized abstraction of shared wireless infrastructural components - with a committed service-level agreement (SLA) to allow efficient resource sharing of expensive infrastructure. For instance, in the service provider domain, there is a need of supporting multiple virtual network operators (VNOs) - mobile VNOs (MVNOs) in the context of mobile carrier networks[203] - on shared infrastructure to lower the capital and operational expenditures (CAPEX and OPEX). The trend of VWNs can also be used with other trends such as SWNs to facilitate multi-tenancy as has been proposed in the MobileFlow framework[135] to build multi-tenant mobile networks.|$|E

40|$|The Grid is an {{emerging}} platform to support on-demand “virtual organisations ” for coordinated resource sharing {{and problem solving}} on a global scale. The application thrust is large-scale scientific endeavour, and the scale and complexity of scientific data presents challenges for databases. The Grid is beginning to exploit technologies developed for Web Services and to realise its potential it also stands to benefit from Semantic Web technologies; conversely, the Grid and its scientific users provide <b>application</b> <b>pull</b> which will benefit the Semantic Web. What is the Grid? The Grid is “flexible, secure, coordinated resource sharing among dynamic collections of individuals, institutions, and resources—what we refer to as virtual organizations. ” Foster et al, 2001 [1]. Large-scale science and engineering are undertaken through the interaction of people, heterogeneous computing resources, information systems, and instruments, {{all of which are}} geographically and organizationally dispersed. “The Grid ” is {{an emerging}} platform to support coordinated resource sharing and problem solving on a global scale for data-intensive and compute-intensive applications [1]. The name arose from an analogy with an electricity power grid: computing and data resources would be delivered over the Internet seamlessly, transparently and dynamically as and when needed, just like electricity. Thus, the overall motivation for Grids is to facilitate the routine interactions of resources in order to support largescale science and engineering. The Grid was originally focused on sharing computational power and resources for advanced science and engineering. The ‘metacomputing’ projects of the early 1990 s set out to build virtual supercomputers using networked computer systems. The target applications were, and primarily continue to be, large-scale science. Fo...|$|E

40|$|Background - Not much {{is known}} about the exact role offorce {{feedback}} in laparoscopy. This study aimed to determine whether force feedback influences movements of instruments during training in laparoscopic tasks and whether force feedback is required for training in basic laparoscopic force application tasks. Methods - A group of 19 gynecologic residents, randomly divided into two groups, performed three laparoscopic tasks in both the box trainer and the virtual reality (VR) trainer. The box-VR group began with the box trainer, whereas the VR-box group began with the VR trainer. The three selected tasks included different levels of force application. The box trainer provides natural force feedback, whereas the VR trainer does not provide force feedback. The performance of the two groups was compared with regard to time, path length, and depth perception. Results - For the tasks in which force plays hardly a role, no differences between box-VR group and the VR-box group were found. During a task in which force <b>application</b> (<b>pulling</b> and pushing forces) plays a role, the box-VR group outperformed VR-box group in the box trainer. Moreover, training with the box trainer had a positive effect on subsequent performance of the task with the VR trainer. This was not found the other way around. No differences were found between box-VR and the VR-box group in tasks not requiring force application. Conclusion - Force feedback influences basic laparoscopic skills during tasks in which pulling and pushing forces are applied. For these tasks, the switch from the trainer without force feedback to the one with natural force feedback has a detrimental effect on performance. Therefore, training for tasks in which forces play an important role (e. g., stretching, grasping) should be done using systems with natural force feedback, whereas eye–hand coordination can be trained without force feedback.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Lean Manufacturing (LM) is widely accepted as a world-class manufacturing paradigm, its currency and superiority are manifested in numerous recent success stories. Most lean tools including Just-in-Time (JIT) were designed for repetitive serial production systems. This resulted in a substantial stream of research which dismissed a priori the suitability of LM for non-repetitive non-serial job-shops. The extension of LM into non-repetitive production systems is opposed {{on the basis of}} the sheer complexity of applying JIT pull production control in non-repetitive systems fabricating a high variety of products. However, the application of LM in job-shops is not unexplored. Studies proposing the extension of leanness into non-repetitive production systems have promoted the modification of pull control mechanisms or reconfiguration of job-shops into cellular manufacturing systems. This thesis sought to address the shortcomings of the aforementioned approaches. The contribution of this thesis to knowledge in the field of production and operations management is threefold: Firstly, a Multi-Agent System (MAS) is designed to directly apply pull production control to a good approximation of a real-life job-shop. The scale and complexity of the developed MAS prove that the <b>application</b> of <b>pull</b> production control in non-repetitive manufacturing systems is challenging, perplex and laborious. Secondly, the thesis examines three pull production control mechanisms namely, Kanban, Base Stock and Constant Work-in-Process (CONWIP) which it enhances so as to prevent system deadlocks, an issue largely unaddressed in the relevant literature. Having successfully tested the transferability of pull production control to non-repetitive manufacturing, the third contribution of this thesis is that it uses experimental and empirical data to examine the impact of pull production control on job-shop performance. The thesis identifies issues resulting from the <b>application</b> of <b>pull</b> control in job-shops which have implications for industry practice and concludes by outlining further research that can be undertaken in this direction...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{analytic}} model relating the mean cycle time or throughput {{as a function}} of the number of jobs in a closed production system composed of a tandem network of queues having exponential and/or IFR processing times. This model exhibits macroscopic behavior that is predicted by results from queueing theory and involves three meaningful parameters: the bottleneck rate and the "raw process" time that can be determined from first moment data; and a dimensionless congestion coefficient that is typically obtained from a single WIP/average cycle time observation (e. g., simulation). The derivation of the model is based on observations of the behavior of the relation between mean cycle time and WIP. This "engineering" approach is different from a purely "probabilistic" one in that we do not consider the distribution of processing times at individual station. We compare the accuracy of the model in predicting mean cycle times to other techniques such as mean value analysis and simulation. queues: approximations, cyclic, <b>applications,</b> inventory/production: <b>pull</b> systems...|$|R

Depending on the force level, force distribution along the aggregate, and the character of its anchoring to the substrate, the aggregate is predicted to exhibit distinct modes of assembly that are largely consistent with the experimentally observed FA behavior. We define here specific conditions that can lead to the different regimes of FA assembly, including growth, steady state, and disassembly...|$|R
