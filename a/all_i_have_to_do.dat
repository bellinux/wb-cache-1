In the footage, her stylist said that the {{inspiration}} for the video was [...] "trailer-trash, ghetto fabulous, out-there, [...] edgy." [...] During the footage Beyonc√© said [...] "I like this video. It's no choreography, no pressure. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is party and have a good time." [...] She also revealed that the video is supposed to reflect her simplistic childhood, adding: [...] "Growing up, I had really amazing parents and I had a great childhood. We went from nicer homes to being in apartments with our lights cutting off. It didn't matter where we were 'cause we had love and we had so much fun. It's great when you don't have as much how you improvise and you have more fun." ...|$|E
500|$|On February 12, 2012, Lil' Wayne {{said that}} Christina Milian had joined Young Money, and will release her fourth album through Young Money Entertainment. The next day, a song titled [...] "Mr. Valentine" [...] leaked onto the internet. Milian told Carson Daly on 97.1 AMP Radio. [...] "Yeah, I've signed with Young Money. It was pretty awesome. This weekend {{we had a}} big party, a big YMCMB party, and Drake was {{performing}} and we were all up on the stage and Wayne got up there and he announced it himself. And so I was kind of surprised and I was like, 'Oh my gosh, this is awesome!'" [...] Milian is currently recording her fourth album. [...] "We're just getting started on it," [...] she said. [...] "I've already halfway gotten there and when my mom and I went to Wayne and we played him some of the music, off the second song, he was like, 'I love it. Let's do this deal.' I have some music that's already going to be on it and the second half I'm working with them now. [...] When they did a little background check, they saw even the songwriting, {{all that kind of stuff}} adds on top of, alright, she's an actress, she's a pretty face, she can actually sing, but not to mention she's a songwriter. I thought that was cool that they even saw that. [...] They all get on each other's records, so <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is be home with everybody and we'll just do lots of features." ...|$|E
2500|$|One such {{threat was}} {{delivered}} by fur trader James McDougall, who {{is quoted as}} saying to a gathering of local chiefs, [...] "You know the smallpox. Listen: I am the smallpox chief. In this bottle I have it confined. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is to pull the cork, send it forth among you, and you are dead men. But this is for my enemies and not my friends." [...] Likewise, another fur trader threatened Pawnee Indians that if they didn't agree to certain conditions, [...] "he would let the smallpox out of a bottle and destroy them." [...] The Reverend Isaac McCoy was quoted in his History of Baptist Indian Missions as saying that the white men had deliberately spread smallpox among the Indians of the southwest, including the Pawnee tribe, and the havoc it made was reported to General Clark and the Secretary of War. [...] Artist and writer George Catlin observed that Native Americans were also suspicious of vaccination, [...] "They see white men urging the operation so earnestly they decide that it must be some new mode or trick of the pale face by which they hope to gain some new advantage over them." [...] So great was the distrust of the settlers that the Mandan chief Four Bears denounced the white man, whom he had previously treated as brothers, for deliberately bringing the disease to his people.|$|E
