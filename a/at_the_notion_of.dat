With an order due out for one of Phyllis Vance's (Phyllis Smith) most important clients, Andy asks for volunteers to step in {{for the day and}} make sure that the order is shipped out. Jim, Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) take over the process, (however, in a talking-head interview, Kevin states that he will deliberately do a poor job because he did not volunteer and was merely suggested for the job because of his large size), but {{do not know how to}} use the heavy-lifting equipment and balk <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> carrying all the heavy boxes by hand. Upon Kevin's suggestion, they create an oil luge to slide the boxes across the floor resulting in a lot of damaged inventory. They retool Kevin's idea throughout the day, resulting in still more damaged inventory, and Phyllis ultimately loses the client.|$|E

After some wariness <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> seeing the house rather than the books be a shrine to Wilder, Lane came to believe that making a museum of it would draw long-lasting attention to the books. She donated the money needed to purchase the house and make it a museum, agreed to make significant contributions each year for its upkeep, and gave many of her parents' belongings.|$|E

Mera relays to Tempest that Orin felt safe on land {{and that it is}} indeed what he wanted. Sometime later, a black power ring is seen {{entering}} Orin's grave, bidding him to rise. Aquaman's corpse rises, along with those of Tula and Dolphin as revenant members of the Black Lantern Corps, and demands that Mera reunite with him in death, offering her a chance to see her son again. Garth is killed and joins the Black Lanterns himself. Mera rejects the corpse before fleeing. In the climax of the miniseries, Aquaman is among those resurrected by The White Lantern Entity, and is reunited with Mera. Because the Black Lantern Ring helps reconstruct Orin's body, when he is resurrected his hand is restored as well.|$|E

McKinnell further proposes a connection between Irpa and Hel, stating that the two may {{have been seen as}} synonymous.|$|E
500|$|Aeschines Socraticus and Antisthenes each named a Socratic {{dialogue}} after Aspasia (though neither survives {{except in}} fragments). Our major sources for Aeschines Socraticus' Aspasia are Athenaeus, Plutarch, and Cicero. In the dialogue, Socrates recommends that Callias send his son Hipponicus to Aspasia for instructions. When Callias recoils <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> a female teacher, Socrates notes that Aspasia had favorably influenced Pericles and, after his death, Lysicles. In {{a section of}} the dialogue, preserved in Latin by Cicero, Aspasia figures as a [...] "female Socrates", counseling first Xenophon's wife and then Xenophon himself (the Xenophon in question is not the famous historian) about acquiring virtue through self-knowledge. Aeschines presents Aspasia as a teacher and inspirer of excellence, connecting these virtues with her status as hetaira. According to Kahn, every single episode in Aeschines' Aspasia is not only fictitious but incredible.|$|E
500|$|Born in Ararat, Victoria, the {{grandson}} of German immigrants, Fred Scherger was educated to junior certificate level at his local high school. His ancestry and surname made him the object of xenophobia in his childhood during World WarI, which carried on into {{the early part of}} his military career and beyond; as late as 1941, an anonymous letter writer from RAAF Station Wagga would tell Prime Minister Robert Menzies that his [...] "blood ran cold" [...] <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> someone called [...] "Scherger" [...] commanding trainee Australian pilots. Scherger nevertheless entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in 1921 and graduated as a lieutenant in 1924, winning the King's Medal. Two days prior to graduation, he volunteered for an Air Force secondment, which was later made permanent. He commenced his flight training as a pilot officer (temporary flying officer) in 1925 at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria.|$|E

500|$|Susan Hill herself did {{not like}} some of the changes that Kneale had made to The Woman in Black. It has been {{observed}} that Kneale on some occasions operated a double-standard with adaptations; being unhappy when others made changes to his stories, but willing to make changes to stories he was adapting into script form. Referring to The Woman in Black adaptation, the writer and critic Kim Newman noted that: [...] "He was very offended <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> Susan Hill using the name of Kipps from HG Wells as the hero of The Woman in Black, and so he decided not to use it and to change the hero's name to Kidd. I'm sure if somebody thought that Quatermass was a silly name and changed it, he'd be furious!" [...] However, Kneale's adaptations were by no means always unpopular with the original author. In 1991, a four-part version he wrote of Kingsley Amis's novel Stanley and the Women, met with approval from the original author, with Amis regarding it as the most successful adaptation of any of his work.|$|E

[...] Shortly after its defeat, one of the vampire sisters appears and disdains their efforts, saying their control is lessened in only a minor degree. [...] Later, when {{entering}} the second portrait, they find Brauner and the two twins; Brauner laughs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> reviving Dracula, as he has failed too many times to control humanity, but concedes his power is too great to ignore. [...] Both sisters desire to kill the two humans, but Brauner sees Dracula's servant Death as a greater threat, as he could wrest control from him far more easily than them. [...] While exploring the castle, Charlotte and Jonathan encounter Death, who acts as if Dracula were already revived. [...] When informed Dracula is still dead, and that another vampire is controlling the castle, he scoffs {{at the idea of}} a hand other than Dracula's to rule Castlevania. [...] Yet, he is gravely disturbed when he sees the statements are true, and promptly leaves to seek a way to destroy Brauner and revive Dracula.|$|E

Thus, over time, the strategy mix should evolve to some type of optimal or stable state. Maynard Smith and Price (1973) have introduced the concept of ESS (evolutionarily stable strategy) to describe a stable state of the game. We attempt to model {{the dynamics of the}} game both in the continuous case, with a system of non-linear first-order differential equations, and in the discrete case, with a system of non-linear difference equations.

We frame our work within <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> contexts, {{as a way to}} provide agents with local reasoning capabilities and to express their compatibilities. We believe distinguishability {{plays an important role in}} any effort to build or describe interaction between arbitrary agents. We show as well how <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> distinguishability can be used by agents to state in a local way their beliefs about other agents without having to reify their formulae. Finally, after giving a generic formalization and a simple example, we show how distinguishability can be formalized within a certain logic of context. Keywords: contexts, logics of context, distinguishability, granularity. 1 Introduction We firstly aim <b>at</b> formalizing <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> distinguishability.

2500|$|A complex Lie {{group is}} defined {{in the same way}} using complex {{manifolds}} rather than real ones (example: SL(2, C)), and similarly, using an alternate metric completion of Q, one can define a p-adic Lie group over the p-adic numbers, a topological group in which each point has a p-adic neighborhood. Hilbert's fifth problem asked whether replacing differentiable manifolds with topological or analytic ones can yield new examples. The answer to this question turned out to be negative: in 1952, Gleason, Montgomery and Zippin showed that if G is a topological manifold with continuous group operations, then there exists exactly one analytic structure on G which turns it into a Lie group (see also HilbertSmith conjecture). If the underlying manifold is allowed to be infinite-dimensional (for example, a Hilbert manifold), then one arrives <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> an infinite-dimensional Lie group.

2500|$|Chain {{complexes}} {{arise in}} abundance in algebra and algebraic topology. For example, if X is a topological space then the singular chains C'n(X) are formal linear combinations of continuous maps {{from the standard}} n-simplex into X; if K is a simplicial complex then the simplicial chains C'n(K) are formal linear combinations of the n-simplices of K; if A=F/R {{is a presentation of}} an abelian group A by generators and relations, where F is a free abelian group spanned by the generators and R is the subgroup of relations, then letting C1(A)=R, C0(A)=F, and C'n(A)=0 for all other n defines a sequence of abelian groups. In all these cases, there are natural differentials d'n making [...] C'n into a chain complex, whose homology reflects the structure of the topological space X, the simplicial complex K, or the abelian group A. In the case of topological spaces, we arrive <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> singular homology, which plays a fundamental role in investigating the properties of such spaces, for example, manifolds.|$|E

In {{the preface to}} his 1961 Pelican edition, (at which time, in Britain, proven male homosexuality still carried a prison sentence, dismissal from the professions and huge public stigma), Douglas Bush writes, [...] "Since modern readers are unused to such ardor in masculine friendship {{and are likely to}} leap <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> homosexuality (a notion sufficiently refuted by the sonnets themselves), we may remember that such an ideal, often exalted above the love of women, could exist in real life, from Montaigne to Sir Thomas Browne, and was conspicuous in Renaissance literature." [...] Richard Dutton writes that the Shakespearean scholar A. L. Rowse never accepted that the Bard was homosexual to any extent at all, writing that [...] "Shakespeare’s interest in the youth is not at all sexual". Dutton comments:Rowse’s conviction on this point remained unshaken to his death, which is odd, not least because he himself was widely understood to be homosexual and wrote openly about writers like Marlowe and Wilde. But Shakespeare for him was always unimpeachably heterosexual.|$|E

40|$|It {{is often}} argued that Utilitarianism is {{impractical}} because our actions have extremely complex and far-reaching sets of effects, thus making moral calculation impossible.
