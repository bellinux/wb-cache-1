2500|$|Suppose {{the current}} stock price of IBM is $100. A call or put option with a strike of $100 is <b>at-the-money.</b> A call with a strike of $80 is in-the-money (100 [...] 80 = 20 > 0). A put option with a strike at $80 is out-of-the-money (80 [...] 100 = 20 < 0). Conversely, a call option with a $120 strike is out-of-the-money and a put option with a $120 strike is in-the-money.|$|E
5000|$|A {{straddle}} {{is effectively}} a short iron butterfly without {{the wings and}} is constructed simply by purchasing an <b>at-the-money</b> call and an <b>at-the-money</b> put.

50|$|The typical {{shape of}} the implied {{volatility}} curve for a given maturity depends on the underlying instrument. Equities tend to have skewed curves: compared to <b>at-the-money,</b> implied volatility is substantially higher for low strikes, and slightly lower for high strikes. Currencies {{tend to have more}} symmetrical curves, with implied volatility lowest <b>at-the-money,</b> and higher volatilities in both wings. Commodities often have the reverse behavior to equities, with higher implied volatility for higher strikes.|$|E
5000|$|A short {{straddle}} {{is effectively}} a long iron butterfly without {{the wings and}} is constructed simply by writing an <b>at-the-money</b> call and an <b>at-the-money</b> put. Similar to a short strangle, the short straddle offers no protection to limit losses and similar to a long iron butterfly, the straddle requires the underlying instrument's spot price to remain virtually unchanged {{over the life of}} the contract in order to retain the full net credit.|$|E
50|$|The VIX has {{replaced}} the older VXO as the preferred volatility index used by the media. VXO was a measure of implied volatility calculated using 30-day S&P 100 index <b>at-the-money</b> options.|$|E
50|$|The put {{backspread}} is {{a strategy}} in options trading whereby the options trader writes a number of put options at a higher strike price (often <b>at-the-money)</b> and buys a greater number (often twice as many) of put options at a lower strike price (often out-of-the-money) of the same underlying stock and expiration date. Typically the strikes are selected such {{that the cost of}} the long puts is largely offset by the premium earned in writing the <b>at-the-money</b> puts. This strategy is generally considered very bearish but it can also serve as a neutral/bullish play under the right conditions.|$|E
50|$|The intuition {{behind that}} technique, {{when applied to}} derivatives, is the following: note {{that the source of}} the {{variance}} of a derivative will be directly dependent on the risks (e.g. delta, vega) of this derivative. This is because any error on, say, the estimator for the forward value of an underlier, will generate a corresponding error depending on the delta of the derivative with respect to this forward value. The simplest example to demonstrate this consists in comparing the error when pricing an <b>at-the-money</b> call and an <b>at-the-money</b> straddle (i.e. call+put), which has a much lower delta.|$|E

50|$|A cliquet option or ratchet {{option is}} an exotic option {{consisting}} {{of a series of}} consecutive forward start options. The first is active immediately. The second becomes active when the first expires, etc. Each option is struck <b>at-the-money</b> when it becomes active.|$|E
5000|$|The {{strike price}} X is usually {{set at the}} current value of the basket (<b>at-the-money),</b> and the payoff profile will be max(S - X) where S is a {{weighted}} average of n asset prices at maturity, and each weight represents the percentage of total investment in that asset.|$|E
50|$|Market {{practitioners}} use {{the term}} implied-volatility to indicate the volatility parameter for ATM (<b>at-the-money)</b> option. Adjustments to this value are undertaken by incorporating the values of Risk Reversal and Flys (Skews) to determine the actual volatility measure {{that may be used}} for options with a delta which is not 50.|$|E

50|$|This {{value is}} {{isolated}} via a straddle - purchasing an <b>at-the-money</b> straddle (whose value increases {{if the price}} of the underlying increases or decreases) has (initially) no delta: one is simply purchasing convexity (optionality), without taking a position on the underlying asset - one benefits from the degree of movement, not the direction.|$|E
50|$|Often {{the call}} {{with the lower}} {{exercise}} price will be <b>at-the-money</b> while the call with the higher exercise price is out-of-the-money. Both calls must have the same underlying security and expiration month. If the bull call spread is done so that both the sold and bought calls expire on the same day, it is a vertical debit call spread.|$|E
50|$|The PUT {{strategy}} {{is designed to}} sell a sequence of one-month, <b>at-the-money,</b> S&P 500 Index puts and invest cash at one- and three-month Treasury Bill rates. The number of puts sold varies from month to month, but is limited so that the amount held in Treasury Bills can finance the maximum possible loss from final settlement of the SPX puts. The PUT Index was introduced in 2007 by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). The Index is calculated and disseminated daily by the CBOE and the daily price history of the PUT Index dates back to June 30, 1986.|$|E
5000|$|Setting a low strike price. (An {{estimated}} 95 {{percent of}} corporations in America pay executives with [...] "at-the-money" [...] optionsâ€”i.e. options whose strike price {{is the same}} as the price of the stock on the date the option was granted, so that any move upward in stock price gives the options value. Many financial economists believe it [...] "highly unlikely" [...] that this same option design would be [...] "efficient in all cases", but <b>at-the-money</b> options give executives the biggest payout of any option price that is still eligible for tax deduction as [...] "incentive pay".) ...|$|E
5000|$|We {{can obtain}} a third {{view of the}} long box-option by reading the table diagonally. In order to {{interpret}} the diagonals, we need to introduce the straddle, which {{is a combination of}} a long call and a long put both at a strike price equal to the current stock price (<b>at-the-money).</b> This combination is direction neutral, its terminal payoff being dependent not on the direction of movement of the stock price but only on the magnitude of the movement. The band between the break-even points can be extended by separating the strike prices of the two options symmetrically with respect to the current stock price: ...|$|E
50|$|Gamma, , {{measures}} {{the rate of}} change in the delta with respect to changes in the underlying price. Gamma is the second derivative of the value function with respect to the underlying price. Most long options have positive gamma and most short options have negative gamma. Long options have a positive relationship with gamma because as price increases, Gamma increases as well, causing Delta to approach 1 from 0 (long call option) and 0 from -1 (long put option). The inverse is true for short options. Gamma is greatest approximately <b>at-the-money</b> (ATM) and diminishes the further out you go either in-the-money (ITM) or out-of-the-money (OTM). Gamma is important because it corrects for the convexity of value.|$|E
50|$|Suppose {{the current}} stock price of IBM is $100. A call or put option with a strike of $100 is <b>at-the-money.</b> A call with a strike of $80 is in-the-money (100 &minus; 80 = 20 > 0). A put option with a strike at $80 is out-of-the-money (80 &minus; 100 = &minus;20 < 0). Conversely, a call option with a $120 strike is out-of-the-money and a put option with a $120 strike is in-the-money.Though the above is a {{traditional}} way of calculating ITM, OTM and ATM, some new authors find the comparison of strike price with current market price meaningless and recommend the use of Forward Reference Rate instead of Current Market Price. For example, the option will be In The Money if Strike Price of Buy PUT on underlying {{is greater than the}} Forward Reference Rate.|$|E
5000|$|... 4. High Gross Monthly Premiums and Sources of Return. On average, {{selling the}} <b>at-the-money</b> put option each month earned a premium of 1.65% of the {{notional}} {{value of the}} index, which averaged 19.8% per year. The income return of 19.8% exceeds the total return of 10.3%, as a portion of premiums are paid to insure losses of the put buyers. The PUT Index had a higher Sharpe ratio, higher Sortino Ratio, and more negative skewness than the S&P 500 Index. A key source of excess returns for the PUT Index {{lies in the fact}} that index options have tended to trade at prices above their fair value, and so some sellers of short-term index options have been able to generate excess risk-adjusted returns. Annual income from the sale of put options is higher from the sale of 1-month options than the sale of longer maturity options.|$|E
50|$|In finance, {{a forward}} start option {{is an option}} that starts at a {{specified}} future date with an expiration date set further in the future. A forward start option starts at a specified date in the future; however, the premium is paid in advance, {{and the time of}} expiration is established at the time the forward start option is purchased. Since the asset price at the start of this option is not known a priori, it is common to specify that the strike price will be set in the future so that the option is initially at the money or a certain percentage in the money or out of the money. This contract can be used to give an investor exposure to forward volatility. Executive stock options {{can be viewed as a}} type of forward start option. This is because a company commits to granting <b>at-the-money</b> options to employees in the future.|$|E
50|$|In a low {{interest}} rate and high market volatility environment, reverse convertibles are popular as they provide much enhanced yield for the investors. By receiving enhanced coupons, investors {{take on the}} risk of losing part of the capital. Prior to the turn of the millennium (2000), reverse convertibles mostly consisted of investors shorting standard <b>at-the-money</b> (ATM) put options. Investors would lose capital if at maturity the underlying fell below the initial level. To increase the protection for investors, barrier reverse convertibles were introduced whereby investors were instead shorting ATM down-and-in put options. The additional barrier event increased the protection for the investors, as the put option would not come into effect unless the (down) barrier was hit. The barrier protection feature triggered much increased reverse convertible issuances in UK in the early 2000s {{as well as in the}} European retail markets. By the early 2010s, the (barrier) reverse convertibles were also among the most popular structured products in US.|$|E
50|$|The (absolute value of) Delta {{is close}} to, but not {{identical}} with, the percent moneyness of an option, i.e., the implied {{probability that the}} option will expire in-the-money (if the market moves under Brownian motion in the risk-neutral measure). For this reason some option traders use the absolute value of delta as an approximation for percent moneyness. For example, if an out-of-the-money call option has a delta of 0.15, the trader might estimate that the option has approximately a 15% chance of expiring in-the-money. Similarly, if a put contract has a delta of &minus;0.25, the trader might expect the option to have a 25% probability of expiring in-the-money. <b>At-the-money</b> puts and calls have a delta of approximately 0.5 and &minus;0.5 respectively with a slight bias towards higher deltas for ATM calls. The actual probability of an option finishing in the money is its Dual Delta, {{which is the first}} derivative of option price with respect to strike.|$|E
5000|$|When implied {{volatility}} is plotted against strike price, the resulting graph is typically downward sloping for equity markets, or valley-shaped for currency markets. For markets where the graph is downward sloping, such as for equity options, the term [...] "volatility skew" [...] is often used. For other markets, such as FX options or equity index options, where the typical graph turns up at either end, {{the more familiar}} term [...] "volatility smile" [...] is used. For example, the {{implied volatility}} for upside (i.e. high strike) equity options is typically lower than for <b>at-the-money</b> equity options. However, the implied volatilities of options on foreign exchange contracts tend to rise in both the downside and upside directions. In equity markets, a small tilted smile is often observed near the money as a kink in the general downward sloping implicit volatility graph. Sometimes the term [...] "smirk" [...] is used to describe a skewed smile.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the <b>at-the-money</b> strike derivative of implied volatility as the maturity tends to zero. Our main results quantify {{the behavior of}} the slope for infinite activity exponential LÃ©vy models including a Brownian component. As auxiliary results, we obtain asymptotic expansions of short maturity <b>at-the-money</b> digital call options, using Mellin transform asymptotics. Finally, we discuss when the <b>at-the-money</b> slope is consistent with the steepness of the smile wings, as given by Lee's moment formula...|$|E
40|$|We {{model the}} {{temporal}} {{properties of the}} first three moments of asset returns and examine whether incorporating time varying skewness in the underlying asset returns leads to profitable strategies using <b>at-the-money</b> S&P 500 index options. We devise trading rules that incorporate the skewness forecast to trade <b>at-the-money</b> delta-neutral strips, straps and straddles. We find that a simulated trading strategy using a model with both conditional volatility and skewness outperforms the GARCH model before and after adjusting for transaction costs. The results indicate that index option prices for <b>at-the-money</b> options do not reflect time varying skewness. The evidence suggests that mispricing of options may cause the negative skewness in the implicit risk-neutral distribution in option prices...|$|E
