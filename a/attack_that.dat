5|$|On 4 October 1918, the 24th Battalion {{took part}} in the <b>attack</b> <b>that</b> {{captured}} the Beaurevoir sector in France, and was, therefore, expecting to have a rest the following day when the unit was unexpectedly ordered to take part in another attack. The assault was to commence at 06:05 from the village of Remicourt, and lead to the capture of Montbrehain by the 21st and 24th Battalions with tanks to provide support. The action was to prove the final engagement for the Australian infantry during the war, and it was during this <b>attack</b> <b>that</b> Ingram was to earn the Victoria Cross; the sixty-fourth, and final, Australian to do so during the First World War.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland won the AAFC {{championship}} {{again in}} 1947 behind an offensive <b>attack</b> <b>that</b> employed the forward pass more frequently and effectively than was typical at the time.

5|$|Coulter's plan {{to attack}} on August 28 {{had to be}} postponed. Brigadier General Kim Hong Il, the ROK I Corps commander, {{told him he could}} not <b>attack,</b> <b>that</b> there were too many {{casualties}} and the South Korean were exhausted. The NK 5th Division above P'ohang-dong had begun to press south again and the ROK 3rd Division in front of it began to show signs of pulling back. On the 28th, the KMAG adviser to the ROK 3rd Division and Brigadier General Kim Suk Won clashed over whether the division should retreat or <b>attack.</b> <b>That</b> day, August 28, Walker issued a special statement addressed to the ROK Army, and meant also for the South Korean Minister of Defense, Shin Sung-mo. He called on the ROK troops to hold their lines in the Pusan Perimeter, and implored the rest of the UN troops to defend their ground as firmly as possible, counterattacking as necessary to prevent the North Koreans from consolidating their gains.|$|E

Years after her imprisonment, she {{maintained}} {{that she did}} not order Fischer's murder.

In a letter written to the press in 2013, he thanked God for saving his life after two ruptured stomach ulcers, and a heart <b>attack</b> <b>that</b> nearly killed him in 2012. He was imprisoned at the age of 42 and will not be eligible for parole until June 2028 (when he is 78 years old). He has spent time in several Texas prisons, including the Louis C.

5|$|After his {{two and a}} {{half years}} of training, Naruto returns to Konoha and begins to deal more {{actively}} with the Akatsuki threat by saving Gaara from their clutches. To fight them, Naruto trains with Kakashi to infuse the Rasengan with his own wind-element chakra, creating the Rasen-Shuriken <b>attack</b> <b>that</b> proves instrumental in the downfall of the Akatsuki member Kakuzu. Despite being targeted by the Akatsuki, Naruto dedicates himself to finding and retrieving Sasuke; he eventually disposes of Orochimaru and starts acting on his vengeance-driven whims. Over time, though resisting the urge to use the creature's power, the Nine Tails's influence over him expands to the point where he begins to lose his rationality as more chakra manifests in the form of tails to the point the Tailed Beast can take control of his body. This ultimately causes him to go on a rampage, destroying everything in his path.|$|E

In order to save valuable ammunition for the infantry <b>attack</b> <b>that</b> they knew would follow, the Army of the Potomac's artillery, under the command of Brig. Gen. Henry Jackson Hunt, at first did not return the enemy's fire. After waiting about 15 minutes, about 80 U.S. cannons added to the din. The Army of Northern Virginia was critically low on artillery ammunition, and the cannonade did not significantly affect the Union position.|$|E
