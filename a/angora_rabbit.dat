25|$|To make various yarns, besides adding novelty elements, spinners {{can vary}} {{all the same}} things as in a {{machined}} yarn, i.e., the fibre, the preparation, the colour, the spinning technique, {{the direction of the}} twist, etc. A common misconception is yarn spun from rolags may not be as strong, but the strength of a yarn is actually based on the length of hair fibre and the degree of twist. When working with shorter hairs, such as llama or <b>angora</b> <b>rabbit,</b> the spinner may choose to integrate longer fibres, such as mohair, to prevent yarn breakage. Yarns made of shorter fibres are also given more twist than yarns of longer fibres, and are generally spun with the short draw technique.|$|E

The rabbits are then thrown back into their cage and appear to be stunned and in shock." [...] PETA claimed that 90 percent of the world's angora comes from China, and retailers that carry angora did not initially comment to CBS. Over the next two years, though, because of the investigation, more than 70 retailers, including H, Topshop, and Inditex (the world's largest retailer), discontinued their use of angora. Inditex donated its angora products, valued at $878,000, to Syrian refugees.|$|E

50|$|Angoras are bred {{mainly for}} their wool, which is silky and soft. At only 11 microns in {{diameter}} it is finer and softer than cashmere. Most <b>Angora</b> <b>rabbits</b> are calm and docile, {{but should be}} handled carefully. Grooming is necessary to prevent the fiber from matting and felting on the rabbit. A condition, wool block, is common in <b>Angora</b> <b>rabbits,</b> and should be treated quickly. These rabbits are shorn every {{three to four months}} throughout the year.|$|R

60|$|The {{skull of}} the <b>Angora</b> <b>rabbit,</b> like the latter five skulls, is {{intermediate}} in general proportions, {{and in most}} other characters, between those of the largest lop-eared and wild rabbits. It presents only one singular character: though considerably longer than the skull of the wild rabbit, the breadth measured within the posterior supra-orbital fissures is nearly a third less than in the wild. The skulls of the silver-grey, and chinchilla and Himalayan rabbits are more elongated than in the wild, with broader supra-orbital plates, but differ little in any other respect, excepting that {{the upper and lower}} notches of the occipital foramen are not so deep or so well developed. The skull of the Moscow rabbit scarcely differs at all from that of the wild rabbit. In the Porto Santo feral rabbits the supra-orbital plates are generally narrower and more pointed than in our wild rabbits.|$|E
6000|$|I have {{previously}} remarked that, {{if we had}} possessed many domestic rabbits of the same average size with the wild rabbit, {{it would have been}} easy to compare the capacity of their skulls. Now the Himalayan, Moscow, and Angora rabbits (Nos. 11, 12, 13 of Table 3) are only a little larger in body and have skulls only a little longer, than the wild animal, and we see that the actual capacity of their skulls is less than in the wild animal, and considerably less by calculation (column 7), according to the difference in the length of their skulls. The narrowness of the brain-case in these three rabbits could be plainly seen and proved by external measurement. The Chinchilla rabbit (No. 14) is a considerably larger animal than the wild rabbit, yet the capacity of its skull only slightly exceeds that of the wild rabbit. The <b>Angora</b> <b>rabbit,</b> No. 13, offers the most remarkable case; this animal in its pure white colour and length of silky fur bears the stamp of long domesticity. It has a considerably longer head and body than the wild rabbit, but the actual capacity of its skull is less than that of even the little wild Porto Santo rabbits. By the standard of the length of skull the capacity (see column 7) is only half of what it ought to have been! I kept this individual animal alive, and it was not unhealthy nor idiotic. This case of the <b>Angora</b> <b>rabbit</b> so much surprised me, that I repeated all the measurements and found them correct. I have also compared the capacity of the skull of the Angora with that of the wild rabbit by other standards, namely, by the length and weight of the body, and by the weight of the limb-bones; but by all these standards the brain appears to be much too small, though in a less degree when the standard of the limb- bones was used; and this latter circumstance may probably be accounted for by the limbs of this anciently domesticated breed having become much reduced in weight, from its long-continued inactive life. Hence I infer that in the Angora breed, which is said to differ from other breeds in being quieter and more social, the capacity of the skull has really undergone a remarkable amount of reduction.] ...|$|E

6000|$|The hare-coloured, or, {{as it is}} {{sometimes}} called, the Belgian rabbit, differs in nothing except colour from the other large breeds; but Mr. J. Young, of Southampton, a great breeder of this kind, informs me that the females, in all the specimens examined by him, had only six mammae; and this certainly {{was the case with}} two females which came into my possession. Mr. B.P. Brent, however, assures me that the number is variable with other domestic rabbits. The common wild rabbit always has ten mammae. The <b>Angora</b> <b>rabbit</b> is remarkable from the length and fineness of its fur, which even on the soles of the feet is of considerable length. This breed is the only one which differs in its mental qualities, for it is said to be much more sociable than other rabbits, and the male shows no wish to destroy its young. (4/9. 'Journal of Horticulture' 1861 page 380.) Two live rabbits were brought to me from Moscow, of {{about the size of the}} wild species, but with long soft fur, different from that of the Angora. These Moscow rabbits had pink eyes and were snow-white, excepting the ears, two spots near the nose, the upper and under surface of the tail, and the hinder tarsi, which were blackish-brown. In short, they were coloured nearly like the so-called Himalayan rabbits, presently to be described, and differed from them only in the character of their fur. There are two other breeds which come true to colour, but differ in no other respect, namely silver-greys and chinchillas. Lastly, the Nicard or Dutch rabbit may be mentioned, which varies in colour, and is remarkable from its small size, some specimens weighing only 1 1/4 pounds; rabbits of this breed make excellent nurses for other and more delicate kinds.
