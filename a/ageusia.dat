25|$|Dysgeusia, {{also known}} as parageusia, is a {{distortion}} {{of the sense of}} taste. Dysgeusia is also often associated with <b>ageusia,</b> which is the complete lack of taste, and hypogeusia, which is a decrease in taste sensitivity. An alteration in taste or smell may be a secondary process in various disease states, or it may be the primary symptom. The distortion in the sense of taste is the only symptom, and diagnosis is usually complicated since the sense of taste is tied together with other sensory systems. Common causes of dysgeusia include chemotherapy, asthma treatment with albuterol, and zinc deficiency. Different drugs could also be responsible for altering taste and resulting in dysgeusia. Due to the variety of causes of dysgeusia, there are many possible treatments that are effective in alleviating or terminating the symptoms of dysgeusia. These include artificial saliva, pilocarpine, zinc supplementation, alterations in drug therapy, and alpha lipoic acid.|$|E
2500|$|Taste or {{gustation}} (adjectival form: gustatory) {{is one of}} {{the traditional}} five senses. It refers to the capability to detect the taste of substances such as food, certain minerals, and poisons, etc. The sense of taste is often confused with the [...] "sense" [...] of flavor, which is a combination of taste and smell perception. Flavor depends on odor, texture, and temperature as well as on taste. Humans receive tastes through sensory organs called taste buds, or gustatory calyculi, concentrated on the upper surface of the tongue. There are five basic tastes: sweet, bitter, sour, salty and umami. Other tastes such as calcium and free fatty acids may also be basic tastes but have yet to receive widespread acceptance.

50|$|Taste loss {{can vary}} from true aguesia, a {{complete}} loss of taste, to hypogeusia, a partial loss of taste, to dysgeusia, a distortion or alteration of taste. The primary cause of <b>ageusia</b> involves damage to the lingual nerve, which receives the stimuli from taste buds for the front two-thirds of the tongue, or the glossopharyngeal nerve, which acts similarly for the back third. Damage {{may be due to}} neurological disorders, such as Bell’s palsy or multiple sclerosis, as well as infectious diseases such as meningoencephalopathy.

With more severe inhalation exposure, the airway becomes inflamed, pneumonia develops, and the respiratory epithelium can begin to have necrosis and slough off, forming a pseudomembrane that can occlude the airway. This occlusion can be fatal, as can the pneumonia.|$|E
50|$|Tissue {{damage to}} the nerves that support the tongue can cause <b>ageusia,</b> {{especially}} {{damage to the}} chordatympani nerve and the glossopharyngeal nerve.

Neurological disorders such as Bell's palsy, Familial dysautonomia, and Multiple sclerosis cause similar problems to nerve damage, as do certain infectious conditions like primary amoeboid meningoencephalopathy. The lingual nerve (which is {{a branch of the}} trigeminal V3 nerve, but carries taste sensation back to the chorda tympani nerve to the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve) can also be damaged during otologic surgery, causing a feeling of metal taste.|$|E

40|$|Five {{percent of}} the general {{population}} has olfactory or gustatory disorders, although most do not complain about it. However, in some cases, these symptoms can be disabling and may affect quality of life. Anosmia was reported as a possible complication following head injury and neurosurgical procedures, particularly after the resection of tumors located in the anterior fossa and the treatment of aneurysms in the anterior circulation. Nonetheless, in all of these situations, olfactory dysfunction could be explained by damage to the peripheral olfactory system. Here, the authors report a case of complete anosmia associated with <b>ageusia</b> following awake resection of a low-grade glioma involving the left temporoinsular region, with no recovery during a follow-up of 3 years. The frontal lobe was not retracted, and the olfactory tract was not visualized during surgery; therefore, postoperative anosmia and <b>ageusia</b> are likely explained by damage to the cortex and central pathways responsible for these senses. The authors suggest that the patient might have had a subclinical right hemianosmia before surgery, which is a common condition. After resection of the central structures critical for smell and taste processing in the left hemisphere, the patient could have finally had bilateral and complete olfactory and gustatory loss. This is the first known report of permanent anosmia and <b>ageusia</b> following glioma surgery. Because these symptoms might have been underestimated, more attention should be devoted to olfaction and taste, especially with regard to possible subclinical preoperative deficit. ([URL]...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Anosmia, {{the loss}} of the sense of smell, is a rare adverse event {{associated}} with interferon alpha (INF-a). Millions of patients with hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are currently treated with INF-alfa- 2 a daily. Only 5 cases of anosmia {{have been reported in the}} literature, and none was associated with pegylated INF-alfa. Case summary: A 55 -year-old Arab male (height, 5 ' 1 "; weight, 81 kg) with chronic HCV developed anosmia and <b>ageusia</b> (loss of the sense of taste) after 36 weeks of treatment for HCV with subcutaneous pegylated INF-alfa- 2 a 180 μg and ribavirin 1200 mg. Treatment was continued for 12 additional weeks before being discontinued. Twenty-four weeks after treatment was discontinued, HCV-RNA was undetectable and, during the same visit, the patient reported that he had regained his sense of smell a few weeks previously. The Naranjo algorithm score was 7, representing a probable association of anosmia with INF-alfa- 2 a treatment. Other etiologies for loss of smell and taste were ruled out. Conclusions: We report a case of anosmia and <b>ageusia</b> in a patient treated with pegylated INF-alfa- 2 b and ribavirin for HCV infection.

40|$|Background Burning mouth {{syndrome}} (BMS) is a chronic, intraoral {{burning sensation}} seen mainly in middle-aged and post-menopausal females, without identifiable oral lesions or abnormal laboratory findings, but {{often associated with}} psychogenic disorders such as depression. The latter can {{have a range of}} causes, including hormonal. Objective Since there may be connections between BMS, psychogenic changes, hormonal changes and taste abnormalities, we have examined aspects of taste and thyroid function [...] Patients and methods We selected 50 patients with BMS (study group) and 50 healthy subjects (control group) and analysed their ability to taste bitter, acid and spicy substances and analysed their thyroid function and Undertook thyroid echography. Results Taste sensation was normal in all controls. However, 30 of the patients with BMS reported <b>ageusia</b> for bitter taste and 2 had <b>ageusia</b> for acid. The use of pepper sauce (Tabasco®) (spicy substance) produced a strong burning to the tongue in 28 patients of the BMS group but only in 10 controls. No control patients showed abnormality of thyroid function or echograpic abnormality. Five patients in the BMS group had biochemical evidence of hypothyroidism, 4 patients had raised levels of thyroid autoantibodies and, of the 41 remaining BMS patients, most (34) had thyroid echographic changes indicative of nodularity.

40|$|The {{perception}} of sour taste in humans is incompletely understood at the receptor cell level. We report here on two patients with an acquired sour <b>ageusia.</b> Each patient was unresponsive to sour stimuli, but both showed normal responses to bitter, sweet, and salty stimuli. Lingual fungiform papillae, containing taste cells, {{were obtained by}} biopsy from the two patients, and from three sour-normal individuals, and analyzed by RT-PCR. The following transcripts were undetectable in the patients, even after 50 cycles of amplification, but readily detectable in the sour-normal subjects: acid sensing ion channels (ASICs) 1 a, 1 beta, 2 a, 2 b, and 3; and polycystic kidney disease (PKD) channels PKD 1 L 3 and PKD 2 L 1. Patients and sour-normals expressed the taste-related phospholipase C-beta 2, the delta-subunit of epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and the bitter receptor T 2 R 14, as well as beta-actin. Genomic analysis of one patient, using buccal tissue, did not show absence of the genes for ASIC 1 a and PKD 2 L 1. Immunohistochemistry of fungiform papillae from sour-normal subjects revealed labeling of taste bud cells by antibodies to ASICs 1 a and 1 beta, PKD 2 L 1, phospholipase C-beta 2, and delta-ENaC. An antibody to PKD 1 L 3 labeled tissue outside taste bud cells. These data suggest a role for ASICs and PKDs in human sour perception.

40|$|SUMMARY- A {{review is}} {{presented}} of the drug-induced gustatory disorders that {{have so far}} been identified. Metallic, bitter or salty phantogeusias and hypogeusias, often of a dissociated type, which may even develop into <b>ageusia</b> {{have been described as}} side effects of treatment with some drugs. Personal observations on six cases are reported in which the gustatory disorders are attributed to the ingestion of phenylbutazone, carbarnazepine, chlormezanone and bac 1 ofen.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Chorda tympani injury as a {{complication}} of middle-ear surgery {{has been extensively}} studied with regard to its effects upon taste. However, the chorda tympani also carries parasympathetic fibres to the salivary glands of the oral cavity. To date, little has been reported {{about the effect of}} chorda tympani section upon salivary function. SETTING: Tertiary care centre. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We report a case series of three patients with bilateral chorda tympani lesions. Chorda tympani function was assessed using 'taste strips' and unstimulated sialometry. A careful history of oral symptoms was taken. RESULTS: All patients showed transient or permanent bilateral <b>ageusia</b> of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, and a decreased resting salivary flow rate. In addition, all patients suffered from transient or persistent, distressing xerostomia. CONCLUSION: Taste disorders may occur after middle-ear surgery but they are mostly transient, even when the chorda tympani nerves are sectioned bilaterally. In contrast, bilateral chorda tympani lesions may lead to severe, persistent and distressing xerostomia. Based on this neglected aspect of chorda tympani function, we emphasise the importance of preserving the chorda tympani whenever possible...|$|E
40|$|Taste is a {{chemical}} sense responding to chemical stimuli. In our daily practice as ENT practitioners or Neurologists we do come across patients complaining of taste disturbances. Tests for taste {{have to be}} performed regularly in the clinical centres as well as in neurological labs as a part of complete work up for neurotology cases. Assessment of taste sensation can be easily done in a neurological clinic by chemogustometry as described by Claussen. The stimuli used are chemicals, representative substances for the four qualities of sweet, salty, sour and bitter, in graded solutions. These semi-quantitative results are plotted on a pentagon scheme devised by Claussen. The points of the best results for glucose, sodium chloride, citric acid, phenylthio-urea and quinine then are connected with a coloured line. That gives a linked graphic structure, which can be read by the physician at one glance. Different patterns are obtained for normal taste, taste-blindness for phenylthio-urea, <b>ageusia,</b> partial ageusias for glucose, or sodium chloride or citric acid or quinine or their combinations and parageusias. In this article we present different patterns of taste disturbances depicted on the pentagon chart highlighting the easy interpretation of chemogustometry...|$|E
40|$|SummaryMany {{studies have}} shown the {{consequent}} gustatory alteration caused by ear surgeries. However, few have reported this alteration in patients with chronic otitis media (COM), prior to surgical treatment. Aimto identify gustatory alterations due to chorda tympani nerve involvement in patients with COM without prior surgery. MethodsClinical essay, with tests based on “taste strips” with different concentrations of salt, sweet, bitter, and sour, was performed in 45 patients with unilateral cholesteatomatous or suppurated COM not previously submitted to otological surgery, using the disease-free ear on the contralateral side as control. The score ranged between 0 and 16. ResultsA total of 25 patients presented cholesteatoma and 20 had non-cholesteatomatous disease. The mean score was 6. 65 for the affected side and 9. 93 for the half of the tongue {{on the side of}} the healthy ear (p< 0. 001). No patients had complained of gustatory alterations before the examination. Among the 24 patients with unilateral hypogeusia, eight cases of unilateral <b>ageusia</b> were found on the affected side. There was an association between cholesteatoma (p= 0. 055), disease duration (p= 0. 07) and worsening in gustatory sensitivity.

40|$|Micturitional {{disturbance}} {{is rarely}} mentioned in human herpetic brainstem encephalitis although the pontine tegmentum, called the pontine micturition centre, seems {{to regulate the}} lower urinary tract in experimental animals. The case of a 45 year old man, who developed subacute coma and hiccup-like dysrhythmic breathing, and needed assisted ventilation is reported. Examination of CSF showed mononuclear pleocytosis and antibody against herpes simplex virus type 1, but the opening pressure was 90 cm H 2 O. Brain CT showed brain swelling, predominantly in the posterior fossa, and bilateral subdural effusion. Herpetic brainstem encephalitis was diagnosed, and he received 900 mg/day vidarabine. On regaining consciousness, he had left trochlear nerve palsy, left corectopia, <b>ageusia,</b> and urinary retention. Brain MRI showed right side dominant, bilateral pontine segmental lesions extending slightly to the midbrain and medulla. After two weeks {{he was able to}} urinate but showed nocturnal urinary frequency, urinary incontinence, and voiding difficulty. Urodynamic studies showed a residual urine volume of 350 ml and detrusor hyporeflexia on voiding. Micturitional disturbance gradually disappeared together with the neurological signs. The bilateral pontine tegmental lesions in this patient are similar to those in previous findings on brainstem strokes, evidence of the presence of a pontine micturition centre in humans. ...|$|E
30|$|Moreover, {{several studies}} have {{demonstrated}} an altered food preference in cancer, and food-related quality of life depending on treatment or disease stage (Epstein et al. 2002; Hovan et al. 2010). Patients with head and neck cancers had altered food-related expectations {{and changes in the}} “meaning of food” resulting in physical, emotional and social losses (McQuestion et al. 2011). Following curative gastrectomy, patients experienced increased dysphagia, eating restriction, anxiety, taste changes, and body image scores which gradually decreased over 12  months (Kong et al. 2012). Radiotherapy is also well known to impair taste perception during and after cancer treatment (e.g., Ruo Redda and Allis 2006; Irune et al. 2014). Taste changes and food preferences are also expressed differently according to chemotherapy (CT) regimen with significant relationships between <b>ageusia</b> and dry mouth, bitter taste and appetite loss, sour taste and nausea, and anorexia and dry mouth (Zabernigg et al. 2010). As highlighted by recent systematic reviews, the influence of CT changes in food preferences have not been consistently demonstrated (Epstein and Barasch 2010; Boltong and Keast 2012; Gamper et al. 2012). Finally, {{the extent to which these}} disturbances play a role in dietary behavior during and after treatment remains relatively unknown. Despite randomized trials of dietary counseling compared to no dietary counseling or to standard practice (e.g., Isenring et al. 2007), there is a lack of information concerning practical management of food intake, particularly meal and food preferences in a cultural context among cancer patients undergoing treatment.|$|E
