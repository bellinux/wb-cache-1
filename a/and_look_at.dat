5|$|Unusual social {{development}} becomes apparent early in childhood. Autistic infants show {{less attention to}} social stimuli, smile <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms; for example, they have less eye contact and turn-taking, {{and do not have}} the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things. Three- to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form attachments to their primary caregivers. Most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD. Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person's own emotions.|$|E

25|$|Social psychologists {{therefore}} {{deal with}} the factors that lead us to behave in a given way {{in the presence of}} others, <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the conditions under which certain behavior/actions and feelings occur. Social psychology is concerned with the way these feelings, thoughts, beliefs, intentions and goals are constructed and how such psychological factors, in turn, influence our interactions with others.|$|E
25|$|All {{the members}} of the troop are {{interested}} in the newborn, and they take advantage of any opportunity to examine <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> its genitals if the mother permits it. With time the baby begins to climb up on other members of the troop, including the adult males who are interested in protecting the little one. Playing behavior is principally with a companion, and all members of the troop from the alpha male, the mother and all young members of the group solicit play with the young one.|$|E
25|$|Mammals have {{demonstrated}} grief-like states, especially between {{a mother and}} her offspring. She will often stay close to her dead offspring for short periods of time and may investigate the reasons for the baby's non-response. For example, some deer will often sniff, poke, <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> its lifeless fawn before realising it is dead and leaving it to rejoin the herd shortly afterwards. Other animals, such as a lioness, will pick up its cub in its mouth and place it somewhere else before abandoning it.|$|E

25|$|In December 2012, the Canadian {{government}} decided that F-35 costs were {{much higher than}} earlier anticipated and hence {{are looking at the}} Eurofighter as well as four other fighters to replace their ageing CF-18s. In January 2014 it seemed unlikely that a decision on a replacement would be taken before the next federal election in October 2015. This election occurred, and while Canada was leaning more towards US fighters like the F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet or back to the F-35, as of June 2017 protectionist rhetoric by the US government (and a trade complaint by Boeing against Bombardier) has caused the Canadian government to stop discussions about acquiring the Super Hornet <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> other, potentially non-US options.|$|E
25|$|Eve is {{the second}} human created by God, taken from one of Adam's ribs and shaped into a female form of Adam. Far from the {{traditional}} model of a good wife, she is often unwilling to be submissive towards Adam. She is more intelligent and curious about external ideas than her husband. Though happy, she longs for knowledge and, more specifically, self-knowledge. Her first act in existence is {{to turn away from}} Adam <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> and ponder her own reflection. Eve is extremely beautiful and thoroughly in love with Adam, though may feel suffocated by his constant presence. In Book IX, she convinces Adam that {{it would be good for}} them to split up and work different parts of the Garden. In her solitude, she is tempted by Satan to sin against God. Adam shortly follows along with her.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, the {{majority}} of chapters fell below minimum chapter size, were in violation of hazing or alcohol policy or did not meet financial obligations. This caused many programs such as Compass Point and Reflections to help chapters grow <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> chapter life. The National Office also began to improve communication {{through the development of}} a national website. In 2003, a fine was instated for chapters with a number of girls under the campus total number of girls possible to recruit. This controversial fine was created with the intention of keeping chapters active in recruitment. The following year a GPA minimum and value based recruitment system were in place as a way to strengthen chapter membership. Theta Phi Alpha approved the expansion of its Grand Council from five to seven members in 2006 to have more of a focus on assisting chapters as well.|$|E

25|$|Matt McCoy, {{a senior}} walk-on, {{is a young}} man that has been working for {{the last three or four}} years. We would {{certainly}} not take a redshirt off Sherrod Harris at this point; it would be unfair for him because he has sat this year with the idea that he'll start the spring as a redshirt freshman. And then Mack (Brown) and I will sit down and discuss the possibility of an emergency situation as we've done in the past; one year Tony Jeffrey worked as quarterback for us because he had played quarterback in high school. So we'll sit down <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> some different options as to which way we would go. It would certainly be somebody that we think can run the offense and have a limited package for those guys. I don't think we'll need an emergency quarterback, but we'll certainly have a third guy ready.|$|E
25|$|Each launch system {{incorporates}} three rails, i.e. {{one system}} carries three missiles. This allows a single aircraft to carry {{large numbers of}} missiles; for example, a Typhoon could carry up to six launch systems, one each on six individual pylons, which gives a maximum payload of eighteen Brimstone missiles, {{in addition to a}} useful air-to-air payload. The missile is carried by the Tornado GR4 in RAF service. In February 2014 the National Audit Office warned of a possible capability gap under existing plans to fit Brimstone to Typhoon in 2021, two years after the Tornado retired; in June 2014 the MoD announced a study to accelerate this to 2018 <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a common launcher that could also launch SPEAR Cap 3. MBDA have fired test rounds from an MQ-9 Reaper and are studying the use of Brimstone on attack helicopters and from surface launchers. Both the US and France have expressed interest in buying it for their aircraft.|$|E
25|$|People {{with only}} a casual concern for Internet privacy need not achieve total anonymity. Internet users may protect their privacy through {{controlled}} disclosure of personal information. The revelation of IP addresses, non-personally-identifiable profiling, and similar information might become acceptable trade-offs for the convenience that users could otherwise lose using the workarounds needed to suppress such details rigorously. On the other hand, some people desire much stronger privacy. In that case, they may try to achieve Internet anonymity to ensure privacy — use of the Internet without giving any third parties the ability to link the Internet activities to personally-identifiable information of the Internet user. In order to keep their information private, {{people need to be}} careful with what they submit to <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> online. When filling out forms and buying merchandise, that becomes tracked and because the information was not private, some companies are now sending Internet users spam and advertising on similar products.|$|E

[...] The 2004 film Alien vs. Predator featured an icebreaker named the Piper Maru, the naming of the ship being a nod to this episode.|$|E
