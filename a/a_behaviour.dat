5|$|Beagles may exhibit <b>a</b> <b>behaviour</b> {{known as}} reverse sneezing, {{in which they}} sound {{as if they are}} choking or gasping for breath, but are {{actually}} drawing air in through the mouth and nose.

5|$|Antbirds are diurnal: they feed, breed {{and defend}} territories during the day. Many {{of the family}} are, however, {{reluctant}} to enter areas of direct sunlight where it breaks through the forest canopy. Antbirds will engage in anting, <b>a</b> <b>behaviour</b> in which ants (or other arthropods) are rubbed on the feathers before being discarded or eaten. While this has conventionally been considered a way to remove and control feather parasites, {{it has been suggested}} that for antbirds it may simply be a way to deal with the distasteful substances in prey items.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that a {{considerable}} amount of research has considered the relationship between <b>A</b> type <b>behaviours</b> and specific aspects of physical health few studies have looked at the relationship between <b>A</b> type <b>behaviours,</b> mental health and health beliefs. This study set out to determine the relationship between type <b>A</b> <b>behaviours,</b> psychological disturbance and various health locus of control beliefs in a heterogeneous population. It was hypothesized that although A type individuals would have higher disturbance scores, they would have higher internal locus of control beliefs across all subscale scores. The results showed that A type individuals had significantly higher mental distress scores than B types, however there was no relationship between health locus of control beliefs and the <b>A</b> type <b>behaviour</b> pattern. The findings are discussed in terms of the coping strategies of the A type individual. ...|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> skill-based <b>behaviour</b> {{represents}} <b>a</b> type of <b>behaviour</b> {{that requires}} very {{little or no}} conscious control to perform or execute an action once an intention is formed; also known as <b>a</b> sensorimotor <b>behaviour.</b> Performance is smooth, automated, and consists of highly integrated patterns of behaviour in most skill-based control (Rasmussen, 1990). For example, bicycle riding is considered <b>a</b> skill-based <b>behaviour</b> in which very little attention is required for control once the skill is acquired. This automaticity allows operators to free up cognitive resources, which can then be used for higher cognitive functions like problem solving (Wickens & Hollands, 2000).|$|R
5|$|Day-to-day {{killer whale}} {{behaviour}} generally consists of foraging, travelling, resting and socializing. Killer whales engage in frequent behaviour {{at the surface}} such as breaching (jumping {{completely out of the}} water) and tail-slapping. These activities may have a variety of purposes, such as courtship, communication, dislodging parasites, or play. Spyhopping, <b>a</b> <b>behaviour</b> in which a whale holds its head above water, helps the animal view its surroundings.|$|E
5|$|Despite being quadrupedal the {{ring-tailed lemur}} can rear up and balance {{on its hind}} legs, usually for {{aggressive}} displays. When threatened the ring-tailed lemur may jump {{in the air and}} strike out with its short nails and sharp upper canine teeth in <b>a</b> <b>behaviour</b> termed jump fighting. This is extremely rare outside of the breeding season when tensions are high and competition for mates is intense. Other aggressive behaviours include a threat-stare, used to intimidate or start a fight, and a submissive gesture known as pulled-back lips.|$|E
5|$|Displays are {{classified}} as deimatic or aposematic by {{the responses of the}} animals that see them. Where predators are initially startled but learn to eat the displaying prey, the display is classed as deimatic, and the prey is bluffing; where they continue to avoid the prey after tasting it, the display is taken as aposematic, meaning the prey is genuinely distasteful. However, these categories are not entirely mutually exclusive. It is possible for <b>a</b> <b>behaviour</b> to be both deimatic and aposematic, if it both startles a predator and indicates the presence of anti-predator adaptations.|$|E
40|$|By {{means of}} the perturbative {{renormalization}} group method, we study <b>a</b> long-time <b>behaviour</b> of some symplectic discrete maps near elliptic and hyperbolic fixed points. It is shown that a naive renormalization group (RG) map breaks the symplectic symmetry and fails to describe <b>a</b> long-time <b>behaviour.</b> In order to preserve the symplectic symmetry, we present a regularization procedure, which gives a regularized symplectic RG map describing <b>an</b> approximate long-time <b>behaviour</b> succesfully. ...|$|R

5|$|Feathers require {{maintenance}} and birds preen or groom them daily, spending {{an average of}} around 9% of their daily time on this. The bill is used to brush away foreign particles and to apply waxy secretions from the uropygial gland; these secretions protect the feathers' flexibility and act as an antimicrobial agent, inhibiting the growth of feather-degrading bacteria. This may be supplemented with the secretions of formic acid from ants, which birds receive through <b>a</b> <b>behaviour</b> known as anting, to remove feather parasites.|$|E
5|$|In most media appearances, pterosaurs {{are most}} often {{depicted}} as piscivores, <b>a</b> <b>behaviour</b> only a few groups actually had in reality. They are also often shown as aerial predators similar to birds of prey, grasping human victims with their taloned feet. No pterosaur species known so far possesses prehensile feet; all known pterosaurs have flat, plantigrade feet with no opposable toes, often poorly muscled and, {{in the case of}} pteranodontians, generally proportionally small. However, some pterosaurs might have had raptorial tendencies; Thalassodromeus possesses powerful jaws akin to those of phorusrhacids, and Hatzegopteryxs short neck and more powerful jaws have been interpreted as a speciation on larger prey.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species can}} roll {{themselves}} into a ball, <b>a</b> <b>behaviour</b> used in defence that also conserves moisture. Members of the families Ligiidae and Tylidae, commonly known as rock lice or sea slaters, are the least specialised of the woodlice for life on land. They inhabit the splash zone on rocky shores, jetties and pilings, may hide under debris washed up on the shore and can swim if immersed in water.|$|E

5|$|Meat ants {{have been}} {{observed}} blocking banded sugar ant nesting holes with pebbles and soil {{to prevent them from}} leaving their nest during {{the early hours of the}} day. The ants counter this by preventing meat ants from leaving their nest by blocking their nesting holes with debris, <b>a</b> <b>behaviour</b> known as nest-plugging. If meat ant nests are encroached by trees or other shade, banded sugar ants may invade and take over the nest, since the health of the colony may deteriorate from overshadowing. Members of an affected meat ant colony later move to a nearby satellite nest that is placed in a suitable area, while invading banded sugar ants fill nest galleries up with a black resinous material.|$|E
5|$|The kakapo has a {{well-developed}} {{sense of}} smell, which complements its nocturnal lifestyle. It can distinguish between odours while foraging, <b>a</b> <b>behaviour</b> reported {{in only one}} other parrot species. One {{of the most striking}} characteristics of the kakapo is its distinct musty-sweet odour. Given their well-developed sense of smell, this odour may be a pheromone. The smell often alerts predators to the presence of kakapos.|$|E
5|$|The third suborder, Sirenoidea, {{contains}} the four species of sirens, {{which are in}} a single family, Sirenidae. Members of this order are eel-like aquatic salamanders with much reduced forelimbs and no hind limbs. Some of their features are primitive while others are derived. Fertilisation {{is likely to be}} external as sirenids lack the cloacal glands used by male salamandrids to produce spermatophores and the females lack spermathecae for sperm storage. Despite this, the eggs are laid singly, <b>a</b> <b>behaviour</b> not conducive for external fertilisation.|$|E

5|$|Another {{interesting}} {{habit of}} males {{of this and}} other fairywren species during the reproductive season is to pluck petals (in this species, predominantly pink and purple ones which contrast with their plumage) and show them to female fairywrens. Petals often form part of a courtship display and are presented to a female in the male fairywren's own or another territory. Outside the breeding season males may sometimes still show petals to females in other territories, presumably to promote themselves. It is notable that fairywrens are socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous: pairs will bond for life, but regularly mate with other individuals; a proportion of young will have been fathered by males from outside the group. Young are often raised not by the pair alone, but with other males who also mated with the pair's female assisting. Thus, petal-carrying might be <b>a</b> <b>behaviour</b> that strengthens the pair-bond. Petal carrying might also be a way for extra males to gain matings with the female. In either case, the data does not strongly link petal-carrying and presenting to a copulation soon thereafter.|$|E
5|$|In 1986 Charig and Milner first {{suggested}} that its elongated snout with many finely serrated teeth indicated that Baryonyx was piscivorous (a fish-eater), speculating that it crouched on a riverbank and used its claw to gaff {{fish out of}} the water (similar to the modern grizzly bear). In 1984, Taquet pointed out that the spinosaurid snouts from Niger were {{similar to those of the}} modern gharial and suggested <b>a</b> <b>behaviour</b> similar to herons or storks. In 1997 Charig and Milner rejected their initial proposal that the articulation between the premaxilla and maxilla was mobile. In 1987 Andrew Kitchener disputed the piscivorous behaviour of Baryonyx and {{suggested that}} it would have been a scavenger, using its long neck to feed on the ground, its claws to break into a carcass, and its long snout (with nostrils far back for breathing) for investigating the body cavity. Kitchener argued that Baryonyx jaws and teeth were too weak to kill other dinosaurs and too heavy to catch fish, with too many adaptations for piscivory. According to R. E. H. Reid, a scavenged carcass would have been broken up by its predator and large animals capable of doing so—such as grizzly bears—are also capable of catching fish (at least in shallow water).|$|E

5|$|Most {{species are}} diurnal, and forage {{on the ground}} or onto low {{vegetation}} in search of food, but a few are nocturnal and only forage at night. Most Myrmecia ants are active during the warmer months, and are dormant during winter. However, M. pyriformis is a nocturnal species that is active throughout the whole year. M. pyriformis also has a unique foraging schedule; 65% of individuals who went out to forage left the nest in 40–60 minutes, while 60% of workers would return to the nest in the same duration of time at dusk. Foraging workers rely on landmarks for navigation back home. If displaced a short distance, they will scan their surroundings, and then rapidly move {{in the direction of the}} nest. M. vindex ants carry dead nest-mates out of their nests and place them on refuse piles, <b>a</b> <b>behaviour</b> known as necrophoresis.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to other}} hyenas, the spotted hyena shows a greater {{relative}} amount of frontal cortex which {{is involved in}} the mediation of social behavior. Studies strongly suggest convergent evolution in spotted hyena and primate intelligence. A study done by evolutionary anthropologists demonstrated that spotted hyenas outperform chimpanzees on cooperative problem-solving tests; captive pairs of spotted hyenas were challenged to tug two ropes in unison to earn a food reward, successfully cooperating and learning the maneuvers quickly without prior training. Experienced hyenas even helped inexperienced clan-mates to solve the problem. In contrast, chimps and other primates often require extensive training, and cooperation between individuals is not always as easy for them. The intelligence of the spotted hyena was attested to by Dutch colonists in 19th-century South Africa, who noted that hyenas were exceedingly cunning and suspicious, particularly after successfully escaping from traps. Spotted hyenas seem to plan on hunting specific species in advance; hyenas have been observed to indulge in activities such as scent marking before setting off to hunt zebras, <b>a</b> <b>behaviour</b> which does not occur when they target other prey species. Also, spotted hyenas have been recorded to utilise deceptive behaviour, including giving alarm calls during feeding when no enemies are present, thus frightening off other hyenas and allowing them to temporarily eat in peace. Similarly, mothers will emit alarm calls in attempting to interrupt attacks on their cubs by other hyenas.|$|E
