5|$|Tom Kilburn {{was born}} in Dewsbury, Yorkshire, on 11 August 1921, the only son of John William Kilburn, <b>a</b> <b>wool</b> mill clerk who later became a company secretary, and his wife, Ivy Mortimer. From 1932 to 1940, he {{attended}} the Wheelwright Grammar School for Boys, where the headmaster encouraged his aptitude for mathematics. He also played sports, notably running.|$|E
5|$|Coarse or {{carpet wool}} sheep are {{those with a}} medium to long length wool of {{characteristic}} coarseness. Breeds traditionally used for carpet wool show great variability, but the chief requirement is <b>a</b> <b>wool</b> that will not break down under heavy use (as would that of the finer breeds). As the demand for carpet-quality wool declines, some breeders {{of this type of}} sheep are attempting to use a few of these traditional breeds for alternative purposes. Others have always been primarily meat-class sheep.|$|E
5|$|In 1945 Paton began {{construction}} of <b>a</b> <b>wool</b> factory at Darlington and a Rayon factory at Carrickfergus, both jobs were completed in 1951. In 1946 Paton {{was put in}} charge of an economic survey of Syria which required him to traverse the country by aircraft and car. The report, issued in 1947, recommended port, water infrastructure and irrigation improvements and the {{construction of}} a hydroelectric power station on the Euphrates River. Paton undertook a similar survey in Lebanon from 1947 to 1948. He was also involved in a report on the possibility of running a railroad from Northern Rhodesia to Dar es Salaam, Mtwara and Nyasaland.|$|E

50|$|When World War II {{broke out}} in 1939, Peal was {{stationed}} on the Shetland Islands. During this time he supplied his store with sweaters knitted from the wool of Shetland sheep. <b>As</b> <b>wool</b> was being rationed during wartime Peal was able to harness the demand for high quality knitwear in Britain.|$|R

5|$|Robert Blackman {{joined the}} crew {{prior to the}} start of the season as costume designer. He had been {{recommended}} by his predecessor, Durinda Rice Wood. He later recalled that he wasn't interested in the job and only took the interview as a favor, but he was so struck by producer David Livingston's enthusiasm that he accepted the post. One of his tasks was to redesign the Starfleet costumes which had been used for the first two seasons. The previous versions were made of spandex and caused back problems in the cast. The new costumes cost $3,000, and were made out of <b>a</b> <b>wool</b> gabardine.|$|E
5|$|All these {{increasingly}} {{long distances}} {{came at a}} price, as illustrated by filmmaker Werner Herzog in his 1974 documentary The Great Ecstasy of Woodcarver Steiner. During both the aforementioned events in Oberstdorf and Planica, several athletes including Steiner had far exceeded {{the limits of the}} hill by 'out-jumping' it or simply 'running out of slope'. Jumps were much further than in the 1950s, during which the old Kongsberger technique was still in use. The results were now potentially fatal each time: athletes were coming only metres away from landing on completely flat ground, or the equivalent of falling from a multi-storey building. Furthermore, only <b>a</b> <b>wool</b> cap and goggles – or no headgear at all – were worn; an antiquated feature left unchanged from the very earliest days of ski jumping more than 150 years prior. In 1979, at their 32nd International Ski Congress in Nice, France, the FIS mandated helmets to be worn by athletes at all ski jumping and flying events.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Reed {{had five}} sons, {{the third of}} whom, Charles Reed (1819–81), was apprenticed in 1836 to <b>a</b> <b>wool</b> {{manufacturer}} in Leeds, Yorkshire, where he also became secretary of the local Sunday School union. Through this work he met Edward Baines, proprietor of the Leeds Mercury one of the town's two MPs. The Baines family had a strong tradition of public and political service; both of Edward Baines's sons followed him into Parliament, the elder, Matthew Talbot Baines, eventually reaching Cabinet rank. Charles Reed was attracted to the youngest Baines offspring, a daughter, Margaret, whom he married in 1844. By this time Charles had left the wool industry and returned to London, where he founded his first business, a printing firm.|$|E

50|$|Spinning {{count is}} a measure of fibre {{fineness}} and distribution developed by the English. It is defined as the number of hanks of yarn that can be spun from <b>a</b> pound of <b>wool.</b> <b>A</b> hank of <b>wool</b> is 560 yards long (560 yd/lb = 1.129 km/kg). In theory a pound of 62s wool could produce 34720 yards of yarn.|$|R
5|$|Ford {{was born}} Leslie Lynch King Jr. on July 14, 1913, at 3202 Woolworth Avenue in Omaha, Nebraska, where his parents {{lived with his}} {{paternal}} grandparents. His mother was Dorothy Ayer Gardner and his father was Leslie Lynch King Sr., <b>a</b> <b>wool</b> trader and a son of prominent banker Charles Henry King and Martha Alicia King (née Porter). Dorothy separated from King just sixteen days after her son's birth. She took her son {{with her to the}} Oak Park, Illinois, home of her sister Tannisse and brother-in-law, Clarence Haskins James. From there, she moved to the home of her parents, Levi Addison Gardner and Adele Augusta Ayer, in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Dorothy and King divorced in December 1913, and she gained full custody of her son. Ford's paternal grandfather Charles Henry King paid child support until shortly before his death in 1930.|$|E
5|$|The town {{is still}} largely {{dependent}} on industry, {{along with the}} neighbouring towns Taunton and Bridgwater with manufacturing industries identified within the county economic strategy as key centres for further economic development, due to good transport links. Swallowfield plc benefited from the growth of own-brand products during the 1970s and now produces aerosol, cosmetic and toiletry products. It was founded in 1876 as Walter Gregory & Co Ltd who manufactured animal husbandry products. The company diversified and in 1950 produced the first commercial aerosols in the UK which were basically farm products, air fresheners and insecticides. Bed manufacturers Relyon employ some 400 people. The company started in 1858 as <b>a</b> <b>wool</b> merchant, Price Brothers and Co., but the business soon moved into manufacturing beds and in 1935 {{changed its name to}} Relyon Ltd. In 2001 it was acquired by Steinhoff International Holdings Ltd., a quoted South African group.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 15th and early 16th centuries, the Hussey family owned the manor of Old Sleaford. John Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford was {{executed}} for treason {{for his part}} in the Lincolnshire Rising. The manor and his residence at Old Place reverted to the Crown and were later sold to Robert Carre. George Carre or Carr from Northumberland had settled in Sleaford by 1522 when he was described as <b>a</b> <b>wool</b> merchant. His son Robert bought Hussey's land and the castle and manor of New Sleaford from Edward Clinton, 1st Earl of Lincoln. His eldest surviving son Robert, founded Carre's Grammar School in 1604, and his youngest son Edward was created a baronet; his son founded Sleaford Hospital in 1636. The last male descendent died in 1683 and the heiress, Isabella Carre, married John Hervey, Earl of Bristol, in whose family the estates remained until the 1970s. The Carres and Herveys had a strong influence: in addition to extracting dues from their tenants, they took leading tradesmen to the Exchequer Court to gain legal force behind their monopoly on charging tolls on market and cattle traders and for driving animals through the town.|$|E

25|$|A great wheel (also called <b>a</b> <b>wool</b> wheel, high wheel {{or walking}} wheel) is {{advantageous}} {{when using the}} long-draw technique to spin wool or cotton because the high ratio between the large wheel and the whorl (sheave) enables the spinner to turn the bobbin faster, thus significantly speeding up production.|$|E
25|$|Montgomery was {{incorporated}} as a borough by the Pennsylvania General Assembly on March 27, 1887 from part of Clinton Township. The {{history of the}} settlement of Montgomery begins in 1783, when John Lawson established a homestead there. Nicholas Shaffer built a gristmill in Montgomery in 1795. A sawmill and <b>a</b> <b>wool</b> carding mill were other early industries found on Black Hole Creek which flows through Montgomery.|$|E
25|$|The airline was {{provided}} with <b>a</b> <b>wool</b> store as their first hangar by a Winton local, Alba Woolscour. On 7 February 1921, {{the first and}} only Qantas board meeting in Winton was held in the Winton Club, three days after the pilots landed, on 10 February. A quick decision was made to move Qantas headquarters to Longreach, which would be more central to operations, with easier access to passengers and spare parts.|$|E

25|$|In 1995 AFFCO {{closed the}} Waitara {{works with the}} {{consequent}} severe loss of employment in the town. The shutdown followed the closure of a Swanndri clothing factory, a small-scale but locally significant Subaru car assembly plant and <b>a</b> <b>wool</b> scouring plant. The number of registered unemployed in the town rose from 700 to 1000, helping to boost the unemployment rate for the Taranaki region, which includes New Plymouth and Waitara, to 9.8 percent, compared with {{the national average of}} 6.7 percent.|$|E

Her husband successfully traded as Henry Wills & Co and profited from his local investments.
