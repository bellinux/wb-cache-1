5|$|Brotherhood {{is set on}} the Earth-like {{world of}} Eos, {{occurring}} within the events of Final Fantasy XV. The kingdom of Lucis, keeper of the world's last surviving magical crystal, has been {{at war with the}} technologically-advanced empire of Niflheim, the latter dominating much of the known world. After many years of war, a peace is agreed between Lucis and Niflheim. As part of the peace agreements, Noctis Lucis Caelumson of the reigning King Regis and heir to the Lucian throneis to marry Lunafreya Nox Fleuret, former princess of Tenebrae and now hostage of Niflheim. Noctis sets off to marry Lunafreya in the company of his loyal companions and friends: Gladiolus Amicitia, Prompto <b>Argentum,</b> and Ignis Scientia. On their journey, Niflheim betrays and invades Lucis, stealing the crystal and killing Regis, leaving Noctis to go on a quest to reclaim his throne and defeat Niflheim.|$|E
25|$|The story {{revolves}} around {{a conflict between}} Lucis, the last free kingdom in the world, and the expansionist empire of Niflheim. The main protagonist is Noctis Lucis Caelum, sole {{heir to the throne}} of Lucis. On his journey, he is accompanied by three companions: Gladiolus Amicitia, a brother-figure from a noble family sworn to Noctis's protection; Ignis Scientia, Noctis's strategist; and Prompto <b>Argentum,</b> a friend of Noctis from a lower-class family. A key character is Lunafreya Nox Fleuret, Noctis's fiancée through an arranged marriage. Other characters include Noctis's father Regis, the king of Lucis; Cor Leonis, a famous warrior of Lucis; Gentiana, Lunafreya's companion and attendant; Cindy, who with her grandfather Cid acts as mechanic for Noctis' car; and Iris, Gladiolus's sister. Characters from Niflheim serve as the game's main antagonists, including emperor Iedolas Aldercapt, his chancellor Ardyn Izunia, Lunafreya's brother Ravus Nox Fleuret, and mercenary dragoon Aranea Highwind.|$|E
25|$|The {{two main}} {{characters}} are Noctis Lucis Caelum, {{the crown prince}} of Lucis and the sole playable character who lost his father in the Niflheim invasion, and his fiancée Lunafreya Nox Fleuret, an Oracle and a former princess of Tenebrae. Noctis is accompanied on his journey by three others: Gladiolus Amicitia, Noctis’ bodyguard; Ignis Scientia, a prodigy military tactician and Noctis’ advisor; and Prompto <b>Argentum,</b> a friend of Noctis from a lower social class. Guest characters include Cor Leonis, a legendary warrior of Lucis who acts as a guardian to Noctis’ party, and Iris Amicitia, Gladiolus’ sister. Other key characters are Regis Lucis Caelum CXIII, king of Lucis and Noctis’ father, Gentiana, Lunafreya's attendant; and Cid Sophiar and his granddaughter Cindy Aurum, mechanics who maintain the party's car. The empire of Niflheim is ruled by Emperor Iedolas Aldercapt. Aldercapt's allies include Ardyn Izunia, the imperial chancellor and the game's main antagonist; Ravus Nox Fleuret, Lunafreya's brother and the high commander of the imperial army; Verstael Besithia, the empire's head researcher; and Aranea Highwind, a mercenary dragoon in service to Niflheim.|$|E

40|$|Forty two {{strains of}} Trichoderma sp. were {{isolated}} from cultivated lands around Bangalore andanalyzed for their antagonistic potential against Sclerotium rolfsii and Fusarium ciceri. The potential ofbiocontrol agents ultimately lies in {{their capacity to}} control pathogens in vivo. Bioefficacy studies were henceconducted using chickpea (Cicer <b>argentums</b> c. v. Annigeri) as an experimental plant by the roll paper towelmethod. Overall the isolates T 40, T 35, T 30 and T 25 showed better antagonistic potential in addition toenhancing plant growth. The production of chitinases {{to break down the}} mycelial cell walls of fungal plantpathogens has been implicated as a major cause of biocontrol activity (Inbar and Chet, 1995). In order tostudy the mechanism of biocontrol, ten better performing strains were plated on media, amended withcolloidal chitin and Sclerotium rolfsii cell wall extract. All the isolates showed chitinolytic activity on day threeas well as day five. Production of endochitinase and exochitinase were assayed in liquid media usingcolloidal chitin amended broth. Strains T 35 and T 6 displayed maximum endochitinase and exochitinaseactivity. Although all strains exhibited cellulase activity, the quantum of enzyme produced was higher in T 35 and T 6.

But in an ensuing battle, the enemy manage {{separate}} Chor Tempest forcing {{two of its}} sibyllae, Rimone and Dominūra, to in desperation perform the Emerald Ri Mājon. They succeed, but disappear without a trace. Chor Tempest retreats to secure Simulacrum's holiest site, the Ruins. There, Aer and Neviril learn that Emerald Ri Mājon allows the sibyllae piloting the Simoun to travel through time. Rimone and Dominūra are shown to have landed {{in the distant past}} where they pass on the knowledge of the Emerald Ri Mājon. Chor Tempest continue to fight as they slowly retreat back, and eventually Simulacrum sues for peace. The allied Plumbish and <b>Argentum</b> forces demand in their terms that all sibyllae become adults by visiting the holy Spring, thereby no longer being able to pilot Simoun. While the members Chor Tempest head off to the Spring, Aer and Neviril stay back and soon confess their feelings for each other. The allied occupation arrest them, however with the help of their former choirmates and the Plumbish priestesses, Aer and Neviril break free and say their farewells. Performing the Emerald Ri Mājon, the two vanish in a flash of light.|$|E
500|$|The word [...] "silver" [...] {{appears in}} Anglo-Saxon in various spellings, such as seolfor and siolfor. A similar form is seen {{throughout}} the Germanic languages (compare Old High German silabar and silbir). The chemical symbol Ag {{is from the}} Latin word for [...] "silver", <b>argentum</b> (compare Ancient Greek ἄργυρος, árgyros), from the Proto-Indo-European root *h₂erǵ- (formerly reconstructed as *arǵ-), meaning [...] "white" [...] or [...] "shining": this was the usual Proto-Indo-European word for the metal, whose reflexes are missing in Germanic and Balto-Slavic. The Balto-Slavic words for silver are quite similar to the Germanic ones (e.g. Russian серебро , Polish srebro, Lithuanian sidabras) {{and they may have}} a common origin, although this is uncertain: some scholars have suggested the Akkadian sarpu [...] "refined silver" [...] as this origin, related to the word sarapu [...] "to refine or smelt".|$|E
500|$|In {{the context}} of XV, [...] "Stand by Me" [...] was not {{intended}} as a love song, {{but rather as a}} message or prayer of gratitude from Noctis to all who had supported him on his journey, including Lunafreya, his father Regis and his three companions Gladiolus Amicitia, Ignis Scientia and Prompto <b>Argentum.</b> [...] Welch's contribution is notable as Final Fantasy theme songs have traditionally been performed by Asian singers, with the exception of XIII which had the Leona Lewis single [...] "My Hands" [...] substituted for [...] "Kimi ga Iru Kara" [...] in its English release. In addition to the cover for [...] "Stand by Me", Florence and the Machine created two original songs inspired by the world and story of XV, also sung by Welch: [...] "Too Much Is Never Enough" [...] and [...] "I Will Be".

40|$|Edible bird’s nest (EBN) is {{originated}} from the saliva of swiftlet. There are four species of swiftlet which are Collocalia fuciphaga, Collocalia germanis, Collocalia maxima and Collocalia unicolor. Collocalia fuciphaga {{is the common}} species {{which can be found}} in Malaysia. EBN consists mainly of amino acids, carbohydrates and mineral salts but it major ingredients were protein. Protein from EBN can be extracted by water, acid, alkaline and enzymatic hydrolysis method. This study focused on alkaline hydrolysis using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) at 50 °C. Prior to alkaline hydrolysis, pre-treatment method (EBN cleaning by soaked with water, feathers removal and fine plumage from EBN sample) has been carried out. The effect of extraction time, NaOH concentration and liquid solid ratio (LSR) on protein concentration have been determined during alkaline hydrolysis. The optimum condition of alkaline hydrolysis has been identified using response surface methodology (RSM). From the experimental result, it showed that the maximum protein concentration was at 25 minutes of extraction time, 30 : 1 of LSR and 100 g/L NaOH concentration. However, increased in LSR and NaOH concentration were increased the protein concentration. The optimum condition of protein concentration was 1. 260 g/L during alkaline hydrolysis using RSM were found at 25 minutes of extraction time, 100 g/L NaOH concentration and 30 : 1 of LSR. From the ANOVA result, the significant factor was extraction time (p= 0. 0187) and was clearly showed that further increased in extraction time (25 minutes) resulted in decreased in protein concentration due to the degradation of amino acid structure at long duration of extraction time. The FTIR spectrums of the untreated and treated sample resulted in the different trend of spectrum. In the treated sample after pre-treatment process and alkaline hydrolysis, it is showed that N-H and C=O stretching peak is increased. Besides, it was confirmed that the material was correspond to amides as it consists of C=O stretch. While, from the analysis using the ICP-MS, amount of cadmium, arsenic and lead in the sample was 0. 002 mg/L, 0. 00006 mg/L and 0. 262 mg/L respectively after pre-treatment. It also showed that percentage decreasing of <b>argentums,</b> cadmium and magnesium is the highest compared to others metal which were 99 %, 97. 70 % and 97. 24 % respectively. It can be concluded that EBN can be performed as an alternative source for protein...|$|R

60|$|The {{above-mentioned}} manors {{are charged}} with rents from five to an hundred pounds each. The greatest number of those I have seen in print are under fifty; {{so that we may}} safely take that number as a just medium; and then the whole amount of the demesne rents will be 70,000l., or 210,000l. of our money. This, though almost a fourth less than the sum stated by Vitalis, still seems a great deal too high, if we should suppose the whole sum, as that author does, to be paid in money, and that money to be reckoned by real pounds of silver. But we must observe, that, when sums of money are set down in old laws and records, the interpretation of those words, pounds and shillings, is for the most part oxen, sheep, corn, and provision. When real coin money was to be paid, it was called white money, or <b>argentum</b> album, and was only in a certain stipulated proportion to what was rendered in kind, and that proportion generally very low. This method of paying rent, though it entirely overturns the prodigious idea of that monarch's pecuniary wealth, was far from being less conducive to his greatness. It enabled him to feed a multitude of people,--one of the surest and largest sources of influence, and which always outbuys money in the traffic of affections. This revenue, which was the chief support of the dignity of our Saxon kings, was considerably increased by the revival of Danegelt, of the imposition of which we have already spoken, and which is supposed to have produced an annual income of 40,000l. of money, as then valued.|$|E
