500|$|In the summer, {{water would}} be used to sluice and pan the dirt, {{separating}} out the heavier gold from gravel. This required miners to construct sluices, which were sequences of wooden boxes [...] long, through which the dirt would be washed; up to 20 of these might be needed for each mining operation. The sluices in turn required lots of water, usually produced by creating a dam and ditches or crude pipes. [...] "Bench gold" [...] mining on the hill sides could not use sluice lines because water could not be pumped that high up. Instead, these mines used rockers, boxes that moved back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cradle, to create the motion needed for separation. Finally, the resulting gold dust could be exported out of the Klondike; exchanged for paper money at the rate of $16 ($430) per troy ounce (ozt) through one of the major banks that opened in Dawson City, or simply used as money when dealing with local traders.|$|E
500|$|Players {{dispatch}} enemies {{by either}} thrusting {{at them with}} his Dragon Sword or by defeating them using Power Boosting Items. These special items consume Ryu's [...] "ninja power", also located {{on the top of}} the screen. Power Boosting Items include the following: shurikens; [...] "Windmill Throwing Stars" [...] that move back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> boomerang; [...] "The Art of the Fire Wheel" [...] which hurls fireballs diagonally upwards; [...] "Fire Dragon Balls" [...] which hurls fireballs diagonally downwards; and the [...] "Invincible Fire Wheel" [...] that creates a barrier of three fireballs around Ryu, destroying any enemy that touches them. These items can be found in various crystal balls scattered throughout the levels, and they can be switched out by collecting another Power Boosting Item. The amount of ninja power used depends on the type of Power Boosting Item used. At the end of each Act Ryu fights a boss which has its own strength meter, located {{on the top of the}} screen. The boss's strength meter decreases every time the player damages it, and the boss is destroyed when the player completely depletes its strength meter.|$|E
500|$|Verlaine and Lloyd interplayed their guitars {{around the}} rhythm section's drum hits and basslines. Their dual playing drew on 1960s rock and avant-garde jazz styles, abandoning the layered power chords of {{contemporary}} punk rock {{in favor of}} melodic lines and counter-melodies. Verlaine established the song's rhythmic phrase, against which Lloyd played dissonant melodies. Lloyd had learned to notate his solos {{by the time they}} recorded Marquee Moon, allowing him to develop his solo for a song from introduction to variation and resolution. The two traded rhythmic and melodic lines several times on some songs while producing tension. [...] "There weren't many bands where the two guitars played rhythm and melody back <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> jigsaw puzzle", Lloyd said. Most of the solos on Marquee Moon followed a pattern wherein Verlaine ran up a major scale but regressed slightly after each step. On [...] "See No Evil", he soloed through a full octave before playing a blues-influenced riff, and on the title track, he played in a Mixolydian mode and lowered the seventh by half a step. Lloyd opened [...] "Friction" [...] by playing octaves before Verlaine's ringing harmonics and series of descending scales.|$|E
60|$|Impelled by {{the blows}} that rained upon him, now from this side, now from that, White Fang swung back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> erratic <b>and</b> jerky pendulum. Varying were the {{emotions}} that surged through him. At first, he had known surprise. Then came a momentary fear, when he yelped several times {{to the impact of}} the hand. But this was quickly followed by anger. His free nature asserted itself, and he showed his teeth and snarled fearlessly {{in the face of the}} wrathful god. This but served to make the god more wrathful. The blows came faster, heavier, more shrewd to hurt.|$|R

40|$|Building {{structures}} possessing vertical stiffness irregularity with an {{open ground}} storey are common in areas of low and moderate seismicity. These types of structures translate back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> inverted pendulum during earthquake shaking, with the columns in the open storey often susceptible to severe damage and collapse. This paper presents an overview of a collaborative research project which has been undertaken by Swinburne University of Technology and The University of Melbourne, Australia. The paper presents outcomes of unique experimental field testing on a four-storey soft storey building in Melbourne. The major aim of the project is to study the load deflection behaviour of soft storey buildings when subjected to lateral loading and to assess the lateral load and drift capacity. The results from the field test {{will be used to}} develop a representative seismic performance assessment procedure for soft storey buildings subject to different levels of ground shaking using force and displacement principles...|$|R

5000|$|The {{use of the}} tri-oval {{shape for}} {{automobile}} racing was conceived by Bill France, Sr. during the planning for Daytona.

60|$|So Peter said good-by {{and kept}} on down the Laughing Brook to the Smiling Pool. Right where the Laughing Brook entered the Smiling Pool {{there was a little}} pebbly beach. Running along {{the very edge of the}} water was a slim, trim little bird with fairly long legs, a long slender bill, brownish-gray back with black spots and markings, and a white {{waistcoat}} neatly spotted with black. Every few steps he would stop to pick up something, then stand for a second bobbing up and down in the funniest way, as if his body was so nicely balanced on his legs that it teetered back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> seesaw. It was Teeter the Spotted Sandpiper, an old friend of Peter's. Peter greeted him joyously.|$|E

I was so frightened that my wits seemed to leave me. I tramped and tramped, back <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> crazy person.

His voice was hollow, like the klonk of an old raven, and he was hunger-mad. His eyes were like live coals of fire, and as his body rocked to and fro, so rocked his soul inside. And I, too, said, 'Let us go on.' For that one thought, laid upon me like a lash for every mile of fifteen hundred miles, had burned itself into my soul, and I think that I, too, was mad. Besides, we could only go on, for there was no grub. And we went on, giving no thought to {{the man with the}} one eye in the snow.|$|E

There was flash on flash against the clouds, and rush on rush of shadows {{down the valley}} till the shaws were full of his hounds giving tongue, and the woodways were packed with his knights in armour riding down into the water-mists--all his own Magic, of course. Behind them you could see great castles lifting slow and splendid on arches of moonshine, with maidens waving their hands at the windows, which all turned into roaring rivers; and then would come the {{darkness}} of his own young heart wiping out the whole slateful. But boy's Magic doesn't trouble me--or Merlin's either for that matter. I followed the Boy by the flashes and the whirling wildfire of his discontent, and oh, but I grieved for him! Oh, but I grieved for him! He pounded back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bullock in a strange pasture--sometimes alone--sometimes waist-deep among his shadow-hounds--sometimes leading his shadow-knights on a hawk-winged horse to rescue his shadow-girls.

They say that till Witta took his sword to the rowers he could not bring his ship inshore; and each one of the four archers said {{afterwards}} that he alone had pierced the Devil that fought me. I do not know. I went to it in my mail-shirt, which saved my skin. With long-sword and belt-dagger I fought for the life against a Devil whose very feet were hands, and who whirled me back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> dead branch. He had me by the waist, my arms to my side, when an arrow from the ship pierced him between the shoulders, and he loosened grip. I passed my sword twice through him, and he crutched himself away between his long arms, coughing and moaning. Next, as I remember, I saw Thorkild of Borkum, bare-headed and smiling, leaping up and down before a Devil that leaped and gnashed his teeth. Then Hugh passed, his sword shifted to his left hand, and I wondered why I had not known that Hugh was a left-handed man; and thereafter I remembered nothing till I felt spray on my face, and we were in sunshine on the open sea. That was twenty days after.' ...|$|E

2500|$|Stepper motors can {{be rotated}} to a {{specific}} angle in discrete steps with ease, and hence stepper motors are used for read/write head positioning in computer floppy diskette drives. They {{were used for the}} same purpose in pre-gigabyte era computer disk drives, where the precision and speed they offered was adequate for the correct positioning of the read/write head of a hard disk drive. As drive density increased, the precision and speed limitations of stepper motors made them obsolete for hard drives—the precision limitation made them unusable, and the speed limitation made them uncompetitive—thus newer hard disk drives use voice coil-based head actuator systems. (The term [...] "voice coil" [...] in this connection is historic; it refers to the structure in a typical (cone type) loudspeaker. This structure was used for a while to position the heads. Modern drives have a pivoted coil mount; the coil swings back <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> something <b>like</b> <b>a</b> blade of a rotating fan. Nevertheless, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> voice coil, modern actuator coil conductors (the magnet wire) move perpendicular to the magnetic lines of force.) ...|$|R

50|$|The Matrix uses a {{spool valve}} system to propel a paintball. The spool valve {{utilizes}} an airspace with a fixed volume and a regulated air source {{to deliver a}} consistent amount of force to each ball that is shot. The valve works {{in the matter of}} a spool that slides back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> much <b>like</b> <b>a</b> piston. In one position the spool allows the fixed air chamber to be filled. In the firing position the spool moves forward and dumps the contents of the fixed air chamber into the breech of the marker, which in turn fires the paintball. The movement of the spool is controlled by the flow of air to it. This flow of air is controlled by a solenoid (electronically actuated valve). The Matrix has a sleek look and lacks external hoses that can become damaged over time. The gas is instead routed through passages inside the body of the marker and plugs in the front and rear of the marker keep these passages airtight. A low pressure regulator can also be attached {{to the front of the}} marker to help the consistency and help lower the force of the air hitting the ball.|$|R

50|$|The SDS shank has the {{advantage}} of fitting into a simple spring-loaded chuck, so that bits are simply pushed into the chuck without tightening. This shank and chucks made for it are especially suited to hammer drilling with masonry drills in stone and concrete. The drill bit is not held solidly in the chuck, but can slide back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> piston; it does not slip during rotation due to the non-circular shank cross-section, matching the chuck. The hammer of the drill acts to accelerate only the drill bit itself, and not the large mass of the chuck, which makes hammer drilling with an SDS shank drill bit much more productive than with other types of shank.|$|E
50|$|To {{achieve the}} layered dough for plain parathas, {{a number of}} {{different}} traditional techniques exist. These include covering the thinly rolled out pastry with oil, folding back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> paper fan and coiling the resulting strip into a round shape before rolling flat, baking on the tava and shallow frying. Another method is to cut a circle of dough from the centre to its circumference along its radius, oiling the dough and starting at the cut edge rolling so as to form a cone which is then squashed into a disc shape and rolled out. The method of oiling and repeatedly folding the dough as in western puff pastry also exists, and this is combined with folding patterns that give traditional geometrical shapes to the finished parathas. Plain parathas can be round, heptagonal, square, or triangular.|$|E

5000|$|WXRV (The River 92.5 FM) is {{an adult}} album {{alternative}} radio station based in Andover, Massachusetts, with a signal covering most of northeast Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire, and audible {{as far away}} as Plymouth, Massachusetts. Originating in 1947 as WHAV, an AM station in Haverhill, an FM station was founded in 1948, but went dark in the early 1950s. The FM station was restored on its current frequency in 1959; it became soft rock-formatted WLYT (Lite 92.5) in 1983, and gained its current identity as WXRV on August, 1, 1995, presumably taking the River moniker from the nearby Merrimack River (though with its wider reach, it uses Boston's Charles River for publicity purposes), but some say that the [...] "river" [...] moniker is for its diverse format of music that winds back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> flowing <b>like</b> <b>a</b> river. Despite the station's transmitter location, WXRV attempts to primarily serve the Greater Boston area; its signal also reaches into the nearby Manchester and Portsmouth markets. To overcome signal issues near Boston, the station applied for four on-channel booster stations in the Boston and metro-west areas in August 2015. The studios are still located in Haverhill, in the original WHAV art deco building. The current station inherited a facility {{on the top floor of}} its studio now called the River Music Hall, which was designed for broadcasting live performances in the pre-rock era, and is used today to broadcast live performances and to record performances for later broadcast.|$|R
