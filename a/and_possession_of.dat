5|$|Nathan Johnson {{was charged}} with simple {{possession}} of methamphetamine <b>and</b> <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> a firearm by a convicted felon, and received a $10,000 bond at a bond hearing. Some media outlets said the low bond amount indicated authorities did not believe {{he was capable of}} assassinating Obama. On December 16, 2008, Johnson pleaded guilty to one count of possession of a weapon by a prohibited person. Johnson was released from the Englewood Federal Correctional Institution on March 4, 2010.|$|E

5|$|On September 11, 2009, Hardy {{was arrested}} on charges of {{trafficking}} in controlled prescription pills <b>and</b> <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> anabolic steroids, after a search of his house yielded 262 Vicodin prescription pills, 180 Soma prescription pills, 555 milliliters of anabolic steroids, a residual amount of powder cocaine, and drug paraphernalia. Over a year later, the district attorney announced that Hardy would plead guilty to the charges. On September 8, 2011, Hardy was sentenced to ten days in jail, 30 months of probation, and a fine of $100,000. Hardy served his jail sentence from October 3 to 13, 2011.|$|E

5|$|The Crusades in the Holy Land are {{traditionally}} counted as nine distinct campaigns, numbered from the First Crusade of 1095–99 to the Ninth Crusade of 1271–72. This convention {{is used by}} Charles Mills in his History of the Crusades for the Recovery <b>and</b> <b>Possession</b> <b>of</b> the Holy Land (1820), and is often retained for convenience {{even though it is}} somewhat arbitrary. The Fifth and Sixth Crusades led by FrederickII may be considered a single campaign, as can the Eighth Crusade and Ninth Crusade led by LouisIX.|$|E
5|$|The {{legal status}} of {{psilocybin}} mushrooms varies worldwide. Psilocybin and psilocin are listed as Class A (United Kingdom) or Schedule I (US) drugs under the United Nations 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The possession and use of psilocybin mushrooms, including P.semilanceata, is therefore prohibited by extension. Although many European countries remained open to the use <b>and</b> <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> hallucinogenic mushrooms after the US ban, starting in the 2000s (decade) {{there has been a}} tightening of laws and enforcements. In The Netherlands, where the drug was once routinely sold in licensed cannabis coffee shops and smart shops, laws were instituted in October 2008 to prohibit the possession or sale of psychedelic mushrooms—the final European country to do so.|$|E
5|$|Duane Roger Morrison (July 23, 1953 – September 27, 2006) was {{eventually}} {{identified as the}} perpetrator of the incident. He was unemployed {{at the time of}} the hostage crisis, and had no known connection to Platte Canyon High School or any of the hostages. Initial reports of the gunman described him as a bearded 35-year-old man with a camouflage backpack and a black hooded sweatshirt. Morrison had been imprisoned in 1973 for larceny <b>and</b> <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> marijuana, and was arrested on a separate occasion for obstructing police in Littleton, Colorado. Police announced that a suicide letter written by Morrison to a family member was being analyzed by the FBI. Morrison's family gave the letter to police, who then submitted the document to the FBI Behavioral Unit in Quantico, Virginia. In the 14-page letter, Morrison claimed that he was mentally and physically abused by his father as a child, and had suicidal thoughts since he was 21 years old.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool {{were among}} the favourites to win the {{competition}} while Ajax were virtually unknown outside of the Netherlands. Liverpool manager Bill Shankly had made a scouting trip to watch Ajax before the match and witnessing them lose to lowly opposition returned confident Liverpool would progress. A few of Liverpool's players, including striker Roger Hunt, were part of England's victorious World Cup campaign in 1966. Ajax {{were coming out of}} a poor period, after they had finished in 13th place in the 1964–65 Eredivisie, while the Netherlands national team had yet to make an impression on the international stage. The board of Ajax decided to hire Rinus Michels. He changed the team's formation to a 4–2–4, with an emphasis on passing <b>and</b> <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> the ball. The team showed improvement, winning the Eredivisie in his first season in charge.|$|E
5|$|Shakur {{and four}} others (including Fred Hilton, Avon White, and Andrew Jackson) were indicted in the State Supreme Court in Bronx on December 31, 1973, {{on charges of}} {{attempting}} to shoot and kill two policemen—Michael O'Reilly and Roy Polliana, who were wounded but had since returned to duty—in an ambush in St. Albans, Queens on January 28, 1973. On March 5, 1974, two new defendants (Jeannette Jefferson and Robert Hayes) were named in an indictment involving the same charges. On April 26, while Shakur was pregnant, New Jersey Governor Brendan Byrne signed an extradition order to move Shakur to New York to face two counts of attempted murder, attempted assault, <b>and</b> <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> dangerous weapons related to the alleged ambush; however, Shakur declined to waive her right to an extradition hearing, {{and asked for a}} full hearing before Middlesex County Court Judge John E. Bachman.|$|E
5|$|By 1269, Roger Clifford {{had married}} Isabel Vieuxpont <b>and</b> <b>{{possession}}</b> <b>of</b> Brougham Castle– {{as well as}} her other property– descended through the Clifford family. In 1283, Roger predeceased his wife, who died in 1292. At 18, their son Robert was not old enough to take possession of his lands. During his three-year minority, his estates suffered from neglect and poaching. When the Wars of Scottish Independence began in 1296, Robert Clifford played a prominent role in the conflict. As the furthest north of his castles, Brougham became Clifford's most important base, and {{he spent a lot of}} time there. It was during this period that Clifford undertook an extensive building programme. The timber palisade surrounding the site was replaced with a stone curtain wall. A four-storey stone residential tower, called the Tower of League, was built in the castle's south-west corner. A fourth storey was added to the keep, and a double gatehouse attached to its northern side. The construction of a new stone hall to the south of the keep may indicate that during the war there was a larger garrison present than in peacetime, or it may have been built in anticipation of a royal visit. In July 1300, EdwardI– himself a renowned castle builder– visited Brougham with a large household of followers and the Prince of Wales. Although it is not certain whether the king stayed at the castle, historians believe it to have been likely. In 1309, Robert Clifford was granted a licence to crenellate Brougham Castle; this has been taken as an indication that by this point the rebuilding was complete. Licences to crenellate granted permission for a person to fortify a site. They were also proof of a relationship with or favour from the monarch, who was the one responsible for granting permission.|$|E
