5000|$|RAF: Any <b>air-dropped</b> <b>munitions</b> (with the {{exception}} of World War II German weapons) and aircraft crash sites.|$|E
50|$|From the 1970s to the 1990s cluster bombs became {{standard}} <b>air-dropped</b> <b>munitions</b> {{for many}} nations, {{in a wide}} variety of types. They have been produced by 34 countries and used in at least 23.|$|E
5000|$|Third, {{there is}} a manual [...] "man-in-the-loop" [...] {{guidance}} option, in which the WSO looks at a backseat TV display {{in order to see}} the seeker's view (sent to him through a RF command guidance datalink) and uses the backseat stick to control the bomb {{all the way to the}} target. With a skilled WSO that has a [...] "sensitive hand", this guidance method is probably the most accurate one employed today for <b>air-dropped</b> <b>munitions,</b> and has no measurable miss distance. Its main drawback is that it allows for only one bomb to be guided at a time.|$|E
2500|$|The MC-1 {{bomb was}} the first U.S. non-clustered <b>air-dropped</b> {{chemical}} <b>munition.</b> The [...] MC-1 was first produced in 1959 and carried the nerve agent sarin.|$|R
50|$|The RMA {{used both}} artillery-fired and <b>air-dropped</b> cluster <b>munitions.</b> BLU-63, M42 and MK118 submunitions were used at {{multiple}} locations in Bir Lahlou, Tifarity, Mehaires, Mijek and Awganit.|$|R
5000|$|Laser-designation - Using AN/PEQ-1 SOFLAM GLTD II, {{the units}} 'paint' hostile targets, marking them for attack by <b>air-dropped</b> laser-guided <b>munitions</b> {{such as the}} Paveway II LGB (laser-guided bomb) ...|$|R
50|$|In July 1956 VX-5 {{moved to}} the Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, California, as an {{independent}} tenant command because {{of the availability of}} vastly improved ranges and instrumentation facilities. In January 1985, the VX-5 Detachment at Whidbey Island, which oversaw developments relating to the EA-6B weapon system, was relocated to China Lake. Since then, temporary detachments have been made nationwide from Alaska to Florida, as required to test airborne weapons in a variety of conditions. The squadron has, due to changes and improvements in Navy weapon system, evolved over the years to include independent operation test and evaluation of all <b>air-dropped</b> <b>munitions</b> destined for operational use of the US Navy and US Marine Corps as well as development of tactics to be used with the new weapon system, and incorporation of electronic warfare advances into the self-defense capability of attack aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|Anti-handling {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} used in fuzes since at least 1940, in, for example, Luftwaffe's ZUS-40 anti-removal fuze [...] which was used during the London Blitz and elsewhere. ZUS-40s were designed to fit underneath most Luftwaffe bomb fuzes. When a delayed-action bomb containing a ZUS-40 was dropped on a target, the impact when it hit the ground freed a ball-bearing inside the ZUS-40, thereby arming a spring-loaded firing pin. However, so long as the main bomb fuze remained inside its fuze well, the cocked firing pin in the ZUS-40 was prevented from springing forward. ZUS-40s were often fitted underneath a type 17 clockwork long delay fuze, which gave between 2 and 72 hours delayed detonation. Rendering safe a type 17 fuze was normally a simple and straightforward process i.e. unscrew the fuze locking ring, remove the fuze from its pocket {{in the side of the}} bomb and unscrew the gaine. However, fitting a ZUS-40 underneath a type 17 fuze made the render-safe process much more complicated and dangerous. Removing the main time-delay fuze more than 15 millimetres from its fuze pocket (without neutralising the anti-handling device underneath) automatically released the cocked firing pin inside the ZUS-40, which sprang forward to strike a large percussion cap, thereby causing detonation of the bomb and the death of anyone nearby. Because the ZUS-40 was designed to be concealed underneath a conventional bomb fuze, it was very difficult to know whether a particular bomb was fitted with an anti-handling device or not. In any case, many electrically fired German bomb fuzes already had a pendulum-based [...] "trembler" [...] switch which triggered detonation if the bomb was subjected to rough handling. Some German anti-handling fuzes were even more dangerous to EOD personnel, such as the type 50 and 50BY fuzes. These were normally fitted to 250/500 kg bombs and contained two mercury tilt switches which detected vertical or horizontal movement. The fuzes fully armed themselves approximately 30 seconds after hitting the ground. Subsequently, if the bomb was moved in any way, the mercury switch triggered detonation. To complicate matters still further, German bombs could have two separate fuze pockets fitted, with different fuze types screwed into each one. As a result, one bomb could incorporate two separate anti-handling devices working independently of each other e.g. a type 17 clockwork fuze with a ZUS-40 hidden underneath it screwed into one fuze pocket, and a type 50BY in the other. Even comparatively small <b>air-dropped</b> <b>munitions</b> could incorporate an anti-handling feature e.g. the type 70 fuze fitted to Butterfly bombs. However, fuzes with an integral anti-handling feature were not only found in air-dropped bombs. For example, the T.Mi.Z.43 fuze (dating from 1943) fitted to Teller mines automatically triggered detonation if (in an attempt to render the mine safe) the pressure plate was unscrewed. Although the designs of these anti-handling fuzes varied, all were specifically designed to kill bomb disposal personnel who had the task of rendering them safe.|$|E
50|$|The E14 munition was a {{cardboard}} sub-munition (<b>air-dropped</b> or ground-launched <b>munitions</b> that eject smaller submunitions) {{developed by the}} United States biological weapons program as an anti-crop weapon. In a series of field tests in 1955, the E14 was loaded with fleas and air-dropped.|$|R
40|$|Cluster <b>munitions</b> are <b>air-dropped</b> or ground-launched <b>munitions</b> that {{release a}} number of smaller submunitions {{intended}} to kill enemy personnel or destroy vehicles. Cluster munitions were developed in World War II and are part of many nations' weapons stockpiles. Cluster munitions have been used frequently in combat, including the early phases of the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Cluster munitions have been highly criticized internationally for causing {{a significant number of}} civilian deaths, and efforts have been undertaken to ban and regulate their use...|$|R
50|$|During World War II, {{the airport}} {{was known as}} Nanning Airfield and {{was used by the}} United States Army Air Forces Fourteenth Air Force as part of the China Defensive Campaign (1942-1945). It was used {{primarily}} by reconnaissance units, which operated unarmed P-38 Lightning photo-recon aircraft that flew over Japanese-held territory and obtained intelligence used by combat units. Detachments of fighter and bomber squadrons also operated occasionally from the airfield, along with being a supply point for the 2d Combat Cargo Squadron, which <b>air-dropped</b> supplies and <b>munitions</b> to ground forces on the front lines. At the end of the war, the transports also hauled men, horses and mules to the airfield. The Americans closed their facilities at the end of October 1945.|$|R
5000|$|BAMS {{would operate}} from land bases, {{but it could}} be {{controlled}} by airborne and maritime platforms as well. Navy officials say they have not selected the Global Hawk for the application, but have also indicated they basically want to modify an off-the-shelf UAV instead of building one from scratch, and so the Global Hawk is a high-profile candidate. However, General Atomics and Lockheed Martin are aggressively pursuing the BAMS requirement as well, offering a [...] "Predator B-ER (Extended Range)" [...] known as the [...] "Mariner" [...] with more power, payload, and endurance, and with the capability to carry an AESA radar up to 16 <b>air-dropped</b> sensors or <b>munitions.</b> The BAMS requirement remains completely up in the air for the moment.|$|R
