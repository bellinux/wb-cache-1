Appleby, with his thick rubber-soled shoes, was not inconvenienced by the tacks, while Acoose, {{who had been in}} the lead, used moccasins that they easily penetrated; he was forced to quit. Gamblers backing Appleby were suspected, and all bets on the race were eventually declared void.|$|R
5000|$|Harzand {{returned}} on 10 September for the Irish Champion Stakes {{in which}} he was dropped in distance to ten furlongs and was matched against older horses. He started 2/1 favourite but <b>after</b> <b>tacking</b> the leaders he began to struggle three furlongs out and finished eighth behind the French colt Almanzor. A veterinary examination revealed that he had been [...] "struck into" [...] during the races, sustaining a minor injury to one of his hind legs. The colt recovered sufficiently to contest the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Chantilly Racecourse on 2 October and started third favourite behind Postponed and Makahiki. Ridden as usual by Smullen he never looked likely to win and finished ninth of the sixteen runners behind Found.|$|R
2500|$|Race 2 narrative: Alinghi {{received}} a penalty {{for being in}} the pre-start area before the designated time. There was very little pre-start maneuvering. BMW Oracle Racing started on starboard tack ahead of Alinghi on port tack. Alinghi sailed faster than during the previous race and benefited from a 20-degree wind shift, which put the Swiss boat in the lead at about {{the midpoint of the}} first leg. But after crossing ahead, Alinghi fell behind <b>after</b> <b>tacking</b> for the lay line. BMW Oracle Racing then proved to be much faster on the first reach, pulling about 2 kilometers ahead (26.8 kt vs. 25.2 kt average speed). [...] The final delta includes the penalty turn by Alinghi. Without the penalty turn the delta would have been around 4 minutes. Winds were 7 to 8 knots. Partial timings for the winner were 0h59 to upwind mark, 0h29 to gybe mark, 0h39 to finish.|$|R
60|$|The Pretty Poll was now jammed up on a wind, in {{the hope}} of closing with the chase {{in the course of the}} night. But the wind had been growing lighter and lighter for some hours, and by noon, though we had neared the chase so much as to be able to see her from deck, there was every {{prospect}} of its falling calm; after which, in the trades, it would be surprising if we did not get a blow. To make the most of our time, Marble determined to tack, when we had just got the chase a point off our weather-bow. An hour <b>after</b> <b>tacking,</b> an object was seen adrift on the ocean, and keeping away a little to close with it, it was ascertained to be a whale-boat, adrift. The boat was American built, had a breaker of water, the oars, and all the usual fittings in it; and the painter being loose, it had probably been lost, when towing in the night, in consequence of having been fastened by three half-hitches.|$|R
60|$|As {{the tide}} flowed, it was {{expected}} that the Smeaton would have got to windward; but, seeing that all was safe, <b>after</b> <b>tacking</b> for several hours and making little progress, she bore away for Arbroath, with the praam-boat. As there was now too much wind for the pilot-boat to return to Arbroath, she was made fast astern of the floating light, and the crew remained on board till next day, when the weather moderated. There can be very little doubt that the appearance of James Spink with his boat on this critical occasion was the means of preventing the loss of lives at the rock this morning. When these circumstances, some years afterwards, came to the knowledge of the Board, a small pension was ordered to our faithful pilot, then in his seventieth year; and he still continues to wear the uniform clothes and badge of the Lighthouse service. Spink is a remarkably strong man, whose tout ensemble is highly characteristic of a North-country fisherman. He usually dresses in a pé-jacket, cut after a particular fashion, and wears a large, flat, blue bonnet. A striking likeness of Spink in his pilot-dress, with the badge or insignia on his left arm which is characteristic of the boatmen {{in the service of the}} Northern Lights, has been taken by Howe, and is in the writer's possession.|$|R

I think the nearest of the rascals got it this time, for away she went, after her consort, both running off towards the islands. We made a little show of chasing, {{but it was only}} a feint; for we were too glad to get away from them, to be in earnest. In ten minutes <b>after</b> we <b>tacked</b> the last time, we ceased firing, having thrown some eight or ten round-shot after the proas, and were close-hauled again, heading to the south-west.|$|R

He was opposed again by Ajdal and the two English-trained colts were made the 6/4 joint-favourites {{in a field of}} nine runners. As at Newmarket, Don't Forget Me established an early lead and responded well when challenged in the final furlong, winning by a half a length and a neck from Entitled and Ajdal. His victory was enthusiastically received, with hundreds of fans thronging the winner's enclosure and chanting the name of the winning jockey. Although the Derby was briefly considered as ha target, Hannon opted to keep the colt to the one-mile distance and his next race was the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot. He was ridden by Eddery after Carson received a seven-day ban for striking another jockey with his whip in a minor race at Bath Racecourse. He started the 10/11 favourite but finished fourth behind Half A Year, Soviet Star and Risk Me.|$|R

60|$|For a {{few minutes}} we fared pretty well; but we were no sooner well entered between the lines, than we got it, hot and hard. Our rigging began to come down about our ears, and one shot passed a few feet above our heads, cutting both topsail-sheets, and {{scooping}} a bit of wood {{as big as a}} thirty-two pound shot, out of the foremast. I went up on one side, myself, to knot one of these sheets, and, while aloft, discovered the injury that had been done to the spar. Soon <b>after,</b> the <b>tack</b> of the mainsail caught fire, from a wad of one of the Englishmen; for, by this time, we were close at it. I think, indeed, that the nearness of the enemy alone prevented our decks from being entirely swept. The grape and canister were passing just above our heads like hail, and the foresail was literally in ribands. The halyards being gone, the mainsail came down by the run, and the jib settled as low as it could. The topsail-yard was on the cap, and the schooner now came up into the wind.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{the thesis}} was to explore the {{clinical}} and radiographic results after post- traumatic anterior shoulder instability treated with arthroscopic Bankart surgery using absorbable tacks with different compositions. Further aims were to explore possible effects on bone mineral in the heel bone and health-related quality of life after a shoulder-stabilising surgical procedure. Study I was a clinical long-term study of 81 patients (84 shoulders) operated on using tacks made of PGA (polygluconate B polymer). The majority of patients had good functional results after eight years, although 18 % had recurrent instability. Study II was a randomised, controlled study (RCT) using two different tacks, PGA and PLLA (poly-L-lactate acid polymer), with a clinical and radiographic evaluation after seven years. The drill holes <b>after</b> implanting PLLA <b>tacks</b> (18 patients) had healed {{to a lesser extent}} (55 % unhealed) than those <b>after</b> implanting PGA <b>tacks</b> (17 patients), (0 % unhealed), seven years after the operation. There were no differences between the groups regarding radiographic degenerative findings or functional results. Study III (32 patients, 34 shoulders) was a clinical and radiographic two- and eight-year follow-up after reconstruction using PGA implants. As in Study II, the radiographs were classified with regard to the drill-hole appearance and degenerative changes. In Study III, the radiological degenerative changes increased from no changes preoperatively to 24 % mild and 18 % moderate degenerative changes eight years postoperatively. In Study IV (23 patients), bone mineral was evaluated using Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) combined with laser measurement in the heel bone preoperatively and until five years postoperatively. Activity level was classified according to Tegner activity level and health-related quality of life was classified with the Euroqol 5 -dimension (EQ- 5 D) instrument. The bone mineral had decreased by 6 % in the calcaneus five years after the operation. The activity level did not increase, but the EQ- 5 D increased after the operation...|$|R
60|$|We {{ought to}} have taken warning from the general {{skepticism}} we met with at Toyama, when we proposed the pass. But with the fatal faith {{of a man in}} his guidebook, we ignored the native forebodings. Besides, there were just people enough who knew nothing about it, and therefore thought it could be done, to encourage us in our delusion. Accordingly we left Toyama after lunch in the best of spirits, in jinrikisha, for Kamidaki, or Upper Fall, to which there professed to be a jinrikisha road. The distance was three ri, seven miles and a half. Before we had gone one of them the road gave out, and left us to tack on foot in paths through the rice-fields, which in one long inclination kept mounting before us. Just before reaching the village, a huge tree in full faint purple bloom showed up a little to the left. Under a sudden attack of botanical zeal, I struck across lots to investigate, and <b>after</b> much <b>tacking</b> among the paddy dykes found, to my surprise, on reaching it, that the flowers came from a huge wistaria that had coiled itself up the tree. The vine must have been at least six feet round at the base, and had a body horribly like an enormous boa that swung from branches high in air. The animal look of the vegetable parasite was so lifelike that one both longed and loathed to touch it at the same time.|$|R

50|$|In {{the second}} ever matchup {{between the two}} schools, the Eagles and Huskies {{struggled}} through a close defensive battle, which is quickly becoming a trend for the season as the BC defense continues to lead the FBS in total yards allowed. After trading punts throughout the 1st quarter, the Eagles broke through with the first score of the game, when Troy Flutie, who started in lieu of Darius Wade after suffering a broken ankle in the previous week against FSU, threw a 27-yard touchdown to Charlie Callinan. The Huskies would answer back with a rushing score shortly {{before the end of}} the half, set up by a long interception return to the 4 yard line. The Eagles would take the lead again with a 21-yard rushing score by Jonathan Hilliman in the 3rd. It seemed all but over <b>after</b> BC <b>tacked</b> on a field goal late in the 4th to make it a 17-7 game, however, the Huskies would make it interesting, returning the ensuing kickoff for a touchdown to come within 3 points.

Hilliman lead the way for the Eagles, rushing for 119 yards and a score on the day. Flutie went 5 for 11, throwing 92 yards and a score, and Jeff Smith, who also took snaps with Wade out, ran for 56 yards on 9 attempts.

5|$|Since SMU had {{received}} the ball to start the game, Fresno State got possession to start the second half. The first play from scrimmage of the half was a 38-yard pass from Carr to Burse which got the Bulldogs up to the Mustangs' 41-yard line. The drive stalled from there, however, after a six-yard loss on a pass play, a false start penalty, a pass completed for no gain, and an incomplete pass. After a 42-yard punt that was returned for 4 yards, SMU was set up at their 14-yard line. The ensuing drive for SMU showed promise after they got into Bulldog territory, but an interception by Sean Alston returned for 50 yards to the SMU 15 ended any chance of scoring for the Mustangs. Fresno State finally put points on the board after setting up in the red zone; Carr threw a 6-yard pass to Adams making the score 22-7 <b>after</b> Quentin Breshears <b>tacked</b> on the point after.

60|$|That {{the ship}} {{destroyed}} was Dirk Hatteraick's no one doubted. His lugger {{was well known}} on the coast, and had been expected just at this time. A letter from {{the commander of the}} king's sloop, to whom the Sheriff made application, put the matter beyond doubt; he sent also an extract from his log-book of the transactions of the day, which intimated their being on the outlook for a smuggling lugger, Dirk Hatteraick master, upon the information and requisition of Francis Kennedy, of his Majesty's excise service; and that Kennedy was to be upon the outlook on the shore, in case Hatteraick, who was known to be a desperate fellow, and had been repeatedly outlawed, should attempt to run his sloop aground. About nine o'clock A.M. they discovered a sail which answered the description of Hatteraick's vessel, chased her, and, after repeated signals to her to show colours and bring-to, fired upon her. The chase then showed Hamburgh colours and returned the fire; and a running fight was maintained for three hours, when, just as the lugger was doubling the Point of Warroch, they observed that the main-yard was shot in the slings, and that the vessel was disabled. It was not {{in the power of the}} man-of-war's men for some time to profit by this circumstance, owing to their having kept too much in shore for doubling the headland. <b>After</b> two <b>tacks,</b> they accomplished this, and observed the chase on fire and apparently deserted. The fire having reached some casks of spirits, which were placed on the deck, with other combustibles, probably on purpose, burnt with such fury that no boats durst approach the vessel, especially as her shotted guns were discharging one after another by the heat. The captain had no doubt whatever that the crew had set the vessel on fire and escaped in their boats. After watching the conflagration till the ship blew up, his Majesty's sloop, the Shark, stood towards the Isle of Man, with the purpose of intercepting the retreat of the smugglers, who, though they might conceal themselves in the woods for a day or two, would probably take the first opportunity of endeavouring to make for this asylum.

With wonder and admiration, Alleyne, leaning over the bulwarks, gazed at the forest of masts, the swarm of boats darting hither and thither on the bosom of the broad curving stream, and the gray {{crescent-shaped}} city which stretched with many a tower and minaret along the western shore. Never had he in his quiet life seen so great a town, nor was there in the whole of England, save London alone, one which might match it in size or in wealth. Here came the merchandise of all the fair countries which are watered by the Garonne and the Dordogne--the cloths of the south, the skins of Guienne, the wines of the Medoc--to be borne away to Hull, Exeter, Dartmouth, Bristol or Chester, in exchange for the wools and woolfels of England. Here too dwelt those famous smelters and welders who had made the Bordeaux steel the most trusty upon earth, and could give a temper to lance or to sword which might mean dear life to its owner. Alleyne could see the smoke of their forges reeking up in the clear morning air. The storm had died down now to a gentle breeze, which wafted to his ears the long-drawn stirring bugle-calls which sounded from the ancient ramparts.|$|R
40|$|In the Grand Tack (GT) {{scenario}} {{for the young}} solar system, Jupiter formed beyond 3. 5 AU from the Sun and migrated as close as 1. 5 AU until it encountered an orbital resonance with Saturn. Both planets then supposedly migrated outward for several $ 10 ^ 5 $ yr, with Jupiter ending up at ~ 5 AU. The initial conditions of the GT and the timing between Jupiter's migration {{and the formation of}} the Galilean satellites remain unexplored. We study the formation of Ganymede and Callisto, both of which consist of ~ 50 % H$_ 2 $O and rock, in the GT scenario. We examine why they lack dense atmospheres, while Titan is surrounded by a thick N$_ 2 $ envelope. We model an axially symmetric circumplanetary disk (CPD) in hydrostatic equilibrium around Jupiter. The CPD is warmed by viscous heating, Jupiter's luminosity, accretional heating, and the Sun. The position of the H$_ 2 $O ice line in the CPD, which is crucial for the formation of massive moons, is computed at various solar distances. We assess the loss of Galilean atmospheres due to high-energy radiation from the young Sun. Ganymede and Callisto cannot have accreted their H$_ 2 $O during Jupiter's supposed GT, because its CPD (if still active) was too warm to host ices and much smaller than Ganymede's contemporary orbit. From a thermal perspective, the Galilean moons might have had significant atmospheres, but these would probably have been eroded during the GT in < $ 10 ^ 5 $ yr by solar XUV radiation. Jupiter and the Galilean moons formed beyond 4. 5 (+/- 0. 5) AU and prior to the proposed GT. Thereafter, Jupiter's CPD would have been dry, and delayed accretion of planetesimals should have created water-rich Io and Europa. While Galilean atmospheres would have been lost during the GT, Titan would have formed <b>after</b> Saturn's own <b>tack,</b> because Saturn still accreted substantially for ~$ 10 ^ 6 $ yr after its closest solar approach, ending up at about 7 AU.

5000|$|On 9 February 1799, {{after being}} at sea for three days, the [...] spotted Insurgente {{approximately}} six leagues northeast off Nevis. Insurgente, a fully rigged frigate, was {{considered one of}} the fastest sailing vessels in the world at the time; three weeks earlier she had encountered Constellation but was able to outrun her and escape. Shortly after being spotted by Constellation this second time the ships encountered a squall during which a violent gust of wind snapped Insurgentes topmast, impairing her speed. As Constellation approached, Captain Michael-Pierre Barreaut first attempted to seek haven by making for St. Eustatius, but to no avail, where Insurgente hauled wind and assumed a starboard <b>tack.</b> <b>After</b> being overtaken she hoisted American colors, at which time the Constellation hoisted the private signals. Unable to respond appropriately, she gave up her attempt at disguise and Captain Barreaut ordered the French tri-colors hoisted and a gun fired to windward to signal the challenge where Insurgente boldly sat in wait to be engaged. This was {{the first time since the}} American Revolution that a shot had been fired from an enemy vessel at an American ship. Truxtun gave the order to clear the deck of Constellation for action and the boatswain sounded the whistle. Both ships bore up to take positions to engage. The Constellation fired the first broadside, double-shotted, inflicting much damage to the French vessel's hull and killing many in the first minute of the engagement. Insurgente responded and fired a broadside, inflicting much damage to Constellation's rigging and top foremast, which was almost cut off. At 3:30 PM after an hour and a half of running battle and several raking broadsides from the Constellation the Insurgente struck her colors. First Lieutenant John Rodgers, Midshipman David Porter along with eleven men were put on board the captured vessel to take possession and to secure the prisoners who were sent to the lower hold. She had lost 70 men from a crew of 409, while Constellation, badly damaged also, only lost three out of a complement of 309. This was the first post-Revolutionary War American victory against a foreign naval vessel.|$|R
