5|$|A {{major theme}} {{of the game is}} heroism, where being a hero may bring more harm than help. During development, there was a point at the {{beginning}} of the game where players could choose to leave Dubai. This was cut from the game, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> found it not effective enough, and it broke a player's immersion in the game. According to Williams, the choice system was originally designed to be similar to Fable II, where after a player makes a decision, they cannot reload the game and choose differently unless they start a new game. This was later removed due to the game's structure as a shooter, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> feared that it might make the game unwinnable and cause players to feel frustrated. Williams later added that adding achievements to the game was a mistake, as it disrupts the game's narrative.|$|E
5|$|According to Williams, {{the game}} was {{difficult}} to market, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> wanted to prevent spoiling the narrative yet encourage people to buy the game. He added that the demo they released was unrepresentative of the final game. Williams expected the game to be sold through word of mouth promotion {{and that it would}} eventually become a cult classic.|$|E

5|$|After qualifying, {{the race}} {{stewards}} {{decided not to}} give a penalty to Magnussen for crossing the pit light, since it had only changed to red 0.55 seconds before he crossed the pit exit line. Kvyat escaped penalty as well after his car failed the obligatory front floor deflection test. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> pointed out, the irregularity {{was the result of}} an impact on track, allowing him to keep eighth on the grid.|$|E
5|$|After {{undertaking}} {{a series}} of friendlies, Arsenal played Tottenham Hotspur in the Charity Shield and drew 0–0 to share the honour. Defeats by Everton and Aston Villa {{set the tone for}} the league season <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> were left with much to do; a poor run of form during the Christmas and New Year period effectively ruled the team out of retaining the championship. Arsenal finished the season strongly however – unbeaten in 16 matches, to end the campaign in fourth place. Wright was Arsenal's top goalscorer with 26 goals.|$|E
5|$|Alonso {{was named}} in the Spanish squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup and he scored Spain's first goal of the tournament, his first {{international}} goal, against Ukraine on 14 June 2006.

50|$|In {{the early}} years, the toyline mostly held off on {{identifying}} the one character that served <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>team's</b> leader. <b>The</b> first {{run of the}} toyline featured Hawk <b>as</b> <b>the</b> highest-ranking <b>team</b> member; however though his file card makes specific mention of his abilities as a leader, it falls short of explicitly naming him <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>team’s</b> commander. Duke, who appeared the following year, is not specifically mentioned <b>as</b> either <b>the</b> <b>team's</b> commander or second-in-command, but his file card extols his ability to command by winning respect and mentions his current assignment as acting First Sergeant of <b>the</b> <b>team.</b> Any question of <b>the</b> <b>team's</b> commanding officer ended in 1986 when Hawk's second action figure version was released, and the character was officially billeted <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>team's</b> overall leader rather than field commander.|$|R

The following season, however, Mondini was restored <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>team's</b> first choice keeper. In the 2004-05 season, Gabriele Paoletti succeed Mondini as Reggiana's first choice keeper, and Nuzzo played one match for <b>the</b> <b>team</b> throughout <b>the</b> season, which ultimately ended in relegation to Serie C2 in 2005.|$|R

5|$|Another injury problem; {{this time}} an ankle {{ligament}} injury sustained in a pre-season match at Goodison Park, restricted Shearer to just twogoals in 17games in the 1997–98 season. His injury {{was reflected in}} the club's form, and Newcastle finished just 13th in the Premier League. However, United (now managed by Shearer's old boss at Blackburn, Kenny Dalglish) had a good run in the FA Cup; Shearer scored the winning goal in a semi-final victory over Sheffield United <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> reached the final. The team were unable to get on the scoresheet at Wembley, and lost the game 2–0 to Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> {{advanced}} to the front, they were brought under heavy enemy rifle, grenade and mortar fire. Just as the three had reached the front lines, a Japanese grenade landed among them. It {{was less than a}} foot from the two Marines with PFC Gonsalves. Without a moment's hesitation, he flung himself on the grenade, taking the full explosion into his own body. He gallantly gave his life for his fellow Marines and his country. The other two were not even touched by grenade fragments and they successfully completed their mission.|$|E
50|$|On September 26, 1973, the Conquistadors signed Wilt Chamberlain to a three-year, $1.8 million {{contract}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>team's</b> player-coach. <b>The</b> Los Angeles Lakers promptly {{went to court}} and won a ruling that Chamberlain could only play professional basketball for the Lakers, but the court did allow Chamberlain to coach the Conquistadors. Stan Albeck was hired <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Conquistadors' assistant coach and <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>team's</b> Director of Player Personnel.

50|$|The Cleveland Browns' {{offense was}} marred by bad play-calling {{throughout}} {{the early stages of}} the 2006 season, forcing the resignation of <b>the</b> <b>team's</b> offensive coordinator, Maurice Carthon, on October 24, 2006. Following Carthon's resignation, head coach Romeo Crennel hired assistant head coach and offensive line coach Jeff Davidson <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>team's</b> offensive coordinator for the remainder of the 2006 season. However, the Browns lost Davidson to the Carolina Panthers, where he was hired to serve <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Panthers' offensive coordinator. Because of Davidson's hiring in Carolina, the Browns hired Rob Chudzinski <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>team's</b> new offensive coordinator. <b>The</b> <b>team</b> has also hired Ted Daisher <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>team's</b> new special teams coordinator.|$|R
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> {{with the}} best regular season record, the Presidents' Trophy winner is {{guaranteed}} home-ice advantage in all four rounds of the Stanley Cup playoffs, provided they advance that far. However, it does not guarantee that success; only eight of these winners {{have gone on to}} win the Stanley Cup. Three other teams reached the Stanley Cup Finals, but failed to win. The last team to win both the Presidents' Trophy and the Stanley Cup in the same season was the 2012–13 Chicago Blackhawks. The only team to accomplish this more than once is the Detroit Red Wings.|$|E
5|$|At first distraught at leaving Montreal, Dutton quickly {{adapted to}} playing in New York. He {{maintained}} his aggressive {{style of play}} with the Americans, again leading the league in penalties in 1931–32. Despite his fiery temper, Dutton {{became one of the}} most popular players in New York amongst both the fans and his fellow players. He was not able to turn the Americans' fortunes on the ice around, however, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> failed to qualify for the playoffs in his first five seasons with the team.|$|E
