5|$|<b>Anal</b> veins (A) – {{only two}} <b>anal</b> veins 1A and 2A are present, 2A is not {{distinctive}} in some species.|$|E
5|$|<b>Anal</b> veins (AA, AP) – veins {{behind the}} cubitus, {{separated}} by <b>anal</b> fold.|$|E
5|$|<b>Anal</b> veins (A) – veins {{behind the}} cubitus.|$|E
5|$|<b>Anal</b> veins (A1) – {{unbranched}} veins {{behind the}} cubitus.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the ventral {{scales of}} the snake is an <b>anal</b> plate that protects the opening to the cloaca (a shared opening for waste and {{reproductive}} material to pass) on the underside near the tail. This <b>anal</b> scale may be single or divided into a pair. The part of the body beyond the <b>anal</b> scale is considered to be the tail.|$|E
5|$|Branches also {{innervate}} {{muscles of}} the perineum and the pelvic floor; namely, the bulbospongiosus and the ischiocavernosus muscles respectively, the levator ani muscle (including the Iliococcygeus, pubococcygeus, puborectalis and either pubovaginalis in females or puboprostaticus in males) the external <b>anal</b> sphincter (via the inferior <b>anal</b> branch), and male or female external urethral sphincter.|$|E
5|$|<b>Anal</b> veins (A) – veins {{behind the}} cubitus, 1A and 2A fused in the forewing, CuP and 2A are folded.|$|E
5|$|<b>Anal</b> veins (A) – veins {{behind the}} cubitus, unbranched, two in forewing, many in hindwing 1A-7A in one {{group and the}} rest in another group.|$|E
5|$|<b>Anal</b> veins (A) – veins {{behind the}} cubitus, unbranched, two in forewing, many in hindwing.|$|E

5|$|Jennaration X's debut film, Cum-Spoiled Sluts, (featuring {{scenes with}} Haze, Johnny Sins, Nikki Rhodes and James Deen) was {{released}} March 23, 2009, followed by <b>Anal</b> Academics which was released July 6, 2009.|$|E
5|$|Species of Blattodea (cockroaches) have a forewing, {{are also}} known as tegmen, that {{is more or less}} sclerotized. It is used in flight as well as a form of {{protection}} of the membranous hindwings. The veins of hindwing are about the same as front wing but with large <b>anal</b> lobe folded at rest between CuP and 1A. The <b>anal</b> lobe usually folded in a fan-like manner.|$|E
5|$|The two dorsal fins {{are roughly}} equal {{in size and}} placed far back on the body: the first {{originates}} behind {{the midpoint of the}} pelvic fin bases and the second behind the midpoint of the <b>anal</b> fin base. The pectoral fins are large, while the pelvic fins are small and low, with angular margins. The <b>anal</b> fin is much larger than either dorsal fin; its base measures 13–18% of the total length and greatly exceeds the distance between the pelvic and <b>anal</b> fins, or between the dorsal fins. The caudal peduncle is laterally compressed, {{with the end of the}} <b>anal</b> fin very close to the caudal fin. The caudal fin comprises around a quarter of the total length; the upper lobe is low with a ventral notch near the tip, while the lower lobe is indistinct. The skin is very thick and covered by well-calcified dermal denticles. There is a prominent row of enlarged denticles, resembling saw teeth, along the upper edge of the caudal fin. The body is grayish-brown above, with 15–18 dark, rounded saddles, blotches, and/or spots that run onto the tail; each marking is highlighted by a paler border. The underside is white, as are the tips of the dorsal and caudal fins. The inside of the mouth is black.|$|E
5|$|Unilateral pudendal nerve {{neuropathy}} inconsistently causes {{fecal incontinence}} in some, but not others. This is because crossover innervation {{of the external}} <b>anal</b> sphincter occurs in some individuals.|$|E
5|$|A single large wing from {{a species}} of Diptera in the Triassic (10mm instead of usual 2–6mm) was found in Australia (Mt. Crosby).This family Tilliardipteridae, despite of the {{numerous}} 'tipuloid' features, {{should be included in}} Psychodomorpha sensu Hennig on account of loss of the convex distal 1A reaching wing margin and formation of the <b>anal</b> loop.|$|E
5|$|A typical fish is ectothermic, has a {{streamlined}} body for rapid swimming, extracts oxygen from water using gills or uses an accessory breathing organ to breathe atmospheric oxygen, has {{two sets of}} paired fins, usually one or two (rarely three) dorsal fins, an <b>anal</b> fin, and a tail fin, has jaws, has skin that is usually covered with scales, and lays eggs.|$|E
5|$|Circumcision {{may be used}} {{to treat}} {{pathological}} phimosis, refractory balanoposthitis and chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). The World Health Organization promotes circumcision to prevent female-to-male HIV transmission in countries with high rates of HIV. The International Antiviral Society-USA also suggests circumcision be discussed with MSM who engage in primarily insertive <b>anal</b> sex, especially in areas where HIV is common.|$|E
5|$|Communication among North American river otters is {{accomplished}} mainly by olfactory and auditory signals. Scent marking is imperative for intergroup communication. The river otter scent-marks with feces, urine, and possibly <b>anal</b> sac secretions. Musk from the scent glands {{may also be}} secreted when otters are frightened or angry.|$|E
5|$|Midbody {{there are}} 29–41 rows of dorsal scales. These are {{strongly}} keeled {{except for the}} outermost rows. The ventral scale count is 123–147, the subcaudals 14–38. Females have no more than 24 subcaudals. The <b>anal</b> scale is single.|$|E
5|$|Mole crickets evade predators {{by living}} below ground, and vigorously {{burrowing}} if disturbed at the surface. As a last-ditch defence, they eject a foul-smelling brown liquid from their <b>anal</b> glands when captured; {{they can also}} bite.|$|E
5|$|Most {{veins and}} crossveins {{occur in the}} {{anterior}} area of the remigium, {{which is responsible for}} most of the flight, powered by the thoracic muscles. The posterior portion of the remigium is sometimes called the clavus; the two other posterior fields are the <b>anal</b> and jugal ares. When the vannal fold has the usual position anterior to the group of <b>anal</b> veins, the remigium contains the costal, subcostal, radial, medial, cubital, and postcubital veins. In the flexed wing the remigiumturns posteriorly on the flexible basal connection of the radius with the second axillary, and the base of the mediocubital field is folded medially on the axillary region along the plica basalis (bf) between the median plates (m, m') of the wing base.|$|E
5|$|Stick insect have {{forewings}} {{that are}} tough, opaque tegmina, short and covering only the base {{part of the}} hindwings at rest. Hindwings from costa to Cubitus are tough and opaque like the forewings. The large <b>anal</b> area are membranous and folded in fan-like manner. There are no or very few branching in stick insect wing veins.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen has ten segments, {{each with}} a pair of spiracles for respiration. Segment ten bears a pair of cerci, a pair of <b>anal</b> styles, the anus and the {{external}} genitalia. Males have an aedeagus through which they secrete sperm during copulation and females have spermathecae for storing sperm and an ovipositor through which the ootheca is laid.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen or body is {{composed}} of nine segments. In the larva it ranges from segments 5 to 13. The eleventh segment of the larva holds a pair of <b>anal</b> claspers, which protude in some taxa and represent the genitalia.|$|E
5|$|The {{available}} evidence {{does not indicate}} that circumcision provides HIV protection for heterosexual women. Data is lacking regarding the effect circumcision may have on the transmission rate of men who engage in <b>anal</b> sex with a female partner. It is undetermined whether circumcision benefits {{men who have sex}} with men.|$|E
5|$|The body is stout, the {{cross-section}} {{of which is}} rounded to circular. The dorsal scales are strongly keeled; only the lowest row is smooth. Mid-body, the dorsal scales number 27–33. The ventral scales number 153–180. The <b>anal</b> plate is not divided. The tail is short — about 14% of the total length — with the paired subcaudals numbering 41–68.|$|E
5|$|The broad, {{triangular}} pectoral fins originate {{below the}} third or fourth gill slits, and are no longer than the front margin of the first dorsal fin. The <b>anal</b> fin is about twice as long as the second dorsal fin and preceded by long ridges. The first dorsal fin originates over the pectoral fin free rear tips, and the much smaller second dorsal fin originates over the last third of the <b>anal</b> fin base. The dorsal fins do not have a ridge between them. The lower lobe of the caudal fin is well-developed and the upper lobe has a ventral notch near the tip. This shark is plain gray, brown-gray, or purple-gray above, and white below. The leading edge of the first dorsal fin and the trailing edge of the caudal fin may be dark, and the trailing edges of the pectoral fins may be light.|$|E
5|$|The burbot, a {{predatory fish}} native to streams and lakes of North America and Eurasia, is also {{commonly}} mistaken for bowfin. Burbots {{can be distinguished}} by their flat head and chin barbel, long <b>anal</b> fin, and pelvic fins situated beneath the pectoral fins.|$|E
5|$|The fins are {{strongly}} falcate (sickle-shaped), particularly the dorsal fins, pelvic fins, and lower caudal fin lobe. The pectoral fins are narrow and pointed. The first dorsal fin is positioned about {{halfway between the}} pectoral and pelvic fins. The second dorsal fin is about two-thirds as tall as the first and is positioned slightly ahead of the <b>anal</b> fin. The <b>anal</b> fin is smaller than the second dorsal fin. The dorsal surface of the caudal peduncle bears a crescent-shaped notch at the caudal fin origin. The asymmetrical caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a long upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The dermal denticles are small and overlapping; each has five horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This species is light grey or bronze above, often with small white spots on the sides, and pale below. The dorsal fins are tipped in white, which is especially obvious on the second dorsal as the remainder of fin is mostly dark.|$|E
5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} {{is large and}} triangular, with a pointed apex and a concave {{trailing}} margin; it originates roughly over the posterior insertions of the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin {{is less than a}} third as high as the first, and originates ahead of the <b>anal</b> fin. There is no midline ridge between the dorsal fins. The long pectoral fins are broad and slightly falcate (sickle-shaped), becoming narrow and pointed at the tips. The <b>anal</b> fin has a sharply notched trailing margin. The caudal peduncle has a deep notch on its upper surface at the caudal fin origin. The caudal fin is asymmetrical, with a well-developed lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with a notch in the trailing margin near its tip.|$|E
5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} is {{relatively}} small and usually originates behind the free rear tip of the pectoral fins. No ridge exists {{between the first and}} second dorsal fins. The pectoral fins are moderately short, narrow, and falcate (sickle-shaped). The body is densely covered with diamond-shaped dermal denticles with seven (rarely five) shallow horizontal ridges. The coloration is gray above, sometimes with a bronze sheen, and white below, with a faint white band on the sides. Young individuals have unmarked fins; the tips of the second dorsal fin, pectoral fins, <b>anal</b> fin, and lower caudal fin lobe (and sometimes the other fins, as well) are black in larger individuals. The spinner shark differs from the blacktip shark in that its first dorsal fin is slightly more triangular in shape and is placed further back on the body. Adults can also be distinguished by the black tip on the <b>anal</b> fin.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fins are as long {{or longer}} than the head, with a nearly straight front margin and broad tips. The first dorsal fin is large with a rounded apex, and is placed behind the pectoral fins. The second dorsal and <b>anal</b> fins are tiny. The caudal peduncle is expanded laterally into strong keels. The caudal fin is crescent-shaped, with a small notch near {{the tip of the}} upper lobe. The dermal denticles are elliptical, longer than wide, with three to seven horizontal ridges leading to a toothed posterior margin. The coloration is dark blue to grayish black above and white below. The unpaired fins are dark except for a white rear margin on the <b>anal</b> fin; the pectoral and pelvic fins are dark above and white below with sharp gray posterior margins. In adults and large juveniles, the area beneath the snout, around the jaw, and the origin of the pectoral fins have dusky mottling.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{wildlife}} reservoirs for Trypanosoma cruzi in the United States include opossums, raccoons, armadillos, squirrels, woodrats, and mice. Opossums {{are particularly}} important as reservoirs, because the parasite can complete its life cycle in the <b>anal</b> glands of this animal without having to re-enter the insect vector. Recorded prevalence of the disease in opossums in the U.S. ranges from 8.3% to 37.5%.|$|E
5|$|The scenes Ubisoft removed depict <b>anal</b> probing by {{aliens and}} the player-character {{performing}} an abortion. In their place, the game displays a still {{image of a}} statue holding its face in its hand, with an explicit description of events depicted in the scene. In Australia, the same scenes were removed because the Australian Classification Board refused to rate the game for release due to the depiction of sexual violencespecifically the child player-character being subjected to <b>anal</b> probing and the interactive abortion scene. Like the European version, these scenes were replaced with a placeholder card with an explanation of what was removed on a background image of a koala crying.|$|E
5|$|When at rest, {{the wings}} are held {{over the back}} in most insects, which may involve {{longitudinal}} folding of the wing membrane and sometimes also transverse folding. Folding may sometimes occur along the flexion lines. Though fold lines may be transverse, as in the hindwings of beetles and earwigs, they are normally radial {{to the base of}} the wing, allowing adjacent sections of a wing to be folded over or under each other. The commonest fold line is the jugal fold, situated just behind the third <b>anal</b> vein, although, most Neoptera have a jugal fold just behind vein 3A on the forewings. It is sometimes also present on the hindwings. Where the <b>anal</b> area of the hindwing is large, as in Orthoptera and Blattodea, the whole of this part may be folded under the anterior part of the wing along a vannal fold a little posterior to the claval furrow. In addition, in Orthoptera and Blattodea, the <b>anal</b> area is folded like a fan along the veins, the <b>anal</b> veins being convex, at the crests of the folds, and the accessory veins concave. Whereas the claval furrow and jugal fold are probably homologous in different species, the vannal fold varies in position in different taxa. Folding is produced by a muscle arising on the pleuron and inserted into the third axillary sclerite in such a way that, when it contracts, the sclerite pivots about its points of articulation with the posterior notal process and the second axillary sclerite.|$|E
5|$|After mating, sheep have a {{gestation}} period of around five months. Within {{a few days}} of the impending birth, ewes begin to behave differently. They may lie down and stand erratically, paw the ground, or otherwise act out of sync with normal flock patterns. A ewe's udder will quickly fill out, and her vulva will swell. Vaginal, uterine or <b>anal</b> prolapse may also occur, in which case either stitching or a physical retainer can be used to hold the orifice in if the problem persists.|$|E
