In contrast to the conventional COQ analysis we take into account not only the internal quality costs within the company, but also the costs of its suppliers.

We consider a setting where a risk neutral supplier sells an intermediate product to a risk neutral buyer. The supplier incurs prevention costs to reduce the probability of selling a defective product, and the buyer incurs <b>appraisal</b> <b>costs</b> to identify defects. Both decisions are subject to moral hazard. We show that the first-best outcome can be obtained if either: (i) the supplier's prevention decision is contractible; or (ii) the buyer's appraisal decision and either internal failure (i. e., the product's failing the buyer's appraisal test) or external failure (i. e., the product's failing after being sold by the buyer) are contractible events; or (iii) both internal and external failure are contractible events. We then focus on the second-best setting where actions and failures are not contractible and study the effect of making the buyer's appraisal result contractible. Relative to first-best, if a buyer's return decision is contractible (but not his appraisal result), the supplier incurs lower prevention costs, the buyer incurs higher <b>appraisal</b> <b>costs,</b> expected internal failure costs are higher, and the total cost of quality is higher. The expected costs of external failure, however, may actually be lower relative to first-best.

Those changes can be defined thanks to known indicator of operating leverage (DOL). V alue of this indicator helps {{to show how the}} structure of costs affects proportional changes of the EBIT. One of the most important rules in quality management is to minimize total quality costs and to avoid external and internal failures. Minimization of failure costs (variable costs) causes increasing of prevention and <b>appraisal</b> <b>costs</b> (fixed costs). In this situation, management of company must not forget that increasing of fixed costs and decreasing of total revenue causes increasing of company risk {{at the same time and}} near future.

Company (by the improvement actions) is able to change the structure of quality costs which has direct influence on the EBIT.

The increase in occupational accidents in recent years, together with the decrease in productivity and production efficiency, has mooted direct and indirect costs for companies. Quality costs are the type of costs which arise due to the activities implemented in order to preclude possible flaws, to the planned quality tests,and to flaws that appear during the production or customer delivery processes. Quality costs are classified in British Standards 6143 as follows:(a) Prevention Costs(b) Appraisal Costs(c) Internal Failure Costs(d) External Failure CostsAs regards quality costs, occupational accidents that may produce highly excessive costs can be prevented by executing {{a good number of}} prevention activities. With the analysis of workflow processes in the established or subsequently established engine park, quality costs of those processes can be measured and evaluated in terms of occupational accidents. Despite prevention costs and <b>appraisal</b> <b>costs,</b> occupational accidents may still continue to appear in companies owing to various reasons. Those accidents may cause cessation in the production flow, or effect defective products. All these costs combined may constitute a considerable amount of internal failure costs.

Real estate valuations, which encompass appraisals and other value estimation methods, {{play a critical role}} in mortgage underwriting by providing evidence that the market value of a property is sufficient to help mitigate losses if the borrower is unable to repay the loan. However, recent turmoil in the mortgage market has raised questions about mortgage underwriting practices, including the quality and credibility of some valuations. An investigation into industry appraisal practices by the New York State Attorney General led to an agreement in 2008 between the Attorney General; Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the enterprises); and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), which regulates the enterprises. This agreement included the Home Valuation Code of Conduct (HVCC), which set forth certain appraiser independence requirements for loans sold to the enterprises and took effect in 2009. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Pub. L.
