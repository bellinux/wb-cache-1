30|$|A macro-PL of low-density GaAs DE QDs with 105 -nm Al 0.3 Ga 0.7 As {{cap layer}} at 12  K was {{observed}} after RTA. Low-density GaAs DE QDs were formed by As 4 injection on Ga droplets of Figure  1 b. The emission of low-density GaAs DE QDs was verified at approximately 773  nm in Figure  1 c. Based on {{the result of}} macro-PL, a μ-PL of low-density GaAs DE QDs (approximately 4 QDs/μm 2) at 16  K was performed. Figure  1 d shows exciton (X)/biexciton (XX) behavior {{in the range of}} 1.654 to 1.657  eV. Exciton and biexciton behavior can be characterized by the value of biexciton binding energy [17]. A few studies have reported 3 to 5  meV for the biexciton binding energy of GaAs QDs [17, 18]. The diameter of QDs in such studies was less than approximately 50  nm. In our case, the biexciton binding energy was approximately 1.2  meV, and the diameter of QDs was 70 [*]~[*] 90  nm. The relatively small biexciton binding energy for the present QDs would be attributed to a large size of QDs, since an increase of radius of QDs reduces biexciton binding energy [19]. For the exciton peak, a full width at half maximum (FWHM) showed approximately 136 μeV. Mano et al. have reported that narrow linewidth around 35 μeV has been observed from an emission of a single GaAs DE QD [6]. Since the value of FWHM depends on the local environment, regardless of QD emission energy, this larger FWHM value could be reduced by improving the quality of the barrier in QD structure, for instance, by annealing during growth [6, 20]. The optical properties of low-density GaAs DE QDs of the authors’ sample are covered in detail at the other <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> [21].|$|E

40|$|Nowadays many {{mathematical}} journals {{are published}} electronically, in general in {{portable document format}} (PDF). For example, the servers of the American Mathematical Society (AMS) contain at present more than 4700 articles published electronically from 1996 to date in the journals of the AMS that are accessible and searchable online to subscribers via the internet address: [URL] The PDF-format offers many advantages over the traditional paper format <b>of</b> a printed <b>article.</b> Authorized users can also link from journal articles references to the reviews in the Mathematical Reviews of the AMS, and in due course {{from there to the}} original quoted articles, if available in PDF. The online access also allows to make printouts <b>of</b> wanted <b>articles</b> at the user�s printer and to view abstracts <b>of</b> recently posted <b>articles</b> to be published shortly. In view of the vaste literature in mathematics the search functions provided by the software of a distributed digital library for specific articles and/or specific results or concepts explained in such an article are very useful for researchers and graduate students. They also would like to have such a comfortable access to the back issues of the mathematical journals published only in paper format. The proofs of many important old theorems have never been incorporated into standard textbooks because they are still too complicated to be derived from generally known theoretical results. Therefore modern research articles have to quote arguments, methods, partial and final results of old papers. Thus it is desirable to retrodigitize the back issues of a mathematical journal and combine them with the electronically published recent issues {{in such a way that}} all the volumes of the resulting digital journal are searchable and linked to "Mathematical Reviews" or "Zentralblatt Mathematik. " Through these review journals the retrodigitized volumes could then be linked to all other mathematical journals belonging to a distributed digital mathematical library. In particular, an authorized user of such a library would be able to read on screen an original article and a cited article or a review at the same time. This retrodigitization task is very demanding and requires a deep understanding of mathematics, computer science and the support of the publisher. It is the purpose <b>of</b> this survey <b>article</b> to describe a solution found by the author�s study group in the pilot project "Retrodigitization of the journal Archiv der Mathematik" financially supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft from 1 April, 1997 until 80 September, 2000. Using the IBM digital library database [4] and the MILESS software [7] developed by the Computer Center of Essen University we have been able to construct a prototype of a searchable and retrievable digital library "Archiv der Matheinatik. " It contains 1) the retrodigitized volumes 60 (1998) - 67 (1996) in MVD format, 2) the electronically published volumes 68 (1997) - 73 (1999) in PDF format. The cited journal <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> the <b>references</b> <b>of</b> all 13 volumes are recognized au- tomatically as well as the layout of the first page <b>of</b> each <b>article.</b> Thus it is possible to produce the bibliographic data including the ISSN <b>of</b> all journal <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> the 13 volumes and their references in XML format. In particular, all these articles and the cited journal <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> their <b>references</b> can be linked automatically to MathSciNet or Zentralblatt MATH. The methods developed in this pilot project can be adjusted for the retrodigitization of other mathematical journals and older back issues of "Archiv der Matheinatik.

50|$|Apart from {{monitoring}} the electrical properties of a dielectric, the CAFM can be {{also used to}} alter its properties by applying an electrical field locally. In particular, the CAFM is especially useful to determine which locations of the samples lead to premature BD, which can provide essential information about {{the reliability of the}} samples. The CAFM also helped to confirm the percolation theory of the BD by experimentally proving {{that this is a very}} local phenomenon that occurs in small areas typically below 100 nm2. Lateral propagations of the BD event can also be detected by CAFM. The severity of the BD event can also be studied from the dielectric breakdown induced epitaxy, which can be observed from subsequent topographic images collected with the CAFM after the voltage ramp. Similarly, the analysis of the BD recovery (resistive switching, RS) can also be monitored by CAFM. All the capabilities of the CAFM for studying resistive switching in dielectrics have been summarized in the review <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference.</b> Unlike a normal AFM, the CAFM can be also used to perform local photolithography via bias-assisted local anodic oxidation (LAO). Nowadays the CAFM technique has expanded to many other fields of science, including physics, materials science, chemistry and engineering (among many others), and it has been used to study different materials and/or structures, including nanoparticles, molecules, nanowires, carbon nanotubes, two dimensional (2D) materials, coatings, photoelectricity and piezoelectricity (among others). As of June 14 of 2016, the CAFM had been used in 1325 journal research articles, and it has become a popular tool in nanosciences.|$|R
