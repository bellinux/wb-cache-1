The associated structural changes of cellulose were evaluated by X-ray scattering, solid-state NMR and infrared spectroscopy. The high pressure treatment promoted the growth of crystalline domains predominantly via lateral aggregation (cocrystallization) and, to some extent, due to the accretion of cellulose from noncrystalline domains (recrystallization). The treated pulps exhibited increment {{of the amount of}} strongly bound water and improved accessibility to amorphous domains. The high pressure treatment of dried sulphite pulp led to restoration, at least partially, of its swelling capacity thus diminishing the hornification features. Pressure treated dried sulphite pulp showed improved fibre bonding capacity at simultaneously increased bulk of the produced handsheets. The results obtained clearly showed the potential of high pressure treatments for the modification of cellulosic fibres in different applications...|$|E
40|$|Spent {{sulphite}} liquor (SSL) {{is the main}} byproduct of <b>acid</b> <b>sulphite</b> pulping. Its main components are lignosulphonates (LS) and monomeric sugars. SSL is typically intended as binder, emulsifier or additive in concretes due to its high amount of LS. Sugars can be converted into high value-added products such as xylitol, PHB or biofuels among others; by means of fermentation processes. However, a separation step to remove the compounds that can act as fermentation inhibitors, as LS, is needed. Membrane technology allows the separation of sugars and LS from the SSL because of their different size of molecular weight. In the present study, ceramic membranes with different cut-offs (15 kDa, 5 kDa and 1 kDa) were used. 15 kDa membrane offered the best results according to LS concentration in the retentate stream, 5 kDa membrane the highest LS removal in permeate stream, and 1 kDa membrane the minimum sugar losses in the permeate stream. Because of this, {{the combination of the}} three membranes in a series system was proposed. In this way, an increase in LS removal in the final permeate was achieved (72. 78...|$|E

40|$|Ethylene {{could be}} formed by a model system {{containing}} lipoxygenase, linolenate, sulphite and methional. The system had an optimal pH of 7. 8. Free radicals formed during the lipoxygenase-catalyzed oxidation of linolenate {{were thought to}} initiate sulphite oxidation. Hydroxyl radicals formed during sulphite oxidation reacted with methional. Ethylene {{was one of the}} products of the reaction. [...] Ethylene could also be formed from a model system containing linoleic <b>acid</b> hydroperoxide, <b>sulphite</b> and methional. The pH optimum was 5. 0. It is thought that two species were responsible for converting the methional to ethylene, the hydroxyl radical, formed during sulphite oxidation and singlet oxygen which probably arose from the collision of two sec-peroxy radicals. [...] Studies of oxygen uptake by a LAHPO/sulphite system showed that the hydroxyl radical was formed during sulphite oxidation and may be a chain carrying species. Because both hydroxyl radicals and methional inhibited sulphite oxidation initiated by LAHPO it was thought that methional was reacting with hydroxyl radicals in our system. Because inhibitors of sulphite oxidation only partially inhibited ethylene formation it was thought that another species, not formed during sulphite oxidation could also be responsible for the conversion of methional to ethylene. [...] The evidence for singlet oxygen production by linoleic <b>acid</b> hydroperoxide and <b>sulphite</b> came from three techniques - thin layer analysis of the products of diphenylfuran oxidation, inhibitor studies on diphenylfuran exudation using fluorescence spectrophotometry and chemiluminescence. Diphenylfuran was converted by linoleic <b>acid</b> hydroperoxide and <b>sulphite</b> to cis-dibenzoylethylene, the product formed when diphenylfuran reacts with singlet oxygen. Both diphenylfuran oxidation and chemiluminescence were inhibited by singlet oxygen quenchers and antioxidants but not inhibitors of sulphite oxidation.

The degree of condensation of L-R was higher than that of DL but lower than that of L-SSL. The condensed structures in L-R mainly originate from C 6 -linked syringyl units.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the short term}} scheduling problem of industrial plants, where two real case studies were analysed. Mathematical programming models were developed leading to Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems. Based on the general Resource Task Network (RTN) process representation, the models use either a discrete or a continuous time representation with a common reference grid for all resource. The first case study consists of a resource constrained four batch digester system of an <b>acid</b> <b>sulphite</b> pulp mill. Two different types of models were developed: one for the scheduling operational problem, and other for the batch digester operation during the heating stage the process bottleneck. In the scheduling model, steam availability is modelled through {{the definition of a}} superstructure including the most relevant heating alternatives. The duration of the several heating tasks was estimated through the use of the process model: a distributed heterogeneous dynamic model in gPROMS validated with plant data. The second case study involved a three parallel production line polymer compounding plant, whose equipment's require cleaning between product changeovers. To address this problem a very effective user friendly scheduling tool was developed, which consists of a general scheduling model coupled with the capabilities of Microsoft Excel for data handling and analysis. As outputs the user can access the optimal schedules for a number of different objectives such us: production maximisation, cleaning times minimization and tardiness minimisation.

40|$|The {{colouring}} {{matter is the}} name applied to a coloured material believed {{to be present in}} chemical wood pulps and regarded, by workers in the field, to be of considerable importance in the bleaching of these pulps. In the production of a good quality white pulp from wood, two main steps are involved, namely the "cooking" of the wood, and the bleaching of the raw pulp obtained. [ [...] . ] Of the two main types of chemical pulps used commercially, namely, (a) <b>acid</b> or <b>sulphite</b> pulps, (prepared by heating under pressure with acid bisulphite solutions), and (b) alkaline pulps (prepared by heating under pressure with aqueous alkalies), the latter present by far the greater problem {{from the point of view}} of bleaching. Kraft pulps are especially difficult to bleach to a permanent white colour. The final colour is almost always slightly yellowish despite the fact that the "chlorine consumption" of these pulps is much larger than with sulphite and soda pulps. At this point it may be advisable to define the terms kraft and sulphate, since the careless use of these terms often leads to confusion. Sulphate pulp is produced by any alkaline "cooking" process in which the alkali lost is replaced by the addition of sodium sulphate in the regeneration of the "spent-liquor". Kraft is a type of sulphate pulp which has been intentionally undercooked to obtain a pulp of high strength. [ [...] . ...|$|R

40|$|Lignocellulose {{constitutes}} a vast renewable resource {{for the production}} of, for example, paper and bioethanol. The potential of using laccase and oxalate-degrading enzymes in novel applications for the processing of lignocellulose was investigated in this work. Laccase cDNAs from the white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor were characterised and expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris. The lcc 2 cDNA was found to encode a laccase isoenzyme of 499 amino-acid residues preceded by a 21 -residue signal peptide, and the sequence showed identity with Edman degradation data for T. versicolor laccase A. With S. cerevisiae, a 16 -fold higher laccase activity was obtained by lowering the temperature of cultivation from 28 ºC to 19 ºC. P. pastoris transformants that were cultivated at 19 ºC provided five times higher laccase activity than transformants kept at 28 ºC, indicating the importance of low temperature for optimal production of heterologous laccase in yeast systems in general. The heterologous expression of laccase by S. cerevisiae was improved further by simultaneous overexpression of the homologous t-SNARE protein Sso 2 and by optimising pH and aeration. Phenolic compounds inhibit the fermentation of sugars in lignocellulose hydrolysates to bioethanol by S. cerevisiae. Increased resistance to phenolic compounds and improved production of ethanol was obtained by using laccase-expressing S. cerevisiae for fermentation of a dilute acid hydrolysate of spruce. The formation of calcium oxalate in process water from the {{pulp and paper industry}} gives rise to the problem of calcium oxalate scaling. Oxalate-degrading enzymes could potentially be utilised for the prevention of calcium oxalate scaling in the pulp and paper industry, and for the analysis of the levels of oxalic acid in recirculated process water. Three cDNAs encoding oxalate oxidase from barley and wheat were expressed in Escherichia coli. The use of Origami B(DE 3), a strain that allows disulphide formation in its cytoplasm, was found to be of critical importance in achieving successful expression in E. coli. Treatment of a series of six industrial bleaching filtrates with barley oxalate oxidase indicated that the efficiency of oxalic acid degradation was highly dependent on the chemical composition of the filtrate. Analysis of the filtrates showed the presence of compounds that had an inhibitory effect on oxalate oxidase. The inhibition could be alleviated by treatment of the filtrates with anion exchanger, cation exchanger and, to a lesser extent, uncharged resin. Chlorate, formic <b>acid,</b> <b>sulphite</b> and hydrogen peroxide, iron(II), iron(III) and copper(II) were identified as potential oxalate oxidase inhibitors in the bleaching filtrates. Comparison of oxalate decarboxylase and oxalate oxidase in eleven filtrates showed that oxalate decarboxylase performed better than oxalate oxidase in nine of the filtrates, whereas the opposite was observed in one filtrate. Analysis of the filtrates indicated that the difference in performance between the enzymes in D stage filtrates could be largely attributed to chlorate, which strongly inhibited oxalate oxidase but not oxalate decarboxylase...|$|E
40|$|O {{principal}} objectivo deste trabalho consistiu na produção de celulose microcristalina (CMC) por hidrólise ácida diluída de pasta de Eucalyptus globulus branqueada, obtida pelo processo sulfito ácido. De modo a averiguar os efeitos da hornificação, submeteu-se esta pasta a diferentes métodos de secagem e estudou-se a possibilidade de superar esse fenómeno através do tratamento das pastas a altas pressões. Este tipo de processamento tem-se revelado muito eficaz na modificação de biopolímeros, pelo que foram analisados os efeitos que este poderia exercer sobre as propriedades da celulose. Os resultados obtidos mostram que ao final de 3 h de hidrólise se obtêm fibras de CMC brancas, com um grau médio de polimerização (GP) entre 310 a 330 unidades de glucopiranose e um grau de cristalinidade (GC) de ~ 77 %, sendo a pasta seca a 140 ºC (à semelhança da obtida ao nível das indústrias papeleira) a que se revelou mais eficiente para esta obtenção. Quando previamente à reacção de hidrólise se sujeita esta pasta a uma pressão de 4000 atm durante 10 minutos, obtém-se um GP~ 300 e verifica-se um aumento do GC da CMC de 2 %. Confirmou-se que o tratamento de pastas a altas pressões provoca um aumento significativo da largura média de cristalito e conduz à incorporação de água na estrutura das amostras, originando fibras mais flexíveis. Este processo revela-se capaz de superar alguns dos problemas causados pela hornificação, visto conseguir aumentar a capacidade de absorção de água das pastas tratadas. São no entanto necessários mais estudos complementares neste campo, de modo a optimizar o valor de pressão a aplicar, assim como outros parâmetros processuais. The aim of {{this work}} was the production of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) by diluted acid hydrolysis of bleached <b>acid</b> <b>sulphite</b> Eucalyptus globulus chemical pulp. In order to evaluate the effects on swelling induced by hornification, pulp was submitted to the drying under different conditions, trying to overcome the hornification consequences by the treatment at a high hydraulic pressure. Due to the previous success in the modification of biopolymers with high pressure treatments, part of this work was devoted to the application of this new technique on the cellulosic fibres. Results showed that after 3 hours of hydrolysis, white colour MCC fibres are obtained, with a levelling-off degree of polymerisation (LODP) between 310 to 330 units of glucopiranose and a degree of crystallinity (DC) of about 77 %. During MCC production, pulp dried at 140 ºC (similar to those obtained at mill conditions) {{has proven to be}} the most effective. MCC with LODP of 300 and DC of 79 % was obtained when the high pressure treatment was applied before acid hydrolysis. It was confirmed that high pressure treatment of pulp causes {{a significant increase in the}} average width of crystallites and leads to the incorporation of bounded water into the samples structure, leading to more flexible cellulosic fibres, more accessible for the acid hydrolysis. This process has proved to be capable of overcoming some of the hornification issues, because it increases the water absorption capacity of treated fibres. However, more studies are needed in order to optimize the value of pressure to apply, as well as other process parameters. Mestrado em Engenharia Químic...|$|E

The inoculated packages were irradiated at 3 kGy (tortellini) and 2 kGy (Cordon Bleu) with a 60 Co radiation source. The applied radiation doses were sensorially acceptable for these products. The experimental batches of tortellini were stored at 15 °C, while the Cordon Bleu samples were stored at 5 and 9 °C. Unirradiated samples were kept together with the respective irradiated ones. Storage was continued for 4 weeks and microbiological tests were performed {{before and after the}} irradiation, and subsequently after every seven days. Besides selective estimation of the counts of the test organisms, total aerobic counts were evaluated in all samples and in case of Cordon Bleu, colony counts of lactic <b>acid</b> bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, <b>sulphite</b> reducing clostridia, yeasts and moulds were also selectively estimated. The 3 -kGy dose reduced the S. aureus count in tortellini below the detection limit (logCFU= 0. 26), and it remained undetectably low in the irradiated samples during all 28 days of storage, while the S. aureus count in the unirradiated samples increased up to 108 CFU/g during 8 days. The Listeria count in Cordon Bleu was reduced by irradiation from the initial count of 6. 1 to 3. 5 logCFU/g. At 5 °C storage, this residual count remained stagnant up to 3 – 4 weeks, but started to increase at 9 °C after one week of storage. In the unirradiated samples, the Listeria count increased hundred-fold during 4 weeks at 5 °C, and during 2 weeks at 9 °C. Sulphite reducing clostridia were, and remained, undetectable (< 0. 48 logCFU/g) in all samples even at 9 °C. The limiting factor of the shelf-life of the unirradiated poultry products was the growth of lactic acid bacteria at 9 °C, whereas enhanced lipid oxidation was an unwanted side-effect of radiation treatment. From these studies it can be concluded that the potential risk posed by the investigated non-sporeforming pathogenic bacteria could be considerably reduced by gamma irradiation, however, storage temperature remains a crucial factor of safety and methods should be developed to counteract the lipid-oxidative effect of the radiation processing...|$|R

Dissolved oxygen and the oxygen in {{headspace}} were measured in the resulting 17 wines. Free and total SO 2 concentrations, ascorbic acid concentration, colour, redox potential, and antioxidative capacity were measured regularly in wine samples. After six months of storage, the wines were evaluated using sensory descriptive analysis. It was again proved that wine exposure to oxygen at bottling {{plays a key role}} in white wine development during storage. High oxygen ingress may greatly influence the redox state of wine and affect the important quality parameters including colour, free and total SO 2, and the overall sensory quality of wine. Free and total sulphur dioxide loss and the decline in ascorbic acid could be linked to the total consumed oxygen content. It was observed that in the presence of ascorbic <b>acid</b> less <b>sulphite</b> was consumed. Ascorbic acid addition also contributed to the fruity and fresh character of the bottled wines, which indicates its strong antioxidant. However, when combined with high oxygen concentration, ascorbic acid addition promoted enhanced white wine browning. This was scavenged in the wines with higher free SO 2 concentrations. Based on the data shown, careful control of the oxygen ingress during bottling is crucial for white wine quality. Ascorbic acid addition seems to have positive sensory effects on the development of wines during the post-bottling period. However, the possible wine browning, associated with ascorbic acid, should be taken into account. On the contrary, sulphur dioxide, in case of the Riesling wine studied, seems to be less effective to prevent negative sensory effects in wines due to excessive exposure to oxygen, but may simultaneously decrease oxidative browning in wines with ascorbic acid addition. In summary, low oxygen ingress at bottling combined with low iron and copper concentrations, moderate additions of ascorbic acid and sulphur dioxide seem to be a good oxygen management strategy and offer a good potential to improve quality and extent the shelf-life of white wines. Der Weltweinmarkt und speziell der europäische Weinmarkt wird heute oft als übersättigt angesehen. Der Erfolg einzelner Weinproduzenten hängt daher vom Verständnis und der Adaption an die Bedürfnisse der Verbraucher ab. Bei Weiß- und Roséweinen schätzen Verbraucher derzeit besonders einen fruchtigen, frischen Charakter. Oxidative Noten sind unerwünscht. Dennoch gehören sie zu den häufigsten Weinfehlern. Aus Weinwettbewerben wurde berichtet, dass bis zu 48 % der fehlerhaften Weine von den Prüfern wegen Oxidationsnoten beanstandet wurden. Sauerstoff kann vom Wein während des ganzen Weinbereitungsprozesses aufgenommen werden. Die Sauerstoffaufnahme hängt im Wesentlichen von den Prozessen und der verwendeten technologischen Ausstattung ab. Unter normalen Bedingungen kann Sauerstoff bis zu 8. 8 mg/L im Wein gelöst werden. Gelöster Sauerstoff in Wein wird in der Regel durch chemische Reaktionen von molekularem Sauerstoff mit Weininhaltsstoffen bis unter die Nachweisgrenze verringert. Die vielfältigen Reaktionen der Weinoxidation sind sehr komplexe Prozesse. Ihre Auswirkungen variieren erheblich. Beeinflussende Faktoren sind Weintyp, Weinbehandlung, Sauerstoffmenge, chemische Zusammensetzung des Weines, pH-Wert, Lagertemperatur, Belichtung, Metallgehalt und Redox-Zustand des Weines. Die Wirkung von Sauerstoff ist äußerst komplex, die Weinfarbe und das Aroma kann verbessert oder gar ruiniert werden. Weißweine werden durch Sauerstoff häufig negativ verändert. Der Sauerstoff führt hier zu schnellem Aromaverlust bis hin zu oxidativer Bräunung. Gerade dies wird vom Verbraucher oft negativ bewertet. Bei Rotweinen hingegen kann Sauerstoff gezielt eingesetzt werden um die Farbe zu stabilisieren oder reduktive Aromen zu entfernen. Die Forschung über Weinoxidation konzentriert sich derzeit auf Experimente in Modell-Lösungen. Diese Studien geben wertvolle Informationen über Mechanismen und Hintergründe der Oxidation. Jedoch befassen sich derzeit nur wenige Experimente mit echtem Wein. Bei echten Weinen bietet sich die Möglichkeit analytische und sensorische Daten miteinander zu verknüpfen. Wichtiger Punkt der vorliegenden Arbeit ist die umfassende Bewertung verschiedener Einflußfaktoren auf die Weinalterung. Aus den Ergebnissen wurde eine Strategie für die Verbesserung der Qualität und einer Verlängerung der Haltbarkeit von Weißweinen entwickelt. Methodenvergleich zur O 2 -und CO 2 - Bestimmung im Wein Der erste Teil der vorliegenden Arbeit besteht in der Bestimmung von zuverlässigen Methoden zur Quantifizierung des gelösten Sauerstoffs im Wein. Da das gelöste Kohlendioxid im Wein die Sauerstoffkonzentration beeinflussen kann, wurde die CO 2 -Menge ebenfalls berücksichtigt. Folglich war die Entwicklung einer Methode zur Kohlendioxid-Bestimmung auch von großer Bedeutung für die weiteren Versuche, die in dieser Arbeit beschrieben sind. Das Hauptziel der ersten Studie war es, einen Überblick zu aktuellen Sauerstoff- und Kohlendioxid-Messmethoden zu geben sowie verschiedene auf dem Markt verfügbare Instrumente für Kohlendioxid- und Sauerstoff-Messung in Wein zu vergleichen. Sauerstoff-Messungen wurden mit PreSens, OxyQC und Orbisphere 3650 durchgeführt. Zur Kohlendioxid-Bestimmung wurden CarboQC, Orbisphere 3658 und Schüttelzylinder verwendet. Probenflaschen wurden mit Konzentrationen im Bereich von 0 bis 2200 mg/L für Kohlendioxid und von 0 bis 12 mg/L für Sauerstoff abgefüllt. O 2 - und CO 2 - Messungen erfolgten mit den sechs Instrumenten nacheinander bei 20 °C, nachdem die Flaschen für 10 Minuten geschüttelt wurden. Die anschließend berechneten Konzentrationen an Sauerstoff und Kohlendioxid wurden für die Erstellung von Korrelationen und Regression-Tests verwendet. Die drei untersuchten Instrumente für CO 2 -Bestimmung zeigten reproduzierbare Messergebnisse (R 2 = 98 %) im Bereich von 0 bis 1500 mg/L. Doch in den Weinproben bei dem 20 °C übersättigten Bereich (> 1500 mg/L) zeigten CarboQC und Orbisphere 3658 signifikant höhere Präzision (R 2 = 99 %) im Vergleich zum Schüttelzylinder. Dies ist logisch, da während der Befüllung des Zylinders das Kohlendioxid verloren geht. Die Ergebnisse der Sauerstoff-Messungen deuteten darauf hin, dass PreSens, sowie auch OxyQC und Orbisphere 3650 eine im gesamten überwachten Bereich der Sauerstoffkonzentrationen verlässliche und kongruente Werte liefern. Aufgrund der Flexibilität der Minisensoren, die direkt in die Flasche eingeklebt werden können, erwies sich die nicht-invasive O 2 -Messung mittels PreSens als vorteilhaft. Darüber hinaus erlaubt diese Technik nicht nur die Bestimmung vom gelöstem Sauerstoff, sondern auch die Messung vom gasförmigen Sauerstoff im Kopfraum. Aus diesen Gründen wurde das PreSens-Gerät für weitere Experimente ausgewählt. Einfluss vom Kopfraumvolumen und Eisen- und Kupfer-Zugabe auf Oxidation in Modell-Lösung und Riesling Wein: chemische und sensorische Veränderungen In früheren veröffentlichten Studien in Modell-Lösungen wurde die wichtige Rolle von Eisen und Kupfer in Oxidationsreaktionen in Wein deutlich gezeigt. Im zweiten Teil der vorliegenden Arbeit wurden die Wirkungen von unterschiedlichen Sauerstoff-Mengen bei der Abfüllung untersucht. Des Weiteren wurde der Einfluss von Eisen- und Kupfer-Zusätzen auf die Sauerstoffverbrauchsrate, Schwefeldioxid und Farbe in Modell-Lösung und Riesling Wein geprüft. Die Modell-Lösung wurde aus hochreinem Wasser, Glycerin, (+) -Weinsäure, Ethanol, Gallussäure und Kaliummetabisulfit zusammengestellt, außerdem wurde die SO 2 -Konzentration auf 50 mg/L eingestellt. 200 L Riesling (Jahrgang 2010) wurde unter Verwendung von Standard-Techniken der Weinbereitung produziert und anschließend mit Kaliumhexacyanoferrat behandelt, um die Metalle bzw. Eisen und Kupfer zu entfernen. Modell-Lösung und Riesling wurden in 500 -mL Flaschen mit und ohne Zusatz von Eisen (0. 1 mg/L) und Kupfer (0. 05 mg/L) abgefüllt. Die Sauerstoffkonzentration in Flaschen wurde mit Luft im Kopfraum (0, 50 und 100 mL für Modell-Lösung und 0, 20 und 40 mL für Riesling) eingestellt. Die Eisen- und Kupferkonzentrationen, Gesamtmenge an verbrauchtem Sauerstoff, Schwefeldioxid, Absorption (E 420) wurden während der Lagerzeit beobachtet. Zusätzlich wurde die sensorische Bewertung von Riesling Weinen mittels Dreieckstests und deskriptiver Analyse nach 90 und 240 Tagen Lagerung durchgeführt. Die Ergebnisse zeigten große Unterschiede zwischen der Modell-Lösung und dem Riesling Wein. In der Modell-Lösung hatte das Kopfraumvolumen und der Metall-Zusatz dazu beigetragen, dass wesentliche Änderungen in Sauerstoffverbrauchsrate, Farbe und freiem Schwefeldioxid entstanden. Der Eisen- und Kupfer-Zusatz erhöhte die Geschwindigkeit des Sauerstoff-Verbrauchs und führte zu erhöhtem Verbrauch der freien SO 2. Die intensive Farbentwicklung wurde in allen Weinen mit Eisen-Zusatz festgestellt. Das Experiment mit Riesling mit vergleichbaren Parametern zeigte einen starken Einfluss des Kopfraumvolumens. Die Sauerstoffverbrauchsrate und die oxidative Bräunung korrelierten stark mit dem Kopfraumvolumen. Im Gegensatz zum Modell-Lösung-Experiment hatte die Zugabe von geringen Mengen an Eisen und Kupfer keinen Einfluss auf die Farbe und den Sauerstoffverbrauch im Riesling Wein. Sensorische Unterschiede zwischen den Weinen mit 0, 20 und 40 mL Kopfraum wurden bereits nach drei Monaten Lagerung bei 15 °C durch die Dreieckstests nachgewiesen. Die deskriptive sensorische Analyse nach sechs und neun Monaten Lagerung bestätigte den negativen Einfluss von großem Kopfraumvolumen. Dies beweist die große Bedeutung der Sauerstoffaufnahme bei der Abfüllung auf die Weinqualität. Außerdem waren Metallmengen im Riesling Wein, auch in den Varianten ohne Eisen- und Kupferzusatz ausreichend, die Oxidationsprozesse zu initialisieren. Da die geringen Eisen- und Kupferzugaben eine erhebliche Wirkung in der Modell-Lösung und nicht im Wein hatten, waren weitere Studien mit größeren Mengen an Eisen und Kupfer in Riesling Wein erforderlich. Einfluss von Sauerstoff im Kopfraum, Eisen- und Kupferzusatz auf Sauerstoffverbrauchsrate, Schwefeldioxidverlust, Farbe und sensorische Eigenschaften von Riesling Wein Um die Wirkung von Eisen und Kupfer weiter auf Weißweinoxidation zu untersuchen, wurde Riesling Wein mit/ohne Zugabe von 1 mg/L Eisen und 0. 5 mg/L Kupfer abgefüllt. Dies entspricht den durchschnittlichen Eisen- und Kupfer-Konzentrationen in Weinen aus Baden-Württemberg. Die Sauerstoffmengen wurden mit verschiedenen Kopfraumvolumen in den Flaschen (0, 10 und 20 mL) bestimmt. Im Gegensatz zum vorangegangenen Versuch, hatte die Zugabe von 1 mg/L Eisen und 0. 5 mg/L Kupfer einen signifikanten Einfluss auf den Sauerstoffverbrauch, Verlust von freiem SO 2 während der Lagerung und auf die sensorischen Eigenschaften im Wein. Der Eisen- und Kupfer-Zusatz katalysierte deutlich den Sauerstoffverbrauch. Der Schwefeldioxid-Verlust war proportional zur Gesamtmenge an verbrauchtem Sauerstoff. Zusätzlich wurde der SO 2 -Abbau in allen Varianten mit Eisen und Kupfer im Vergleich zu den Varianten ohne Eisen- und Kupferzugabe signifikant erhöht. Obwohl die Farbänderungen nach 90 Tagen Lagerung nicht festgestellt werden konnten, waren die erheblichen sensorischen Veränderungen bereits erkennbar. Der Sauerstoff, wie auch der Eisen- und Kupferzusatz hatten Einfluss auf die sensorische Bewertung der Weine. Bei niedrigen Sauerstoffkonzentration (0 mL Kopfraum) hatten Metalle durch die Eliminierung von reduzierten Aromen eine positive Wirkung. Die Weine mit 10 und 20 mL Kopfraum und zugesetztem Eisen und Kupfer zeigten geringere Ausprägungen in Attributen wie Frucht, Citrus, tropischen Aromen und erhöhte Werte in UTA und hatten einen deutlichen oxidierten Charakter.
