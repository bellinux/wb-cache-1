5|$|Spain's loss of Gibraltar {{and other}} Spanish territories in the Mediterranean was resented by the Spanish public and monarchy alike. In 1717 Spanish forces retook Sardinia and in 1718 Sicily, {{both of which}} had been ceded to Austria under the Treaty of Utrecht. The {{effective}} Spanish repudiation of the treaty prompted the British initially to propose handing back Gibraltar in exchange for a peace agreement <b>and,</b> <b>when</b> <b>that</b> failed, to declare war on Spain. The Spanish gains were quickly reversed, a Spanish expedition to Scotland in 1719 supporting the Jacobites was defeated and peace was eventually restored by the Treaty of The Hague.|$|E
5|$|Stafford {{received}} further favour {{from the}} Crown soon after, being granted the wardship {{of the son}} and heir of John Tuchet, 4th Baron Audley, <b>and,</b> <b>when</b> <b>that</b> was taken back in 1409, he received estates in Shropshire and Cambridgeshire in compensation. Unusually ("striking", says Helen Castor) {{he was not a}} retainer of the crown or the Duchy of Lancaster, in Staffordshire, but rather of Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham, for whom Humphrey represented the interests of the main Stafford family.|$|E

5|$|The {{puzzle of}} how {{embryonic}} development was controlled {{began to be}} solved using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. The step-by-step control of its embryogenesis was visualized by attaching fluorescent dyes of different colours to specific types of protein made by genes expressed in the embryo. A dye such as green fluorescent protein, originally from a jellyfish, was typically attached to an antibody specific to a fruit fly protein, forming a precise indicator of where <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>that</b> protein appeared in the living embryo.|$|E
5|$|Until Thomas Becket's fame overshadowed Dunstan's, {{he was the}} {{favourite}} {{saint of}} the English people.

5|$|In 1326, however, Edward was deposed by an {{alliance}} of Isabella and her lover, Roger Mortimer. Edward was eventually captured by Isabella's forces and {{the custody of the}} king was assigned to Henry, Earl of Lancaster, who had backed Isabella's invasion. Henry, reoccupying most of the Lancaster lands, was made constable of Kenilworth and Edward was transported there in late 1326; Henry's legal title to the castle was finally confirmed the following year. Kenilworth was chosen for this purpose by Isabella probably both because it was a major fortification, and also because of the symbolism of its former owners' links to popular ideals of freedom and good government. Royal writs were issued in Edward's name by Isabella from Kenilworth until the next year. A deputation of leading barons led by Bishop Orleton was then sent to Kenilworth to first persuade Edward to resign <b>and,</b> <b>when</b> <b>that</b> failed, to inform him that he had been deposed as king. Edward formally resigned as king in the great hall of the castle on 21 January 1326. As the months went by, however, it became clear that Kenilworth was proving a less than ideal location to imprison Edward. The castle was in a prominent part of the Midlands, in an area that held several nobles who still supported Edward and were believed to be trying to rescue him. Henry's loyalty was also coming under question. In due course, Isabella and Mortimer had Edward moved by night to Berkeley Castle, where he died shortly afterwards. Isabella continued to use Kenilworth as a royal castle until her fall from power in 1330.|$|E

5|$|In 1819, Rowan was {{appointed}} to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, serving until his resignation 1821. He was again elected to the state legislature in 1823. With the state reeling from the Panic of 1819, Rowan became the leader of a group of legislators dedicated to enacting laws favorable to the state's large debtor class. He believed {{the will of the people}} was sovereign and roundly denounced the Court of Appeals for striking down debt relief legislation as unconstitutional. He led the effort to impeach the offending justices, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>that</b> effort failed, spearheaded a movement to abolish the court entirely and replace it with a new one, touching off the Old Court – New Court controversy. New Court partisans in the legislature elected Rowan to the U.S. Senate in 1824. During his term, the nascent Whig Party ascended to power in the state legislature, and at the expiration of his term in 1831, the Whigs replaced him with party founder Henry Clay.|$|E
5|$|In 1862 Troy {{suffered}} {{another major}} fire, {{the worst in}} its history. A locomotive's spark ignited the wooden Green Island drawbridge that existed at the time, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>that</b> could not be contained to the bridge it spread to the east, ultimately devastating 507 buildings over a 16-block area. As before, the city rebuilt quickly, with the area along Fifth between Broadway and Grant Street, where Cummings built a row of houses between Fifth and Sixth, most strongly reflecting this era of rapid construction and reconstruction. The Gurley Building, too, rose in just eight months {{from the ashes of}} its predecessor. The nearby neighborhood also became desirable, with many local businessmen moving into newly built homes along Fifth.|$|E
5|$|Once {{registration}} {{had been}} completed and the deposits were made, the author was granted an exclusive right to control the copying of the book. Penalties for infringing this right were severe, with all infringing copies to be destroyed and large fines {{to be paid to}} both the copyright holder and the government; there was only a three-month statute of limitations on bringing a case, however. This exclusive right's length was dependent on when the book had been published. If it was published after 10 April 1710, the length of copyright was 14 years; if published before that date, 21 years. An author who survived until the copyright expired would be granted an additional 14-year term, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>that</b> ran out, the works would enter the public domain. Copyright under the Statute applied to Scotland and England, as well as Ireland when that country joined the union in 1800.|$|E

5|$|Randall's {{defense of}} smaller, less {{centralized}} government raised his profile among House Democrats, and they elevated him to Speaker in 1876. He held that post until the Democrats {{lost control of}} the House in 1881, and was considered a possible nominee for President in 1880 and 1884. Randall's support for high tariffs began to alienate him from most Democrats, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>that</b> party regained control of the House in 1883, he was denied another term as Speaker. Randall continued to serve in Congress as head of the Appropriations Committee. He remained a respected party leader, but gradually lost influence as the Democrats became more firmly wedded to free trade. Worsening health also curtailed his power until his death in 1890.|$|E
5|$|Several {{newspapers}} published {{images of}} Tomlinson's {{first encounter with}} police that evening. According to Barry Smith, Tomlinson left the newspaper stand outside Monument Tube Station at around 7pm. The Daily Mail published an image showing Tomlinson smoking a cigarette {{in front of a}} police van in Lombard Street. An eyewitness, IT worker Ross Hardy, said Tomlinson was drunk and refusing to move; a police van tried to nudge him out of the way, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>that</b> didn't work he was moved by four riot officers. The newspaper published a second image of him apparently being pushed by the police. On 16 April The Guardian published three images of Tomlinson taken at the same time.|$|E
5|$|The king {{attempted}} to deprive Neville of the chancellorship in 1236, which the bishop countered {{by claiming that}} {{as he had been}} appointed during the royal minority with the consent of the great council, only the council could dismiss him. In 1238 the cathedral chapter of the see of Winchester elected as Bishop of Winchester first William de Raley in opposition to the king's choice of William the Bishop of Valence, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>that</b> election was quashed, they elected Neville. His election to Winchester was quashed in 1239, leading to a quarrel with Henry III. Valence was the uncle of Eleanor of Provence, whom Henry had married in 1236. Valence had gained much influence with the king quite quickly, and worked to eliminate the older royal officials and institute reforms in the royal administration. This, along with the disputed election to Winchester, was the cause of Neville's fall from favour. Although Henry deprived Neville of the custody of the Great Seal from 1238 until 1242, Neville retained the title of chancellor until his death, thus entitling him to the revenues he would normally have received from the office. The Great Seal itself was held by a number of minor officials, probably to allow Henry greater control over its use by preventing the establishment of another powerful official who might interfere with his plans. But they lacked the power base that Neville had possessed, which enabled him to oppose the king.|$|E

5|$|When Nabis {{found out}} that Gythium had fallen to the allies he decided to abandon the {{remaining}} Laconian countryside that he controlled. Nabis sent envoys to Flamininus who offered Nabis a parley. The Romans attacked Sparta when the parley ended but the Spartans withstood the initial allied assaults. Nabis, however, seeing that the situation was hopeless agreed to surrender {{the city to the}} Romans. The Romans forced Nabis to abandon Argos and most of the coastal cities of Laconia. The Romans formed all the cities that had broken off from Sparta on the Laconian coast into the Union of Free Laconians. However, the Romans didn't strip Nabis of his powers because they wanted a state in the Peloponnese to counter the growing Achaean League. Nabis attacked Gythium two or three years later only to retreat after being unable to capture the city but in 192 BC he was assassinated by the Aetolians before {{he had a chance to}} attempt another attack on the city. In 189 BC, the Spartans, having been deprived of a port, attacked and captured the city of Las. The Acheans, threatened by the attack, demanded the surrender of those responsible for the attack <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>that</b> was refused they captured the city.|$|E
5|$|Wighard was a Saxon priest {{during the}} late 7th century, and a native of Kent. He served in the {{household}} of Archbishop Deusdedit of Canterbury, and was also a priest at Canterbury. The 8th-century writer Bede says that Wighard was selected to be Archbishop of Canterbury, {{and that he was}} sent to Rome to visit Pope Vitalian for confirmation and to receive his pallium. How exactly he was selected, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>that</b> occurred, is open to debate, as Bede himself had two different stories. The first one, related in his Historia Abbatum, stated that Wighard was selected by King Ecgberht of Kent. Fifteen years after Bede's completion of the Historia Abbatum, Bede wrote the Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, which states that Wighard was selected by Oswiu of Northumbria and Ecgberht with the consent of all the clergy and people. Some modern historians have followed Bede's second account, but others feel that only Ecgberht selected Wighard.|$|E
