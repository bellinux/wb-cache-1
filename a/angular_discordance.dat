The Great Unconformity has an irregular hilly surface. In case of the Sixtymile Formation, a small amount of relief, 20 m to 30 m, in the Sixtymile Canyon area was the result of resistance to erosion of the Middle Member of the Sixtymile Formation (fig. 4). Prior to the deposition of the Tapeats Sandstone, erosion removed all of the Upper Member of the Sixtymile from all but the central part of the Chuar syncline.|$|E

40|$|The Cambrian Tamdroust and Bab n’Ali Volcanic Complexes {{represent}} two magmatic episodes {{developed in}} the latest Ediacaran–Cambrian Atlas Rift of Morocco. Their rifting pulses were accompanied by accumulation of volcanosedimentary edifices (dominated by effusive lava flows in the former and explosive acidic aprons in the latter) associated with active tilting and uplift.

Previous interpretations of these discordances as pull-apart or compressive events are revised here and reinterpreted in an extensional (rifting) context associated with active volcanism.

40|$|Rocks {{correlated}} with the Hough Lake and Quirke Lake Groups of the Huronian Supergroup form part of a northeasterly trending corridor that separates 1750 Ma granitic intrusive rocks of the Chief Lake batholith from the 1850 Ma mafic intrusive rocks of the Sudbury Igneous Complex. This corridor is dissected by two major structural features; the Murray Fault Zone (MFZ) and the Long Lake Fault (LLF). Detailed structural mapping and microstructural analysis indicates that the LLF, which has juxtaposed Huronian rocks of different deformation style and metamorphism grade, was a more significant plane of dislocation than the MFZ. The sense of displacement along the LLF is high angle reverse in which rocks to the southeast have been raised relative {{to those in the}} northwest. South of the LLF Huronian rocks underwent ductile defonnation at amphibolite facies conditions. The strain was constrictional, defined by a triaxial strain ellipsoid in which X > Y > z. Calculations of a regional k value were approximately 1. 3. Penetrative ductile defonnation resulted {{in the development of a}} preferred crystallographic orientation in quartz as well as the elongation of quartz grains to fonn a regional southeast-northwest trending, subvertical lineation. Similar lithologies north of the LLF underwent dominantly brittle deformation under greenschist facies conditions. Deformation north of the LLF is characterized by the thrusting of structural blocks to form <b>angular</b> <b>discordances</b> in bedding orientation which were previously interpreted as folds. Ductile deformation occurred between 1750 and 1238 Ma and is {{correlated with}} a regional period of south over north reverse faulting that effected much of the southern Sudbury region. Post dating the reverse faulting event was a period of sedimentation as a conglomerate unit was deposited on vertically bedded Huronian rocks. Rocks in the study area were intruded by both mafic and felsic dykes. The 1238 Ma mafic dykes appear to have been offset during a period of dextral strike slip displacement along the major fault'). Indirect evidence indicates that this event occurred after the thrusting at 950 to 1100 Ma associated with the Grenvillian Orogeny...|$|R
40|$|On {{a global}} scale, the Crotone basin {{preserves}} {{one of the}} best-developed and most complete Pleistocene marine records available in outcrop, as important as those in California, New Zealand, and Japan. A deformed, markedly cyclothemic, lower to middle Pleistocene succession {{is present in the}} territory of San Mauro Marchesato (Crotone area, southern Italy), showing an overall shallowing trend from slope mudstones to marginal marine and continental deposits. Preservation and high resolution of cyclothems occurred through the interaction between high-amplitude relative sealevel fluctuations, a particular pattern of differential subsidence due to intrabasinal tectonics, and high rates of sediment supply. The studied succession was laid down in the Crotone basin under an extensional tectonic regime, following a major, middle Pliocene contractional phase probably of transpressional nature. Two major unconformities, locally accompanied by <b>angular</b> <b>discordances,</b> occur within the succession. The former, centered at ca. 1. 2 Ma, is thought to reflect the opening of the San Mauro sub basin within the Crotone basin in the early Pleistocene, following dextral transtensional motion along north- to north-northeast-trending faults. The latter, with a hiatus lasting from ca. 0. 65 to 0. 45 Ma, may reflect the decoupling of the Calabrian block with respect to Adria and Sicily, allowing further advancing of the Calabrian arc in the Ionian area, where subduction could continue until the present time. The lower part of the succession (the H. sellii and "large Gephyrocapsa" Zones, from ca. 1. 67 to ca. 1. 23 Ma) consists of slope to outer-shelf monotonous mudstones and is bounded at the top by the first unconformity, whose gap suppresses the upper part of to locally the entire "large Gephyrocapsa" Zone (1. 608 - 1. 235 Ma) and {{the lower part of the}} "small Gephyrocapsa" Zone (1. 235 - 0. 96 Ma). A number of cyc 10 thems developed in an outer- to innershelf environment within the "small Gephyrocapsa" Zone. Biomagnetostratigraphic constraints strongly support a correlation between the condensed sections of cyclothems and MIS (marine isotope stage) 33 to MIS 25. From the base of the P. lacunosa Zone (at ca. 0. 96 Ma) upward, the succession rapidly becomes sand dominated, a change that can be confidently correlated with the major climatic shift associated with MIS 24 to MIS 22. In the following succession, two tephra layers, named "Pitagora ash" and "Parmenide ash," provide mappable isochronous surfaces across the subbasin. The sedimentary record is remarkably cyclothemic, characterized by a stack of simple or composite, seaward-prograding, sanddominated tongues and intervening aggradational deposits related to transgressivedeepening episodes. The cyclothems can be confidently correlated with the oxygen isotope record up to the Matuyama-Brunhes inversion, i. e., up to MIS 19, whereas the stratigraphic record postdating MIS 19 has poorer chronological constraints. Dating is provided by tracing the Parmenide ash in the deeper-water coeval succession of the southern part of the Crotone basin, where the deposits including the ash can be correlated by means of nannofossil biostratigraphy with termination V (transition from MIS 12 to MIS 11). The second unconformity marks an abrupt increase in the proximal character of the sedimentary deposits forming the cyclothems, which incorporate increasing amounts of marginal-marine to continental deposits in the upper part of the sub basin infill. Several lines of direct and indirect evidence indicate that, in spite of the dramatic role of tectonics in shaping stratigraphic architecture, the roles of tectonics and eustasy can be disentangled, owing to the different time scales of the tectonic events and the high-frequency, high-amplitude glacioeustatic Pleistocene cycles. Interaction between intrabasinal tectonics and high rates of sediment supply allowed forced regressive and possibly also lowstand systems tracts to be preserved in some cyclothems, particularly in the lower part of the succession, an unusual fact in shelf deposits. Considering the far younger age of marine terraces on the Ionian'side of Calabria when compared to the Tyrrhenian side, it is thought that, during ongoing subduction of the Ionian crust, a wave of uplift and related extensional tectonics migrated southeastward in the rear of the frontal accretionary wedge...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a 200 m-thick {{section of the}} Pisco Formation exposed at Cerro Colorado, an important fossiliferous site in the Ica desert. In order to properly place the fauna in its correct relative position, this study establishes the stratigraphic framework within which the different fossil-bearing intervals of this site can be compared and may prove invaluable in future high-resolution studies on the faunal change. Most of the Pisco Formation deposits exposed at Cerro Colorado consist of gently dipping fine-grained sandstones, diatomaceous siltstones and diatomites with minor ash layers and dolomites deposited within nearshore and offshore settings. To facilitate detailed stratigraphic correlations within the Pisco strata for a 30 km 2 area, eight marker beds have been defined and large-scale (1 : 10, 000 scale) geological mapping conducted to determine fault positions, styles and offsets. The geological map shows {{that there are two}} important angular unconformities in the study area.

40|$|In the Styrian Basin, early Miocene marine {{sedimentation}} of the Karpatian (upper Burdigalian) {{ended with}} basin shallowing, marked regression and tectonic movements. The Karpatian sedimentation cycle {{corresponds to the}} global 3 rd order cycle TB 2. 2, followed by the Bur 5 /Lan 1 sea-level fall. This regression was combined with tectonic movements (the Styrian Tectonic Phase), seen in the Styrian Unconformity by an <b>angular</b> <b>discordance</b> at the Wagna and Katzengraben outcrops and also in deep wells. Sediments of the first middle Miocene (Badenian/Langhian) transgression are commonly eroded or reduced in thickness at the basin borders. In the basin center, the bathyal environment continues from the Karpatian to the Badenian. Sediments of the first Badenian transgression have been dated by calcareous nannoplankton as NN 4 and correlated by the occurrence of Praeorbulina sicana with the basal Langhian. The 3 rd order sequence corresponds to TB 2. 3. The erosional phase of the sea-level fall Lan 2 /Ser 1 can only be observed in near-shore facies, followed by transgressive beds within Zone NN 5, which represents the second, main Badenian transgression in the Central Paratethys and corresponds to the long global cycle TB 2.

40|$|We {{processed}} and interpreted a newly acquired geophysical dataset (WS 10 project) integrated with vintage seismic profiles {{to study the}} evolution of the Sardinian passive margin of the Sardo-Provençal basin. The most prominent features of the area of study are a consequence of the Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC) which produced a thick salt layer in the deep basin. Complex halokinetic tectonics deformed the overlying Messinian Upper Unit (UU) and the Pliocene–Quaternary (PQ) sediments, sometimes also bending the sea bottom. A thinner autochthonous salt in the UU suggests at least one further low stand during the late MSC. The Messinian Erosional Surface (MES) separates the erosional truncation of the pre-Messinian sedimentary sequence from the overlaying Plio-Pleistocene sequence with a clear <b>angular</b> <b>discordance,</b> which almost completely masks possible earlier erosional events. The MES is present across the middle and upper slopes of the Sardinian margin and can be easily recognized down to the lower slope, where it interfingers with the Messinian evaporites which gradually thicken basinward. We propose a correlation between the main erosional surface of the lower slope and the salt layer recognized in the UU as a consequence of a falling stage during {{the last part of the}} MSC. The seismic profiles now available along the West Sardinian margin provide novel and crucial information to correlate the Messinian depositional units in the deep basin with those present in the lower continental slope and with the erosional surface of the middle and upper slopes.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} Torlesse-like rocks and overlying Motuan, Urutawan (Albian) rocks {{in the area around}} Mt. Lookout, central Marlborough. Previous geologists working in Marlborough have supported either a regional unconformity separating Torlesse-like from overlying rocks (e. g. Gair 1967, Laird 1980) or continuous sedimentation between Torlesse-like and overlying rocks (e. g. Wellman 1959, Lensen 1962). Torlesse-like rocks (the Tone Fm) form the stratigraphic basement in the area and are thought to be Lower Cretaceous in age. Six Clarence aged units overlap unconformably onto the Torlesse-like basement and are incised into each other with local <b>angular</b> <b>discordance.</b> The Totara Fm (Urutawan?), the Gladstone Fm (Motuan), the Lower Winterton Fm (Motuan), the Upper Winterton Fm (Motuan), and the Castle Creek Conglomerate are a series of discrete sedimentary cycles three of which clearly show a fining upwards pattern from conglomerates and sandstones to massive mudstone. The composition, lithology, metamorphic rank, and structure of all units of Motuan or older age were studied and compared. The results from this analysis show that the overlying Motuan-Urutawan rocks are lithologically, depositionally, compositionally, and metamorphically similar to the underlying Torlesse-like rocks and that at no horizon is there a radical change. Although there was a clear structural break between Torlesse-like and Motuan rocks in the George River, the structural distinction of Torlesse and post Torlesse rocks in the Winterton River is subtle. These results suggest that both the Torlesse-like and the overlying Urutawan-Motuan strata represent sedimentation during the Rangitata Orogeny and that the change from Rangitata to post Rangitata conditions was evolutionary and cannot be fixed to a specific time...|$|E
40|$|A thick, largely shallow marine {{succession}} of Cretaceous and Lower Tertiary strata, {{deposited in the}} James Ross Basin, is well exposed on an archipelago of islands at {{the northern end of}} the Antarctic Peninsula. This succession was thought to be relatively continuous, particularly on Seymour Island where a thick Upper Cretaceous succession passes up into Paleocene and Eocene strata. Several unconformities present in the succession were thought to be relatively minor and have been ascribed to sea level changes. Equivalent sedimentary deposits of the López de Bertodano and La Meseta formations, Campanian/Maastrichtian and Lower Eocene respectively, are exposed on Cockburn Island, less than 10 km from Seymour Island. The contact between the two units is an unconformity with an <b>angular</b> <b>discordance</b> varying from 20 ° to 55 °. Rotation of the López de Bertodano Formation corresponds with syn-sedimentary disruption elsewhere in the basin throughout the Late Cretaceous and points to persistent instability. The ages of the strata {{on either side of the}} uncorformity have been dated on the palynological content of five samples and correlation with the Seymour Island succession suggests that at least 900 m of Cretaceous (650 m) and Lower Tertiary (250 m) strata are missing from, or were not deposited at, Cockburn Island. Reworked Maastrichtian palynomorphs in a breccia bed within the La Meseta Formation confirm that Upper Cretaceous strata were eroded although there is no evidence for reworking of Paleocene sediments. We conclude that Cockburn Island includes a continuation of the Eocene unconformity of Seymour Island, extending the trend for the base of the La Meseta Formation to onlap onto progressively older strata. This unconformity may mark a major phase of basin inversion, with tilting and uplift possibly affecting much of the James Ross Basin at this time...|$|E

The conglomerates contain provenance information that identifies a pre-Oligocene depositional history obscured by the unconformable juxtaposition of these Tertiary and Mesozoic strata. Most clasts in the lower Torehina Formation are visually similar to local bedrock lithologies, including metamorphosed sandstones and argillites, but are kaolinitic and contain more detrital and authigenic chert, quartz, and potash feldspar. Local derivation of these clasts seems unlikely. By comparing geochemical ratios with those defined for continental margin sandstones, and well characterised New Zealand tectonic terranes, we interpret the majority of clasts in the lower Torehina Formation to have been derived from a dissected orogen, with mixtures of felsic and volcanogenic-derived sediment. The most likely sources are the Waipapa and Torlesse Terranes. The remaining 20 – 30 % of the clasts in the lower Torehina Formation were originally friable, are coarse grained, and appear to be lithologically exotic relative to known metamorphosed sandstones in basement terrane sources on North Island. Some clasts contain coal laminae and particles, and all contain detrital kaolinite as lithic fragments and matrix. Such characteristics imply a non-marine to marginal-marine source containing sediment derived from strongly weathered granite or granodiorite. Mechanical fragility implies a likely proximal, easily erodible source. We propose that this group of clasts was derived from an Upper Cretaceous sedimentary cover, either part of a locally developed basin fill or part of a once regionally extensive cover on North Island. Either case defines a more widely distributed Cretaceous source than found today...|$|E

Acoustic basement on the Mendeleev Ridge is covered by a ~ 0. 6 – 0. 8 s thick sediment drape over highs and up to 1. 8 s within grabens. A pronounced <b>angular</b> <b>discordance</b> at 0. 18 – 0. 23 s below the seafloor along the middle to upper slopes divides the succession into an upper, undisturbed, uniformly thick, hemipelagic drape (Unit M 1) and a partially truncated lower unit (Unit M 2) characterized by strong reflection bands. Unit M 2 is thicker in intra-ridge grabens and includes three sub-units with abundant debris flows in the uppermost subunit (M 2 a). The discordance between Units M 1 and M 2 most likely relates to instability along the middle to upper slopes and mass wasting, triggered by tectonic activity. The scars were further smoothed by bottom current erosion. We observe comparable acoustic stratigraphy and discordant relationships on the investigated northwestern part of Alpha Ridge. Similarly, on the central Lomonosov Ridge, Paleocene and younger sediments sampled by scientific drilling include an uppermost ~ 0. 2 s thick drape overlying, highly reflective deposits with an angular unconformity confined to the upper slope {{on both sides of the}} ridge. Sediment instability on the three main ridges was most likely generated by a brief phase of tectonic activity (~ 14. 5 – 22 Ma), coinciding with enhanced bottom circulation. These events are coeval with the initial opening of the Fram Strait. The age of the oldest sediments above acoustic basement on the Mendeleev- and west-central Alpha Ridges is estimated to be 70 – 75 Ma...|$|E
40|$|A revised stratigraphic {{framework}} for the Messinian succession of Cyprus is proposed demonstrating that the three-stage model for the Messinian salinity crisis recently established for the Western Mediterranean also applies to the Eastern Mediterranean, at least for its marginal basins. This analysis {{is based on a}} multidisciplinary study of the Messinian evaporites and associated deposits exposed in the Polemi, Pissouri, Maroni/Psematismenos and Mesaoria basins. Here, we document {{for the first time that}} the base of the unit usually referred to the 'Lower Evaporites' in Cyprus does not actually correspond to the onset of the Messinian salinity crisis. The basal surface of this unit rather corresponds to a regional-scale unconformity, locally associated with an <b>angular</b> <b>discordance,</b> and is related to the erosion and resedimentation of primary evaporites deposited during the first stage of the Messinian salinity crisis. This evidence suggests that the 'Lower Evaporites' of the southern basins of Cyprus actually belong to the second stage of the Messinian salinity crisis; they can be thus ascribed to the Resedimented Lower Gypsum unit that was deposited between 5. 6 and 5. 5  Ma and is possibly coeval to the halite deposited in the northern Mesaoria basin. Primary, in situ evaporites of the first stage of the Messinian salinity crisis were not preserved in Cyprus basins. Conversely, shallow-water primary evaporites deposited during the third stage of the Messinian salinity crisis are well preserved; these deposits can be regarded as the equivalent of the Upper Gypsum of Sicily. Our study documents that the Messinian stratigraphy shows many similarities between the Western and Eastern Mediterranean marginal basins, implying a common and likely coeval development of the Messinian salinity crisis. This could be reflected also in intermediate and deep-water basins; we infer that the Lower Evaporites seismic unit in the deep Eastern Mediterranean basins could well be mainly composed of clastic evaporites and that its base could correspond to the Messinian erosional surface...|$|E

Movements responsible for the <b>angular</b> <b>discordance</b> are inferred to have been dominantly vertical and responsible for steep tilting of the Cambrian sequences and considerable uplift of the Tyennan Geanticline, which became the source area for the sediments immediately overlying the unconformity. The quartzose clastics were mainly deposited in terrestrial alluvial fan environments, although marginal marine sedimentation became progressively more important upwards in the sequence. Intertidal sedimentary environments persisted during deposition of the limestone sequence, but relief of the Precambrian source areas had by early Hiddle Or. dovician time been reduced to such an extent that terrigenous influx was insignificant. Hiddle Devonian deformation of the Palaeozoic rocks, at high crustal levels, produced open, upright, horizontal to gently plunging folds of variable trend. The Tyennan Geanticline behaved as a relatively rigid block during this deformation, which has been correlated with the Tabberabberan Orogeny, of regional importance in southeastern Australia. The structural development now recognized involves a progressive sequence of regional folding on axes which trend east (Dl), northeast (D 2), north (D 3) and northwest to north-northwest (D 4). The last three phases of folding were associated with development of axial plane cleavage in the more ductile lithologies. Localized folding on east-northeast axes and associated cleavage postdates 02, and may have occurred between D 2 and D 3. The relative timing of fold and cleavage development on west-northwest trends in the limestone at Loongana and Gunns Plains is uncertain. Previous conclusions regarding dating of the Tabberabberan deformation may need reconsideration in view of the newly proposed structural sequence.

The Plio-Pleistocene marine lower Saugus Formation is well {{exposed in}} the Santa Susana Mountains north of Simi Valley, California. The lower Saugus is composed mostly of interfingering sandstone, coquinite, and conglomerate deposits, with rare occurrences of intrasparrudite limestone and laminated mudstone. The beds unconformably overlie the Miocene Modelo Formation {{throughout most of}} the study area. The lower Saugus, in the study area, is interpreted to represent a fluvial-dominated delta that is herein named the "Simi Delta". Lithosomes interpreted to be prodelta deposits include clast-supported phosphorite conglomerate and intensely bioturbated, fine to medium sandstone. Delta-front deposits include bedded medium sandstone, serpulid-bearing sandstone, and oyster-pecten coquinites. Distributary-mouth bar deposits are composed of well sorted, parallel-laminated, medium sandstone. Interdistributary bay deposits are composed of poorly sorted, silty, fine sandstone and commonly contain abundant macrofossils. A laminated, lensoidal mudstone, exposed in the Gillibrand Quarry area, is interpreted to represent an abandoned channel which was filled with clay. In Browns Canyon, an <b>angular</b> <b>discordance</b> which is interpreted to represent the transition between topset and foreset beds on a Gilbert-type delta is exposed stable or slightly emergent. This Gilbert-type delta requires a tectonic regime to form. In the Gillibrand Quarry area, where distributary-mouth bar deposits are exposed, a subsiding receiving basin is required. This difference in tectonic regimes suggests that the "Simi Delta" consisted of at least two different delta lobes, which were formed at two different times. Provenance includes an igneous, a high-rank metamorphic, and a reworked sedimentary source. The presence of anorthosite and gneissic clasts indicates that during the Plio-Pleistocene, the San Gabriel Mountain complex was a highland and was shedding these distinctive clasts into the westward-flowing Plio-Pleistocene Santa Clara River which deposited its sediment on the "Simi Delta". Between 1, 000, 000 and 70, 000 years before present, the Santa Susana Mountains were uplifted causing the Pleistocene Santa Clara River to shift to its present course and abandon the "Simi Delta" depositional site...|$|E
40|$|The Pisco Formation is a Mio-Pliocene {{formation}} cropping out for 300 km {{along the}} coast of Peru. This mainly diatomaceous formation is famous worldwide for being a fossil marine vertebrates Lagerstätte. Diatom biostratigraphy was applied to date the Pisco Fm. in few previous works (Macharé et Fourtanier, 1987; Schrader et Ronning, 1988; Koizumi, 1992); those works applied species ranges used in both the Cenozoic middle- to high-latitude North Pacific zonation and Cenozoic low-latitude zonation of Barron, 1985. During recent fieldworks stratigraphic sections at Cerro Colorado and Cerros Los Quesos (Ica desert, Peru), were measured and samples for biostratigraphy were collected ca. every 5 m. Difficulties arose during the biostratigraphic investigations because of the paucity of index species: indeed, coastal and upwelling conditions, which characterized the two sites, lead to the proliferation of species with long stratigraphic ranges such as Odontella aurita, Rhaphoneis spp., Delphineis spp., Coscinodiscus spp., Chaetoceros spp., etc. Results were obtained merging together ranges of species used both in the equatorial Pacific and in the North Tropical Pacific schemes. Cerro Colorado is characterized by an <b>angular</b> <b>discordance</b> that divides it into a lower and an upper allomember (Di Celma et al., 2015). The co-occurrence of the diatom species Denticulopsis hustedtii and Lithodesmium reynoldsii allows the attribution of the lower allomember to the late Miocene, while the only index species present in the upper allomember is Thalassiosira antiqua, which has a stratigraphic range that goes from the late Miocene to the late Pliocene. Thus samples from the upper allomember alone do not permit an accurate dating of the post-discordance sediments. The base of the Cerros Los Quesos sequence is characterized by a younger form of T. antiqua, differring from that of Cerro Colorado by having a more regular central area. Therefore, speculations on the time-relationship between the two sites can be made based on differences in T. antiqua. The presence of many plicated Thalassiosira specimens ascribable to Thalassiosira flexuosa, suggest that Cerros Los Quesos, although younger than Cerro Colorado, is still late Miocene in age...|$|E
40|$|The Mint Canyon {{formation}} (Upper Miocene) {{consists of}} a series of continental sediments including both fanglomerates and fresh-water lake deposits. The basin of deposition of the lake sediments was near the sea but was apparently definitely separated from it. Some 4000 or more feet of sediments have accumulated. The Mint Canyon formation lies nonconformably above the Vasquez formation (Oligocene?). The <b>angular</b> <b>discordance</b> between the Mint Canyon formation and the overlying Modelo (Upper Miocene) is not great but is definite in many places. A series of volcanic tuff beds are present in the Mint Canyon formation. There are at least 8 major tuff beds and possibly as many as 5 minor ones. Individual beds reach a thickness of 10 feet. The tuff, for the most part is a fine grained, acid, vitric tuff, though some crystal fragments are present in certain units. Others are contaminated by sand and grit. There is some suggestion that the pryroclastic material has been derived from the Mojave Desert area and is possibly from the same source as the rhyolitic material of the Rosamond formation. The outcrops of the tuff are restricted to two main areas, one on either flank of a broad, westerly-pitching syncline which is the major structural feature of the Mint Canyon area. In each of these areas, local sections of overturning are present. It is believed that these are the surface manifestations of faulting in the basement complex. Faulting is present to a moderate degree. The major faults are probably steep with vertical movement being most important. Plant fossils are preserved in the fine tuffs. The flora indicates a biseasonal distribution of rainfall with possibly slightly greater annual average than at present. The Mint Canyon flora is part of the Mojave floral province. Fine grained units of the tuffs are quarried and used to a limited extent as surfacing material on asphalt shingles and roofing material. ...|$|E
40|$|The upper Tick Canyon area, {{approximately}} seven {{square miles}} in extent, lies between Agua Dulce Canyon and Mint Canyon in the easternmost pelt of the Ventura Basin in southern California. This area was mapped in detail {{on a scale}} of 1000 feet to one inch and the stratigrephic and structural relationships of the exposed rocks were established. The oldest rocks in the area are of highly metamorphosed metasedimentary and metavolcanic types, which are intruded by igneous bodies of presumed pre-Cretaceous age. This crystalline complex is in fault contact with the rocks of the Vasquez series, the oldest unit in a thick section of Tertiary sedimentary and volcanic rocks. The Vasquez series is perhaps Oligocene in age and was deposited under nonmarine conditions in an elongate trough of fault-block origin. The rocks are mainly fine-to coarse- grained elastic sediments. Interlayered with them are basaltic and andesitic flows and shallow intrusive masses, that form with the sediments a total section of about 4500 feet. This section thickens rapidly east of the area mapped. Overlying the Vasquez strata with a distinct angular unconformity is a series of conglomerates and siltstones of the late Lower Miocene Tick Canyon formation. This unit is approximately 900 feet thick, but thins rapidly to the west within the area under consideration. The Upper Miocene Mint Canyon formation, which also consists of nonmarine elastic sedimentary rocks overlies the Tick Canyon formation throughout the area. These two formations probably are separated by an unconformity, along which there may be local <b>angular</b> <b>discordance</b> of a few degrees. Almost flat-lying, Pleistocene stream deposits occur throughout the area at an elevation of several hundred feet above the present, newly alluviated valley bottoms. Some strike-slip faulting with northeasterly trend took place after Mint Canyon time, perhaps during the Pliocene epoch. This {{may be related to the}} San Andreas fault, which lies ten miles to the northeast. All folds and faults that involve the sedimentary beds probably can be related to adjustments taking place in the underlying crystalline rocks. The forces causing these adjustments probably were active throughout much of Tertiary and Quaternary time, and activities do not appear to have ceased as yet. ...|$|E
40|$|Integration of {{data from}} fully cored stratigraphic holes with an {{extensive}} grid of seismic reflection lines in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, has allowed the formulation of a new model {{for the evolution of}} the Cenozoic Victoria Land Basin of the West Antarctic Rift. The Early Rift phase (Eocene to Early Oligocene) is recorded by wedges of strata confined by early extensional faults, and which contain seismic facies consistent with drainage via coarse-grained fans and deltas into discrete, actively subsiding grabens and half-grabens. The Main Rift phase (Early Oligocene to Early Miocene) is represented by a lens of strata that thickens symmetrically from the basin margins into a central depocenter, and in which stratal events pass continuously {{over the top of the}} Early Rift extensional topography. Internal seismic facies and lithofacies indicate a more organized, cyclical shallow marine succession, influenced increasingly upward by cycles of glacial advance and retreat into the basin. The Passive Thermal Subsidence phase (Early Middle Miocene) is recorded by an evenly distributed sheet of strata that thickens somewhat into the depocenter but is continuous across and over the earlier rift strata to the margins of the basin. Internally, it contains similar facies to the underlying Main Rift, but preserves more evidence for clinoform sets and large channels, and in core comprises many short, condensed and strongly top-truncated stratal cycles with continued, periodic glacial influence. These patterns are interpreted to record accumulation under similar environmental conditions but in a regime of slower subsidence. The Renewed Rifting phase (Middle Miocene to Recent, largely unsampled by coring thus far) is represented by intervals that thicken significantly into the basin depocenter and that are complicated by evidence of magmatic activity (Mc- Murdo Volcanic Group). This succession is further divided into lower and upper intervals, separated by a major unconformity that displays increasing <b>angular</b> <b>discordance</b> towards the western basin margin and Transantarctic Mountain Front. The youngest part of the stratigraphy was accumulated under the influence of flexural loading imposed by the construction of large volcanic edifices, and was formed in an environment in which little sediment was supplied from the western basin margin, suggesting a change in environmental (glacial) conditions at possibly c. 2 Ma. The Cenozoic stratigraphy of the southern Victoria Land Basin preserves archives of both climate change and the complex rift history of the basin, and coincidences between key stratal surfaces in seismic data and evidence for environmental change in drillcores suggest that tectonic and climatic drivers may be causally linked...|$|E
40|$|The Olds Ferry terrane of the Blue Mountains {{province}} {{is one of}} {{the numerous}} accreted terranes that comprise the western North American Cordillera. The Blue Mountains province is located in central and eastern Oregon, western Idaho, and extreme southeastern Washington, and is a crucial link in reconstructions of the North American Cordillera due to its position in an area with few visible terranes between the more extensively exposed terranes to the south in California and Nevada and to the north in Canada and Alaska. New field evidence and U-Pb zircon geochronology for volcanics within the sedimentary onlap assemblages overlying the Wallowa and Olds Ferry volcanic arc terranes provide evidence for an earlier connection between the terranes than has previously been recognized. The boundary between the Izee and Olds Ferry strata is an angular unconformity based on geochronological data, the consistent <b>angular</b> <b>discordance</b> between the Olds Ferry and Izee strata, and the presence of locally derived volcanic and plutonic clasts of the Olds Ferry arc in the basal Weatherby conglomerate of the Izee terrane. I correlate this unconformity with that present {{at the base of the}} transgressive fluvial-deltaic and marine sequence of the Coon Hollow Formation of the Wallowa terrane based on new ages from units bracketing this unconformity. Ages for the basal Coon Hollow and Weatherby Formations allow these to be correlative sedimentary onlap packages and thus demonstrate the connection between the Wallowa and Olds Ferry terranes by Early Jurassic time. Detailed field mapping and geochronology was used to split the Huntington Formation into two members, and establish their relationships to underlying plutonic rocks and the overlying sediments of the Izee basin onlap sequence. Geochemical data support splitting the Huntington Formation into two members, and support a model of eruption in an island-arc environment with a combination of mantle and crustal magma sources distinct from the island arc that is the Wallowa terrane. Geochronologic and structural constraints also provide evidence that Olds Ferry volcanism continued well into the Early Jurassic, and that the lower and upper members of the Huntington Formation are separated by an angular unconformity and rest with nonconformity on the underlying plutonic units. Precambrian xenocrystic zircons in lower and upper Huntington Formation volcanics indicate that the Olds Ferry terrane was proximal to cratonal North America during much of its history. Age correlations made possible by new U-Pb geochronology indicate that the Olds Ferry and Wallowa arcs may have been active concurrently in the early Late Triassic, followed by a period in the Late Triassic when the Olds Ferry arc was volcanically active while the Wallowa arc was quiescent...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1976 Seven {{formations}} of the Upper Cretaceous Nanaimo Group {{sedimentary rocks}} are exposed on Saturna and Tumbo Islands. These formations are, from oldest to youngest, the Extension-Protection, Cedar District, DeCourcy, Northumberland, Geoffrey, Spray, and Gabriola. The rocks represent four successive cycles of deltaic sedimentation, {{the oldest and}} the youngest of which are incompletely exposed in the thesis area. A composite section of maximum thickneis for the formations exposed on Saturna and Tumbo Islands is 9, 776 feet; however, the formations vary significantly in thickness along strike. The Extension-Protection Formation, consisting of conglomerates and lithic wackes, represents {{the upper part of}} a delta complex. The lower part of the cycle is not exposed in the thesis area. The conglomerates are interpreted as having been deposited in the bed load and point bar subenvironments of highly competent streams. The sandstones overlying the conglomerates are interpreted as marine topset sands. The Cedar District Formation, {{the lower part of the}} Cedar District-DeCourcy deltaic cycle, overlies the Extension-Protection Formation with an <b>angular</b> <b>discordance</b> of about 50. The Cedar District Formation consists of repetitively interbedded and normally graded sandstones, siltstones, and mudstones, which were probably deposited as turbidites. The Cedar District strata are interpreted as delta-slope deposits. Conformably overlying and intertonguing with the Cedar District Formation are the channel-mouth bar arkosic and lithic wackes of the DeCourcy Formation. Distributary channel conglomerates overlie the marine sandstones which are in turn overlain by marine channelmouth bar sandstones. Pa leocurrent data indicate that the Cedar District-DeCourcy deltaic complex prograded in an east-southeasterly direction. The Northumberland Formation, the lower part of the Northumberland-Geoffrey deltaic cycle, conconformably overlies the DeCourcy Formation. Most of the Northumberland Formation was deposited as prodelta mudstones. However, the lower and upper parts of the formation were deposited in delta-slope environments, indicating a transition from and to the marine sandstones of the DeCourcy and Geoffrey Formations, respectively. The Geoffrey Formation intertongues with the Northumberland Formation and consists almost entirely of channel-mouth bar sandstones with local distributary channel conglomerates. The source of the sediments for the Northumberland-Geoffrey deltaic cycle was to the west or northwest. Paleocurrent data indicate that the sandstones of the Geoffrey Formation were distributed in a north to south direction around the mouths of distributary channels by longshore currents. Overlying and intertonguing with the Geoffrey Formation is the predominantly mudstone Spray Formation, most of which is not exposed in the thesis area. The Spray Formation was deposited as turbidites and/or seasonal flood deposits in a delta-slope environment. Overlying and intertonguing with the Spray Formation is the Gabriola Formation, the youngest formation exposed in the thesis area. The Gabriola Formation consists of bed load and point bar fluvial conglomerates, marine channel-mouth bar arkosic and lithic arenites, and topset conglomerates. Lithologies of the sandstones, pebble counts of the conglomerates, and sedimentary structures indicate a paleocurrent dispersal direction to the east or northeast for the Spray-Gabriola deltaic cycle. At least two major episodes of structural deformation have been recorded on Saturna Island. The first episode of structural deformations resulted in a series of north-south trending faults. The second episode of structural deformation resulted in a series of east-west trending faults and related folds (the Kulleet Syncline) ...|$|E
40|$|The Upper Las Liajas Canyon Area, California is {{some six}} and {{one-half}} {{miles long and}} three and one-half miles wide. It is situated five to twelve miles north-west {{of the town of}} Chatsworth. It gives a representative picture of the geology of the California Coast Ranges. The main Santa Susana Range here trends almost due west. It is cut by steep-sided, youthful canyons which generally produce a relief of some five hundred feet. The highest point in the area is 3741 feet in elevation; the greatest relief, however, is not over 2500 feet. The dominant rocks are, east-west striking, faulted and folded sediments of Tertiary age; some late Mesozoic and Quaternary sediments also appear. The oldest rocks in the area, a series of sandstones and intercalated shales, comprise a part of the Chico formation. The portion mapped attains a thickness of more than 750 feet. Apparently unconformably above the Cretaceous lies a section of 350 feet of very coarse massive ferruginous conglomerates of lower Eocene Martinez age. The Martinez seems to grade into the middle Eocene Llajas formation. The Llajas consists of a series of fossiliferous shales, silts, sandstones, and black limestones which crop out over {{a large portion of the}} area south of the Santa Susana thrust zone. In the western portion of the area the Sespe formation appears and is composed of variegated sands and silts, possibly varying in age from upper Eocene to lower Miocene. The Sespe lies disconformably on the Llajas formation and wedges out to the east. Sediments, ranging in age from Pliocene to middle Miocene, overlie the middle Eocene with pronounced angular unconformity. Of these, the lowermost formation, the Topanga, consists of a basal fossiliferous conglomerate some 50 feet thick overlain by 100 feet of fossiliferous sandy silts. The uppermost member of the Topanga is a zone of silt from 25 to 100 feet thick characterized by the foraminifera species, Valvulineria calitornica Cushman. The upper Modelo diatmites overlie this zone in places with possible slight <b>angular</b> <b>discordance.</b> The average thickness of the Modelo is 200 feet. North of the Santa Susana fault zone, a thick series of upper Miocene shales, sandstones, and grits, which have apparently been pushed into the area by overthrusting, crop out. In most localities above the Modelo diatomite, and generally in unconformable relationship with it, are a series of fossiliferous sandy silts some 250 feet thick and of lower middle Pliocene Pico age. Unconformably above the Pico lie upper middle Pliocene sediments which become nonmarine upward in the section and grade into the Pleistocene (?) Saugus sands and gravels. The whole series exposed here is over 1150 feet thick. At least two ages of alluvial deposits were mapped. The main structural feature in the area is the northward-dipping Santa Susana thrust fault which became active in the Pleistocene epoch. The thrust zone itself is, as the name implies, not one clean-cut fault but a zone of roughly parallel faults forming a somewhat braided pattern. Most of the faults are rather steep-angled, northward dips from 30 to 70 degrees being recorded and the average being around 50 degrees. The total displacement of this zone is not known but is at least several thousand feet. The strata along the front of the overthrust block are in many places overturned. Numerous strike-slip faults, trending normal to the strike of the Santa Susana thrust zone appear to have offset the structures in the block itself and also those in front of the overthrust mass including the Quaternary alluvial deposits in places as much as 3000 feet. The area to the south of the Santa Susana fault zone is faulted and folded but not to the degree of the region to the north. The topographic features suggest that the region owes most of its present relief to uplift by faulting and folding in the Pleistocene epoch. The presence of terraces and inner gorges in several of the main canyons as well as the courses of the main streams indicates an erosional history that is far from simple. The relatively older topography, found south of the overthrust zone, and the younger topography appearing in the overthrust block itself, corroborate the geologic evidence indicating late movement along the Santa Susana thrust zone...|$|E
40|$|The Mont Fort nappe is {{the upper}} tectonic {{subdivision}} {{of the former}} Grand St-Bernard (GSB) nappe (Escher 1988, Escher et al. 1997). Subsequent research has confirmed its tectonic and stratigraphic independence {{from the rest of}} the GSB nappe (e. g. Gouffon 1993). It consists of a Paleozoic basement overlain by a thin Mesozoic sedimentary cover, comprised of very thin, discontinuous Triassic quartzite and dolomite, a thin limestone layer, and for the greater part of breccias of variable thickness mostly made of dolomitic elements (“reconstituted Triassic”). These breccias are overlain by a more massive limestone topped by a thinner upper breccia rich in elements of quartzite. Called by Escher (1988) the Evolène series, this sequence presents remarkable similarities with the stratigraphic column of the Breccia nappe in the Prealps which typically belongs to the Prepiemontese paleogeographic domain (Lemoine 1961, Escher 1988). This similarity strongly suggests an earliest Jurassic age for the lower limestone, a late Early to Middle Jurassic age for the main mass of breccias (Lower Breccia), and a Late Jurassic to earliest Cretacous age for the upper limestone and the Upper Breccia. We will not discuss here the status of the Cretaceous calcschists (Série Rousse, Marthaler 1984) that overlie the Evolène series and are the subject of research in progress. These ages are generally accepted. However, several authors proposed a different tectonic model where the Evolène series would be allochthonous over the Mont Fort basement (e. g. Sartori & Marthaler 1994, Marthaler et al. 2008). Their contact would be an Alpine thrust. The main argument would be that this contact surface often cuts with an <b>angular</b> <b>discordance</b> the stratigraphy of the Evolène series. Consequently, this series would not be the original sedimentary cover of the Mont Fort basement but would belong to a distinct tectonic unit that these authors identified with the Cima Bianca nappe (classically defined as a slice of Late Paleozoic to Mesozoic sediments separating the ophiolitic Zermatt-Saas and Tsaté nappes; Vannay & Allemann 1990, Steck et al. 2015). This proposition has been widely accepted (e. g. Tectonic map of Switzerland 2005). Our observations don’t support this proposition. They rather confirm the tectonic reconstruction of Escher (1988) and suggest that the Evolène series is indeed the autochthonous cover of the Mont Fort basement. The main points are: 	At many places the contact is concordant and shows a good preservation of the basal levels of the Mesozoic sequence, without any hint of tectonic disturbance or anomalous rock deformation. 	The discordance observed at other places, which can put the Jurassic breccia in contact with all older formations, can be conveniently explained by synsedimentary normal paleofaults. By means of strain theory (e. g. Ramsay 1967) it is easy to demonstrate that passive deformation of such faults during Alpine compression can mimic thrusts. 	The sedimentary characteristics of the Evolène series, typicall of the Prepiemontese domain, are very different from those of the Cima Bianca unit, much poorer in breccias and whose relatively thick Triassic formations of quartzite and carbonates show a Briançonnais affinity. Conclusion : The Evolène series is the sedimentary cover of the Mont Fort nappe. During Jurassic times it has been strongly affected by synsedimentary normal faulting, generating stratigraphic gaps, synsedimentary anomalous contacts and internal discordances. These structures provide a spectacular record of the extension of the European margin during the opening of the Alpine Tethys. Then Alpine compression passively deformed these faults in such a way that they mimic Alpine thrusts.

40|$|The 6 th {{map of the}} Coastal Atlas of the Strait of Magellan (1 : 50, 000 scale) {{refers to}} sheets 84 and 101 of the Chilean I. G. M., and was made using the {{preliminary}} cartography by E. NA. P. (Empresa Nacional de Petroleo) and the Chilean I. G. M., aerial photos by S. A. F. (Servicio Aerofotogrammetrico Fuerza Aerea de Chile) and T. M. and M. S. S. Landsat satellite images. 	This research is aimed mainly at locating and mapping the marine and transitional terraces in Patagonia, along the eastern coasts of the Strait of Magellan, between Punta Arenas and Cabo Froward. 	Methodologicaly, we followed both the criteria of several more recent cartographic works produced by Programma Nazionale Ricerche in Antartide (Magellan Project), {{as well as the}} general criteria internationally adopted in coastal geological cartography. 	The coastal cartography of Quaternary deposits in the area south of Punta arenas (Tierra del Fuego - Strait of Magellan - Chile) is part of a wider ongoing research program that started in 1991 on the recent evolution of the Strait of Magellan. To this purpose, within the Programma Nazionale di Ricerche in Antartide (P. N. R. A.) (National Research Programme in Antarctica), 3 campaigns were carried out on land. The first was in 1991 and dealt with the sedimentology and geology of coastal Pleisto-Holocene deposits, while the second and the third, in 1994 and 2003 that is after the cartographic and geomorphological data had been processed, were intended as a check of the cartography of the old coastlines and postglacial, Quaternary, prevalently marine deposits. 	Moreover, the study also involves the the project RAS-PVS (Regione Autonoma Sardegna - Paesi in Via di Sviluppo - Cartografia Geologico - Morfologica delle Coste dello Stretto di Magellano). 	Among the objectives that developed during the research is the publication of an Atlas of the coasts of the Strait of Magellan on geological and geomorphological elements, prevalently Holocenic, that can be useful to formulate an evolutionary hypothesis of the Strait in very recent times. The Atlas is at present being refined while its publication depends exclusively on the obtaining of funds to print the maps in colour. 	The Atlas is configured not only as a theme cartography of the evolutionary characteristics of the Late Pleistocene-Holocene sea, but also as a cartographic document of geomorphologic and evolutionary elements of the continental and transitional deposits underlying the marine deposits. Three thematic general maps at the 1 : 200, 000 scale on the eastern region of the Strait of Magellan have already been published (Brambati et Al., 1995 a; De Muro et Al, 1995; Di Grande et Al., 1995). Marine and transitional deposits. 	Marine and transitional deposits and forms regularly occupy the coastal belt from Punta Arenas to Cabo Foward. They are mainly represented by gravel, sand and silt deposits, or more rarely, by simple erosion surfaces. 	Four main orders of terraced sequences have been mapped. 	The first, and oldest, was found regularly between altitudes of 18 and 25 meters. Sand and silt deposits prevail here. Because of its stratigraphic position and by radiocarbon dating this first order was referred to the Lower Holocene without the exclusion that its base may belong to the Upper Pleistocene, while the depositional environment is transitional. 	The Second Order, is distributed between 6 and 11 metres, and is mainly represented by fossiliferous gravel deposits; sands and silts are also present. It regularly covers most of the coastal stretch and extends in the backland {{at the level of the}} main fluvial and lacustrine depressions. At times, it presents well-preserved complex sedimentary structures of paleobeach environments (berms, spits and/or bars). The age of formation of the marine deposit, by C 14 dating, is on average between 6,OOO and 7,OOO years B. P. 	The Third Order strictly follows the present beach, between altitudes of 3 and 5 metres, at the foot of the Second Order terrace. It is made up of gravels and sands and refers preferably to a marine environment. 	At a slightly lower elevation, presence of small, terraced (Fourth order), marine remnants, younger than in the Third Order, was rarely noticed. Conclusion 	The 6 th map of the Coastal Atlas of the Strait of Magellan provides a zoning of the area distribution of the most significant deposits, forms and processes relating to the coastal belt between Punta Arenas and Rio Quema Angusta - Peninsula Brunswick. 	From the Map it can be seen that the morphogenesis of the area was strictly controlled by the processes associated with the advance and retreat of the Magellan Glacier, and subordinately, by the main morphodynamic event represented by post deglaciation marine ingression. 	The Holocene paleogeographic evolutionary picture of the Patagonia-Tierra del Fuego area, is mainly controlled by the imposing phenomenon of glacio-isostasy, though it cannot be ruled out that the morphogenesis subsequent to deglaciation may have been affected by mild neo-tectonic movements. 	As previously observed (DeMuro et Al., 1995 b), marine ingressions that produced terracing of the coasts and backland presumably depend on prevalently positive movements of the whole coastal system, related to the final deglaciation of the region. 	It is deduced that parallelly following deglaciation, a strong parallel uplift of the mean sea level was produced with initially transgressive stratigraphic effects. Isostatic rebound, that probably occurred rather late compared to post-glacial transgression, is superimposed with very complex and articulate phenomena, that are under study at present and will be the subject of future works. 	From an examination of map n. 6 / 12 of the Atlas of the coasts of the Strait of Magellan, it emerges that all marine and transitional terraces that have been found are later than the last glaciation, and are superimposed on its products with clear <b>angular</b> <b>discordance</b> and sharp erosive truncation.

To summarize the main geological features and evolutionary characteristics of both islands we emphasize the following stages of development: During the Pliocene, a submarine volcanic edifice or seamount formed in the island of La Palma, made up of pillow lavas, pillow breccias and hyaloclastites, intruded by trachytic domes, plugs of gabbros, and a highly dense dyke swarm. The intense magmatic and dyke intrusion uplifted the searnount up to 1, 500 m, tilting it 45 - 50 " to the SW. This intrusive phase was followed by a period of quiescence and erosion of the emerged submarine edifice. The definitive consolidation and progression of the construction of the island continued from at least 1. 77 ma in angular and erosive discordance over the submarine basement. The subaerial volcanic reactivation, in which explosive volcanism predominated during the initial stages, producing abundant volcanoclastic and phreatomagmatic materials at the base of the subaerial edifice, persisted in a highly continuous manner until at least 0. 41 ma. This initial subaerial stage shaped the northern volcanic shield, formed by the accumulation of several superimposed volcanoes, approximately concentric in relation to one another and the submarine basement. The initial stage of the northern volcanic shield lasted between 1. 77 and 1. 20 ma, during which period the Garaf&# 237;a volcano was built to a height of 2, 500 - 3, 000 m, with steeply sloping flanks, formed predominantly by alkaline basalts with abundant pahoehoe lavas. The rapid growth and progressive instability of the Garaf&# 237;a volcano culminated some 1. 20 ma ago in a gravitational landslide of the south flank of the volcanic edifice. The eruptive activity that followed the collapse built the Taburiente volcano, that rests upon a clear <b>angular</b> <b>discordance</b> caused by the landslide. The landslide depression was filled completely some 0. 89 ma ago, as shown by the age of the first lavas to overflow the collapse embayment. The filling-in of the depression by the Taburiente volcano lavas finally formed a sequence of horizontal lavas, predominantly alkaline basalts, that ponded against the headwall of the landslide scarp fonning a plateau in the centre of the volcanic shield. Coinciding approximately with the Matuyama-Brunhes boundary (0. 78 ma) an important reorganisation of the Taburiente volcano took place, the dispersed emission centres of which progressively concentrated in three increasingly defined rifts (NW, NE and N-S) and subsequently in a central edifice situated at the geometrical centre of the volcanic shield. The abundant emissions of this final stage covered the earlier formations with sequences of lava flows up to 1, 000 m thick in places, with the exception of a part of the alignments of cones of the rifts. The basaltic lavas evolved towards more differentiated phonolitic and trachytic terms at the terminal phases of construction of the volcano. One of these rifts, the southern or Cumbre Nueva rift, developed more than the others, possibly because the volcanism already began to migrate southwards, forming a N-S trending dorsal ridge over 2, 500 m high. The progressive instability of the Cumbre Nueva rift, due to overgrowth, triggered the gravitational landslide of the western flank, in a process that took place about 560 ka ago, involving the detachment of some 180 - 200 km 3 and the formation of a wide depression (the Valle de Aridane) and the beginning of the formation, by incision and retrogressive erosion, of the Caldera de Taburiente. The activity subsequent to the collapse in the northern shield was preferentially concentrated in the interior of the new collapse basin, quickly building the Bejenado stratovolcano. This activity was coetaneous with that of other residual centres dispersed over the flanks of the shield. The initially basanite lavas of Bejenado volcano evolved to mafic tephrites in differentiated lateral and terminal vents. The activity of the volcanic shield ceased definitively some 0. 4 ma ago. After a transition period with a certain degree of activity associated with Bejenado late peripheral vents, volcanism was definitively located until the present in the new Cumbre Vieja volcano, at the south of the island. The oldest Cumbre Vieja lavas have been dated in 123 ka, although the first eruptions of the volcano may be considerably older. During this last stage of volcanism in La Palma a N-S trending rift has been formed, with predominantly basanitic, tephritic and tephri-phonolitic lavas, and intrusions of domes of tephri-phonolites and phonolites, frequently associated with eruptive vents. Numerous submarine eruptive vents, severa 1 of which are apparently very recent, have recently been observed and sampled at the prolongation of the Cumbre Vieja rift southwards in the ocean. The foreseeable geological evolution of this rift is similar to that of its Cumbre Nueva predecesor, towards a progressive development and increasing instability, although changes may take place that may modify it towards more stable configurations, fundamentally the submarine progression of the southern tip of the rift, that could redistribute the volume of emitted materials, reduce the aspect ratio of the volcano and, consequently, its instability. The en echelon faults generated during the 1949 eruption have been interpreted as a possible detachment of the western flank of the volcano, although a more favourable hypothesis would be that such faults are surficial and contribute to accommodating the volcano by reducing its instability. A noteworthy aspect is the important role played by the mobility of the general feeding system of the volcanism in shaping the form and structure of the island. If the volcanism had not continually migrated southward since the final stages of construction of the northern shield, the island of La Palma would probably have taken on a similar configuration to that of the islands of El Hierro or Tenerife, in the shape of a triangular pyramid, with triple-armed rifts and landslide lobes between the rifts. The southward migration of volcanism in La Palma left the northern shield extinct, the rifts incomplete and finally configured an island lengthened in a N-S direction. Another point of interest is that the islands of La Palma and El Hierro are the first of the Canaries to form simultaneously, with possibly alternating eruptive activity, at least in the most recent period. This separation in a &# 194;&# 171;dual line&# 194;&# 187; of islands and the greater depth of its oceanic basement account for the long time they have required to emerge since the formation of the prior island of La Gomera. The island of El Hierro is geologically somewhat younger than La Palma and, because it formed over a stationary source of magma, it presents, in comparison, a perfect, concentric development, with superimposed volcanoes and a regular three-armed rift geometry. The activity of the subaerial volcanism began in El Hierro with the development of Ti&# 241;or volcano on the NE flank of the island (approximately from 1. 12 to 0. 88 ma), with the emission of massive typical basalts. The volcano developed quickly, with different stages of growth, the eruption of Ventej&# 237;s volcano being the terminal explosive stage, and probably the precursor of the collapse of the NW flank of the edifice some 882 ka ago. The emissions of the new volcano -El Golfo, approximately 545 to 176. 000 ka- totally filled the depression of the lateral collapse of Ti&# 241;or volcano, the lava flows of which then spilled over the flanks of the earlier volcano. The beginning of the construction of the El Golfo volcano seems to have taken place after a relatively long period of activity, probably coinciding with the maximum development of the Cumbre Nueva rift on La Palma. The initial subaerial activity at El Golfo was characterised by basaltic lavas that evolved to trachybasalts and trachytes, and finally towards more differentiated eruptive episodes indicative of the terminal state of the volcanic activity of the El Golfo volcano. The excessive growth of this volcano triggered the failure of its north flank, generating the spectacular scarp and present El Golfo depression. Subsequent volcanism, from emission vents arranged in a three-armed rift system (rift volcanism, with ages ranging from 145 ka to 2, 500 years, with probably prehistoric eruptions), implies the much more moderate continuation of the earlier predominantly basanitic-tephritic volcanic activity. This period may correspond to that of maximum development of the Cumbre Vieja rift, in the island of La Palma. Las Canarias occidentales, relativamente poco estudiadas hasta hace unos a&# 241;os desde el punto de vista geol&# 243;gico, han aportado sin embargo datos decisivos para la comprensi&# 243;n de muchos de los problemas geol&# 243;gicos m&# 225;s importantes del archipi&# 233;lago, que posiblemente se hubieran dilucidado m&# 225;s prontamente si su estudio se hubiese comenzado, como en la mayor&# 237;a de las cadenas de islas volc&# 225;nicas oce&# 225;nicas, por su extremo m&# 225;s reciente. Como resumen de sus principales rasgos geol&# 243;gicos evolutivos de ambas islas destacamos las siguientes etapas de desarrollo: Durante el Plioceno se levanta en el extremo occidental del Archipi&# 233;lago, en la isla de La Palma, un edificio o monte submarino constituido por pillow lavas, pillow brechas e hialoclastitas de composici&# 243;n bas&# 225;ltica, intruido por domos traqu&# 237;ticos, plutones de gabros y una dens&# 237;sima red de diques. Por el efecto de la intensa intrusi&# 243;n magm&# 225;tica y filoniana el edificio submarino sufri&# 243; un levantamiento hasta cotas de 1. 500 m y basculamiento de 45 - 50 " al SO, seguido de un per&# 237;odo de quiescencia y erosi&# 243;n del edificio submarino emergido. La consolidaci&# 243;n definitiva y progresi&# 243;n de la construcci&# 243;n de la isla se hace en discordancia angular y erosiva sobre el basamento submarino a partir de al menos unos 1, 77 millones de a&# 241;os. La reactivaci&# 243;n volc&# 225;nica suba&# 233;rea, con predominio de volcanismo explosivo en las fases iniciales con producci&# 243;n de abundantes materiales volcanocl&# 225;sticos y freatomagm&# 225;ticos en la base del edificio suba&# 233;reo, persisti&# 243; de forma muy continua hasta al menos 0, 41 millones de a&# 241;os. Esta fase suba&# 233;rea inicial configura el Escudo Volc&# 225;nico Norte, formado por la superposici&# 243;n de varios edificios volc&# 225;nicos superpuestos y aproximadamente conc&# 233;ntricos entre s&# 237; y con el basamento submarino. El Escudo Volc&# 225;nico Norte tiene una primera etapa, desde 1, 77 a 1, 20 ma, en la que se construye el edificio volc&# 225;nico Garaf&# 237;a, formado por lavas predominantemente bas&# 225;lticas alcalinas poco diferenciadas y abundancia de lavas &# 194;&# 171;pahoe-hoe&# 194;&# 187;, que alcanza una altura de 2. 500 - 3. 000 m, con flancos de acusadas pendientes. El r&# 225;pido crecimiento y progresiva inestabilidad del edificio Garaf&# 237;a culmin&# 243; hace unos 1, 20 millones de a&# 241;os en un deslizamiento gravitatorio del flanco meridional del edificio. La actividad eruptiva que sigui&# 243; al colapso comienza rellenando la depresi&# 243;n de deslizamiento, levantando un nuevo edificio volc&# 225;nico -el edificio volc&# 225;nico Taburiente-, que se apoya sobre una clara discordancia angular producto del deslizamiento. La depresi&# 243;n se rellen&# 243; completamente hace unos 0, 89 ma, edad de las primeras lavas en desbordarla. El relleno de la depresi&# 243;n por las lavas del Taburiente acaba conformando un apilamiento de coladas horizontales -predominantemente basaltos alcalinos- que se remansan contra la cabecera del escarpe de deslizamiento formando una meseta colgada en el centro del escudo volc&# 225;nico. Coincidiendo aproximadamente con el l&# 237;mite Matuyama/Brunhes (0, 78 ma) se produce una importante reorganizaci&# 243;n del edificio volc&# 225;nico Taburiente, cuyos centros de emisi&# 243;n se concentran progresivamente en tres rifts (NO, NE y N-S) cada vez m&# 225;s definidos, y posteriormente en un aparato central situado en el centro geom&# 233;trico del escudo volc&# 225;nico. Las abundantes emisiones de esta etapa final recubren las formaciones anteriores, excepto parte de las alineaciones de conos de los rifts. Las lavas se diferencian hacia t&# 233;rminos fonol&# 237;ticos y traqu&# 237;ticos. El rift meridional (Cumbre Nueva) se desarrolla m&# 225;s que los otros, posiblemente por el comienzo de la migraci&# 243;n hacia el sur del volcanismo, formando una dorsal con m&# 225;s de 2. 500 m de altura y con el eje mayor en direcci&# 243;n N-S. La progresiva inestabilidad del rift de Cumbre Nueva, por un crecimiento excesivo, provoca el deslizamiento gravitatorio del flanco occidental, proceso que ocurri&# 243; hace unos 560 ka y supuso el desgarro de unos 180 - 200 km 3 y la formaci&# 243;n de una amplia depresi&# 243;n (el Valle de Aridane) y el inicio de la formaci&# 243;n -por encajamiento y erosi&# 243;n remontante- de la Caldera de Tabu riente. La actividad posterior al colapso en el escudo norte se concentra preferentemente en el interior de la cuenca de deslizamiento, construyendo r&# 225;pidamente el estratovolc&# 225;n Bejenado. Esta actividad es coet&# 225;nea con la de otros centros residuales y dispersos en los flancos del escudo. Las lavas inicialmente basan&# 237;ticas del edificio Bejenado evolucionaron hacia tefritas m&# 225;ficas en centros laterales y terminales diferenciados. La actividad del escudo volc&# 225;nico termin&# 243; definitivamente hace unos 0, 4 millones de a&# 241;os. Tras un periodo de transici&# 243;n en que hay cierta actividad asociada a centros perif&# 233;ricos del Bejenado, el volcanismo se localiza de forma definitiva y hasta el presente en un nuevo edificio -Cumbre Vieja-, que prolonga la isla hacia el sur. Las lavas m&# 225;s antiguas han sido datadas en 123 Ka, aunque las primeras erupciones del edificio volc&# 225;nico Cumbre Vieja deben ser bastante m&# 225;s antiguas. En esta &# 250;ltima fase del volcanismo de La Palma se ha configurado un rift progresivamente estructurado en la direcci&# 243;n N-S, con lavas predominantemente basan&# 237;ticas, tefritas y tefri-fonolitas, e intrusiones en forma de domos y coladas de tefri-fonolitas y fonolitas, asociados a episodios eruptivos que se contin&# 250;an hasta la actualidad. Recientemente se han observado y muestreado numerosos centros eruptivos submarinos que prolongan el rift de Cumbre Vieja hacia el sur en el oc&# 233;ano, algunos de &# 233;stos aparentemente muy recientes. La previsible evoluci&# 243;n geol&# 243;gica de este rift es similar a la de su antecesor de Cumbre Nueva, hacia un progresivo desarrollo y creciente inestabilidad, aunque pueden originarse cambios que la modifiquen hacia configuraciones m&# 225;s estables, fundamentalmente la progresi&# 243;n submarina del extremo sur del rift, que podr&# 237;a redistribuir el volumen de productos emitidos, rebajar la relaci&# 243;n de aspecto del edificio volc&# 225;nico y, en consecuencia, su inestabilidad. Las fallas escalonadas generadas en la erupci&# 243;n de 1949 han sido interpretadas como un posible desgarre del flanco occidental del edificio volc&# 225;nico, aunque una hip&# 243;tesis m&# 225;s favorable ser&# 237;a la de que tales fallas son superficiales y contribuyen a acomodar el edificio volc&# 225;nico reduciendo su inestabilidad. Un aspecto a destacar es el importante papel que ha jugado la movilidad del sistema general de alimentaci&# 243;n del volcanismo en la forma y estructura de la isla. De no haberse producido una emigraci&# 243;n continua del volcanismo desde las fases finales de construcci&# 243;n del escudo norte, la isla de La Palma posiblemente hubiera adquirido una configuraci&# 243;n similar a la de las islas de El Hierro o Tenerife, con forma de pir&# 225;mide triangular, dorsales tnples y l&# 243;bulos de deslizamiento entre las dorsales. La emigraci&# 243;n del volcanismo hacia el sur en La Palma dej&# 243; el escudo norte extinguido, los rifts inacabados y configur&# 243; finalmente una isla alargada en direcci&# 243;n N-S. Otro interesante aspecto es que las islas de La Palma y El Hierro son las primeras de las Canarias que se est&# 225;n formando de forma simult&# 225;nea, con una posible alternancia de la actividad eruptiva entre ambas islas, al menos en el per&# 237;odo m&# 225;s reciente. Esta &# 194;&# 171;doble&# 194;&# 187; alineaci&# 243;n de islas y la mayor profundidad de su asentamiento explican el largo tiempo que han necesitado para emerger desde la emersi&# 243;n de La Gomera, la anterior isla en formarse. La Isla de El Hierro es geol&# 243;gicamente algo m&# 225;s joven que La Palma y, por haberse formado sobre una fuente magm&# 225;tica estacionaria, ofrece en comparaci&# 243;n un perfecto desarrollo conc&# 233;ntrico, con edificios superpuestos y un sistema regular de dorsales triples. La actividad del volcanismo suba&# 233;reo se inicia en El Hierro con el desarrollo del edificio Ti&# 241;or en la zona NE de la isla desde aproximadamente 1, 12 a 0, 88 Ma, con emisi&# 243;n de t&# 237;picos basaltos masivos poco diferenciados. El edificio se desarrolla r&# 225;pidamente con diferentes estadios de crecimiento, siendo la erupci&# 243;n del centro eruptivo del Ventej&# 237;s del estadio explosivo terminal, probablemente precursor del colapso del flanco NO del edificio volc&# 225;nico hace unos 0, 88 Ma. Las emisiones del nuevo edificio volc&# 225;nico -El Golfo, aproximadamente 545 a 176 Ka- rellenan totalmente la depresi&# 243;n originada por el colapso lateral del edificio Ti&# 241;or, con coladas que acaban vertiendo por los flancos del edificio anterior. El comienzo de la construcci&# 243;n del edificio volc&# 225;nico de El Golfo parece haberse producido tras un periodo relativamente largo de inactividad, probablemente coincidente con el m&# 225;ximo desarrollo del rift de Cumbre Nueva en la isla de La Palma. La actividad suba&# 233;rea inicial de El Golfo se caracteriza por la emisi&# 243;n de lavas bas&# 225;lticas, que evolucionan hacia traquibasaltos y traquitas hacia la parte alta del edificio, y finalmente hacia episodios eruptivos m&# 225;s diferenciados e indicativos del estadio terminal de la actividad volc&# 225;nica del edificio El Golfo. El excesivo crecimiento de este edificio volc&# 225;nico provoc&# 243; el deslizamiento de su flanco norte, generando el espectacular escarpe y depresi&# 243;n actual de El Golfo, proceso que tuvo lugar entre 21 y 133 Ka. El volcanismo posterior, a partir de centros agrupados formando un rift triple (volcanismo de Rift, con edades comprendidas entre los 145 Ka y 2. 500 a&# 241;os, con probables erupciones prehist&# 243;ricas), supone la continuaci&# 243;n, mucho m&# 225;s moderada, de la actividad volc&# 225;nica, predominantemente de basanitas y tefritas. Este periodo de menor actividad eruptiva relativa podr&# 237;a corresponderse con el m&# 225;ximo desarrollo del rift de Cumbre Vieja, en la isla de La Palma...|$|E
