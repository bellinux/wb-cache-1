40|$|The {{effects of}} {{high-pressure}} and heat pretreatments, used prior to drying, on the rehydration rate {{and quality of}} sweet potato was investigated. Sweet potato was pressurized at 200 Mpa for 5 min and heat treatment was performed at 100 °C for 5 min. Three different types of pretreatments were performed: heat <b>treatment,</b> heat <b>treatment</b> <b>after</b> high-pressure <b>treatment</b> and high-pressure <b>treatment</b> <b>after</b> heat <b>treatment.</b> There were no differences in the color parameters (L*, C* and h) and gelatinization rate of rehydrated sweet potato exposed to the three different pretreatments. However, heat <b>treatment</b> <b>after</b> high-pressure <b>treatment</b> resulted in pronounced texture improvement {{compared to the other}} pretreatments. The relative hardness of the rehydrated sweet potato exposed to heat <b>treatment</b> <b>after</b> high-pressure <b>treatment</b> was higher than with the other pretreatments. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} rehydration rate of sweet potato exposed to heat <b>treatment</b> <b>after</b> high-pressure <b>treatment</b> was lower than either heat treatment or high-pressure <b>treatment</b> <b>after</b> heat <b>treatment.</b> Heat <b>treatment</b> <b>after</b> high-pressure <b>treatment</b> prior to drying prevented cubes of sweet potato from collapsing during rehydration. This study shows that in sweet potato, the use of heat <b>treatment</b> <b>after</b> high-pressure <b>treatment</b> prior to drying could serve as an effective method for texture improvement...|$|R

40|$|AIM:To {{explore the}} {{clinical}} effectiveness of sodium aescinate combined with Nd:YAG laser on diabetic macular edema(DME). METHODS:One hundred and sixty-two eyes in 113 DME patients were randomly divided into observation group treated with sodium aescinate combined with 532 nm laser(55 cases with 80 eyes) and control group treated with single Nd:YAG 532 nm laser(58 cases with 82 eyes). Fundus evaluation including {{the thickness of}} macular edema and best corrected visual acuity(BCVA) in all patients were measured by optical coherence tomography(OCT) to analyze the differences before and after treatments(1, 2, 3 and 4 mo). All patients also underwent fundus fluorescein angiography(FFA) before and at 4 mo <b>after</b> <b>treatments.</b> RESULTS:There was no statistical difference on intraocular pressure(IOP),BCVA,CMT {{and the number of}} patient with fluorescence leakage before and <b>after</b> <b>treatments</b> between the two groups(P > 0. 05). IOP before and <b>after</b> <b>treatments</b> had {{no significant differences between the}} two groups(P > 0. 05). The BCVA,CMT and number of patients with fluorescence leakage at 1, 2, 3 and 4 mo <b>after</b> <b>treatments</b> of two groups were better than those before treatments,and the differences were statistical significant(all P P P > 0. 05),The CMT and the number of patients with fluorescence leakage at 1, 2, 3 and 4 mo <b>after</b> <b>treatments</b> of control group were statistical significant by multiple comparison(all P P > 0. 05). The BCVA,CMT and number of patients of fluorescence leakage of observation group at same time <b>after</b> <b>treatments</b> were better than those of control group,and the differences were statistical significant(all P P > 0. 05).

40|$|AIM: To apply optical {{coherence}} tomography(OCT) in {{the detection}} of retinal nerve fiber layer(RNFL) thickness in senile cataract patients and to analyze the changes of RNFL and the correlation with the patient's visual acuity after phacoemulsification. METHODS: Fifty-one senile cataract patients(70 eyes) received the phacoemulsification. The patients were divided into diabetes mellitus(DM) group and non-DM group. There were 30 cases(38 eyes) in non-DM group and 21 cases(32 eyes) in DM group. <b>After</b> <b>treatments,</b> OCT was applied to detect the patients' RNFL thickness at different time periods(at 3, 14 d, 1, 3 and 6 mo <b>after</b> <b>treatments).</b> At different time periods, RNFL thickness was detected to analyze its correlation with the best corrected visual acuity(BCVA). RESULTS: At 3 and 14 d <b>after</b> <b>treatments,</b> RNFL thickness of non-DM group was not {{different from that of}} DM group(P > 0. 05); at 3 and 6 mo <b>after</b> <b>treatments,</b> RNFL thickness of non-DM group was smaller than that of DM group(P P > 0. 05); the uncorrected visual acuity of DM group at 3, 6 mo postoperatively was significantly lower than those of non-DM group(P P P CONCLUSION: OCT is a good detecting parameter for the change of RNFL thickness and the change of RNFL thickness is an important cause of the changes of the patient's visual acuity...|$|R

5|$|In Europe, {{pyrethroids}} and neonicotinoids {{have been}} used against B. rufimanus. Because of the faba bean crop biology and its attraction to pollinators at flowering stage, restrictions on pesticides uses have been introduced in Europe. It is particularly advised to spray in absence of pollinators {{in the early morning}} and evening. In addition, due to B. rufimanus biology, a temperature threshold combined with crop development stage can be used to increase the success of chemical treatments. Adult B. rufimanus activity increases with temperature, so that treatment efficiency might increase when maximum day temperatures are over 20°C during four consecutive days <b>after</b> <b>treatment</b> (Arvalis, 2016). Adult B. rufimanus activity increases with temperature, so that treatment efficiency might increase when maximum day temperatures are over 20°C during four consecutive days <b>after</b> <b>treatment.</b> The end of blooming indicates the end of adult activity in the field. This stage is therefore a threshold marking the end of insecticide application and occurs no later than five days after last blooming. Forecasting systems (Bruchi-LIS, Arvalis, France and BruchidCast, Syngenta, UK) have been developed to optimize insecticide applications based on temperature and crop stage.|$|E
