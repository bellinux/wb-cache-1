5|$|A Balloon Site, Coventry (1942) – shows a team {{of women}} {{hoisting}} a barrage balloon into position with the chimneys of industrial Coventry in the background surrounding the spire of Coventry Cathedral. WAAC commissioned the work as <b>a</b> <b>propaganda</b> tool to recruit women for Balloon Command, and Knight's composition succeeds in making the work appear both heroic and glamorous.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{invasion}} of Khafji was initially <b>a</b> <b>propaganda</b> victory for the Ba'athist Iraqi government, it was swiftly recaptured by Saudi ground forces. The battle serves as a modern demonstration that air power in a supporting role to ground forces can be of great assistance in halting and defeating a major ground operation.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, {{the second}} Congress of FRELIMO was <b>a</b> <b>propaganda</b> {{victory for the}} insurgents, despite {{attempts}} by the Portuguese, who enjoyed air superiority throughout the conflict, to bomb {{the location of the}} meeting late in the day. This gave FRELIMO further weight to wield in the United Nations.|$|E

50|$|Unstated {{assumption}} is <b>a</b> type of <b>propaganda</b> message which forgoes explicitly communicating the propaganda's purpose and instead states ideas derived from it. This technique is used when <b>a</b> <b>propaganda's</b> main idea lacks credibility, and thus when mentioned directly {{will result in}} the audience recognizing its fallacy and nullifying the propaganda.|$|R

5|$|In season 5, Claire's {{story begins}} as {{the opening scene}} of the season: {{shooting}} <b>a</b> <b>propaganda</b> commercial in order to stir up fear. Throughout the beginning, she helps make the campaign's focal point about {{the fear of the}} terrorist Islamic Caliphate Organization (ICO, a fictionalized version of ISIS/ISIL) and how they can stop the threat.|$|E
5|$|With the Italian {{victory at}} Tug Argan, the {{position}} of British forces in Somaliland was compromised, and colonial authorities were forced to initiate a naval evacuation of the garrison form Berbera. As a result, Italy was able to quickly secure British Somaliland, which proved <b>a</b> <b>propaganda</b> coup for Italy {{despite the lack of}} strategic value to the territory.|$|E

5|$|Beecham {{took the}} {{orchestra}} on a controversial tour of Germany in 1936. Throughout the tour, the orchestra ignored {{the custom of}} playing the Nazi anthem before concerts, but Beecham yielded to pressure from Hitler's government not to play the Italian Symphony by Mendelssohn, taboo to Nazi anti-Semites. There was disquiet {{among some of the}} players that their presence in Germany gave the Nazi regime <b>a</b> <b>propaganda</b> coup.|$|E
5|$|Following the US {{entry into}} World War II Townsend {{was arrested for}} acting as a Japanese agent without {{registering}} under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. He pleaded guilty, admitting that he had accepted payments before the war from <b>a</b> <b>propaganda</b> organization funded by the Japanese government, but denying {{that he was a}} Japanese agent. He received a prison sentence and while serving was involved in the Great Sedition Trial. After the war Townsend moved to Fairfax, Virginia, where he died on 25 January 1976. His writings continue to be influential in far-right circles.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels, however, wanted more, {{and he saw}} in Wessel's {{shooting}} the possibility of <b>a</b> <b>propaganda</b> bonanza. The beginning of his plan was to turn Wessel's funeral into a mass demonstration full of speeches and processions of SA men in uniform, {{but he could not}} get the necessary police permits to do so, even after Wessel's sister requested Hindenburg to relent.|$|E

5|$|He next {{turned to}} the subject of wartime female factory workers in The Most Beautiful, <b>a</b> <b>propaganda</b> film which he shot in a semi-documentary style in early 1944. In order to coax {{realistic}} performances from his actresses, the director had them live in a real factory during the shoot, eat the factory food and call each other by their character names. He would use similar methods with his performers throughout his career.|$|E
5|$|In August 1991, the Yugoslav Air Force's Counterintelligence Service (KOS) {{executed}} {{a series of}} activities, codenamed Operation Labrador, aimed at discrediting the new Croatian government. Operation Labrador was planned to include several terrorist attacks that would go hand-in-hand with the activities of Operation Opera — <b>a</b> <b>propaganda</b> campaign devised to feed disinformation to the media. The two operations were intended to portray Croatia as a pro-fascist state. An alternative name for Operation Opera was Operation Opera-Orijentalis, or Operation Opera Orientalis.|$|E
5|$|Jadid's {{government}} {{was the most}} radical administration in Syria's history. The coup created a permanent schism between the Syrian and Iraqi regional branches of the Ba'ath Party and their respective National Commands, with many senior Syrian Ba'athists defecting to Iraq. As {{a legacy of the}} coup, during Jadid's rule, Syria initiated <b>a</b> <b>propaganda</b> campaign against the Iraqi Ba'athists. Jadid's government would be overthrown in the Corrective Movement of 1970, which brought Hafez al-Assad to power.|$|E

5|$|Revolutionary sentiments were stoked in 1872 {{after three}} priests—Mariano Gómez, José Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora (collectively known as Gomburza)—were accused of sedition by colonial {{authorities}} and executed. This would inspire <b>a</b> <b>propaganda</b> movement in Spain, organized by Marcelo H. del Pilar, José Rizal, and Mariano Ponce, lobbying for political {{reforms in the}} Philippines. Rizal was eventually executed on December 30, 1896, on charges of rebellion. As attempts at reform met with resistance, Andrés Bonifacio in 1892 established the secret society called the Katipunan, who sought independence from Spain through armed revolt.|$|E
5|$|The 1945 Allied {{conference in}} San Francisco {{established}} the multi-national United Nations (UN) {{for the maintenance}} of world peace, but the enforcement capacity of its Security Council was effectively paralyzed by individual members' ability to use veto power. Accordingly, the UN was essentially converted into an inactive forum for exchanging polemical rhetoric, and the Soviets regarded it almost exclusively as <b>a</b> <b>propaganda</b> tribune.|$|E
5|$|The Turkish {{forces in}} Anatolia {{were led by}} Mustafa Kemal, who Hananu {{established}} contact with via intermediaries, chief of whom was Jamil Ibrahim Pasha. The latter, who was an Arabized Kurd, Ottoman World War veteran and absentee landlord from Aleppo, met Mustafa Kemal in Gaziantep {{in the late summer}} of 1920. During their meeting, an agreement was concluded to launch <b>a</b> <b>propaganda</b> campaign funded by the Turks against the French occupation. The campaign began in Aleppo in December 1920.|$|E

5|$|The book traces {{financial}} support for climate change denial to the fossil fuel industry, asserting these companies have attempted to influence public opinion on the matter. Washington and Cook write that politicians {{have a tendency to}} use weasel words as part of <b>a</b> <b>propaganda</b> tactic through use of spin, as a way to deflect public interest away from climate change and remain passive on the issue. The authors conclude that if the public ceased engaging in denial, the problem of climate change could be realistically addressed.|$|E
5|$|Through {{a contact}} at the War Office, Guest had his name {{added to a}} list of {{officers}} available for special employment, and was selected to undertake <b>a</b> <b>propaganda</b> tour of the United States, delivering 160 lectures to approximately 282,000 people in total. He was then sent to France to promote the benefits of Southern Rhodesia to the large number of soldiers who had become unsettled and wished to emigrate. Guest then returned to Rhodesia with his family, who had spent most of the war in England.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1984 the New Order {{government}} used Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI as <b>a</b> <b>propaganda</b> vehicle, {{showing it}} annually on 30 September. The film was broadcast by the state-owned network TVRI, {{and later on}} private television stations after they were established. It was also shown at schools and government institutions; students would be taken to open fields to view the film in a group. Because of this use, Sen and Hill suggest that Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI is the most-broadcast and most-watched Indonesian film of all time. A 2000 survey by the Indonesian magazine Tempo found 97percent of the 1,101 students surveyed had seen the film; 87percent of them had seen it more than once.|$|E
