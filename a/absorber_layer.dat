It can be easily assumed that the process cost could be lowered by non-vacuum thick-film process such as screen printing, though nano-sized powders of the CIS and CIGS precursors are needed for the paste. For synthesis of the nano-sized CIS and CIGS powders, the solvothermal method has been mainly adopted, for it can easily control particle characteristics and produces much amount of powder [10].

50|$|The {{most common}} device {{structure}} for CIGS solar cells {{is shown in}} the diagram (see Figure 1: Structure of a CIGS device). Soda-lime glass of about of 1-3 milimetres thickness is commonly used as a substrate, because the glass sheets contains sodium, which has been shown to yield a substantial open-circuit voltage increase, notably through surface and grain boundary defects passivation. However, many companies are also looking at lighter and more flexible substrates such as polyimide or metal foils. A molybdenum (Mo) metal layer is deposited (commonly by sputtering) which serves as the back contact and reflects most unabsorbed light back into the CIGS absorber. Following molybdenum deposition a p-type CIGS <b>absorber</b> <b>layer</b> is grown by one of several unique methods. A thin n-type buffer layer is added on top of the absorber. The buffer is typically cadmium sulfide (CdS) deposited via chemical bath deposition.

The i-ZnO layer is used to protect the CdS and the <b>absorber</b> <b>layer</b> from sputtering damage while depositing the ZnO:Al window layer, since the latter is usually deposited by DC sputtering, known as a damaging process.

Hydrogen dilution of silane during the growth of a-Si:H <b>absorber</b> <b>layers</b> is used to suppress light-induced degradation of a-Si:H solar cells. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shows that for higher hydrogen dilution ratios the growth of films becomes strongly inhomogeneous and the transition from amorphous to microcrystalline phase occurs at smaller thickness.

To reach the main objectives of this research, a systematic study was conducted to provide an in-depth understanding of the material science aspects of chalcogenide semiconductor processing.

The particle size distribution of the mechanically synthesized chalcogenide alloy nanopowders could be optimized by controlling the ball milling process parameters, such as milling speed and milling time. Suspension inks were prepared from mechanically synthesized chalcogenide alloy nanopowders, via solvent exchange and re-dispersing of chalcogenide alloy nanopowders in environmentally friendly solvents suitable for coating. Nanopowder suspension inks were coated on Mo-sputtered glass substrates via doctor blade coating followed by a drying process for the formation of 1 - 2 μm thin crack-free and organic phase free nanopowder precursor coatings.

Diborane or Trimethylboron gas mixed with SiH4 is used to deposit p-type a-Si layer, while, Phosphine gas mixed with SiH4 is used to deposit n-type a-Si layer. It should be noted that direct deposition of doped a-Si layers on c-Si wafer is shown to have very poor passivation properties. This is most likely due to dopant induced defect generation in a-Si layers. Sputtered Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) is commonly used as a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer on top of the front and back a-Si layer in bi-facial design, as a-Si has high lateral resistance. It is generally deposited on the back side as well fully metallized cell to avoid diffusion of back metal and also for impedance matching for the reflected light. The silver/aluminum grid of 50-100μm thick is deposited through stencil printing for the front contact and back contact for bi-facial design. The detailed description of the fabrication process can be found in.|$|E
50|$|NREL {{developed}} another {{process that}} involves three deposition steps and produced the current CIGS efficiency record holder at 20.3%. The {{first step in}} NREL's method is codeposition of In, Ga, and Se. This is followed by Cu and Se deposited at a higher temperature to allow for diffusion and intermixing of the elements. In the final stage In, Ga, and Se are again deposited to make the overall composition Cu deficient. Würth Solar began producing CIGS cells using an inline coevaporation system in 2005 with module efficiencies between 11% and 12%. They opened another production facility and continued to improve efficiency and yield. Other companies scaling up coevaporation processes include Global Solar and Ascent Solar. Global Solar used an inline three stage deposition process. In all of the steps Se is supplied in excess in the vapor phase. In and Ga are first evaporated followed by Cu and then by In and Ga to make the film Cu deficient. These films performed quite favorably {{in relation to other}} manufacturers and to absorbers grown at NREL and the Institute for Energy Conversion (IEC). However, modules of Global Solar’s films did not perform as well. The property in which the module most obviously under-performed was a low VOC, which is characteristic of high defect density and high recombination velocities. Global Solar’s <b>absorber</b> <b>layer</b> outperformed the NREL absorber in carrier lifetime and hall mobility. However, as completed cells the NREL sample performed better. This is evidence of a poor CIGS/CdS interface, possibly {{due to the lack of}} an ODC surface layer on the Global Solar film. Disadvantages include uniformity issues over large areas and the related difficulty of coevaporating elements in an inline system. Also, high growth temperatures raise the thermal budget and costs. Additionally, coevaporation is plagued by low material utilization (deposition on chamber walls instead of the substrate, especially for selenium) and expensive vacuum equipment. A way to enhance Se utilisation is via a thermal or plasma-enhanced selenium-cracking process, which can be coupled with an ion beam source for ion beam assisted deposition.|$|E

In this study, <b>absorber</b> <b>layer</b> parameters thickness have been investigated by (SCAPS) {{to find out the}} higher conversion. Moreover, it is found that Jsc,Voc, η is increased for the <b>absorber</b> <b>layer</b> thickness of 500 - 600 nm and quantum efficiency is nearly overlap after the 600 nm thickness of the Si <b>absorber</b> <b>layer.</b> In addition, it is revealed that the highest efficiency cell can be achieved with the <b>absorber</b> <b>layer</b> thickness of 600 nm. From the simulation results, numerous influences of <b>absorber</b> <b>layer</b> are investigated in Si/CdS/ZnO solar cell which can lead to the fabrication of high efficiency devices.

40|$|Two {{approaches}} for {{the replacement of}} the toxic KCN etching step in the production of CuInS 2 CIS <b>absorber</b> <b>layers</b> are presented. The electrochemical conditioning in acidic V 2 V 3 electrolyte comprises two treatment stages, the first one being the removal of covellite CuS at moderate anodic potentials and the second one the dissolution of a small sacrificial layer of CIS together with remnant copper sulphides at more aggressive potentials. This procedure yields <b>absorber</b> <b>layers</b> which are 3. 3 efficient in photoelectrochemical solar cells PECS and 8 efficient in solid state devices. The other approach is a combined electrochemical chemical conditioning where the free energy of formation of a Cu EDTA complex contributes to the copper sulphide dissolution and facilitates the removal of Cu S phases at moderate electrochemical potentials. CIS films after this conditioning yield 1. 44 in PEC...|$|R
40|$|Microcrystalline {{silicon carbide}} (mu c-SiC:H) window layers {{prepared}} by Hot-Wire Chemical Vapor Deposition (HWCVD) were applied in {{thin film silicon}} solar cells with microcrystalline silicon (mu c-Si:H) <b>absorber</b> <b>layers.</b> The intrinsic mu c-Si:H absorber was prepared by HWCVD or Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) {{over a wide range}} of crystalline volume fractions. With both types of <b>absorber</b> <b>layers</b> high solar cell short circuit current densities (j(SC)) can be obtained due to the highly transparent mu c-SiC:H window layer and better optical matching. Using the mu c-Si:H absorber prepared by HWCVD yields an additional improvement in the open circuit voltage (V-OC) of about 20 mV. A 1 mu m thick tic-Si: H cell was obtained with V-OC = 549 mV and j(SC) = 25. 6 mA/cm(2) resulting in an efficiency of 9. 2 %. (C) 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinhei...|$|R
