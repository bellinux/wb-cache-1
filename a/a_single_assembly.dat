25|$|Assembly {{language}} is still taught in most computer science and electronic engineering programs. Although few programmers today regularly work with assembly {{language as a}} tool, the underlying concepts remain very important. Such fundamental topics as binary arithmetic, memory allocation, stack processing, character set encoding, interrupt processing, and compiler design {{would be hard to}} study in detail without a grasp of how a computer operates at the hardware level. Since a computer's behavior is fundamentally defined by its instruction set, the logical way to learn such concepts is to study an assembly language. Most modern computers have similar instruction sets. Therefore, studying <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>assembly</b> {{language is}} sufficient to learn: I) the basic concepts; II) to recognize situations where the use of assembly language might be appropriate; and III) to see how efficient executable code can be created from high-level languages. This is analogous to children needing to learn the basic arithmetic operations (e.g., long division), although calculators are widely used for all except the most trivial calculations.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Microsoft {{released}} {{a version of}} DirectX compatible with the Microsoft [...]NET Framework, thus allowing programmers {{to take advantage of}} DirectX functionality from within [...]NET applications using compatible languages such as managed C++ or the use of the C# programming language. This API was known as [...] "Managed DirectX" [...] (or MDX for short), and claimed to operate at 98% of performance of the underlying native DirectX APIs. In December 2005, February 2006, April 2006, and August 2006, Microsoft released successive updates to this library, culminating in a beta version called Managed DirectX 2.0. While Managed DirectX 2.0 consolidated functionality that had previously been scattered over multiple assemblies into <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>assembly,</b> thus simplifying dependencies on it for software developers, development on this version has subsequently been discontinued, and it is no longer supported. The Managed DirectX 2.0 library expired on October 5, 2006.|$|E
60|$|I attach {{little weight}} to the {{argument}} oftenest urged for having two Chambers--to prevent precipitancy, and compel a second deliberation; for {{it must be a}} very ill-constituted representative assembly in which the established forms of business do not require many more than two deliberations. The consideration which tells most, in my judgment, in favor of two Chambers (and this I do regard as of some moment), is the evil effect produced upon the mind of any holder of power, whether an individual or an assembly, by the consciousness of having only themselves to consult. It is important that no set of persons should be able, even temporarily, to make their sic volo prevail without asking any one else for his consent. A majority in <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>assembly,</b> when it has assumed a permanent character--when composed of the same persons habitually acting together, and always assured of victory in their own House--easily becomes despotic and overweening if released from the necessity of considering whether its acts will be concurred in by another constituted authority. The same reason which induced the Romans to have two consuls makes it desirable there should be two Chambers--that neither of them may be exposed to the corrupting influence of undivided power even for the space of a single year. One of the most indispensable requisites in the practical conduct of politics, especially in the management of free institutions, is conciliation; a readiness to compromise; a willingness to concede something to opponents, and to shape good measures so as to be as little offensive as possible to persons of opposite views; and of this salutary habit, the mutual give and take (as it has been called) between two houses is a perpetual school--useful as such even now, and its utility would probably be even more felt in a more democratic constitution of the Legislature.|$|E
