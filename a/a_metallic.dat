5|$|The largest {{category}} of nitrides are the interstitial nitrides of formulae MN, M2N, and M4N (although variable composition is perfectly possible), where the small nitrogen atoms are positioned {{in the gaps}} in <b>a</b> <b>metallic</b> cubic or hexagonal close-packed lattice. They are opaque, very hard, and chemically inert, melting only at very high temperatures (generally over 2500°C). They have <b>a</b> <b>metallic</b> lustre and conduct electricity as do metals. They hydrolyse only very slowly to give ammonia or nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|Apart from headache, about 50% of {{patients}} experience neck pain or stiffness, nausea, and vomiting. Other symptoms include dizziness and vertigo, facial numbness or weakness, unusually blurry or double vision, neuralgia, fatigue, or <b>a</b> <b>metallic</b> taste in the mouth. Leaking CSF {{can sometimes be}} felt or observed as a discharge from the nose or ear.|$|E
5|$|Dysprosium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Dy and atomic number 66. It {{is a rare}} earth element with <b>a</b> <b>metallic</b> silver luster. Dysprosium is never found in nature as a free element, though it is found in various minerals, such as xenotime. Naturally occurring dysprosium is composed of seven isotopes, the most abundant of which is 164Dy.|$|E

50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 10.5-14.5 mm. The ground colour of the forewings is dark grey with a rosy-red costal patch, <b>a</b> bluish <b>metallic</b> mark, <b>a</b> {{series of}} <b>metallic</b> spots and ochreous-brown streaks. The hindwings are brownish grey.|$|R
5|$|Dysprosium is a {{rare earth}} element that has <b>a</b> <b>metallic,</b> bright silver luster. It is soft enough to be cut with a knife, and can be {{machined}} without sparking if overheating is avoided. Dysprosium's physical characteristics can be greatly affected by even small amounts of impurities.|$|E
5|$|Given that Ganymede is {{completely}} differentiated and has <b>a</b> <b>metallic</b> core, its intrinsic magnetic field is probably generated {{in a similar}} fashion to the Earth's: as a result of conducting material moving in the interior. The magnetic field detected around Ganymede is likely to be caused by compositional convection in the core, if the magnetic field is the product of dynamo action, or magnetoconvection.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{begins with}} a metal box brought in {{containing}} the remains of Billy Miles. The coroner examines it and notices {{what appears to be}} a metal vertebra.

Meanwhile, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Monica Reyes arrive at the abandoned town where Special Agent John Doggett (Robert Patrick) was born.|$|E

5|$|Typical {{metalloids}} have <b>a</b> <b>metallic</b> appearance, {{but they}} are brittle and only fair conductors of electricity. Chemically, they behave mostly as nonmetals. They can form alloys with metals. Most of their other {{physical and chemical properties}} are intermediate in nature. Metalloids are usually too brittle to have any structural uses. They and their compounds are used in alloys, biological agents, catalysts, flame retardants, glasses, optical storage and optoelectronics, pyrotechnics, semiconductors, and electronics.|$|E
