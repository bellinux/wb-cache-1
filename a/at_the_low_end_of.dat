5|$|In 1993, Collins' husband, Bill, {{was charged}} in an influence-peddling scandal. The {{prosecution}} claimed that while Collins was governor, Dr. Collins exploited {{a perception that}} he could influence the awarding of state contracts through his wife. It was alleged that he exploited this perception to pressure people who did business with the state to invest nearly $2million with him. He was convicted on October 14, 1993, after a seven-week trial; {{he was given a}} sentence of five years and three months in federal prison, which was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the range prescribed by the federal sentencing guidelines. He was also fined $20,000 for a conspiracy charge that involved kickbacks disguised as political contributions. Governor Collins was called to testify in the trial, but was not charged. The scandal tarnished her image, however, and may have cost her an appointment in the administration of President Bill Clinton. Collins was also rumored to be considering running for the U.S. Senate, a bid which never materialized following her husband's conviction. The Collinses reunited following Dr. Collins' release from prison on October 10, 1997.|$|E
5|$|The Tokyo Mew Mew manga {{series was}} well {{received}} by English-speaking audiences. In March and April 2003, {{the first volume}} sold an estimated 1,597 and 1,746 copies respectively. This put the volume <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the top 50 sales for each month. By 2004, {{with most of the}} series released, it became a mild success for licensor Tokyopop. It was ranked number 16 on the list of Manga Top 50 for the first quarter of 2004 in the ICv2 Retailers Guide to Anime/Manga, based on sales from both mainstream bookstores and comic book shops. Sales of the sixth and seventh volumes dropped slightly; however, both were among the top 100 best-selling graphic novels in March and May 2004. The first volume of Tokyo Mew Mew à la Mode debuted 63rd on the list of top 100 best-selling graphic novels of May 2005, with nearly double the sales figures of the last volume of the main series. On the Nielsen Bookscan charts, the volume debuted at rank 39 before quickly climbing to the 14th spot. The second volume of à la Mode saw similar success, debuting in the 69th slot before advancing to the 12th position, a result of the Mew Mew Power show appearing on 4Kids TV.|$|E

25|$|The relief {{expedition}} {{was attacked}} at Abu Klea on 17 January, {{and two days}} later at Abu Kru. Though their square was broken at Abu Klea, the British managed to repel the Mahdists. The Mahdi, hearing of the British advance, decided to press the attack on Khartoum. On the night of 25–26 January an estimated 50,000 Mahdists attacked the city wall just before midnight. The Mahdists {{took advantage of the}} low level of the Nile, actually crossing it on foot, and rushed around the wall on the shores of the river and into the town. The details of the final assault are vague, but it is said that by 3:30 am, the Mahdists managed to concurrently outflank the city wall <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Nile while another force, led by Al Nujumi, broke down the Massalamieh Gate despite taking some casualties from mines and barbed wire obstacles laid out by Gordon's men.

The [...] "C" [...] in the term then does double duty, referring not only to quality that is lower than [...] "B" [...] but also to the initial c of cable. Helping to popularize the notion of the C movie was the TV series Mystery Science Theater 3000 (1988–99), which ran on national cable channels (first Comedy Central, then the Sci Fi Channel) after its first year. Updating a concept introduced by TV hostess Vampira over three decades before, MST3K presented cheap, low-grade movies, primarily science fiction of the 1950s and 1960s, along with running voiceover commentary highlighting the films' shortcomings. Director Ed Wood has been called [...] "the master of the 'C-movie in this sense, although Z movie (see below) is perhaps even more applicable to his work.
