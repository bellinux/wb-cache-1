5|$|As a {{birthday}} gift for Marge, Homer buys a blender designed by television chef Paula Paul. He {{goes to a}} health food store called Swapper Jack's, where Paula is giving away autographs, to have Paula sign it. Homer is impressed by the store and {{says he will not}} be shopping at the Kwik-E-Mart any more. Apu, who is there to spy, overhears Homer and the two engage in a fight until the security guards grab hold of Apu and take him away. At the signing, Homer tells Paula that Marge is a big fan of hers. Paula decides that she will call Marge live during her upcoming show to wish her a happy birthday. Meanwhile, Bart gets his mother a rabbit for her birthday. The rabbit chews through the phone lines in the Simpsons' home, causing Marge to miss Paula's call. Paula becomes furious at Marge for not <b>answering</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> as she embarrassed herself on her show. Homer punishes Bart by locking him up in the rabbit's cage.|$|E
25|$|On December 7, 1973, {{investigators}} {{found that an}} 18½-minute portion of one recorded tape had been erased. Rose Mary Woods, Nixon’s longtime personal secretary, said she had accidentally erased the tape by pushing the wrong pedal on her tape player when <b>answering</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> The press ran photos of the set-up, showing that it was unlikely for Woods {{to answer the phone}} while keeping her foot on the pedal. Later forensic analysis in 2003 determined that the tape had been erased in several segments—at least five, and perhaps as many as nine.|$|E
25|$|When a {{hardware}} device triggers an interrupt, the operating system's kernel decides {{how to deal}} with this event, generally by running some processing code. The amount of code being run depends on the priority of the interrupt (for example: a person usually responds to a smoke detector alarm before <b>answering</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone).</b> The processing of hardware interrupts is a task that is usually delegated to software called a device driver, which may be part of the operating system's kernel, part of another program, or both. Device drivers may then relay information to a running program by various means.|$|E

500|$|Her {{control over}} the text is less certain. Her staff claim she reads {{everything}} written for publication, but former editor Richard Story has claimed she rarely, if ever, read any of Vogues arts coverage or book reviews. Earlier in her career, she often left writing of the text that accompanied her layouts to others; former coworkers claim she has minimal skills in that area. Today, she writes little for the magazine save the monthly editor's letter. She reportedly has three full-time assistants but sometimes surprises callers by <b>answering</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> herself. She often turns her mobile phone off in order to eat her lunch, usually a steak (or bunless hamburger), undisturbed. High-protein meals have been a habit of hers for a long time. [...] "It was smoked salmon and scrambled eggs every single day" [...] for lunch, says a coworker at Harpers & Queen. [...] "She would eat nothing else." ...|$|E

[...] She joined Alcoholics Anonymous in 1970 and helped counsel other alcoholics on how to reclaim their lives.

2500|$|Like Wolfe, Archie is a {{licensed}} private detective and handles all investigation {{that takes place}} outside the brownstone. He also takes care of routine tasks such as sorting the mail, taking dictation and <b>answering</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> At {{the time of the}} first novel, Fer-de-Lance, Archie had been working for Wolfe for seven years and had by then been trained by Wolfe in his preferred methods of investigation. [...] Like Wolfe, he has developed an extraordinary memory and can recite verbatim conversations that go on for hours. But perhaps his most useful attribute is his ability to bring reluctant people to Wolfe for interrogation.|$|E
2500|$|On February 13, 2000, the day {{following}} Schulz's death, the last-ever new Peanuts strip ran in papers.

Charlie Brown responded with [...] "No, I think he's writing." [...] The panel next to [...] shows Snoopy sitting at his typewriter with the opening to a letter, addressed as [...] "Dear Friends". The final panel features a large blue sky background over which several drawings from past strips are placed. Underneath those drawings is a colorized version of Schulz's January 3 strip, with almost the same note he wrote to the fans which reads as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|According to David Thomson, Rivette was [...] "famous {{for having}} {{little or no}} home life, {{certainly}} not a private life that overlaps with his work. On his own, he would rather sit in the dark with another movie"; in 1956, he was described as [...] "too aloof and forbiddingly intellectual". Bulle Ogier described Rivette as very secretive about his life: [...] "I've {{no idea what he}} does. I only see him when we're filming" [...] or when she bumped into him in public, although she felt close to him. According to Ogier, he had neuroses and anxiety which often prevented him from <b>answering</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> and talking about his personal life would be indiscreet and a betrayal. Laurence Côte said that joining Rivette's inner circle of trusted friends was difficult and required [...] "a number of hurdles to overcome and to respect codes." [...] Martine Marignac said that Rivette was very modest and shy, and that his circle of close friends grew used to not hearing from him for prolonged periods of time. Marignac also said that [...] "He spends his life going to the movies, but also reading, listening to music. It is clear that the world of reality assaults him." [...] Jonathan Romney reported that in the 1970s [...] "Rivette sometimes went AWOL from his own shoots, he would invariably be found watching some rarity in one of the Left Bank art cinemas." [...] Jean-Pierre Léaud, who described Rivette as a close friend, said that he [...] "was the only person who saw everything in a film. And he transmitted everything he saw to us, setting in march our own aesthetic ideas". The director {{was the subject of a}} 1990 documentary, Jacques Rivette, the Night Watchman, directed by Claire Denis and Serge Daney. Travis Mackenzie Hoover wrote that the documentary portrays Rivette with [...] "lonerish tendencies" [...] and as [...] "a sort of transient with no home or country, wandering about or loitering in public space instead of staking out some personal terra firma." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Season 5, {{four years}} after high school graduation, Lucas, now 22, suffers from writer's block and is under {{pressure}} from his editor/girlfriend Lindsey. He also tries to help Haley with her son, James Lucas Scott. When Peyton comes back home, she reveals to him that she did come to the signing, and then inspires him by repeating his quote: [...] "Your art matters". When he tells Peyton that the bartender she is flirting with at the Clothes Over Bros store opening {{is not good enough}} for her, it becomes obvious that, despite his relationship with Lindsey, he still loves Peyton. After remembering the night he proposed, he goes straight to her house, though she is not there. When Peyton begins to antagonize Lindsey, he goes to confront her, but things escalate into a verbal fight about their break up. A little bit later, after Peyton confesses her feelings and kisses him, he kisses her back, passionately, but later proposes to Lindsey, leading Peyton to tell him that she will bury her feelings so that he can be happy. He then wins his first game as the Ravens coach, although the female counterparts miss it because they were locked in the library. He soon has to go to Dan's parole and speak up in order to have him stay locked up. He decides to have Nathan as his best man and then fuses his bachelor party with Lindsey's. He also gives Haley his new book, and she tells him not to marry Lindsey after reading it. Lucas proceeds with the wedding, but Lindsey stops him after realizing his book is about Peyton. She leaves him, and when he chases after her, he sees Lindsey's bags packed. After a confrontation, she leaves him, saying, [...] "People always leave, Luke. You know that." [...] (A reference to one of Peyton's famous lines, also featured in his first book.) Lucas flees to stay with his mother and Andy after the failed wedding. Andy convinces Lucas to go after Lindsey, prompting him to go to her and tell her that one day she will come back to him. She comes back to Tree Hill for Jamie's 5th birthday, but tells Lucas that it was really over. He then helps Brooke cope with having baby Angie around. After Lindsey calls him to tell him she is seeing someone, he blows up after an opposing player gets away with attempting to injure Quentin Fields, drawing himself a 10-game suspension. He becomes heavily drunk and tells Peyton he hates her when she comes to his help. He later apologizes to her after being confronted by Haley. He tells her that it was hard to let her go, hard to see her and that it remains difficult for him, making apparent his love for Peyton. Lindsey comes by to tell him his book is over and he can e-mail her the dedication. When he does, she reveals by phone that she still loves him. He then decides to go to Las Vegas and calls someone to get married. Brooke, Peyton, and Lindsey are all shown <b>answering</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> and the viewers are left hanging as to whom he decides to propose to.|$|E
