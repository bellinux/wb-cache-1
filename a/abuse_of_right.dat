40|$|The {{article is}} devoted {{to one of the}} most disputable {{categories}} of jurisprudence – abuse of rights. Modern civil legislation contains many of the assessment law. Interpretation and specification of evaluative concepts is a challenging intellectual process. <b>Abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> is a consequence of the process of interpretation of appraisal standards. The law does not allow the exercise of civil rights with the intent to harm another person, as well as abuse of rights in any form, including in the form of circumvention of the law. The author regards as the already known issues with the application of the principle of the inadmissibility of abuse of the right, so new in connection with the amendments to the Civil code of the Russian Federation.

40|$|The legal {{construction}} of the aspect <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> substantive <b>right</b> is one <b>of</b> the most important manifestations of equitable principles in civil law.

40|$|Beyond its {{political}} destinations, Europe is a civilization {{that each of}} its constituent parts has contributed its genius, over time. Or Rome, its original matrix, has sent her fundamental right. To what extent can it be another tool for reflection, for mutual understanding, sometimes of harmony, here's {{what seems to be}} necessarily raised, albeit briefly, by this favored means of communication and exchange, that it has always been the contract. Since then the issue is explained by the need to have a contractual law {{in the middle of this}} community adapted to the needs of this new burning community, in Europe of the beginning of the third millennium. In fact, market opening has led to considerable development of trade between the EU-counties and this is exactly cross-border flow through contracts. In this context we aimed to determine the role that it has one of the most important and current principles of law, that of good - faith in European contract law building. It is known that good - faith is experiencing a very special embodiment in the contract, where it assumes many functions. She is the subject of many studies and analysis and is likely to grow rapidly in national and supranational rights. Although contract law has evolved considerably, the theme is present and justified, under conditions which the Roman foundations remain. European contractual universe and its possible developments do not exclude but require an approach in terms of Roman law. Methodologically, the paper is structured as follows: good - faith in contracts, the birth and evolution of the concept (ancient Rome, Middle Ages, modern and contemporary) and contemporary applications - <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>right,</b> information requirements, hardship principle...|$|E
40|$|Standard setting {{organizations}} {{often require}} their members to declare which of their patents {{are essential to}} the practice of a prospective standard, and to agree to license any such standard-essential patents (SEPs) on 2 ̆ 2 fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory 2 ̆ 2 (FRAND) terms. Among the issues that have arisen in recent disputes involving FRAND-encumbered SEPs are (1) whether a FRAND commitment creates a binding contract for the benefit of third parties, obligating the SEP owner to forgo the right to seek injunctive relief for the infringement of the SEP; (2) whether the law of remedies, or other principles of generally applicable civil law such as the doctrine of 2 ̆ 2 <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>right,</b> 2 ̆ 2 can limit the prevailing SEP owner’s ability to obtain injunctive relief; (3) the circustances under which competition law (antitrust) {{may play a role in}} resolving these matters; (4) whether the patentee is entitled to relief in the form of ongoing damages, if one or more of these bodies of law eliminates the possibility of an injunction; and (5) if so, how should courts calculate those damages. This article provides both an overview of how courts and other entities have begun to address these questions in the United States and elsewhere, and my analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of different possible approaches. I argue, among other things, first that courts generally should not allow SEP owners to obtain injunctions, but rather only ongoing damages; second, that in principle though perhaps not always in practice, it is preferable to use contract and patent law to achieve this result, as opposed to antitrust; and third, that in awarding monetary relief for the infringement of SEPs courts should apply the same methodology the use to calculate reasonable royalties generally, subject to a few modifications...|$|E

Third, how to mitigate the negative aspects of the treaty shopping problem? What type of provisions and clauses are necessary to prevent treaty shopping or to reduce the negative side of treat shopping? The article presents in Part II the recent evolution of international investment law and identifies the legal determinants of treaty shopping.
