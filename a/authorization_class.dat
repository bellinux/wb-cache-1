40|$|In {{this work}} we {{address the problem}} of {{detection}} and resolution of conflicts/anomalies between XACML (eXtensible Access Control Markup Language) policies of access control. We mean here by conflict/Anomaly the case where several policies give conflicting answers (deny, allow) to a same access request. Indeed, this problem is foreseeable in access control systems based on policies in general. We give more attention to the mathematical formalism of the problem. We introduce the notion of the canonical representation of the query space. This is a partition of the query space formed by authorization classes. Each <b>authorization</b> <b>class</b> regroups queries that are intercepted by the same policies. This classification provides a natural way to handle interferences between policy targets (in other words conflicts/anomalies). Then we bring the study of the problem from the whole query space to elements of its canonical representation. The final result of this work is a Framework for detection and resolution of conflicts/anomalies between XACML policies. This Framework, which is located in the PAP (Policy Administration Point), is responsible for generating a conflicts-free representation from the initially provided policies. This representation is dynamically maintained and updated by the Framework following the addition, deletion or modification of policies...|$|E

40|$|This article, {{based on}} ethnographic work in rural Tamil Nadu, explores the {{relative}} invisibility {{of class and}} its characteristic modes of operation {{in the literature on}} medical pluralism in India. Using, as key concepts, habit, comfort, pre-familiarity and familiarization, the article suggests that we can shift the way we think of 'pragmatism', the term that is routinely used to describe subjects who follow pluralist strategies. In reconceptualizing pragmatism, we can allow ourselves to glimpse anew the workings of class within pluralist strategies. The article takes inspiration from Gramsci's critique of the self-evidence of 'common sense', {{as well as from the}} phenomenological aspects of Bourdieu's understanding of class and habitus. It explores the very different levels of comfort and <b>authorization</b> that different <b>classes</b> display in relation to biomedical spaces and practices, as well as towards non-biomedical discursive practices. 14 page(s...|$|R

The CCSD allows individuals {{to complete a}} staff development program to earn an authorization to serve English learners. Timelines have been established for a smooth transition to implement the sunset date to allow individuals currently completing a CCSD program to complete the staff development, deliver appropriate materials to the approved programs, and submit applications to the Commission for processing. Key Provisions: The sunset date of January 1, 2008, applies to credential holders of multiple subject, single subject, education specialist, and other previously issued elementary, secondary and special education credentials. The sunset date for the CCSD does not include individuals who hold a designated subjects vocational/career technical education credential or special subject teaching credential or holders of service credentials with a special <b>class</b> <b>authorization.</b> (See Education Code § 44253. 11.) To assist stakeholders, timelines have been established for the processing of applications for the CCSD that are aligned with the sunset date of January 1, 2008. A complete lis...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S., Speech Pathology) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. Research has {{demonstrated}} the overlapping and intertwining relationship between oral language, oral narrative, and developing literacy skills, {{as well as}} the importance of cultural relevance in English Language Learner (ELL instruction). The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine and compare the effects of oral narratives as a component of intervention programs for an understudied, but growing group: Hmong-speaking ELLs. The data analyzed to address the stated research questions were obtained through research completed for a dissertation entitled Response to Intervention and Literacy: A Bright Spot for Hmong Speaking English Language Learners? by Robert A. Pieretti. Dr. Pieretti is a California licensed and credentialed speech-language pathologist with thirteen years of work experience as a Language, Speech, and Hearing Specialist in Public Schools in Northern California. He maintains a Clinical or Rehabilitative Services Credential in Speech-Language Pathology with a Special <b>Class</b> <b>Authorization,</b> a California Clinical Rehabilitative Services Credential, and a Certificate of Clinical Competence with the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association. As Principal Investigator, he led a research team that examined literacy instruction for first grade Hmong- speaking ELLs exhibiting difficulties with reading and the possible benefits that RTI programs may provide to these students. The participants were seen at four Title 1 schools in an urban, inner-city school district in Northern California. Each participant was a first grade student between six and seven years old whose primary language was Hmong and who spoke English as a second language. Participants in each of the three treatment groups participated in two or three group sessions (3 or 4 students per group), depending on the week, for the last seven weeks of school for a total of 19 sessions. Each group was comprised of students with differing levels of English proficiency, and sessions were scheduled so that participants did not miss any of the language arts instruction in their general education classroom. Session length varied by group. Literacy Enhancement Group (LEG) sessions were approximately 25 minutes in length, Oral Narrative Literacy Enhancement Group (ONLEG) sessions were approximately 40 minutes in length, and Culturally Relevant Literacy Enhancement Group (CRONLEG) sessions were approximately 45 minutes in length. Speech-Language Pathologists and Special Education teams may wish to consider developing RTI programs that incorporate some of the methods in Pieretti???s study that appeared to be most successful in improving literacy skills for ELLs with language-based reading difficulties. These include contextualized, language rich oral narrative activities combined with explicit phonological awareness training, targeted contextualized comprehension activities that include interactive story presentations with a vocabulary emphasis, open-ended discussion of the text including scaffolded follow-up questions that encourage elaboration and build meaning, and story retell activities that involve identification and discussion of critical story elements and events. While Pieretti???s study also included a specific culturally-relevant component, it was concluded that cultural relevance may be more efficiently promoted by encouraging students??? engagement with the text, the instructor, and each other through oral narrative activities.
