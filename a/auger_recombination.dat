50|$|The {{blinking}} in nanocrystals {{was first}} reported in 1996. The discovery was unexpected. The {{consensus is that}} blinking happens because illuminated nanocrystals can be charged (or ionized), and then neutralized. Under normal conditions when nanocrystal is neutral, a photon excites an electron-hole pair, which then recombines, emitting another photon and leading to photoluminescence. This process is called radiative recombination. If however, the nanocrystal is charged, the extra carrier triggers a process called non-radiative <b>Auger</b> <b>recombination,</b> where exciton energy is transferred to an extra electron or hole. <b>Auger</b> <b>recombination</b> occurs orders of magnitude faster than the radiative recombination. So photoluminescence is almost entirely suppressed in charged nanocrystals. Scientists still do not fully understand {{the origin of the}} charging and neutralization process. One of the photoexcited carriers (the electron or the hole) must be ejected from the nanocrystal. At some later time, the ejected charge returns to the nanocrystal (restoring charge neutrality and therefore radiative recombination). The details of how these processes occur still are not understood.|$|E

This imposes a limit on the attainable depth of photon antibunching and provides a robust means to study single emitter biexciton physics.

40|$|Abstract. Detailed {{structural}} investigations {{on living}} cells are problematic because existing structural methods cannot reach high resolutions on non-reproducible objects. Illumination with an ultrashort and extremely bright X-ray pulse can outrun key damage processes over {{a very short}} period. This can be exploited to extend the diffraction signal to the highest possible resolution in flash diffraction experiments. Here we present {{an analysis of the}} interaction of a very intense and very short X-ray pulse with a living cell, using a non-equilibrium population kinetics plasma code with radiation transfer. Each element in the evolving plasma is modeled by numerous states to monitor changes in the atomic populations as a function of pulse length, wavelength, and fluence.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} phosphorus ion (P+) implantation in Si nanocrystals (SiNCs) embedded in SiO 2, {{in order to}} clarify the P donor doping effects for photoluminescence (PL) of SiNCs in wide P concentrations ranging in three orders. Some types of defects such as Pb centers were found to remain significantly at the interfaces between SiNCs and the surrounding SiO 2 even by high-temperature (1000 °C) annealing of all the samples. Hydrogen atom treatment (HAT) method can efficiently passivate remaining interface defects, leading to {{significant increase in the}} intensity of PL arising from the recombination of electron-hole pairs confined in SiNCs, in addition to significant decrease in interface defects with dangling bonds detected by electron spin resonance. From both the results of the P dose dependence before and after HAT, it is found that the amount of remaining defects is higher for samples with SiNCs damaged by implantation with relatively lower P+ doses and then annealed, and that through HAT the observed PL intensity increases surely as the P concentration increases up to a critical concentration. Then it begins to decrease due to <b>Auger</b> nonradiative <b>recombination</b> above the critical concentration which depends on the size of SiNCs. These results suggest an effect of relatively low concentration of P atoms for the enhancement of PL intensity of SiNCs and we present an unconventional idea for explaining it...|$|R

5000|$|An {{additional}} {{feature that}} differentiates the ICL {{from all other}} laser diodes is its provision for electrically-pumped operation without a p-n junction. This is possible because the injectors function as rectifying barriers that keep the current flowing in a single direction. Nevertheless, it is highly advantageous to dope certain layers in each cascade stage {{as a means of}} controlling the active electron and hole densities, via a design technique called “carrier rebalancing.” [...] While the most favorable combination of electron and hole populations depends on the relative strengths of various free carrier absorption and <b>Auger</b> <b>recombination</b> processes, the studies done thus far indicate that the ICL performance is optimal when at threshold the two concentrations are roughly equal. Since the hole population tends to substantially exceed the electron population in undoped or moderately-doped ICLs, carrier rebalancing is achieved by heavily n-doping the electron injector (typically, with Si) so as to add electrons to the active QWs.|$|E
50|$|Upon ejection, the {{kinetic energy}} of the Auger {{electron}} corresponds {{to the difference between}} the {{energy of the}} initial electronic transition into the vacancy and the ionization energy for the electron shell from which the Auger electron was ejected.

Auger electron spectroscopy involves the emission of Auger electrons by bombarding a sample with either X-rays or energetic electrons and measures the intensity of Auger electrons that result {{as a function of the}} Auger electron energy. The resulting spectra can be used to determine the identity of the emitting atoms and some information about their environment. <b>Auger</b> <b>recombination</b> is a similar Auger effect which occurs in semiconductors.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{dissertation}} is on {{the theory of the}} electronic dynamical processes in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). The first part of the dissertation introduces the calculation method of electronic eigenstates used through the dissertation, the sp 3 s * tight-binding (TB) method, and the application of the symmetry-adapted linear combination (SALC) of atomic orbitals to the TB method. The combination of the SALC and TB method reduces the computational load, and generates reliable electronic eigenstates and eigenvalues of Wurtzite CdSe QDs. The second part of the dissertation uses the calculated eigenstates and eigenvalues of CdSe QDs, whose band gap states are removed by a passivation layer, to calculate various kinds of physical properties, such as the structure, the permanent dipole moment, the band gap, the molecular orbitals, the density of states (DOS), and the absorption spectrum. These calculated results are compared with the respective experimental measurements in further discussions. The last part of the dissertation focuses on the studies of the size-dependent trend of the <b>Auger</b> electron-hole <b>recombination</b> process that causes the semiconductor QDs to remain in the dark state, including the cases of a negative trion, a positive trion, and a biexciton, in semiconductor QDs. The rates of these Auger processes are expressed in the form of Fermi’s golden rule, where the Coulombic interaction between the two electrons is the operator.

40|$|In this thesis, we {{investigate}} optical and electrical properties of dilute nitride semiconductors GaAsN in pulsed magnetic fields up to 62 T. For the most part, the experiments are {{performed at the}} Dresden High Magnetic Field Laboratory (HLD). In {{the first part of}} this thesis, the electron effective mass of GaAsN is determined with a direct method for the first time. Cyclotron resonance (CR) absorption spectroscopy is performed in Si-doped GaAsN epilayers with a nitrogen content up to 0. 2 %. For the CR absorption study, we use the combination of the free-electron laser FELBE and pulsed magnetic fields at the HLD, both located at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf. A slight increase of the CR electron effective mass with N content is obtained. This result is in excellent agreement with calculations based on the band anticrossing model and the empirical tight-binding method. We also find an increase of the band nonparabolicity with increasing N concentration in agreement with our calculations of the energy dependent momentum effective mass. In the second part of this thesis, the photoluminescence (PL) characteristics of intrinsic GaAsN and n-doped GaAsN:Si is studied. The PL of intrinsic and very dilute GaAsN is characterized by both GaAs-related transitions and N-induced features. These distinct peaks merge into a broad spectral band of localized excitons (LEs) when the N content is increased. This so-called LE-band exhibits a partially delocalized character because of overlapping exciton wave functions and an efficient interexcitonic population transfer. Merged spectra dominate the PL of all Si-doped GaAsN samples. They have contributions of free and localized excitons and are consequently blue-shifted with respect to LE-bands of intrinsic GaAsN. The highly merged PL profiles of GaAsN:Si are studied systematically for the first time with temperature-dependent time-resolved PL. The PL decay is predominantly monoexponential and has a strong energy dispersion. In comparison to formerly reported values of intrinsic GaAsN epilayers, the determined decay times of GaAsN:Si are reduced by a factor of 10 because of enhanced Shockley-Read-Hall and possibly <b>Auger</b> <b>recombinations.</b> In the third part of this thesis, intrinsic and Si-doped GaAsN are investigated with magneto-PL in fields up to 62 T. A magneto-PL setup for pulsed magnetic fields of the HLD was built for this purpose. The blue-shift of LE-bands is studied in high magnetic fields in order to investigate its delocalized character. The blue-shift is diminished in intrinsic GaAsN at higher temperatures, which indicates that the interexcitonic population transfer is only active below a critical temperature 20 K < T < 50 K. A similar increase of the temperature has no significant impact on the partially delocalized character of the merged spectral band of GaAsN:Si. We conclude that the interexcitonic transfer of Si-doped GaAsN is more complex than in undoped GaAsN. In order to determine reduced masses of undoped GaAsN and GaAs:Si, the field-induced shift of the free exciton transition is studied in the high-field limit. We find an excellent agreement of GaAs:Si with a formerly published value of intrinsic GaAs which was determined with the same method. In both cases, the reduced mass values are enhanced by 20 % in comparison to the accepted reduced mass values of GaAs. The determined GaAsN masses are 1. 5 times larger than in GaAs:Si and match the rising trend of formerly reported electron effective masses of GaAsN...|$|R
