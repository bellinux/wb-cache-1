In 1996 Rajab discussed the idea of setting up <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> organization with Ali Rabea and Ibrahim Kamal Al Den. They introduced him to Salman Kamal Al Den, Sabeeka Al Najjar, Mohammed Al Motawa and other colleagues with whom they held secret meetings.

5000|$|Brian Schepis, a {{colleague}} of Cerf at Google, defends Cerf's conclusion {{on the grounds that}} advocates for <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> to the Internet improperly define the qualifications of <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>right.</b> Schepis argues that <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> should only protect things that are instrumentally necessary for membership in a political community and, although the Internet is instrumentally valuable for membership, it should not be seen as <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> in and of itself because it is not necessary for membership. In claiming <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> to the Internet, advocates devalue the overall effectiveness of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> as tools of justification in global political arena through a process called [...] "human rights inflation".|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This paper aims {{to respond}} to {{increasing}} interest in the intersection between accounting and <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> and to explore whether access to information might itself constitute <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>right.</b> <b>As</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> have "moral force", establishing access to information as <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> may act {{as a catalyst for}} policy change. The paper also aims to focus on environmental information, and specifically the case of corporate water-related disclosures. Design/methodology/approach: This paper follows Griffin and Sen, who suggest that <b>a</b> candidate <b>human</b> <b>right</b> might be recognised when it is consistent with "founding" <b>human</b> <b>rights,</b> it is important and it may be influenced by societal action. The specific case for access to corporate water-related information to constitute <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> is evaluated against these principles. Findings: Access to corporate water-related disclosures may indeed constitute <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>right.</b> Political participation is <b>a</b> founding <b>human</b> <b>right,</b> water is <b>a</b> critical subject of political debate, water-related information is required in order for political participation and the state {{is in a position to}} facilitate provision of such information. Corporate water disclosures may not necessarily be in the form of annual sustainability reports, however, but may include reporting by government agencies via public databases and product labelling. A countervailing corporate right to privacy is considered and found to be relevant but not necessarily incompatible with heightened disclosure obligations. Originality/value: This paper seeks to make both a theoretical and a practical contribution. Theoretically, the paper explores how reporting might be conceived from a rights-based perspective and provides a method for determining which disclosures might constitute <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>right.</b> Practically, the paper may assist those calling for improved disclosure regulation by showing how such calls might be embedded within <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> discourse. 45 page(s...|$|R

40|$|<b>Human</b> <b>rights</b> are {{commonly}} taken to include both behavioral freedoms, {{such as a}} right to express opinions, and safeguards against the behaviors of others, such as a right not to be tortured. I examine the claim by Allen Buchanan and others that democracy should be considered <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>right.</b> I discuss what <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> are, what they do, and what they obligate moral agents to do, comparing this framework to attributes of democracy. I conclude that while democracy itself is both too nebulous and too specific {{to be the subject}} of <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>right,</b> it may be proper to speak of <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> to state self-determination...|$|R
25|$|Article 17 {{provides}} {{that no one}} may use the rights guaranteed by the Convention to seek the abolition or limitation of rights guaranteed in the Convention.

5|$|Human Rights Commission: In {{a report}} on de facto couples {{presented}} to the Justice Minister in May 2006, the Irish Human Rights Commission evaluated international standards in dealing with unmarried couples, and assessed the changes needed in Irish law from <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> perspective.

5|$|Recent {{literature}} exploring bioethical {{questions from}} <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> perspective has been criticised {{on the grounds}} that human rights theory contains unresolved problems. Bioethicists have claimed that bioethical inquiry can contribute to resolving these problems. Cochrane claims that this contribution to human rights literature offers three insights, but that these are not entirely original. These insights are questions about institutional fairness, rights as trumps and rights as solely belonging to humans. Cochrane holds that human rights should be reconceptualised as sentient rights. The grounding of human rights, he claims, are not distinct from the grounding of human obligations to nonhuman animals, and attempts to distinguish human rights from the rights of other sentient beings ultimately fail.|$|E
5|$|Having worked {{together}} for communist {{organizations in the}} mid-1980s, Faeq al-Mir and Elias Atallah boasted a close relationship {{at the time of}} the arrest. Al-Mir, <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> activist, led the left-wing People’s Democratic Party, an unauthorized party critical of the Syrian government. Atallah was the leader and sole parliamentarian of the Democratic Left Movement, a leftist Lebanese party. He was also a senior figure in the March 14 Alliance, a Lebanese parliamentary coalition critical of Syrian policies. The two conversed over the phone several times prior to the arrest. They often lamented the assassinations of anti-Syrian Lebanese figures like Samir Kassir. Al-Mir, who was released from a previous ten-year prison sentence related to political activism in 1999, visited Lebanon in 2006 to mourn the killing of George Hawi, a former leader of the Lebanese Communist Party. According to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, this contributed to al-Mir's arrest at the end of the year.|$|E

5|$|In the Soviet times, mental {{hospitals}} were frequently created in former monasteries, barracks, and even concentration camps. Sofia Dorinskaya, <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> activist and psychiatrist, says she saw former convicts {{who have been}} living in a Russian mental hospital for ten years and will have been staying there until their dying day because of having no home. Deinstitutionalization has not touched many of the hospitals, and persons still die inside them. In 2013, 70 persons died in a fire just outside Novgorod and Moscow. Living conditions are often insufficient and sometimes horrible: 12 to 15 patients in a big room with bars on the windows, no bedside tables, often no partitions, not enough toilets. The number of outpatient clinics designed for the primary care of the mentally disordered stopped increasing in 2005 and was reduced to 277 in 2012 as against 318 in 2005. Stigma linked to mental disease is at the level of xenophobia. The Russian public perceive the mentally sick as harmful, useless, incurable, and dangerous. The social stigma is maintained not only by the general public but also by psychiatrists.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, his The Ambivalence of 1960 was {{featured}} in an exhibition at the Casino Luxembourg. The piece is a six-minute collage of speeches from Nigeria's 1960 independence festivities, including those of President Nnamdi Azikiwe, Prime Minister Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, and English Princess Alexandra of Kent. Their aspirations for <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights,</b> freedom, religious tolerance, and economic development, compared with the present day, show Nigeria's political failures over the previous half-century. Ogboh visited New York City in September 2014 with his danfo share taxi, a symbol of public transport in Lagos, for a one-day installation (Lagos State of Mind II at The Africa Center in Harlem. The installation included photos of the taxi with historic landmarks and African-American neighborhoods in New York City, juxtaposed against sounds situated {{in and out of}} the taxi. One of Ogboh's earlier works, Verbal Maps of Ojuelegba, features a Lagos danfo driver reciting the Ojuelegba route. The artist noted how hawking has been banned on Lagos's new roads and that the danfo share taxi will eventually disappear, along with their contribution to the city's soundscapes. This historical element was not an initial consideration in the project, though the artist planned for his future work to narrate the transformation of the city.|$|E
5|$|Published posthumously, The Autobiography of MalcolmX is {{an account}} of the life of MalcolmX, born Malcolm Little (1925–1965), who became <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> activist. Beginning with his mother's pregnancy, the book {{describes}} Malcolm's childhood in Michigan, {{the death of his father}} under questionable circumstances, and his mother's deteriorating mental health that resulted in her commitment to a psychiatric hospital. Little's young adulthood in Boston and New York City is covered, as well as his involvement in organized crime. This led to his arrest and subsequent eight- to ten-year prison sentence, of which he served six-and-a-half years (1946–1952). The book addresses his ministry with Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam (1952–1963) and his emergence as the organization's national spokesman. It documents his disillusionment with and departure from the Nation of Islam in March 1964, his pilgrimage to Mecca, which catalyzed his conversion to orthodox Sunni Islam, and his travels in Africa. MalcolmX was assassinated in New York's Audubon Ballroom in February 1965, before they finished the book. His co-author, journalist Alex Haley, summarizes the last days of MalcolmX's life, and describes in detail their working agreement, including Haley's personal views on his subject, in the Autobiography's epilogue.|$|E

30|$|Our brief {{discussion}} of {{provision in the}} health care, education and housing sectors shows that defining the provision of a service as <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> generates public and political support.

Yet, the transport domain could clearly benefit if interested parties would actively advocate <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> to (sufficient) mobility or (sufficient) accessibility. The extensive body of literature on transport-related social exclusion could serve as the empirical basis for such a demand (see [36]).|$|R
