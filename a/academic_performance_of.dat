Hundred and thirty four high school and university students were selected based on stratified sampling from Zlin, Czech Republic. The study process of respondents was measured by employing the 'revised two-factor Study Process Questionnaire' of Biggs et. al (2001). Descriptive and inferential analysis of data was conducted using the SPSS software. The Study Approaches, Study Motives, and Study Strategies employed by respondents during the study process were examined. There <b>Academic</b> <b>performances</b> were also noted. Respondents have have relied more on 'Surface' study approaches, over 'Deep' study approaches.

Beginning in 2015 the program would require an incremental rise in applying athletes' Grade Point Average. By 2017–2018 at least 80 percent of incoming athletes would be required to have a high school GPA of at least 3.0, the university's general admission standard. Except for Stanford, this would be the strictest requirement in the Pac-12.

25|$|Locus {{of control}} is a salient factor in the {{successful}} <b>academic</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> students. During the 1970s and '80s, Cassandra B. Whyte did significant educational research studying locus of control as related to the academic achievement of students pursuing higher education coursework. Much of her educational research and publications focused upon the theories of Julian B. Rotter {{in regard to the}} importance of internal control and successful academic performance. Whyte reported that individuals who perceive and believe that their hard work may lead to more successful academic outcomes, instead of depending on luck or fate, persist and achieve academically at a higher level. Therefore, it is important to provide education and counseling in this regard.|$|E

A {{survey by the}} Atlanta Journal-Constitution found that schools with strong athletics departments tended to have athletes with lower SAT scores than non-athletic students.
