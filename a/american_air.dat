5|$|Hiryū {{reinforced}} the CAP with launches of 3 more Zeros at 08:25. These fresh Zeros helped defeat the next <b>American</b> <b>air</b> strike from Midway, 11 Vought SB2U Vindicator dive bombers from VMSB-241, which attacked the battleship Haruna starting around 08:30. Haruna escaped damage and 3 of the Vindicators were shot down. Although all the <b>American</b> <b>air</b> strikes had thus far caused negligible damage, {{they kept the}} Japanese carrier forces off-balance as Nagumo endeavored to prepare a response to news, received at 08:20, of the sighting of American carrier forces to his northeast.|$|E

5|$|During April 6, 80 SAMs were {{launched}} by the NVA {{in the area around}} Hambleton. It was estimated that Hambleton and Clark {{were in the midst of}} five or six NVA battalions.

5|$|Hiyō spent November in Truk, {{during which}} time she was twice {{slightly}} damaged by <b>American</b> <b>air</b> raids, before returning to Japan in early December where she was rejoined {{by the rest of}} her air group. Aside from a brief refit at Kure from 26 February to 4 March 1943, the ship was training in the Inland Sea until she sailed for Truk on 22 March. Her air group consisted of 27 Zeros and 12 D3As at this time. They were detached from Hiyō in early April to participate in Operation I-Go, a land-based aerial offensive against Allied bases in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. The carrier was again lightly damaged from bomb splinters on 12 April from an <b>American</b> <b>air</b> attack. After her air group returned, the ship arrived back in Japan on 21 May in case she was needed to relieve Japanese forces fighting on the Attu Island.|$|E

5|$|North <b>American</b> <b>air</b> {{space was}} closed for several days after the attacks and air travel {{decreased}} upon its reopening, leading to a nearly 20% cutback in air travel capacity, and exacerbating financial problems in the struggling U.S. airline industry.|$|E
5|$|Rolling Thunder {{reached the}} last stage of its {{operational}} evolution during 1967 and 1968.

5|$|Sakurajima is {{the title}} of a 1946 short story, written by the Japanese writer Haruo Umezaki, about a disillusioned Navy officer {{stationed}} on the volcano island towards the end of World War II as <b>American</b> <b>air</b> force planes bomb Japan. The story is based on Umezaki's own experience; he was stationed in a military cipher base in the nearby Prefecture city of Kagoshima.|$|E

5|$|Also on August 29, the ROK Capital Division, with American {{tank and}} {{artillery}} support, recaptured Kigye {{and held it}} during the night against North Korean counterattacks, only to lose it again at dawn. <b>American</b> <b>air</b> attacks continued at an increased tempo in the Kigye area. South Korean troops reported finding the bodies of many North Koreans, apparently killed by air attack. They also found many suits of white clothing scattered on the ground, abandoned when North Korean soldiers changed from civilian disguises into military uniforms.|$|E
5|$|Historians Jonathan Parshall and Anthony Tully {{believe that}} by {{combining}} the surviving aircraft and pilots from Shōkaku and Zuikaku, {{it is likely that}} Zuikaku could have been equipped with almost a full composite air group. They also note that doing so would have violated Japanese carrier doctrine, which stressed that carriers and their airgroups must train as a single unit (in contrast, <b>American</b> <b>air</b> squadrons were considered interchangeable between carriers). In any case, the Japanese apparently made no serious attempt to get Zuikaku ready for the forthcoming battle.|$|E
5|$|In late January 1945 the Imperial General Headquarters belatedly {{adopted a}} civil defense plan {{to counter the}} <b>American</b> <b>air</b> raids. This plan {{assigned}} responsibility for fighting fires to community councils and neighborhood groups as the professional firefighting units were short-handed. Civilians were to observe a blackout from 10:00pm. Japanese positions in the Bonin Islands were normally able to provide an hour's warning of American raids and air raid sirens were sounded in cities threatened by attack.|$|E

5|$|Japanese carrier {{doctrine}} {{preferred the}} launching of fully constituted strikes rather than piecemeal attacks. Without confirmation of whether the American force included carriers (not received until 08:20), Nagumo's reaction was doctrinaire. In addition, the arrival of another land-based <b>American</b> <b>air</b> strike at 07:53 gave weight {{to the need to}} attack the island again. In the end, Nagumo decided to wait for his first strike force to land, then launch the reserve, which would by then be properly armed with torpedoes.|$|E
5|$|RAAF Hornets {{were first}} sent on a combat {{deployment}} {{as part of}} the Australian contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. During the invasion, 14 Hornets flew patrols over Iraq, as well as close air support sorties to assist coalition ground forces. RAAF F/A-18s also provided security for the <b>American</b> <b>air</b> base at Diego Garcia between late 2001 and early 2002, and have protected a number of high-profile events in Australia. Between 2015 and 2017 a detachment of Hornets was deployed to the Middle East and struck ISIL targets as part of Operation Okra.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{consisted}} of <b>American</b> <b>air</b> raids against Japanese military installations on Formosa (Taiwan) {{during the day}} and Japanese air attacks at night against American ships. Japanese losses exceeded 300 planes destroyed in the air, while American losses amounted to fewer than 100 aircraft destroyed and two cruisers damaged. This outcome effectively deprived the Japanese Navy's Combined Fleet of air cover for future operations, which proved decisive during the Battle of Leyte Gulf later in October.|$|E

5|$|The simple {{appearance}} of MiGs could often accomplish their mission by causing American pilots to jettison their bomb loads {{as a defensive}} measure. In 1966, the MiG-17 were joined by more modern Soviet-built MiG-21 Fishbeds, which could fight on a more equal footing with the U.S. aircraft. By 1967, the North Vietnamese Air Force was maintaining an interceptor force of 100 aircraft, {{many of which were}} based on PRC airfields and out of reach of <b>American</b> <b>air</b> attack.|$|E

5|$|<b>American</b> <b>air,</b> artillery, mortar, and {{tank fire}} now {{concentrated}} on Battle Mountain, and I and L Companies prepared another counterattack to retake it. This attack launched soon after, but made slow progress and at midnight it halted {{to wait for}} daylight. Shortly after dawn on August 22, I and L Companies resumed the attack. L Company moved up the mountain, with I Company supplying a base of fire. Three North Korean grenades wounded six of the troops, causing the rest to retreat without orders from their frustrated commander. They were eventually returned to the hill with some coercion. A few hours later, when a small North Korean force worked around its right flank, the company again withdrew back {{down the hill to}} I Company's position without orders.|$|E
