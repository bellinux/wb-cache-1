Where there are far-side bus stops, an <b>advance</b> <b>signal</b> does not provide any benefit to the bus because {{it will not be}} able to merge into traffic during the <b>advance</b> <b>signal</b> phase. Where near-side stops are present, an <b>advance</b> <b>signal</b> can be highly effective in giving the bus a head start, however the bus {{stop location}} needs to consider the detection strategy used for the <b>advance</b> <b>signal</b> phase so that the bus is detected only after it is done serving the bus stop.It is preferable to provide a receiving lane on the far side of the intersection to provide an acceleration/merging area, however this is not always a requirement when an <b>advance</b> <b>signal</b> is used.|$|E

50|$|When an <b>advance</b> <b>signal</b> is used, {{it should}} be {{actuated}} by an approaching bus to avoid needlessly delaying other traffic {{when there is no}} bus present. If the queue jump lane is designated as bus-only, then standard traffic signal detection such as loop detectors or video detection can be used. If there is a limited amount of other traffic in the lane, then two or more loop detectors can be used and configured with AND logic such that only a long vehicle will actuate the advance phase. If the queue jump lane is shared with a higher volume of other traffic, a more high-tech detection scheme may be needed such as Opticom or RFID. Queue jump advance phases are typically 5-10 seconds in duration; longer time may be needed if multiple buses or right turning traffic need to be flushed through the queue jump in one signal cycle. Pedestrian phases can generally run concurrent with a queue jump phase {{as long as there are}} no protected turn phases also running with the queue jump phase.|$|E

Performance comparison of WPT and EMD is done for the envelope analysis of the optimal wavelet packet and the IMF (Intrinsic Mode Function) component that can extract salient features of the four compressor conditions including one normal and three fault conditions (intercooler leakage, discharge valve leakage and the combination of intercooler and discharge valve leakage). Harmonic changes produced after envelope analysis of the best packet and IMF component are used for classification and results show that WPT technique is more robust and effective in fault classification compared to EMD...|$|E

Clutter and terrain features such as trees and buildings were modelled to closely represent the real environment to enhance the accuracy of the Signal Strength prediction. The key pillar of this approach is its ability to establish the contribution of each of the localised features to the propagation model. Based on the magnitude of the contribution of each feature, a conclusive correction factor for each feature was obtained. The proposed system is evaluated using field measurements collected from a Global System for Mobile communication network in diverse geographic locations in the outskirts of Pretoria.

Vibration analysis has been used as a predictive maintenance procedure and as a support for machinery maintenance decisions. In this present work monitoring of gear health using the vibration signals as well as usage of <b>advance</b> <b>signal</b> processing methods such as wavelet transform is implemented to extract the features which reveals the characteristics of the actual conditions of the gear. By meas-uring and analysing the signals, it is possible to determine both the nature and severity of the defect, and hence predict the ma-chine’s failure. To reduce the dimensionality of the extracted statistical features, roughset integrated principle component analysis (RSPCA) is used after feature extraction process. Back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and probabilistic neural network (PNN) were deployed for diagnostic analysis of the sig-nal.

40|$|Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) {{is one of}} {{the widely}} used remote sensing sensors which {{produces}} high resolution image by using <b>advance</b> <b>signal</b> processing technique. SAR managed to operate in all sorts of weather and cover wide range of area. To produce a high-quality image, accurate parameters such as Doppler centroid are required for precise SAR signal processing. In the azimuth matched filtering of SAR signal processing, Doppler centroid is an important azimuth parameter that helps to focus the image pixels. Doppler centroid has always been overlooked during SAR signal processing. It {{is due to the fact}} that estimation of Doppler centroid involved complicated calculation and increased computational load. Therefore, researcher used to apply only the approximate Doppler value which is not precise and cause defocus effort in the generated SAR image. In this study, several conventional Doppler centroid estimation algorithms are reviewed and developed using Matlab software program to extract the Doppler parameter from received SAR data, namely Spectrum Fit Algorithm, Wavelength Diversity Algorithm (WDA), Multilook Cross Correlation Algorithm (MLCC), and Multilook Beat Frequency Algorithm (MLBF). Two sets of SAR data are employed to evaluate the performance of each estimator, i. e. simulated point target data and RADARSAT- 1 Vancouver scene raw data. These experiments gave a sense of accuracy for the estimated results together with computational time consumption.

40|$|AbstractThere exist a {{large group}} of {{structures}} like e. g. aircraft, which operational safety requires periodical inspections or even continuous monitoring of its health. Sometimes the structures are equipped with Structural Health Monitoring systems which usually utilizes the phenomena of elastic waves propagation in solids. The analysis of elastic waves signals consists in general of quantitative and qualitative description of theirs changes (e. g. attenuation, distortion, reflection) caused by a damage appearance and growth. Since the reflections and dispersion effects may produce pretty complex signals, therefore the determination of parameters suitable for damage detection requires the application of <b>advance</b> <b>signal</b> processing techniques. For this purpose an approach of novelty detection and damage evaluation based on soft computing methods (for example - Neural Networks) was proposed in this paper. Two levels of the damage identification problem were realized: novelty detection and damage assessment. The system accuracy and reliability were verified during laboratory tests. It was proved that the system can be used for the analysis of simple as well as complex signals. One of the important factors in the structural health monitoring systems is the amount of data that need to be analysed in real time. This study investigated the use of artificially deteriorated signals of elastic waves in training the novelty detection (ND) system. In this system auto-associative neural networks were trained using the principal components calculated on the basis of experimentally measured signals. It was found that the designed ND system remained sensitive and robust even when it uses raw signals with a relatively low sampling rate, on a fairly narrow time window and even noisy signals...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to develop a leading indicator of external debt servicing vulnerability that would serve as an <b>advance</b> <b>signal</b> of payments interruption. The traditional and widely used ratios of debt servicing capacity, such as the ratio of the balance on current account of debt service payment, and the ratio of external debt to exports among others, primarily measure a country’s current capacity to handle its international obligations. However, they fail to test the vulnerability to debtor countries to oncoming debt servicing problems, or to signal in advance an imminent situation of payments interruption. The proposed index combines a number of variables which have preceded payments interruption by a number of countries in recent years. These situations have been preceded with a varying time lead by all or most of the following developments: 1. A significant erosion in the international liquidity position. 2. A sharply faster growth rate of external debt than the rate of growth in export earnings. 3. An acceleration in the inflation rate experienced by the country. 4. A shortfall in exports or a deterioration in export performance. 5. Adverse internal political developments. The complied index is a weighted average of sub-indices or ratios which measure recent changes in the variables listed above. The index was applied to 20 developing countries (LDCs) accounting for about 80 percent of total external debt. Depending on their score, these countries were grouped in five categories ranging from those signaling significant improvement in their debt servicing capacity to those signaling an imminent payments interruption. © 1985 JIBS.
