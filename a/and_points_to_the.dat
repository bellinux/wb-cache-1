5|$|The second barcarolle, {{dedicated}} to the pianist Marie Poitevin, is a longer and more ambitious work than the first, with what Morrison calls an Italianate profusion of detail. Duchen writes of the work as complex and questing, harmonically and melodically, <b>and</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> influence of Saint-Saëns, Liszt and even, unusually for Fauré, of Wagner. The work opens in 6/8 time like the first, but Fauré varies the time signature to an unexpected 9/8 {{in the middle of}} the piece.|$|E
25|$|The early {{influence}} of Wagner on Parry's {{music can be}} heard in the Concertstück for orchestra (1877), the overture Guillem de Cabestanh (1878), and especially in Scenes from Prometheus Unbound (1880). Dibble notes a more thoroughly absorbed Wagnerian influence in Blest Pair of Sirens, <b>and</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{influence of}} Brahms on such works as the Piano Quartet in A flat (1879) and the Piano Trio in B minor (1884).|$|E
25|$|Nisia {{dances and}} soon captivates the amorous king. He tries to embrace her, but she eludes him. Meanwhile, Pythia watches behind a curtain <b>and</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{poisoned}} cup. Nisia takes it and presents it to Candaules with averted eyes. The King drains the cup. He feels {{the effects of}} the poison and strikes a gong, but Pythia appears. As Candaules writhes in the throes of death, Gyges and his courtiers rush in. Gyges goes to help the King, but Pythia forces him to confess that Gyges is the rightful monarch. Gyges takes the King's crown and presents it to Nisia who, surprised, looks at Pythia, who reminds her of her prediction.|$|E

25|$|The team {{reported}} that they had been able to identify compound nuclei fissioning with half-lives > 10−18 s. This result suggests a strong stabilizing effect at Z=124 <b>and</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next proton shell at Z>120, not at Z=114 as previously thought. A compound nucleus is a loose combination of nucleons that have not arranged themselves into nuclear shells yet. It has no internal structure and is held together only by the collision forces between the target and projectile nuclei. It is estimated that it requires around 10−14s for the nucleons to arrange themselves into nuclear shells, at which point the compound nucleus becomes a nuclide, and this number is used by IUPAC as the minimum half-life a claimed isotope must have to potentially be recognised as being discovered. Thus, the GANIL experiments do not count as a discovery of element 124.|$|E
25|$|Above the Sovereign, {{the second}} tier {{contains}} the icons {{of the twelve}} great feasts. There are two large icons above the Royal Door, that divide the three central tiers of the iconostasis into two equal parts. Six icons, related {{to the life of}} Mary, appear {{on the left side of}} the Feasts tier. These icons depict scenes related to Mary. On the far left there is the Nativity of the Theotokos, which has Saint Anne sitting in the center, holding the newborn Mary on her lap. An angel holds a wreath of glory above them, and the Holy Spirit shines in the shape of the Eye of Providence on the top of the composition. The Greek Catholic Church celebrates Mary's birth on September 8. The second icon from the left depicts the Presentation of Mary, celebrated on November 21. This is the feast with which the cathedral was associated. In the painting the child Mary steps forward to Zechariah, the priest of the temple in Jerusalem. The next image illustrates the scene of the Annunciation, when Gabriel visits the Virgin Mary to announce to her that she is conceived with Jesus. Gabriel holds a white lily in his left hand, <b>and</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sky with his right. The beam of light, coming down from God via the dove of the Holy Spirit onto Mary, symbolizes that the Holy Virgin became pregnant by God himself through the Holy Spirit. The Annunciation is celebrated nine months before the birth of Jesus, on March 25. The next icon depicts the Visitation, when Mary visits her cousin, Elizabeth, who is pregnant with John the Baptist. Traditionally the icon of the Visitation portrays the two pregnant women, Mary and Elizabeth hugging each other. In Hajdúdorog this scene is quite different: Elizabeth does not even appear in the painting. Mary, on the right, brings two white doves in a basket as gifts to her cousin. The family members introduce the newborn John to her. March 31 is the feast day of the Visitation. The fifth icon on the tier is the flight to Egypt. This is the only scene on the Feasts tier which cannot be associated with any religious feast. Joseph leaves Bethlehem with Mary and Jesus after learning that King Herod wants to massacre all the newborns in Judea. The last icon on the Marian part of the Feasts tier is the Dormition, the death of Mary. The Holy Virgin, in a white shroud, lies in the center of the image. Jesus casts light on his mother from Heaven as a symbol of her eternal life and her assumption. The Greek Catholic Church commemorates Mary's death on August 15.|$|E
500|$|The second nocturne {{opens with}} a bell-like passage, andantino espressivo, recalling – {{although}} Fauré said it was unconscious – the sound of distant bells that he heard frequently when a boy. Nectoux singles out [...] "the light footed episode in alternating fifths and sixths" [...] and its extremely delicate passagework, <b>and</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> influence of Fauré's former teacher Saint-Saëns in the allegro ma non troppo toccata section. Saint-Saëns himself declared the piece [...] "absolutely entrancing." ...|$|E
5|$|Schneiderman {{described}} Trump University as a bait-and-switch scheme <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that}} the organization was not a university. He accused Trump of misleading more than 5,000 people to pay up to $35,000 to learn his real estate investment techniques.|$|R
25|$|Bragman, like others, {{notes that}} the moth is not a {{quarantine}} pest in Europe, <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> recent research papers by Harder and Carey that he believes constitute technical and scientific information which should be conveyed to trade representatives.|$|R
25|$|The county's {{coat of arms}} {{comprises}} three Saxon seax knives (although {{they look}} rather more like scimitars), mainly white <b>and</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right (sic), arranged vertically one above another on a red background (Gules three Seaxes fessewise in pale Argent pomels <b>and</b> hilts Or <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sinister <b>and</b> cutting edges upwards); the three-seax device is also used as the official logo of Essex County Council having been granted as such in 1932.|$|R
500|$|Film {{historian}} Joseph McBride considered O'Hara's {{performance to}} have been the most powerful and intense emotionally he'd seen since Katharine Hepburn in Mary of Scotland (1936). O'Hara stated that her favorite scene in the film took place outside the church after her character gets married, remarking, [...] "I make my way down the steps to the carriage waiting below, the wind catches my veil and fans it out in a perfect circle all the way around my face. Then it floats straight up above my head <b>and</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heavens. It's breathtaking." ...|$|E
500|$|Snyder (originally Snyderville) is a hamlet {{within the}} town of Amherst in Erie County, New York, United States {{that is part of}} the Buffalo – Niagara Falls {{metropolitan}} area. [...] The hamlet was established in 1837. It was named for Michael Snyder, its first postmaster, who also operated a store at the corner of Harlem Road, which is also known as New York State Route 240, and Main Street, which is also known as New York State Route 5. The hamlet blossomed due to retail activity demand created along the Main Street transportation route between Buffalo <b>and</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east in the 19th and early 20th century.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} notable {{in that it}} was the first episode of the series to confirm Agent Scully's cancer. Reportedly, when Chris Carter {{informed}} Gillian Anderson that her character would be diagnosed with cancer, she was [...] "delighted" [...] that {{she would be able to}} play her character in a different way. John Shiban considers the episode to be [...] "a great X-Files story" [...] and very important because it established the story-arc featuring Scully's cancer. However, the audience receives an early indication of Scully's cancer in the episode [...] "Unruhe" [...] (which aired earlier in the same season, also written by Vince Gilligan), when Gerry Schnauz kidnaps her in the episode and says he can see Scully's [...] "unrest", <b>and</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bridge of her nose–exactly where her cancer would be.|$|E

40|$|Failure in the {{peristaltic}} {{mechanism that}} conducts urine from <b>the</b> kidney <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bladder {{can lead to}} hydronephrosis, a common birth defect associated with obstructive nephropathy. New animal models reveal molecular pathways important for peristalsis <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> central role of the renal pelvis in urine transport...|$|R
500|$|Pursued by {{the priests}} {{in a car}} chase that leads them through a {{shopping}} mall, Lois and Peter escape from the priests and drive to a cornfield where Peter buries the film. While he is doing so, the priests fly down in a crop-duster and kidnap Lois. Peter is then given a message telling {{him that if he}} does not return the film to Gibson at his estate on top of Mount Rushmore, his wife will be killed. Peter arrives at the house and gives Gibson a film can. As Peter and Lois are about to leave, Gibson discovers that the film has been replaced with dog feces, leading to a chase {{on the face of the}} mountain. While being chased, Lois slips but hangs on to George Washington's lips. Peter grabs her and, while being held at gunpoint, he tells Gibson that the film [...] "is in President Rushmore's mouth" [...] <b>and</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other side of the monument. Gibson follows Peter's direction and falls off the edge as Peter pulls Lois to safety. Upon climbing back to the top of the mountain, the two have sexual intercourse there, improving their marriage.|$|E
2500|$|The German {{anthropologist}} Hans Peter Duerr briefly {{discussed the}} benandanti {{in his book}} [...] (1978, English translation 1985). Like Ginzburg before him, he compared them to the Perchtenlaufen and the Livonian werewolf, arguing that they all represented a clash between the forces of order and chaos. Gábor Klaniczay argued that the benandanti {{were part of a}} wider survival of pre-Christian rites, <b>and</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> survival of broadly similar practices (differing in both names and minor details) in the Balkans, Hungary and Romania during the same period.|$|E
2500|$|Pottery {{found in}} {{sedentary}} sites includes the hand-made [...] "porous" [...] type, grey wheel-made ware, red-fired pottery and imported Roman ware. Bichir describes {{the first two}} as continuing Dacian La Tène pottery, <b>and</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> presence of the so-called [...] "Dacian cup", a cup of distinctive design, as evidence of a Dacian base to this culture. However, he admits that the pottery also shows Roman and Sarmatian influence. The sedentary folk {{appear to have been}} generally illiterate, as no [...] "Daco-Carpic" [...] inscription was ever found during the very intensive excavations carried out in the region.|$|E
2500|$|A Spokesman Review article {{states that}} Schuckardt claimed <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> only true Catholic bishop. Schuckardt's {{officials}} deny {{that he ever}} made such a claim, <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that he directed his clergy to diligently search for Roman Catholic Bishops that might qualify as legitimate in his eyes.|$|R
5|$|Indigenous people {{assert that}} their {{sovereign}} rights are valid, <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Royal Proclamation of 1763, which is {{mentioned in the}} Canadian Constitution Act, 1982, Section 25, the British North America Acts and the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (to which Canada is a signatory) {{in support of this}} claim.|$|R
25|$|Many {{scholars}} have provided excellent commentaries on Makin's An Essay. While {{some of the}} criticism on Makin considers her work too conventional to be wholly classified as feminist, Nancy Weitz (Miller), Mitzi Myers, James L. Helm, and Frances Teague provide analyses of Makin's rhetorical methods <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> effectiveness of Makin's pro-education argument.|$|R
2500|$|Elisabeth enters, {{alarmed at}} the {{apparent}} theft of her jewel casket. However, the King produces it <b>and</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> portrait of Don Carlos which it contains, accusing her of adultery. She protests her innocence but, when the King threatens her, she faints. In {{response to his}} calls for help, into the chamber come Eboli and Posa. Their laments of suspicion cause the King {{to realize that he}} has been wrong to suspect his wife ("Maudit soit le soupçon infâme" [...] / [...] "Ah, sii maledetto, sospetto fatale"). Aside, Posa resolves to save Carlos, though it may mean his own death. Eboli feels remorse for betraying Elisabeth; the latter, recovering, expresses her despair.|$|E
2500|$|Alternatives to categorizing {{intersex}} {{conditions as}} [...] "disorders" [...] have been suggested, including [...] "variations of sex development". Organisation Intersex International (OII) questions a disease/disability approach, argues for deferral of intervention unless medically necessary, when fully informed {{consent of the}} individual involved is possible, and self-determination of sex/gender orientation and identity. The UK Intersex Association is also {{highly critical of the}} label 'disorders' <b>and</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that there was minimal involvement of intersex representatives in the debate which led to the change in terminology. In May 2016, Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth also published a statement opposing pathologizing language to describe people born with intersex traits, recognizing [...] "increasing general understanding and acceptance of the term [...] "intersex"".|$|E
2500|$|Dawkins now {{describes}} {{the history of}} scientific knowledge of echolocation, <b>and</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cumulative build-up of corroborating evidence for scientific explanations of the phenomena. He visits psychologist Chris French, who is performing a double-blind test of dowsing. None of the dowsers perform better, in a statistically significant sense, than is expectable by chance alone. While the dowsers are surprised, Dawkins and French note that their confidence is untouched, and they prefer explanations (French states some may call them excuses) that retain the hypothesis that they have paranormal dowsing powers. Dawkins next attempts his own explanation of belief in the paranormal in a combination of evolutionary and psychological terms, saying: [...] "we don’t want to believe things just happen", and he suggests superstition is {{just the sort of}} animal error committed by Skinner’s pigeons.|$|E

2500|$|There {{have also}} been {{arguments}} that the Great Recession of the early 21st century was caused not by excessively free markets but by the remnants of Keynesian policy. Luigi Zingales of the University of Chicago argued that [...] "Keynesianism is just a convenient ideology to hide corruption and political patronage". In February 2009, Alan Reynolds, {{senior fellow at the}} Cato Institute, acknowledged the Keynesian resurgence, but stated that evidence from various studies suggest Keynesian remedies will be ineffective and Keynesian advocates appear to be driven by blind faith. In 2009, historian Thomas Woods, an adherent to the Austrian school of economics, published the book Meltdown, which places blame for the crisis on government intervention <b>and</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Federal Reserve as the primary culprit behind the financial calamity.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{criticism}} about the [...] "sparse" [...] level of coverage and [...] "little interest" [...] {{given to the}} demonstrations by the international media, the protests were hailed by some commentators as [...] "momentous events" [...] in Tunisian history. Brian Whitaker, writing in The Guardian, suggested on 28 December 2010, that the protests {{would be enough to}} bring an end to Ben Ali's presidency and noted similarities with the protests that led to the end of Nicolae Ceauşescu's reign in Romania in 1989, although Steven Cook, writing for the Council of Foreign Relations, notes that a tipping point is only obvious after the fact, <b>and</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> counter-example of the 2009-2010 Iranian election protests. Ben Ali's governing strategy was nevertheless regarded as in serious trouble, and Elliot Abrams noted both that demonstrators were able for the first time at the end of 2010 to defy the security forces and that the regime had no obvious successors outside of Ben Ali's own family.|$|E
2500|$|The Roman Rite Anointing of the Sick, as revised in 1972, puts greater stress {{than in the}} {{immediately}} preceding centuries on the sacrament's {{aspect of}} healing, <b>and</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> place sickness holds in the normal life of Christians and its part in the redemptive work of the Church. Canon law permits its administration to any Catholic who has reached the use of reason and is beginning {{to be put in}} danger by illness or old age, unless the person in question obstinately persists in a manifestly grave sin. [...] "If there is any doubt as to whether the sick person has reached the use of reason, or is dangerously ill, or is dead, this sacrament is to be administered". There is an obligation to administer it to the sick who, when they were in possession of their faculties, at least implicitly asked for it. A new illness or a renewal or worsening of the first illness enables a person to receive the sacrament a further time.|$|E
25|$|Joe Nickell {{argues that}} results similar to Heller and Adler's could be {{obtained}} from tempera paint. Skeptics also cite other forensic blood tests whose results dispute the authenticity of <b>the</b> Shroud, <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> possibility that the blood could belong to a person handling the shroud, and that the apparent blood flows on the shroud are unrealistically neat.|$|R
