40|$|Jazz <b>and</b> <b>rock</b> {{have been}} {{historically}} treated as separate musical traditions, despite having many similar musical and cultural characteristics, {{as well as}} sharing significant periods of interaction and overlap throughout popular music history. The rift between jazz <b>and</b> <b>rock,</b> <b>and</b> jazz <b>and</b> <b>rock</b> scholarship, {{is based on a}} set of received assumptions as to why jazz <b>and</b> <b>rock</b> are different. However, these assumptions are not naturally inherent to the two genres, but are instead the result of a discursive construction that defines them in contrast to one another. Furthermore, the roots of this discursive divide {{are to be found in}} the history of popular music journalism. In this thesis I challenge the traditional divide between jazz <b>and</b> <b>rock</b> by examining five historical case studies in American jazz <b>and</b> <b>rock</b> journalism. My underlying argument is that we cannot take for granted the fact that jazz <b>and</b> <b>rock</b> would ultimately become separate discourses: what are now represented as inevitable musical and cultural divergences between the two genres were actually constructed under very particular institutional and historical forces. There are other ways popular music history could have been written (and has been written) that call the oppositional representation of jazz <b>and</b> <b>rock</b> into question. The case studies focus on the two oldest surviving and most influential jazz <b>and</b> <b>rock</b> periodicals: Down Beat and Rolling Stone. I examine the role of critics in developing a distinction between the two genres that would eventually be reproduced in the academic scholarship of jazz <b>and</b> <b>rock.</b> I also demonstrate how the formation of jazz <b>and</b> <b>rock</b> as genres has been influenced by non-musicological factors, not least of all by music magazines as commercial institutions trying to survive and compete in the American press industry.

40|$|AbstractConstruction {{in urban}} areas implies use of {{construction}} materials from quarries and excavation of soil <b>and</b> <b>rock.</b> From a resource perspective, there could be benefits from using excavated soil <b>and</b> <b>rock</b> as a construction material. The aim {{of this paper is}} to describe the material flow and management practices of urban excavated soil <b>and</b> <b>rock</b> from the perspective of resource efficiency. A conceptual model for the urban flow of excavated soil <b>and</b> <b>rock</b> was developed <b>and</b> a literature review concerning the management of excavated soil <b>and</b> <b>rock</b> was conducted. The conceptual model was subsequently used to clarify the different perspectives of the scientific literature and knowledge gaps. Conclusions drawn are that there is little knowledge about the quantities and the fate of excavated soil <b>and</b> <b>rock</b> {{in urban areas}}. Current research is focusing on the waste flows of construction material and little is known about the overall management practices of excavated soil <b>and</b> <b>rock.</b> Clearly, excavated soil <b>and</b> <b>rock</b> are often disposed at landfills and the recycling rate for high quality purposes is low. There is a need to evaluate the potential for an increased use of excavated soil <b>and</b> <b>rock</b> as construction material. However, the overall efficiency of urban construction material management can only be evaluated and improved by also including construction materials produced in quarries...|$|R

The larvae then build new cases out of precious items, creating a unique form of artwork. The resulting works are sold across the world.|$|E
5|$|While most jumping spiders prey {{mainly on}} insects and by active hunting, females of Portia also build webs to catch prey directly.

A Portia often joins her own web on to one of a web-based non-salticid spider. When not joined to another spiders', a P. labiata female's capture web may be suspended from rigid foundations such as boughs <b>and</b> <b>rocks,</b> or from pliant bases such as stems of shrubs.|$|E

Thousands of people were forced from their homes as rivers rose, including upwards of 30,000fleeing for shelter after the Tuxpan River exceeded its bank. About 8,000residents of the city of Álamo were rendered homeless. Flooding in Poza Rica forced the rescue of dozens of people from their cars and homes. Several homes in the city were swept away, while debris such as tree branches and trash blocked water runoff. Water, mudslides, <b>and</b> <b>rocks</b> blocked numerous roads in the area.

About 5,000homes were flooded by September3, forcing approximately 30,000people to flee. Additional flooding in the town resulted in about 8,000people being left homeless. In Poza Rica, downed tree trunks and trash caused water runoffs to be blocked. Mud <b>and</b> <b>rocks</b> blocked roads and dozens were rescued from house and car flooding. A number of homes built along the gullies were washed away. The Cazones River overflowed, rendering a highway connecting Tampico to Veracruz impassable. The Cotaxtla River exceeded its bank in Cotaxtla, rupturing nine oil and natural gas lines. Pemex works quickly closed the pipelines. In Mexico City, about 600people fled for shelter as rivers in the area began to swell. Ramón Aguirre Velázquez, the Head of Government of Mexico City, described the rainfall as the heaviest in 20years.|$|E
5|$|Radon is a colorless and odorless gas {{generated}} by the breakdown of radioactive radium, {{which in turn is}} the decay product of uranium, found in the Earth's crust. The radiation decay products ionize genetic material, causing mutations that sometimes turn cancerous. Radon is the second-most common cause of lung cancer in the USA, causing about 21,000 deaths each year. The risk increases 8–16% for every 100 Bq/m³ increase in the radon concentration. Radon gas levels vary by locality and the composition of the underlying soil <b>and</b> <b>rocks.</b> About one in 15 homes in the US has radon levels above the recommended guideline of 4 picocuries per liter (pCi/l) (148 Bq/m³).|$|E

5|$|Reaching {{the top of}} the Halfaya Pass, the 22nd Guards Brigade group {{ran into}} heavy {{opposition}} from an Italian Bersaglieri infantry company, supported by anti-tank guns, under the command of Colonel Ugo Montemurro. This unit fought tenaciously, doing much to repair the poor impression Rommel had of his Italian allies. Opening fire upon the attacking British tanks, the Bersaglieri found their 47mm anti-tank guns to be unable to penetrate the armour of the Matilda infantry tanks. At , the gunners shifted targets. Now aiming at the tracks and undercarriages, when the tanks raised up crossing low stone walls <b>and</b> <b>rocks,</b> seven tanks were disabled. For his conduct during this action, Rommel recommended that Montemurro be awarded the Iron Cross First Class. At the cost of these seven tanks, the position was taken by CSquadron 4RTR and GCompany 2nd Scots Guards, and the brigade group pushed on towards the Bir Wair-Musaid road. At around 08:00, it received the surrender of a large German-Italian camp, and by 10:15 Bir Wair and Musaid had been taken in the face of limited opposition.|$|E
5|$|The 4th North Korean Division, meanwhile, had {{constructed}} underwater bridges of sandbags, logs, <b>and</b> <b>rocks,</b> finishing {{the first on}} August 10. 4th Division used it to move trucks and heavy artillery as well as additional infantry and a few tanks across the river. By the morning of August 10, an estimated two KPA regiments were across the river and occupying fortified positions. Supplies continued to stream in through rafts. Task Force Hill mounted its attack, but was once again unable to make progress due to the newly established artillery. Its directive to attack quickly became one to dig in and hold its ground, and by nightfall the entire 4th North Korean Division was across the river. On August 10, elements of 4th North Korean began to move south, outflanking Task Force Hill. The next day, scattered North Korean elements attacked Yongsan. KPA repeatedly attacked at night, when American soldiers were resting and had greater difficulty resisting.|$|E
