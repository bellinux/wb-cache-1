50|$|The NEX-VG10 is able {{to support}} all of E-mount lenses in {{addition}} to the kit lens. A 16 mm pancake and standard zoom 18-55 mm lens that comes with most Alpha NEX mirrorless cameras are fully supported. In addition a 0.62× converter <b>add-on</b> <b>lens</b> (giving a fish eye effect) will be able to work with the 16 mm pancake. There is a 0.75× wide-angle converter for the 16mm lens available. E-mount series of lenses will be fully supported with auto-focus. The optional LA-EA1 adapter allows the camera to use A-mount lenses, with auto-focus for SAM and SSM lenses. The more advanced adapter LA-EA2, announced on 24 August 2011, will make aufofocus available to all AF lenses. A wide range of adaptors are available for Nikon, Canon, etc. Any APS-C or full-frame 35 mm lens should in principle be usable on the camera, as the backfocus requirement is far less than for a SLR.|$|E
40|$|While Ocular Coherence Tomography (OCT) {{is not a}} {{first-line}} modality {{to evaluate}} anterior eye structures terrestrially, it is a resource already available on the International Space Station (ISS) {{that can be used}} in medical contingencies that involve the anterior eye. With remote guidance and subject matter expert (SME) support from the ground, a minimally trained crewmember can now use OCT to evaluate anterior eye pathologies on orbit. OCT utilizes low-coherence interferometry to produce detailed cross-sectional and 3 D images of the eye in real time. Terrestrially, it has been used to evaluate macular pathologies and glaucoma. Since 2013, OCT has been used onboard the ISS as one part of a suite of hardware to evaluate the Visual Impairment/Intracranial Pressure risk faced by astronauts, specifically assessing changes in the retina and choroid during space flight. The Anterior Segment Module (ASM), an <b>add-on</b> <b>lens,</b> was also flown for research studies, providing an opportunity to evaluate the anterior eye in real time if clinically indicated. Anterior eye pathologies that could be evaluated using OCT were identified. These included corneal abrasions and ulcers, scleritis, and acute angle closure glaucoma. A remote guider script was written to provide ground specialists with step-by-step instructions to guide ISS crewmembers, who do not get trained on the ASM, to evaluate the anterior eye. The instructions were tested on novice subjects and/or operators, whose feedback was incorporated iteratively. The final remote guider script was reviewed by SME optometrists and NASA flight surgeons. The novel application of OCT technology to space flight allows for the acquisition of objective data to diagnose anterior eye pathologies when other modalities are not available. This demonstrates the versatility of OCT and highlights the advantages of using existing hardware and remote guidance skills to expand clinical capabilities in space flight...|$|E
50|$|There {{were several}} <b>add-on</b> <b>lenses</b> {{released}} for the Kodak DC20. These included a macro adapter, a telephoto converter, and a wide-angle converter from Tiffen. These were clip-on lenses since the original lens had no thread. There {{was also an}} add-on photo flash unit made by Kodak.|$|R

5000|$|... 52mm filter {{screw mount}} on the lens - use this for {{screw-on}} filters {{that will not}} vignette the 24mm wide angle view (not higher than 5mm). Also for single element macro close up filters. For mounting heavier <b>add-on</b> <b>lenses</b> like the Kodak Xenar 1.4x tele converter (Kodak #8756488), use the 55 mm adapter tube (Kodak #8480485) - this attaches to a thread hidden by a chromed ring around the lens. This adapter cannot be left on permanently because it will cut off the angle of view {{for most of the}} zoom range.|$|R
5000|$|With SLR cameras, it is {{important}} that the image in the viewfinder be the same image recorded by the film or sensor, so that the effect of the <b>add-on</b> <b>lenses</b> and filters can be seen by the photographer. Point-and-shoot cameras generally don't have such add-on devices, hence there is no such need. [...] Small cameras, including digital ones, encourage the occurrence of photographic orbs [...] - [...] unexpected, typically circular artifacts that occur in flash photography [...] - [...] where the short distance between the lens and the built-in flash decreases the angle of light reflection to the lens. The resulting retroreflection makes dust particles bright and visible.|$|R

40|$|Ideally, {{neuronal}} functions {{would be}} studied by performing experiments with unconstrained animals whilst they behave {{in their natural}} environment. Although this is not feasible currently for most animal models, one can mimic the natural environment in the laboratory by using a virtual reality (VR) environment. Here we present a novel VR system based upon a spherical projection of computer generated images using a modified commercial data projector with an <b>add-on</b> fish-eye <b>lens.</b> This system provides equidistant visual stimulation with extensive coverage of the visual field, high spatio-temporal resolution and flexible stimulus generation using a standard computer. It also includes a track-ball system for closed-loop behavioural experiments with walking animals. We present {{a detailed description of}} the system and characterize it thoroughly. Finally, we demonstrate the VR system’s performance whilst operating in closed-loop conditions by showing the movement trajectories of the cockroaches during exploratory behaviour in a VR forest...|$|R
5000|$|Panavision used {{a second}} <b>add-on</b> adapter <b>lens</b> that {{was linked to}} the focus {{position}} of the prime lens. This changed the anamorphic ratio along with focus position, which resulted in the area of interest on-screen having a normal-looking geometry. Later cylindrical lens systems used two sets of anamorphic optics to achieve the required change in aspect ratio: one more robust [...] "squeeze" [...] system that was coupled with a slight expansion sub-system. The expansion sub-system was counter-rotated in relation to the main squeeze system, all in mechanical interlinkage with the focus mechanism of the prime lens. This combination changed the anamorphic ratio and minimized the effect of anamorphic mumps in the area of interest in the frame. Though these techniques were regarded as a fix for the anamorphic mumps, they were a compromise. Cinematographers still needed to be careful with their framing of the scene so that effects of the change in aspect ratio were not readily apparent.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the sulcus anatomy and possible correlations between sulcus diameter and white-to-white (WTW) diameter in pseudophakic eyes, data {{that may be}} important in the stability of <b>add-on</b> intraocular <b>lenses</b> (IOLs). SETTING: University Eye Hospital, Tuebingen, Germany. DESIGN: Case series. METHODS: In pseudophakic eyes, the axial length (AL) and horizontal WTW were measured by the IOLMaster device. Cross-sectional images were obtained with a 50 MHz ultrasound biomicroscope on the 4 meridians: vertical, horizontal (180 degrees), temporal oblique, and nasal oblique. Sulcus-to-sulcus (STS), angle-to-angle (ATA), and sclera-to-sclera (ScTSc) diameters were measured. The IOL optic diameter (6. 0 mm) served as a control. To test reliability, optic measurements were repeated 5 times in a subset of eyes. RESULTS: The vertical ATA and STS diameters were statistically significantly larger than the horizontal diameter (P=. 0328 and P=. 0216, respectively). There was {{no statistically significant difference}} in ScTSc diameters. A weak correlation was found between WTW and horizontal ATA (r = 0. 5766, P<. 0001) and between WTW and horizontal STS (r = 0. 5040, P=. 0002). No correlation was found between WTW and horizontal ScTSc (r = 0. 2217, P=. 1217). CONCLUSIONS: The sulcus anatomy had a vertical oval shape with the vertical meridian being the largest, but it also had variation {{in the direction of the}} largest meridian. The WTW measurements showed a weak correlation with STS. In pseudophakic eyes, Soemmerring ring or a bulky haptic may affect the ciliary sulcus anatomy...|$|R
50|$|Today, {{the small}} size of fully {{automatic}} camcorders with large view screens and long-life rechargeable batteries has reduced the housing size and made underwater videography an easy, fun activity for the diver. Low-cost wide-angle <b>lens</b> <b>add-ons</b> are available for many cameras and some can even be fitted outside the camera housing for versatile use. This lets the photographer get closer and make the subject clearer and also with fewer focusing and depth of field problems. Today cameras are more sensitive to low light conditions and make automatic color balancing adjustments. Nevertheless, deeper water videography still needs auxiliary light sources to bring out colors filtered out of sunlight by the distance it has travelled through water. The longest wavelengths of light are lost first (reds and yellows) leaving only a greenish or blue cast in deep water. Even a hand light will help show off some of the magnificent colors of a coral reef or other marine life if used during recording.|$|R
