Hence, the Field-Marshal was definitely not part of the most inner circle of the 20 July plotters. At the same time, however, he {{was more than just a}} mere sympathiser and paid for this with his life. He consequently deserves a firm place in the military resistance against Hitler to a greater extent than it has recently been acknowledged in academia and in public.|$|E

500|$|At 08:00 on {{the morning}} of 27 August, after a {{messenger}} sent by Khalid requested parley from Cave, the consul replied that he would only have salvation if he agreed to the terms of the ultimatum. At 08:30 a further messenger from Khalid declared that [...] "We have no intention of hauling down our flag <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> believe you would open fire on us"; Cave replied that [...] "We do not want to open fire, but unless you do as you are told we shall certainly do so." [...] At 08:55, having received no further word from the palace, aboard St George Rawson hoisted the signal [...] "prepare for action".|$|E
500|$|When he said Jesus again I couldn't take it, and for {{the only}} time in my life I was discourteous, which I regret to this day.

[...] I felt all of a sudden so embarrassed. I closed my notebook and went to the elevator. He ran after me. He pulled me back; he sat down in his chair, and I in mine, and he began weeping.... And then, at the end, without saying anything, he simply said, [...] "You know, maybe you should talk about it." ...|$|E
500|$|However, the Singapore Court of Appeal {{dismissed}} {{the applicability of}} both cases {{on the ground that}} the terms of Article 14 of the Constitution differ materially from Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which was relied upon by the court in Lingens; as well as the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which were relied upon by the court in New York Times. The public figure doctrine was thus expressly rejected by the Court. Thean J. said: [...] "Such criticisms or attacks must, in our opinion, respect the bounds set by the law of defamation, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> accept that the publication of false and defamatory allegations, {{even in the absence of}} actual malice on the part of the publisher, should be allowed to pass with impunity." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{circumstances}} of the sinking were featured by a BBC programme. According to this, the despatch of Gloucester, alone and low on fuel and anti-aircraft ammunition (less than 20% remaining), into danger was a [...] "grievous error". Furthermore, the failure to attempt to rescue survivors after dark was [...] "contrary to usual Navy practice". A survivor commented [...] "The tradition in the Navy is that when a ship has sunk, a vessel is sent back to pick up survivors under cover of darkness. That did not happen <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> know why. We were picked up by Germans." [...] On 30 May 1941, {{in a letter to}} the First Sea Lord, Sir Dudley Pound, Cunningham wrote, [...] "The sending back of Gloucester and Fiji to the Greyhound was another grave error and cost us those two ships. They were practically out of ammunition but even had they been full up I think they would have gone. The Commanding Officer of Fiji told me that the air over Gloucester was black with planes." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{inclusion}} of [...] "Do You Wanna Touch Me (Oh Yeah)" [...] in an episode dealing with sex education and adolescent sexuality sparked some controversy, as its original performer and writer, Gary Glitter, {{is a registered}} sex offender in the United Kingdom. He has been convicted of several sexual crimes involving minors, including a conviction for possession of child pornography in the UK in 1997, and his conviction for child sexual abuse in Vietnam in 2005. Charities dedicated to serving and helping children have filed complaints to Fox and the producers of Glee. Television executives in the UK, where the episode was to be broadcast about a month later than in the US, were rumored to be considering {{the removal of the}} scene entirely. However, a spokesperson for Channel 4 stated that the episode would air in full, and explained: [...] "The scene is editorially justified within the programme <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> seek to censor material in the proper context." [...] Claude Knights, {{the executive director of the}} London-based children's charity Kidscape, said, [...] "It is regrettable that the producers did not consider the implication of using such a track in the context of a sex education class. The fact that this song is linked to Gary Glitter ... make it wholly inappropriate". The UK edition of Glee: The Music, Volume5 omits the track; [...] "Afternoon Delight" [...] is included instead.|$|E
500|$|On January 28, 2008, Radar Online {{reported}} that the Church of Scientology asked the U.S. Attorney General's office in Los Angeles, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Los Angeles Police Department to start a criminal investigation of possible criminal activity related to the DDoS attacks. An unnamed source told Radar that the Church of Scientology argued to law enforcement that the Internet attacks are a form of [...] "illegal interference with business." [...] Radar also {{reported that}} in statements to law enforcement the Church of Scientology emphasized {{its status as a}} religious organization in the United States in order to assert that the DDoS attacks can be classed as hate crimes. The day after the Church of Scientology complained to law enforcement about the DDoS attacks, one of the main Project Chanology sites was down, and a message on the site said that their site crashed due to attacks from Scientologists. In a statement issued to Wikinews, a Church of Scientology employee confirmed that actions of Anonymous had been reported to law enforcement: [...] "Activities of Anonymous have been reported to the Authorities and actions are being taken. Their activities are illegal <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> approve of them. At the same time, our main work is to improve the environment, make people more able and spiritually aware. ... yes, we are taking action." ...|$|E

500|$|During an {{interview}} with the Chilean newspaper La Tercera in October 2010, de la Rocha allegedly confirmed that a new album was in the works, with a possibility of a 2011 release. De la Rocha is reported as saying, [...] "We are all bigger and more mature <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> fall into the problems we faced 10 or 15 years ago. This is different and we project a lot: we are working on a new album due out next year, perhaps summer for the northern hemisphere". However, in early May 2011, guitarist Tom Morello said that the band were not working on a new album, but would not rule out the possibility of future studio work. [...] "The band is not writing songs, the band is not in the studio", Morello told The Pulse of Radio. [...] "We get along famously and we all, you know, intend to do more Rage Against the Machine stuff in the future, but beyond sort of working out a concert this year, there's nothing else on the schedule (for 2011)". The band created its own festival, the L.A. Rising. As Morello stated, the only Rage Against the Machine appearance for 2011 was a performance on July 30 at the L.A. Rising festival with El Gran Silencio, Immortal Technique, Lauryn Hill, Rise Against and Muse. As of mid-2012, there are no plans for any more shows. During {{an interview}} on July 30, 2011, Commerford seemingly contradicted Morello's comments, stating that new material was being written, and specific plans {{for the next two years}} were in place.|$|E
