25|$|DHT signals {{mainly in}} an intracrine and paracrine manner in the tissues {{in which it}} is produced, playing only a minor role, if any, as a {{circulating}} endocrine hormone. Circulating levels of DHT are 1/10th and 1/20th those of testosterone in terms of total and free concentrations, respectively, whereas local DHT levels may be up to 10times those of testosterone in tissues with high 5α-reductase expression such as the prostate gland. In addition, unlike testosterone, DHT is inactivated by 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD) into the very weak androgen 3α-androstanediol in various tissues such as muscle, adipose, and liver among others, and in relation to this, has been reported to be a very poor <b>anabolic</b> <b>agent</b> when given exogenously.|$|E

50|$|<b>Anabolic</b> <b>agents,</b> or <b>Anabolic</b> Androgenic Steroids (AAS), {{are any of}} a {{group of}} {{synthetic}} or natural steroid hormones that builds muscle by mimicking or increasing male-producing characteristics, such as testosterones. <b>Anabolic</b> <b>agents</b> are abused by athletes in training to increase the size and strength of their muscles. However, the muscle growth only occurs when combined with rigorous physical training. Examples of <b>anabolic</b> <b>agents</b> are boldenone, clenbuterol, dehydrocholormethyl-testosterone (DHEA), nandrolone, stanozolol, testosterone, methasterone, androstenedione, norandrostenedione, methandienone, etiocholanolone, and trenbolone.|$|R

40|$|Osteoporosis {{results from}} a loss of bone mass and bone {{structure}} such that the bone becomes weak and fractures with very little trauma. Until recently, the approved osteoporosis therapies prevented more bone loss by altering osteoclast activity and lifespan.

50|$|Mesterolone is {{described}} as a very poor <b>anabolic</b> <b>agent</b> due to inactivation by 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD) in skeletal muscle tissue, similarly to DHT and mestanolone (17α-methyl-DHT). In contrast, testosterone is a very poor substrate for 3α-HSD, and so is not similarly inactivated in skeletal muscle.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{inactivation}} by 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD) in skeletal muscle, mestanolone {{is described}} as a very poor <b>anabolic</b> <b>agent,</b> similarly to DHT.

40|$|Growth and {{development}} of domestic livestock for red meat production are often discussed {{in the context of}} environmental factors, nutritional requirements, genetic potential and the <b>anabolic</b> <b>agents</b> affecting production efficiency. In this minireview, the effects of endogenous and exogenous hormones on animal growth are reviewed. The pituitary, pancreatic and gonadal hormones known to affect growth and(or) carcass composition are cited to illustrate and place into perspective the important contributions that the endocrine system makes to animal production. Manipulation of endogenous hormones through 1) administration of synthetic releasing and inhibiting peptides and 2) immunoneutralization techniques, will likely provide the livestock producer with new technological approaches for increasing red meat production. Researchers continue to evaluate the efficacy of natural and synthetic steroids, and combinations thereof, as suitable <b>anabolic</b> <b>agents.</b> In conclusion, several hormones of both endogenous and exogenous origin can be manipulated to improve or enhance growth {{and development}} of the meat-producing animal...|$|R

5000|$|Unlike {{testosterone}} {{and various}} other AAS, androstanolone cannot be aromatized, and for this reason, poses no risk of estrogenic side effects like gynecomastia at any dosage. In addition, androstanolone cannot be metabolized by 5α-reductase (as it is already 5α-reduced), and for this reason, is not potentiated in so-called [...] "androgenic" [...] tissues like the skin, hair follicles, and prostate gland, thereby improving its ratio of anabolic to androgenic effects. However, androstanolone is nonetheless described as a very poor <b>anabolic</b> <b>agent.</b> This is attributed to its high affinity as a substrate for 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD), which is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and inactivates androstanolone into 3α-androstanediol, a metabolite with very weak AR activity. Unlike androstanolone, testosterone is very resistant to metabolism by 3α-HSD, and so is not similarly inactivated in skeletal muscle.|$|E
40|$|According to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Prohibited List, <b>anabolic</b> <b>agents</b> {{consist of}} {{exogenous}} anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS), endogenous AAS and other <b>anabolic</b> <b>agents</b> such as clenbuterol and selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs). Currently employed strategies for their improved detection include the prolongation of the detection windows for exogenous AAS, non-targeted and indirect analytical approaches {{for the detection}} of modified steroids (designer steroids), the athlete’s biological passport and isotope ratio mass spectrometry {{for the detection of}} the misuse of endogenous AAS, as well as preventive doping research for the detection of SARMs. The recent use of these strategies led to 4 – 80 -fold increases of adverse analytical findings for exogenous AAS, to the detection of the misuse of new designer steroids, to adverse analytical findings of different endogenous AAS and to the first adverse analytical findings of SARMs. The strategies of the antidoping research are not only focused on the development of methods to catch the cheating athlete but also to protect the clean athlete from inadvertent doping. Within the past few years several sources of inadvertent doping with <b>anabolic</b> <b>agents</b> have been identified. Among these are nutritional supplements adulterated with AAS, meat products contaminated with clenbuterol, mycotoxin (zearalenone) contamination leading to zeranol findings, and natural products containing endogenous AAS. The protection strategy consists of further investigations in case of reasonable suspicion of inadvertent doping, publication of the results, education of athletes and development of methods to differentiate between intentional and unintentional doping...|$|R

40|$|Osteoporosis is {{a chronic}} {{disease of the}} osseous system {{characterized}} by decreased bone strength and increased fracture risk. It is due to an imbalance in the dynamic ongoing processes of bone formation and bone resorption.
