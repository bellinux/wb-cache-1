The publisher paid £18 each for these which included writing about 50 jokes, illustrating them, and producing the cover. <b>After</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> first joke book, probably Laughter for the Home Front, solo, McLoughlin enlisted the aid of his brother Colin (b. 2 November 1925) with the writing chore. Thus began a working relationship between the McLoughlin brothers that would last at least into the 1950s and that produced New Laughs for All, Laugh While You Work, You've Had It, and This Is It for Kangaroo.|$|E

Manuel Billeter served as director of photography for the series, <b>after</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> same for Jessica Jones and Luke Cage, and Brett Chan was the stunt-coordinator and second unit director. Filming locations included Mariners Harbor and Sailors' Snug Harbor on Staten Island, which served as Bakuto's compound; 28 Liberty Street for the exterior of Rand Enterprises, while some interiors were filmed in the MetLife Building; 19 Gramercy Park South for Joy Meachum's home; City Hall Park; Chinatown, including Mott Street; {{the lobby of the}} General Electric Building for Harold Meachum's penthouse; the Manhattan Bridge; Green-Wood Cemetery; Bank of America Tower; Bryant Park; the Presidential Suite in the InterContinental New York Barclay Hotel, serving as Rand's temporary apartment; the STK Midtown restaurant; Brooklyn Navy Yard; Pelham Bay Park; the Bayonne Bridge, which doubled as Anzhou, China; and Sutton Place Park.

500|$|IQ {{scores have}} been derived by two {{different}} methods {{since the advent}} of cognitive ability tests. The first method historically was the [...] "ratio IQ", based on estimating a [...] "mental age" [...] of the test-taker (rounded to a specified number of years and months), which was then divided by the test-taker's [...] "chronological age" [...] (rounded to a specified number of years and months). For example, a mental age score of thirteen years and zero months for a test-taker with the chronological age ten years and zero months results in a quotient of 1.3 <b>after</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> division. The division result was then multiplied by 100 so that scores could be reported without decimal points. Thus the score in the example would be reported as IQ 130.|$|E

2500|$|Filming for {{the series}} takes place in New York City, {{significantly}} in Harlem, where the series is set. Coker described the neighborhood as [...] "the {{only place in the}} city where you see those wide boulevards. We really wanted to capture the color, the rhythm of the streets". For example, the production had the opportunity to film at a barbershop in Greenwich Village [...] "that would’ve been a little easier for us to shoot in", but Coker said [...] "the opportunity to film it in Harlem was irresistible. I didn’t want us to talk about Harlem and then not film in Harlem." [...] Sound stage work also takes place in New York. Manuel Billeter serves as director of photography {{for the series}}, <b>after</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> same for Jessica Jones.|$|E
2500|$|Manuel Billeter {{served as}} {{director}} of photography for the series, <b>after</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> same for Jessica Jones. He worked with director Paul McGuigan to establish {{the look of the}} show in the first two episodes, with Coker hiring McGuigan based on his direction of the Sherlock episode [...] "A Scandal in Belgravia". Coker was delighted to learn how little CGI McGuigan used to craft the visuals of that episode, and wanted the same approach for Luke Cage, [...] "just old school camera stuff. He brought a very analogue perspective, analogue feel to the show." [...] McGuigan, Coker explained, directed [...] "every scene [...] long takes, from multiple takes over and over again. We would run an entire eight page scene almost like a play, so when it comes together it’s seamless." [...] McGuigan was inspired by the works of photographers Gordon Parks, Tony Ray-Jones, and Jack Garofalo. Billeter looked to differentiate the look of Luke Cage from Jessica Jones, using modified gels on lights, and saturating and warming colors in color correction to give Harlem [...] "a more glowing look". Coker noted that the series' has a color scheme of yellow, brown, amber, and gold, in contrast to the [...] "violet tint" [...] Billeter gave Jessica Jones to reflect that series' villain, the Purple Man. The series was shot on Netflix's standard 4K cameras, with Billeter pairing them with Panavision Primo lenses that were [...] "custom treated with a reflective coating in between the glass elements in the interior of the lens, causing more flares and bringing down the contrast in addition to very slightly de-focusing them" [...] in order to [...] "add something magic, less controlled and more cinematic". Billeter filmed Colter with a lot of low angles to make him look [...] "even more heroic", and kept the camera close to him with Harlem in the background so that Cage [...] "is always the dominant force in his shots, but he also remains a part of the terrain. The shots aren’t of him alone; they’re of him in his home." ...|$|E
