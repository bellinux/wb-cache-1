40|$|The thesis aims {{to discuss}} if {{activation}} policies can support {{the inclusion of}} immigrant women and men into the Swedish labour market. A paradigmatic change in welfare policies {{has taken place in}} Europe during the last decade with the shift from welfare to workfare or activation policies. Some researchers claim that, for those excluded from the labour force, activation policies are the only way to inclusion in the labour market. Other researchers claim that only a universal welfare state can lead to such a result. This thesis on the other hand is based on the presumption that <b>activation</b> <b>policy</b> contains the possibility to mutually support an inclusion and to further marginalize from the labour market. The outcomes are related to the implementation and the local administration of <b>activation</b> <b>policy.</b> The thesis is based on a case study encompassing four districts in a middle-range Swedish city and includes approximately eighty interviews with administrators and immigrant men and women. The thesis shows that <b>activation</b> <b>policy</b> can lead to both a process towards inclusion in the labour market and to further marginalization of the immigrants. The process is dependant on differentiation patterns in the categorization of clients in the administration of <b>activation</b> <b>policy.</b> A discourse based on presumptions associated to race and gender in some districts tends to create a stereotypical differentiation which supports to further marginalize women, especially Muslim, from the labour market. While the pragmatic differentiation that takes place in one district promotes the inclusion of immigrant women into the labour market. This illustrates the Janus face of <b>activation</b> <b>policy</b> that is based on locally bound differentiation processes...|$|E

This paper explores why Irish labour <b>activation</b> <b>policy</b> and implementation stalled {{over the last three}} decades and the reasons for policy drift in this area. Framed by two crises, the paper maps the politics of Irish labour activation from the 1980 s crisis up to the contemporary crisis. It first analyses the politics of labour activation by tracing shifts in political discourses about labour activation over the last three decades. It then draws on bottom-up implementation theory to examine the micro politics of implementation, referring briefly to implementation of supportive labour activation strategies in the 1990 s and reviewing in more depth the National employment action plan in the 2000 s. It then maps institutions, political debates and advocacy coalitions to assist in understanding the politics of Irish labour <b>activation</b> <b>policy</b> and how its implementation was shaped and stalled. This analysis of the institutional, ideational, political interests and international factors that shaped or postponed Irish movement from passive to active welfare administration helps us better understand contemporary issues concerning the relationship between political discourse about labour activation and its implementation...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this {{introduction}} to the special issue is to give {{an overview of the}} key aspects of the governance of <b>activation</b> <b>policies</b> as discussed in the existing literature. It explains the focus and contribution of this special issue and provides a brief summary of the main findings in the individual articles. Design/methodology/approach – In this special issue the comparative analysis of the key aspects of governance of <b>activation</b> <b>policies</b> like centralization/decentralization, new public management, marketization and network governance is covered, accompanied by an assessment of the role of implementation conditions in shaping the real trends of governance reforms of <b>activation</b> <b>policies.</b> Further, the effects of governance reforms and the influence of EU governance on the dynamics of national <b>activation</b> <b>policies</b> are discussed. This comparative analysis leads to a typology of the “worlds of governance” of <b>activation</b> <b>policies</b> in Europe. Findings – All the countries show certain comparable converging trends in the reforms of governance of activation, although a closer look helps us determine the shape of increasingly different patterns of governance in several respects. In spite of this variety, another general finding is the common discrepancy between aims and effects: the key explanation involves implementation failures. Three governance regimes may be distinguished in the EU countries: committed marketizers, modernizers and slow modernizers.

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} {{a system of}} rechargeable sensor nodes deployed redundantly {{in the region of}} interest. Active sensor nodes are subject to a discharge process which depends on the occurrence of events in the system. All sensor nodes experience a continuous recharge of their battery energies, however at a considerably lower rate than of discharge. The decision problem is to find the optimal <b>activation</b> <b>policy</b> for the sensor nodes which would maximize the aggregate system utility. We model our rechargeable sensor system as a system of finite-buffer queues and show the existence of a simple threshold <b>activation</b> <b>policy</b> that achieves near optimal performance.

40|$|In the 1990 s, many {{municipalities}} developed local activation {{programs for}} social assistance recipients {{as a response}} to increasing social assistance expenditures.

The study utilizes a street-level bureaucracy perspective, which illuminates the role of bureaucratic and professional discretion and how institutional factors shape the practical responses of front-line staff.

30|$|This study {{refer to}} ‘activation policies’ {{in a rather}} wide sense; it {{basically}} means that the unemployed must participate in activation programmes {{in order to be}} eligible for unemployment benefits or social assistance. The developing trajectory of this policy area can be studied from many different angles including the content, volume, activation instruments etc. Because this study is mainly interested in to what extent the institutional pathways of the Scandinavian welfare states prevails when confronted with newcomers three dimensions are singled out (see below), see Hernes and Tronstad (2014) for an in-depth comparative analysis of other dimensions. When analysing the institutional pathways {{it is important to be}} aware that some labour market researchers have argued that the specific institutional and normative features of the Nordic countries are also reflected in their <b>activation</b> <b>policies</b> (Barbier, 2004; Jørgensen, 2008) while others have been more critical about these conclusions (e.g. Johansson & Hvinden, 2007, p. 53; Lødemel & Moreira, 2014; Jørgensen, 2008). However, these studies are concerned with <b>activation</b> <b>policies</b> targeting citizens in general and not how the active, duty-based approach interconnects with integration policies targeting newcomers (Breidahl, 2012). The three dimensions below are therefore all based on the premise that the manner in which the <b>activation</b> <b>policies</b> generally have taken place is not necessarily reflected in how policies for newcomers are manifested.|$|R
40|$|<b>Activation</b> <b>policies</b> were {{designed}} in the 70 s to facilitate {{a return to the}} labour market for those who had been sidelined by the economic transformations. In the 90 s activation programs are being proposed by governments and international institutions as the EU as an efficient strategy to combat social exclusion. However, {{there have been a number}} of questions raised as to the real purpose and effect of those programs. Are they efficient tackling social exclusion? Or are they designed to prevent dependency and contribute to cut social budget? International comparative analysis of <b>activation</b> <b>policies</b> shows not only that <b>activation</b> <b>policies</b> have little effect in the employability of the people most excluded from the labour force but also that the last reforms leading to strengthen emphasis on individual responsibilities are having negative effects on those unable to accomplish activation commitments. Only in those countries where there is a minimum income guaranteed that acts as a safety net those risks are being minimized. By contrast, the most negative effects for the weakest are taking place in those countries with limited income protection and where there is a wider extension of precarious employment. Empirical evidence from a case study in Navarre (Spain) contributes to highlight some of the key factors for this lack of effectiveness of activation with the most excluded groups...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{draws on}} the {{findings}} of three qualitative case studies on the organisation of integrated <b>activation</b> <b>policies</b> and aims at identifying the impact of ‘changing landscapes of policy delivery’ with a focus on marketization. The majority of the European countries have experienced a turn towards <b>activation</b> <b>policies</b> during the last two decades (Serrano Pascual et al. 2007, van Berkel/Borghi 2008, Bonoli 2010, Aurich 2011; Graziano 2009 and 2012). The interlinked aim to increase employment rates by integrating formerly excluded groups into the labour market requires a closer link of training, family or social policies with employment policy, and often comes along with modifications regarding the organisation of policy delivery (van Berkel et al. 2012 : 263). One of these policy changes concerns the marketization of employment and social services (Considine 2001, Newman 2001), although to very different extents in different countries. Furthermore, since the local level plays a crucial role in delivering integrated policies (Künzel 2012, Green/Orton 2012), this level deserves particular scrutiny which is not much present in the welfare state change literature. Therefore, we investigate the way in which local social and employment services have become marketized in different countries, the determinants of this marketization, {{and its impact on the}} delivery of <b>activation</b> <b>policies.</b> The research question will be answered with reference to three most different cases regarding worlds of welfare (Germany, Italy and the UK) ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} has documented a trend towards the individualization of activation policies.

The paper asks: what does the brief and tumultuous tenure of this initiative reveal {{about the role of}} the individual in contemporary welfare administration and <b>activation</b> <b>policy?</b> Based on a theoretical engagement with the works of Ulrich Beck, Elizabeth Beck-Gernsheim and Anthony Giddens, and an ethnographic study of frontline interactions in Centrelink, Australia's national benefits agency, the paper argues we should understand the rise and fall of One to One Service in terms of contradictions between two competing forms of contemporary welfare individualization, referred to as 'democratic relationships' and 'compulsory choice'. One to One Service represented a push for individualized, democratic relationships between staff and clients; yet it was undermined because policy makers chose to emphasize an alternative form of individualization premised on forcing recipients to take responsibility for their lives and move off welfare.

30|$|Breidahl {{contributes}} with {{a comparative}} study of labour market <b>activation</b> <b>policies</b> in Denmark, Sweden and Norway. In this integration policy area, rather than divergence, important similarities come into view. All Scandinavian countries have introductory programs for new-arrivals with strong emphasis on conditionality, although Sweden does not tie participation in the programs to permanent residence or citizenship. Breidahl argues that similar, strong and rooted norms of state involvement and employment capacity, closely connected to the functionality of the universal welfare state, exist in all three countries. However, she concludes that the “strong interconnection between <b>activation</b> <b>policies</b> and the civic turn seems to be exceptional to the Scandinavian welfare states {{and should not be}} interpreted as a retreat from national models”. Instead, it is a shared feature of their respective national models, originating in the fiscal requirement of the universal welfare state for high unemployment.|$|R

The optimal sensor activation problem is a very difficult decision question, and under Markovian assumptions on the sensor discharge/recharge periods, it represents a complex semi-Markov decision problem.

For this scenario, we show analytically that there exists a simple threshold <b>activation</b> <b>policy</b> that achieves a performance of at least 3 of the optimum over all possible policies. We extend this 4 threshold policy to a general network setting where the coverage areas of different sensors could have partial or no overlap with each other, and show by simulations that the performance of our policy is very close to that of the globally optimal policy.
