25|$|A Windsor {{chair is}} a chair built {{with a solid}} wooden seat into which the chair-back and legs are round-tenoned, or pushed into drilled holes, in {{contrast}} to standard chairs, where the back legs and the uprights of the back are continuous. The seats of Windsor chairs were often carved into <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>dish</b> or saddle shape for comfort. Traditionally, the legs and uprights were usually turned on a pole lathe. The back and sometimes the arm pieces (if arms are present) are formed from steam bent pieces of wood.|$|E
2500|$|Gratin (...) is a {{widespread}} culinary technique in which an ingredient is topped with a browned crust, often using breadcrumbs, grated cheese, egg and/or butter. Gratin originated in French cuisine and is usually prepared in <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>dish</b> of some kind. A gratin is baked or cooked under an overhead grill or broiler to form a golden crust on top and is traditionally served in its baking dish.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the last}} two decades of the 1st century, the Dragendorff 37, a deep, rounded vessel with a plain upright rim, overtook the 29 in popularity. [...] This simple shape {{remained}} the standard Gaulish samian relief-decorated form, from all Gaulish manufacturing regions, for more than a century. [...] Small relief-decorated beakers such as forms Déchelette 67 and Knorr 78 were also made in South Gaul, as were occasional 'one-off' or very ambitious mould-made vessels, such as large thin-walled flagons and flasks. [...] But the mass of South Gaulish samian found on Roman sites of the 1st century AD consists of plain dishes, bowls and cups, especially Dr.18 (<b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>dish)</b> and Dr.27 (a little cup with a distinctive double curve to the profile), many of which bear potters' name-stamps, and the large decorated forms 29, 30 and 37.|$|E

60|$|A fat brown goose lay {{at one end}} of {{the table}} and at the other end, on a bed of creased paper strewn with sprigs of parsley, lay a great ham, {{stripped}} of its outer skin and peppered over with crust crumbs, a neat paper frill round its shin and beside this was a round of spiced beef. Between these rival ends ran parallel lines of side-dishes: two little minsters of jelly, red and yellow; <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>dish</b> full of blocks of blancmange and red jam, a large green leaf-shaped dish with a stalk-shaped handle, on which lay bunches of purple raisins and peeled almonds, a companion dish on which lay a solid rectangle of Smyrna figs, a dish of custard topped with grated nutmeg, a small bowl full of chocolates and sweets wrapped in gold and silver papers and a glass vase in which stood some tall celery stalks. In the centre of the table there stood, as sentries to a fruit-stand which upheld a pyramid of oranges and American apples, two squat old-fashioned decanters of cut glass, one containing port and the other dark sherry. On the closed square piano a pudding in a huge yellow dish lay in waiting and behind it were three squads of bottles of stout and ale and minerals, drawn up according to the colours of their uniforms, the first two black, with brown and red labels, the third and smallest squad white, with transverse green sashes.|$|E

50|$|Clean water {{should be}} always available; the amount {{actually}} drunk {{varies with the}} food consumed. Willow twigs need {{to be provided for}} abrading the continuously growing teeth. Lemmings can drink from <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>dish,</b> but since they typically track their bedding into the water, a bottle with a ball valve is better.|$|E
5000|$|Food is not {{actually}} served on chargers; {{they are often}} called underplates or chop plates. The word [...] "charger" [...] originated around 1275-1325 from the Middle English [...] "chargeour".

50|$|In the 19th {{century the}} pounce pots or sanders often had <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>dish</b> round the top so that pounce or sand could be {{returned}} to the pot and reused. The process is very effective for quickly drying ink, and although blotting paper has been available since Tudor times, pounce or sand continued to be used throughout the nineteenth century because it was often cheaper.|$|E

50|$|Incan {{ceramics}} {{are usually}} very distinct {{and easy to}} recognize. The shapes of the vessels are highly standardized. The most typical Incan pottery would have a spherical body with a cone shaped base. This spherical body usually includes two vertical side handles with a tall neck and flaring rim. The Incans often would place animal heads on their pottery as well usually {{near the top of}} the vessel. There were also several other popular styles for Incan ceramics which included <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>dish</b> with a single bird head and handle, a pedestal beaker, and a single or double handled bottle.|$|E
5000|$|The candle, whose rate {{of burning}} was known, bore against the {{underside}} of the cap, and its wick passed through the hole. Wax collected in the indentation and could be removed periodically so that it did not interfere with steady burning. The bottom of the candle rested in <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>dish</b> that had a ring on its side connected through pulleys to a counterweight. As the candle burned away, the weight pushed it upward at a constant speed. The automata were operated from the dish {{at the bottom of the}} candle. No other candle clocks of this sophistication are known.|$|E
5000|$|Placing the cat's {{water in}} <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>dish</b> may prevent the chin from {{absorbing}} the {{bacteria in the}} water while the cat is drinking. If the cat is allergic to plastics or dyes, using a stainless-steel or glass dish is recommended [...] Cats may also have food allergies that make the development of acne more likely, so that switching kibble, and especially removing surplus grain from the cat's diet may be effective. Maintaining good hygiene and grooming habits make the development of feline acne less likely. Washing and exfoliating the chin with a gentle benzoyl-peroxide solution also may be preventive of further outbreaks.|$|E
50|$|The gratin dauphinois is {{made with}} raw {{potatoes}}, thinly sliced, and cream, cooked in a buttered dish rubbed with garlic; for 1 kg of potatoes, about 600 ml of cream, 25 g of butter and a clove of garlic are needed. The potatoes are peeled and sliced to the thickness of a coin, preferably with a mandoline; they are layered in <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> earthenware <b>dish</b> and cooked in a slow oven, at about 150 °C (300 °F), {{for more than an}} hour; the heat is raised for the last 10 minutes of the cooking time.|$|R
50|$|The dish is {{prepared}} with cashew nuts soaked {{in water for}} a considerable period of time (usually overnight), which are then ground to a paste. Sugar solution is boiled down to a single thread syrup and {{is added to the}} ground cashews. Ghee, saffron (kesar), and dried fruits may also be added. The paste is then spread and flattened in <b>a</b> <b>shallow,</b> flat-bottomed <b>dish</b> and cut into bite-sized diamond-shaped pieces. The pieces are usually decorated with edible silver foil. The finished sweet is usually white or yellow in color depending on the ingredients used for the paste and the proportions of each used. Katli is traditionally eaten during Diwali.|$|R
5000|$|A-hlu lahpet (...) or Mandalay lahpet {{is served}} {{traditionally}} in <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> lacquerware <b>dish</b> called lahpet ohk with a lid and divided into small compartments. Pickled tea is laced with sesame {{oil in a}} central compartment surrounded, in their own compartments, by other ingredients namely crisp fried garlic, peas and peanuts, toasted sesame, crushed dried shrimp, preserved shredded ginger and fried shredded coconut. A rare treat in Mandalay may be a delicacy, dried and lightly pan-fried, called twin poh [...] - [...] a species of aquatic grub that is found only in a lake in the crater of an extinct volcano called Twindaung near Monywa.|$|R
50|$|The most {{distinctive}} vessel {{is probably a}} rice bowl on a stem with a spired lid for monks called hsun ok. Lahpet ok is <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>dish</b> with a lid and {{has a number of}} compartments for serving lahpet (pickled tea) with its various accompaniments. Stackable tiffin carriers fastened with a single handle or hsun gyaink are usually plain red or black. Daunglan are low tables for meals and may be simple broad based or have three curved feet in animal or floral designs with a lid. Water carafes or yeidagaung with a cup doubling as a lid, and vases are also among lacquerware still in use in many monasteries.|$|E
50|$|The Stour rises on the {{north-eastern}} {{edge of the}} Clent Hills, an outcrop of New red sandstone that traps it on the West Midland plateau. Its {{course is}} mainly over similar sandstone, together with some gravels, as it finds its way off the plateau by a fairly circuitous route, to the Severn valley. In this it {{is similar to the}} Tame and its own tributary, the Smestow: all are forced to wander far along generally shallow gradients as they find their way from the plateau, which is essentially <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>dish</b> in shape - a low tableland with raised edges. It carries mainly sandy sediments, as can be seen after rainfall.|$|E
50|$|An EFP, on {{the other}} hand, has a liner face {{in the shape of}} <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>dish.</b> The force of the blast moulds the liner into any of a number of shapes, {{depending}} on the shape of the plate and how the explosive is detonated. Some sophisticated EFP warheads have multiple detonators that can be fired in different arrangements causing different types of waveform in the explosive, resulting in either a long-rod penetrator, an aerodynamic slug projectile, or multiple high-velocity fragments. A less sophisticated approach for changing the formation of an EFP is the use of wire-mesh in front of the liner: with the mesh in place the liner fragments into multiple penetrators.|$|E
5000|$|Lake Cargelligo ( [...] , locally [...] ) {{is a town}} in the Central West {{region of}} New South Wales, Australia, on Lake Cargelligo. It is in Lachlan Shire. At the 2011 census, Lake Cargelligo had a {{population}} of 1,380 people. Its name {{is said to be}} a corruption of the Aboriginal word 'Kartjellakoo' meaning 'he had a coolamon'.

50|$|The frogs {{are popular}} pets {{because of their}} small size, appearance, and the undemanding {{conditions}} needed {{to take care of}} them. Unlike many amphibians, they do not require artificial heating. They need a large (at least ten-gallon) terrarium and do best with a substrate that will hold some humidity, such as commercial shredded bark or coconut husk bedding, or untreated topsoil on the floor of their terrarium. Tree frogs are arboreal, so the height on the tank {{is more important than the}} length. A variety of things for climbing, such as plants or branches, should be in the habitat. <b>A</b> <b>shallow</b> water <b>dish</b> should be included. Captive frogs should not be handled any more than necessary; when necessary, clean gloves should be worn.|$|R
