40|$|The NASA Johnson Space Center built a 4200 sq ft parafoil for the U. S. Army Natick Soldier Center to {{demonstrate}} autonomous flight using a guided parafoil system to deliver 10, 000 lbs of useable payload. The parafoil's design {{was based upon}} that developed during the X- 38 program. The drop test payload consisted of a standard 20 -foot Type V <b>airdrop</b> <b>platform,</b> a standard 12 -foot weight tub, a 60 ft drogue parachute, a 4200 ft 2 parafoil, an instrumentation system, and a Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GN&C) system. Instrumentation installed on the load was used to gather data to validate simulation models and preflight loads predictions and to perform post flight trajectory and performance reconstructions. The GN&C system, developed during NASA's X- 38 program, consisted of a flight computer, modems for uplink commands and downlink data, a compass, laser altimeter, and two winches. The winches were used to steer the parafoil and to perform the dynamic flare maneuver for a soft landing. The laser was used to initiate the flare. The GN&C software was originally provided to NASA by the European Space Agency. NASA incorporated further software refinements based upon the X- 38 flight test results. Three full-scale drop tests were conducted, with the third being performed during the Precision Airdrop Technology Conference and Demonstration (PATCAD) Conference at the U. S. Army Yuma Proving Ground (YPG) in November of 2003. For the PATCAD demonstration, the parafoil and GN&C software and hardware performed well, concluding with a good flare and the smallest miss distance ever experienced in NASA's parafoil drop test program. This paper describes the 4200 sq ft parafoil system, simulation results, {{and the results of}} the drop tests...|$|E
50|$|GBU-43s are {{delivered}} from C-130 cargo planes, inside {{which they are}} carried on cradles resting on <b>airdrop</b> <b>platforms.</b> The bombs are dropped by deploying drogue parachutes, which also extract the cradle and platform from the aircraft. Shortly after launch, the drogues are released and bombs fall unretarded. GPS satellite-guidance is used to guide bombs to their targets.|$|R
40|$|Various cargo drop {{configurations}} {{have been}} analyzed using stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry (SPIV). The PIV measurement planes were located at several {{positions in the}} wake of a generic transport aircraft model with an open ramp. The stream- and spanwise positioning of the wind tunnel model was facilitated by means of positioning mechanism of the wind tunnel facility. The first measured configuration consisted of only the wake of the transport aircraft. The cargo configurations consisted of a model of a cargo container, including a rigid parachute and a cargo with an <b>airdrop</b> support <b>platform.</b> A fixed haltering mechanism was used to keep the cargo at a fixed position behind the wind tunnel model for the PIV measurements. The resulting velocity fields (obtained at several chord wise positions) are used to discuss the flow topologies for these airdrop configurations...|$|R
