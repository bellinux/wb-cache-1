However, the nitrogen-substituted analogs, which otherwise possess all of the remaining significant structural entities of typical substrates, function as inhibitors of <b>alpha-chymotrypsin</b> catalyzed hydrolyses but in general show less affinity for the enzyme than do the analogous C-H containing substrates. It has been found that l-acetyl- 2 -[L-tyrosyl] hydrazine is a reversible inhibitor of <b>alpha-chymotrypsin</b> catalyzed hydrolyses with unusual affinity for the enzyme.

This aggregation, which was monitored spectrophotometrically, was {{dependent upon the}} protease activities and was resistant to treatment with either a calcium chelating reagent (EDTA) or neuraminidase. However, the tumour cell aggregates were redispersed by treatment with deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I). This dispersal effect was dependent upon the DNase activity. A possible relationship between the tumour cell aggregation and development of blood-borne metastasis was studied. An intravenous inoculation in rats of tumour cell aggregates performed by the <b>alpha-chymotrypsin</b> treatment resulted in significantly higher numbers of lung metastatic foci than an injection of single cells. When the re-separated single cells, prepared in vitro by treatment with DNase I following <b>alpha-chymotrypsin</b> treatment, were injected instead of the aggregates, the enhancement of metastasis was reversed. These enhancement and reversal effects were mimicked in vivo by intravenous injections of protease and nuclease following inoculation of a single cell suspension. That is, the number of metastatic foci caused by single cell inoculation followed by an intravenous <b>alpha-chymotrypsin</b> injection, was higher than that in a control group receiving PBS instead of <b>alpha-chymotrypsin.</b> Again, this augmentation was reversed by an injection of DNase I following <b>alpha-chymotrypsin</b> injection.

Besides, the synthesis reactions of the dipeptide derivative using the free and immobilized <b>alpha-chymotrypsin</b> were compared. The yields of the dipepticle derivative via the free or immobilized <b>alpha-chymotrypsin</b> catalyzed were almost the same. The alpha-chymotrypsin-Fe 3 O 4 -CS nanoparticles exhibited a good acid-resisting ability and the less reaction time was required for dipeptide synthesis.

Cytotoxicity was prevented by the presence of soybean trypsin inhibitor, indicating the effects were due to protease activity. In contrast, there was no significant cytotoxicity after exposure of GS/M to either enzyme at the same enzyme concentration. After exposure to <b>alpha-chymotrypsin,</b> susceptible G. lamblia became rounded and then lysed, but after exposure to trypsin, G. lamblia appeared plastered onto the surface of the well and was intertwined and surrounded by finely granular material. Effects were concentration and time dependent; at least 6 h of treatment was required to observe changes 12 to 18 h later. Trophozoites surviving <b>alpha-chymotrypsin</b> or trypsin exposure became stably resistant to protease treatment. In vitro, the variant surface antigen of GS/M, but not those of WB or B 6, resisted digestion by trypsin or <b>alpha-chymotrypsin,</b> suggesting that the variant surface antigens impart susceptibility or resistance to digestion.

Proteolysis does not occur {{in the presence of}} Ca 2 + (10 mM). Cleavage with <b>alpha-chymotrypsin</b> prevents the Ca(2 +) -dependent binding of SAP to zymosan extract, nucleosomes, and DNA. The <b>alpha-chymotrypsin</b> cleavage site identified is in a region of SAP that is highly conserved in members of the human C-reactive protein (CRP) family of proteins (pentraxins) to which SAP belongs and is similar to the Ca(2 +) -binding site in calmodulin and related Ca(2 +) -binding proteins (Nguyen, N.

One part of the active sites generates a nucleophilic suction-pump. Its isocontour at - 10 kcal mol- 1 defines an impressive, negatively-charged volume which bears a narrow channel in the immediate vicinity of the active-site serine 195 in <b>alpha-chymotrypsin</b> or 221 in subtilisin. In native <b>alpha-chymotrypsin,</b> there is a perfect complementation between this nucleophilic suction-pump and the positively-charged electrophilic hole that is generated by the backbone NH of Ser 195 and Gly 193.

40|$|High {{sensitivity}} {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (d. s. c.) and uv-visible spectrophotometry {{have been}} used to study the thermal unfolding of <b>alpha-chymotrypsin</b> in presence of calcium chloride at pH = 2. 8, 3. 4, 5. 0, 7. 0, and 8. 2. Quantitative thermodynamic parameters accompanying the thermal transitions have been evaluated. In the absence of calcium ions, the thermal denaturation of a-chymotrypsin is a reversible process giving a ratio of the van't Hoff to calorimetric enthalpy of 0. 92 at pH = 2. 8. At pH values higher than 5. 0, the thermal denaturations in the absence of calcium chloride were observed to be completely irreversible. In the presence of calcium chloride, <b>alpha-chymotrypsin</b> undergoes irreversible thermal denaturation and its thermal transitions are found to be scan-rate dependent fitting to the model N- 2 [...] > I, yielding an average activation energy of (419 +/- 16) kJ (.) mol(- 1) using different approaches at pH = 2. 8. It is also observed that at pH 2. 8 and 3. 4, calcium reduces the transition temperature of the protein. However, at pH 5. 0, 7. 0, and 8. 2, it stabilizes initially, and at higher concentrations the salt acts as a destabilizer of the native structure of <b>alpha-chymotrypsin.</b> The surface tension values of aqueous calcium chloride solutions were measured and it is observed that the role of surface tension of the medium is not dominant in providing thermal stability of this protein.

40|$|The use of {{a linear}} free-energy {{relationship}} shows that both histidine residues of <b>alpha-chymotrypsin</b> and chymotrypsinogen are super-reactive toward 1 -fluoro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene. The binding of indole to the specificity site of <b>alpha-chymotrypsin</b> causes both histidine residues to become less reactive. On {{the basis of these}} results and those from X-ray-crystallographic studies, the following conclusions are made. (1) The super-reactivity of the catalytic-site histidine- 57 is due to charge transfer from aspartic acid- 102 by means of hydrogen bonding. (2) The aspartic acid- 102 -histidine- 57 -serine- 195 'charge-relay' system is not complete in the zymogen or native enzyme and only on binding of a suitable substrate or ligand to the specificity site of the enzyme is the charge transfer to serine- 195 completed. (3) The lack of substantial enzymic activity in the zymogen is due to the absence of a completed specificity site, and therefore it cannot bind suitable substrates or ligands to induce completion of the charge-relay system...|$|E

The effect {{of variation in}} the concentration of tris-(hydroxymethyl) -aminomethane buffer systems upon the kinetic constants of the <b>alpha-chymotrypsin</b> catalyzed hydrolysis of nicotinyl-L-tyrosinhydrazide has been determined at pH 7. 9 and 25. 0 [degrees]C. This study indicates a linear relationship between the logarithm of values of [ [...] . ] and the square root of the ionic strength. It has been demonstrated, {{in the case of}} the hydrazide investigated, that the value of the Michaelis-Menten constant, [ [...] . ], is independent of the variations applied. A confirmation of the activating influence of calcium ion has been made. An increase of approximately 75 % in the initial velocity of the <b>alpha-chymotrypsin</b> catalyzed hydrolysis of nicotinyl-L-tyrosinhydrazide is noted upon the addition of [ [...] . ] calcium ion to the reaction system. The colorimetric determination of hydrazine employed to determine the extent of hydrolysis in the above cases has been reinvestigated. A reinvestigation of the kinetics of the <b>alpha-chymotrypsin</b> catalyzed hydrolysis of acetyl-L-tyrosinhydrazide utilizing improved procedures of analysis indicated above has been made. The possibility of observing product inhibition depending upon values of initial substrate concentration and [ [...] . ] is discussed. The preparation of acetyl-, benzoyl-, trifluoracetyl-, and methanesulfonyl-DL-phenylalanine salicylamide esters is described. Several attempts to synthesize the optically active esters are described. Reasons for racemization in the cases tried are briefly discussed. During the course of attempted dehydration procedures with polyphosphoric acid several interesting dehydrocyclination products are isolated and described. The preparation of trifluoracetyl-L-phenylalanine anthranilamide is described. The synthesis of acetyl-DL-phenylalanine glycolamide and acetyl-L-phenylalanine glycolamide are described. Preliminary investigations were conducted in the <b>alpha-chymotrypsin</b> catalyzed hydrolysis of the above compound. The apparent ionization constants of the protonated amino group of a series of DL-phenylalanine derivatives have been determined. The expected differences in the pK of these derivatives due to changes in acid derivative were not realized except in the case of phenylalanine hydrazide. The use of an automatic pH titration and recording instrument is described...|$|E
40|$|Single cardiac Na+ {{channels}} {{were investigated}} after intracellular proteolysis {{to remove the}} fast inactivation process {{in an attempt to}} elucidate the mechanisms of channel gating and the role of slow inactivation. Na+ channels were studied in inside-out patches excised from guinea-pig ventricular myocytes both before and after very brief exposure (2 - 4 min) to the endopeptidase, <b>alpha-chymotrypsin.</b> Enzyme exposure times were chosen to maximize removal of fast inactivation and to minimize potential nonspecific damage to the channel. After proteolysis, the single channel current-voltage relationship was approximately linear with a slope conductance of 18 +/- 2. 5 pS. Na+ channel reversal potentials measured before and after proteolysis by <b>alpha-chymotrypsin</b> were not changed. The unitary current amplitude was not altered after channel modification suggesting little or no effect on channel conductance. Channel open times were increased after removal of fast inactivation and were voltage-dependent, ranging between 0. 7 (- 70 mV) and 3. 2 (- 10 mV) ms. Open times increased with membrane potential reaching a maximum at - 10 mV; at more positive membrane potentials, open times decreased again. Fast inactivation appeared to be completely removed by <b>alpha-chymotrypsin</b> and slow inactivation became more apparent suggesting that fast and slow inactivation normally compete, and that fast inactivation dominates in unmodified channels. This finding is not consistent with a slow inactivated state that can only be entered through the fast inactivated state, since removal of fast inactivation does not eliminate slow inactivation. The data indicate that cardiac Na+ channels can enter the slow inactivated state by a pathway that bypasses the fast inactivated state and that the likelihood of entering the slow inactivated state increases after removal of fast inactivation...|$|E

40|$|Proteases and glycosidases are {{classes of}} hydrolytic enzymes {{that are used}} in biotransformations to {{catalyse}} the synthesis of peptides, and of glycosides and oligosaccharaides, respectively, by a reversal of their normal mode of action. The practical application of both methods shares several common features, namely the shift of rate-determining step through the use of activated substrates (aminoacyl and glycosyl donors respectively), the need to reduce or eliminate competing hydrolysis in the aminoacyl and glycosyl transfer steps, and the need to minimise hydrolytic cleavage of the products. Control of these factors is illustrated by a method for peptide synthesis using <b>alpha-chymotrypsin</b> suspended in dichloromethane containing low concentrations of water and a method for disaccharide synthesis using an N-acetylgalactosaminidase from Aspergillus oryzae. Molecular modelling of the oxyanion intermediate has been found to explain a number of features of reactions catalysed by <b>alpha-chymotrypsin</b> and to predict others that were the subject of experimental test. The concept of "anomeric control" was used to modulate the regioselectivity of N-acetylgalactosaminyl transfer catalysed by the N-acetylgalactosaminidase...|$|E
40|$|Given the {{importance}} of protein complexes as therapeutic targets, {{it is necessary to}} understand the physical chemistry of these interactions under the crowded conditions that exist in cells. We have used sedimentation equilibrium to quantify the enhancement of the reversible homodimerization of <b>alpha-chymotrypsin</b> by high concentrations of the osmolytes glucose, sucrose, and raffinose. In an attempt to rationalize the ostuolyte-mediated stabilization of the a-chymotrypsin homodimer, we have used models based on binding interactions (transfer-free energy analysis) and steric interactions (excluded volume theory) to predict the stabilization. Although transfer-free energy analysis predicts reasonably well the relatively small stabilization observed for complex formation between cytochrome c and cytochrome c peroxidase, as well as that between bobtail quail lysozyme and a monoclonal Fab fragment, it underestimates the sugar-mediated stabilization of the <b>alpha-chymotrypsin</b> dimer. Although predictions based on excluded volume theory overestimate the stabilization, it would seem that a major determinant in the observed stabilization of the a-chymotrypsin homodimer is the thermodynamic nonideality arising from molecular crowding by the three small sugars...|$|E
