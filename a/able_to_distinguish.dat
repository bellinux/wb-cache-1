5|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 18th century, Charles Messier {{compiled}} a catalog containing the 109 brightest celestial objects having nebulous appearance. Subsequently, William Herschel assembled a catalog of 5,000 nebulae. In 1845, Lord Rosse constructed a new telescope and was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> between elliptical and spiral nebulae. He also managed to make out individual point sources in some of these nebulae, lending credence to Kant's earlier conjecture.|$|E
5|$|Although Sumerian and Babylonian artists mainly {{depicted}} ceremonial instruments, {{historians have}} been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> six idiophones used in early Mesopotamia: concussion clubs, clappers, sistra, bells, cymbals, and rattles. Sistra are depicted prominently {{in a great}} relief of Amenhotep III, and are of particular interest because similar designs {{have been found in}} far-reaching places such as Tbilisi, Georgia and among the Native American Yaqui tribe. The people of Mesopotamia preferred stringed instruments to any other, as evidenced by their proliferation in Mesopotamian figurines, plaques, and seals. Innumerable varieties of harps are depicted, as well as lyres and lutes, the forerunner of modern stringed instruments such as the violin.|$|E

50|$|An {{important}} question related to Curvature invariants {{is when the}} set of polynomial curvature invariants can be used <b>to</b> (locally) <b>distinguish</b> manifolds. <b>To</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> do this is necessary to include higher-order invariants including derivatives of the Riemann tensor but in the Lorentzian case, {{it is known that}} there are spacetimes which cannot be distinguished; e.g., the VSI spacetimes for which all such curvature invariants vanish and thus cannot be distinguished from flat space. This failure of being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>distinguishing</b> Lorentzian manifolds is related {{to the fact that the}} Lorentz group is non-compact.|$|R

5|$|Early {{spectral}} {{classification of}} the nuclei of the LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers {{indicated that the}} properties of LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers cannot be distinguished from the overall population of LIRGs. Roughly one third of megamaser hosts are classified as starburst galaxies, one quarter are classified as Seyfert 2 galaxies, and the remainder are classified as low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions, or LINERs. The optical properties of hydroxyl megamaser hosts and non-hosts are not significantly different. Recent infrared observations using the Spitzer Space Telescope are, however, <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> hydroxyl megamaser hosts galaxies from non-masing LIRGs, as 10–25% of hydroxyl megamaser hosts show evidence for an active galactic nucleus, compared to 50–95% for non-masing LIRGs.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Hearts II Final Mixs secret ending {{features}} a character named Ventus who bears a strong {{striking resemblance to}} him. Nomura commented that, despite their similarities, Roxas and Ventus {{are not the same}} character. He also said that when playing Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, players will be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> Roxas from Ventus. In another interview, Nomura implied both characters are related, specifically to Sora, but he wanted fans to imagine reasons for such a connection. For the upcoming game Kingdom Hearts III, there is a possibility of Roxas being revived despite Sora being alive at the same time. Nomura says this will be {{explained by the fact that}} the character Xehanort whose Heartless and Nobody, Ansem and Xemnas, exist at the same time as the original one.|$|E
5|$|Like other crustaceans, malacostracans {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} in which the heart pumps blood into the hemocoel (body cavity) where it {{supplies}} the needs of the organs for oxygen and nutrients before diffusing back to the heart. The typical respiratory pigment in malacostracans is haemocyanin. Structures that function as kidneys are located near the base of the antennae. A brain exists in the form of ganglia close to the antennae, there are ganglia in each segment and a collection of major ganglia below the oesophagus. Sensory organs include compound eyes (often stalked), ocelli (simple eyes), statocysts and sensory bristles. The naupliar eye is a characteristic of the nauplius larva and consists of four cup-shaped ocelli facing in different directions and <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> between light and darkness.|$|E

5|$|Until the mid-18th century, {{the design}} and {{significance}} of maritime flags flying on ships in Tunis are unknown. However, various sources have been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> certain similarities among the flags: they were designed with a crescent-oriented shape {{in the presence of}} the colors blue, green, red, and white. Thereafter, and until the early 19th century, the flag was composed of horizontal blue, red and green stripes, identifying the Ottoman regency in Tunis. This kind of flag with multiple bands and irregular contours floated on top of ships all along the coast of North Africa; similar flags with different colors and arrangements were also used on the continent.|$|E
5|$|CCC Camp S-95, {{which opened}} on May 29, 1933 {{on the site}} of an old lumber camp, was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> itself over the years it {{operated}} in Sullivan County. Two floods swept through the area in 1933 and 1936. The August flood of 1933 caused extensive damage and largely destroyed the newly built camp. During the course of the flooding two young men from Camp S-95 saved the lives of two drowning children at Worlds End State Park. The flood of 1936 covered a large area within the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley. The young men of the CCC camp were among the leaders in the cleaning up after the flood and rebuilding many destroyed bridges and roads. In 1936 the park was officially expanded beyond the original small picnic area. Camp S-95 closed in 1941.|$|E
5|$|Drumming {{is a form}} of non-vocal {{communication}} used by {{most species}} of woodpecker and involves the bill being repeatedly struck on a hard surface with great rapidity. After a pause, the drum roll is repeated, each species having a pattern which is unique in the number of beats in the roll, the length of the roll, the length of the gap between rolls and the cadence. The drumming is mainly a territorial call, equivalent to the song of a passerine, with male birds drumming more frequently than females. Woodpeckers choose a surface that resonates, such as a hollow tree, and may use man-made structures such as gutters and downpipes. Drumming serves for the mutual recognition of conspecifics and plays a part in courtship rituals. Individual birds are thought to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> the drumming of their mates and that of their neighbours.|$|E

5|$|Malaria {{is usually}} {{confirmed}} by the microscopic examination of blood films or by antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). In some areas, RDTs need to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> whether the malaria symptoms are caused by Plasmodium falciparum or by other species of parasites since treatment strategies could differ for non-P. falciparum infections. Microscopy is {{the most commonly used}} method to detect the malarial parasite—about 165 million blood films were examined for malaria in 2010. Despite its widespread usage, diagnosis by microscopy suffers from two main drawbacks: many settings (especially rural) are not equipped to perform the test, and the accuracy of the results depends on both the skill of the person examining the blood film and the levels of the parasite in the blood. The sensitivity of blood films ranges from 75–90% in optimum conditions, to as low as 50%. Commercially available RDTs are often more accurate than blood films at predicting the presence of malaria parasites, but they are widely variable in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity depending on manufacturer, and are unable to tell how many parasites are present.|$|E
5|$|Nomura commented that, despite how similar they are, Roxas and Ventus are not {{the same}} character. Additionally, he stated that by playing Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, players will be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> Roxas from Ventus and that the game explores his true personality. In another interview, Nomura implied both {{characters}} are related, specifically to Sora, but he wanted fans to imagine reasons for such connection. The guidebook Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Ultimania clarified the connection, stating that Roxas and Ventus look alike because Ventus' heart entered Sora's body and Roxas' birth allowed Ventus to influence his appearance. In early versions of development, Nomura planned to have Ventus' broken heart be healed by the heart of Sora before he was born, but after negative feedback from overseas coworkers it was abandoned. Like Roxas, Ventus has been voiced Kōki Uchiyama in Japanese and Jesse McCartney in English.|$|E
5|$|Sing's {{reputation}} {{resulted in}} a champion Turkish sniper, nicknamed 'Abdul the Terrible' by the Allied side, being assigned to deal with him. Tate alleges that the Turks were largely <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> Sing's sniping from that of other ANZAC soldiers, and that only the reports of incidents believed to be Sing's work were passed on to Abdul. Through analysis of the victims' actions and wounds, Abdul concluded that Sing's position was at Chatham's Post. After several days, Sing's spotter alerted him to a potential target, and he took aim, {{only to find the}} target—Abdul—looking in his direction. Sing prepared to fire, trying not to reveal his position, but the Turkish sniper noticed him and began his own firing sequence. Sing fired first and killed Abdul. Very shortly thereafter, the Turkish artillery fired on Sing's position—he and his spotter barely managed to evacuate from Chatham's Post alive.|$|E
