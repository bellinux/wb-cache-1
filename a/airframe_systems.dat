40|$|Air {{transport}} {{has been}} {{a key component of}} the socio-economic globalisation. The ever increasing demand for air travel and air transport {{is a testament to the}} success of the aircraft. But this growing demand presents many challenges. One of which is the environmental impact due to aviation. The scope of the environmental impact of aircraft can be discussed from many viewpoints. This research focuses on the environmental impact due to aircraft operation. Aircraft operation causes many environmental penalties. The most obvious is the fossil fuel based fuel burn and the consequent greenhouse gas emissions. Aircraft operations directly contribute to the CO 2 and NOX emissions among others. The dependency on a limited natural resource such as fossil fuel presents the case for fuel optimised operation. The by-products of burning fossil fuel some of which are considered pollutants and greenhouse gases, presents the case for emissions optimised operations. Moreover, when considering the local impact of aircraft operation, aircraft noise is recognised as a pollutant. Hence noise optimised aircraft operation needs to be considered with regards to local impacts. It is clear whichever the objective is, optimised operation is key to improving the efficiency of the aircraft. The operational penalties have many different contributors. The most obvious of which is the way an aircraft is flown. This covers the scope of aircraft trajectory and trajectory optimisation. However, the design of the aircraft contributes to the operational penalties as well. For example the more-electric aircraft is an improvement over the conventional aircraft in terms of overall efficiency. It has been proven by many studies that the more-electric concept is more fuel efficient than a comparable conventional aircraft. The classical approach to aircraft trajectory optimisation does not account for the fuel penalties caused due to <b>airframe</b> <b>systems</b> operation. Hence the classical approach cannot define a conventional aircraft from a more-electric aircraft. With the more-electric aircraft expected to be more fuel efficient it was clear that optimal operation for the two concepts would be different. This research presents a methodology that can be used to study optimised trajectories for more-electric aircraft. The study present preliminary evidence of the environmental impact due to <b>airframe</b> <b>systems</b> operation and establishes the basis for an enhanced approach to aircraft trajectory optimisation which include airframe system penalties within the optimisation loop. It then presents a suite of models, the individual modelling approaches and the validation to conduct the study. Finally the research presents analysis and comparisons between the classical approach where the aircraft has no penalty due to systems, the conventional aircraft and the more-electric aircraft. When the case studies were optimised for the minimum fuel burn operation, the conventional <b>airframe</b> <b>systems</b> accounted for a 16. 6 % increase in fuel burn for a short haul flight and 6. 24 % increase in fuel burn for a long haul flight. Compared to the conventional aircraft, the more electric aircraft had a 9. 9 % lower fuel burn in the short haul flight and 5. 35 % lower fuel burn in the long haul flight. However, the key result was that the optimised operation for the moreelectric aircraft was significantly different than the conventional aircraft. Hence this research contributes by presenting a methodology to bridge the gap between theoretical and real aircraft-applicable trajectory optimisation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison between}} two implementations of the Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings equation for airframe noise applications. <b>Airframe</b> <b>systems</b> are generally moving at constant speed and not rotating, so these conditions are used in the current investigation. Efficient and easily implemented forms of the equations applicable to subsonic, rectilinear motion of all acoustic sources are used. The assumptions allow the derivation of a simple form of the equations in the frequency-domain, and the time-domain method uses the restrictions on the motion to reduce the work required to find the emission time. The comparison between the frequency domain method and the retarded time formulation reveals some of the advantages of the different approaches. Both methods are still capable of predicting the far-field noise from nonlinear near-field flow quantities. Because of the large input data sets and potentially large numbers of observer positions of interest in three-dimensional problems, both codes utilize the message passing interface to divide the problem among different processors. Example problems are used to demonstrate the usefulness and efficiency of the two scheme...|$|E
40|$|Six {{material}} concepts at Mach 2. 0 {{and three}} material concepts at Mach 2. 55 were proposed. The resulting evaluations, based on projected development, production, and operating costs, indicate that aircraft designs with advanced composites {{as the primary}} material ingredient have the lowest fare premiums at both Mach 2. 0 and 2. 55. Designs having advanced metallics as the primary material ingredient are not economical. Advanced titanium, employing advanced manufacturing methods such as SFF/DB, requires a fare premium of about 30 percent at both Mach 2. 0 and 2. 55. Advanced aluminum, usable only at the lower Mach number, requires a fare premium of 20 percent. Cruise speeds in the Mach 2. 0 - 2. 3 regime are preferred because of the better economics {{and because of the}} availability of two material concepts to reduce program risk - advanced composites and advanced aluminums. This cruise speed regime also avoids the increase in risk associated with the more complex inlets and <b>airframe</b> <b>systems</b> and higher temperature composite matrices required at the higher Mach numbers typified by Mach 2. 55...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{with the}} rapid {{development}} of electric and electronic technology, the All-Electric Aircraft (AEA) concept has attracted more and more attention, which only utilizes the electric power instead of conventional hydraulic and pneumatic power to supply all the <b>airframe</b> <b>systems.</b> To meet the power requirements under various flight stages and operating conditions, the AEA approach {{has resulted in the}} current aircraft electrical power generation capacity up to 1. 6 MW. To satisfy the power quality and stability requirements, the advanced power electronic interfaces and more efficient power distribution systems must be investigated. Moreover, with the purpose of taking the full advantages of available electrical power, novel dynamic power distribution management research and design for an AEA must be carried out. The main objective of this thesis is to investigate and develop a methodology of more efficient power distribution management with the purpose of minimizing the rated power generating capacity and the mass of the electrical power system (EPS) including the power generation system and the power distribution system in an AEA. It is important to analyse and compare the subsistent electrical power distribution management approaches in current aircraft. Therefore the electrical power systems of A 320 and B 777, especially the power management system, will be discussed in this thesis. Most importantly the baseline aircraft, the Flying Crane is the outcome of the group design project. The whole project began in March 2008, and ended in September 2010, including three stages: conceptual design, preliminary design and detailed design. The dynamic power distribution management research is based on the power distribution system of the Flying Crane. The main task of the investigation is to analyse and manage the power usage among and inside typical <b>airframe</b> <b>systems</b> by using dynamic power distribution management method. The characteristics and operation process of these systems will be investigated in detail and thoroughly. By using the method of dynamic power distribution management, all the electrical consumers and sub-systems powered by electricity are managed effectively. The performance of an aircraft can be improved by reducing the peak load requirement on board. Furthermore, the electrical system architecture, distributed power distribution system and the dynamic power distribution management system for AEA are presented. Finally, the mass of the whole electrical power system is estimated and analysed carefully...|$|E

However, the concept of an AEE has been around for some years and yet has not been adopted to-date.
