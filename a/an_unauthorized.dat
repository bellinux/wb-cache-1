5|$|The NTSB report {{showed that}} the plane had several {{instances}} of maintenance work related to cabin pressure {{in the months leading}} up to the accident. The NTSB was unable to determine whether they stemmed from a common problem – replacements and repairs were documented, but not the pilot discrepancy reports that prompted them or the frequency of such reports. The report criticised Sunjet Aviation for the possibility that this would have made the problem harder to identify, track, and resolve; as well as the fact that in at least one instance the plane was flown with <b>an</b> <b>unauthorized</b> maintenance deferral for cabin pressure problems.|$|E

5|$|In 1965, {{seven years}} {{after the release of}} the {{original}} film, a student short film serving as <b>an</b> <b>unauthorized</b> sequel was made by amateur filmmaker Don Glut, after he discovered the Sun Demon mask in Bob Burns' collection.

While this was a deliberate decision by Microsoft to push sales of Vista, the game could be enabled to play on Windows XP through <b>an</b> <b>unauthorized</b> third-party patch. The game was ported by a small team at Microsoft Game Studios (codenamed Hired Gun) who worked closely with Bungie. As one of the launch titles of Games for Windows – Live, the game offered Live features not available in the Xbox version, such as guide support and achievements.

5|$|Coinage {{began on}} the first United States silver dollar, known as the Flowing Hair dollar, in 1794 {{following}} the construction and staffing of the Philadelphia Mint. The Coinage Act of 1792 called for the silver coinage to be struck in an alloy consisting of 89.2% silver and 10.8% copper. However, Mint officials were reluctant to strike coins with the unusual fineness, so {{it was decided to}} strike them in <b>an</b> <b>unauthorized</b> alloy of 90% silver instead. This caused depositors of silver to lose money when their metal was coined. During the second year of production of the Flowing Hair dollar, it was decided that the denomination would be redesigned. It is unknown what prompted this change or who suggested it, though numismatic historian R.W. Julian speculates that Henry William de Saussure, who was named Director of the Mint on July 9, 1795, may have suggested it, as he had stated a redesign of the American coinage as one of his goals before taking office. It is also possible that the Flowing Hair design was discontinued owing to much public disapproval.|$|E
5|$|Having worked {{together}} for communist {{organizations in the}} mid-1980s, Faeq al-Mir and Elias Atallah boasted a close relationship {{at the time of}} the arrest. Al-Mir, a human rights activist, led the left-wing People’s Democratic Party, <b>an</b> <b>unauthorized</b> party critical of the Syrian government. Atallah was the leader and sole parliamentarian of the Democratic Left Movement, a leftist Lebanese party. He was also a senior figure in the March 14 Alliance, a Lebanese parliamentary coalition critical of Syrian policies. The two conversed over the phone several times prior to the arrest. They often lamented the assassinations of anti-Syrian Lebanese figures like Samir Kassir. Al-Mir, who was released from a previous ten-year prison sentence related to political activism in 1999, visited Lebanon in 2006 to mourn the killing of George Hawi, a former leader of the Lebanese Communist Party. According to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, this contributed to al-Mir's arrest at the end of the year.|$|E
