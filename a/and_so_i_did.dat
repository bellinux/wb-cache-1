60|$|Limb. In {{good time}} be it spoken; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> Mrs Pleasance.|$|E
60|$|But {{there was}} nothing else to be done, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it. Very clumsily too, I fear.|$|E
60|$|I never {{pretended to}} {{understand}} Private Ortheris; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{the next best}} thing I left him alone.|$|E
6000|$|... "So I {{stretched}} {{out my hand}} first, but then I called out, 'I'd be burned in the flames before I could get within three yards of you.' So then he said, 'Well, help me with your prayers,' <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>so</b> <b>I</b> am at home--only <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not find}} <b>so</b> much of it. I walk about here, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> there; but here I see {{a variety of}} people in every street, and there I can only go and call on Mrs. Allen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} ought to know," [...] she said suddenly. [...] "You see, Charlie, Sir Marmaduke is very kind to me, and I love him dearly, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> you, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{think you ought}} to know, {{although}} it may be nothing at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. She told me afore that I should hear'n; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> They say she's {{clever and}} deep, and perhaps she charmed 'en to come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I'll {{drive to}} the nearest police station,' I answered; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> leaving him {{shivering}} on the pavement. There I gave up my fare, {{and that was the}} last I ever saw of him." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{never had}} the heart to throw cold water on Euphemia's noble emotions, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not tell her that the notice merely {{requested}} travellers to remove from their trunks the anciennes etiquettes, or old railway labels.|$|E
6000|$|Bella: [...] "I {{know you}} like to have me always speak the truth, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> to you, ma'am, and every lady I ever lived with; but I wasn't going to have that young {{waitress}} of Mrs. Baker's and that nasty cook of Mrs. Merrick's laughing at us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{want to see}} him,' said Marie. Lady Carbury, hardly {{knowing what}} answer to make, {{was silent for a}} while. 'I suppose he told you everything;--didn't he? You know that we were to have been married? I loved him very much, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> still. <b>I</b> am not ashamed of coming and telling you.' ...|$|R
5000|$|All things {{still look}} {{well for a}} {{favorable}} conclusion to the war.I {{do not expect to}} see it ended so speedily as many suppose, but patience will carry us through. I thought of you before I got up this morning, saying to myself, [...] "Darling Lucy, <b>I</b> love you <b>so</b> much," [...] <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> Affectionately, R.|$|R
60|$|CUSINS. It is true. You {{accused me}} yourself, Lady Brit, {{of joining the}} Army to worship Barbara; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> She bought my soul like a flower at a street corner; but she bought it for herself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because, I {{recalled}} {{what the}} son of Sirach says in the True Book: 'An enemy speaketh sweetly with his lips;' <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> what {{the son of}} Sirach advises in such cases: 'I believed not his many words.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I got to Mr. Charlecote,' said Robert--an {{answer that}} thrilled her all over. 'I said I'd be always very good, {{if he would}} take care of me, and not let them frighten me. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> go to sleep.' ...|$|E
60|$|Amid. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> will <b>do</b> still; (<b>I</b> must feign courage, There is {{no other}} way.) [Aside.|$|R
6000|$|... "Father, I {{belong to}} a society of three, and we have promised to do all we can for temperance. As yet I can only show bravely the faith that is in me; {{therefore}} I can never offer any friend of mine a drop of wine, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not ask them here, where it would seem most uncourteous to refuse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn’t say {{she took}} it," [...] snapped his wife. [...] "I said I believe she knows {{something}} about it, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> She’s a horrid woman. Look at the way she encouraged her girl Looey to run after that young traveller from Smithson’s. The whole {{fact of the matter}} is, it isn’t your brooch, so you don’t care." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{answer to}} my {{question}} he motioned for me to follow, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> with such good avail that within a quarter-hour I was in my father's arms, he pressing me to his heart as if I had just come out from some terrible danger.|$|E
60|$|She {{remained}} {{for a time}} looking down at me and, I could feel, perplexed by me, but I {{wanted to go on}} with my thinking, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not look up, and presently she stooped to my forehead and kissed me and went rustling softly to her room.|$|E
60|$|I {{spoke for}} him, as his interpreter, to my comrades, {{and in their}} names thanked him; but, {{speaking}} to them in Portuguese, I desired them to defer the acceptance of his kindness to the next morning; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> telling him we would further talk of this part in the morning; so we parted for that time.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's no {{time like}} the present, when I've {{got it in}} my mind; and, if you'll wait, I can settle it all for you to-night. I was telling you that <b>I</b> hate farming, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> There are thirty or five-and-thirty acres of land about the house, and lying round {{to the back of}} the town; you shall take them off my hands, and welcome." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, my dear," [...] said Lily, [...] "you allow yourself, for {{the sake}} of your argument, to use a word in a double sense, and you attempt to {{confound}} me by <b>doing</b> <b>so.</b> But <b>I</b> am a great deal too clever for you, and have thought too much about it, to be taken in in that way. I certainly love your cousin John; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> love Mr. Boyce, the vicar." ...|$|R
40|$|I tend to wax poetic {{about my}} research. Generally, I {{like to have}} {{background}} material summarized for me, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> the same here. If you are interested only in the results and problems I consider, or only those problems in a particular section, please feel free to skip around- all of my theorems are clearly labelled as such, and I have a section {{at the end of}} the work for future problems I wish to consider. 2...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't tell me of no rules, Miss Rachel, {{as would}} cut a poor child {{off from her}} friends as her mother gave her to on her death-bed. 'Sally,' says she, 'I know you will do a mother's part by that poor little maid;' <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> till I was over persuaded {{to let her go}} to that there place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There wasn't {{any other}} way to do it, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it this way," [...] he said. [...] "I'm sorry, really, to have to tie you up so, because I wouldn't like it myself, and I wouldn't have put that {{handkerchief}} over your mouth if you had agreed to keep quiet, but I don't want anybody coming in here until you've promised." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Eighteen pounds six ounces,” {{said our}} friend, rising and taking down his coat. “Yes,” he continued, “it wur sixteen year ago, come the third o’ next month, that I landed him. I caught him {{just below the}} bridge with a minnow. They told me he wur in the river, and I said I’d have him, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> You don’t see many fish that size about here now, I’m thinking. Good-night, gentlemen, good-night.” ...|$|E
60|$|Before we sailed I {{wrote to}} Sir Alexander telling him exactly how things stood, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> think <b>did</b> his son, {{though he never}} showed me the letter.|$|R
30|$|He {{bought a}} fork, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>did</b> <b>I.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "And if {{you look}} at the time frame for these three books--William Carlos Williams, Man Ray, Thomas Edison--they all begin sort of in the last vestiges of the {{industrial}} era and the romantic era in culture and they pass through the cataclysm of the wars and they end up sort of on the threshold of--of our day. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> think they all connect, even though on first blush it is--it's hard to see the connection, but I think there is a connection." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{knew who}} she was then, and Madame de Montausier told me I was right; but that I must keep the secret; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> till after Queen Anne of Austria was dead. She would not let her rank deprive her of the {{privilege}} of waiting on the poor, unknown and unthanked; and many hours, when those who blamed her for indolence supposed her to be in bed, she was attending the hospital.|$|E
60|$|More than once, after I {{was very}} tired, I gave up taking her alive, {{and was going}} to shoot her, but I never did it, {{although}} it was my right, for I did not believe I could hit her; and besides, she always stopped and posed, when I raised the gun, and this made me suspicious that she knew about me and my marksmanship, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not care to expose myself to remarks.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, that note; I {{wrote it}} in one of my impetuous fits. Maurice used to say I ran frantic, and grew irrational, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know what I was saying to you; and I brought that poor patient girl up here in all the heat, and the journey hurt her so much, that I don't know how we shall ever get her home again. Oh, Edmund, I am the worst wife and mother in the world; and I {{undertook}} it all with such foolish confidence.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I daresay she <b>did.</b> <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> suppose <b>did</b> Mabel Grex. <b>I</b> {{had thought}} that perhaps I might make Mabel a confidante, but--" [...] Then she looked up into his face.|$|R
6000|$|Then father stood up, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>did</b> <b>I.</b> <b>So</b> <b>did</b> the two men--the {{clerk and}} the {{shorthand}} writer. Father {{did not say}} a word till we got out into the street. We walked along, and presently we passed an open gate into the fields. He turned back, saying to me: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{see nothing}} squeamish about it. But I know you're {{determined}} {{to leave it}} to me, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>do</b> it. <b>I</b> don't believe Mr. Breckon will think it's queer or squeamish." ...|$|R
