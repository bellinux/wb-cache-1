5|$|The worst {{loss of life}} in United States history due to a {{wildfire}} {{occurred in}} 1871 when the Peshtigo Fire swept through Wisconsin, killing more than 1500 people. The Santiago Canyon Fire of 1889 in California and especially the Great Fire of 1910 in Montana and Idaho contributed to the philosophy that fire was <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>that</b> needed to be suppressed. The Great Fire of 1910 burned , destroyed a number of communities and killed 86 people, and this event prompted various land management agencies to emphasize wildfire suppression. U.S. Government land agencies, including the National Park Service, generally followed the fire management policies established by the U.S. Forest Service, which oversees {{the majority of the}} nation's forestlands.|$|E
5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to act similar to the mythological dragon: {{as soon as he}} saw bad weather approaching, which he knew was brought by an ala, he would leave whatever he was doing, and fly up to confront the demon. This he did by falling into a deep sleep, or entering a state similar to death, usually at the very spot where he happened to be at that time. His soul then left his body in the form of a snake or a lizard, and soared skywards. It was claimed that he was not breathing as long as his soul was absent from his body. The battle could last for a whole day, or even for several days, during which time the man lay unconscious, sweating profusely from the exertion of the fight. There was <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>that,</b> during the course of the battle, the ala might approach the man's body and harm him, which could be prevented by someone swinging a blade above him, or by sticking the blade at the lying man's head. He should not be pushed or moved while in this state: if he was not in the same position as when he fell asleep, his soul would not be able to return into his body, and he would die. When he woke up after the battle with the ala, he was very tired. Apart from these characteristics, the dragon man was seen as an ordinary human.|$|E

25|$|Even if the guardsmen faced danger, {{it was not}} <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>that</b> {{called for}} lethal force. The 61 shots by 28 guardsmen {{certainly}} cannot be justified. Apparently, no order to fire was given, and there was inadequate fire control discipline on Blanket Hill. The Kent State tragedy must mark the last time that, {{as a matter of}} course, loaded rifles are issued to guardsmen confronting student demonstrators.|$|E

25|$|In {{his speech}} to WJC delegates, Orbán {{condemned}} the rise in anti-Semitism in Hungary and in Europe more widely.

The WJC said in reaction that Orbán had not confronted {{the true nature of}} the problem. “We regret that Mr. Orbán did not address any recent anti-Semitic or racist incidents in the country, nor did he provide sufficient reassurance that a clear line has been drawn between his government and the far-right fringe,” a WJC spokesman said afterwards.|$|E

25|$|According to Gordon Fletcher, Keynes' General Theory {{provided}} a conceptual justification for New Deal-type policies which was {{lacking in the}} established economics of the day. This was immensely significant, as {{in the absence of}} a proper theoretical underpinning there was <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>that</b> ad hoc policies of moderate intervention would be overtaken by extremist solutions, as had already happened in much of Europe. However, Keynes did not agree with all aspects of the New Deal; he considered that the almost immediate revival of business activity after the program's launch could only be accounted for by dangerous-to-rely-on psychological factors, such as the boost to confidence effected by Roosevelt's inspiring oratory.|$|E
25|$|In January 2013, the Architect of the Capitol {{announced}} a four-year, $10 million project to repair and conserve the Capitol Dome's exterior and the Capitol rotunda. The proposal {{would require the}} stripping of lead paint from {{the interior of the}} dome, repair to the ironwork, repainting of the interior of the dome, rehabilitation of the interstitial space between the dome and rotunda, and installation of new lighting in the interstitial space and the rotunda. The dome and rotunda, which were last conserved in 1960, are showing significant signs of rust and disrepair. There is <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>that</b> decorative ironwork could fall from the rotunda to the space below, and that weather-related problems could damage the artwork in the rotunda. Without immediate repair, safety netting will be installed (blocking the rotunda's artwork from view).|$|E
25|$|Contemporary black {{commentators}} {{argued that}} to white audiences, Connelly's The Green Pastures simply reinforced {{the notion that}} black people presented <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>that</b> needed to be contained. Weisenfeld argues that {{this is also the}} case with Freleng's parody. To white viewers in the 1930s, the film's implication that blacks care for nothing but gambling, drinking, and dancing only reinforces notions of the dangers posed by urban blacks. According to Goldmark, the choice of performers caricatured is telling; that Armstrong and Calloway are depicted as angels indicates that their crossover appeal was strong enough among whites that white audiences would not have felt threatened by the notion that they were angels in Heaven. Weisenfeld notes that by focusing the narrative on Saint Peter and his Stepin Fetchit underling, the animators ducked the potential offense white audiences might have felt upon seeing a black God.|$|E

25|$|After the battle, Ostorius was honoured with triumphal {{insignia}} but {{the victory}} did not entirely quell {{resistance in the}} Welsh borders. The Silures especially continued to harass Roman troops, supposedly after Ostorius had publicly said that they posed such <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>that</b> they should be either exterminated or transplanted. A large legionary force occupied in building forts in Siluran territory was surrounded and attacked and only rescued with difficulty and considerable loss. This violent desperation {{on the part of}} the Silures can be attributed to their reaction to what Peter Salway calls Ostorius' lack of political judgement. The Silures had been galvanised by Ostorius' ill-thought out threats to destroy them and began taking Roman prisoners as hostages and distributing them amongst their neighbouring tribes. This had the effect of binding them all together and creating a new resistance movement.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{doctrine}} of Valentinus, as described by , the youngest Aeon Sophia, in her passion to comprehend the Father of all, runs the danger of being absorbed into his essence, from which she is saved by coming {{in contact with the}} limiting power Horos, whose function it is to strengthen all things outside the ineffable Greatness, by confining each to its appointed place. According to this version Horos was a previously existing power; but according to another, and apparently a later account, Horos is an Aeon only generated on this occasion at the request of all the Aeons, who implored the Father to avert <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>that</b> threatened to affect them all. Then (as Hippolytus tells the story, vi. 31) he directs the production of a new pair of Aeons, Christ and the Holy Spirit, who restore order by separating from the Pleroma the unformed offspring of Sophia. After this Horos is produced in order to secure the permanence of the order thus produced. Irenaeus (u. s.) reverses this order, and Horos is produced first, afterwards the other pair.|$|E

A small success came in December {{with the publication of}} [...] "Red Ripe's Squaw" [...] in Century Magazine, it was an abridged version of the Iron Teeth narrative. At the end of February 1929 Marquis received a much-needed payment of $150 for this work.|$|E

500|$|Marsh and {{his club}} sought a speedy {{resolution}} to the problem because Sheffield Shield matches were due to begin {{in a matter of}} weeks. They perceived <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>that</b> other umpires in the Sydney competition would follow Curran's lead and call Marsh, effectively outlawing him, resulting in the loss of the club's leading strike bowler. By wearing the splints, Marsh showed his belief that Curran would call him on the second day. This never happened, because Curran withdrew from his position by the luncheon adjournment on the second day, believing that he had been humiliated. Curran's resignation was widely criticised by the media and he was reprimanded by the First Grade Committee for his action. Bowling [...] "as fast as ever", Marsh went on to finish with 6/125 from 33 overs as New South Wales were bowled out for 320.|$|E
500|$|In April 1977, Alyeska filed {{a notice}} that it {{intended}} to start filling the pipeline sometime between June 20 and July 1. Engineers {{had to face}} several problems when filling the pipeline. First was the need to balance temperatures: Filled by air, the steel pipeline was about [...] degrees. The oil emerging from wells at Prudhoe Bay was more than [...] degrees, and there was <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>that</b> if it was introduced before intermediate warming, the pipeline could crack because of thermal expansion. The second problem came when the pipeline needed to be purged of air {{in order to reduce}} the danger of fire or explosion. Usually, a pipeline is filled with water first, and the oil pushes the water ahead of it, purging the pipeline as it goes. In Alaska, there was a fear that the water would freeze in the pipeline, damaging it. This problem was solved when pressurized nitrogen was used instead of water.|$|E
500|$|The Montreal Laboratory {{investigated}} multiple {{avenues of}} reactor development. One was a homogeneous reactor, {{in which a}} uranium compound was dissolved in heavy water to form a slurry, or a [...] "mayonnaise" [...] as the Montreal team called it. This offered various advantages for cooling, control {{and the ability to}} draw off plutonium that was produced. Paneth, Goldschmidt and others experimented with methods of preparing such a uranium compound, but none could be found with the required density. They considered using enriched uranium, but it was unavailable. Attention then turned to a heterogeneous reactor, in which a lattice of uranium metal rods were immersed in heavy water. While much less heavy water would be required, there was <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>that</b> the water would decompose into deuterium and oxygen—a potentially explosive combination. There was great interest in breeder reactors, which could breed plutonium from uranium or uranium-233 from thorium, as it was believed that uranium was scarce. A process was devised for separating the uranium from thorium.|$|E
