Mechanical noise {{caused by}} power {{equipment}} vibration {{is the main}} source of underwater radiated noise of the ship, and vibration isolation and noise reduction of ship equipment has been widely concerned. Therefore，a vibration isolation system designed for four sets <b>of</b> <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> <b>of</b> ship cabin was investigated in the paper, aimed to further reveal the influence of various parameters including floating raft shell thickness, excitation source, and different ship hull and installation platform thickness on the vibration level difference of system. The results obtained from numerical analysis using MSC software and experiment indicate that one-dimensional spring element simplified can properly simulate the actual rubber vibration isolator on low frequency bands, and increasing thickness of flat, hull and platform can improve the effect of vibration isolation obviously...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the important requirement for ship propulsion necessary for its immaculate operation, since any failure can endanger {{the ship and}} render it useless.

Therefore the paper presents preliminary investigations for setting up models of reliable ship propulsion accounting for the failure <b>of</b> <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engines.</b> Models <b>of</b> most frequent implementations of electrical energy generating systems are defi ned, analysed and their infl uences assessed. Based on simulation results, analyses of the models and data from relevant data bases on ship machinery arrangements and failures, possible solutions for improving ship propulsion reliability are presented. An analysis of proposed possibilities leads us to the conclusion {{that it is necessary to}} defi ne a new model for reliable ship propulsion including auxiliary mashines...|$|R
