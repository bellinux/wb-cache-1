40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to focus on unique issues that are {{encountered}} in the crosscultural <b>adaptation</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> of emotions. We take into consideration the cross-cultural equivalence of the concept of emotion, and how cultural differences influence the meaning of words that are utilized to describe these concepts. The critical need to take the state-trait distinction into account in adapting measures of emotional states and personality traits is then discussed. The effects of language and culture in adapting measures of the experience, expression, and control of anger in Latin-America are also reviewed. The construction of the Latin American Multicultural State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory is described. </p...|$|E

In one study [34], a CRC screening questionnaire was translated into Hindi and Gujarati using a bilingual-bicultural committee translation approach derived from translation methods proposed by Harkness and Mohler [35]. Likewise, in another study [36], a CRC screening survey assessed behaviours among English speaking SA’s in New York/New Jersey, but no information was provided on whether it was culturally adapted for this SA population. The use of cross-cultural cognitive interviewing [10] in this study enhanced rigor, and provided details to guide future scholarly work.|$|E
40|$|Psychopathy {{is one of}} {{the most}} studied {{personality}} disorders, in terms of the negative impact that the behaviors associated with this disorder — particularly, the criminal behavior — have in the community where the individual lives. The aim of this article is to present a comprehensive literature review on psychopathy, focusing some difficulties related to its concept, assessment, and intervention. Here, psychopathy is presented as a construct resulting from decades of clinical and empirical research, and whose dimensional nature justifies the possibility of assessing the general population. Studies indicate that psychopathy is manifested in a number of behaviors resulting from biological and personality factors related to a series of family history and environmental factors. We emphasize the need for more empirical research on psychopathy in the general population in Portugal, regarding the development and <b>adaptation</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> of the construct...|$|E

40|$|Few {{educational}} {{campaigns have}} focused on bowel cancer, though {{studies have indicated that}} members of the community need and want current information about relevant issues. In order to facilitate research in this area, reliable and valid measures of community attitudes are needed. Content validity of a survey instrument was obtained through use of a Delphi process with Directors of Education from the Australia Cancer Council and focus group discussions with informed members of the public. The subsequent survey of community perceptions about colorectal cancer included a broad range of content areas related to the risk of bowel cancer, preventing and coping with bowel cancer and beliefs about susceptibility and severity. The construct validity of these content areas was investigated by use of a factor analysis and confirmation of an association with related predictor variables. Two measures related to personal influence and anticipated coping responses showed favourable psychometric properties, including moderate to high levels of internal consistency and test-retest reliability. A test of the concurrent validity of these measures requires further development of instruments related to colorectal cancer or <b>adaptation</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> from other areas of health research.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the psychometric properties}} of the quality of life-Alzheimer disease (QOL-AD) Chinese version in patients with dementia in mainland, China and to compare patient and caregiver reports of patient QOL. Methods: The QOL-AD Chinese version was established following standard guidelines for cross-cultural <b>adaptation</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures.</b> The reliability was assessed by internal consistency and test–retest reliability. The validity included construct and convergent validity. A paired Stu-dent t test was performed to determine differences between patient reports and caregiver reports. Results: The reliability for both patient and caregiver reports on the QOL-AD was good (Cronbach a values of 0. 66 and 0. 87; intraclass correlation coefficients of 0. 84 and 0. 90 for patient and caregiver reports, respectively). The validity of patient and caregiver reports was supported by corre-lation with domain measures. All of the multitrait-multimethod correlations demonstrated a high relationship between patient reports and caregiver reports, ranging from 0. 26 to 0. 55. The caregivers rated patient QOL significantly higher than did the patients. Conclusion: The findings support the use of the Chinese version of the QOL-AD as a generic instrument to measure QOL of AD in mainland China.

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to develop and {{evaluate}} psychometric properties of the Clinical Decision Making Style (CDMS) scale which measures general preferences for decision making as well as preferences regarding the provision of information to the patient from the perspectives of people with severe mental illness and staff. Methods A participatory approach was chosen for instrument development which followed 10 sequential steps proposed in a current guideline of good practice for the translation and cultural <b>adaptation</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures.</b> Following item analysis, reliability, validity, and long-term stability of the CDMS were examined using Spearman correlations in a sample of 588 people with severe mental illness and 213 mental health professionals in 6 European countries (Germany, UK, Italy, Denmark, Hungary, and Switzerland). Results In both patient and staff versions, the two CDMS subscales “Participation in Decision Making” and “Information” reliably measure distinct characteristics of decision making. Validity could be demonstrated to some extent, but needs further investigation. Conclusions Together with two other five-language patient- and staff-rated measures developed in the CEDAR study (ISRCTN 75841675) – “Clinical Decision Making in Routine Care” and “Clinical Decision Making Involvement and Satisfaction” – the CDMS allows empirical investigation of the complex relation between clinical decision making and outcome in the treatment of people with severe mental illness across Europe. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Performance on neurocognitive tasks {{develops}} with age, but it {{is still}} unknown whether this performance differs between children from different cultures. We compared cross-sectionally the development of neurocognitive functions in 3 - to 15 -year-old children from three countries: Finland, Italy, and the United States (N= 2745). Methods: Language, face memory, emotion recognition, theory of mind, and visuospatial processing subtests from the NEPSY-II standardizations in Finland, Italy, and the United States were used to evaluate if children and adolescents from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds differ in performance on these measures. Results: We found significant differences in performance on the tasks between the countries. Generally, the differences were more pronounced in the younger age groups. Some subtests showed greater country effects than others, performance on these subtests being higher, in general, in one country over the others, or showed different patterns of age associated changes in test performance. Conclusions: Significant differences in neurocognitive performance between children from Finland, Italy, and the United States were found. These findings may be due to cultural or educational differences that impact test performance, or due to factors associated with the <b>adaptation</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> from one culture to another. The finding of performance differences across countries on similar tasks indicate that cross-cultural and background variables impact performance on neuropsychological measures. Therefore, clinicians need to consider a child’s cultural background when evaluating performance on neuropsychological assessments. The results also indicate that future cross-cultural studies are needed to further examine the underlying cultural factors that influence neurocognitive performance. (JINS, 2017, 23, 1 – 14...|$|E

This study used a cross-sectional design to cross-culturally adapt the MASTp following the guidelines for the process of cross-cultural <b>adaptation</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures.</b> A total of 40 subjects (20 patients with post-stroke aphasia and 20 healthy subjects) were included. The MASTp was tested for floor or ceiling effects, internal consistency reliability, intra-rater reliability, discriminative validity, and factor structure. There were no floor or ceiling effects for MASTp total score. The MASTp yielded values for internal consistency reliability that were not adequate (Cronbach's alpha 0. 64 and 0. 66 for test and retest, respectively. The intra-rater reliability of the MASTp within a 7 day-interval was excellent for total score (ICC agreement = 0. 96) and both expressive index (ICC = 0. 95) and receptive index (ICC agreement = 0. 98). here were statistically significant differences in MASTp total scores and both indexes between patients and healthy subjects suggesting the discriminative validity of the MASTp (P < 0. 001). Factor analysis revealed a 3 -factor solution, which jointly accounted for 72. 06 % of the total variance. Additional factor analysis suggested 6 -item MASTp as a unidimensional measure.

The objective {{of this study is}} to create a framework for assessing institutional preconditions that enable or constrain climate change adaptation measures in agriculture and to apply the framework to a case study in agriculture. We adopted and modified the Procedure for Institutional Compatibility Assessment (PICA). Institutions in our framework are characterized by a set of crucial institutional preconditions (CIPs) and indicators linked to each CIP. CIPs refer to both institutional incentives and constraints for implementation <b>of</b> <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures</b> (here to climate change). We applied a combination of ranking and scoring techniques based on information from workshops, interviews and a literature review to assess institutional incentives and constraints for adaptation measures, together indicating the institutional feasibility <b>of</b> implementation <b>of</b> <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures.</b> We selected and assessed three adaptation measures relevant to agriculture in Flevoland, a province in the Netherlands: (1) improvement of water management and irrigation facilities; (2) relocation of farms; and (3) development of new crop varieties. The two main constraining CIPs for the implementation <b>of</b> the <b>measures</b> were found to be (1) heterogeneity of actors’ interests and (2) availability of resources. Based on the institutional feasibility analysis, the implementation of water management and improvement of irrigation facilities will potentially face fewer institutional constraints compared to the other two measures.

This study analyzes and compares the vulnerability of tree and loop systems under various rainfall events to structural failure represented by pipe blockage. Different pipe blockage scenarios, in which one of the pipes in an urban drainage network is assumed to be blocked individually, are constructed and their impacts on the network are simulated under different storm events. Furthermore, a vulnerability index is defined to <b>measure</b> the vulnerability <b>of</b> the drainage systems before and after the implementation <b>of</b> <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures.</b> The results obtained indicate that the tree systems have a relatively larger proportion of critical hydraulic pipes than the loop systems, thus the vulnerability of tree systems is substantially greater than that of the loop systems. Furthermore, the vulnerability index of tree systems is reduced after they are converted into a loop system with the implementation <b>of</b> <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures.</b> This paper provides an insight into the differences in the vulnerability of tree and loop systems, and provides more evidence for development <b>of</b> <b>adaptation</b> <b>measures</b> (e. g., tanks) to reduce urban flooding...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 90 - 93) This thesis {{suggests that}} Bertolt Brecht's play, Round Heads and Pointed Heads, has been underserved both critically and theatrically. Although it {{evolved from a}} previous attempt Brecht made to adapt Shakespeare's play Measure for Measure, {{there has been little}} scholarly discussion of Round Heads and Pointed Heads in light of its Shakespearean original. It is the intention of this thesis to revisit Brecht's play and argue that a comparative analysis of the two plays serves to rescue Brecht's play from its reputation as a failed Nazi satire and a na'ive Marxist account of the rise of fascism in Germany. This thesis also proposes that a study of Brecht's early, incomplete attempt to adapt Measure for Measure, which exists in the Bertolt Brecht Archives in fragmented form, strengthens the link between Round Heads and Pointed Heads and Shakespeare's play. I have included a working translation of these manuscript pages, which comprise the appendix to this thesis. Identifying Round heads and Pointed Heads as Brecht's final, free <b>adaptation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Measure</b> for Measure encourages a critical re-evaluation of the play, rescuing it from its reputation as an anti-Hitler satire and resurrecting it as a complex and sophisticated political parable with multiple implications...|$|R
