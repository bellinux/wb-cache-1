5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like I am going to be happy.|$|E

25|$|Fowler bowled his off spin well, {{with bad}} luck, often beating the batsman but failing {{to take the}} edge and then missing the wicket. Steel's length was not perfect, but he bowled his leg spin for his field and was not <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> hit. Lister-Kaye was perhaps {{the best of the}} bowlers, and Manners the best of the fielders, at cover-point. Lubbock let through 18 byes, mostly off the turning {{deliveries}} of Fowler.

25|$|Grobbelaar was {{retained}} by three of Liverpool's greatest managers; Paisley, Fagan and Dalglish, {{over a period}} of 13 years. His strengths were his gymnastic-like agility, and an unflappable confidence.

Over the course of his Liverpool career he won more medals than any of his contemporaries.|$|E

[...] In fact, Rincewind's head holds one of the eight spells from the Octavo, the most powerful spellbook in the Discworld, and he has been unable to learn others because [...] "they were <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in the same head" [...] as the Octavo spell. [...] Rincewind is forced by the Patrician of Ankh-Morpork to act as a local guide for Twoflower, a property insurance salesman and the Discworld's first tourist, who is visiting Ankh-Morpork, and Twoflower's luggage, which is made from Sapient Pearwood and can run on its own legs.|$|E

500|$|Not all {{the songs}} from the album explore social issues. The songs [...] "I Wanna Be Your Lush" [...] and [...] "Too Famous" [...] use satire to criticise the {{superior}} attitudes of male musicians, while [...] "Husband" [...] disapproves [...] "gruff and pushy" [...] boyfriends. The band also clarified that they have nothing against men. As Rootes notes, [...] "Men are great! We love them! We're talking about dickhead men, not all men." [...] The band considered themselves more of a pro-girl band than a feminist band. Rootes told Select: [...] "So many girls are <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> girls. Apart from Courtney Love, who's really feminine and uses her sexuality and is a strong woman. I don't think women should dress like boys. That's what's great about PJ Harvey. She was boyish and now she's gone really glam. She looks amazing and she's become an icon: a real woman." ...|$|E
500|$|After a short hiatus {{from acting}} {{following}} {{the birth of}} her two children, Watts returned to acting in 2009, starring alongside Clive Owen in the political thriller The International. She played a Manhattan assistant district attorney who partners with an Interpol agent to take down a merchant bank. The picture was well received by critics, and grossed over US$60million (equivalent to $ million in [...] ) worldwide. The same year, she appeared in the drama Mother and Child, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. She portrayed the role of Elizabeth, a lawyer who never knew her biological mother. Watts co-starred the film along with Annette Bening, Kerry Washington and Samuel L. Jackson. Mother and Child received mainly favourable reviews, with ViewLondon remarking that Watts [...] "is terrific as Elizabeth, delivering a powerful performance that [...] isn't <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unsympathetic".

The Prince George character was created as a new [...] "incompetent sidekick" [...] for the title character. He was modelled after George IV of the United Kingdom, who served as Prince Regent between 1811 and 1820. Laurie had previously guest starred in the final two episodes of Blackadder II, and the producers decided to cast him in the role of Prince George. Laurie's physical appearance differed significantly from George IV's appearance, who was obese during the time of his regency. Writers Ben Elton and Richard Curtis were unfazed by this, referring to George as [...] "a fat, flatulent [...] ", an appropriate description for the real Prince rather than Laurie.|$|E

There is no requirement that teachers include Seacole in their lessons. At the end of 2012 it was reported that Mary Seacole was to be removed from the National Curriculum. Opposing this, Greg Jenner, historical consultant to [...] Horrible Histories, has stated that while her medical achievements have been exaggerated, removing Seacole from the curriculum would be a mistake. While Peter Hitchens has argued that Seacole's accomplishments have been exaggerated because anybody who put a contrary view was <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> accused of racism, both Jenner and Hugh Muir have asserted that this is not the case. Susan Sheridan has argued that the leaked proposal to remove Seacole from the National Curriculum is part of [...] "a concentration solely on large-scale political and military history and a fundamental shift away from social history." [...] In The Daily Telegraph, Cathy Newman argues that Michael Gove's plans for the new history curriculum [...] "could mean the only women children learn anything about will be queens".|$|E
