50|$|The Lightnings' engines were {{troubled by}} the {{addition}} of alcohol used as an <b>anti-knock</b> <b>compound</b> in their fuel supply; a British war economy solution which caused problems with water condensation on the ground and fuel line icing at altitude. Another British attempt to correct fuel composition caused lead metal deposits to coat cylinders and foul plugs throughout the squadron. The -H series Lightnings did not have adequate cooling for extended high-power usage, as their engine development had outstripped the cooling capacity of the integral intercooler which ran through the wing's leading edge. Pilots were instructed to restrict their periods of highest engine power to defined time limits, but many did not. As a result of these various influences, the Group's Lightnings suffered a high rate of attrition. Nevertheless, 55FG P-38H pilots provided cover for missions against aircraft plants during Big Week in February 1944. Lt. Col. Jack Jenkins led the group on 3 March 1944, when they became the first Allied fighters to reach Berlin on an escort mission.|$|E

50|$|The T-head was {{rendered}} obsolete in {{the passenger}} car market {{by a combination of}} engine advances made in World War I and the introduction of effective <b>anti-knock</b> <b>compounds</b> such as tetraethyl lead in the early 1920s. When combined, these advances made flathead engines just as reliable as T-heads while also being more powerful, lighter, more fuel efficient, and cheaper to manufacture. The T-heads' incredible reliability did however keep them in service in heavy equipment, large trucks, and fire trucks until they were finally phased out of production in the 1950s.|$|R
5000|$|Midgley {{began working}} at General Motors in 1916. In December 1921, while {{working under the}} {{direction}} of Charles Kettering at Dayton Research Laboratories, a subsidiary of General Motors, Midgley discovered that the addition of Tetraethyllead to gasoline prevented [...] "knocking" [...] in internal combustion engines. The company named the substance [...] "Ethyl", avoiding all mention of lead in reports and advertising. Oil companies and automobile manufacturers, especially General Motors which owned the patent jointly filed by Kettering and Midgley, promoted the TEL additive as a superior alternative to ethanol or ethanol-blended fuels, on which they could make very little profit. In December 1922, the American Chemical Society awarded Midgley the 1923 Nichols Medal for the [...] "Use of <b>Anti-Knock</b> <b>Compounds</b> in Motor Fuels". This was the first of several major awards he earned during his career.|$|R
40|$|Besides the {{negative}} ecological consequences, during {{the production of}} the motor petrol (alkyl lead as <b>antiâ€“knock</b> <b>compound),</b> as well as the application (combustion in motor engines), there are the ecological consequences manifested by deposition of Pb in the soil beside the motorway. At the same time {{this is the end of}} the life cycle of the petrol. However, Pb enters the human consumption chain through the plants that absorb Pb from the soil, and it is also deposited in the human body. The series of analyses of the cabbage head, outer leaves and soil includes left and right sides of the motorway of each of the control points, at the distance of 1 m, 2 m, 5 m, 10 m, 100 m, and 400 m from the motorway, each distance on the left and right side of the motorway. The results are shown in mg Pb/kg of the sample. The quantity of Pb shows decreasing effect when the distance from the motorway, is increased...|$|E
