5000|$|This fantastical dream leads Hanold {{on a real}} {{journey to}} Rome, Naples, and {{ultimately}} Pompeii, where, amazingly, he sees the Gradiva of his bas-relief stepping calmly and buoyantly across the lava stepping-stones. He follows her, loses her, then finds her sitting on the low steps between two pillars. He greets her in Latin, only to be answered, [...] "If you wish to speak to me, you must do so in German." [...] When he addresses {{her as if she}} were the girl of his dream, however, she looks at him without comprehension, gets up and leaves. Hanold calls out after her, [...] "Are you coming <b>here</b> <b>again</b> <b>tomorrow</b> in the noon hour?" [...] But she does not turn round, gives no answer, and a few moments later disappears round the corner. Hanold hurries after her, but she is nowhere to be seen. What follows is his quest to determine whether the woman he has seen is real or a delusion.|$|R
