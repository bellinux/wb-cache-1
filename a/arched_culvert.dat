40|$|Iowa's {{secondary}} road network contains nearly 15, 000 bridges which are less than 12 m (40 ft) long. Many of these bridges were built several decades ago {{and need to be}} replaced. Box culvert construction has proven to be an adequate bridge replacement technique. An alternative to box culverts is the Air-O-Form method of <b>arch</b> <b>culvert</b> construction. The Air-O-Form method has several potential advantages over box culvert construction. The new technique uses inflated balloons as the interior form in the construction of an <b>arch</b> <b>culvert.</b> Concrete is then shotcreted onto the balloon form to complete the <b>arch</b> <b>culvert.</b> The objective of the research project was to construct an air formed <b>arch</b> <b>culvert</b> to determine its applicability as an alternative county bridge replacement technique. The project had the following results: (1) The Air-O-Form method can be used to construct a structurally sound arch culvert; and (2) The method must become more economical if it is to compete with box culverts...|$|R
40|$|The Swedish Transport Administration in Norr- and VÃ¤sterbotten has {{observed}} many problems with bottomless <b>arch</b> <b>culverts</b> with a span less {{or equal to}} two meters. Up until now the focus has been the environmental improvements, mainly to enhance fish migration, and less respect has been given the technical requirements for the construction. To learn about the damages on the structures and the building process, several bottomless <b>arch</b> <b>culverts</b> has been studied. Information has been collected from articles and reports to study how water streams affects the construction and how to prevent damages. The Swedish Transport administrations set of regulations for how to build in water has been studied, and adapted to the bottomless <b>arch</b> <b>culvert.</b> The most severe problems for the bottomless <b>arch</b> <b>culvert</b> is deficient foundation, poor or non-existing riprap protection and maybe the most important; {{the absence of an}} actual design process when the span is less than two meters. The objective has been to compile explicit guidelines for how to design and later on construct a bottomless <b>arch</b> <b>culvert.</b> Set of regulation has been drawn up for riprap protection, protection towards frozen ground and the dimensions of the culvert. Drafts has been made for cross-sections and a outline of how to carry out the construction.

40|$|A multiarch culvert {{embankment}} is a {{new type}} of filling structure for which several precast <b>arch</b> <b>culverts</b> are installed continuously {{in the direction of the}} road extension. The key points in the design are to estimate the practical, optimal spacing between installed <b>arch</b> <b>culverts</b> and to clarify the interactive seismic behavior of the filling material and the culvert structure. In the current study, first, dynamic centrifuge model tests and a numerical analysis were carried out to clarify the basal earthquake behavior of the structure and verify the numerical approach. Then, the full-scale numerical analysis was performed to investigate the influence of spacing between multiarch culverts and the mechanical behavior under seismic conditions. From the results, it is confirmed that when the unit spacing is narrow, the whole rigidity of the ground and the <b>arch</b> <b>culvert</b> increases relatively. This is because the volume in the fill part, where the rigidity is small, decreases comparatively. Hence, the section force and the deformation are controlled...|$|R

40|$|Traditional culvert designs, in many cases, {{have become}} habitat {{barriers}} to aquatic animal species. In response, environmentally sensitive culvert designs {{have been developed}} to function as ecological bridges. Bottomless and buried invert culverts are examples of such designs and are commonly used for fish passage. Additional design guidance specific to streambed stability in buried-invert or bottomless culverts under high flow events is needed. This study investigated incipient motion conditions for four substrate materials in a 2 -ft (0. 61 -m) diameter circular bottomless <b>arch</b> <b>culvert</b> and in a 1 -ft (0. 30 -m) wide rectangular flume in a laboratory setting. General scour of the streambed within the bottomless <b>arch</b> <b>culvert</b> was also investigated under partially pressurized and non-pressurized flow conditions.

40|$|Fish passage {{designs for}} {{culverts}} rely mainly upon {{the comparison between}} the average flow velocity and the sustained swim speeds of fish, a method developed by studying salmonid species and their swimming patterns. This method does not recognize the role of reduced velocities near boundaries. Laboratory and field tests have been performed to test {{the use of these}} reduced velocities by several native Utah fish: leatherside chub (Lepidomeda aliciae), longnose dace (Rhinichthys cataractae), and speckled dace (Rhinichthys osculus). Laboratory flume tests were conducted using leatherside chub and longnose dace with three boundary conditions: a smooth boundary, a smooth boundary with strategically placed and sized cylinders, and a boundary consisting of natural substrate collected from the field. The key finding from these tests was that substrate that scaled with the fish length required the least energy expenditure, provided sufficient refuge to allow the fish to behave naturally, and allowed for successful passage. Field tests were performed in a southern Utah stream (Salina Creek) with speckled dace and leatherside chub. Fish were captured, marked, and recaptured at three locations: an <b>arch</b> <b>culvert</b> with a coarse substrate bottom, a double barrel concrete box culvert, and a stream section between the two culverts. Results showed that passage alone was not an adequate indicator of ability since not all fish attempt to pass upstream. Instead, population estimates within each of the sites were calculated to estimate use and the quality of habitat within the culverts. Population estimates were slightly higher at the <b>arch</b> <b>culvert</b> site than at the box culvert site. Velocity measurements were also taken near the boundary at each site to characterize the amount of variation within the culvert and population estimates correlated to the amount of variation found at each site. Providing fish with velocity variation by placing substrate instead of simply matching the average flow velocity to their swim speed may allow more fish to pass upstream and use the culvert as habitat rather than treating it as a barrier...|$|R

40|$|Ireland is {{currently}} undergoing the largest extension to the National road network in recent years. For this reason, {{the number of}} crossing structures for wildlife on the Irish National road network has increased markedly within the last few years. In Ireland, the structures are targeted at protected species whose habitat is directly disturbed by road construction. In general, the target species are otters (Lutra lutra) and badgers (Meles meles). However, structures {{have been put in}} place for red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris); i. e., rope ladders linking trees on opposite sides of a motorway and the first structures for pine martens (Martes martes) and bats will be put in place in the coming year. Bat boxes and bird boxes have also been fitted on the tunnel ceilings of oversized <b>arched</b> <b>culverts</b> with mammal ledges. Underpasses and overpasses (potential green bridges) have been constructed where farms have been bisected by new road schemes. These structures allow for the safe passage of domestic cattle over the road carriageway, but may also be utilized by wildlife, for example, red deer (Cervus elaphus) and other smaller wildlife species. Non-target native species which can utilise these structures are: red deer (Cervus elaphus), the indigenous Irish hare (Lepus timidus hibernicus), stoat (Mustela erminea hibernica), fox (Vulpes vulpes), pygmy shrew (Sorex minutus) and field or wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus). Non-native species which could potentially utilize such structures include: Sika deer (Cervus nippon), fallow deer (Cervus dama), brown hare (Lepus europaeus), rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), house mouse (Mus (musculus) domesticus), bank vole (Clethrionomys Glareolus), feral ferret (Mustela furo), American mink (Mustela vison), and domestic cats and dogs, amongst other introduced species. This is the first study to examine the effectiveness of crossing structures in Ireland. An initial pilot study monitoring the use of crossing structures on the Watergrasshill By-Pass, County Cork, Ireland, revealed encouraging results as the following species were found to utilize oversized <b>arched</b> <b>culverts</b> with mammal ledges: otter, fox, rabbit, pygmy shrew and wood mouse. Tracking tools utilized include: ink pads, sand beds, and infrared cameras. The initial pilot study was expanded to monitor crossing structures on a national scale in order to examine: (A) how effective are the culverts at providing passage for the target species? and (B) to what extent are cow under- and overpasses being utilised by wildlife? More specifically, the study is also currently examining: (1) with what frequency are the various passages being utilized?; (2) what non-target species utilize these passages?; (3) does the design of the fauna pipe (dimensions) affect utilization of the passage? e. g., are shorter pipes or longer pipes or small diameter (600 mm) or large diameter pipes (900 mm) more frequently used?; (4) does the presence of hedgerow planting enhance use of passage structures? (5) what kind of pipes do smaller species have a preference for? It is intended that {{the results of the study}} will provide valuable information which could improve the layout, design, and maintenance of future crossing structures to be put in place on national road schemes in Ireland, and indeed, in other countries...|$|R
