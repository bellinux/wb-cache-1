5|$|All <b>anticoagulants</b> are {{generally}} contraindicated {{in situations where}} the reduction in clotting that they cause might lead to serious and potentially life-threatening bleeds. This includes people with active bleeding conditions (such as gastrointestinal ulcers), or disease states with increased risk of bleeding e.g. low platelets, severe liver disease, uncontrolled hypertension. For patients undergoing surgery, treatment with <b>anticoagulants</b> is generally suspended. Similarly, spinal or lumbar puncture (e.g. spinal injections, epidurals, etc.) carry increased risk so treatment is suspended prior to these procedures.|$|E
5|$|The British {{gynecologist}} Stansfield {{is credited}} with the introduction, in 1942, of the just recently introduced anticoagulant heparin {{in the treatment of}} CVST in 1942.

5|$|Various {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the use of anticoagulation to suppress blood clot formation in cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Before these trials had been conducted, {{there had been a}} concern that small areas of hemorrhage in the brain would bleed further as a result of treatment; the studies showed that this concern was unfounded. Clinical practice guidelines now recommend heparin or low molecular weight heparin in the initial treatment, followed by warfarin, provided there are no other bleeding risks that would make these treatments unsuitable. Some experts discourage the use of anticoagulation if there is extensive hemorrhage; in that case, they recommend repeating the imaging after 7–10days. If the hemorrhage has decreased in size, <b>anticoagulants</b> are started, while no <b>anticoagulants</b> are given if there is no reduction.|$|E
40|$|A {{patient with}} a {{circulating}} lupus <b>anticoagulant</b> {{in the absence of}} systemic lupus erythematosus developed recurrent deep venous thromboses and pulmonary emboli. Pulmonary emboli recurred despite prolonged oral <b>anticoagulant</b> therapy and resulted in fatal pulmonary arterial hypertension.

40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{the mechanism of}} vascular thrombosis in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and the lupus <b>anticoagulant</b> changes in factors associated with haemostasis were investigated. The lupus <b>anticoagulant</b> was {{associated with an increased}} incidence of thrombosis, particularly cerebral thrombosis. Concentrations of fibrinopeptide A and fibrinopeptide B beta 15 - 42 were significantly raised in the plasma of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and the <b>anticoagulant</b> compared with concentrations in patients without the lupus <b>anticoagulant.</b> The tendency towards formation of thrombosis was not found in all lupus patients with the <b>anticoagulant,</b> however. Concentrations of thromboxane B 2 were remarkably raised in the plasma of the two patients with the lupus <b>anticoagulant</b> who had recently had thrombosis. Concentrations of 6 -keto-prostaglandin F 1 alpha, protein C, antithrombin III, and plasminogen were similar in both groups. No significant decrease in serum stimulatory activity on prostacyclin production by cultured aortic endothelial cells was noted in lupus patients with the <b>anticoagulant,</b> but inhibition was present in the two patients with recent thrombosis. These results indicate that although patients with the lupus <b>anticoagulant</b> are not always in a hypercoagulable state, haemostatic abnormalities found in some patients with the <b>anticoagulant</b> may be predictive of thrombotic events...|$|R
30|$|All {{statistical}} {{tests were}} performed using SPSS 20 (IBM). The samples collected in plain tubes (without any <b>anticoagulant)</b> were considered as control {{group and the}} concentrations observed in <b>anticoagulant</b> tubes were normalized against this value. We define ‘plain normalization’ as ratio of concentration of the drugs {{in each of the}} <b>anticoagulant</b> tubes with corresponding concentrations in plain tubes of the same animal. This normalization was carried out in order to eliminate interanimal variability in pharmacokinetics, thus making it possible to attribute differences in plain normalized values between <b>anticoagulant</b> groups to the <b>anticoagulant</b> effect. ANOVA, with Tukey’s post hoc test was used to compare the plain normalized values between the <b>anticoagulant</b> groups. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.|$|R
5|$|For many {{diseases}} of the heart, including atrial fibrillation and valvular disease, and after a heart operation, anticoagulation {{in the form of}} aspirin, warfarin, clopidogrel or novel oral <b>anticoagulants</b> is often given simultaneously, because of an increased risk of stroke or, {{in the context of a}} clotted heart vessel, rethrombosis.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{pharmacological}} therapies for DVT {{were introduced in}} the 20th century: oral <b>anticoagulants</b> in the 1940s, subcutaneous LDUH in 1962 and subcutaneous LMWH in 1982.

5|$|Prevention {{options for}} at-risk {{individuals}} include early and frequent walking, calf exercises, <b>anticoagulants,</b> aspirin, graduated compression stockings, and intermittent pneumatic compression.

Wearing graduated compression stockings appears {{to reduce the risk}} of post-thrombotic syndrome. The rate of DVTs increases from childhood to old age; in adulthood, about one in 1000 adults is affected per year.|$|E
40|$|Our {{purpose was}} to assess the {{presence}} of lupus <b>anticoagulant</b> and fibrinolytic system abnormalities in young patients with stroke. METHODS: We studied 33 consecutive ischemic patients aged < 50 years. Lupus <b>anticoagulant</b> was screened by four different coagulation tests, and the fibrinolytic system was studied by analyzing tissue plasminogen activator antigen and plasminogen activator inhibitor activity. RESULTS: Six patients (18 %), two of whom were affected by systemic lupus erythematosus, had lupus <b>anticoagulant.</b> Plasminogen activator inhibitor activity was significantly higher in those positive for lupus <b>anticoagulant</b> than in those negative for lupus <b>anticoagulant</b> and control subjects (p < 0. 001).

40|$|To {{reduce the}} side effects during {{hemodialysis}} treatment, we used FUT- 175 (FUT), which has anticomplementary activity as an <b>anticoagulant</b> during hemodialysis. On 9 dialysis patients and 8 domestic rabbits, we used heparin or FUT as an <b>anticoagulant</b> during dialysis and studied their effects on <b>anticoagulant</b> action, white blood cell count, complement activity and lipid metabolism. FUT exerted a stronger local <b>anticoagulant</b> action than heparin. Although FUT did not suppress hemodialysis leukopenia, it suppressed complement activity. FUT suppressed the decrease in triglyceride {{and the increase in}} free fatty acids observed during heparin administration. In conclusion, FUT could be an <b>anticoagulant</b> superior to heparin...|$|R
40|$|Back Ground : The correct {{amount of}} <b>anticoagulant</b> {{influenced}} the laboratory examination.

Objectives : The purpose {{of this research was}} to know the difference of total and morphology neutrophils between <b>anticoagulant</b> Conventional EDTA and Vacutainer EDTA. Method : This study was observasional with cross sectional design. 37 sample which fulfilled the inclusives criterias : the blood uncoagulated, 3 ml blood on conventional EDTA tube, the blood flow till 3 ml on Vacutainer EDTA tube, and the blood stand for not more 2 hours. Then counts the total neutrophils by manual differential leucocyte count and the percentage of neutrophils which has been changed. Data were processed with SPSS 13. 00 for Windows. The analysis was made with Paired T-Test and Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test. Result : The mean of total neutrophils with <b>anticoagulant</b> Conventional EDTA was 68. 68 ± 10. 40, Vacutainer EDTA 66. 78 ± 9. 135. The mean percentage of morphology neutrophils with <b>anticoagulant</b> Conventional EDTA was 96. 76 ± 6. 233, Vacutainer EDTA was 13. 14 ± 8. 832. By using Paired T-Test showed that there was not significant difference for total neutrophils between <b>anticoagulant</b> Conventional EDTA and Vacutainer EDTA with p values 0. 162.

5|$|The bat’s saliva, {{left in the}} victim's {{resulting}} bite wound, has a key {{function in}} feeding from the wound.

40|$|Lupus <b>anticoagulant,</b> {{concentrations}} of anticardiolipin antibodies, antithrombin III, plasminogen, (free) protein S, protein C, prothrombin, platelet counts, and bleeding times were determined in 74 lupus patients (58 with systemic lupus erythematosus; 16 with lupus-like disease) {{to establish the}} presence of risk factors for thrombosis in these patients. Of the variables evaluated, lupus <b>anticoagulant</b> had the strongest association {{with a history of}} thrombosis. Both positive anticardiolipin antibody concentrations and the presence of (mild) thrombocytopenia were significantly associated with a history of thrombosis and the presence of lupus <b>anticoagulant.</b> Reduced {{concentrations of}} antithrombin III, plasminogen, (free) protein S, and protein C were found in some patients but were not associated with either thrombosis or lupus <b>anticoagulant.</b> Mean concentrations of total protein S were significantly lower in patients with thrombosis than in those without and in patients with lupus <b>anticoagulant</b> than in those without. The antigenic concentration of prothrombin was reduced in 3 / 74 (4 %) lupus patients. These three patients had lupus <b>anticoagulant</b> but no history of thrombosis, which suggests that a low prothrombin concentration protects patients with lupus <b>anticoagulant</b> from the development of thrombosis. A prolonged bleeding time was associated with the presence of lupus <b>anticoagulant</b> but not with a history of thrombosis. Analysis by stepwise logistic regression did not disclose additional risk factors for thrombosis in lupus patients with lupus <b>anticoagulant.</b> Increased antithrombin III concentrations and decreased free protein S concentrations are often found in lupus patients, unrelated to lupus <b>anticoagulant</b> or thrombosis...|$|R
40|$|Rodents {{have been}} {{noteworthy}} pests in agricultural areas for decades. Because rodents impact diverse ecosystems, <b>anticoagulant</b> rodenticides have been heavily {{used throughout the}} world to control rodent populations. This continued use {{has led to the}} development of resistance to <b>anticoagulant</b> rodenticides in some populations of targeted rodents. Although many studies have investigated the genetic and molecular basis of <b>anticoagulant</b> resistance, few have focused on potential changes in metabolic function of resistant animals. In this study, vole (Microtus californicus, Peale) liver microsome preparations were made from unexposed animals living in areas that had never used <b>anticoagulant</b> rodenticides for either crop protection or for the control of commensal rodents and exposed voles living in artichoke fields that have used <b>anticoagulant</b> rodenticides since the mid- 1990 s. Using these microsome preparations, the metabolism of diphacinone and chlorophacinone was tested. Microsomes from both male and female voles from exposed areas metabolized significantly more <b>anticoagulant</b> than unexposed animals. Also, both exposed and unexposed animals metabolized more diphacinone than chlorophacinone. These findings suggest that alterations in metabolic function may play a role in <b>anticoagulant</b> resistance...|$|R
40|$|The <b>anticoagulant</b> {{activity}} of heparin dissolved in intravenous solutions {{was measured by}} two different methods of heparin assay.

When measured by the thrombin time, however, the heparin <b>anticoagulant</b> activity reamained reduced. The source of heparin, from either the lung or intestine, does not explain the reduction in <b>anticoagulant</b> activity.

5|$|X-ray crystallographic {{studies of}} {{warfarin}} {{show that it}} exists in tautomeric form, as the cyclic hemiketal, which is formed from the 4-hydroxycoumarin and the ketone in the 3-position substituent. However, the existence of many 4-hydroxycoumadin <b>anticoagulants</b> (for example phenprocoumon) that possess no ketone group in the 3-substituent to form such a structure, suggests that the hemiketal must tautomerise to the 4-hydroxy form in order for warfarin to be active.|$|E
5|$|After initial {{reports that}} {{warfarin}} could reduce bone mineral density, {{several studies have}} demonstrated a link between warfarin use and osteoporosis-related fracture. A 1999 study in 572 women taking warfarin for deep venous thrombosis, risk of vertebral fracture and rib fracture was increased; other fracture types did not occur more commonly. A 2002 study looking at a randomly selected selection of 1523 patients with osteoporotic fracture found no increased exposure to <b>anticoagulants</b> compared to controls, and neither did stratification of the duration of anticoagulation reveal a trend towards fracture.|$|E

40|$|Protein C is {{a natural}} vitamin K-dependent plasma <b>anticoagulant,</b> {{deficiencies}} {{of which have been}} found in patients with recurrent thrombosis and warfarin-induced skin necrosis. To appreciate more fully the role of protein C in disease states and during oral anticoagulation, a new functional assay for protein C involving adsorption of plasma protein C on a Ca+ 2 -dependent monoclonal antibody, elution, quantitative activation, and assessment of plasma <b>anticoagulant</b> activity, has been developed. When oral anticoagulation is initiated, the <b>anticoagulant</b> activity of protein C decreases {{to a greater extent than}} either the amidolytic or immunologic levels. During stabilized warfarin treatment, there is no correlation between either amidolytic or antigenic levels and the functional protein C activity, suggesting that measurement of protein C <b>anticoagulant</b> activity may be necessary to reflect adequately the <b>anticoagulant</b> protection afforded by this protein. In contrast, there was a strong correlation between <b>anticoagulant</b> and amidolytic and immunologic levels in liver failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Two patients with thromboembolic disease have been identified who exhibit a marked decrease in <b>anticoagulant</b> activity, but who have normal immunologic and amidolytic levels. Thus, this assay permits assessment of protein C in individuals who have received <b>anticoagulant</b> treatment and identification of a new class of protein C-deficient individuals...|$|R

40|$|Characterisation of <b>anticoagulant</b> {{control is}} {{fundamental}} to investigations of its association with clinical outcome. <b>Anticoagulant</b> control depends on several factors. This paper aims to illustrate the implications of different methods for measuring and analysing <b>anticoagulant</b> control in patients with second generation mechanical heart valve prostheses. International normalised ratio (INR) data collected during the 10 -year follow-up of a randomised controlled trial were analysed. We considered the influence of: 3 different target INR ranges; <b>anticoagulant</b> control expressed as the proportion of INR readings (PoR) vs. <b>anticoagulant</b> control follow-up time (PoT); 3 ways of describing the profile of <b>anticoagulant</b> control over time. Different target INR ranges dramatically influenced derived measures of <b>anticoagulant</b> control; the PoT within the target range varied from 88 % for the widest to 28 % for narrowest range. Overall distributions of PoR and PoT observations were similar but differed by up to ± 20 % for individuals; PoT exceeded PoR when control was good but was less than PoR when control was poor. Classifying PoT outside the target range showed that widely varying combinations of PoT too high and too low are possible across individuals. Researchers' choices about methods for measuring and quantifying <b>anticoagulant</b> control markedly influence the values derived from INR readings. The use of different methods across studies makes it difficult or impossible to compare findings and to establish an evidence base for clinical practice. Methods for quantifying <b>anticoagulant</b> control should be standardised...|$|R
5|$|Venous thrombosis, the {{formation}} of a blood clot in a vein, is a common cause of death in breast cancer patients; patients with recurrent disease are typically maintained on <b>anticoagulants</b> for their lifetimes.

One insect, the honey bee, provides honey, pollen, royal jelly, propolis and an anti-inflammatory peptide, melittin; its larvae too are eaten in some societies. Medical uses of insects include maggot therapy for wound debridement.

5|$|A {{number of}} risk scores exist to predict {{bleeding}} in people using warfarin and similar <b>anticoagulants.</b> A commonly used score (HAS-BLED) includes known predictors of warfarin-related bleeding: uncontrolled {{high blood pressure}} (H), abnormal kidney function (A), previous stroke (S), known previous bleeding condition (B), previous labile INR when on anticoagulation (L), elderly as defined by age over 65 (E), and drugs associated with bleeding (e.g. aspirin) or alcohol misuse (D). While their use is recommended in clinical practice guidelines, they are only moderately effective in predicting bleeding risk and do not perform well in predicting hemorrhagic stroke. Bleeding risk may be increased in people on hemodialysis. Another score used to assess bleeding risk on anticoagulation, specifically Warfarin or Coumadin, is the ATRIA score, which uses a weighted additive scale of clinical findings to determine bleeding risk stratification. The risks of bleeding are increased further when warfarin is combined with antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel, aspirin, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.|$|E

40|$|The use of potent anticogulant {{rodenticide}} ‘resistance-breakers’ is avoided due {{to their}} higher toxicity and potential to be more hazardous in the environment [6]. However, in areas where practitioners seek to control resistant rodent infestations, their use may pose less of a risk than applications of ineffective baits. Compounds to which rodents are resistant to, do not provide effective control and create a long-term source of AR in the environment. The higher quantities of <b>anticoagulant</b> rodenticide used show that using ineffective compounds may extend both the period and severity of exposure to non-target animals to <b>anticoagulant</b> rodenticides. Conversely the effective use of resistance-breakers to control <b>anticoagulant</b> rodenticide-resistant rat populations results in lower environmental exposure of <b>anticoagulant</b> rodenticides for non-targets. Of course, the relative toxicity of the different <b>anticoagulant</b> rodenticides will also play {{an important part in}} overall risk assessments.

5|$|From {{analysis}} of the existing small treatment trials of cervical artery dissection (carotid and vertebral) it appears that aspirin and anticoagulation (heparin followed by warfarin) are equally effective in {{reducing the risk of}} further stroke or death. Anticoagulation is regarded as more powerful than antiplatelet therapy, but <b>anticoagulants</b> may increase the size of the hematoma and worsen obstruction of the affected artery. Anticoagulation may be relatively unsafe if a large stroke has already occurred, as hemorrhagic transformation is relatively common, and if the dissection extends into V4 (carrying a risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage). Anticoagulation may be appropriate if there is rapid blood flow (through a severely narrowed vessel) on transcranial doppler despite the use of aspirin, if there is a completely occluded vessel, if there are recurrent stroke-like episodes, or if free-floating blood clot is visible on scans. Warfarin is typically continued for 3–6 months, as during this time the flow through the artery usually improves, and most strokes happen within the first 6 months after the development of the dissection. Some regard 3 months as sufficient.|$|E

40|$|Acute renal failure, {{a serious}} {{condition}} characterised by a drastic decline in renal function, often follows ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) episodes. I/R is characterised by necrosis, inflammation and activation of coagulation, in concert causing renal tissue damage. In this context, activated protein C (APC) {{might be of}} importance in the pathogenesis of renal I/R. APC is a serine protease which has <b>anticoagulant</b> but also several anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects such as protection of endothelial barrier function. It was our objective to study the role of cytoprotective and <b>anticoagulant</b> functions of APC during renal I/R. C 57 BL/ 6 j mice subjected to renal I/R were treated with intraperitoneally injected exogenous human APC, or two mutant forms of APC (200 mu g/kg) which specifically lack <b>anticoagulant</b> or signalling properties. In a different experiment mice received specific monoclonal antibodies (20 mg/kg) that block the cytoprotective and/or <b>anticoagulant</b> properties of endogenous APC. Treatment with APC reduced tubular injury and enhanced renal function without altering the inflammatory response and did reduce renal fibrin deposition. Administration of APC mutant lacking <b>anticoagulant</b> properties reduced renal damage and enhanced renal function. Blocking the <b>anticoagulant</b> and cytoprotective functions of endogenous APC resulted in elevated tubular damage and reduced tubular cell proliferation, however, without influencing renal function or the inflammatory response. Furthermore, blocking both the <b>anticoagulant</b> and cytoprotective effects of APC resulted in dramatic renal interstitial haemorrhage, indicative of impaired vascular integrity. Blocking only the <b>anticoagulant</b> function of APC {{did not result in}} interstitial bleeding. In conclusion, the renoprotective effect of APC during I/R is independent of its <b>anticoagulant</b> propertie...|$|R
