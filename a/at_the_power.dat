5|$|Homer becomes {{depressed}} {{after learning}} {{he has lived}} past the halfway point of the average life expectancy for men without accomplishing anything worthwhile. His family tries to cheer him up by showing him a film of his accomplishments and a special appearance by the character KITT from the Knight Rider television series that Homer is a fan of. When the film projector stops working, Lisa mentions that Thomas Edison invented the projector and many other inventions. Homer decides {{to learn more about}} Edison and eventually idolizes him. In an attempt to follow his footsteps, he quits his job <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> plant to become an inventor.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, NESCo set up {{separate}} plant <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> {{station for}} the low temperature carbonisation treatment of coal, before being burned in boilers and the steam used for electricity generation. The treatment plant was manufactured by Babcock & Wilcox, and {{set up in a}} self-contained boiler house which contained four boilers, four retorts and pulverising mills. The building was also fitted with gas-stripping and by-product plants. The carbonising plant could handle up to 100 tonnes of coal per day, while its boilers produced 78,000lb of steam per hour. This plant was extended in 1931.|$|E

However, due to the strong resistance from local community in the island, the nuclear waste has to be stored <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> plant facilities themselves.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns asks Homer to {{help him}} with a speech for a crisis {{shareholders}} meeting. Homer gives Smithers his last joint, and while Smithers is smoking it, Burns apparently drowns in his bathtub.

The meeting is a success, and another financial crisis <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> plant is avoided.|$|E
5|$|On 9 November 2008, Chelsea Football Club were {{reported}} to be considered moving to a new purpose built stadium <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> station. The proposed stadium was to hold between 65,000 and 75,000 fans and feature a retractable roof. The proposals were designed by HOK Sport, the same company who designed Wembley Stadium. However, the Chelsea FC scheme was seriously in doubt due to concerns {{for the preservation of}} the site and the collapse of the REO scheme in late November 2011.|$|E

5|$|While {{browsing}} {{through the}} family photo album, Lisa notices {{that there are}} no baby pictures of Maggie. Homer explains by recounting the story of Maggie's birth.

5|$|Despite Shinwell's actions {{the fuel}} supply {{remained}} insufficient and blackouts occurred across large swathes of the country, forcing even {{the staff at}} Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament and London's Central Electricity Board to work by candlelight. A trade meeting with representatives from Russia and Iceland was also held without light or heating; one of the items discussed was the purchase of coal from Britain. The public was reduced to queuing at gasworks to collect coke for use as fuel. Supplies of aspirin also ran low {{as it was then}} a product of coal-tar, thousands of chickens in poultry farms died of the cold, and public transport services were cut to save fuel. Shinwell became increasingly unpopular with the general public and received a bomb threat, after which a four-man police guard was stationed at his house in Tooting. Despite this, he remained very popular with the miners, which made the government wary of dismissing him in case it caused industrial action. By 27February sea conditions had improved and more than 100 coal ships had managed to unload their cargoes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> stations, easing the fuel crisis.|$|E
5|$|Homer applies {{for a job}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> plant once more, {{this time}} marching into Mr. Burns's office and telling him {{that he will be}} the perfect employee. Mr. Burns is so {{impressed}} that he hires Homer on the spot. When Homer returns to Marge's house, he discovers from Jacqueline that she has gone into labor and is already at the hospital. He quickly gets there and sees Marge with Selma and an angry Patty, who starts berating him. Fed up with her disrespect, Homer lashes out at Patty and angrily tells Patty (as well {{as the rest of the}} Bouvier family) to start showing him some respect for he has a job, a piece of news that Homer promptly tells Marge before she finally gives birth to Bart. After Homer finishes telling his flashback story, he admits to Bart that he received the greatest gift a man can have the day Bart was born. At that time, Marge arrives home with the news that she is not pregnant. They are both overjoyed and high-five.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Stella North was at {{the centre}} of a legal case in which three men were found guilty of {{conspiracy}} to defraud after {{trying to sell the}} CEGB poor quality coal when contracted to deliver high quality coal. The three men involved were D.C.P. Brooksbank, a salesman for a coal firm; J.W. Patterson, a sampler <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> station, and M. Ridley, a contractor. Their scheme was for Patterson to substitute samples of reasonably good coal for the samples of poor coal taken from the lorries. However they were found out only two days after starting the scheme, when a foreman at the station saw Patterson dropping a bag of cement into the sampling bin, and reported the incident. Ridley was found to have planned the fraud, and was jailed for a year, while Brooksbank was fined £150 and Patterson £75.|$|E

Locomotives 113 001-2 and 113 003-8 were similarly modified. The remaining locomotive (113 004-6) {{has not been}} modified.|$|R

5|$|Local trade unions, Durham County Council, {{and even}} the Farmers' Union were {{in support of the}} scheme, along with a number of private persons, the general reason being that it would bring a new form of {{employment}} to the city and surrounding areas. Opponents to the station however claimed that the new jobs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> station would go to specialist technicians brought into the region, and that the positioning of the station near Durham would not be beneficial to the city's electricity supply or make the cost of electricity any cheaper for those living near the station. Critics also claimed that wherever in the region a new power station were to be built, County Durham coal would be used in it, and that despite NESCo's claims, there may be more suitable sites elsewhere. The critics claimed that Durham's functioning as a cultural, educational, administrative and tourist centre, would be ultimately destroyed by heavy industrialisation.|$|E
5|$|The NS-10 {{displaced}} the Auratone 5C Sound Cube as the nearfield monitor {{of choice}} in the 1980s and was recognised {{for its ability to}} reveal shortcomings in recordings. It probably first reached American shores through a recording engineer's visit to Japan. The engineer, likely to have been Greg Ladanyi, monitored a recording session through the speaker in a Japanese studio and brought a pair back on his return to the US. Ladanyi then began using the speakers in a Los Angeles studio. Other engineers heard the NS-10 {{for the first time and}} were impressed by its sound. Its use spread to New York where the NS-10 was adopted <b>at</b> <b>The</b> <b>Power</b> Station and other studios.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons uses a {{floating}} timeline {{in which the}} characters do not physically age, and as such the show {{is assumed to be}} set in the current year. In several episodes, events have been linked to specific times, though sometimes this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. Maggie is the youngest child of Marge and Homer, and sister to Bart and Lisa. When Marge became pregnant with Bart, she and Homer got married at a chapel in Las Vegas. To support his impending family, Homer all but demanded a job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, impressing its owner, Mr. Burns, with his aggressive submissiveness. When Marge became pregnant with Lisa, two years later, she and Homer bought their first house. Another six years later, Homer felt financially secure enough to finally quit his job <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Power</b> Plant and take his dream job at Barney's Bowlarama. However, Marge became pregnant with Maggie, so Homer, once again unable to support his family, was forced to reapply for his old job. By the time Maggie was born, Homer had shown great signs of distress, but he managed to find motivation in the form of his newborn baby girl.|$|E
