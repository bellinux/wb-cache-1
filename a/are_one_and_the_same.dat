5|$|Imelda's Blue Ladies—specifically Maria Luisa, a {{daughter}} of the rich Madrigal family and the wife of Dr. Vasquez—contributed to the fashion spending of Imelda. In 1968, Maria Luisa accompanied Imelda on an overseas trip, during which Imelda and daughter Imee spent $3.3 million. It was also {{at this time that}} Dr. Daniel Vasquez and Maria Luisa opened a Citibank account. On November of the same year, the couple added Fernanda Vazquez as a joint holder of the bank account. An allegation that Imelda and Fernanda Vasquez <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> is validated {{by the fact that the}} notations for the bank account had Imelda Marcos's handwriting.|$|E
5|$|Bruce {{invites the}} {{orphaned}} Dick {{to stay at}} Wayne Manor. Dick, still troubled by {{the murder of his}} family, intends to kill Two-Face and avenge his family. When he discovers that Bruce is Batman, he demands that Bruce help him find Two-Face so that he can kill him, but Bruce refuses. Meanwhile, Nygma turns himself into a criminal called the Riddler and forms an alliance with Two-Face. The two steal capital in order to mass-produce Nygma's brainwave device. At Nygma's business party, Nygma discovers Bruce's alter ego using the brainwave device. Two-Face arrives and crashes the party. He nearly kills Batman, but Dick manages to save him. Meanwhile, Chase has fallen in love with Bruce, which surpasses her obsession with Batman, but she soon discovers that they <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> Bruce decides to stop being Batman {{in order to have a}} normal life with Chase and to prevent Dick from murdering Two-Face. Dick angrily runs away while Bruce and Chase have dinner together in the manor. The Riddler and Two-Face arrive and attack Wayne Manor; in the process, the Riddler destroys the Batcave. The criminals kidnap Chase after Two-Face shoots Bruce and the Riddler leaves him an another riddle.|$|E
5|$|As per Tulsidas, the Nirguna Brahman (quality-less impersonal absolute) and Saguna Brahman (personal God with qualities) <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> Both, Saguna (qualified Brahman) and Aguna (or Nirguna - {{unqualified}} Brahman) are Akath (unspeakable), Agaadh (unfathomable), Anaadi (without beginning, {{in existence}} since eternity) and Anupa (without parallel) (अगुन सगुन दुइ ब्रह्म सरूपा। अकथ अगाध अनादि अनूपा॥). It is the devotion (Bhakti) of the devotee that forces the Nirguna Brahman which is quality-less, formless, invisible and unborn, to become Saguna Brahman with qualities. Tulsidas gives {{the example of}} water, snow and hail to explain this – the substance is the same in all three, but the same formless water solidifies to become hail or a mountain of snow – {{both of which have}} a form. Tulsidas also gives the simile of a lake – the Nirguna Brahman is like the lake with just water, while the Saguna Brahman is a lake resplendent with blooming lotuses. In the Uttar Kand of Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas describes in detail a debate between Kakbhushundi and Lomasa about whether God is Nirguna (as argued by Lomasa adhering to monism) or Saguna (as argued by Kakbhushundi adhering to dualism). Kakbhushundi repeatedly refutes all the arguments of Lomasa, to the point when Lomasa becomes angry and curses Kakbhushundi to be a crow. Lomasa repents later when Kakbhushundi happily accepts the curse but refuses to give up the Bhakti of Rama, the Saguna Brahman. Though Tulsidas holds both aspects of God to be equal, he favours the qualified Saguna aspect and the devotees of the highest category in the Ramcharitmanas repeatedly ask for the qualified Saguna aspect of Rama to dwell in their mind. Some authors contend from a few couplets in Ramcharitmanas and Vinay Patrika that Tulsidas has vigorously contradicted the denial of Avatar by Kabir. In several of his works, Kabir had said that the actual Rama is not the son of Dasharatha. In the Balkand of Ramcharitmanas, Shiva tells Parvati – those who say that the Rama whom the Vedas sing of and whom the sages contemplate on is different from the Rama of Raghu's race are possessed by the devil of delusion and do not know the difference between truth and falsehood. However, such allusions are based on interpretations of the text and do not hold much water when considered in the context of Ramcharitmanas. Tulsidas, in none of his works, has ever mentioned Kabir.|$|E

25|$|In {{discussing}} God's {{relationship to}} His creation, Orthodox theology distinguishes between God's eternal essence, which is totally transcendent, and His uncreated energies, {{which is how}} He reaches us. The God who is transcendent and the God who touches us <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> That is, these energies are not something that proceed from God or that God produces, but rather they are God himself: distinct, yet inseparable from, God's inner being.|$|E

25|$|Colpoys {{was one of}} four {{vessels that}} Mr. T. Lockyer, of Plymouth, owned that the {{government}} hired at the same time. In reporting the transaction, the Naval Chronicle described Colpoys as a schooner under the command of Lieutenant Usher (or Ussher), and the two chase guns as 6-pounders. Throughout Colpoyss military career, references to her in the London Gazette and Lloyd's List fluctuated between describing her as a brig, cutter, and schooner. There are no references in Admiralty records of other vessels by that name, and the names of her commander generally assure that all these vessels <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b>|$|E
25|$|In an {{adiabatic}} process, {{there is}} transfer of energy as work {{but not as}} heat. For all adiabatic process that takes a system from a given initial state to a given final state, irrespective of how the work is done, the respective eventual total quantities of energy transferred as work <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> determined just by the given initial and final states. The work done on the system is defined and measured by changes in mechanical or quasi-mechanical variables external to the system. Physically, adiabatic transfer of energy as work requires the existence of adiabatic enclosures.|$|E

25|$|Laksa lemak, {{also known}} as nyonya laksa (Malay: Laksa nyonya), {{is a type of}} laksa with a rich coconut gravy. Lemak is a culinary {{description}} in the Malay language which specifically refers to the presence of coconut milk which adds a distinctive richness to a dish. As the name implies, it is made with a rich, slightly sweet and strongly spiced coconut gravy. Laksa lemak is usually made with a fish-based gravy (with vegetarian food stalls omitting fish) and quite similar to Thai laksa (Malay: Laksa Thai), perhaps to the point that one could say they <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b>|$|E
25|$|Traditional Indian scriptures see Ṛta, a Hindu {{theological}} term {{similar to}} dharma, {{as a natural}} law that governs both the cosmos and human society. Performance of one's duties to uphold social institutions, such as marriage and family, thus becomes imperative, and duty overrides individual freedom. Dnyaneshwar is in agreement with tradition; he believes that divine order and moral order <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> and are inherent in the universe itself. He, therefore, recommends that all social institutions be protected and preserved in their totality. However, {{when it comes to}} the institution of caste, his approach becomes more humanitarian and he advocates spiritual egalitarianism.|$|E

25|$|The Inquisitor {{eventually}} encounters the Viddasala, the Qunari {{in charge}} of the operation, who claims that the Qunari instigated it in order to prevent an incident like the Breach's appearance - which they blamed on the south's failure to adequately control mages - from being repeated. She also accuses the Inquisitor of working with Fen'Harel, before escaping. After the Inquisitor foils the plot, they convince the Viddasala that they are not Fen Harel's agents, and the Viddasala in turn reveals that Solas is the agent of Fen'Harel who has been disrupting the Dragon's Breath plot, unaware that they <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> She pursues Solas into the Eluvian network, with the Inquisitor following, despite the Anchor growing increasingly out of control. Ultimately, the Viddasala is killed by Solas, who temporarily calms the Anchor so he can explain himself.|$|E
