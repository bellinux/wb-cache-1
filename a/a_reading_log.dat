Title I parents and students from three schools in a rural North Carolina school district participated in a parent development session that focused on reading strategies to use at home. Parents and Title I teachers were in contact during the summer via telephone or face-to-face and students kept <b>a</b> <b>reading</b> <b>log</b> in order to collect data regarding reading routines. Quantitative data were collected using a pretest/posttest method using the end-of-year second-grade oral reading fluency assessment using Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS Next). Quantitative data from reading logs and questionnaires were also used to analyze the impact of parent development and a home-based summer reading program on summer reading loss as measured by oral reading fluency (rate). Qualitative data were collected from questionnaires, parent contact logs, and reading logs. Quantitative and qualitative methods (QUAN-qual) were used to collect and analyze data in order to answer four research questions: (1) What is the impact of the parent development seminar on parents 2 ̆ 7 abilities to demonstrate mastery of reading strategies? (2) What is the impact of summer reading volume (number of books initially and repeatedly read) on summer reading loss as measured by the difference in May and August oral reading fluency scores? (3) : What is the impact of reading strategies (echo, NIM, shared, and repeated readings) on summer reading loss as measured by the difference in May and August oral reading fluency scores? (4) What is the impact of parent development and home-based summer reading on summer reading loss as measured by the difference in May and August oral reading fluency scores? The researcher found that parent development and home-based summer reading had a positive impact on struggling readers 2 ̆ 7 (red zone) and home literacy routines. This study also found that repeated readings (within the same day) and face-to-face communication were effective strategies to target summer reading loss. Recommendations for future research include a larger sample size and a focus on the type of parent communication students receive (face-to-face or telephone). Additional recommendations include revisions to the reading log to emphasize repeated readings and to improve self-reporting methods...|$|E

In the literature review, I defined listening (top-down and bottom-up processing). I defined reading and data processing related to it. I described reading while listening method through various definitions of several authors. I thoroughly presented the findings related to reading while listening method and accurately described {{the ones that were}} in direct relation to the chosen topic. At the end of the theoretical part, I summarized the research findings on the reading while listening method. The empirical part investigates the results of research on the students´ perceptions about their English language proficiency in using reading while listening method. The study involved 92 students of the Year 3 Primary Education students of the Faculty of Education University of Ljubljana. The students used the reading while listening method, and had to read while listen different kinds of reading materials as part of their home assignments and fill in the portfolio which served as <b>a</b> <b>reading</b> <b>log.</b> They were assessed orally and had to take a written examination. They also had to fill in a survey questionnaire about the method. The results show that the majority of students perceived that they had improved their reading fluency and listening comprehension by applying the reading while listening method. When tested in these two language subskills, the majority of them achieved good results (grades 8, 9 and 10). On the other hand, most of the students considered that they had improved their pronunciation and intonation but {{more than half of them}} achieved low results. In all components of the English language competence (reading fluency, listening comprehension, pronunciation and intonation), there was always more than half of the students that believed that they had improved at every single component. The students also believed that they had improved their English language proficiency for many different reasons. Some believed that had been due to the fact they had both listened and read reading materials simultaneously and therefore understood the text better, others believed that they listened and improved the pronunciation and enriched their vocabulary. 13 of them believed that it is possible to improve one`s language proficiency if the method is used regularly (every day). Only a handful of students believed that this method cannot improve English language proficiency as a whole but only its particular subskills...|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 23 - 27). The {{purpose of}} this study is to determine the effectiveness that parent involvement has on a child?s sight word development with the use of take-home literacy folders. The participants consisted of eight kindergarten students; four girls and four boys. The sample group was analyzed in comparison with the remaining 13 students in the class. All 21 students in the class received the same instruction during school hours. Classroom instruction consisted of large group lessons, guided reading groups, and literacy centers. All 21 students were given the same assessments throughout the year. Participants were given a literacy folder that contained a book at their instructional reading level which is based on the Fountas and Pinnell Reading Benchmark Assessment (Heinemann, 2012), a comprehension activity to go along with the book, a reading strategy bookmark, and a set of sight word flash cards. There was <b>a</b> <b>reading</b> <b>log</b> in which the parents recorded and commented on their experiences, as well as a guide for quality reading tips for parents. The children took their folders home every Monday and Wednesday and brought them back to school on Wednesday and Friday. The remaining students in the class did not receive the literacy folder. The only activity provided by me for them to take home and work on with families was a weekly sight word book. The participants also received these sight word books. I examined sight word gains in the eight candidates versus the other 13 which showed a significant growth in the participants versus the remaining children. The participants made an eleven percent gain in sight words learned from January to April. The others, while they continued to learn new words, decreased their percentage by five percent. This made for a sixteen percent difference between the children who received the literacy folders and the children who did not. The parents of the children who used the literacy folders were given one survey (see appendix 2) The attitude of the parents who did participate in the survey was overall very positive. They felt as though it was something that benefited their children and if given the choice would do it again. These results were shared with parents to increase the awareness of the importance of literacy sharing in the home environment. Overall I believe it is a beneficial addition to my kindergarten classroom...|$|E

The teachers of this school perceived that parents needed to give more support to children when it comes to reading.

The target population comprised of twenty nine pupils along with the parent/carer who reads with the child at home and also three teachers.
