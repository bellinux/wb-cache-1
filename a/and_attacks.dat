5|$|A mysterious {{recruiter}} approaches Wilson, {{offering an}} experimental cure for his cancer. He {{is taken to}} Ajax and Angel Dust, who inject him with a serum designed to awaken latent mutant genes. They then subject him to days of torture to induce stress to trigger any mutation Wade may have, but without success. Wilson discovers Ajax's real name, Francis, and mocks him for it. In response, Ajax leaves Wilson in a hyperbaric chamber that takes him to the verge of asphyxiation periodically over a weekend. It finally activates a superhuman healing ability that cures his cancer, but leaves him severely disfigured with burn-like scars over his entire body. He escapes from the chamber <b>and</b> <b>attacks</b> Ajax, but relents when told that his disfigurement can be cured. Ajax subdues Wilson and leaves him for dead in the burning laboratory.|$|E
5|$|A {{very small}} {{proportion}} (those affected by SMAD4 (MADH4) mutations, see below) have multiple benign polyps {{in the large}} intestine, which may bleed or transform into colorectal cancer. A similarly small proportion experiences pulmonary hypertension, a state in which the pressure in the lung arteries is increased, exerting pressure {{on the right side}} of the heart and causing peripheral edema (swelling of the legs), fainting <b>and</b> <b>attacks</b> of chest pain. It has been observed that the risk of thrombosis (particularly venous thrombosis, in the form of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) may be increased. There is a suspicion that those with HHT may have a mild immunodeficiency and are therefore at a slightly increased risk from infections.|$|E

5|$|Another {{squadron}} of Liberators {{was added to}} No.82 Wing's strength in late-April 1945. The bombers attacked targets in Java in the lead-up to Operation Oboe One, the invasion of Tarakan, which commenced on 1May.

No.76 Wing's Catalinas mined harbours {{as far north as}} Hong Kong and the Gulf of Hainan, China. By July, NWA had been denuded of much of its offensive capability as Nos.79 and 82 Wings had been transferred to the First Tactical Air Force in Morotai. No.85 Wing was formed the same month under NWA's control; it comprised two Liberator squadrons but only one became operational {{before the end of the}} Pacific War.|$|E

40|$|DOI: [URL]   The aim of {{the present}} study was to analyze the {{association}} between variables of the game on the offensive structure from the zone in which attack is performed in high-level Men’s volleyball. The sample was composed by 12 teams, with the analysis of 142 games, which totalized 19, 545 reception, set <b>and</b> <b>attack</b> actions. Data analyses were run with descriptive statistic and the qui-quadratic test for searching association between the variables. The results showed association between tempo of <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> <b>attack</b> effect, type of <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> <b>attack</b> zone <b>and</b> <b>attack</b> zone <b>and</b> tempo of <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> <b>attack</b> effect. It was concluded that Brazilian teams underuse backcourt <b>attacks,</b> <b>and</b> the offensive structure accomplished through the faster game, which is mainly important on attacks carried out in positions 2, 3 and 4. Furthermore, the reception quality proved to be the precursor factor in the construction of attack. It was also observed that there was no 1 st tempo of attacks from the backcourt, indicating that it is necessary to change the type of game, specifically with the increment of the speed of sets conducted by the backcourt...|$|R
