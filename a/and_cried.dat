5|$|That night, {{many of the}} revolutionaries {{attended}} a theatre production {{on the theme of}} tyranny, called Rome Saved. The lead actor was Morante, playing Cicero. The police chief requested Morante to feign illness and not appear, so that the play could be replaced with Misanthropy and Repentance by the German novelist and playwright August von Kotzebue. Rumors of police censorship spread quickly; Morante ignored the request and performed the play as planned. In the fourth act, Morante made a patriotic speech, about the Gaul threat to Rome (the Gauls are ancestors of the French people) and the need for strong leadership to resist the danger. This scene lifted the revolutionaries' spirits and led to frenzied applause. Juan José Paso stood up <b>and</b> <b>cried</b> out for the freedom of Buenos Aires, and a small fight ensued.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} match, competitors Shawn Michaels and Rick Martel were unable, {{due to a}} pre-match stipulation, to hit {{each other in the}} face. The two men exchanged holds but were both preoccupied with looking to ringside for approval from Sensational Sherri. Martel gained the advantage by throwing Michaels to the outside of the ring and attacking him there. When the two returned to the ring, they took turns attempting to pin their opponent, pulling down their opponent's wrestling tights to reveal their buttocks each time. Michaels then kicked Martel and tried to pin him, but the referee stopped the three-count because Michaels' feet were on the ropes. Both wrestlers broke the pre-match stipulation by slapping each other in the face. Sherri pretended to faint, which drew the attention of both wrestlers. Michaels and Martel argued over who would carry Sherri backstage, with each man carrying her a few feet before being stopped by his opponent. Both wrestlers were counted out, but they continued to argue. Martel tried to revive Sherri by throwing water on her, but he hit Michaels as well. Michaels dropped Sherri and chased Martel backstage; upset at being left behind by both men, Sherri screamed <b>and</b> <b>cried</b> as she walked backstage.|$|E
5|$|The thistle {{has been}} one of the {{national}} emblem of the Scots nation since the reign of Alexander III (1249–1286) and was used on silver coins issued by James III in 1470. Today, it forms part of the emblem of the Scottish Rugby Union. As legend has it, an invading army had attempted to sneak up at night on the Scots. One, perhaps barefooted, unwelcome foreign soldier stumbled upon a Scots Thistle, <b>and</b> <b>cried</b> out in pain, thus alerting Scots to their presence. Some sources suggest the specific occasion was the Battle of Largs, which marked the beginning of the departure of the Viking monarch Haakon IV of Norway, who had harried the coast for some years. Spiky plants such as brambles appear to have been used around forts since time immemorial, so the story, whether it factually relates to the Haakon episode or not, likely is the culmination of more than one such event over time. In some variants, it is invading English which stumble on a thistle, but the story predates this time.|$|E

40|$|Thirteen of {{the most}} common lepidopteran-specific Cry {{proteins}} of Bacillus thuringiensis have been tested for their efficacy against newly hatched larvae of two populations of the spiny bollworm, Earias insulana. At a concentration of 100 μg of toxin per milliliter of artificial diet, six Cry toxins (Cry 1 Ca, Cry 1 Ea, Cry 1 Fa, Cry 1 Ja, <b>Cry</b> 2 Aa, <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 2 Ab) were not toxic at all. Cry 1 Aa, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ja, <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 2 Aa did not cause mortality but caused significant inhibition of growth. The other Cry toxins (Cry 1 Ab, Cry 1 Ac, Cry 1 Ba, Cry 1 Da, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ia, <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca) were toxic to E. insulana larvae. The 50 % lethal concentration values of these toxins ranged from 0. 39 to 21. 13 μg/ml (for <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ia, respectively) for an E. insulana laboratory colony originating from Egypt and from 0. 20 to 4. 25 μg/ml (for <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Da, respectively) for a laboratory colony originating from Spain. The relative potencies of the toxins in the population from Egypt were highest for <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab, <b>and</b> they were both significantly more toxic than <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ba, followed by <b>Cry</b> 1 Da <b>and</b> finally <b>Cry</b> 1 Ia. In the population from Spain, Cry 9 Ca was the most toxic, followed in decreasing order by <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ba, <b>and</b> the least toxic was Cry 1 Da.

25|$|The most {{important}} proteins {{which make up}} the mammalian TTNFL are the Period (PER), <b>and</b> Cryptochrome (<b>CRY)</b> proteins, BMAL1, CLOCK, and casein kinase 1 epsilon. PER <b>and</b> <b>CRY</b> levels are regulated by negative feedback, meaning that they repress their own transcription. BMAL1 and CLOCK work to increase PER <b>and</b> <b>CRY</b> transcription by binding on the E-box domain upstream from the PER <b>and</b> <b>CRY</b> gene coding sequences. The level of PER <b>and</b> <b>CRY</b> proteins is regulated by casein kinase 1 through phosphorylation, which marks these proteins for degradation by the cell. Phosphorylation also hinders PER's ability to enter the nucleus by inducing a conformational change in its nuclear localization sequence. However, if CRY proteins bind to PER before this phosphorylation can occur, all three proteins stabilize into a complex that can enter the nucleus. Once inside the nucleus, PER <b>and</b> <b>CRY</b> can work to inhibit their own transcription, while casein kinase 1 epsilon works to modulate the activity of BMAL1 and CLOCK through phosphorylation.|$|R

50|$|A similar {{model is}} found in mice, in which BMAL1 dimerizes with CLOCK to {{activate}} per <b>and</b> cryptochrome (<b>cry)</b> transcription. PER <b>and</b> <b>CRY</b> proteins form a heterodimer which acts on the CLOCK-BMAL heterodimer to repress the transcription of per <b>and</b> <b>cry.</b> The heterodimer CLOCK:BMAL1 functions similarly to other transcriptional activator complexes; CLOCK:BMAL1 interacts with the E-box regulatory elements.

25|$|But {{perhaps my}} finest memory of this lordly Frenchman came in 1966 at the Nürburgring, where a German {{official}} had been particularly rude {{to myself and}} other English journalists about going through one gate (the exit) to the press room instead of another 100 yards away (the entrance). We sat in delight, Sid Saltmarsh, Bill Long and me, not 20 yards from that 'Exit' gate, and watched as Jacques pulled up in his Ford Mustang, and proceeded to unload his bike {{from the back of}} the car.

40|$|Insecticidal {{activity}} and receptor binding properties of Bacillus thuringiensis toxins to yellow and striped rice stem borers (Sciropophaga incertulas and Chilo suppresalis, respectively) were investigated. Yellow stem borer (YSB) was susceptible to Cry 1 Aa, Cry 1 Ac, <b>Cry</b> 2 A, <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 C toxins with similar toxicities. To striped stem borer (SSB), Cry 1 Ac, <b>Cry</b> 2 A, <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 C were more toxic than Cry 1 Aa toxin. Binding assays were performed with (sup 125) I-labeled toxins (Cry 1 Aa, Cry 1 Ac, <b>Cry</b> 2 A, <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 C) <b>and</b> brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) prepared from YSB and SSB midguts. Both <b>Cry</b> 1 Aa <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac toxins showed saturable, high-affinity binding to YSB BBMV. <b>Cry</b> 2 A <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 C toxins bound to YSB BBMV with relatively low binding affinity but with high binding site concentration. To SSB, both <b>Cry</b> 1 Aa <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac exhibited high binding affinity, although these toxins are less toxic than <b>Cry</b> 1 C <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 2 A. <b>Cry</b> 1 C <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 2 A toxins bound to SSB BBMV with relatively low binding affinity but with high binding site concentration.
