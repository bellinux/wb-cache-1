40|$|The {{compatibility}} {{of three}} nano-montmorillonite (nano-Mt) dispersions in hydrating cement binders was investigated {{and a new}} theory linking the nanostructure of nano-Mt dispersions to their effect on the macroscale performance of cement pastes is presented. Two aqueous organomodified nano-Mt dispersions (one dispersed with non-ionic fatty alcohol {{and the other with}} anionic <b>alkyl</b> <b>aryl</b> <b>sulphonate)</b> and one aqueous inorganic nano-Mt dispersion (dispersed with sodium tripolyphosphate) were characterized via TEM, XRD, SEM/EDX and TGA/DTG. With this characterization protocol, the way carbon loading and surfactants interact with the nanostructure of the nano-Mt dispersions in light of their addition in composite cements was clarified. The suggested methodology is suited for the characterization of nano-Mt and the entirely new theory developed will open up a new horizon for the understanding and exploitation of nano-Mt as a supplementary cementitious material...|$|E
40|$|Water {{is unique}} among liquids {{for its ability}} for {{tetrahedral}} coordination with four neighbouring molecules. Water catalyzed reactions (or spontaneous reactions) are pH independent hydrolytic processes that involve the transfer of one or several protons to or from water molecules in the transition state (TS) of the rate determining step. Indeed, in these reactions one water molecule acts as a nucleophile while one or several act as general bases, and typically show a) high negative values of entropy of activation (∆S ≠), and b) high kinetic solvent isotope effect (KSIE). In these reactions water is solvent, nucleophile and catalyst. The hydrolyses of alkyl halides, <b>alkyl</b> and <b>aryl</b> <b>sulphonates,</b> and derivatives of carboxylic acids (esters, amides) have been extensively studied. The reaction with derivatives of saturated carbons is quite different than the hydrolyses of esters and amides. At least two water molecules must be strongly bound at the TS to produce a high KSIE, restricting the number of possible positions of these molecules. The number of molecules involved in the proton transfer (two molecules per proton) can be determined by proton inventory. Polymolecular mechanisms have been found for these reactions with 3 - 5 molecules involved in the TS. Hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the substrate is determinant of the mechanism.
