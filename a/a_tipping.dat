30|$|A closed-form {{solution}} for a finite cantilevered sectorial plate subjected to <b>a</b> <b>tip</b> concentrated force is presented. Since the particular solution {{was not found}} in the literature, it is derived in this paper. A symmetric eigenfunction expansion is used to augment the particular solution to account for the fixed boundary conditions at the circumferential support. Deflections from the total closed-from solution are found to be in excellent agreement with deflection results from a finite element analysis; the error is always within 0.08  % for the given example. Finally, the total {{closed-form solution}}s for a cantilevered sectorial plate subjected to independent applications of <b>a</b> <b>tip</b> concentrated force, <b>a</b> <b>tip</b> bending moment, and <b>a</b> <b>tip</b> twisting moment, are compiled.|$|R

30|$|A closed-form {{solution}} is presented for a cantilevered sectorial plate subjected to <b>a</b> <b>tip</b> concentrated force. Since the particular solution for this {{problem was not}} found in the literature, it is derived here. Deflections from the total solution (particular plus homogeneous solutions) are compared to those from a finite element analysis and are found to be in excellent agreement, producing an error within approximately 0.08  %. Normalized closed-form deflections and slopes at the fixed support, resulting from an approximate enforcement of the boundary conditions there, deviate from zero by < 0.08  %. Finally, the total {{closed-form solution}}s for a cantilevered sectorial plate subjected to independent applications of <b>a</b> <b>tip</b> concentrated force, <b>a</b> <b>tip</b> bending moment, and <b>a</b> <b>tip</b> twisting moment, are compiled.|$|R

Yeltsin used the results of the referendum of April 1993 to justify his actions. In response, the parliament declared that the president's decision was null and void, impeached Yeltsin and proclaimed vice president Aleksandr Rutskoy to be acting president.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} glide waxes are {{tailored}} for specific temperature ranges and other snow properties with varying wax hardness and other properties that address repellence of moisture and dirt. The hardness of the glide wax affects the melting {{of the snow}} to lubricate its passage over the surface {{and its ability to}} avoid suction from meltwater in the snow. Too little melting and sharp edges of snow crystals or too much suction impede the passage of the ski. <b>A</b> <b>tipping</b> point between where crystal type dominates sliding friction and moisture content dominates occurs around 26°F. Harder waxes address colder, drier or more abrasive snow conditions, whereas softer waxes have a lower coefficient of friction, but abrade more readily. Wax formulations combine three types of wax to adjust coefficient of friction and durability. From hard to soft, they include synthetic waxes with 50 or more carbon atoms, microcrystalline waxes with 25 to 50 carbon atoms and paraffin waxes with 20 to 35 carbon atoms. Additives to such waxes include graphite, teflon, silicon, fluorocarbons, and molybdenum to improve glide and/or reduce dirt accumulation.|$|E
25|$|Disputes {{between the}} {{administration}} and fraternities reached <b>a</b> <b>tipping</b> point on January 12, 1848 with the Snowball Rebellion. Numerous students, {{many of whom were}} fraternity members, rolled snowballs up to the entrance of Old Main and blocked it, which was discovered early the next morning by the janitor, who informed then President Erasmus D. MacMaster of the snowballs. President MacMaster informed the faculty and students later that day at a chapel meeting, which all students and faculty members were required to attend, that those involved in the incident with Old Main would be expelled. This ultimately backfired though, for the following night even more students broke into Old Main and packed the main floor with snow, along with chairs, tables, benches, and the entire wood fuel supply for the winter, which then froze overnight. MacMaster expelled all students involved over the next two weeks, and Miami’s enrollment fell to 68 students. However, not wanting to close the university, the Board of Trustees fired MacMaster and hired William Anderson as the next president, who allowed Phi Delta Theta fraternity to be formed in December 1848.|$|E
