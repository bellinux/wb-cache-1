In cooperation with the partner firms, various system studies were carried out with the objective of defining a test hydraulic cylinder, the so-called ''crit. exp. hardware''. This test <b>actuating</b> <b>cylinder</b> was developed, designed and manufactured by Liebherr. - Verification tests (Working Plan Item 7. 2). The aim of these tests was to expose the ''crit. exp. hardware'' to a thermal load (500 C/ 620 C) ambient temperature and 700 C at the unit suspension points. For this purpose Liebherr developed and constructed an extensive test setup which provides this environment. The thermal load was defined in a test program in cooperation with the partners. It contains mainly the determination of the static and dynamic temperature behavior, the so-called ''hot static tests''. The ''crit. exp. hardware'' was tested in accordance with this test program and was able to meet the specification and test program requirements. Thus the functional verification stipulated in the project description was furnished. (orig.)

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development and manufacture of a fluidic variable event control system for turret lathes, which can be programmed to give any desired tool-slide length of travel in increments of 0. 001 inch. The system consists of pneumatic-hydraulic machine actuating cylinders, fitted with sensors to provide machine information, and a control cabinet containing the logic, counter, address and programme systems. Control of events, such as the engagement of the cross-slide, change of feed etc., have been related to the ram-slide motion; fluid displaced from the ram-slide <b>actuating</b> <b>cylinder</b> is metered into either a storage tank or slave cylinders in the control cabinet which, repeat and amplify the motion. Sensing units fitted to the slave cylinders, are programmed to inform the Logic System when the machine slide has travelled the required distance for an event, which initiates command signals to the address system. Programming a selection of events, their sequence and distance to be travelled by a tooling arrangement is achieved by sing multi-channel selector units. Each unit has six programme channels and controls and event, such as the rate of feed for each turret face. On receipt of a start signal, programme channel number 1 of each selector unit is energised, turret face number 1 is presented to the component material and the events programmed take place. When the sequence of operations for that turret face have been completed, the slides return to their starting point. Indexing of the turret to present face number 2 energises programme channel number 2 to control events for this face. This process is repeated until turret face number 6 and programme channel number 6 has been used; the component has now been completed and the cycle is repeated. The programme is not pre-determined such as when using plug board, punched card or tape, and can be varied by shop floor personnel adjusting the programme selector units while the machine is in operation. This feature not only enables component lengths to be adjusted, but as the choice of such events as speed, feed, or when to start the cross-slide may be varied to suit the actual working conditions, optimum production performance is more readily achieved...|$|E
40|$|Polymer hydrogels {{can be used}} {{to produce}} smart actuators, {{constructed}} from lightly cross-linked polymer inhomogeneous networks that contain solvent. Gel actuators are able to change their stiffness with gel hydration, and as an effect of other parameters, such as pH, temperature, chemical composition, etc. In this work, Nisopropylacrylamide (NIPA) gels are mechanically characterised to possibly serve as <b>actuating</b> <b>cylinders</b> and fibres in braids with vibration-damping purposes. Mechanical properties are obtained at different hydration levels and for different cross-linking density, using N,N’-Methylenebisacrylamide (BIS) as crosslinker, and the effect of these two parameters is studied statistically. The results indicate that both the addition of crosslinker and gel hydration yield a quite predictable effect, not far from linearity, on the mechanical properties of NIPA gel, which is promising for their use in actuators upon a wide range of crosslinker content and water/gel ratio. In general, it is proposed that a 7 : 1 ratio water/gel, or slightly inferior, with the maximum possible amount of crosslinker that allows retaining the swelling/deswelling properties, would be optimal for the operation of the actuator...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model and}} its simulation results of an agricultural vehicle electrohydraulic (E/H) steering system. The dynamic characteristics of an E/H steering system {{plays an important role}} in realizing accurate steering control for an automatically guided agricultural vehicle. E/H steering systems are typically nonlinear with large deadband, asymmetric flow gain, time delay, hysteresis, and saturation, which result in difficulties in the system analysis, design, and control. In this paper, a mathematical model has been developed for an E/H steering system. This model has taken the main components of the E/H steering system, including a PWM driver, an E/H proportional directional control valve, steering <b>actuating</b> <b>cylinders,</b> steering linkage, and wheel-ground interactions, into consideration. It was then linearized with assumptions of incompressible fluid, the zero lapped valve, and frictionless. This model has been validated via vehicle steering tests. A third order liner model with considering the deadband, saturation, and time delay could well approximate the dynamic response within the steering angle range of 15 to 15 degrees. The validated model was used to estimate the dynamic behaviors of E/H steering systems in steering controller design. Those parameters are critical for designing high performance steering controller...|$|R

Mathematical model of the mechatronic hydraulic drive has been elaborated, investigation of the working processes in dynamic modes has been carried out.

In order to meet the requirements to the mechatronic hydraulic drive, optimization in the three-parameter space was performed according to the criterium that included setting and overshooting periods as well as the amount of losses in the pump control system. ????????? ????? ???????????? ???????????? ?? ???? ?????? ??????????? ???????? ?????? ? ???????????. ??????????? ???????????? ?????? ?????????? ???????? ?? ????????? ? ??????????????? ?????????????. ????? ?????????? ???????? ?????????????? ????????????, ??????? ????????? ???????????? ???????? ??? ?????????? ??????? ????????????. ??????????? ?????????????? ?????? ???????????? ????????????, ????????? ???????????? ??????? ????????? ? ???????????? ???????. ???????? ??????? ?????????????? ?????????? ???????????? ???????????? ?? ???????????? ??????????????. ???????????, ??? ?????????? ????? ?????????????? ?????????? ??????? ??????????, ??? ???????? ???????? ? ???????? ? ??????? ?????????? ???????, ????????? ????? ????????????? ? ????????????????? ? ????????????, ?? ??????????? ?????? ????????. ??? ??????????? ??????????, ????????????? ? ???????????? ????????????, ????????? ??????????? ? ???????????? ???? ?????????? ?? ????????, ?????????? ????? ?????????????, ????????????????? ? ???????? ?????? ? ??????? ?????????? ???????...|$|R
