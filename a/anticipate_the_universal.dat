40|$|This writing {{discusses}} about {{integration between}} science and Islam. The main purpose of the writing is to introduce a new paradigm of integration {{between science and}} Islam through some models, namely Islamization of science who is introduced by Ismail al-Furuqi and construct a paradigm of Islamic science who is introduced by Ziauddin Sardar. This writing is done by doing research in library and running qualitative research based on philosophical approach. The data is collected from books, journals, and the internet. The study is analyzed through descriptive analysis to get accurate results from {{the objective of the}} study. The epistemological theory that is used in this study is “construct of paradigm” theory of Thomas Kuhn to analyze the dichotomy of science and Islam and how to integrate them. The results of the research are: there are two models of integration between science and Islam, viz. Islamization of science and establish of Islamic science paradigm. The paradigms are very important to <b>anticipate</b> <b>the</b> <b>universal</b> problem of science...|$|E
5000|$|Interest in the {{properties}} of optics, and light, date back to almost 2000 years to Ptolemy (AD 85 - 165). In his work entitled Optics, he writes about {{the properties}} of light, including reflection, refraction, and color. He developed a simplified equation for refraction without trigonometric functions. About 800 years later, in AD 984, Ibn Sahl discovered a law of refraction mathematically equivalent to Snell's law. He {{was followed by the}} most notable Islamic scientist, Ibn Al-Haytham (c.965-1039), who is considered to be [...] "one of the few most outstanding figures in optics in all times." [...] He made significant advances in the science of physics in general, and optics in particular. He <b>anticipated</b> <b>the</b> <b>universal</b> laws of light articulated by seventeenth century scientists by hundreds of years.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the above}} text is {{presentation}} and a critical analysis of the vision of human being contained in Dilthey’s hermeneutical philosophy of life. It is well-known that Dilthey based his early epistemology of the humanities on so-called descriptive psychology that <b>anticipated</b> <b>the</b> phenomenology of Husserl.

40|$|Access to thesis {{permanently}} {{restricted to}} Ball State community only. Porosomes are <b>anticipated</b> to be <b>the</b> <b>universal</b> secretory machinery {{of the cell}} plasma membrane, where membrane-bound secretory vesicles transiently dock and fuse to eject their contents to the extracellular space during cell secretion. Studies over {{the last fifteen years}} have demonstrated the presence of porosomes in almost all secretory cells. Porosomes were first discovered at the apical plasma membrane in pancreatic acinar cells and are manifested as cup-shaped lipoprotein structures in the plasma membrane that possess a central plug. Specific membrane proteins called SNAREs work to establish the continuity between the secretory vesicle membrane and the membrane at the porosome base. B-lymphocytes have SNARE proteins, which are necessary in membrane fusion and this brings about the question as to if porosomes (fusion pores) are present in B-lymphocyte too. This study provides evidence that porosome structures exist in B-lymphocytes, which are responsible for antibody production and secretion during adaptive immunity. By using immunoisolation of porosomes from a rabbit B-lymphocyte (plasmacytoma-like) cell line, 240 E, we were able to detect the presence of SNAP- 23. In the present study, we provide evidence, using transmission electron microscopy that porosome structures exist in these plasmacytoma-like cells, the 240 E cell line, suggesting a mechanism of B-lymphocyte secretion {{similar to that of the}} exocrine pancreas and somewhat different from the classic view of exocytosis.

40|$|Two studies examine if people’s {{inability}} to <b>anticipate</b> <b>the</b> endowment {{effect is a}} result of failed perspective taking. The first study examined the effect of a financial incentive on people’s ability to <b>anticipate</b> <b>the</b> endowment effect, using 40 participants from psychology courses at Connecticut College. Analyses were conducted to test for egocentrism, and to determine how a financial incentive would affect people’s ability to <b>anticipate</b> <b>the</b> endowment effect. The results indicated that buyers trended toward being egocentric in that they underestimated the sellers’ average selling price (p=. 073), and that a financial incentive was not effective at improving people’s ability to <b>anticipate</b> <b>the</b> endowment effect (p=. 917). The second study implemented similarity and difference priming in order to help improve people’s ability to <b>anticipate</b> <b>the</b> endowment effect. This study used 81 participants from psychology courses at Connecticut College. The results indicated that the endowment effect only occurred in the control group (p=. 050). Statistical tests were conducted in order to determine whether people lacked <b>the</b> ability to <b>anticipate</b> <b>the</b> endowment effect, and if they did, if similarity or difference priming improved their ability to <b>anticipate</b> <b>the</b> endowment effect. Analyses revealed that buyers in the control and similarity prime groups had <b>the</b> most difficulty <b>anticipating</b> <b>the</b> endowment effect (p=. 089, p=. 060, respectively), whereas sellers and those who were primed for differences tended to be the most accurate. People seem to need help remembering that other people may be different in order to overcome their inaccurate perspectives. The implications of <b>the</b> endowment effect, <b>anticipating</b> <b>the</b> endowment effect, and accurate perspective taking are discussed...|$|R
