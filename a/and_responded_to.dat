5|$|Feshbach is most {{well known}} for her stint as Tom Cruise's assistant, and for her {{friendship}} with Katie Holmes during the couple's engagement. In this role she traveled with Holmes during publicity for the actresses's film roles, sat in on interviews, <b>and</b> <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> questions about Holmes from journalists. Warner Bros. made special accommodations for Feshbach to accompany Holmes during promotion of Batman Begins, and she attended Holmes' wedding to Cruise in Italy in 2006. Feshbach was later a guest of honor at Scientology's Patron Ball, held at the organization's headquarters in Britain. By 2009, Feshbach had become a high-ranking spokesperson for the Scientology organization.|$|E
40|$|A {{sense and}} {{response}} system senses important {{changes in the}} environment <b>and</b> <b>responds</b> <b>to</b> the change. Examples of sense and response systems that deal with securing critical infrastructure are applications that sense <b>and</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> natural <b>and</b> man-made disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, radiation hazards, fires, and terrorist attacks. Pervasive sense and response systems are systems in which sensors and actuators are pervasive across the infrastructure. This chapter deals with systems in which the community helps <b>to</b> sense <b>and</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> rapidly evolving threats. Dense networks of sensors can be deployed {{with the help of}} the community. For example, we describe how inexpensive accelerometers deployed in homes and offices can help <b>to</b> sense <b>and</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> earthquakes...|$|R

He {{was responsible for the}} ministry's written answers to Parliament's questions <b>and</b> <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> oral questions on education during the Lok Sabha's Question Hour.

5|$|The Finnish labor movement, {{which emerged}} {{at the end}} of the 19th century from temperance, {{religious}} movements and Fennomania, had a Finnish nationalist, working-class character. From 1899–1906 the movement became conclusively independent, shedding the patronizing thinking of the Fennoman estates, and it was represented by the Finnish Social Democratic Party, established in 1899. Workers' activism directed both toward opposing Russification and in developing a domestic policy that tackled social problems <b>and</b> <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> the demand for democracy. This was a reaction to the domestic dispute, ongoing since the 1880s, between the Finnish nobility-burghers and the labor movement concerning voting rights for the common people.|$|E
5|$|When the {{inhabitants}} of Alexandria heard of Caracalla's claims that he had killed his brother Geta in self-defence, they produced a satire mocking this as well as Caracalla's other pretensions. In 215 Caracalla travelled to Alexandria <b>and</b> <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> this insult by slaughtering the deputation of leading citizens who had unsuspectingly assembled before the city to greet his arrival, before setting his troops against Alexandria for several days of looting and plunder. Following the massacre at Alexandria, Caracalla moved east onto Armenia. By 216 he had pushed through Armenia and south into Parthia.|$|E

5|$|During the Battle of Tabsor the 3rd (Lahore), 7th (Meerut) and 75th Divisions {{attacked}} the entrenched Ottoman Empire Eighth Army defending the Tabsor defences. These defences {{were located in}} the middle section of the front line, assigned to the XXI Corps. On their left the Battle of Tulkarm was being fought with the Battle of Arara fought on their right. Together with the cavalry phase, these battles make up the Battle of Sharon, which, with the Battle of Nablus, fought by the XX Corps and Chaytor's Force, have {{become known as the}} Battle of Megiddo. Megiddo developed into a major set piece offensive, when large formations of the Allied EEF, attacked <b>and</b> <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> the reactions of three Ottoman armies, each time following a predetermined plan. The offensive resulted in defeat for Ottoman forces in Palestine, Syria and the Transjordan.|$|E
5|$|During flight, the {{aircraft}} maintains a datalink with a satellite communication network for data and telephone calls. The datalink connects {{the aircraft}} and a ground station via satellite, which translates (changes) the signal's frequency and amplifies the signal; the ground station {{is connected to}} telecommunication networks which allows messages {{to be sent to}} and received from other locations, such as the airline's operations centre. Normal communications from Flight370 were last made at 1:07MYT and the datalink between the aircraft and satellite telecommunication network was lost at some point between 1:07 and 2:03, when the aircraft did not acknowledge a message sent from the ground station. Three minutes after the aircraft left the range of radar coverage—at 2:25—the aircraft's satellite data unit (SDU) transmitted a log-on message, which investigators believe occurred as the SDU started after a power interruption. Between the 2:25 message and 8:19, the SDU acknowledged two ground-to-aircraft telephone calls, which were not answered, <b>and</b> <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> automated, hourly requests from the ground station that were made to determine whether the SDU was still active. None of the communications from 2:25–8:19 contain explicit information about the aircraft's location. The aircraft's final transmission at 8:19 was a log-on message; the aircraft did not respond to a message from the ground station at 9:15. Investigators believe the 8:19 log-on message was made when the SDU was restarting after the aircraft ran out of fuel and the aircraft's auxiliary power unit was started.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Sharon fought between 19 and 25 September 1918, {{began the}} set piece Battle of Megiddo {{half a day}} before the Battle of Nablus, in which large {{formations}} engaged <b>and</b> <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> movements by the opposition, according to pre-existing plans, in {{the last months of}} the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of World War I. The fighting took place over a wide area from the Mediterranean Sea east to the Rafat salient in the Judean Hills. Here the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) XXI Corps with the French brigade sized Détachment Français de Palestine et de Syrie attacked the Yildirim Army Group Eighth Army's XXII Corps and German Asia Corps. The Battle of Sharon extended well behind the Ottoman front lines when the Desert Mounted Corps rode through a gap in the front line across the Plain of Sharon to occupy the Esdraelon Plain. Meanwhile, during the Battle of Nablus the XX Corps attacked Nablus while Chaytor's Force held the right flank in the Jordan Valley before advancing to secure bridges and fords across the Jordan River, to continue the encirclement the defenders in the Judean Hills. Subsequently, Chaytor's Force advanced against the Fourth Army to capture Es Salt and Amman after the Second Battle of Amman.|$|E

5|$|The Buccaneers, {{making their}} NFL debut against the Houston Oilers, {{averaged}} {{less than two}} yards per offensive play. They were unable to score despite being given good field position by two Oiler fumbles. Steve Spurrier completed 8 of 21 passes for 36 yards, and starting running backs Jimmy DuBose and Louis Carter rushed for 12 yards on 15 carries. Despite being outgained 169 to 8 by the second quarter, they were only behind 7–0 and missed a chance to tie the score when Lee McGriff dropped a Spurrier pass in the end zone. A later drive ended when Spurrier overthrew John McKay, Jr., instead hitting defender C.L. Whittington. A third chance to tie the score was lost when Mark Cotney dropped an interception of a Dan Pastorini pass with a clear path to the end zone. Whittington gave the Buccaneers {{the ball on the}} Oiler 11-yard line by fumbling a punt, but then killed the Buccaneers’ scoring chances by intercepting another Spurrier pass. Ronnie Coleman ran 25 times for 142 yards for the Oilers. McKay expressed concern over the team’s offense after the defeat, <b>and</b> <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> a reporter’s taunt of “I thought you said you were going to win some games?” by saying, “Houston has been in the league 6,000 years and still hasn’t won a championship. The Bucs will be heard from”. It was a day with a bad beginning, middle, and ending for the Buccaneers. The day began with the Buccaneers getting lost in the maze-like Astrodome interior, and ended with the team’s charter plane bouncing and rolling before righting itself on landing. In addition, starting tackle Dave Reavis was injured during pregame warmups and was lost for the season.|$|E
