5|$|Aurelian's {{attempt to}} reform the {{currency}} had failed; the denarius was dead. Diocletian restored the three-metal coinage and issued better quality pieces. The new system consisted of five coins: the aureus/solidus, a gold coin weighing, like its predecessors, one-sixtieth of a pound; the argenteus, a coin weighing one ninety-sixth of a pound and containing ninety-five percent pure silver; the follis, {{sometimes referred to as}} the laureatus A, which is a copper coin with added silver struck <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> thirty-two to the pound; the radiatus, a small copper coin struck <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> 108 to the pound, with no added silver; and a coin known today as the laureatus B, a smaller copper coin struck <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> 192 to the pound. Since the nominal values of these new issues were lower than their intrinsic worth as metals, the state was minting these coins at a loss. This practice could be sustained only by requisitioning precious metals from private citizens in exchange for state-minted coin (of a far lower value than the price of the precious metals requisitioned).|$|E
