All four local daily papers gave {{the play and}} the actress enthusiastic reviews, but the theatre critic Lynn Slotkin in CBC Toronto radio show Here <b>and</b> <b>Now</b> <b>was</b> highly critical of {{every aspect of the}} play.|$|E
25|$|Arkansas was 51-16 in 1987, and {{finished}} in fifth {{place at the}} CWS. The Hogs finished second in both the SWC regular season and postseason tournament. The Regional was played in Huntsville, Alabama, and the Razorbacks defeated Middle Tennessee, West Virginia, and Clemson (twice) in order to play in Omaha. Texas, who Arkansas had gone a lowly 1-4 against during the season <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>was</b> ranked #1 nationally, loomed in a Rosenblatt Stadium showdown.|$|E
25|$|Orville was {{actively}} involved in his community, making a point to give back and help those less fortunate. One of the big problems then <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>was</b> poverty. As a result, Jefferson County established a poor house system paid for by appropriations from each town. In 1826, Hungerford was appointed {{as one of the}} first superintendents of the poor house located on the 150-acre Dudley Farm in Le Ray, New York. People sent to the poor house would have a place to live and would be provided with food and rudimentary medical care in exchange for some work, usually tied in with farming, e.g., picking oakum.|$|E

500|$|... "Girly Edition" [...] was {{the first}} episode Larry Doyle wrote for the show. He {{conceived}} both the main plot and the subplot. The subplot about Mojo {{was inspired by the}} film Monkey Shines; show runner Mike Scully asked the staff to consult the film for reference when they were making the episode. The animators also studied the behavior of monkeys from other resources, looking at their movements and how they interact with humans. Eric Stefani, a former animator for the show who had left <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>was</b> part of the band No Doubt, was called back by episode director Mark Kirkland to animate the scenes with Homer and Mojo. This was the final work Stefani did for The Simpsons. At the end of the episode, an incapacitated Mojo is only able to type [...] "Pray for Mojo" [...] into a computer; this line was written by George Meyer, who cited it as his favorite personal contribution to The Simpsons. Recurring character the Crazy Cat Lady was introduced in this episode.|$|E

2500|$|Easterbrook {{has written}} three novels: This Magic Moment (1986), The Here and Now (2002) and The Leading Indicators (2012). [...] This Magic Moment {{is a love}} story {{as well as a}} {{philosophical}} work about the meaning of life. The second novel (The Here <b>and</b> <b>Now)</b> <b>was</b> called [...] "moving" [...] by both the New York Times Book Review and the Los Angeles Times, and tells a [...] "satisfying tale of disillusionment and redemption" [...] in the opinion of the San Francisco Chronicle. [...] According to Kirkus Reviews, The Leading Indicators provides social commentary in the form of literary fiction, filtering [...] "leveraged buyouts, derivatives marketing and multimillion-dollar CEO bonuses through the lens of one … family." ...|$|E
2500|$|In all accounts, the {{appointed}} arbitrator was Sa'd ibn Mua'dh, a leading man among the Aws. During the Battle of the Trench, {{he had been}} one of Muhammad's emissaries to the Qurayza (see above) <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>was</b> dying from a wound he had received later in the battle. When Sa'd arrived, his fellow Aws pleaded for leniency towards the Qurayza and on his request pledged that they would abide by his decision. He then decreed that [...] "the men should be killed, the property divided, and the women and children taken as captives". Muhammad approved of the ruling, calling it similar to God's judgment. Chiragh Ali argued that this statement may have referred to [...] "king" [...] or [...] "ruler" [...] rather than God.|$|E
2500|$|The 1961 Constitution {{provided}} the backbone for the Independence Constitution. A date {{was provided to}} guarantee this legal continuity. An indispensable characteristic of this constitution is the substitution of the diarchic system, which was no longer practicable, by system of only one Government, the Government of Malta, with full legislative and executive powers. At that time Malta was still a colony and responsibility for defence and external affairs were referred to Her Majesty’s Government. There was a clear indication that the road towards independence continued <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>was</b> at a highly developed stage. It is imperative to recognise that the 1961 Constitution established most {{of the features of}} the 1964 Constitution. The British recognised Malta as a State. Another important characteristic of this constitution was an innovative introduction of a chapter covering the safeguarding of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms of the Individual. This is fairly significant because Fundamental Human Rights are a protection for the individual by the State. In the 1961 Constitution, Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms are found in Chapter IV. The protection of freedom of movement was introduced only in the 1964 Constitution.|$|E

2500|$|On 19 January 2011, Architects' fourth album The Here <b>and</b> <b>Now</b> <b>was</b> released. The {{album was}} {{recorded}} across 2010 from May till June at The Omen Room Studios in California and featured guest vocals from Andrew Neufeld of Comeback Kid and Greg Puciato of The Dillinger Escape Plan. The album {{was seen as}} going in a more commercial direction {{from the rest of}} the band's work. The album sold 900 copies in the United States in its first week and debuted at number 47 on the US Top Heatseekers album charts and number 57 on the UK Album Charts. Upon its release the album was well received by critics. Drummer Dan Searle when describing the sound on the album in an interview believe it was a massive departure but also a logical progression for the band, saying: [...] "I completely understand that we are “known” for being a technical band but it’s just not what we want to write any more, I think if you look at the way we have evolved over the last few records you could see it coming. We started writing technical music when we were 16 and have spent the years since slowly moving away from it, it feels like different people wrote those songs." [...] When looking back at the album in hindsight the band has always seen the period the record was released in as one of difficulty and lack of confidence in themselves.|$|E
2500|$|In Calcutta, the Governor-General {{remained}} {{head of the}} Government of India <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>was</b> {{more commonly}} called the Viceroy {{on account of his}} secondary role as the Crown's representative to the nominally sovereign princely states; he was, however, now responsible to the Secretary of State in London and through him to Parliament. A system of [...] "double government" [...] had already been in place during the Company's rule in India from the time of Pitt's India Act of 1784. The Governor-General in the capital, Calcutta, and the Governor in a subordinate presidency (Madras or Bombay) was each required to consult his advisory council; executive orders in Calcutta, for example, were issued in the name of [...] "Governor-General-in-Council" [...] (i.e. the Governor-General with the advice of the Council). The Company's system of [...] "double government" [...] had its critics, since, {{from the time of the}} system's inception, there had been intermittent feuding between the Governor-General and his Council; still, the Act of 1858 made no major changes in governance. However, in the years immediately thereafter, which were also the years of post-rebellion reconstruction, Viceroy Lord Canning found the collective decision making of the Council to be too time-consuming for the pressing tasks ahead, so he requested the [...] "portfolio system" [...] of an Executive Council in which the business of each government department (the [...] "portfolio") was assigned to and became the responsibility of a single council member. Routine departmental decisions were made exclusively by the member, but important decisions required the consent of the Governor-General and, in the absence of such consent, required discussion by the entire Executive Council. This innovation in Indian governance was promulgated in the Indian Councils Act 1861.|$|E
