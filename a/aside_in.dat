5|$|C. Kluane National Park Reserve was set <b>aside</b> <b>in</b> 1976, {{following}} the Kluane Game Reserve {{of the early}} 1940s. Subsequently, an eastern portion of the Reserve became Kluane National Park in 1993.|$|E
5|$|The League Cup {{was clearly}} not one of Ferguson's main {{priorities}} of the season, as he used it to blood the younger and less-known players. After being swept <b>aside</b> <b>in</b> the third round by Ipswich Town – a team {{at the bottom of}} the First Division – Ferguson came under intense scrutiny for fielding a reshuffled squad. However, the manager felt that it was, at the time, an unwanted domestic distraction.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 54,800 beds were set <b>aside</b> <b>in</b> Palestine and Egypt, {{including}} convalescence and clearing hospitals. There were 22,524 hospital beds available in Egypt. A hospital centre in the Deir el Belah and Gaza area along with stationary hospitals between Kantara and Ludd, could accommodate another 15,000 casualties. By August, casualty clearing stations or clearing hospitals were located at Ludd, Jaffa and Jerusalem, supported by medical stores depots at Ludd and Jerusalem. However, the Australian Stationary Hospital at Moascar {{only had a}} few beds available. No. 14 Australian General Hospital on the Suez Canal was full of malaria cases from the Jordan Valley with the overflow being treated in the No. 31 British General Hospital at Abbassia, Cairo.|$|E

5000|$|A long-standing {{controversy}} {{centers on}} which manuscripts represent the most original version. In particular, {{the debate has}} focused on several unusual [...] "clauses" [...] (Icelandic klausur) or <b>asides</b> <b>in</b> the saga which do not fit in with conventional saga style. These have been understood both as late interpolations and as signs of an early, developing saga style (Jónas Kristjánsson 1972).|$|R
5|$|Demerits: However, competencies, {{efficiency}} and effectiveness can be unclear and contradictory, especially {{when dealing with}} oversimplified matters. In a dehumanized bureaucracy, inflexible in distributing the job-scope, with every worker having to specialize from day one without rotating tasks for fear of decreasing output, tasks are often routine and can contribute to boredom. Thus, employees can sometimes {{feel that they are}} not part of the organization's work vision and missions. Consequently, they do not have any sense of belonging in the long term. Furthermore, this type of organization tends to invite exploitation and underestimate the potential of the employees, as creativity of the workers is brushed <b>aside</b> <b>in</b> favour of strict adherence to rules, regulations and procedures.|$|E
5|$|The Boat Captain– A humorous addition, the Boat Captain {{encountered}} Kratos {{on several}} occasions, although these were always to the Boat Captain's detriment. In God of War, Kratos ignored him {{when in the}} belly of the Hydra and brushed him <b>aside</b> <b>in</b> the Underworld. In God of War II, the Boat Captain fled from Kratos as a spirit even though summoned to fight him, and in God of War III, he left a note of hatred towards Kratos in the Underworld and his voice was heard in Kratos' psyche. The character was voiced by Keith Ferguson in God of War and God of War II, and Josh Keaton in God of War III during the psyche sequence.|$|E
5|$|These events trouble Mac Da Thó greatly, {{such that}} he goes three days without food, drink or sleep. However, his wife devises {{for him a}} plan – that he should give the dog to both parties and let them fight for it. Pleased by this scheme, Mac Da Thó takes each {{delegation}} <b>aside</b> <b>in</b> private, and intimates to both that he had awarded the hound to them after much deliberation. Unknowingly, both parties agreed separately that their people should come {{on the same day}} to a feast in Leinster to claim Ailbe formally.|$|E

[...] When excited, Mr. Bacciagalupe frequently made improvised <b>asides</b> <b>in</b> the Italian language, which were obviously appreciated {{by many in the}} audience. Lou Costello, who was Italian-American himself, also understood these side remarks, and sometimes could not stay in character but laughed along as well.|$|R
5|$|Whatever Coke's meaning, {{after an}} initial period during which his {{decision}} enjoyed some support but no statutes were declared void, Bonham's Case was thrown <b>aside,</b> <b>in</b> favour of the growing doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty. In {{one of the most}} prominent early treatises supporting the doctrine, William Blackstone wrote that Parliament is the sovereign lawmaker, preventing the common law courts from throwing aside or reviewing statutes in the fashion that Coke had suggested. Parliamentary sovereignty is now the accepted judicial doctrine in the legal system of England and Wales.|$|E
5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1971, Thorpe's {{political}} career had stalled. He had led the party to a disastrous performance in the United Kingdom general election of June 1970; in an unexpected victory for the Conservatives under Edward Heath, the Liberals lost seven of their thirteen parliamentary seats, and Thorpe's majority in North Devon fell to below 400. Bessell, with mounting business worries, did not stand for re-election in Bodmin. Thorpe faced censure for his conduct of a campaign during which he had spent extravagantly and left the party {{on the verge of}} bankruptcy; but the matter was put <b>aside</b> <b>in</b> a wave of sympathy when his wife Caroline was killed in a road accident 10 days after the election. Thorpe was devastated; he continued as leader, but for the next year performed little beyond routine party duties.|$|E
5|$|In 1955 the US Army began {{considering}} {{the possibility of}} further upgrading their Nike B surface-to-air missile (SAM) as an anti-ballistic missile to intercept ICBMs. Bell Labs, the primary contractor for Nike, was asked to study the issue. Bell returned a report stating that the missile could be upgraded to the required performance relatively easily, but the system would need extremely powerful radar systems to detect the warhead {{while it was still}} far enough away to give the missile time to launch. All of this appeared to be within the state of the art, and in early 1957 Bell was given the go-ahead to develop what was then known as Nike II. Considerable interservice rivalry between the Army and Air Force led to the Nike II being redefined and delayed several times. These barriers were swept <b>aside</b> <b>in</b> late 1957 after the launch of the R-7 Semyorka, the first Soviet ICBM. The design was further upgraded, given the name Zeus, and assigned the highest development priority.|$|E
5000|$|Strabo's 1st-century Geography {{mentions}} the Seres <b>in</b> two <b>asides.</b> <b>In</b> the first passage, he mentions that [...] "some writers" [...] claim the Seres to be longer lived than the Indians of Musicanus, whom Onesicritus claimed lived {{to the age}} of 130.

5|$|Physical {{limitations}} of computer hardware <b>aside,</b> <b>in</b> principle {{it is possible}} to solve any game under the condition that the complete state is known and there is no random chance. Strong solutions, i.e. algorithms that can produce perfect play from any position, are known for some simple games such as Tic Tac Toe/Noughts and crosses (draw with perfect play) and Connect Four (first player wins). Weak solutions exist for somewhat more complex games, such as checkers (with perfect play on both sides the game is known to be a draw, but it is not known for every position created by less-than-perfect play what the perfect next move would be). Other games, such as chess (from the starting position) and Go, have not been solved because their game complexity is too vast for computers to evaluate all possible positions. To reduce the game complexity, researchers have modified these complex games by reducing the size of the board, or the number of pieces, or both.|$|E
5|$|The Emirates Stadium {{is served}} {{by a number of}} London Underground {{stations}} and bus routes. Arsenal tube station is the closest for the northern portion of the stadium, with Highbury & Islington tube station servicing the southern end. While Holloway Road tube station is the closest to the southern portion, it is entry-only before matches and exit-only afterwards to prevent overcrowding. Drayton Park station, adjacent to the Clock End Bridge is shut on matchdays as the rail services to this station do not operate at weekends nor after 10pm. £7.6 million was set <b>aside</b> <b>in</b> the planning permission for upgrading Drayton Park and Holloway Road; however Transport for London decided not to upgrade either station, in favour of improvement works at the interchanges at Highbury & Islington and Finsbury Park, both of which are served by Underground and National Rail services and are approximately a ten-minute walk away. The Emirates Stadium is the only football stadium that stands beside the East Coast Main Line between London and Edinburgh and is just over 2 miles from London King's Cross.|$|E
5|$|The United States Army had {{jurisdiction}} over the national park from 1891 to 1914, followed by {{a brief period of}} civilian stewardship. The newly formed National Park Service took over the park's administration in 1916. Improvements to the park helped to increase visitation during this time. Preservationists led by Muir and the Sierra Club failed to save Hetch Hetchy Valley from becoming a reservoir in 1923. In 1964, 89 percent of the park was set <b>aside</b> <b>in</b> a highly protected wilderness area, and other protected areas were added adjacent to the park. The once-famous Yosemite Firefall, created by pushing red hot embers off a cliff near Glacier Point at night, was discontinued in the mid-to-late 20th century along with other activities that were deemed to be inconsistent with protection of the national park.|$|E
5000|$|After ITMA, Guyler {{worked in}} varied roles from BBC Children's Hour to {{classical}} parts, including with John Gielgud in King Lear. He {{was known for}} his often amusing <b>asides</b> <b>in</b> rehearsals. For a Children's Hour documentary about life in the coal mines, which Guyler was narrating, the producer had visited a mine and recorded most-realistic sound effects. As these were banging, crashing and thumping sounds he was heard to mutter: [...] "Sounds like a Peter Brook production".|$|R

5|$|The {{libretto}} {{was originally}} planned as a three-act opéra comique for the Opéra-Comique theatre. Meyerbeer stopped {{work on the}} opera in 1827 when the theatre underwent financial difficulties. In August 1829, the composer and librettists agreed to refashion the work in a five-act form {{to meet the requirements}} of the Paris Opéra. This entailed some significant rewriting of the storyline, reducing the essentially comic role of Raimbaut (who vanishes after Act 3 in the final version, but whose antics – including the spending of Bertram's money – continued throughout in the earlier libretto). It also meant that the traditional 'pairing' of lovers in opéra comique (Robert/Isabelle paralleled throughout by the 'lower-class' Raimbaut/Alice) was swept <b>aside</b> <b>in</b> favour of concentration on the more sensational story-line of Robert's diabolic ancestry.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} was {{the only}} unsuccessful operation undertaken by the HV since Operation Winter '94 in November 1994, and was brushed <b>aside</b> <b>in</b> Croatia as an aberration. It still remained a subject of controversy in the Croatian media. According to Croatian historian Davor Marijan, the operation was primarily politically motivated and hastily launched in response to Holbrooke's remarks of 17 September. Nonetheless, Marijan claims that the attack was based on incorrect intelligence, leading to an underestimation of the VRS defenses by the HV. In addition, the HV overestimated its own capacity to execute a difficult operation, and neglected {{the condition of the}} rivers that they intended to cross. The HV never attempted to repeat the crossing, instead choosing to threaten Banja Luka from a different direction in early October in Operation Southern Move.|$|E
5|$|The strong odor {{associated}} with marsh shrews (in common with other long-tailed shrews) {{may be a}} means of communication. Similar to other shrews, they have poor eyesight. If a marsh shrew is placed in a foreign environment (such as along an edge of a raised surface), it will run off the edge and continue to run after landing on the surface below. Landing in water, it dives beneath the surface. Marsh shrews are easily trapped in sunken cans, possibly due to their inability {{to see where the}} edges of surfaces drop. In captivity they vocalize when they are displaced or scuffle with other animals in their cage, twittering shrilly if disturbed while eating or in a confrontation over food (such as a worm). Although it is uncertain whether marsh shrews cache (or hoard) food in the wild, in captivity they set aside nightcrawlers {{in a corner of the}} cage for later consumption; no other food items were set <b>aside</b> <b>in</b> this fashion.|$|E

5|$|To detect {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations {{with radio}} telescopes, one must identify an artificial, coherent signal {{against a background}} of various natural phenomena that also produce radio waves. Telescopes capable of this include the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico and the newer Allen Telescope Array in Hat Creek, California. Various programs to detect extraterrestrial intelligence have had government funding in the past. Project Cyclops was commissioned by NASA in the 1970s to investigate {{the most effective way to}} search for signals from intelligent extraterrestrial sources, but the report's recommendations were set <b>aside</b> <b>in</b> favor of the much more modest approach of Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (METI), the sending of messages that intelligent extraterrestrial beings might intercept. NASA then drastically reduced funding for SETI programs, which have since turned to private donations to continue their search.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 season had a minor hiccup at {{the very}} {{beginning}} with a two-point loss to the Blues. Their second round match against the Hurricanes was cancelled, and match declared a draw after the Christchurch earthquake on 22 February which caused 182 deaths. In their first match after the earthquake they played the Waratahs, a team that had only conceded six points in their previous two games. The Crusaders triumphed 33–18 in a convincing display in front of a sold-out stadium. They next played the Brumbies and brushed them <b>aside</b> <b>in</b> a 52–10 demolition. They next played the Highlanders who had previously only lost one match in the season, to the undefeated and table-topping Stormers. The Crusaders won comfortably 44–13 in Dunedin. The next team they played, the Sharks, had like the Highlanders previously only lost one match in the season before the Crusaders won 44–28 at Twickenham for a one off match due to earthquake damage at their own ground. They played the second match in Timaru Alpine Stadium against the Bulls in a sell out crowd winning 27–0. Round 9 they played the Chiefs in Mt Maunganui and gained four tries winning 34–16 with Richie McCaw returning after eight weeks off with injury.|$|E
