25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox. We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>are.</b>|$|E
500|$|Upon {{learning}} of the revolt, the Viscount of Ouro Preto and the other Cabinet ministers went to Army Headquarters, located at the Field of Santana {{in the heart of}} the capital. The supposedly loyal troops there outnumbered and were better equipped than the rebel force. The adjutant-general (Commander) of the Army, Field Marshal Floriano Peixoto guaranteed his men's loyalty to Ouro Preto, but he was secretly in alliance with the rebels. Floriano and the Minister of the War Rufino Enéias, Viscount of Maracajú (a cousin of Deodoro) ignored repeated orders from Ouro Preto to attack the rebels who were approaching the headquarters. He tried to convince them, recalling the acts of bravery by the Brazilian military in the Paraguayan War. But Floriano replied to him that, [...] "in front of us there were enemies, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> all Brazilians", which finally brought him to a realization of how far the mutiny had spread among the officer corps.|$|E
500|$|Despite Morello, Wilk and Commerford's {{involvement}} in Prophets of Rage, Commerford confirmed {{in an interview}} with Rolling Stone that Rage Against the Machine has not split up, explaining, [...] "We just do things our own way. Throughout our career, we never did what anyone wanted us to do. We never made the records people wanted us to make. We never played by the rules people wanted us to play by. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> 25 years later, still a band. Clearly that means something. And if we did ever play or make new music or anything, {{it would be a very}} big deal. And there's a lot of bands that I've seen come along during that 25-year period that did everything the record companies and the powers-that-be wanted them to do, and they sold millions of records. But where are they now? They're gone." [...] Morello added, [...] "Right now...the cold embers of Rage Against the Machine are now the burning fire of Prophets of Rage. Where Rage Against the Machine lives, is this summer in these songs that we are playing. And we have nothing but the greatest love and honor and respect for Zack de la Rocha, the brilliant lyricist of Rage Against the Machine, who is working on his own music, which I'm sure will be fantastic—he's a great artist in his own right. But where you're going to hear Rage Against the Machine is in Prophets of Rage." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was nearly}} sunset when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> come to Long Old Fields, where {{a portion of}} General Winder's army had encamped the day previous, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> met by another {{messenger}} from the commodore.|$|R
6000|$|Campbell: [...] "He {{can forgive}} you, probably, but he cannot forget; we must {{leave that to}} women. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> searching every nook and corner of the house, and every hole and cranny, for that dress-suit, which you'd poked away in {{tissue-paper}} and Chuddah, while you were enjoying yourself at Mrs. Miller's." ...|$|R
500|$|PewDiePie {{originally}} registered a YouTube account {{under the}} name [...] "Pewdie"; he explains that [...] "pew" [...] represents the sound of lasers and [...] "die" [...] means death. After forgetting the password to this account, he then registered the [...] "PewDiePie" [...] YouTube channel on 29 April 2010. After {{he dropped out of}} Chalmers, his parents refused to support him, and as a result he funded his early videos by selling prints of his Photoshop art, as well as working at a hot dog stand. On having to work at the stand, PewDiePie stated, [...] "the fact that I could make videos was so much more important to me than [...] I had to spend a few hours a day doing a job that wasn’t that prestigious." [...] Five years later, PewDiePie recalled, [...] "I knew people were big at other types of videos, but there was no one big in gaming, and I didn’t know you could make money out of it. It was never like a career that I could just quit college to pursue. It was just something I loved to do. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> five years later and it’s exploded." [...] By December 2011, PewDiePie's channel had around 60,000 subscribers. Around the time his channel earned 700,000 subscribers, PewDiePie spoke at Nonick Conference 2012. On 11 July 2012, the channel reached 1 million subscribers, and it reached 2 million subscribers in September. In October, OpenSlate ranked the PewDiePie channel as the #1 YouTube channel. That December, PewDiePie signed with Maker Studios.|$|E
2500|$|In an October 11, 2007 {{interview}} with The Washington Post, Paul said, [...] "There's nobody {{in this world}} that could possibly attack us today... we could defend this country with a few good submarines. If anybody dared touch us we could wipe any country off of {{the face of the earth}} within hours. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> so intimidated and so insecure and we're acting like such bullies that we have to attack third-world nations that have no military and have no weapons." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> {{someone who}} the CIA knows is a fraud, the U.S. Government knows is a fraud, {{is allowed to}} {{sit in front of}} the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and give {{testimony}} as an expert witness. I got a problem with that, I got a problem with the American media, and I've told them {{over and over and over}} again that this man is a document-able fraud, a fake, and yet they allow him to go on CNN, MSNBC, CNBC, and testify as if he actually knows what he is talking about.|$|E
6000|$|We've been troubled {{with bad}} dreams, {{owing to the}} firing out at sea [...] yesterday; and at last I could sleep no more, feeling sure that [...] sommat boded of His coming.

60|$|TROTTER. [wearily] <b>And</b> naturally, <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{all talking}} about him. For heaven's sake, let us change the subject.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{only met}} you this afternoon--a few hours ago. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> {{absolutely}} wedged together on these seats--and my chaperon is dozing half the time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'This is not right, you know, waiter. Look here! here's yesterday's sherry, one and eightpence, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> again, two shillings. And {{what does}} sixpence mean?' ...|$|E
60|$|And I {{knew that}} <b>we</b> <b>were</b> in the {{position}} of a vessel just rounding Staten Island preliminary to bucking the Horn. And, yet, four days ago, we had run through the Straits of Le Maire and stolen along toward the Horn. Three days ago <b>we</b> had <b>been</b> well abreast of the Horn and even a few miles past. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> now, starting all over again and far in the rear of where we had originally started.|$|R
6000|$|She {{hurried to}} the window. The car was a monster at rest after furious adventures. The {{headlights}} blazed on the clots of ice in the road so that the tiniest lumps gave mountainous shadows, and the taillight cast a circle of ruby on the snow behind. Kennicott was opening the door, crying, [...] "Here <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> old girl!

6000|$|... 'Well, my dear madam!' said Mr Pecksniff. 'Be {{that as it}} may, <b>here</b> <b>we</b> are; <b>and</b> being <b>here,</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> to {{consider}} whether it is possible by any justifiable means--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then we were {{chased by}} a French frigate, with the lugger to help her. However, {{we gave them}} the slip in the night, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>are.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then Master Linton has {{forgot the}} first {{injunction}} of his uncle,' I observed: 'he bid us keep on the Grange land, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> off at once.' ...|$|E

6000|$|Then {{we see a}} big bank {{of black}} smoke; {{and when we got}} nearer, it was a city--and a monster she was, too, with a thick fringe of ships around one edge; and we {{wondered}} if it was New York, and begun to jaw and dispute about it, and, first we knowed, it slid from under us and went flying behind, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>was,</b> out over the very ocean itself, and going like a cyclone.

60|$|It was a {{great day}} for Lop-Ear and me. To the east the {{conflagration}} <b>we</b> had started <b>was</b> filling half the sky with smoke. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> perfectly safe {{in the middle of the}} river, encircling the Fire People's stronghold. We sat and laughed at them as we dashed by, swinging south, and southeast to east, and even to northeast, and then east again, southeast and south and on around to the west, a great double curve where the river nearly tied a knot in itself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I {{could not}} refuse, and so, {{to cut it}} short, we were married right off <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> {{the representatives of the}} great firm of Thompson and Company, of California." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{tell you}} again,' said Mr. Indignation Cocker, 'here's yesterday's sherry--can't you see it?--one and eightpence, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> again, two shillings. What {{do you make}} of one and eightpence and two shillings?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The devil, his master, {{sent him}} hither on a broomstick, I suppose: or what matter how? Here he is; <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> worse luck!" [...] And, setting his teeth, Amyas awaited the end.|$|E
60|$|Our {{tour was}} completed, {{in spite of}} all annoyances; <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> again, within the walls of {{magnificent}} Paris! The postilions had been told to drive to the hotel, in the Rue St. Dominique; and we sat down to dinner, an hour after our arrival, under our own roof. My uncle's tenant had left the apartment a month before, according to agreement; and the porter and his wife had engaged a cook, set the rooms in order, and prepared everything for our arrival.|$|R

6000|$|... 'I {{want to know}},' persisted Mr. Indignation Cocker, 'the {{meaning of}} ninepence. I {{want to know the}} meaning of sherry one and eightpence yesterday, <b>and</b> of <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> again two shillings. Send somebody.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There isn't much to tell," [...] said Tom. [...] "We got there, looked around, made a search, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>are.</b> No boat in sight, {{no person}} to be seen, just nothing and nobody." ...|$|E
