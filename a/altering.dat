In one study, {{a small group of}} females with apthous {{stomatitis}} had fewer occurrences of aphthous ulcers during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle or with use of the contraceptive pill.

40|$|A {{powerful}} enhancement to the DMAP <b>alter</b> capability {{was developed}} and is available on all RPK-supported versions of COSMIC/NASTRAN. This enhancement involves the addition of two <b>alter</b> control cards, called INSERT and DELETE, to the Executive Control Deck. These cards allow for DMAP <b>alters</b> {{to be made by}} referencing DMAP statements by their module names rather than by their statement numbers in the rigid format DMAP sequence. This allows for increased user convenience and flexibility and makes <b>alters</b> more meaningful to the user. In addition, DMAP <b>alter</b> packages employing the <b>alter</b> control cards will be much less susceptible to future changes in rigid format DMAPs than <b>alter</b> packages employing the standard <b>ALTER</b> control cards.

For example, female sex hormones are known immunostimulators of both adaptive and innate immune responses. Some autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus strike women preferentially, and their onset often coincides with puberty. By contrast, male sex hormones such as testosterone seem to be immunosuppressive. Other hormones appear to regulate the immune system as well, most notably prolactin, growth hormone and vitamin D.|$|E

5|$|Many {{eukaryotic}} organisms have electron transport chains {{that differ}} from the much-studied mammalian enzymes described above. For example, plants have alternative NADH oxidases, which oxidize NADH in the cytosol {{rather than in the}} mitochondrial matrix, and pass these electrons to the ubiquinone pool. These enzymes do not transport protons, and, therefore, reduce ubiquinone without <b>altering</b> the electrochemical gradient across the inner membrane.|$|E
