5|$|Joseph Weizenbaum's ELIZA {{could carry}} out conversations {{that were so}} {{realistic}} that users occasionally were fooled into thinking they were communicating with <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>and</b> not a program. But in fact, ELIZA {{had no idea what}} she was talking about. She simply gave a canned response or repeated back what was said to her, rephrasing her response with a few grammar rules. ELIZA was the first chatterbot.|$|E
25|$|In Theravadin Buddhism, Buddhas {{are born}} as unenlightened humans, {{and are not}} rulers of any paradise or pure land. Maitreya's arising would be no {{different}} from the arising of Gautama Buddha, as he achieved full enlightenment as <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>and</b> died, entering parinibbana.|$|E
25|$|One key Ich‑Du {{relationship}} Buber identified {{was that}} which can exist between <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>and</b> God. Buber {{argued that this}} is the only way in which it is possible to interact with God, and that an Ich‑Du relationship with anything or anyone connects in some way with the eternal relation to God.|$|E

25|$|Although usually invisible, a kobold can {{materialize}} in {{the form}} of an animal, fire, <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> <b>and</b> a candle. The most common depictions of kobolds show them as humanlike figures the size of small children. Kobolds who live in human homes wear the clothing of peasants; those who live in mines are hunched and ugly; and kobolds who live on ships smoke pipes and wear sailor clothing.|$|E
25|$|Relying {{exclusively}} on unedited machine translation, however, {{ignores the fact}} that communication in human language is -embedded and that it takes a person to comprehend the context of the original text with a reasonable degree of probability. It is certainly true that even purely human-generated translations are prone to error; therefore, to ensure that a machine-generated translation will be useful to <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>and</b> that publishable-quality translation is achieved, such translations must be reviewed and edited by a human.|$|E
25|$|If {{somebody}} kept a {{very accurate}} {{record of a}} human being, going through the era from the Gay 90s, from {{a very different kind}} of world through the turn of the century—as far into the twentieth century as you might live. I decided to make myself a good case history of such <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>and</b> it meant that I could not be judge of what was valid to put in or not. I must put everything in, so I started a very rigorous record.|$|E

25|$|Burt defined sex {{education}} as {{the study of}} the characteristics of beings: a male and female. Such characteristics make up the person's sexuality. Sexuality is an important aspect of the life of <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>and</b> almost all people, including children, want to know about it. Sex education includes all the educational measures which - regardless of the particular method used - may center on sex. He further said that {{sex education}} stands for protection, presentation extension, improvement and development of the family based on accepted ethical ideas.|$|E
25|$|Olivia's {{perspectives}} and inner feelings very often {{serve as the}} focal points for episodes of the series that directly focus on her development as <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>and</b> {{a member of the}} law enforcement community. Critically acclaimed for an evolving storyline, Olivia has highlighted determination and focus as her main traits, according to Abrams. Following a plot line in the second season, viewers are introduced to Olivia's doppelgänger from the parallel universe, which develops an alternate reality for each character. Torv has received several awards for her portrayal of Olivia.|$|E
25|$|Saint Francis’ {{intuitive}} {{approach was}} elaborated into a philosophical vision by subsequent Franciscan theologians, such as Bonaventure of Bagnoregio and John Duns Scotus, leading {{figures in the}} Franciscan intellectual tradition. The philosophy of Scotus is founded upon {{the primacy of the}} Incarnation, and may have been a particularly important influence on Sahagún, since Scotus’s philosophy was taught in Spain at this time. Scotus absorbed the intuitive insights of St. Francis of Assisi and his devotion to Jesus Christ as <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> <b>and</b> expressed them in a broader vision of humanity.|$|E

40|$|Two main issues {{arise in}} {{practical}} imitation learning 	by humanoid robots observing human behavior – 	the first is segmenting and recognizing motion demonstrated 	naturally by <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>and</b> {{the second is}} 	utilizing the demonstrated motion for imitation learning. 	Specifically, the first involves motion segmentation 	and recognition based on the humanoid robot 	motion repertoire for imitation learning and the second 	introduces learning bias based on demonstrated 	motion in the humanoid robot’s imitation learning to 	walk. We show the validity of our motion segmentation 	and recognition in a practical way and report the 	results of our investigation in the influence of learning 	bias in humanoid robot simulations...|$|R

25|$|To refute Hegel's {{claim that}} Christianity should be {{understood}} {{as a part of the}} necessary evolution of thought, or in Hegelians terms, Spirit, in Fear and Trembling, Kierkegaard attempts to use the story of Abraham to show that there is a goal higher than that of ethics (questioning the Hegelian claim that doing one's ethical duty is the highest that can be said of <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being)</b> <b>and</b> that faith cannot be explained by Hegelian ethics, (disproving Hegel's claim that Christianity can be rationally explained by philosophy). Either way, this work can be read as a challenge to the Hegelian notion that a human being's ultimate purpose is to fulfill ethical demands.|$|E
25|$|Numerous popular stories {{throughout}} the world reflect a firmly-rooted belief in an intimate connection between <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>and</b> a tree, plant or flower. Sometimes a man's life depends upon the tree and suffers when it withers or is injured, and we encounter {{the idea of the}} external soul, already found in the Ancient Egyptian Tale of Two Brothers from at least 3000 years ago. Here one of the brothers leaves his heart {{on the top of the}} flower of the acacia and falls dead when it is cut down. Sometimes, however, the tree is a mysterious token which shows its sympathy with an absent hero by weakening or dying, as the man becomes ill or loses his life. These two features very easily combine, and they agree in representing to us mysterious sympathy between tree and human life.|$|E
25|$|Hari Raya Saraswati is {{dedicated}} {{the goddess of}} learning, science, and literature. She rules the intellectual and creative realm, and is the patron goddess of libraries and schools. Balinese Hindus believe that knowledge is an essential medium to achieve the goal of life as <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> <b>and</b> so honor her. She is also celebrated because she succeeded in taming the wandering and lustful mind of her consort, Brahma, who was preoccupied with the goddess of material existence, Shatarupa. On this day, offerings are made to the lontar (palm-leaf manuscripts), books, and shrines. Saraswati Day is celebrated every 210-days on Saniscara Umanis Wuku Watugunung and marks {{the start of the}} new year according to the Balinese Pawukon calendar. Ceremonies and prayers are held at the temples in family compounds, educational institutions and temples, villages, and businesses from morning to noon. Teachers and students replace their uniforms for the day with bright and colourful ceremonial clothing, filling the island with color. Children bring fruit and traditional cakes to school for offerings at the temple.|$|E

He made his debut that year, and scored six goals from 23 appearances as Newcastle finished in 14th place in the 2000–01 National Soccer League table. Newcastle turned full-time the following year, and McBreen played 13 matches and scored three goals with Newcastle improving their league position by ranking second in the 2001–02 National Soccer League table. Despite playing less frequently he enjoyed working under new coach Ian Crook, saying [...] "you can speak to him as <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>and</b> he can man manage. He made training enjoyable".|$|E

500|$|Kanhopatra's abhangas {{frequently}} portray {{her struggle}} between her profession and her devotion to Vithoba, the patron deity of the Varkaris. She presents {{herself as a}} woman deeply devoted to Vithoba, and pleads for him to save her from the unbearable bondage of her profession. Kanhopatra speaks of her humiliation and her banishment from society owing to her profession and social stature. She expresses disgust for the society which adored her {{as an object of}} beauty rather than as <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> <b>and</b> abhorred her for profession. She describes how she has been the object of lustful thoughts. She worries that she was beyond the [...] "scope of God's love". In Nako Devaraya Anta Aata—believed to be the last abhanga of her life—unable to bear the thought of separation from her Lord, Kanhopatra begs Vithoba to end her misery.|$|E
500|$|Many {{philosophers}} consider {{experience to}} be the essence of consciousness, and believe that experience can only fully be known from the inside, subjectively. [...] But if consciousness is subjective and not visible from the outside, why do {{the vast majority of}} people believe that other people are conscious, but rocks and trees are not? [...] This is called the problem of other minds. [...] It is particularly acute for people who believe in the possibility of philosophical zombies, that is, people who think it is possible in principle to have an entity that is physically indistinguishable from <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>and</b> behaves like a human being in every way but nevertheless lacks consciousness. Related issues have also been studied extensively by Greg Littmann of the University of Illinois. and Colin Allen a professor at Indiana University regarding the literature and research studying artificial intelligence in androids.|$|E

[...] In 2011, in {{response}} to LaBeouf's comments, Harrison Ford said: [...] "I think I told [...] he was a fucking idiot ... As an actor, I think it's my obligation to support the film without making a complete ass of myself.

[...] LaBeouf later regretted his comments and their effect on his relationship with Spielberg: [...] "He told me there's a time to be <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>and</b> have an opinion, and there's a time to sell cars. It brought me freedom, but it also killed my spirits because this was a dude I looked up to like a sensei." ...|$|E
