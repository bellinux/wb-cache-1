5|$|On 8 September 1973, a Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) bomb {{exploded}} at the ticket office in Victoria Station, London, injuring five people. On 18 February 1991, <b>an</b> <b>IRA</b> {{bomb exploded}} in a litter bin, killing David Corner, and injuring 38. A general bomb warning for all main line stations had been received by telephone at 0700, but the Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Branch {{chose not to}} close the stations.|$|E
5|$|Thatcher {{narrowly}} escaped {{injury in}} <b>an</b> <b>IRA</b> assassination {{attempt at a}} Brighton hotel {{early in the morning}} on 12 October 1984. Five people were killed, including the wife of minister John Wakeham. Thatcher was staying at the hotel to prepare for the Conservative Party conference, which she insisted should open as scheduled the following day. She delivered her speech as planned, though rewritten from her original draft, in a move that was widely supported across the political spectrum and enhanced her popularity with the public.|$|E

50|$|Retirement: Money {{set aside}} into a Pension (In the US this maybe <b>a</b> <b>IRA</b> or 401(k)).|$|R
5000|$|Contributions to <b>a</b> Roth <b>IRA</b> are not tax deductible. By contrast, {{contributions}} to <b>a</b> traditional <b>IRA</b> are tax deductible (within income limits). Therefore, someone who contributes to <b>a</b> traditional <b>IRA</b> instead of <b>a</b> Roth <b>IRA</b> gets <b>an</b> immediate tax savings {{equal to the}} amount of the contribution multiplied by their marginal tax rate while someone who contributes to <b>a</b> Roth <b>IRA</b> does not realize this immediate tax reduction. Also, by contrast, {{contributions to}} most employer sponsored retirement plans (such as a 401(k), 403(b), Simple IRA or SEP IRA) are tax deductible with no income limits because they reduce a taxpayer's adjusted gross income.|$|R
5|$|Extensive but {{superficial}} {{damage was}} caused by <b>an</b> <b>IRA</b> bomb that exploded close to a snack bar at approximately 1:10pm on 10 September 1973, injuring eight people. A similar explosive had detonated 50 minutes earlier at King's Cross. The Metropolitan Police had received a three-minute warning and were unable to evacuate the station completely, but British Transport Police evacuated much of the area just before the explosion. In 1974, the mentally ill Judith Ward confessed to the bombing and was convicted of this and other crimes despite the evidence against her being highly suspect and Ward retracting her confessions. She was acquitted in 1992, and the culprit has not been found.|$|E
5|$|At about 9:20am on Saturday 15 June 1996, the Ford van {{was parked}} on Corporation Street, outside the Marks & Spencer store, near the Arndale Centre. After setting the bomb's timer, two men – wearing hooded jackets, {{baseball}} caps and sunglasses – left {{the vehicle and}} walked to Cathedral Street, where a third man picked {{them up in the}} Ford Granada. The truck had been parked on double yellow lines with its hazard lights flashing. Within three minutes a traffic warden had issued the vehicle with a parking ticket and called for its removal. At about 9:40am, Granada Studios on Quay Street received a telephone call claiming that there was a bomb at the corner of Corporation Street and Cannon Street and that it would explode in one hour. The caller had an Irish accent and gave <b>an</b> <b>IRA</b> codeword so that police would know the threat was genuine. Four other telephoned warnings were sent to television/radio stations, newspapers and a hospital.|$|E
5|$|By 1888, {{the estate}} {{was in the}} {{possession}} of Fiennes Stanley Wykeham Cornwallis MP (created 1st Baron Cornwallis in 1927), grandson of the fifth Earl Cornwallis's other daughter Jemima Isabella Mann. He owned the house until his death in 1935. His first son, Captain Fiennes Wykeham Mann Cornwallis MC, was killed in <b>an</b> <b>IRA</b> ambush near Gort, County Galway in 1921, and so the first baron was succeeded by his second son, Wykeham Stanley Cornwallis. The second baron sold the house in 1937 and it became the property of Olaf Hambro, a member of the Hambro banking family. Following the death of Hambro in 1961, the house was sold to the Daubeny family. The house and its nearest surrounding land were sold to the Freemasons in 1974 and were briefly operated as a school before passing into corporate ownership.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to <b>a</b> traditional <b>IRA,</b> contributions to <b>a</b> Roth <b>IRA</b> are not tax-deductible. Withdrawals are tax-free {{under certain conditions}} (for example, if the withdrawal is only on the principal portion of the account, or if the owner is at least 59½ years old). <b>A</b> Roth <b>IRA</b> has fewer withdrawal restrictions than traditional <b>IRAs.</b> Transactions inside <b>a</b> Roth <b>IRA</b> (including capital gains, dividends, and interest) do not incur a current tax liability.|$|R
5000|$|Roth <b>IRAs</b> have <b>a</b> higher [...] "effective" [...] {{contribution}} limit {{than traditional}} IRAs, since the nominal contribution limit {{is the same}} for both traditional and Roth IRAs, but the post-tax contribution in <b>a</b> Roth <b>IRA</b> is equivalent to a larger pre-tax contribution in <b>a</b> traditional <b>IRA</b> that will be taxed upon withdrawal. For example, a contribution of the 2008 limit of $5,000 to <b>a</b> Roth <b>IRA</b> may be equivalent to <b>a</b> traditional <b>IRA</b> contribution of $6667 (assuming a 25% tax rate at both contribution and withdrawal). In 2008, one cannot contribute $6667 to <b>a</b> traditional <b>IRA</b> due to the contribution limit, so the post-tax Roth contribution may be larger.|$|R

On 12 October 1978, 55-year-old Letitia McCrory was killed by <b>an</b> <b>IRA</b> bomb explosion on the Belfast-Dublin line near Belfast Central station. The CAIN database indicates that in the 1978 explosion, an inadequate warning was given thus not allowing authorities time to evacuate the train completely before the device detonated.|$|E
50|$|Conversion of all or {{a part of}} <b>a</b> Traditional <b>IRA</b> {{account to}} <b>a</b> Roth <b>IRA</b> results in the {{converted}} funds being taxed as income in the year they are converted (with the exception of non-deductible assets).|$|R

5000|$|Most {{employer}} sponsored {{retirement plans}} {{tend to be}} pre-tax dollars and are similar, in that respect, to <b>a</b> traditional <b>IRA,</b> so if additional retirement savings are made beyond an employer-sponsored plan, <b>a</b> Roth <b>IRA</b> can diversify tax risk.|$|R

5000|$|Regardless {{of income}} but subject to {{contribution}} limits, contributions {{can be made}} to <b>a</b> Traditional <b>IRA</b> and then converted to <b>a</b> Roth <b>IRA.</b> This allows for [...] "backdoor" [...] contributions where individuals are able to avoid the income limitations of the Roth IRA.|$|R
5000|$|With <b>a</b> Traditional <b>IRA,</b> one {{always has}} {{an option to}} convert to a Roth IRA; whereas <b>a</b> Roth <b>IRA</b> cannot be {{converted}} back into <b>a</b> Traditional <b>IRA.</b> One can choose an optimal (lowest tax rate) time to convert over one's life. Because you have a right, but not an obligation, to convert, this is like an option in finance. As with options in finance, this flexibility, which allows one to hedge future uncertainty, adds some additional value to the Traditional IRA.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> gold <b>IRA</b> or {{precious}} metals <b>IRA</b> is <b>an</b> Individual Retirement Account in which physical gold or other approved {{precious metals}} {{are held in}} custody {{for the benefit of}} the IRA account owner.

Precious metals IRAs are usually self-directed <b>IRAs,</b> <b>a</b> type of <b>IRA</b> where the custodian allows more diverse investments to be held in the account. Gold self-directed IRAs can include other types of retirement accounts such as, Roth IRAs, SEP IRA, SIMPLE IRA, HSA, Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), and 401(k)s.|$|R
