500|$|Speaking of {{the album}} cover, Ranaldo said: [...] "in some ways the whole album started with the cover photo, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> of built it up from there. A young Canadian {{photographer}} took that photo of me in September 2010 during an interview session about legendary Canadian group The Nihilist Spasm Band. When I saw the photo I thought it looked so much like a cool album cover. At that point I only had three or four acoustic demos going, and it remained {{in the back of}} my mind that if I ever made enough songs for an album, I’d use that pic as the cover. So that helped push me to develop the songs." ...|$|E

Albini later observed the use of studio banter on Surfer Rosa: [...] "It's on their record forever so I think now they are obliged to say that they're ok with it, but I honestly don't know that that idea would've ever come up if I hadn't done it.

500|$|The {{character}} {{has also become}} a fashion trend. In 2008, American fashion designer Marc Jacobs donned a SpongeBob tattoo on his right arm. He explained that [...] "Well, I just worked with Richard Prince on the collaboration for Louis Vuitton and Richard has done a series of paintings of SpongeBob. He had brought up in our conversation how he saw the artistic value of SpongeBob as the cartoon <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> of liked it, so I did it." [...] He further added that [...] "It's funny." [...] The tattoo was described by blogger and TV personality Perez Hilton {{as one of the}} [...] "Worst Celebrity Tattoos". In the same year, A Bathing Ape released SpongeBob-themed shoes. Singer Pharrell Williams backed a line of SpongeBob T-shirts and shoes targeted at hip adults.

500|$|While {{attending}} UCLA, {{which did}} not have a public speaking team, Cartwright continued training as a voice actress with Butler. She recalled, [...] "every Sunday I'd take a 20-minute bus ride to his house in Beverly Hills for a one-hour lesson and be there for four hours... They had four sons, they didn't have a daughter <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> of fitted in as the baby of the family." [...] Butler introduced her to many of the voice actors and directors at Hanna-Barbera. After she met the director Gordon Hunt, he asked her to audition for a recurring role as Gloria in Richie Rich. She received the part, and later worked with Hunt on several other projects. At the end of 1980, Cartwright signed with a talent agency and landed a lead role in a pilot for a sitcom called In Trouble. Cartwright described the show as [...] "forgettable, but it jump-started my on-camera career". She graduated from UCLA in 1981 with a degree in theater. During the summer, Cartwright worked with Jonathan Winters as part of an improvisation troupe at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} cultural {{references to}} many American and British films. Woods becoming {{a convenience store}} clerk {{to prepare for a}} film is similar to Nick Lang (Michael J. Fox) becoming a police officer in the 1991 film The Hard Way, which Woods also starred in (interestingly, this is a reversal of roles: Woods played the cop that Lang was saddled with in the film). When Kent asks Homer if he is willing to go undercover to [...] "nail" [...] Apu, Homer replies: [...] "No way, man, get yourself another patsy!" [...] This is a reference to a line in the 1991 film JFK. The scene of Homer and Apu riding on mules to the Springfield Airport, with their luggage strapped to the mules' backs, is similar to a scene from the 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia. In his Kwik-E-Mart job interview, the interviewer asks Woods why he would want to work at the Kwik-E-Mart, to which he replies: [...] "To be honest, in my upcoming movie I'm going to be playing this tightly-wound convenience store clerk <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> of like to research my roles and really get into it. For instance, in True Believer I actually worked in a law firm for two months. And then, the film Chaplin I had a little cameo in that. I actually traveled back in time, back to the twenties, where... Well, I've said too much," [...] referencing the 1989 film True Believer and the 1992 film Chaplin.|$|E
500|$|Jennings {{offered to}} record [...] "Willy the Wandering Gypsy and Me" [...] and told Shaver to sing another song – if Jennings liked it he would record it and Shaver could sing another; {{but if he}} did not like it, Shaver would have to leave. Shaver sang [...] "Ain't No God in Mexico", {{followed}} by [...] "Honky Tonk Heroes" [...] and [...] "Old Five and Dimers and Me". [...] Jennings was so taken with Shaver's tunes that he decided he would record an album consisting solely of the Texan's songs. [...] RCA producer Chet Atkins was reluctant to record the material of an unknown writer, but since he had creative control, Jennings decided to record the album anyway, although the executives of RCA Records delayed its release. [...] Jennings was also spending more of his time at Tompall Glaser's [...] "Hillbilly Central" [...] studio at 916 Nineteenth Avenue South in Nashville, attracted by the laid back, communal atmosphere that was the antitheses of the traditional setup that Jennings had endured at RCA since 1966. [...] Jennings brought Glaser back with him to RCA Victor Studios to co-produce Honky Tonk Heroes. [...] "Tompall and I were best friends," [...] Jennings reminisced in the audio version of his autobiography Waylon. [...] "We met at about the time he broke up with his brothers, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> of took their place in his life." [...] Jennings and Shaver worked on the songs for several weeks, with [...] Shaver believing that Jennings was not closely following the phrasing of the tunes, and in some cases he played the songs repeatedly so that Jennings would understand them. [...] The title cut was especially problematic, with Jennings and Shaver - both temperamental personalities - clashing over the arrangement. [...] In Michael Striessguth's book Outlaw: Waylon, Willie, Kris, and the Renegades of Nashville, Jennings drummer Richie Albright recalls: ...|$|E

500|$|Similarly to {{the editing}} process of their {{previous}} DVD Disasterpieces, Crahan watched and analysed all of the footage recorded for the DVD. However in contrast to Disasterpeices this DVD was intended to show a previously unseen side to the band. During an interview in 2006 guitarist Mick Thomson explained that with the DVD the band intended to [...] "bring something new", he also went on to add [...] " [...] more backstage stuff, getting to see more inside stuff {{as opposed to just}} a concert performance." [...] Crahan explained how he wanted to allow the viewer in on more of their time instead of just their performance, recalling a moment when the band were in Australia. He included the footage in the film, explaining; [...] "So I go down to Australia and I go ‘Jesus, there’s bats in the air.’ I’m going to film it and share it with you because it’s part of our lives together. But most bands and people don’t want to share that side of it and I think that’s wrong." [...] Throughout the movie whenever the band members appear unmasked, their faces are blurred, whereas on the second disc, during the interviews, they are completely revealed. When questioned on the subject during an interview on The Sauce in 2007, Crahan explained that when the band perform, the masks are always a part of their show and footage of them unmasked is blurred to represent this. Further adding; [...] "We chose to blur it because, it's really an intrusion. [...] That's our safe place <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> of broke the veil a little bit by grabbing a camera and trying to show everybody those kinds of things that go on." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{was just}} reading {{a review of}} a movie called Watchmen that uses it and the {{reviewer}} said – [...] "Can we please have a moratorium on 'Hallelujah' in movies and television shows?"

2500|$|Charles Erickson remains {{imprisoned for}} the crime. He {{is serving a}} 25-year {{sentence}} in exchange for testifying against Ferguson. Despite his involvement in implicating Ferguson, Ryan has vowed to help Erickson with his release from prison as well. [...] "There are more innocent people in prison, including Erickson ... I {{know that he was}} used and manipulated <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> of feel sorry for the guy. He needs help, he needs support, he doesn't belong in prison", Ferguson said. The Ferguson family has offered a $10,000 reward for any tips in solving the case.|$|E
5000|$|Biographers {{have noted}} his {{sometimes}} excessive drinking, sometimes fragile mental state, and ambiguous sexual orientation. His drinking at times became debilitating. Of his mental state {{when he would}} work, Goyen stated: [...] "Ghost and Flesh ... {{you can see in}} those stories ... wow ... quite surreal <b>and</b> <b>I</b> loved those, <b>and</b> when that was finished <b>and</b> published, <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> of went off the beam. I think the book made me quite mad; writing it, the obsession of that book;…" ...|$|R
5000|$|Lomas later {{expressed}} {{his feelings about}} returning, saying: [...] "I'm really excited. I got the call <b>and</b> <b>I</b> got told about the storyline {{and it was great}} — full of twists <b>and</b> turns. <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> of thought that my character had run his course with the other characters that were around before, but there's a new breed in now, so that means plenty of potential for Warren to come back in and cause some more mayhem." ...|$|R

It was just stupid fun and then, it was about {{six months to a year}} later when I realized there were people reading it and that's when I had to decide where I was going to go with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} with Access Hollywood, Cage denied this allegation, stating that [...] "I wasn't quote 'dropped' from the movie. I {{resigned from the}} movie because I didn't think I {{had enough time to}} achieve the look of the wrestler who was on steroids, which I would never do." [...] When first approached for the lead role, Rourke was initially reluctant, stating that [...] "I didn't really care for the script, but I wanted to work with Darren <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> of thought that whoever wrote the script hadn't spent as much time as I had around these kind of people and he wouldn't have spoken the way the dude was speaking. And, so Darren let me rewrite all my parts and he put the periods in and crossed the T's. So once we made that change I was okay with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Be the Twilight was {{recorded}} in Los Angeles with producer Paul Fox (XTC, Björk, The Sugarcubes, They Might Be Giants). The band wrote 45 songs for the album before traveling to Los Angeles, where they trimmed this down to 12. The songs were influenced by the band's surroundings {{at the time of}} recording, with Hudson stating [...] "here's a whole directness that exists in L.A. <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> of feel that we put that in the record". Hudson said that after [...] "putting all the things you've ever experienced" [...] into Addicted Romantic, the band were able to record Be the Twilight [...] "more in the moment." [...] Be the Twilight took its name from Hudson's fear of the dark; Faker insisted they [...] "name the album after the twilight just to annoy him". Following the release of Be the Twilight, Faker embarked on an album tour, playing with fellow bands Children Collide and E.L.F. The tour commenced on 15 November 2007.|$|E

2500|$|A {{traditional}} {{art form}} of the Cahuilla people, basketry {{is not only a}} community, but a family tradition for Clarke. While his artworks do not utilize the same materials as seen in traditional basket making, he sees his creation process as similar to theirs: [...] "Cahuilla basket makers go out and gather materials, and they put them together to produce something that is both functional <b>and</b> aesthetic. <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> of do my work the same way. <b>I</b> go out <b>and</b> <b>I</b> gather these things.

2500|$|Principal {{photography}} in Vancouver wrapped, as planned, on 15 April, but the production was soon beset by further tragedy when producer William Vince died of cancer, {{just two days}} after model shooting back in London had wrapped. Fellow producer Amy Gilliam, Terry's daughter, remembered, [...] " [...] always said, 'If you get your film in the can, you'll be all right.' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> of believe that he stayed with us to know that happened." [...] Eventually, while on post-production, Gilliam himself was hit by a car, resulting in a cracked vertebra. Gilliam recalled: [...] "So I thought, it was third time lucky – they just didn't get me. They got the star, the producer, and they were going for the director, and the fuckers failed on the last one. Whoever they are..." [...] "They were going for the trinity [...] That would have been a tidy end to the whole thing. But they didn't kill me. I'm stuck here to tell the tale." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harras also commented, [...] "As soon as I saw {{the sketch}} by Walter [...] and heard Louise's take on him, I {{knew we had}} the {{character}} I wanted. Jackson [...] redrew the page, patching in the shadowy Apocalypse where the Owl had been. But the genesis was clearly Walt and Weezie's." [...] Guice admitted to difficulty recalling the details behind redrawing the last page of issue #5: [...] "The best I can remember now is putting his look together pretty much right on the pencil page—just adding bits of costuming business which hinted toward his true appearance when we'd eventually see him in full reveal. I don't believe {{there was even a}} character sketch done for him at that point—I planned on making sense of it all later on, but by then I was gone and others had that concern." [...] Apocalypse's silhouette in issue #5 does not match up with his full appearance in issue #6, suggesting the possibility that Guice was using Simonson's sketch as a reference for issue #6 but did not have access to it earlier, necessitating that he come up with his own design for issue #5. Walter Simonson himself has downplayed his role in the character's creation, saying that Guice was responsible for creating the design and that he, Simonson, merely modified it later: [...] "I did not co-create Apocalypse. However, I wish I had. Louise Simonson and Jackson Guice created him. He appeared in a few panels {{at the end of one}} of Jackson’s last X-FACTORs, so I am the first artist to use him extensively in stories. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> of juiced up his physique a bit." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scherzinger credits Whitney Houston {{as being}} her {{greatest}} musical influence and idol, saying {{she wanted to}} [...] "be Whitney" [...] when she grew up. She admired Houston {{so much that she}} auditioned with her version of [...] "I Will Always Love You" [...] at her Popstars audition. When Scherzinger was growing up in her home town of Louisville, she received a Christmas gift (at the age of six) of a tiny purple boombox and a cassette of Whitney Houston's chart-topping 1985 self-titled debut album. [...] "My parents had no money, but they got me this player and Whitney's album, which had [...] "The Greatest Love of All" [...] on it," [...] Scherzinger recalls. [...] "That was it for me. From that moment on I wanted to sing. Her voice was so powerful; every note she sang just felt like the truth." [...] Scherzinger also named Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Roberta Flack, Sade Adu, Alanis Morissette, Toni Braxton and Tina Turner as her biggest influences while growing up. Scherzinger said that Beyoncé also inspired her, stating: [...] "I am inspired by women like Beyoncé who wear costumes that aren't much but they are real artists and they put real artistry into what they do and that is how I pride myself." [...] Scherzinger said while she is on stage performing, she borrows personas of Tina Turner and Mick Jagger: [...] "The way he [...] prances around stage and the poise he has on stage. But I love Tina Turner's attitude and sass. I steal from her all the time, especially being the lead singer of this group, the Pussycat Dolls, to be fearless and just have that attitude and that soul behind you." [...] Scherzinger also cites Gwen Stefani as an influence. Janet Jackson and MIA are also influences to her. When Scherzinger was older, Mariah Carey became a huge influence to her. She also wished to work with the Black Eyed Peas saying she admired their music. Scherzinger is also a fan of Adele. Critically acclaimed, [...] "Pop Prince", Prince also became a big influence when she was in her teens. Michael Jackson was one of Scherzinger's biggest influences and idols. Paula Abdul, who Scherzinger sat alongside on the judging panel of The X Factor, was one of her influences. When she gained the role on Men in Black 3, Scherzinger said that music was a very big part of her inspiration for the character, which she plays for the film. She said, [...] "I listened to my heavier music and I listened to Led Zeppelin <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> of got in that frame of mind because music is what inspires me most. I worked with my acting coach a lot and she told me about lots of crazy things to think about while I was in character, but I better not tell you what she said." [...] Scherzinger said that the role has inspired her to record differently on her second studio album.|$|E
