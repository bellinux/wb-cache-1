The power station is open to visitors, and around 50,000 tourists visit it each year.|$|E

5|$|Mole crickets vary {{in their}} diets; some like the tawny mole cricket are herbivores, others are omnivores, feeding on larvae, worms, roots, and grasses, and others like the {{southern}} mole cricket are mainly predacious. As well as consuming roots underground, mole crickets leave their burrows <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>to</b> forage for leaves and stems which they drag underground before consumption.|$|E
5|$|The American robin {{is active}} mostly during the day, {{and on its}} winter grounds it assembles in large flocks <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>to</b> roost in trees in secluded swamps or dense vegetation.

5|$|Abra's initial role in {{the show}} was that of Third World rights {{champion}} and humorous surgical , whose major storylines centered on serious rule breaking (including stealing returned anti-retroviral drugs to send to African countries in need, performing an experimental xenotransplantation without authorisation, and secretly using Holby City Hospital's theatres <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>to</b> perform charity operations on African children) {{as well as his}} relationship with colleague nurse Kyla Tyson. Upon returning to the show in April 2008, the character took a darker turn, resorting to self-harm as a symptom of post-traumatic stress, following a harrowing experience in the war torn Congo.|$|E
5|$|Brown bats do {{not claim}} feeding areas like a territory, however {{individuals}} frequently {{return to the}} same feeding sites where they have previously made successful catches. When hunting swarms, brown bats usually select {{no more than two}} species. They feed on more species when they are scattered. If they do not catch any food, they will enter a torpor similar to hibernation that day, awakening <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>to</b> hunt again.|$|E

Boxing magazine reported in January 1910 that his fight against future British and European welterweight champion Johnny Basham was Dyer's debut fight. Both fights are recorded as victories for Dyer, but {{the fight against}} Basham, held in Newport on New Year's Day 1910, was reportedly held back to late <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>to</b> allow Dyer to fulfill matinee and evening singer engagements in Stoll's Panopticon in St. Mary's Street, Cardiff.|$|E

5|$|New Guinea {{crocodiles}} have {{a mostly}} aquatic lifestyle and are largely nocturnal. They {{spend much of}} the day underwater, often with their nostrils and eyes above the surface. Powerful side-to-side movements of their tails propel them through the water and they use both tail and legs to steer. When on land, they favour shady, dense areas of undergrowth. They tend to bask in a group during the day, dispersing <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>to</b> feed.|$|E

The authorities were concerned that an injury could delay the execution. Parsons was permitted to walk outdoors <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>to</b> the place of execution.|$|E
5|$|Pemberton was {{boxed in}} {{with lots of}} munitions and little food. The poor diet was showing on the Confederate soldiers. By the end of June, half were out sick or hospitalized. Scurvy, malaria, dysentery, diarrhea, and other {{diseases}} cut their ranks. At least one city resident had to stay up <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>to</b> keep starving soldiers out of his vegetable garden. The constant shelling did not bother {{him as much as}} the loss of his food. As the siege wore on, fewer and fewer horses, mules, and dogs were seen wandering about Vicksburg. Shoe leather became a last resort of sustenance for many adults.|$|E

5|$|Spending {{the autumn}} and {{winter in the}} open ocean of the cold {{northern}} seas, the Atlantic puffin returns to coastal areas {{at the start of}} the breeding season in late spring. It nests in clifftop colonies, digging a burrow in which a single white egg is laid. The chick mostly feeds on whole fish and grows rapidly. After about six weeks it is fully fledged and makes its way <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>to</b> the sea. It swims away from the shore and does not return to land for several years.|$|E
5|$|The Cape sparrow is social, {{lives in}} flocks, and usually breeds in colonies. Away from settled areas it {{spends much of}} the year {{wandering}} nomadically, in flocks of up to 200 birds. In cultivated and built up areas, smaller flocks form where food is provided for livestock or birds. In such places, it associates with other seed-eating birds, such as the house sparrow, the Cape weaver, and weavers of the genus Euplectes. Birds from urban areas form large flocks seasonally and fly out to the nearby countryside to feed on ripening grain, returning <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>to</b> roost.|$|E
