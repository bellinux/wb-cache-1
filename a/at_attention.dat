5|$|The flag, when {{carried in}} a {{procession}} or parade or with another flag or flags, {{should be on the}} marching right or alone in the centre at the front. The flag may form a distinctive feature of the unveiling of a statue, monument, or plaque, but should never be used as the covering for the object. As a mark of respect to the flag, it should never be dipped to a person or thing, as opposed to regimental colours, organisational or institutional flags, which may be dipped as a mark of honour. During the ceremony of hoisting or lowering the flag, or when the flag is passing in a parade or in a review, all persons present should face the flag and stand <b>at</b> <b>attention.</b> Those present in uniform should render the appropriate salute. When the flag is in a moving column, persons present will stand <b>at</b> <b>attention</b> or salute as the flag passes them. A dignitary may take the salute without a head dress. The flag salutation should be followed by the playing of the national anthem.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{continued}} his coaching {{success in the}} NFL as he took over from original coach, Norm Van Brocklin. Over his tenure as Vikings head coach, Grant was known for instilling discipline in his teams and displaying a lack of emotion during games. He believed that football is a game of controlled emotion and teams would not follow the coach's lead {{if he were to}} panic or lose his poise {{during the course of a}} game. He required his team to stand <b>at</b> <b>attention</b> in a straight line during the entire national anthem played before the game and even had national anthem practice. Grant required outdoor practice during the winter to get players used to the cold weather and would not allow heaters on the sidelines during games.|$|E

5|$|The anthem must be {{performed}} {{in accordance with the}} lyrics and sheet music established by law. Every day, state-owned Belarusian television and radio stations are required to play the national anthem upon signing on at 6 a.m. and again upon signing off (usually around midnight). The anthem can also {{be performed}} on certain occasions, such as at government meetings, before sporting events and presidential inaugurations. While the anthem is being performed, citizens are required to stand <b>at</b> <b>attention</b> and those in military or police uniform must salute.|$|E
5|$|When the {{national}} flag is raised or lowered and the anthem is played, persons in military or paramilitary uniforms who are outdoors don their head dress {{and face the}} flag. If they are in formation under the orders of a commander, only the commander salutes; otherwise, all service personnel salute. Saluting is unnecessary if service personnel are indoors when a flag raising or lowering ceremony takes place. In such cases, persons need only stop {{what they are doing}} and stand <b>at</b> <b>attention.</b>|$|E
5|$|The four British ships fired {{more than}} 2,800 shells at Bismarck, and scored more than 400 hits, but {{were unable to}} sink Bismarck by gunfire. At around 10:20, running low on fuel, Tovey ordered the cruiser Dorsetshire to sink Bismarck with torpedoes and sent his battleships back to port. Dorsetshire fired a pair of torpedoes into Bismarcks {{starboard}} side, one of which hit. Dorsetshire then moved around to her port side and fired another torpedo, which also hit. By the time these torpedo attacks took place, the ship was already listing so badly that the deck was partly awash. It appears that the final torpedo may have detonated against Bismarcks port side superstructure, which was by then already underwater. Around 10:35, Bismarck capsized to port and slowly sank by the stern, disappearing from the surface at 10:40. Some survivors reported they saw Captain Lindemann standing <b>at</b> <b>attention</b> at the stem of the ship as she sank.|$|E

Schoolchildren have traditionally been required to attend morning rallies where the flag is raised after a rendition of the National Anthem of the Republic of China.

25|$|Fasanella {{served two}} stints in reform schools {{run by the}} Catholic Church for truancy and running away from home. He later said he was sexually abused ("used as a girl") by the priests. These {{experiences}} instilled a deep dislike for authority and reinforced Fasanella's hatred for anything which broke people's spirits. Fasanella later depicted his experience in reform school in a painting titled Lineup at the Protectory 2 (1961). The melancholy image features rows of boys standing <b>at</b> <b>attention,</b> watched over by scowling, ominous-looking priests. Fasanella quit school after the sixth grade.|$|E
25|$|After {{the public}} viewing ended, Cuban Army artillerymen loaded the coffins aboard caissons. Commander Charles F.

Accompanying the funeral cortege were Brigadier General William Herbert Bixby, Army Corps Chief of Engineers; Julio de CÃ¡rdenas, Mayor of Havana; Alfredo Zayas y Alfonso, Vice President of Cuba; {{and members of the}} Cuban Cabinet. Six U.S. Navy sailors loaded the first coffins a funeral barge, while Cuban military personnel moved the remainder. The barges took the remains to the North Carolina. As the North Carolina passed out of the harbor, soldiers of the Cuban Army lined the walls of La CabaÃ±a and Morro Castle and stood <b>at</b> <b>attention</b> while a military band played a funeral dirge. Hand-painted porcelain funeral wreaths, a gift of the Cuban government, were placed on the coffins.|$|E

25|$|Hearing {{begins in}} utero, but the central {{auditory}} system continues to develop {{for at least}} the first decade. There is considerable interest in the idea that disruption to hearing during a sensitive period may have long-term consequences for auditory development. One study showed thalamocortical connectivity in vitro was associated with a time sensitive developmental window and required a specific cell adhesion molecule (lcam5) for proper brain plasticity to occur. This points to connectivity between the thalamus and cortex shortly after being able to hear (in vitro) as at least one critical period for auditory processing. Another study showed that rats reared in a single tone environment during critical periods of development had permanently impaired auditory processing. âBadâ auditory experiences, such as temporary deafness by cochlear removal in rats leads to neuron shrinkage. In a study looking <b>at</b> <b>attention</b> in APD patients, children with one ear blocked developed a strong right-ear advantage but were not able to modulate that advantage during directed-attention tasks.|$|E
25|$|The parade {{traditionally}} {{starts with}} the Parade Regimental Sergeant Major (Parade RSM) forming up the parade on either the Padang, the field of the National Stadium or {{in front of the}} Marina Bay grandstand. The command of the parade is handed over to the Parade Commander once the parade has been formed up and properly dressed accordingly. Typically, both the Parade RSM and the Parade Commander come from the SAF, and usually hold a minimum rank of Master Warrant Officer, and Lieutenant Colonel respectively. Upon sizing and forming up the parade to full formation, the Parade Commander will wait for the arrival of the members of Parliament, members of the Cabinet and the Prime Minister of Singapore, in that order (the salutes were dropped partially in 2008, and the Prime Minister's salute was dropped the next year). Upon the arrival of each group, the parade will present its salute and present arms, except for the Parliament and Cabinet members, upon which they stand <b>at</b> <b>attention</b> and only the PC salutes them.|$|E
25|$|The band {{consists}} of 228 musicians. The block band seen at every game {{consists of}} 192 members, while halftime shows consist of 195 members. The other 36 members are alternates. These {{are members of}} the band who challenge the regular members every week for a spot in the gameday block. The alternates also understudy the weekâs halftime show with the squad leader in case someone gets sick or injured before the performance. Alternates have a chance to perform with the regular band members during performances of Double Script Ohio, as well as during pre-game shows on away game trips. All music is memorized and verified during music checks each Friday. On game day the alternates help move equipment around if the show has props or a pit, otherwise they are led by the assistant drum major and stand <b>at</b> <b>attention</b> (minus instruments) on the sideline near {{the south end of the}} field. The band block consists of lettered rows ABCEFHIJKLMQRSTX and D. D row consists of one Head Drum Major, one Assistant Drum Major (who is the assistant to the Head Drum Major), and D-Row members who train and learn under the drum major in order to one day try out for the position.|$|E
