5|$|In December 1970 Gomułka {{scored a}} major {{political}} victory when Poland obtained a West German recognition of the post-World War II borders. The German side secured the right to emigrate to West Germany for the residents of Poland of German identity and to help financially those who stayed by granting pensions: hundreds of thousands eventually became affected. German Chancellor Willy Brandt, who signed the agreement, also <b>asked</b> <b>on</b> his knees for forgiveness for the crimes of the Nazis (Warschauer Kniefall). His gesture was understood in Poland as being addressed to all Poles, although it was actually made {{at the site of}} the Warsaw Ghetto and was thus directed primarily toward the Jews. The notable reconciliation process between the Polish and German nations was initiated five years earlier, when the Polish Church issued its famous Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops, criticized then by the Polish government.|$|E

His will {{was found to}} be contradictory regarding his other private papers and unpublished work; legal advice left the issue to the discretion of his literary executors, who decided the material should not be destroyed. When she died on 15 February 2001, Jones, in turn, left one million pounds to St Paul's Cathedral, Hexham Abbey, and Durham Cathedral.|$|E

5|$|A children's {{edition of}} the memoir was {{published}} in 2014 under the title I Am Malala: How One Girl Stood Up for Education and Changed the World. The audio book edition, narrated by Neela Vaswani, won the 2015 Grammy Award for Best Children's Album. In February 2014, she was nominated for the World Children's Prize in Sweden. Even though she was fighting for women's rights as well as children's rights, she did not describe herself as feminist when <b>asked</b> <b>on</b> Forbes Under 30 Summit in 2014. In 2015, however, Yousafzai told Emma Watson she decided to call herself a feminist after hearing Watson's speech at the UN launching the HeForShe campaign. In May 2014, Yousafzai was granted an honorary doctorate by the University of King's College in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Later in 2014, she was announced as the co-recipient of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize, along with Kailash Satyarthi, for her struggle against the suppression of {{children and young people}} and for the right of all children to education. Aged 17 at the time, she became the youngest-ever Nobel Prize laureate.|$|E

25|$|Siyyid Kázim {{taught his}} {{students}} to expect the fulfillment of the messianic expectations of Twelver Shi'ism in their lifetimes, particularly emphasizing that the Qa'im, or Mahdi, was already living. Mullá Husayn studied under Siyyid Kázim from 1835 until 1843, during which time he was often asked by his teacher to travel to Persia to debate publicly with orthodox Shia ulama to gain more widespread Persian support for Shaykism. During this period he wrote at least two books and gained {{a reputation as a}} significant student of Siyyid Kázim, being <b>asked</b> <b>on</b> occasion to answer questions on his teacher's behalf and gaining permission to supervise students of his own. He received a stipend from the school of Siyyid Kázim for work as a scribe and copyist. Bahá'í sources traditionally suggest that Siyyid Kázim entrusted Mullá Husayn with secret teachings which he did not share with the larger body of Shaykis—a claim which is evocative of his later role in Bábism, but difficult to verify.|$|E
25|$|The Force bill {{went to the}} Senate Judiciary Committee {{chaired by}} Pennsylvania {{protectionist}} William Wilkins and supported by members Daniel Webster and Theodore Frelinghuysen of New Jersey; it gave Jackson everything he <b>asked.</b> <b>On</b> January 28 the Senate defeated a motion {{by a vote of}} 30 to 15 to postpone debate on the bill. All but two of the votes to delay were from the lower South and only three from this section voted against the motion. This did not signal any increased support for nullification but did signify doubts about enforcement. In order to draw more votes, proposals were made to limit the duration of the coercive powers and restrict the use of force to suppressing, rather than preventing, civil disorder. In the House the Judiciary Committee, in a 4-3 vote, rejected Jackson’s request to use force. By the time Calhoun made a major speech on February 15 strongly opposing it, the Force Bill was temporarily stalled.|$|E
25|$|The federal {{government}} <b>asked</b> <b>on</b> April 6, 1879, {{that the jury}} verdict be set aside {{on the basis of}} the Supreme Court's ruling in Carr v. United States, 98 U.S. 433, (a decision handed down on March 3, after the jury's verdict had been reached). Carr v. United States involved a case where the city of San Francisco, California, transferred title to property within the city to the {{federal government}} even though a private citizen claimed title to the land. The Supreme Court reaffirmed in Carr that the federal government cannot be sued without its consent, that a suit against an officer or agent of the federal government does not bind the government itself, and that courts do not have jurisdiction over title suits against the federal government's officers and agents. Only when property has been transferred by the courts does a private citizen establish a right to establish or reclaim rights to title. But the circuit court in Lee held that much of the decision in Carr was dicta, and reaffirmed the jury decision.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had <b>asked</b> <b>on</b> September 17, 2012 the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals {{to place}} an {{emergency}} stay on the permanent injunction made by Judge Forrest on September 12, 2012 The Justice Department wanted the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals to put the judge's ruling on hold while they challenge her decision on appeal. This request by the DOJ was granted on September 17, 2012 when a single federal appeals court judge put a temporary hold on the district court judge's permanent injunction ruling made by judge Katherine Forrest on September 12, 2012. U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit Judge Raymond Lohier issued a one-page order by which he granted the Justice Department's request for an interim stay of the permanent injunction in Hedges, pending the Second Circuit's consideration of the government's motion to stay the injunction throughout its appeal. Judge Lohier's order further said that a Second Circuit motions panel will take up the government's motion for stay pending appeal on September 28, 2012. Lohier offered no explanation or rationale for the interim stay. The Lohier order basically a.) temporarily stayed Judge Forrest's 2012-09-12 ruling b.) puts the whole matter i.e. the permanent injunction on hold c.) allows enforcement of the blocked NDAA section pending appeal and d.) means that the interim stay will remain in effect until at least September 28, 2012 when a three judge panel of the Second Circuit {{is expected to begin}} addressing the issue of a longer-term stay(The September 28, 2012 hearing won't go over the merits of the case, but only deal with the U.S. government's motion to stay the permanent injunction throughout its appeal of the permanent injunction.). The appeal of the permanent injunction date is not yet set.|$|E
