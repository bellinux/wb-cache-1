5|$|By 5 December, the <b>Australians</b> {{had managed}} to {{stockpile}} enough supplies in forward areas to enable the 2/24th Infantry Battalion, which had been engaged in moving the stores, {{to be released from}} this task and thrown back into the fighting. In order to bypass the Japanese position, elements from the 2/23rd along with one company from the 2/24th carried out flanking manoeuvres {{to the west of the}} track were undertaken before the <b>Australians</b> established themselves in defensive positions short of Peak Hill. On 6 December, the remaining three companies of the 2/24th came up and as the <b>Australians</b> continued to advance towards Peak Hill they found considerable Japanese positions which had been abandoned. As movement was seen in Wareo, which was visible in the distance, an artillery bombardment was called in by the <b>Australians.</b> In the afternoon, the <b>Australians</b> cut the branch track that turned towards Kwatingkoo before an attack was put in on Peak Hill. The Japanese defences held and the attack beaten off, the <b>Australians</b> attempted to outflank to the north but they were prevented from doing so by the thick jungle and as the sun set, they had to be content to dig-in on the western approach to Peak Hill.|$|E
5|$|Casualties {{during the}} {{fighting}} around Isurava have been variously reported. In the immediate post war era, Australian sources tended {{to report a}} ratio of around five Japanese killed for every one Australian, with the <b>Australians</b> estimating that they had killed around 700 Japanese; however, in recent times this has been revised. The Japanese also initially over-estimated the casualties they inflicted on the <b>Australians,</b> claiming 1,000 killed, before reducing this to 300. It is now thought that the casualties were more even, although still favouring the <b>Australians.</b> For the <b>Australians,</b> casualties are now reported as 99 killed and 111 wounded while the Japanese {{are thought to have}} lost 140 killed and 231 wounded.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to those <b>Australians</b> who served in North Russia, {{a number of other}} <b>Australians</b> were involved {{on the periphery of the}} Russian Civil War, with a number of vessels of the Royal Australian Navy briefly involved in the Black Sea in late 1918, whilst a number of individual <b>Australians</b> serving in Mesopotamia as part of Dunsterforce and the Malleson Mission. Some <b>Australians</b> also served as advisers with the British Military Mission to Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia and others in South Russia supporting the White Russian General Anton Denikin.|$|E
5|$|Making slow going amidst {{considerable}} resistance, the <b>Australians</b> nevertheless reached KB Mission {{late in the}} day. A {{force of}} Japanese remained there, and the <b>Australians</b> attacked with bayonets fixed. In the fighting that followed 60 Japanese were killed or wounded. The <b>Australians</b> were then able to firmly establish themselves at the mission. Meanwhile, the two companies from the 9th Battalion took up positions at Kilarbo and between the Gama River and Homo Creek with orders to establish blocking positions to allow the 2/12th to continue its advance the following morning.|$|E
5|$|Now {{under the}} command of Hill, and {{accompanied}} by two German prisoners acting as interpreters, the <b>Australians</b> proceeded down the road under a flag of truce and persuaded the garrisons of two more trenches to surrender, but not before another skirmish in which the Germans counter-attacked, wounding three more <b>Australians,</b> one fatally. During the firefight one of the unarmed German interpreters was killed by the <b>Australians,</b> as were several of the Melanesians. The advance continued and another group of defenders was encountered and disarmed by nightfall. By 19:00the <b>Australians</b> reached the radio station which was found abandoned; the mast had been dismantled, although the instruments and machinery remained intact. The surviving defenders had abandoned the defences and withdrawn.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Australians</b> seized {{their good}} fortune and set their fastest time to date with 11.0seconds (s). Having been beaten twice after leading out, the <b>Australians</b> sat back before {{sweeping}} past the Germans and Americans {{in the final}} lap. Australia were again drawn against South Africa in their quarter-final, who had defeated them easily in the heats. This time they equalled the fastest team in the competition over the final 200m, clocking 10.8s to progress to the final, where they faced the Italy. Giuseppe Ogna and Cesare Pinarello {{appeared to be in}} control {{at the start of the}} final lap. They had moved alongside the <b>Australians</b> with one and a half laps to go, but the <b>Australians</b> surprised them at the start of the final lap.

The Italians lodged a protest for interference but it was dismissed. The <b>Australians</b> finished in a time of 10.8s and Browne later claimed that he was convinced by the performance that they would win the gold medal.|$|E
5|$|The South African War Memorial (also {{known as}} the Boer War Memorial or, prior to 1931, the National War Memorial) is an equestrian {{memorial}} dedicated to the South <b>Australians</b> {{who served in the}} Second Boer War of 11 October 1899 to 31 May 1902. It was the first war in which South <b>Australians</b> fought, and 1531 men were sent in nine contingents, with over 1500 horses to accompany them. Over 59 South <b>Australians</b> died in the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the final Japanese assault on the knoll, 292 dead Japanese were counted around 'B' Company's perimeter. In total, {{over the course of}} the battle, the <b>Australians</b> counted 620 Japanese killed, and {{estimated}} that another 1,000 had probably been wounded. Information obtained from captured Japanese clarified that the <b>Australians</b> had come up against a force of at least 2,400 troops. The commander of the 23rd Infantry Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Kawano Koji, was among the dead, as was a senior divisional staff officer, Lieutenant Colonel Honda Matsuo. Four wounded Japanese were also taken prisoner of war. Casualties for the <b>Australians</b> included 10 officers and 179 other ranks killed or wounded, while there had been a further 81 <b>Australians</b> evacuated due to non-combat related issues. Wartime Japanese casualty estimates vary from these figures, though, claiming to have killed 1,800 <b>Australians,</b> while placing their own losses at 280 killed and 320 wounded. Long argues that these figures are problematic, as based upon the same report, the Japanese believed that there were only 400 <b>Australians</b> in the region during the battle, and yet they claimed to have killed almost five times that number.|$|E

5|$|A {{month after}} disappearing the Viet Cong 274th Regiment had emerged without warning and had caught 7 RAR by surprise, with the {{unexpected}} {{presence of a}} Viet Cong Main Force regiment in the Hat Dich forcing the <b>Australians</b> to change their tactics {{for the remainder of}} Operation Ballarat. The <b>Australians</b> became more cautious as a result and while 7 RAR continued its search and destroy mission, only two companies patrolled while the other two remained on standby in fire support bases nearby to provide support if required. Additional artillery support was also made available, with 161st Field Battery, Royal New Zealand Artillery airlifted into Fire Support Base Giraffe. Meanwhile, Graham placed 2 RAR on standby to fly into the area if needed and US forces were also positioned to the north. In this manner Ballarat continued until 16 August, however there was only minor contact which resulted in two more Viet Cong killed, two wounded and one captured for no further loss to the <b>Australians.</b>|$|E

5|$|At 19:00 that evening, {{following}} the clearance of nearby Pakchon by D Company 3 RAR, the <b>Australians</b> sent two companies {{across the river}} to establish a bridgehead and prevent the North Koreans from consolidating their position on the western bank. A and B Companies subsequently established defensive positions {{on either side of}} the road. Shortly afterwards North Korean forces were detected forming up for an assault on the right flank against B Company, and these preparations were broken up with mortars. The North Koreans then engaged the forward Australian companies with mortar fire which was largely ineffective. However, by 22:30 North Korean activity increased significantly, with heavy small arms fire causing a number of casualties among the <b>Australians</b> which perilously had to be evacuated under fire by boat across the fast flowing tidal river. Further artillery support was called-in by the <b>Australians</b> at 23:00 in response to renewed concentrations by the North Koreans in preparation for an assault. Meanwhile, the <b>Australians</b> sent another platoon across the river to reinforce the companies on the western bank.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of <b>Australian</b> dollar {{exchange}} rate and price of <b>Australian</b> coking coal on <b>Australian</b> coking coal export. The quarterly data of <b>Australian</b> dollar exchange rate with the US dollar, <b>Australian</b> coking coal price and the <b>Australian</b> coking coal export from 1992 – 2009 are employed to examine the relationships. This study reveals that the <b>Australian</b> coking coal export has positive relationships with the exchange rate of A$/US$ and price of <b>Australian</b> coking coal. This study finds that the <b>Australian</b> coking coal exporters lose revenues when the value of <b>Australian</b> dollar is high {{and at the same}} time, the <b>Australian</b> coking coal exporters earns more revenues from the higher price of <b>Australian</b> coking coal. The empirical results of this analysis confirm that for each one cent increase in <b>Australian</b> dollar value against the US$, the <b>Australian</b> coking coal export increases by 249, 724 tonnes and for each one dollar price increase of <b>Australian</b> coking coal, the <b>Australian</b> coking coal export increases by 10, 232 tonnes...|$|R
