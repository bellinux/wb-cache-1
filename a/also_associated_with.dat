The immunosuppressive drugs ciclosporin and tacrolimus are <b>also</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> gout, the former more so when used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide.|$|E

This worried the Hittites since they considered the island one of their dependencies. The campaign was launched while the Lukka people of southern Anatolia provided the necessary naval support. The invading force finally succeeded in controlling Alashiya and overthrowing the local Hittite authorities.
