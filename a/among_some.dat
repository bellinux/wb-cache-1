About 35 species of Artemisia are indigenous in Iran <b>among</b> them <b>some</b> are widespread in {{all or most}} provinces, yet some are restricted to some specific regions. In this review paper, initially, GC-Mass results of some experiments done in different provinces of Iran are mentioned <b>among</b> them <b>some</b> compounds are common <b>among</b> species, <b>some</b> others are mostly restricted to other species; after that, medical advantages based on some researches on species of this genus are reviewed; different qualities such as anti-leishmania, anti-bacteria, antiviral as well as anti-proliferative could be mentioned.
