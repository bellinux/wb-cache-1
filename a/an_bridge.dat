50|$|Cao lầu is a {{regional}} Vietnamese dish made with noodles, pork, and local greens, that is {{found only in}} the town of Hội An, in the Quảng Nam Province of central Vietnam. Its unique taste and texture is achieved by using water from an undisclosed ancient Cham well, just outside the town. This story is promulgated in a popular guide book and has become something of an urban legend. It is likely that the unique origin of Cao lầu in Hội An, is due to the town's history as a trading port. Some incorrectly state that prior to the Chinese establishment in Hội An, in the 17th century, the town was also a centre of Japanese trading activity. The famous Hội <b>An</b> <b>bridge</b> (built by the Japanese) also dates to this period. Therefore, some have speculated that Cao lầu noodles could be derived from Japanese soba noodles. However, this theory is flawed, because Cao lầu doesn't contain buckwheat flour. Also, the bridge was built as a symbolic gesture of peace, connecting the Chinese and Japanese quarters, so both trading merchant groups were present in Hội An at the same time. Japanese udon noodles is another possibility, but udon doesn't use lye water. On the other hand, some Chinese wheat noodles are similar to Cao lầu (made with rice flour), because both are lye water kneaded noodles (an innovation that originated in ancient southern China). The dish usually includes sliced pork Xa Xiu (Cha siu), another Chinese influence. There are many variations of this dish in Hội An, some vary the way the pork is cooked (or omitted), using different greens (or absence of mint), sometimes topped with fried pork rind, peanuts, rice crackers, and/or scallions; and sometimes served with lime or chili jam. In the last few decades, new restaurants with modern versions have added shrimp or chicken, and additional herbs. And the pork broth is sometimes blended with dried shrimp/squid or chicken stock. The only consistent item are the noodles. So if you see Cao lầu noodles, then you have Cao lầu.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{describes}} software combining parametric {{geometric modeling}} with {{a version of}} the harmony search method, modified to support multimodal structural optimization. Researchers have recognized the potential of population-based optimization methods, such as genetic algorithms, to support multimodal optimization: that is, generating a diverse range of good alternative solutions, rather than a single best solution. Among these methods is the harmony search method, which has been demonstrated to be efficient in many unimodal structural optimization problems. The paper describes {{a new version of the}} harmony search method, implemented as an assembly within Bentley's Generative Components, enabling high-level control of geometry. The new method is demonstrated on <b>an</b> <b>bridge</b> supported by two inclined parabolic arches, a structure where GC controls a complex geometry with a single variable. Comparative studies of the example find that the new method is more effective than conventional harmony search in consistently finding multiple good solutions...|$|E
40|$|The {{fastest way}} to finish work is to make you of {{computers}} and automation of the business process you might be going through right now. So you want to collect data from the related persons and store them in the process {{to get a good}} overview. To design such a working system you basically need to go through three different processes. First you need a business model (BPMN). From the business model you can derive a ORM database to handle all the data you encounter. Finally a user interface (UI) is needed so that the whole system can communicate with the user. This means you have to work with three different tools. For example Bizagi (BPMN tool), Visual Studios with NORMA (ORM DB tool) and some kind of UI tool or program the interface yourself. As a consequence you have to be an expert with those tools or outsource it to an expert. This is undesirable and the question is if there the possibility to create a tool which acts as <b>an</b> <b>bridge</b> between these designs steps. The focus of this project is to design a prototype of a tool which builds a bridge between the business process model and the object related database model. To make this transition more natural ORM logic based English (OLE) can be used. This language is a hybrid between the syntax of ORM and English. It is accurate enough to describe and build a ORM database from it, but it feels more natural than for example the NORMA syntax. That means that the tool should parses a BPMN model and then, with the OLE input from the user, a ORM database model should be created. ...|$|E
