The influence of different moisture levels (47, 57 and 67 w. b. %), in two loading orientation (longitudinal and transverse) and three loading speed (4, 6 and 8 mm min- 1) on the mechanical properties of pea such as maximum deformation, rupture force, rupture energy, toughness {{and the power to}} break the pea was investigated. It was observed in the physical properties that moisture changes were affective at 1 % on, dimensions, geometric mean diameter, volume, sphericity index and the surface area. It was observed in the mechanical properties that moisture changes <b>were</b> <b>effective</b> at 1 % on, maximum deformation, rupture force, rupture energy, toughness and the power to break. Loading speed <b>was</b> <b>effective</b> on maximum deformation, rupture force, rupture energy at 1 % and it <b>was</b> <b>effective</b> on toughness at 5 %. Loading orientation <b>was</b> <b>effective</b> on maximum deformation, rupture force, rupture energy, toughness at 1 % and it <b>was</b> <b>effective</b> on power at 5 %.

5|$|Untreated {{streptococcal pharyngitis}} usually {{resolves}} {{within a few}} days. Treatment with antibiotics shortens {{the duration of the}} acute illness by about 16hours.

5|$|An {{elevated}} core temperature, {{leading to}} increased symptom presentation {{has been noted}} during exercise, due to variations in circadian body temperature throughout the day, and due to heat exposure including warm temperatures, warm showers, sun bathing, etc. Care should be taken not to overheat a person with MS {{during the course of}} exercise. There is some evidence that cooling measures <b>are</b> <b>effective</b> in allowing a greater degree of exercise: cold showers, cold water limb immersion, applying ice packs, and drinking cold beverages. These strategies <b>are</b> <b>effective</b> when attempting to decrease core temperature post-exercise, and as a method of pre-cooling prior to physical activity or heat exposure. The interaction between an elevated core temperature and the pathological demyelination can cause a transient nerve conduction block that leads to temporarily impaired physical and cognitive function. These effects translate to reduced patient safety and performance of ADLs, however there are viable prevention strategies. Behavioral strategies to minimize heat exposure include performing outdoor physical activity when temperatures are cooler, or installing an air conditioner.|$|E

5|$|Benzodiazepines <b>are</b> <b>effective</b> as {{medication}} given {{a couple}} of hours before surgery to relieve anxiety. They also produce amnesia, which can be useful, as patients may not remember unpleasantness from the procedure. They are also used in patients with dental phobia as well as some ophthalmic procedures like refractive surgery; although such use is controversial and only recommended for those who are very anxious. Midazolam is the most commonly prescribed for this use because of its strong sedative actions and fast recovery time, as well as its water solubility, which reduces pain upon injection. Diazepam and lorazepam are sometimes used. Lorazepam has particularly marked amnesic properties that may make it more effective when amnesia is the desired effect.|$|E

5|$|Combination therapy—using {{medications}} {{of different}} classes together, {{each with a}} different mechanism of action—has been demonstrated {{to be a more}} efficacious approach to acne treatment than monotherapy.

Similarly, using a topical retinoid with an antibiotic clears acne lesions faster than the use of antibiotics alone. Frequently used combinations include the following: antibiotic and benzoyl peroxide, antibiotic and topical retinoid, or topical retinoid and benzoyl peroxide. The pairing of benzoyl peroxide with a retinoid is preferred over the combination of a topical antibiotic with a retinoid since both regimens <b>are</b> <b>effective</b> but benzoyl peroxide does not lead to antibiotic resistance.|$|E

5|$|Following their {{respective}} breeding seasons, {{several species of}} hummingbirds occur at the same locations in North America, and several hummingbird flowers bloom simultaneously in these habitats. These flowers have converged to a common morphology and color because these <b>are</b> <b>effective</b> at attracting the birds.

Tubular flowers force a bird to orient its bill {{in a particular way}} when probing the flower, especially when the bill and corolla are both curved. This allows the plant to place pollen on a certain part of the bird's body, permitting a variety of morphological co-adaptations.|$|E
