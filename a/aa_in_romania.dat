40|$|Background: Aristolochic acid (AA) is a nephrotoxicant {{associated}} with AA nephropathy (AAN) and upper urothelial tract cancer (UUTC). Whole-genome sequences of 14 Romanian cases of {{renal cell carcinoma}} (RCC) recently exhibited mutational signatures consistent with AA exposure, although RCC had not been previously linked with AAN and AA exposure was previously reported only in localised rural areas. Methods: We performed mass spectrometric measurements of the aristolactam (AL) DNA adduct 7 -(deoxyadenosin-N 6 -yl) aristolactam I (dA-AL-I) in nontumour renal tissues of the 14 Romanian RCC cases and 15 cases from 3 other countries. Results: We detected dA-AL-I in the 14 Romanian cases at levels ranging from 0. 7 to 27 adducts per 108 DNA bases, in line with levels reported in Asian and Balkan populations exposed through herbal remedies or food contamination. The 15 cases from other countries were negative. Interpretation: Although the source of exposure is uncertain and likely different in AAN regions than elsewhere, our results demonstrate that <b>AA</b> exposure <b>in</b> <b>Romania</b> exists outside localised AAN regions and provide further evidence implicating <b>AA</b> <b>in</b> RCC...|$|R

The paper takes stock of prior findings on health inequalities <b>in</b> <b>Romania</b> and sets out to explore the pattern of inequalities in self-reported health status <b>in</b> <b>Romania</b> <b>in</b> comparison to ten NMS and EU 15. Drawing on individual data gathered on national representative samples through European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS), a logistic regression {{was carried out in}} order to assess the role of individual and contextual factors in shaping the patterns of inequalities in self-reported health <b>in</b> <b>Romania</b> <b>in</b> comparison to two major groups of European countries. Research findings indicate that individual factors like age, gender, education, employment status and income are key to understanding inequalities in self-rated health <b>in</b> <b>Romania</b> and the analysed groups of countries, this proving to a universal pattern. Contextual factors proved to be less important in determining self-rated health <b>in</b> <b>Romania</b> while they may play a more important role in two groups of countries considered here. Inequalities are more pronounced <b>in</b> <b>Romania</b> <b>in</b> what regards sex and education in comparison to the two analysed groups of countries. Evaluation of health services is a crucial factor <b>in</b> <b>Romania</b> and the two groups of countries in self-rated health while the role of environmental factors is not important <b>in</b> <b>Romania</b> and varies <b>in</b> the country between NMS 10 and EU 15...|$|R
