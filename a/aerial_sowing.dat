40|$|The cost of {{irrigation}} water accounts for 20 - 30 % {{of the total}} variable costs of rice production in the Murrumbidgee and Murray Valleys. Rice production consumes a substantial proportion of the available supply {{of irrigation}} water. Any agronomic/water management practice {{that has the potential}} to reduce water use should be investigated. Research in the Burdekin River Irrigation Area indicated that crop water use of rice grown on raised beds was 32 % less than when grown using conventional permanent flood. Whilst recognising that there are likely to be agronomic constraints to rice production on raised beds in the Riverina, investigations into potential water savings, were investigated in this project. The project evaluated the water use efficiency of rice grown on a raised bed layout on two of the principal soil types used for rice production (four experiments). This layout was compared with the now traditional <b>aerial</b> <b>sown</b> fully ponded flat layout. The opportunity to explore water management options on the raised bed layout was also undertaken in three of the experiments. Water use was quantified and agronomic performance of the rice crop monitored...|$|R

40|$|Summary: Sodium monofluoroacetate (1080) is {{a highly}} toxic {{vertebrate}} pesticide that has been widely used for possum and rabbit control in New Zealand since the 1950 s. Because of its importance in pest control and the highly toxic nature of this compound, its environmental fate, persistence, non-target impacts and general toxicology have been {{and continue to be}} extensively studied. A series of in vitro (cell culture) and laboratory animal studies (in rats and mice) have recently been undertaken to update the regulatory toxicology database for 1080. Results of three different, complementary tests indicate that 1080 is not mutagenic, and therefore unlikely to cause cancer. Results of developmental toxicity studies indicate that 1080 causes developmental defects in rats when pregnant females are exposed to relatively high doses (0. 33 and 0. 75 mg kg- 1 day- 1) on a daily basis during the period of organogenesis (from days 6 through to 17 of gestation). The developmental abnormalities observed were mild skeletal effects: slightly curved forelimbs, and bent or “wavy ” ribs. These results highlight the highly toxic nature of 1080 and the need for extreme care when handling this pesticide during the manufacture and distribution of bait, but do not preclude its proper use. The morphological changes in foetuses observed in the recently completed rat developmental toxicity studies are likely to raise concern regarding the exposure of humans (particularly pregnant mothers) to 1080 through contamination of waterways after the <b>aerial</b> <b>sowing</b> of 1080 baits. However, ongoing monitoring (1990 – 98) of waterways fro...|$|E

40|$|Winter cereal rye (Secale cereal L.), a {{commonly}} used cover crop in corn (Zea mays L.) systems has potential to scavenge soil NO 3 –N through a fibrous root system. The {{objective of this}} study was to quantify root and shoot biomass, C, and N partitioning in rye cover crop at the time of termination in spring. This was a one–year study conducted at a site with a no-till corn–soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr. ] rotation, rye drilled following grain crop harvest, and three N rates applied to corn (0, 135, and 225 kg N ha– 1). Rye root biomass to 60 -cm depth following corn and 30 -cm depth following soybean was estimated using ingrowth tubes installed in the fall after rye seeding and removed at the time of rye termination in the spring. For rye following corn and soybean, 48 and 62 %, respectively, of the total root biomass was present in the top 15 -cm depth. Overall, the shoot biomass, C, and N was significantly greater than for roots, with approximately two times more shoot than root material and only 33 – 36 % of total plant C and 17 – 18 % of total plant N in the root biomass. The C:N ratio of root biomass was consistently high (47 – 52), and at least double the shoot (16 – 23). With high C, low N, and high C:N ratio of the rye roots, inorganic-N from soil or degrading shoot biomass could be immobilized with root degradation and reduce potential N recycling. Cereal rye (Secale cereal L.) cover crops (RCC) have good potential to take up residual NO 3 between grain crops and reduce loss to surface waters. However, studies in Iowa have shown a 5 – 6 % corn (Zea mays L.) yield reduction when grown following a RCC. The objective of this research was to study agronomic practices that have potential to improve corn yield in a RCC system. This study was conducted at four sites in 2013 through 2015 with corn grown in rotation with soybean [Glycine max. (L.) Merr. ]. Treatments included cereal rye aerially broadcast into soybean before leaf drop and no RCC, tillage or no-till, and starter N fertilizer (34 kg N ha– 1) or no starter. The <b>aerial</b> RCC <b>sowing,</b> especially with dry fall conditions the first year and planned RCC termination in the spring at 15 – 20 cm height, resulted in non-uniform RCC stand and low biomass and N uptake at termination (154 – 335 kg ha– 1 and 6 – 14 kg N ha– 1). Across site-years, V 6 corn plant height and V 10 sensing indexes were greater with the tilled system and starter N. Overall, corn yield was slightly reduced with the RCC (2. 4 %), however, tillage (3. 3 %) and the high N starter (1. 6 %) consistently increased yield. Soybean yield was not influenced by the aerial seeded RCC or the prior year treatments for corn. While the RCC generally resulted in lower corn yield, starter N and tillage did help offset that reduction and would be expected to help improve corn production in a RCC system...|$|R

Plant density and nitrogen on prowth, yield and yield components of three rice varieties [...] VI. The nitrogen economy of rice crops [...] VII. References [...] VIII. Index. The climate of the Murrumbidgee Irrigation areas varies only slightly regionally; the long summer days with high solar radiation allow a growing season of 190 - 200 days and are conducive to high yields. Nevertheless, appreciable variations in annual yields occur, these being associated with low temperatures at sowing and particularly at flowering. A high proportion of sterile florets are induced with minimum temperatures of less than 15 °C, this effect being accentuated by high concentrations of nitrogen. Two series of field experiments were made at two sowing dates over two seasons. In one series the varieties Calrose, Kulu and Baru were sown either by combine or aerially with three rates of nitrogen fertiliser. In the other the same three varieties were compared at two densities and two rates of nitrogen supply. Detailed growth analyses were made from fortnightly harvests. <b>Aerial</b> <b>sowing</b> gave the most rapid early growth leading to a large leaf area, especially with high nitrogen. Lodging later in the season was encouraged and the yield was frequently reduced below that of combine-sown rice with an intermediate supply of nitrogen, the yield reduction being reflected by a high degree of floret sterility and low grain weight. These and other differences between the varieties and the. treatments explored were analysed in detail throughout the season. One interesting effect was an apparent increase in growth rate late in the season. Low density resulted in slow early growth but differences between densities narrowed during grain-filling. Nitrogen had a larger effect than density. Calrose appeared to be the best adapted variety, tillering more profusely than the thick-stemmed Baru with its large panicle. Although Baru had the highest potential for yield, this was rarely realised mainly because of high floret sterility. Kulu tillered too profusely and was also prone to floret sterility. A reasonable detailed analyses of the nitrogen balance was made. The rate of nitrification during fallow was about O. 46 ppm d ̄ ¹ and after adding sulphate of ammonia this rose to 2. 2 ppm d ̄ ¹during the germinating period prior to permanent flood. Denitrification is extremely rapid after permanent flood. Ammonium ions are not lost when reducing conditions are induced; hence the most effective use of nitrogen is obtained with <b>aerial</b> <b>sowing</b> or applying it just before permanent flood after combine sowing. Then 30. 6 % of that applied was recovered in the crop compared with 16 % when combined in with the seed.

40|$|In September 1962 the Tussock Grasslands and Mountain Lands Institute {{produced}} a Directory of Research listing projects and personnel {{concerned with the}} tussock grasslands and mountain lands. The number of people involved was about 100 {{and the number of}} separate projects more than 150. It is obvious that, in trying to survey advances being made in the tussock grasslands, I cannot mention more than a few of these workers. Everyone has his own definition of tussock grassland and the area involved, but I am discussing some 11, 000, 000 acres, mainly in the South Island, carrying {{about two and a half}} million sheep and 40, 000 cattle and having an importance to the New Zealand economy which cannot be assessed in stock numbers alone. In sheep equivalents these lands could be claimed to carry about one to four acres but in places so much of the area is devoid of vegetation that stocking rates in the conventional sense mean little. Wool is the basic product, yielding at least 80 per cent of the gross return, and the flocks consist of over half Merinos, a little less than one-third half-breds, and one-sixth Corriedales. I propose to review only some of the advances made since 1950. In that year a statement was made at this Association’s conference that “to New Zealand as a whole the tussock grasslands are of value for one purpose only, that is, the feeding of livestock”. That statement went unchallenged. I think most people in New Zealand would now agree on the importance of the tussock grasslands from the point of view of soil and water conservation, of their value in regulating stream-flow for stock water on the plains, for the generation of hydro-electricity, and for irrigation. Another statement made was not challenged either. I quote: “It is, however, necessary to consider carefully whether or not a legume should be introduced into unploughable tussock country. That it is possible has been demonstrated on a number of occasions. It is, however, doubtful if it is advisable. It is unlikely to be profitable.... ” The year 1950 is also important because by then the trials on <b>aerial</b> <b>sowing</b> of seed and fertiliser organised and financed by the Soil Conservation and Rivers Control Council, urged on by D.

40|$|Clearfelling of wet {{eucalypt}} forest {{followed by}} high intensity burning and <b>aerial</b> <b>sowing,</b> a silvicultural system {{used for the}} last 50 years in Tasmania and designed to mimic the natural dynamic of sporadic regeneration following cataclysmic disturbance, has attracted criticism for not maintaining the structural or floristic diversity {{that is associated with}} natural disturbance. To address these concerns, a silvicultural systems trial was established at the Warra Long-Term Ecological Research site in southern Tasmania to quantify the effect on these values if variable-retention harvesting systems are applied to tall wet eucalypt forest. The harvesting treatments were clearfell, burn and sow with understorey islands, a patchfell, stripfell, dispersed retention, aggregated retention, single-tree/small-group selection and group selection. High intensity burning, low intensity burning and no burning were variously applied as part of these treatments. Stocking, density and growth of the eucalypt seedling regeneration, floristic changes and the structural integrity of retained forest areas were monitored for up to ten years after harvesting and regeneration treatments were applied from 1998 to 2007. The nature of the seedbed in each coupe was related to the harvesting and regeneration treatment. Where high intensity burns were applied there was a higher proportion of burnt seedbed available than in coupes where low intensity burns were applied. The highest eucalypt seedling densities and fastest early growth rates occurred on the hottest burnt seedbeds. The lowest seedling densities occurred on unburnt and undisturbed seedbeds and the slowest early growth rates occurred on unburnt and compacted seedbeds. Treatments that created the most burnt seedbed had the highest eucalypt seedling densities and mean seedling growth rates. The floristic response in any given coupe following the harvesting and burning disturbance was related to the pre-harvesting floristics and not to the silvicultural system. Rainforest species present in the understorey prior to harvesting were also present in the post-harvesting vegetation, albeit at lower levels. Sclerophyll dominated understoreys regenerated with a very similar species composition to that pre-harvesting. Damage to the edges of retained forest areas was minimal, except for the smallest areas, which were prone to windthrow and were often burnt during the regeneration burn. Larger areas persisted intact throughout the harvesting and burning operations and for the first few years after those disturbances. Of the silvicultural systems examined in this study, aggregated retention is considered the most promising alternative to clearfelling. High intensity burns as applied to clearfell burn and sow coupes cannot be conducted in aggregated retention coupes as they would probably burn the aggregates. The lower proportion of burnt seedbed resulting will, on average, lead to lower seedling density and growth rates, and may compromise longer term productivity compared to clearfelled and high-intensity-burnt coupes. If aggregated retention is to be successfully applied, as measured by the density and height growth of the regeneration, finding ways of successfully and consistently burning such coupes post-harvesting will be essential...|$|E
