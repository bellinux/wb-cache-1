30|$|Castell-Perez et al. (1991) {{proposed}} {{the use of}} an <b>anchor</b> <b>stirrer</b> for fluids with complex rheology. They recommended the use of mixer-viscometer when dealing with characterization of mixtures that could separate, i.e., suspensions with particles that could settle, deposit, or aggregate. La Fluente et al. (1996) studied fluids with complex rheology using helical blades impellers. They observed that impeller pitch and blade width did not affect the shear rate coefficient (the constant of proportionality between shear rate and rotational speed).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} paper, we have {{described}} in-depth numerical {{study of the}} basic fluid mechanics problem of yield stress fluid flow with regularization model of Berovier and Engelman in a cylindrical vessel not chicaned equipped with an <b>anchor</b> <b>stirrer</b> by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based on the finite volumes method discretization of Navier- Stokes equations formulated in variables (U. V. P). We study the effect of inertia and the yield stress influence by the variation of Hedström number on the flow; we have analyzed also the influence of rheological parameters on the hydrodynamic flow behavior, such as the velocity components and the power consumption...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} the {{characterization}} of hydrodynamic fields of incompressible yield stress fluid with regularization model of Bercovier and Engelman in a cylindrical vessel not chicaned equipped with circular <b>anchor</b> <b>stirrer</b> was undertaken by means of numerical simulation using computational fluid dynamics. Simulations flow of a Bingham fluid agitated by straights blades anchor was used to validate the rheological model implemented of the fluid treated. The flow structures, and especially the effect of inertia, the plasticity and the yield stress, are discussed. We have analyzed also the influence of rheological parameters on the hydrodynamic flow behaviours, such as the velocity components and the global characteristic like power consumption. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of scale-up for applications of enzymatic solid-to-solid synthesis of dipeptides was investigated by using Thermoase catalyzed synthesis of Z-Asp-Phe-OMe {{as a model}} reaction. The reaction system involves typically only 10 % (w/w) enzyme suspension added to dry solid substrates. Enzymatic solid-to-solid biocatalysis combines the main advantages of aqueous media, high catalytic activity, low water media, and high yields. A flow sheet for the whole process is described, {{as well as the}} use of a jacketed reactor with an <b>anchor</b> <b>stirrer</b> for various steps of the process, including the neutralization reaction to adjust the acid-base condition of the reaction mixture. A solution for enzyme recycling, an important issue for scale-up applications, is also suggested...|$|E
30|$|The {{stability}} of Biolacta N 5 {{was investigated in}} a 0, 5.0, and 30 % (w/w) lactose-in-buffer solution in a temperature controlled batch reactor with an <b>anchor</b> <b>stirrer</b> at 150  rpm. A certain mass of lactose monohydrate and a certain mass of buffer were weighted, so that a final concentration of lactose was obtained on a weight basis of 5 % and 30 % (w/w). 30 % (w/w) lactose {{is close to the}} solubility at 50 °C. The lactose was dissolved at approximately 60 °C prior to cooling the solution to the desired temperature. The initial reaction volume was 25  mL. Temperatures were kept at 25, 40, or 60 °C. A volume of 1.0  mL of 2.0  g∙L- 1 Biolacta N 5 was added once the temperature was constant. Samples were taken at 30  s, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 360  minutes and 22, and 24  hours for determination of the carbohydrate composition (100  μL sample) and for determination of the enzyme activity (210  μL sample). The final reaction volume was 21  mL.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{was based on}} the premise that vegetable oils may present a viable alternative to petrochemical feedstocks for the creation of epoxy resins. Vegetable oils are a natural and renewable product in an age of dwindling fossil oil reserves and growing demand from the energy and materials sectors. Vegetable oils present as likely candidates for conversion into polymeric materials because of their molecular structure. They already contain the long carbon chains that define polymeric materials, as well as carbon to carbon double bonds which can be converted to functional groups through chemical synthesis. For this research locally sourced vegetable oils high in unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid (C 18 : 1), linoleic acid (C 18 : 2) and linolenic acid (C 18 : 3) were epoxidised with peroxyacetic acid formed in situ by the reaction of aqueous hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid in the presence of an acidic ion exchange resin as catalyst. The reaction was carried out in a constantly stirred batch reactor, stirred with a low profile ship’s <b>anchor</b> <b>stirrer.</b> A number of parameters were examined including: (1) the molar ratios of ethylenic unsaturation to acetic acid to hydrogen peroxide, (2) the amount of catalyst loading, (3) the steady state operating temperature of the reactor, (4) the time required to achieve maximum carbon to carbon double bond consumption, (5) the time required to achieve maximum oxirane group formation. Results of epoxidation where examined using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and the titration methods for determining iodine value and oxirane-group oxygen content. Initial testing was conducted on linseed oil, sunflower oil and mutton tallow, but it was decided that locally sourced hemp oil would become the primary focus of this research. This was because hemp oil is high in saturated fatty acids, and there appeared to be little in the existing literature regarding the epoxidation of hemp oil. It was found that optimum processing conditions for hemp oil existed at Molar ratio: Hemp oil (1. 0 mole of double bonds) : Acetic acid (0. 67 moles) : H 2 O 2 (1. 0 moles) Catalyst loading: 15 wt...|$|E
