Extensive oral toxicity data are reviewed, with fewer inhalation toxicity data. Dermal toxicity data are presented that demonstrate, for example, that a mascara with 1. 92 % <b>aminomethyl</b> <b>propanediol</b> {{does not cause}} dermal irritation or allergic contact sensitization, suggesting that the maximum reported use concentration of 2 % in mascara would be safe. Although these ingredients are primary amines that are not substrates for N-nitrosation, they may contain secondary amines as impurities in finished products that may undergo N-nitrosation. These ingredients should not be included in cosmetic formulations containing N-nitrosating agents. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel concludes that aminomethyl propanol and <b>aminomethyl</b> <b>propanediol</b> are safe as cosmetic ingre-dients in the practices of use and concentrations as described in this safety assessment. Keywords aminomethyl propanol, <b>aminomethyl</b> <b>propanediol,</b> cosmetics, safety A safety assessment for aminomethyl propanol (AMP) and <b>aminomethyl</b> <b>propanediol</b> (AMPD) was published by the Cos-metic Ingredient Review (CIR) in 1990. 1 At that time, the CI...|$|E
