25|$|In April 1941, when he {{was five}} years old, the Germans {{attacked}} Belgrade and the Luftwaffe bombed his home. His parents fled with him to Hungary. There, {{when he was}} eight years old they tried to hide him in a monastery for safekeeping, warning him to keep secret {{the fact that he was}} Jewish. He was terrified the entire time that he would be discovered, but says that after that experience he wasn't <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything.</b>|$|E
500|$|Wotton {{had become}} {{something}} of a public speaker, speaking at various venues including presenting the screening of Protected at the Film Fanatics society at Petersham Bowling Club where he spoke of seeing the film as a boy and how it opened his eyes to the way [...] "things were different on Palm". He went on a tour that included Melbourne on 9 August 2008 at the Solidarity Fiesta at the MUA Auditorium he said .... "I'm not <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything,</b> because...people like you will get out there and spread the message, tell the truth." [...] On 10 September 2008 he spoke at a public meeting at the Queensland University of Technology.|$|E
500|$|Hardy himself {{admitted}} {{to his family}} that he was [...] "scared to death" [...] when he first arrived overseas, but believed that the soldiers were fed something to make them brave, which he referred to as [...] "brave pills". After a short time in the military, he claimed {{that he was not}} <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> that he experienced from then on. Even in the heat of battle, Hardy professed that he would get [...] "wound up" [...] at times, but never frightened. He recalled many strange experiences with food and drink, such as getting used to drinking green water from canteens and eating hardtacks, which he found to be surprisingly filling. To go with this, there was often little more than small tins of ham or chicken and occasionally coffee to drink and pudding or pie for dessert. Hardy also witnessed many of his friends get killed in action, and relied on his faith in God to get him through the toughest times.|$|E
60|$|Again Philip {{found nothing}} to say. He was desperately <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> saying <b>anything</b> which she might take for a reproach or a sneer.|$|R
6000|$|Well, Master Fearing, thou didst fear Thy God, and wast <b>afraid</b> <b>Of</b> doing <b>anything,</b> while here, That {{would have}} thee betray'd. And didst thou fear {{the lake and}} pit? Would others did so too! For, as for them that want thy wit, They do {{themselves}} undo.[221] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never," [...] I said. The {{very thought}} {{gave me the}} shivers. The hands seemed fairly fit, all of them, {{and this was the}} time to get them away. Once at sea I was not <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> facing <b>anything.</b> The sea was now the only remedy for all my troubles.|$|R
2500|$|Tantor (Jim Cummings) - [...] "Someone's gonna get hurt, and it's always me!" [...] is Tantor's {{rallying}} cry. Despite {{his size}} and relative stature within the jungle kingdom, Tantor the Elephant is a coward - he is <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> and everything, including bacteria, pond scum, piranhas (which are {{not found in}} Africa), {{and anything else that}} can be named. But when it comes to helping Tarzan in trouble, Tantor shows know-it-all Terk a thing or two in the bravery department and leads the way.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, {{the group}} {{received}} the MTV Legend award by MTV Russia. The {{group is the}} most successful Russian musical export of all time. Katina stated to Billboard Magazine; [...] "People will remember us for great songs, being free, taking life as it is and not being <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything,</b> [...] provocative images of two girls kissing each other, but the second thing was the really great music." [...] In 2006, both Lena and Yulia were awarded [...] "Woman of the Year" [...] by GQ's Person of the Year Awards, but were not awarded under the band name.|$|E
2500|$|Diaz {{is known}} for talking trash to his opponents during fights, competes in triathlons for {{recreation}} and uses his endurance to constantly put pressure on his opponent, as well as pushing {{the pace of the}} fight. Diaz has said, [...] "Fighters are afraid of conditioning, they are afraid of getting tired, but I don’t want to have anxiety or be <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything.</b> I can go 100 percent out there and {{never have to worry about}} getting tired. Everybody says fighting is 90 percent mental, and it's true. Knowing you can go 15 minutes or 25 minutes without any problem can help you sustain that mental advantage over your opponent..." ...|$|E

6000|$|He {{had said}} enough {{to shake the}} {{experience}} of eighteen. He had said enough to give Fanny some happier feelings than she had lately known, and with a brighter look, she answered, [...] "Yes, cousin, I am convinced {{that you would be}} incapable <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> else, though perhaps some might not. I cannot be <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> hearing <b>anything</b> you wish to say. Do not check yourself. Tell me whatever you like." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Becky, it's all done--all {{over but}} the kiss. Don't you be <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> that--it ain't <b>anything</b> at all. Please, Becky." [...] And he tugged at her apron and the hands.|$|R
2500|$|Jackson's {{idea for}} [...] "Black Cat" [...] {{was based on}} a warning to a rebel {{involved}} in substance abuse, in addition to the consequences of drug addiction. Its composition compares the theme to the folklore superstitions of cats having nine lives and black cats foreshadowing a negative omen or misfortune. She also related its title to the bold nature of a panther, saying [...] "I have always felt some kind of connection between myself and a panther. They're not <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything,</b> they're willing to take on anything–that's the way I feel about my work." [...] Regarding its development, she said, [...] "I was getting dressed and ready to go to the studio. The television was on - some commercials and other stuff. I just started humming a melody. I don't know why and it kept sticking in my head. So I put it down on tape." [...] She later recalled Jam & Lewis saying [...] "they thought it was something that might work." [...] Jackson was heavily involved in the song's production, stating: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "All right, Fanny; you needn't be <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> my doing <b>anything</b> awkward or sudden. I'll go to {{her room}} pretty soon, after she is quieted down, and have a good, calm old fatherly {{conversation}} with her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I," [...] he answered, cheerfully, [...] "am <b>afraid</b> {{no longer}} <b>of</b> <b>anything.</b> I {{have become a}} raving optimist. I feel that if the war comes we shall sweep the Turks {{from the face of}} the earth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course she}} does, my dear; nurses always do. But I don't say he roars {{more than other}} children. I only say he roars, and that loudly; so you need not be <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> there being <b>anything</b> the matter with his tongue, or his lungs.|$|R

50|$|The {{story is}} set in the late 1970s and early 1980s, {{in a small town in}} Mainland China. A middle-aged couple has three children. The eldest son is obese and mentally challenged, a social outcast and is {{constantly}} teased by others. The second child, the daughter, is energetic and independent, and isn't <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> doing <b>anything</b> to pursue her dreams or to survive. The youngest child is an introverted, quiet boy who is ashamed of his older brother and tries to break away from his family's misery.|$|R
5000|$|The great {{majority}} of editions labelled Urtext make many more changes than their editors admit. Publishers are partly to blame; they are <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> doing <b>anything</b> that might seem unfamiliar or off-putting to any potential market. Indeed {{they want to have}} the best of both worlds; for example, the Neue Mozart Ausgabe claims to offer an unexceptionable text from the scholarly viewpoint, which at the same time takes the needs of musical practice into account. Whether this is a pious hope or frankly based on self-interest, the fact remains that one cant serve two masters.|$|R
60|$|But now, as before, Mrs. Dove {{would not}} go, and Rachel, {{when she was}} asked, shrugged her {{shoulders}} and answered laughing {{that she was not}} <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> anybody or <b>anything,</b> and, except for her mother's sake, did not care whether she went or stayed. Certainly she would not leave her, nor, she added, did she wish to say goodbye to Africa.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, my dear, {{it may be}} a {{good thing}} for you to have a young lady with you, and if he is to come over, her {{presence}} will explain it.

6000|$|... . As to self-improvement, {{the true}} Catholic mode of {{learning}} is to [...] "prove all things," [...] {{as far as}} we can, without sin or the danger of it, to [...] "hold fast that which is good." [...] Let us never be <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> trying <b>anything</b> new, learnt from people of different opinions to our own. And let us never be <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> changing our opinions. The unwillingness to go back from once declared opinion is a form of pride which haunts some powerful minds: but it is not found in great childlike geniuses. Fools may hold fast to their scanty stock through life, and we must be very cautious in drawing them from it--for where can they supply its place? ...|$|R
60|$|Now all around, behind {{trees and}} stumps, and under thick branches, {{and even in}} tree tops, were other little people {{watching}} with round, wide-open eyes {{to see what would}} happen. It was very exciting, the most exciting thing they could remember. You see, they had come to believe that Farmer Brown's boy wasn't <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> anybody or <b>anything,</b> and as most of them were very much <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> him, they had hard work to believe that he would really be <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> even such a great, big, strong fellow as Buster Bear. Every one was so busy watching Farmer Brown's boy that no one saw Buster coming from the other direction.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Mr. Toad. [...] "He's {{a friend}} of mine." [...] Then Mr. Toad swelled himself up very big. [...] "I'm not <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> under the sun," [...] boasted Mr. Toad.|$|E
60|$|At this taunt I {{flushed and}} gripped {{the shaft of}} my long hunting spear, for among us Northmen {{to be told that}} he was <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> was a deadly insult to a man.|$|E

5000|$|In his memoirs, Puyi, the Last Emperor and Zaifeng's son, {{described}} Wanzhen as {{a fairly}} abusive woman, who terrorised her servants, children and stepchildren alike, {{and noted that}} at least one of her sons died of malnutrition. Empresss Dowager Cixi also recalled that when the Guangxu Emperor was brought to the Forbidden City in 1875 for his coronation, [...] "he was a very sickly child, and could hardly walk, he was so thin and weak. His parents seemed to be <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> giving him <b>anything</b> to eat." ...|$|R
6000|$|Bunter {{was very}} sensitive; {{he left her}} rather brusquely at the last. He got on board in good time, and {{produced}} the usual impression on the mud-pilot in the broken-down straw hat who took the Sapphire out of dock. The river-man was very polite to the dignified, striking-looking chief mate. [...] "The five-inch manilla for the check-rope, Mr.--Bunter, thank you--Mr. Bunter, please." [...] The sea-pilot who left the [...] "gem of ships" [...] heading comfortably down Channel off Dover told {{some of his friends}} that, this voyage, the Sapphire had for chief mate a man who seemed a jolly sight too good for old Johns. [...] "Bunter's his name. I wonder where he's sprung from? Never seen him before in any ship I piloted in or out all these years. He's the sort of man you don't forget. You couldn't. A thorough good sailor, too. And won't old Johns just worry his head off! Unless the old fool should take fright at him--for he does not seem the sort of man that would let himself be put upon without letting you know what he thinks of you. And that's exactly what old Johns would be more <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> than <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> else." ...|$|R
