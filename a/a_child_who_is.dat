25|$|Thompson's {{first film}} success was one he {{directed}} and co-wrote, The Yellow Balloon (1953), {{the story of}} <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> blackmailed into helping a criminal after accidentally causing his friend's death. He followed it with a comedy, For Better, For Worse (1954) starring Dirk Bogarde, which was even more popular though it is little remembered today.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> {{disrupted}} {{is usually}} put first into foster care, pending placement {{with a new}} family, unless they reach the age of 18 and legally become adults before this happens.

25|$|In 2006, {{three percent}} of PGD clinics in the US {{reported}} having selected an embryo {{for the presence of}} a disability. Couples involved were accused of purposely harming a child. This practice is notable in dwarfism, where parents intentionally create <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> a dwarf. In the selection of a saviour sibling to provide a matching bone marrow transplant for an already existing affected child, there are issues including the commodification and welfare of the donor child.|$|E

25|$|The age {{of consent}} in Kansas is 16. K.S.A. 21-5503, 21-5504, 21-5506 and 21-5507 {{prohibit}} sexual activity with minors aged 14 and 15. K.S.A. 21-5507 {{allows for a}} lesser penalty if the minor is 14 or 15 and the offender is under 19 years old. 21-5506 covers indecent liberties with a child and aggravated indecent liberties with a child. Aggravated indecent liberties with a child is sexual intercourse with <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> 14 {{or more years of}} age but less than 16 years of age.|$|E
25|$|Treatment for {{idiopathic}} scoliosis {{also depends}} upon {{the severity of the}} curvature, the spine’s potential for further growth, and the risk that the curvature will progress. Mild scoliosis (less than 30 degrees deviation) may simply be monitored and treated with exercise. Moderately severe scoliosis (30–45 degrees) in <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> still growing may require bracing. Severe curvatures that rapidly progresses may be treated surgically with spinal rod placement. Bracing may prevent a progressive curvature, but evidence for this is not very strong. In all cases, early intervention offers the best results.|$|E
25|$|The {{emphasis}} on the oral qualities of traditional story telling are also evident in this short story. The narrator is telling us about his journey, and his anguish during his delirious night. This narration is full of voices, for example as don Chepe and Niña Tina respond to Cuero de Oro's exhortation. Asturias even ends the tale with the final sentence: and the conversation ended. The textual interplay between Cuero de Oro and don Chepe and Niña Tina can also be interpreted as representative of <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> searching for the roots of his identity, questioning those {{who have access to}} this knowledge of another (mythical) time and space.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} between parental attitudes and a child’s self-concept is crucial during the preschool years. It {{has been reported}} that elevated stress levels in mothers correlated with reduced social skills in their children. Strong parent support networks may help to prevent the development of negative self-concept in children with cleft palate. In the later preschool and early elementary years, the development of social skills is no longer only impacted by parental attitudes but is beginning to be shaped by their peers. A cleft lip or cleft palate may affect the behavior of preschoolers. Experts suggest that parents discuss with their children ways to handle negative social situations related to their cleft lip or cleft palate. <b>A</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> entering school should learn the proper (and age-appropriate) terms related to the cleft. The ability to confidently explain the condition to others may limit feelings of awkwardness and embarrassment and reduce negative social experiences.|$|E
25|$|Once a {{potential}} victim {{has come into}} contact with state authorities, identifying the child as a victim of trafficking takes time. The process often benefits from a thorough understanding of the child’s story. For <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> in trouble with the law, hearing the child's full story helps caseworkers and officers determine if the child is actually a victim of a crime herself, such as exploitation, abuse, or trafficking. For a child in an administrative process, such as an asylum procedure, hearing the child's full story helps caseworkers to detect cases of trafficking. Children may be hesitant to share their complete stories with authorities and appointed child welfare professionals. Some service providers have found that establishing trust and a stable relationship with the child encourages increased disclosure of experiences of exploitation and trafficking that might otherwise not be detected. The trust building process can include granting assistance and support services to ensure safety, well-being and development.|$|E
25|$|Charlotte Corday {{arrives in}} Paris at dawn. In a square she meets Camille, her {{childhood}} friend, now a deputy to the National Convention. He is disappointed, defeated, and fears for his life. Amongst {{the crowd is}} Gaston, who tells Charlotte {{that he is the}} bodyguard and faithful friend of Marat. Their conversation is interrupted by a commotion which arises around a bakery. In play, a group of children act out the events of the Revolution. The square slowly empties out, except for <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> left behind by his playmates, tied up as a victim. Charlotte releases and comforts him, thereby building up courage herself, then she buys a long-bladed knife and a shawl from a pedlar. Marat arrives surrounded by an adulating crowd which, at the same time, notices his fatigue and ill-health. Charlotte attracts his attention for a moment, then he continues on to the hall of the Convention. She does not know how {{to take advantage of the}} situation to kill him. Marat, received by the deputies with a mixture of hostility and respect, addresses the assembly.|$|E

500|$|Dave Wallace of Comics Bulletin, however, cited that [...] "Pride & Joy" [...] felt [...] "pedestrian {{and lacking}} in depth." [...] Wallace also called {{colouring}} of the early issues flat and static, which made it fairly uninteresting. Despite Molly often being considered a fan-favorite character, the character is nevertheless criticized for being portrayed [...] "far younger than <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> about to hit puberty," [...] and is compared to acting more {{along the lines of}} a six- or seven-year-old as opposed to eleven. Similarly, the character is always considered being [...] "naive." ...|$|E

Back in Shepherd's Glen, Alex allies himself with Deputy Wheeler in the police department. Alex eventually learns {{that his father was}} involved in the secrets of the town and had left to attempt to resolve the town's problems, but before he is able to get answers from his mother at home, he is knocked unconscious when The Order—a religious cult from Silent Hill which has been taking people from the town— kidnaps his mother.|$|E

500|$|The {{songs on}} the album tackle {{personal}} {{as well as social}} and political concerns. Vedder said that [...] "you write what comes to you... You try to reflect the mood of the songs." [...] Topics on the album include child abuse ("Daughter"), gun culture ("Glorified G"), police racism ("W.M.A."), and the media ("Blood"). [...] "Daughter", [...] "Dissident", and [...] "Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town" [...] are three storytelling songs. [...] "Daughter" [...] tells the story of <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> abused by her parents because they do not understand her learning disability; [...] "Dissident" [...] {{tells the story of a}} woman who takes in a political fugitive; and [...] "Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town" [...] tells the story of an old lady who has been stuck in a small town her whole life.|$|E
500|$|Steve Giergerich of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch {{felt that}} Sarah and Little Bee are both [...] "so richly drawn that the {{supporting}} characters suffer by comparison." [...] These supporting characters are Andrew, Sarah's husband, Lawrence, her lover, Clarissa her colleague and Charlie, her four-year-old son, who {{for much of}} the novel answers only to [...] "Batman" [...] and dresses only in his Batman costume. Sarah Liss of CBC News deemed Andrew and Lawrence the two least-likeable characters in the novel, describing Andrew as [...] "an ordinary guy with self-righteous beliefs who comes up slightly short when he's tested by real life" [...] and Lawrence as a [...] "cowardly yes-man". Cleave agreed that for Lawrence, [...] "career and propriety are more important than basic morality. He's gone so far down that road that he can't come back, and he's made more villainous for all the things he could do but doesn't." [...] Charlie is based on Cleave's oldest son, who similarly spent six months aged four answering only to [...] "Batman". He forms the emotional centre of the novel, holding the adult characters together, and is a study in the early formation of identity. Cleave explained: [...] "Little Bee is a novel about where our individuality lies – which layers of identity are us, and which are mere camouflage. So it's a deliberate choice to use the metaphor of <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> engaging in his first experiments with identity – in Charlie's case by taking on the persona of a superhero." ...|$|E
