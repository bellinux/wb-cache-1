5000|$|William Hung {{was offered}} a $25,000 advance on a record deal from Koch Entertainment in 2004, and {{released}} three albums on that label in 2004 and 2005. His first album was titled Inspiration and was produced by Giuseppe D. It was recorded over a March 2004 weekend with <b>Hung</b> <b>singing</b> vocals over karaoke music. To promote it, Hung performed before nearly 20,000 fans during half-time at a Golden State Warriors game on April 6 and performed [...] "She Bangs", included on the album, on such shows as The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. The album received highly negative reviews, but ultimately went on to sell about 200,000 copies and reached Number One on Billboard's Top Independent Album Chart. His two follow-up albums were far less successful, as Hung for the Holidays (a Christmas album) only sold 35,000 copies, despite a national promotion campaign including appearances on The Howard Stern Show, and Miracle: Happy Summer from William Hung (another karaoke cover album) only sold 7,000. In a February 2006 interview, {{he said he was}} working on a 5 or 6-track fourth album, though with his retirement in 2011, it is not likely such an album will ever be released.|$|R

I agreed - Ali took it very seriously and actually got me here to record the song. It's basically musicians bonding with each other. One song can make you friends for life - that is the power of music," [...] sharing her experience she stated, [...] " [...] It Pakistan is a place where all the musicians are in an environment where they have their instruments, their space and the freedom to choose anything and convey it to the people in their own style; it's very powerful." [...] Atif Aslam announced that he would not return to season 9.|$|R
50|$|There {{was a lot}} of {{controversy}} when Quang Lê’s name was taken off of the Paris By Night 96 Nhạc Yêu Cầu 2 poster, much to the dismay of many of his fans. Thúy Nga was swarmed with mails, calls and even return of tickets for the show. Speculations that Quang Lê’s contract was over with Thúy Nga and that he would be joining Trung Tam Asia began to circulate. Many fans were not happy to hear this rumour. Quang Lê did not appear in the Paris by Night 96 show but made a surprise appearance in Paris By Night 97 <b>singing</b> “Huế <b>Mù</b> Sương”. This ended any rumours of Quang Lê leaving Thúy Nga and put many hearts at ease. For the DVD release of Paris by Night 96, Thúy Nga included an MTV of Quang Lê singing “Đôi Mắt Người Xưa”. Fans got to see a very romantic side of Quang Lê as he cried in the video to his ex-love on her wedding day (just all an act of course). The video also provided a promotional ad to Quang Lê’s new album with Mai Thiên Vân.|$|R
60|$|Oliver rose next morning, {{in better}} heart, and went about his usual occupations, with more hope and {{pleasure}} {{than he had}} known for many days. The birds were once more <b>hung</b> out, to <b>sing,</b> in their old places; and the sweetest wild flowers that could be found, were once more gathered to gladden Rose with their beauty. The melancholy which had seemed to the sad eyes of the anxious boy to hang, for days past, over every object, beautiful as all were, was dispelled by magic. The dew seemed to sparkle more brightly on the green leaves; the air to rustle among them with a sweeter music; and the sky itself to look more blue and bright. Such is the influence which the condition of our own thoughts, exercise, even over the appearance of external objects. Men who look on nature, and their fellow-men, and cry that all is dark and gloomy, are in the right; but the sombre colours are reflections from their own jaundiced eyes and hearts. The real hues are delicate, and need a clearer vision.|$|R
60|$|O, {{it was a}} fine {{thing to}} see the vigor and {{discipline}} with which he managed the business; so that if, on a hot, drowsy Sunday, any part of the choir <b>hung</b> back or <b>sung</b> sleepily on the first part of a verse, they were obliged to bestir themselves in good earnest, and sing three times as fast, in order to get through with the others. 'Kiah Morse was no advocate for your dozy, drawling singing, that one may do at leisure, between sleeping and waking, I assure you; indeed, he got entirely out of the graces of Deacon Dundas and one or two other portly, leisurely old gentlemen below, who had been used to throw back their heads, shut up their eyes, and take the comfort of the psalm, by prolonging indefinitely all the notes. The first Sunday after 'Kiah took the music in hand, the old deacon really rubbed his eyes and looked about him; for the psalm was sung off before he was ready to get his mouth opened, and he really looked upon it as a most irreverent piece of business.|$|R
