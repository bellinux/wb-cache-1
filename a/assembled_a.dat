5|$|After {{performing}} {{in a number}} of heavy metal bands in high school, Townsend was discovered by a record label in 1993 and was asked to perform lead vocals on Steve Vai's album Sex & Religion.

In order to secure food supplies, France turned to its American colonies and the United States, which <b>assembled</b> <b>a</b> large grain convoy in Hampton Roads. To ensure the security of this convoy, the French Navy dispatched most of its Atlantic Fleet to sea during May 1794, operating in a series of large squadrons, independent cruisers and one major fleet under Villaret de Joyeuse. On 5 May, two French ships operating independently, the 36-gun frigate Atalante under Captain Charles Linois and the corvette Levrette, spied a British convoy sailing south-west, three days out from Cork, and closed to investigate.|$|E
5|$|Byrne <b>assembled</b> <b>a</b> band to {{tour for}} the album, {{performing}} music throughout {{the latter half}} of 2008 and early 2009 across NorthAmerica, Europe, and Australasia. He hired more singers than he had on previous tours to reproduce the complex vocal harmonies of the album and was inspired to bring along dancers after seeing SufjanStevens promote the album Illinois as well as the Japanese films FunkyForest and TheTasteofTea. Byrne was initially uninvolved in the choreography, but made more suggestions as the tour went on and after he saw a live performance by Deerhoof that incorporated dancing with instruments. He began booking tour dates before the album was completed and continued writing his book TheBicycleDiaries throughout the tour.|$|E
