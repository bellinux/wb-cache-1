Methods: olfactory function were studied in 10 participants with ASD (mean age 19. 3 ± 2 years, 8 boys) and 10 controls (mean age 22 ± 2 years, 8 boys). We tested olfactory threshold, identification and discrimination with the Sniffin’ Sticks test. Participants with ASD had an IQ mean 103. 2 ± 18. 5.

40|$|Halogenated phenols and cresols {{belong to}} a group of {{volatiles}} consistently reported as off-flavour compounds. For example, 2 -iodophenol and 2 -iodo- 4 -methylphenol with their typical medicinal smell were found to negatively affect bottled mineral water. Even though these compounds are widespread in nature no comprehensive information about their chemo-analytical as well as odour properties is available. Therefore, the objective of this study were (1) to provide systematic chemo-analytical data on these substances, such as mass spectral data and retention parameters in gas chromatographic analysis, and (2) to determine, on a direct comparative basis, the sensory properties of eight mono-halogenated phenols, four di-halogenated phenols and four halogenated cresols. Evaluations focused on the determination of odour quality and <b>odour</b> <b>threshold</b> concentration in <b>air</b> and water. With regard to the relationship between substitution pattern and odour character, the location of an iodine atom in the ortho-position was demonstrated to obviously be an important prerequisite for medicinal, plaster-like or ink-like smell. Faecal or horse stable-like odour notes were predominantly related to compounds being substituted either by halogen moieties or by a methyl group in the para-position. The 2 -halogenated 4 -methylphenols were found to be the odorants with the lowest <b>odour</b> <b>threshold</b> concentrations of all the compounds investigated in this study, and that, generally, compounds with ortho-halogenation exhibited exceptionally low <b>odour</b> <b>threshold</b> concentrations...|$|R

Statistical analysis was further able to identify those flavour compounds that most discriminate between Apo and IR 64. Samples of IR 64 from the irrigated treatment formed a distinct cluster in the first axis, with indole as the compound most strongly correlated with that dimension (Table  2). Indole has a sweet flavour and is used at low concentrations to form synthetic sweet floral aromas (Jezussek et al. 2002), so it is a promising candidate for the sweeter taste perceived in the grains of IR 64 from the irrigated treatment, and in agreement with previous reports for rice grown in France (Maraval et al. 2008).|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of three manure pit additives in commercial scale manure channels and simulated outdoor storage. The additives were American BioCatalysts (ABC), Pit Boss (PB) and Westbridge (WB). Results from two sets of indoor trials were combined to provide eight replicates of each additive. The protocol consisted of manure accumulation, pretreatment and treatment. Air and slurry samples were taken on Days 28 and 35 of the treatment phase. The outdoor phase that followed determined if residual effects resulting from indoor treatment existed. Manure was transferred from the manure channels to outdoor storage lagoons where it was stored in simulated lagoons. Samples were taken on Days 49 and 63. In terms of <b>odour</b> <b>threshold</b> reduction, the additives' effectiveness varied from producing no reduction to reductions of 66 %. The 66 % reduction produced by PB in the outdoor trial was the only significant <b>odour</b> <b>threshold</b> reduction in the experiment. During indoor storage, the additives produced minor <b>odour</b> <b>threshold</b> reductions. The additives were able to promote H 2 S reductions of 14 to 76 % and consistent yet minor NH 3 reductions in the indoor trials. None of the additives produced practical reductions in Total Solids or solubilization that could have improved manure-handling ease. Perhaps the strongest attribute of all of the additives was the ability to maintain elevated nutrients and micronutrient levels. Higher levels of TKN were maintained by all of the additives and the ability of the additives to maintain nitrogen in the available form, especially on Day 35 representing a potential of 9 to 25 % more available nitrogen during field application. Likewise, the additives resulted in 4 to 23 % more P while promoting elevated ortho-phosphate levels during the indoor trial. Improvements in nutrient value were also observed in potassium, copper and zinc results. Only with respect to waste strength reduction was the effectiveness of the additives relatively poor. In order to make more progress in the field of manure pit treatment, research must be directed towards understanding the modes of action of manure pit additives. With this information, optimization of their performance would lead to better results. Note:Page 81 is missing...|$|R

In this study, we investigated whether the human olfactory bulb volume increases with increasing olfactory function due to treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis. Nineteen patients with chronic rhinosinusitis were investigated before and after treatment. For comparison, additional measurements were performed in 18 healthy volunteers. Volumetric measurements of the olfactory bulb were based on planimetric manual contouring of magnetic resonance scans. Olfactory function was evaluated separately for each nostril using tests for <b>odour</b> <b>threshold,</b> <b>odour</b> discrimination and odour identification. Measurements were performed on two occasions, 3 months apart. In healthy controls, the olfactory bulb volume did not change significantly between the two measurements. In contrast, the olfactory bulb volume in patients increased significantly from the initial 64. 5 +/- 3. 2 to 70. 0 +/- 3. 5 mm(3) on the left side (P = 0. 02) and from 60. 9 +/- 3. 5 to 72. 4 +/- 2. 8 mm(3) on the right side (P < 0. 001).

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the levels of odour generated during the application of several common herbicides, the level of exposure of the general public when the odours are detected, and the potential risk of adverse health effects resulting from that exposure. In addition, the hypothesis that the majority of the odour associated with many agrichemicals is due to manufacturing impurities and/or additives in the commercial formulations was tested. Commercial formulations of 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic (2, 4 -D) acid in the form of the butyl ester (2, 4 -D butyl ester), ethylhexyl ester (2, 4 -D ethylhexyl ester) and triethanolamine salt (2, 4 -D amine) were studied because of current concerns regarding their use. A common alternative, 4 -methyl- 2 -chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) was also studied. A commercial formulation of 2, 4 -D ethylhexyl ester was used to test the hypothesis that the majority of the odour associated with many agrichemicals is due to manufacturing impurities and/or additives. Using dynamic dilution olfactometry, pure 2, 4 -D ethylhexyl ester was determined to be odourless. 2, 4 -dichlorophenol, which has an intense odour, was identified as a manufacturing impurity in the formulation. An estimate of its <b>odour</b> <b>threshold</b> (1. 95 ppb) was measured using the technique of dynamic dilution olfactometry. Other significant odorants in the formulation were iso-octanol and an aromatic solvent. The aromatic solvent is responsible for the majority of the odour associated with the 2, 4 -D ethylhexyl ester formulation, assuming no significant masking or synergistic effects between the odorants. The odour concentrations generated from the spraying of the herbicides under simulated aerial application conditions were measured using dynamic dilution olfactometry. The mean odour concentrations for 2, 4 -D ethylhexyl ester (22, 350 OUc/m³) and MCPA (23, 400 OUc/m³) were about 2 -fold higher than the values for 2, 4 -D butyl ester (12, 070 OUc/m³) and 2, 4 -D amine (10, 000 OUc/m³). Chemical analysis of the odours determined that the calculated level of airborne active ingredient when the odour of each herbicide was "just detectable" (the <b>odour</b> <b>threshold)</b> were all lower than 0. 2 µg/m³. The calculated odour safety factor between the concentration of active ingredient at the <b>odour</b> <b>threshold</b> for each herbicide and its Threshold Limit Value - Time Weighted Average were all high and of a similar magnitude, ranging from 58, 100 for 2, 4 -D butyl ester to 80, 600 for MCPA. It was concluded that detection of faint or even strong odours from the herbicides as a result of spray drift will not result in exposures of toxicological significance to members of the public. kilometres. The detection of the odour alerts people to the presence of chemicals in the air, and in many cases those affected think that they are being exposed to harmful levels of the active ingredient of the spray.

Commercial formulations of 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic (2, 4 -D) acid in the form of the butyl ester (2, 4 -D butyl ester), ethylhexyl ester (2, 4 -D ethylhexyl ester) and triethanolamine salt (2, 4 -D amine) were studied because of current concerns regarding their use. A common alternative, 4 -methyl- 2 -chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) was also studied. A commercial formulation of 2, 4 -D ethylhexyl ester was used to test the hypothesis that the majority of the odour associated with many agrichemicals is due to manufacturing impurities and/or additives. Using dynamic dilution olfactometry, pure 2, 4 -D ethylhexyl ester was determined to be odourless. 2, 4 -dichlorophenol, which has an intense odour, was identified as a manufacturing impurity in the formulation. An estimate of its <b>odour</b> <b>threshold</b> (1. 95 ppb) was measured using the technique of dynamic dilution olfactometry. Other significant odorants in the formulation were iso-octanol and an aromatic solvent. The aromatic solvent is responsible for the majority of the odour associated with the 2, 4 -D ethylhexyl ester formulation, assuming no significant masking or synergistic effects between the odorants. The odour concentrations generated from the spraying of the herbicides under simulated aerial application conditions were measured using dynamic dilution olfactometry. The mean odour concentrations for 2, 4 -D ethylhexyl ester (22, 350 OUc/m 3) and MCPA (23, 400 OUc/m 3) were about 2 -fold higher than the values for 2, 4 -D butyl ester (12, 070 OUc/m 3) and 2, 4 -D amine (10, 000 OUc/m 3). Chemical analysis of the odours determined that the calculated level of airborne active ingredient when the odour of each herbicide was "just detectable" (the <b>odour</b> <b>threshold)</b> were all lower than 0. 2 µg/m 3. The calculated odour safety factor between the concentration of active ingredient at the <b>odour</b> <b>threshold</b> for each herbicide and its Threshold Limit Value - Time Weighted Average were all high and of a similar magnitude, ranging from 58, 100 for 2, 4 -D butyl ester to 80, 600 for MCPA. It was concluded that detection of faint or even strong odours from the herbicides as a result of spray drift will not result in exposures of toxicological significance to members of the public...|$|R
40|$|Olfactory {{abilities}} show a {{high degree}} of inter-individual variability and this could be partly related to personality differences. Here, in two studies, we tested a potential link between personality dimensions and olfactory perception. Sixty-eight (study 1) and a hundred and fifty-six (study 2) young adults completed the Big Five questionnaire and performed the Sniffin' Sticks test for assessing <b>odour</b> <b>threshold,</b> identification, and (in study 2) discrimination. In neither study did we find a significant link between personality dimensions and olfactory identification scores. However, in study 1, we found a significant positive correlation between the neuroticism dimension and olfactory sensitivity. This was mainly due to the anxiety and self-consciousness subscales, which load onto the neuroticism dimension. In a follow-up study, we again found a significant association between anxiety and odour perception, specifically in odour discrimination. Our results indicate that variability in anxiety could partly explain the high inter-individual variation in olfactory perception...|$|R
40|$|Greco grape (Vitis vinifera L.), {{a typical}} white variety of Campania {{region in the}} South of Italy, was {{investigated}} {{for the first time}} determining volatile-free and glycosidically bound secondary metabolites that could be {{at the base of the}} aroma profile of DOCG ‘Greco di Tufo’ wines. C 18 reversed-phase isolates of ‘Greco’ musts have been investigated by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. ‘Greco’ must resulted characterised by a content of glycoconjugated terpenoids ranging from 180 to 370 lg L 1. Linalool and geraniol detected in the ‘Greco’ must above their <b>odour</b> <b>thresholds</b> could explain a floral character attributed to the wine. Guaiacol in free fraction, 4 -vinylguaiacol and eugenol in the bound fraction could be at the origin of nutty and spicy notes of the wine. Some observations of this study also show that precursors of floral, spicy and nutty odorants seem to be enhanced by clay soil and good sun exposure...|$|R
40|$|Four Pinot noir {{wines from}} Burgundy were {{investigated}} by gas chromatography-olfactometry, {{with regard to}} the presence of earthy-smelling compounds. 2 -Methylisoborneol (2 -MIB) was detected in two of these wines, although the samples were seven years old, contradicting previous reports that this substance is unstable in wine and must. In order to investigate this seemingly paradoxical situation, 2 -MIB stability was reinvestigated in wine and in model solution starting with an elevated initial concentration. Although 2 -MIB concentration greatly decreased during the 90 days of storage, the final concentration measured in both media was well above the <b>odour</b> <b>threshold</b> of the substance. Based on the observation of a decelerating decrease of 2 -MIB with time, it was concluded that this substance can still be detected in wine and can induce, in this case, an earthy off-odour on condition that the start concentration is high enough...|$|R
