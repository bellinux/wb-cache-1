40|$|AbstractAbrasive flow {{machining}} (AFM) is {{a precision}} finishing process with a deforming tool. In this process, a semi viscous carrier material {{that holds the}} abrasive particles acts as a multi-point flexible tool with tiny cutting edges. In the present study, effects of few important parameters such as extrusion pressure, <b>abrasive</b> <b>mesh</b> size, processing time and media flow rate on finishing EN- 8 steel bevel gears have been investigated. A new tooling for fixing bevel gears has been designed and developed {{in such a way}} that the abrasive media passage is thoroughly restricted to abrade the gear tooth surface only. The initial surface roughness of the as received bevel gears was 1. 4 to 1. 8 micrometers. Taguchi orthogonal array was used to investigate the signal to noise ratio, main effect and parametric optimization. Finished gears were monitored using an optical profiler to assess the surface roughness. Finished gear surfaces were subjected to roughness measurements at five different locations (for each sample) and average of those values was considered. The results indicated that the improvement in surface finish was more than 50 %, however, the enhancement in material removal was marginal. It was observed that the extrusion pressure has the highest contribution of about 73 % on the process output; the other significant parameters being <b>abrasive</b> <b>mesh</b> size and processing time...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{potential}} of abrasive waterjet technology was investigated {{as a method}} to polish Z-blocks of synthetic quartz crystals. The polished surfaces were characterized by surface roughometer and scanning electron microscopy. The main factors affecting the surface roughness and the erosion mechanisms related to material removal were analysed. It is found that <b>abrasive</b> <b>mesh,</b> water pressure and jet incidence angle are the main factors affecting the surface roughness. By contrast, the influence of traverse speed on the surface roughness is small. Under certain controlled conditions, the erosion mechanisms of synthetic quartz crystals are plastic flow, leaving a crack-free surface by low-middle pressure micro abrasive waterjet...|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} common and {{versatile}} is the foam pig which is cut or poured out of an open cell polyurethane foam into the shape of a bullet and is driven through pipelines for many reasons like to prove the inner diameter of the line, clean it, de water it, or dry it out. There are several types of pigs for cleaning in various densities from 2lb to 10lb foam and in special applications up to 20lb. Some have tungsten studs or <b>abrasive</b> wire <b>mesh</b> on the outside to cut rust, scale, or paraffin wax deposits off the inside of the pipe. Other types are fully or criss-cross coated in urethane, or there are bare polyurethane foam pigs with a urethane coating just on the rear to seal and assist in driving the pig. There are also fully molded urethane pigs which are great for liquid removal or batching several different products in one line.|$|R

Al/SiCp-MMC’s {{find their}} use in {{engineering}} and structural components but their machining particularly finishing is a challenge for manufacturing engineers due to their heterogonous nature having abrasive particles randomly distributed and oriented in the matrix material.

40|$|Planar ground {{float glass}} {{surfaces}} and the surfaces within holes are polished using fluid jet polishing (FJP) {{in order to}} improve their visual appearance or material strength. The large flexibility of FJP makes it suitable for polishing holes and other complex geometries.

The effects of leading FBM operational parameters, namely, abrasive size, jet pressure and processing time, were evaluated by using a full factorial Design Of Experiments. Machinability of APS APS-TiO 2 coatings {{was found to be}} highly dependent on jet pressure and on <b>abrasive</b> <b>mesh</b> size as they affect the contact conditions between the abrasive and machined surface as well as the finishing force. By modifying these conditions, FR-FBM allows 3 to 4 -fold improvements in roughness parameters of as-deposited APS APS-TiO 2 coatings and imparts minimal defects or alterations to the machined surface, whilst maintaining its ability to guarantee the respect of the closest geometrical tolerances. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|This {{research}} proposes an optimized magnetic abrasive {{machining process}} that uses an ultra-high-speed system to perform precision machining on a workpiece. The system can process several microns of material, either for machining surface roughness or for machining a workpiece for a precise micro-diameter. The stainless steel workpieces have been machined using an ultra-high-speed magnetic abrasive machining (UHSMAM) process. The experiments were performed analyzing {{the accuracy of}} the machined workpiece diameter, using response surface methodology. The results obtained after machining have been analyzed to determine the effect of different process parameters such as machining speed, machining time, machining frequencies, inert gas in/out, magnetic pole types, and magnetic <b>abrasive</b> <b>mesh</b> size for the individual workpiece, as well as to study various interaction effects that may significantly affect the machining performance of the process. The obtained outcomes of the analysis for different workpieces have been critically compared to understand the effect of the considered process parameters based on the resulting mechanical properties.

40|$|Abstract: Preparation {{of cutting}} tool edge using micro {{abrasive}} water jet is proposed in this paper. A specific designed water jet machine tool with four axes was developed. Also {{a specially designed}} abrasive nozzle assembly for preparation of cutting tool edge has designed. The inside diameter of orifice is φ 125 µm. The abrasive nozzle has three sections, i. e. the contraction section, the cylinder section and the diffusion section. The diffusion section has a quasi rectangular profile. Experiments on preparation of coated inserts of cutting tool using micro abrasive water jet have been carried out. The silicon carbide solid <b>abrasive</b> with 400 <b>meshes</b> was used during the experiment. The {{results show that the}} sharp edge was rounded by micro abrasive water jet. A honed edge with very small radius exists and irregular zigzag edge was disappeared after preparation. Experiments also show that the linear waviness on the surface was eliminated completely by preparation process. The surface roughness of the coated inserts increased to Ra 0. 526 µm from Ra 0. 025 µm after preparation. It demonstrates that the tool edge strength could be enhanced and the micro defects could be eliminated during this course. It proved that preparation of cutting tool edge by micro abrasive water jet is feasible and practical.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{internal}} finishing of tubular components made from a high strength aluminium alloy (AA 6082 T 6) using a fluidized bed assisted abrasive jet machining (FB-AJM) system. Firstly, a Taguchi's experimental plan was used to investigate the influence of abrasive jet speed, machining cycle, and <b>abrasive</b> <b>mesh</b> size on surface roughness and material removal trends. Secondly, the leading finishing mechanisms were studied using combined 3 d profilometer-SEM analysis to monitor {{the evolution of the}} surface morphology of machined workpieces. Finally, the circumferential uniformity and precision machining of the inner surface of workpieces were tested by evaluating the values of the more significant roughness parameters in different circumferential locations. Consistent trends of surface roughness vs. operational parameters were measured, and significant material removal was found to affect the workpieces during machining. As a result, FB-AJM was found to preferentially machine the asperities and irregularities of the surface, thereby altering the overall surface morphology producing more regular and smoother finishing. Moreover, the good circumferential uniformity and machining accuracy FB-AJM guarantees even on ductile aluminium alloy workpieces ensure that this technology can be applied to a diverse set of industrial components.
