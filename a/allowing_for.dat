3000|$|... iTo our knowledge, {{statistical}} software that can combine the analyses of plausible values as outcomes with a cross-classified multilevel design does not exist. STATA Stata Corp uses Gauss-Hermite quadrature and <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> modeling cross-classified effects {{up to two}} levels. However, the ado macro that <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> analyzing plausible values (pv.ado) can work only with statistical packages that <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> using weights. The stata packages designed to analyse cross-classified data structures (xtmixed and gllamm) do not work with plausible values. SPSS-macro’s for plausible values are not designed for analyzing data in a cross-classified design. Specialized multilevel software packages are also limited in this extent. The newest version of MlWin (which we use in this paper) <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> estimating cross-classified models, but cannot deal with plausible values. Two-level cross-classified random-effect models have also been implemented in HLM. In principle, the HLM 7 software <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> analyzing both plausible values as outcomes and cross-classified models. However, the HLM packages that <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> cross-classified analyses (i.e. HCM 2 and HCM 3) do not <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> using plausible values as outcome variables.|$|R
