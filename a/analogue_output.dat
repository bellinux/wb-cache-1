50|$|The MT-32 and {{compatible}} modules use {{a parallel}} 16-bit DAC at a sampling rate of 32000 Hz. In {{order to improve}} the signal-to-noise ratio without investing in higher-quality components, {{the volume of the}} digital signal fed into the DAC is doubled by shifting all 15 non-sign-carrying data bits to the left, which amounts to multiplying the amplitude by two while keeping the noise floor constant at the <b>analogue</b> <b>output.</b>|$|E
50|$|Premiere, {{after several}} delays, started {{broadcasting}} three HD channels — one each dedicated to films, sports and documentaries — in November 2005, {{although there were}} virtually no suitable, certified receivers available on the market. The content was also sparse and thus often repeated. Sky (formerly Premiere) reuses its proprietary digital rights management system embedded into its content scrambling system (Nagravision) from SD broadcasts to block <b>analogue</b> <b>output</b> of the movie channel from the receiving set-top box altogether, only allowing HDCP-secured transmissions; the other channels are less restricted.|$|E

50|$|To prevent {{digital signal}} {{overflow}} and its audible result, the digital output volume {{must be kept}} low enough so that bit 14 will never be used. On the first generation MT-32, this can simply be done by selecting a lower main volume on the unit's front panel, which directly controls the software main volume setting, which in turn directly translates into the amplitude of the digital output signal. On later generation units, this does not work, as the main volume knob and the software main volume setting only modify {{the volume of the}} <b>analogue</b> <b>output</b> using voltage-controlled amplifiers and have little effect on the amplitude of the digital signal. To prevent signal overflow, each individual part's volume (controller #7) must be kept low instead.|$|E
50|$|The term {{oversampling}} is {{also used}} to denote a process used in the reconstruction phase of digital-to-analog conversion, in which an intermediate high sampling rate is used between the digital input and the <b>analogue</b> <b>output.</b> Here, samples are interpolated in the digital domain to add additional samples in between, thereby converting the data to a higher sample rate, which is a form of upsampling. When the resulting higher-rate samples are converted to analog, a less complex/expensive analog low pass filter is required to remove the high-frequency content, which will consist of reflected images of the real signal created by the zero-order hold of the digital-to-analog converter. Essentially, {{this is a way to}} shift some of the complexity of the filtering into the digital domain and achieves the same benefit as oversampling in analog-to-digital conversion.|$|E
5000|$|The {{event was}} {{significant}} {{due to the}} amateur ASRA event organiser putting on a World Championship event. The then President of ASRA Hagbath Strom resigned from his fulltime job and spent 6 months organsing the event. ASRA Vice President David Robinson and James Hopkin worked {{out of the first}} premises of Hopkin Skate on creating a way to film and broadcast the racing on Mt Panorama. There had been other downhill racing events that filmed and broadcast the racing, Newtons Playground was the first IGSA World Championship to be filmed from top to bottom and the racing was broadcast onto screens on the mountain. The technique was using the <b>analogue</b> <b>output</b> of a digital camera and sending the signal up a cat5 cable, using boosters to increase the signal, receiving the four video streams in a mixing desk in Castrol Tower, at the top of Mt Panorama, output to video screens and also capturing the feed to later upload online. It was the first time skaters from around the work watched racing within the day of it happening online.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-Induction motors are {{the most}} {{extensively}} used motors in most power-driven home appliances, agricultural and industrial applications. Simple and rugged design, low cost, low maintenance and direct connection to an AC power source are the chief advantages of an AC induction motor. Many applications need variable speed operation {{and one of them}} is a simple fan load. The DTMF generator which generates the <b>analogue</b> <b>output</b> signal for the corresponding button pressed using key pad. This <b>analogue</b> <b>output</b> is fed to the FM Transmitter and sent through the antenna. At the other end, the FM Receiver picks up the signal and feeds it to the signal decoder, there the decoding takes place and this decoding data is given to the PIC Micro controller. The software in the PIC receives the signal and accordingly drives the SCR Circuit, which in turn is connected to load serially. Simulation of DTMF is carried out using SIMULINK and in the experimental work a prototype model is built through the PIC microcontroller (PIC 16 F 873) which is used to generate the PWM pulses for speed control of the motor.

40|$|A {{new concept}} for the {{acquisition}} of point receiver towed streamer data is introduced. Recording of point receiver data, rather than the <b>analogue</b> <b>outputs</b> of hardwired arrays, enables both dynamic group forming and enhanced attenuation of noise. Dynamic group forming allows better signal preservation and enhanced frequency recovery, particularly at far offsets. Data adaptive noise attenuation methods allows improved attenuation of the low frequency noise induced by water flow around the streamer, enabling the enhancement of the low frequency signal-to-noise ratio through avoidance of low cut filters. Point receiver marine seismic data will improve the dynamic range of the seismic signal and enhance the viability of time-lapse monitoring of reservoirs with towed streamer data...|$|R

40|$|The {{project to}} design a CD {{transport}} (CD player) in conjunction with Perreaux Industries came about from {{the need for a}} source component in their Silhouette series of products. This project describes the design a high quality CD player, at a low price, to compliment Perreaux's Silhouette series. A CD drive is selected over a proprietary optical pickup due to the former's low cost and the standardisation of the interface. The control circuitry includes a micro controller and discrete logic to provide the correct data and clock signals to the SPDIF transmitter and DAC circuits. These two circuits provided a high quality <b>analogue</b> <b>output,</b> and facilitate an upgrade path by connecting the SPDIF output to an external DAC. After three board iterations, a final production ready revision was achieved. The design includes a high quality toroidal transformer, low jitter crystal oscillator, and a very high quality SPDIF pulse transformer output. The design also allows a remote input to control the player, and an optional digital cable via an RJ 45 connector to provide synchronisation with a future design of the SXD 2 DAC module, or to transmit SPDIF to a remote location. The specifications of the final design were higher than expectations. The digital output boasts equal or superior performance to competitive products in the same price range, with the <b>analogue</b> <b>output</b> attaining exceptionally high performance...|$|E

30|$|The time {{resolution}} (FWHM) of 550  ps {{of this system}} (including constant fraction discriminators (CFDs)) was determined using the TDC setup of the Multiparameter Data Acquisition System MPA- 3 together with a Dual Timing ADC 7072 T (both by FAST ComTec, Oberhaching, Germany). Two reasons are mainly responsible for that: variations of the PMT transit time and different rise times of the analogue input signal at the CFD. However, these different rise times can be compensated partly by using the constant fraction technology. For these PMTs <b>analogue</b> <b>output</b> signals, a fraction of 0.2 and an external delay of 4  ns were chosen as ideal settings at the CFDs to optimise the timing resolution.|$|E

40|$|A {{fundamental}} problem in digitally controlled class-D power amplifiers is the {{distortion of the}} amplified pulse signal by imperfections of the power transistors and the <b>analogue</b> <b>output</b> circuitry. The only way to overcome this is to provide error correction by feedback. With a pulse-modulated signal (either PWM or Sigma-Delta-Modulation) this correction can be performed by changing the pulse edge timing, as it is done in some existing solutions. If error correction during the pulse generation inside of the digital system is desired, an Analogue- to Digital converter is needed. In this paper the most important solutions done so far are reviewed and further ideas based on feedback into the digital system are introduced...|$|E

A FDI system was developed {{which is based on}} adaptive fuzzy rules. A number of optimisation strategies were then applied; it was found that an evolutionary algorithm not only produced the best results but did so with relatively little processing effort and with excellent consistency. The adaptive fuzzy system, thus optimised, was tested against a neural network, which was trained to produce <b>analogue</b> <b>outputs</b> as an indication of fault magnitude. The fuzzy solution produced the best accuracy. We can conclude that an adaptive fuzzy inference system for FDI, using an evolutionary algorithm to learn from examples, can provide an accurate and readily comprehensible solution to diagnosing and evaluating fluid process plant faults...|$|R
