5|$|In 1582, Day's health {{began to}} {{deteriorate}} quickly. Though weakening, he raced to complete <b>another</b> <b>edition</b> of Actes and Monuments in 1583, printing it {{on at least}} four presses. It was unusual for books of this size and ambition to go beyond one or two printings. Holinshed's Chronicles, the only book of the time to rival the Book of Martyrs in scope and reputation, never went into a third edition.|$|E

5|$|Because amateur botany {{was popular}} in Britain {{during the second}} half of the eighteenth century, The Botanic Garden, despite its initial high cost, was a bestseller. In 1799 it was in a fourth edition as The Botanic Garden; A Poem in Two Parts at a smaller and more {{affordable}} octavo size, and this was another best-seller. There were three early Irish editions, and a second American edition had appeared by 1807. Despite the huge demand in 1799 and into the early 1800s, and cheaper pirated American and Irish imports, there was room in the market for <b>another</b> <b>edition</b> in Britain 1824 with a reprinting in 1825.|$|E
5|$|The atlas {{was not an}} {{immediate}} success. One reason may have been that it was incomplete: Spain was omitted {{and there were no}} detailed maps outside Europe. Rumold avowed that a second volume would attend to these deficiencies but it was not forthcoming and the whole project lost momentum; Rumold, who was 55 years old in 1595, was in decline and died in 1599. His family did produce <b>another</b> <b>edition</b> in 1602 but only the text was reset, there were no new maps. Another reason for the failure of the Atlas was the strength of the continuing sales of the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum of Abraham Ortelius. Alongside the sumptuous maps of that book Mercator's un-ornamented new maps looked very unattractive. Despite the death of Ortelius in 1598 the Theatrum flourished: in 1602 it was in its thirteenth Latin edition as well as editions in Dutch, Italian, French, German and Spanish. The Mercator atlas seemed destined for oblivion.|$|E

5|$|The first {{complete}} printed {{edition of}} the Leges was in 1644, as an appendix to a new {{edition of the}} Arcaionomia prepared by Abraham Wheelock. The actual text of the Leges was edited by Twysden. Prior to this, two other scholars, William Lambarde and Spelman, had intended to produce printed editions of the Leges, but were unable {{to follow through on}} the project. A portion of the Leges had earlier appeared in Edward Coke's Institutes of the Laws of England in 1628. <b>Another</b> <b>edition</b> appeared in 1721, with Wilkins' publication of the Leges Anglo-Saxonicae, which built on the work of William Somner between 1645 and 1652.
