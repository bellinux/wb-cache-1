25|$|The <b>ABC</b> <b>domain</b> {{consists}} of two domains, the catalytic core domain similar to RecA-like motor ATPases and a smaller, structurally diverse α-helical subdomain that is unique to ABC transporters. The larger domain typically {{consists of}} two β-sheets and six α helices, where the catalytic Walker A motif (GXXGXGKS/T where X is any amino acid) or P-loop and Walker B motif (ΦΦΦΦD, of which Φ is a hydrophobic residue) is situated.

25|$|The common {{feature of}} all ABC {{transporters}} {{is that they}} consist of two distinct domains, the transmembrane domain (TMD) and the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). The TMD, also known as membrane-spanning domain (MSD) or integral membrane (IM) domain, consists of alpha helices, embedded in the membrane bilayer. It recognizes a variety of substrates and undergoes conformational changes to transport the substrate across the membrane. The sequence and architecture of TMDs is variable, reflecting the chemical diversity of substrates that can be translocated. The NBD or ATP-binding cassette (<b>ABC)</b> <b>domain,</b> on the other hand, {{is located in the}} cytoplasm and has a highly conserved sequence. The NBD is the site for ATP binding. In most exporters, the N-terminal transmembrane domain and the C-terminal ABC domains are fused as a single polypeptide chain, arranged as TMD-NBD-TMD-NBD. An example is the E. coli hemolysin exporter HlyB. Importers have an inverted organization, that is, NBD-TMD-NBD-TMD, where the <b>ABC</b> <b>domain</b> is N-terminal whereas the TMD is C-terminal, such as in the E. coli MacB protein responsible for macrolide resistance.|$|E
25|$|Dimer {{formation}} of the two ABC domains of transporters requires ATP binding.

Structures of the ATP-bound state of isolated NBDs have been reported for importers including HisP, GlcV, MJ1267, E. coli MalK (E.c.MalK), T. litoralis MalK (TlMalK), and exporters such as TAP, HlyB, MJ0796, Sav1866, and MsbA. In these transporters, ATP is bound to the <b>ABC</b> <b>domain.</b> Two molecules of ATP are positioned at the interface of the dimer, sandwiched between the Walker A motif of one subunit and the LSGGQ motif of the other. This was first observed in Rad50 and reported in structures of MJ0796, the NBD subunit of the LolD transporter from Methanococcus jannaschii and E.c.MalK of a maltose transporter. These structures were also consistent with results from biochemical studies revealing that ATP is in close contact with residues in the P-loop and LSGGQ motif during catalysis.|$|E
40|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that {{functions as}} a chloride channel. Nucleotide-binding domain 1 (NBD 1), one of two <b>ABC</b> <b>domains</b> in CFTR, also contains sites for the predominant CF-causing mutation and, potentially, for regulatory phosphorylation. We have determined crystal structures for mouse NBD 1 in unliganded, ADP- and ATP-bound states, with and without phosphorylation. This NBD 1 differs from typical <b>ABC</b> <b>domains</b> in having added regulatory segments, a foreshortened subdomain interconnection, and an unusual nucleotide conformation. Moreover, isolated NBD 1 has undetectable ATPase activity and its structure {{is essentially the same}} independent of ligand state. Phe 508, which is commonly deleted in CF, is exposed at a putative NBD 1 -transmembrane interface. Our results are consistent with a CFTR mechanism, whereby channel gating occurs through ATP binding in an NBD 1 –NBD 2 nucleotide sandwich that forms upon displacement of NBD 1 regulatory segments...|$|R
40|$|Regulatory {{properties}} of estrogen receptor (ER) {{result from the}} existence of functional domains within its primary structure. Thus, A/B and C domains which are rich in tyrosyl residues control gene expression while the E domain confers estrogen binding capacity. Hydroxylapatite (HAP) is known to adsorb ER. Scatchard plot analysis of [3 H]estradiol binding patterns of HAP batches to which cytosolic ER had been adsorbed revealed that AB and/or C domains are mainly responsible for this property. Thus, treatment of these batches with the tyrosine reagent tetranitromethane (TNM) led to a dramatic release of adsorbed receptors. This did not occur with ER preparations devoid of exposed <b>ABC</b> <b>domains</b> obtained by selective immunoextraction with H- 226 anti-ER monoclonal antibody prior to HAP assay. KCl treatment (500 mM) of HAP batches also led to a release of bound receptors especially those devoid of exposed <b>ABC</b> <b>domains.</b> Such binding characteristics were also found with full length and truncated ERs produced in yeast: the full length receptor strongly interacted with HAP while the truncated receptor devoid of AB and C domains displayed only a weak adsorption. Additional investigation revealed that estradiol binding to cytosolic ER does not modify its reactivity towards TNM. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

A full transporter is often required to gain functionality. Some ABC transporters have additional elements that contribute to the regulatory function of this class of proteins. In particular, importers have a high-affinity binding protein (BP) that specifically associates with the substrate in the periplasm for delivery to the appropriate ABC transporter.

40|$|AbstractStructural {{maintenance}} of chromosome (SMC) proteins {{play a central}} role in higher-order chromosome structure in all kingdoms of life [1 – 5]. SMC proteins consist of a long coiled-coil domain that joins an ATP binding cassette (<b>ABC)</b> ATPase <b>domain</b> on one side and a dimerization domain on the other side [6]. SMC proteins require ATP binding or hydrolysis to promote cohesion and condensation, which is suggested to proceed via formation of SMC rings or assemblies [7 – 11]. To learn more about the role of ATP in the architecture of SMC proteins, we report crystal structures of nucleotide-free and ATP bound P. furiosus SMC ATPase domains. ATP dimerizes two SMC ATPase domains by binding to opposing Walker A and signature motifs, indicating that ATP binding can directly assemble SMC proteins. DNA stimulates ATP hydrolysis in the engaged SMC <b>ABC</b> <b>domains,</b> suggesting that ATP hydrolysis can be allosterically regulated. Structural and mutagenesis data identify an SMC protein conserved-arginine finger that is required for DNA stimulation of the ATPase activity and directly connects a putative DNA interaction site to ATP. Our results suggest that stimulation of the SMC ATPase activity may be a specific feature to regulate the ATP-driven assembly and disassembly of SMC proteins...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} the relative effects of thyrotropin (TSH) and TSH receptor autoantibodies in the sera {{of patients with}} autoimmune thyroid disease on three TSH-lutropin/chorionic gonadotropin (LH/CG) receptor extracellular domain chimeras. Each chimera binds TSH with high affinity. Only the chimera with TSH receptor extracellular <b>domains</b> <b>ABC</b> (amino acids 1 - 260) had a functional (cAMP) response to thyroid stimulatory IgG. The chimeras with TSH receptor domains CD (amino acids 171 - 360) and DE (amino acids 261 - 418) were unresponsive. The lack of response of the chimera with TSH receptor domains DE was anticipated because it fails to transduce a signal with TSH stimulation, unlike the other two chimeras. A different spectrum of responses occurred when the TSH-LH/CG chimeras were examined in terms of autoantibody competition for TSH binding. IgG with TSH binding-inhibitory activity when tested with the wild-type TSH receptor also inhibited TSH binding to the chimera with TSH receptor domains DE. Dramatically, however, these IgG did not inhibit TSH binding to the chimera with TSH receptor domains CD, and had weak or absent activity with the chimera with TSH receptor <b>domains</b> <b>ABC.</b> Chimeras with TSH receptor <b>domains</b> <b>ABC</b> and DE were equally effective in affinity-purifying IgG with thyroid-stimulatory and TSH binding-inhibitory activities. Nonstimulatory IgG with TSH binding-inhibitory activity inhibited the action of stimulatory IgG on the wild-type TSH receptor, {{but not with the}} chimera containing TSH receptor <b>domains</b> <b>ABC.</b> In summary, TSH receptor autoantibodies and TSH bind to regions in both <b>domains</b> <b>ABC</b> and DE of the TSH receptor extracellular region.

The following mechanism for the process has been proposed: One <b>ABC</b> <b>domain</b> binds the 40S subunit, while the other binds an initiation factor. Binding of ATP allows for dimerization, which subsequently brings the initiation factor and ribosomal subunit in close enough contact to associate. ATP hydrolysis releases the two substrates and allows the cycle to begin again.

Finally, ATPase activity was sensitive towards orthovanadate, with an IC 50 of 16  μM, consistent {{with the presence of}} transient dimers during ATP hydrolysis. Nevertheless, over a wide range of protein or of NaCl or KCl concentrations, the ABC ATPase was only detected as a monomer, as measured by ultracentrifugation or gel filtration. In contrast, in the absence of salt, the sedimentation velocity determined by analytical ultracentrifugation suggested a rapid equilibrium between monomers and dimers. Small amounts of dimers, but apparently only when stabilized by 8 -azido-ATP, were also detected by gel filtration, even in the presence of salt. These data are consistent with the fact that monomers can interact at least transiently and are the important species during ATP hydrolysis...|$|E
40|$|Previous studies [Malara et al ApJ, 533, 523 (2000) ] {{considered}} small-amplitude Alfven wave (AW) packets in Arnold-Beltrami-Childress (ABC) {{magnetic field}} using WKB approximation. In this work linearly polarised Alfven wave dynamics in ABC magnetic field via direct 3 D MHD numerical simulation is studied {{for the first}} time. Gaussian AW pulse with length-scale much shorter than <b>ABC</b> <b>domain</b> length and harmonic AW with wavelength equal to <b>ABC</b> <b>domain</b> length are studied for four different resistivities. While {{it is found that}} AWs dissipate quickly in the ABC field, surprisingly, AW perturbation energy increases in time. In the case of the harmonic AW perturbation energy growth is transient in time, attaining peaks in both velocity and magnetic perturbation energies within timescales much smaller than resistive time. In the case of the Gaussian AW pulse velocity perturbation energy growth is still transient in time, attaining a peak within few resistive times, while magnetic perturbation energy continues to grow. It is also shown that the total magnetic energy decreases in time and this is governed by the resistive evolution of the background ABC magnetic field rather than AW damping. On contrary, when background magnetic field is uniform, the total magnetic energy decrease is prescribed by AW damping, because there is no resistive evolution of the background. By considering runs with different amplitudes and by analysing perturbation spectra, possible dynamo action by AW perturbation-induced peristaltic flow and inverse cascade of magnetic energy have been excluded. Therefore, the perturbation energy growth is attributed to a new instability. The growth rate appears to be dependent on the value of the resistivity and spatial scale of the AW disturbance. Thus, when going beyond WKB approximation, AW damping, described by full MHD equations, does not guarantee decrease of perturbation energy. Comment: Accepted for publication in Phys.

40|$|P 5 <b>abc</b> <b>domain</b> of Tetrahymena LSU intron {{functions}} as an activator {{that is not}} essential for but enhances {{the activity of the}} ribozyme either when present in cis or when added in trans. This domain contains three regions (A-rich bulge, L 5 b, and L 5 c) that have been demonstrated to interact {{with the rest of the}} intron. Although these regions are presumably important for efficient activation, the role of each element is not understood in the mechanism of activation. We employed circularly permuted introns and examined the roles of each element. The results show that each of the three elements can activate the intron independently. We also found that a correlation between the activation by P 5 abc and the physical affinity of P 5 abc to the intron exists...|$|E
5000|$|Most ABC {{transporters}} that {{mediate the}} uptake of nutrients and other molecules in bacteria {{rely on a}} high-affinity solute binding protein (BP). BPs are soluble proteins located in the periplasmic space between {{the inner and outer}} membranes of gram-negative bacteria. Gram-positive microorganisms lack a periplasm such that their binding protein is often a lipoprotein bound to the external face of the cell membrane. Some gram-positive bacteria have BPs fused to the transmembrane domain of the transporter itself. The first successful x-ray crystal structure of an intact ABC importer is the molybdenum transporter (ModBC-A) from Archaeoglobus fulgidus. Atomic-resolution structures of three other bacterial importers, E. coli BtuCD, E. coli maltose transporter (MalFGK2-E), and the putative metal-chelate transporter of Haemophilus influenza, HI1470/1, have also been determined. The structures provided detailed pictures of the interaction of the transmembrane and <b>ABC</b> <b>domains</b> as well as revealed two different conformations with an opening in two opposite directions. Another common feature of importers is that each NBD is bound to one TMD primarily through a short cytoplasmic helix of the TMD, the [...] "coupling helix". This portion of the EAA loop docks in a surface cleft formed between the RecA-like and helical ABC subdomains and lies approximately parallel to the membrane bilayer.|$|R

Mutations in the bacterial uup gene, which encodes a cytosolic ABC ATPase, lead to an increase in the frequency of precise excision of transposons Tn 10 and Tn 5, suggesting a role of the Uup protein in DNA metabolism. Uup is a 72  kDa polypeptide which comprises two <b>ABC</b> <b>domains,</b> separated by a 75 -residue linker, and a C-terminal domain (CTD) of unknown function. The Uup protein from Escherichia coli has been shown to bind DNA in vitro, and the CTD domain contributes to the DNA-binding affinity. We have produced and purified uniformly labeled (15) N- and (15) N/(13) C Uup CTD domain (region 528 - 635), and assigned backbone and side-chains resonances using heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. Secondary structure evaluation based on backbone chemical shifts is consistent with the presence of three α-helices, including two long ones (residues 564 - 590 and 601 - 632), suggesting that Uup CTD may fold as an intramolecular coiled coil motif. This work provides the starting point towards determining the first atomic structure of a non-ATPase domain within the vast REG subfamily of ABC soluble ATPases...|$|R
40|$|Inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate receptors (InsP 3 R) and ryanodine receptors (RyR) are tetrameric {{intracellular}} Ca 2 + channels 1. For each, the pore {{is formed}} by C-terminal transmembrane domains and regulated by signals detected {{by the large}} cytosolic structures. InsP 3 R gating is initiated by InsP 3 binding to the InsP 3 -binding core (IBC, residues 224 - 604 of InsP 3 R 1) 2 and it requires the suppressor domain (SD, residues 1 - 223) 2 - 8. We present structures of the N-terminal region (NT) of InsP 3 R 1 with (3. 6 Å) and without (3. 0 Å) InsP 3 bound. The arrangement of the three NT domains, the SD, IBC-β and IBC-α, identifies two discrete interfaces (α and β) between the IBC and SD. Similar interfaces occur between equivalent domains (A, B and C) in RyR 19. The orientations of the three domains docked into a tetrameric structure of InsP 3 R 10 and of the <b>ABC</b> <b>domains</b> in RyR 9 are remarkably similar. The importance of the α-interface for activation of InsP 3 R and RyR is confirmed by mutagenesis and, for RyR, by disease-causing mutations 9, 11, 12. InsP 3 causes partial closure of the clam-like IBC, disrupting the β-interface and pulling the SD towards the IBC. This reorients an exposed SD loop (HS-loop) that is essential for InsP 3 R activation 7. The loop is conserved in RyR and includes mutations associated with malignan...|$|R
