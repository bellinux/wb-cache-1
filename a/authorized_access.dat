30|$|The {{purpose of}} using this model in our PoC was {{to ensure that}} a user is able to access only the data that he/she is <b>authorized</b> to <b>access.</b> Thus, {{limiting}} a user to use only the public data and only that part of his/her organization’s private data that he/she is <b>authorized</b> to <b>access.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Section (a)(4) of the CFAA makes liable {{anyone who}} [...] "knowingly and {{with intent to}} defraud, accesses a {{protected}} computer without authorization, or exceeds <b>authorized</b> <b>access,</b> and by means of such conduct furthers the intended fraud and obtains anything of value." [...] Neither party disputed that Nosal's accomplices were authorized to access Korn/Ferry computers, so the case hinged {{on whether or not}} they exceeded their <b>authorized</b> <b>access</b> when they downloaded the information for fraudulent purposes.|$|E

[...] He said that the CFAA was meant to target hackers who steal information or destroy functionality, not employees who use the internet instead of working. He points out that the CFAA defines [...] "exceeding authorized access" [...] as not just gaining access to a system without authorization, but also obtaining or altering information. Because Lee never obtained or altered information by accessing her Facebook, email or news, she was not exceeding <b>authorized</b> <b>access.</b>|$|E

For example, the user can use their Facebook credentials to log into Spotify, or another 3rd party application via their corporate cloud app (Google G Suite or Microsoft Office 365). With this access, the 3rd party app may have excessive access to the sanctioned app, thereby introducing up unintended risk.|$|R

40|$|Electronic health records (EHR) are a {{convenient}} method to exchange medical information of patients between different healthcare providers. In many countries privacy laws require {{to protect the}} confidentiality of these data records and let the patient control the access to them. Existing approaches to protect the privacy of EHRs are either insufficient for these strict laws or they are too restrictive in their usage. For example, smartcard-based encryption systems require the patient to be always present to <b>authorize</b> <b>access</b> to medical records. However, this does not allow a physician to access an EHR of a patient who is unable {{to show up in}} person. In this paper, we propose a security architecture for EHR infrastructures that provides more flexibility but retains the security of patient-controlled encryption. In our proposal patients are able to <b>authorize</b> <b>access</b> to their records re-motely (e. g. via phone) and time-independent for later pro-cessing by the physician. The security of our approach relies on modern cryptographic schemes and their incorporation into an EHR infrastructure. The adoption of our security architecture would allow to fulfill strict privacy laws while relaxing usage restrictions of existing security protections...|$|R

Employees of foreign persons holding Dual or Third Country Nationality from countries proscribed under ITAR 126.1, such as Vietnam, the Peoples Republic of China ("PRC"), North Korea, Syria and Iran, will, as a general rule, not be <b>authorized</b> to have <b>access</b> to USML items.

50|$|The Fifth Circuit {{concluded}} that John exceeded <b>authorized</b> <b>access</b> to a protected computer within {{the meaning of}} CFAA.

50|$|Laptop theft is a {{significant}} threat to users of laptop and netbook computers.

50|$|Lenders, such as {{banks and}} credit card companies, use credit scores to {{evaluate}} the potential risk posed by lending money to consumers and to mitigate losses due to bad debt. Lenders use credit scores to determine who qualifies for a loan, at what interest rate, and what credit limits. Lenders also use credit scores to determine which customers are likely {{to bring in the}} most revenue. The use of credit or identity scoring prior to <b>authorizing</b> <b>access</b> or granting credit is an implementation of a trusted system.|$|R
