5|$|An episode {{featuring}} a storyline about a school shooting garnered the series {{an all-time high}} audience of 930,000 Canadian viewers. A second episode with a storyline about oral sex also earned just under 1,000,000 viewers.

In the US, the season received an 80% larger audience compared to season three, and one episode received 540,000 viewers and drew a Nielsen rating of 2.7 for teenagers and 4.7 for female teenagers, meaning that on average 2.7% of the nation's teenagers, and 4.7% of the nation's female teenagers were tuned in at any given moment.|$|E

30|$|Panel A of Table  8 {{shows the}} {{coefficients}} on ASY for different saturated versions of model (1), {{where we have}} included polynomials on SIZE <b>and</b> <b>Age.</b> Since these coefficients are quite stable from the simplest models to the more saturated models on size <b>and</b> <b>age,</b> {{these findings suggest that}} ASY contains information beyond SIZE <b>and</b> <b>Age</b> that is relevant for capital structure. In addition, we have performed two other tests. First, we have orthogonalised SIZE and ASY, by regressing ASY on SIZE, and taking the residuals as the part of ASY which is not explained by SIZE (r_ASY). Second, we have regressed ASY on SIZE <b>and</b> <b>Age,</b> <b>and</b> we have taken the residuals as the part of ASY which is not explained by SIZE <b>and</b> <b>Age</b> (z_ASY). Then, we include r_ASY or z_ASY in the original model with size or size <b>and</b> <b>age</b> controls, respectively, instead of our original ASY variable. The results, as shown in the Panel B of Table  8, are also significant and the coefficients on r_ASY or z_ASY are very stable. Overall, all these findings suggest that the effect of ASY on firm’s debt financing decisions is not caused by firm size <b>and</b> <b>age.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{the initial}} {{plans for the}} series, Jack {{was going to die}} midway through the first episode. The role of Jack was {{originally}} offered to Michael Keaton, but when the producers quickly changed their minds about Jack's death, making him the leader, Keaton gave up the job. After Matthew Fox's casting as Jack, the character was established as a leader, and the airplane pilot was introduced to take Jack's place as The Monster's first victim. The pilot wound up being played by Greg Grunberg, a childhood friend of Abrams who the producer brings into most of his projects. Around seventy-five women of different shapes, sizes, ethnicities <b>and</b> <b>ages</b> auditioned to be Kate. In the initial plans, Kate would emerge as the leader after Jack died. She {{was not going to be}} a fugitive, instead her husband was going to go to the bathroom shortly before the plane split in mid air, and she would remain adamant on the Island that he was alive. This ended up being used for Rose's (L. Scott Caldwell) character instead. The producers were impressed with Canadian Evangeline Lilly's audition for Kate, as she displayed the confidence with vulnerability that they were looking for. As this was Lilly's first role, she had difficulty obtaining a visa to work in America. She was supposed to start on the first day of filming, but the schedule was rearranged to give her more time, and in the meantime, the producers began auditioning again in case the visa did not come through. However, during one of the auditions, they got an email confirming that she had obtained her visa and could start work on the show.|$|E

There were 45 students from each school [...] Knowledge about <b>aged</b> condition <b>and</b> <b>aging</b> of the medical and biotechnology students was quite low. There were no significant differences (p= 0. 199) between the two groups. The AAS data showed that respondents did not have any fear of old people. They were also not really concern about physiological and physical appearances and were not afraid of lost. The ASD data showed that they tended to have positive views: the elderly people are useful, independent, and able to accept their condition.
