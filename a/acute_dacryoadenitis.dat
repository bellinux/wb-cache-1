40|$|<b>Acute</b> <b>dacryoadenitis</b> is an {{uncommon}} disease. Case: We present {{what we believe}} to be the first reported case of herpes zoster ophthalmicus with the onset of <b>acute</b> <b>dacryoadenitis.</b> Observations: A 30 -year-old man complained of severe ocular pain and hyperemia in his right eye. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated enlargement of the right lacri-mal gland and <b>acute</b> <b>dacryoadenitis</b> was diagnosed. Two days after treatment with systemic antibiotics he developed iridocyclitis and skin lesions confined to the first division of the trigeminal nerve; therefore, herpes zoster ophthalmicus was diagnosed. Treatment with acy-clovir immediately resolved the ocular pain and swelling of the upper eyelid. MRI conducted in the 4 months after the initial examination showed there was no longer enlargement of the right lacrimal gland. Conclusion: Clinicians should be aware that varicella-zoster virus may cause acute dacryoad-enitis...|$|E
30|$|Lacrimal gland {{bacterial}} abscesses are uncommon and {{may arise}} {{in the setting of}} <b>acute</b> <b>dacryoadenitis,</b> which may in turn develop secondary to an adjacent infection, such as rhinosinusitis, from hematogenous spread of bacteremia or after trauma [1, 2]. We present two patients with lacrimal gland abscess presenting with preseptal cellulitis depicted on computed tomography (CT).|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{present a}} series of {{patients}} with <b>acute</b> suppurative bacterial <b>dacryoadenitis</b> and review the clinical presentation, microbiology, treatment options and outcome. METHODS: A multicentre, retrospective, case series review of patients with a clinical diagnosis of <b>acute</b> bacterial suppurative <b>dacryoadenitis</b> (ASBD). Records were examined to obtain information regarding patient demographics, presenting symptoms and signs, radiology, microbiology, management, outcomes and follow-up. RESULTS: 11 patients (9 men, 2 women; mean age 43. 9 years, range: 6 - 82 years) were included. Average time to presentation was 2. 8 days, and predisposing conditions were found in 45 % of cases. Common presenting symptoms were eyelid swelling, pain, redness and diplopia, and common signs were ptosis, discharge and restriction of eye movements. The most common causative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus and skin flora. Lacrimal gland swelling was universally seen on CT, with globe indentation of displacement in 27 % of cases. Intravenous antibiotics were used in 91 % of cases, which subsequently resolved over an average period of 9. 7 days. Those with abscess formation (n= 2) required incision and drainage. CONCLUSIONS: ASBD is a rare condition that resolves quickly if managed appropriately. Underlying anatomical, infectious or inflammatory conditions should be investigated, and skin commensals should be covered with the instigation of antibiotic therapy.

40|$|Introduction Almost all organs can be {{involved}} in the infection by Epstein–Barr virus and consequently, the beginning symptoms of infectious mononucleosis may be different. Materials and methods We report a case of infection by Epstein–Barr virus in a 17 -year-old girl whose primary manifestation was an initially monolateral and subsequently bilateral dacryoadenitis. Results The incidence of <b>acute</b> <b>dacryoadenitis</b> by Epstein–Barr virus is valued around one case per million people per year, but it is probably underestimated: it is due to infiltration of the lacrimal gland by activated lymphocytes. Discussion An <b>acute</b> <b>dacryoadenitis,</b> especially when it affects a young adult and when bilateral, should guide the diagnostic and haematochemical and serological investigations towards a systemic disease such as infectious mononucleosis. It is almost always responsive to a systemic corticosteroid therapy, but in some cases it can progress towards a dacryocystitis and exceptionally towards the Sjögren syndrome. Appropriate and timely treatment will be able to reduce any subsequent complications. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstarct not {{available}} [...] . Infectious mononucleosis is an acute febrile illness caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). It was first linked with upper eyelid oedema and lacrimal gland inflammation in the 1950 s. Dacryadenitis, more frequently unilateral, {{has been described}} in the last decades but has rarely been reported recently. Extrapolation from the population frequency of infectious mononucleosis yields an estimated incidence of EBV dacryoadenitis of one case per one million people per year (Rhem et al. 2000). A case of bilateral <b>acute</b> <b>dacryoadenitis</b> and tonsillitis in association with infectious mononucleosis is described [...] ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Acute</b> <b>dacryoadenitis</b> is an {{uncommon}} condition that involves {{inflammation of the}} lacrimal gland. In rare instances, dacryoadenitis may be bilateral. A delay in proper treatment of an otherwise simple case of dacryoadenitis may lead to significant soft tissue morbidity such as cellulitis, lacrimal gland abscess, or orbital abscess. We report {{the case of a}} 24 -year-old male who presented to the emergency department with acute bilateral dacryoadenitis. The patient′s symptoms did not respond to oral antibiotics and he subsequently required admission for intravenous antibiotics. During his hospitalization the patient had diagnostic testing to try to determine the etiology for his symptoms. The unique aspects of managing a case of bilateral dacryoadenitis as well as treatment recommendations are discussed in this case report...|$|E
40|$|Os autores apresentam um caso raro de dacrioadenite aguda {{bilateral}} associada à mononucleose. Paciente do sexo feminino, 27 anos, tinha aumento agudo da glândula lacrimal, bilateral, com sinais flogísticos. As alterações tomográficas e laboratoriais confirmaram o diagnóstico e o tratamento com esteróide sistêmico foi introduzido, com resolução completa dos sinais e sintomas. COMENTÁRIOS: A dacrioadenite é uma apresentação incomum da mononucleose infecciosa e pode minimizar outras manifestações desta doença. O diagnóstico de mononucleose deve ser considerado em casos de dacrioadenite aguda bilateral. Os esteróides sistêmicos contribuem para a resolução do quadro inflamatório. The authors {{present a}} rare case of acute bilateral dacryoadenitis {{in association with}} infectious mononucleosis. A 27 year-old woman had acute bilateral lacrimal gland enlargement with inflammatory signs. The CT scan findings and laboratorial investigations confirmed the diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis. The systemic treatment with intravenous steroids was initiated leading to complete remission of the signs and symptoms. COMMENTS: Dacryoadenitis is an uncommon manifestation of infectious mononucleosis and may minimize other signs of the disease. Mononucleosis has {{to be considered in}} <b>acute</b> <b>dacryoadenitis</b> cases. Systemic steroids contribute to the fast regression of inflammatory condition...|$|E
