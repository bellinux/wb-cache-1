40|$|Abstract Smile is an {{expression}} of happiness, self-confidence, kindness and beauty. Along with teeth and lips, gingiva is also a vital component of smile. Melanin induced gingival hyper pigmentation may appear un-aesthetic especially when it is associated with high smile line, upper <b>anterior</b> <b>labial</b> segment and is uneven in appearance. It affects individuals from all races. Generally, it is believed that melanin induced gingival hyper pigmentation is confined to individuals from dark races. But studies have shown that Iranian, Indian, Italian, Arabian, Greek. German, French, Japanese, Chinese, Jewish, Thai, Malaysian and other ethnic groups also display clinical gingival pigmentation. 1 Gingival hyper pigmentation may result in psychological distress especially when the appearance is of utmost importance for the individuals. This article aims to focus on the physiology, clinical appearance and treatment options available for the melanin induced gingival hyper pigmentation along with the reported recurrence in the light of current literature...|$|R

Each labium majus has two surfaces, an outer, pigmented and covered with strong, pubic hair; and an inner, smooth and beset with large sebaceous follicles. The labia majora are covered with squamous epithelium. Between the two there is a considerable quantity of areolar tissue, fat, and a tissue resembling the dartos tunic of the scrotum, besides vessels, nerves, and glands. The labia majora are thicker in front, and form the <b>anterior</b> <b>labial</b> commissure where they meet below the mons pubis.

40|$|SUMMARY An imprint culture {{technique}} has been employed {{to study the}} prevalence and intraoral distribution of Candida albicans in 16 patients with Sjogren's syndrome and in 16 healthy controls matched for age, sex, and dental status. The prevalence and intraoral density of C. albicans {{was found to be}} significantly higher at almost all sites in the Sjogren's patients than in the controls. The distribution of candida was also altered, being significantly higher in the floor of the mouth and <b>anterior</b> <b>labial</b> sulcus in the Sjogren's group. There was an approximate inverse relationship between candida populations and rate of salivary flow. Mean candida densities were found to be significantly higher in those Sjogren's patients with detectable serum rheumatoid factor in the serum. However, patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome had significantly higher mean candida densities compared with patients with secondary Sjogren's syndrome. Sjogren's (1933) syndrome is characterised by xerophthalmia, xerostomia, and, in most cases, an associated connective tissue disorder (Bloch et al., 1965). Chisholm and Mason (1973) state, without supporting data, that oral candida infections are common in Sjbgren's syndrome. Using an imprint culture technique, a normal range for the oral density and distribution of Candida albicans has recently been established for healthy subjects (Arendorf and Walker, 1979 a). In healthy carriers, there was an upper limit to the density of C. albicans found at any site, which was, however, regularly exceeded in candida infections. In the present investigation, quantitative imprint cultures have been used to assess whether the prevalence or intraoral dens ty and distribution of C. albicans is significantly altered in Sj 6 gren's syndrome compared with that of normal subjects. The serum candida fluorescent antibody titres were also determined since Lehner (1966) suggested that this test could also discriminate between the healthy carrier state and oral candidosis...|$|R
40|$|The Traversodontidae {{represent}} one of {{the most}} diverse and abundant families of non-mammaliaform cynodonts, particularly in Gondwanan faunas of Middle to Late Triassic age. Although a great diversity of traversodontids is known for South American (approximately nine species) andAfrican (six to seven species) Triassic faunas, the record of the group in these continents does not show similarities beyond the family level. Here we describe a new traversodontid, Luangwa sudamericana, from the Santa Maria Formation of southern Brazil, which is most similar to the Anisian traversodontids Luangwa drysdalli from the upper portion of the Ntawere Formation in Zambia, and Scalenodon angustifrons from the Manda Formation in Tanzania. Features in common with these African taxa are oval-outlined upper postcanines presenting an <b>anterior</b> <b>labial</b> cingulum. The new species is similar to L. drysdalli in a number of features, including the presence of a posterior cingulum in the upper postcanines, anterior cingulum in front of the transverse crest in the lower postcanines, short snout, enormous orbits and short temporal region. Differences with L. drysdalli are the less developed posterior cingulum behind the upper transverse crest that does not extend along the entire posterior border of the tooth, and the presence of a well-defined posterior accessory cusp on the sectorial crest of the upper postcanines. The comparison of the quadrate, preserved in situ in the squamosal notch of the new taxon, and that from other traversodontids, suggests that the quadratojugal is involved {{in the formation of the}} lateral condyle of the traversodontid suspensorium. Luangwa represents the first genus of traversodontid, and the second of non-mammaliaform cynodont shared by South American and African faunas.

The subject's head was firmly fixed in place, and the occlusal splint was fully seated on the mandibular dentition. The subject was then asked to make various mouth movements while the mandibular movement target locus point set was recorded. Comparisons between the coordinate values and the actual values of the 30 intersections on the detection target were then analyzed using paired t-tests. The three-dimensional trajectory curve shapes of the mandibular movements were consistent with the respective subject movements. Mean XYZ coordinate values and paired t-test results were as follows: X axis: - 0. 0037 ± 0. 02953, P = 0. 502; Y axis: 0. 0037 ± 0. 05242, P = 0. 704; and Z axis: 0. 0007 ± 0. 06040, P = 0. 952.

30|$|The mandibular incisors had {{significantly}} greater labial tipping in the Bionator {{than in the}} control group and significantly greater protrusion and intrusion in the experimental compared to the control group (Table  7). These effects are in accordance with previous studies which pointed protrusion of these teeth using the Jasper Jumper [10]–[12],[17] as well as its intrusion [10],[12],[17]. Labial tipping in the Jasper Jumper was not statistically significant compared to the control group. This effect was probably minimized due to the lingual torque which was incorporated in the rectangular archwire in the mandibular anterior teeth [14]. It is well known that the forces applied by fixed functional appliances in class II treatment have an intrusive vector in the mandibular incisors. Thus, the significant limitation of the vertical development of the mandibular incisors observed in the Jasper Jamper group compared to the control group is due to the intrusive effect of this appliance in the <b>anterior</b> region. <b>Labial</b> tipping of mandibular incisors in patients treated with the Bionator was previously described in the literature [2],[18],[20]–[23],[26], whereas one study [22] reported that these teeth had no significant changes during treatment with this appliance.|$|R
40|$|Statement of Problem: Labial access cavity {{preparation}} is a conventional method in endodontic {{treatment of the}} anterior teeth, but in some conditions labial {{cavity preparation}} is recommended. Purpose: The {{aim of this study}} was to compare labial and lingual access cavity preparation in the permanent <b>anterior</b> teeth with <b>labial</b> caries in terms of the remaining tooth structure and fracture resistance. Materials and Method: In this experimental study, 150 intact permanent human anterior teeth were selected in 5 groups each with 30 teeth including the maxillary central, maxillary lateral, maxillary canine, mandibular incisors and mandibular canine. A class V cavity with similar ratios to dimensions of each tooth was prepared on the labial surface of all specimens. The volumes of each of these teeth were measured by Penta Pycnometer before and after class V cavity preparation (V 1, V 2). Each group was randomly divided into 2 equal subgroups (n= 15). Access cavities were prepared labially in subgroup A and lingually in subgroup B; then, the remained volume of each tooth was measured again (V 3). The mean proportional volume loss of each tooth was calculated through access preparation (V 2 -V 3 /V 1). Then, the specimens were embedded in acrylic resin blocks and subjected to load with a universal testing machine. Results: The differences of mean of theremained volume and fracture resistance of the two subgroups were statistically significant in all groups (p < 0. 05) and those teeth with labial access showed more remained volume and fracture resistance than lingual access. Conclusion: Labial access cavity preparation can enhance the remained volume and fracture resistance as compared to lingual access in endodontic treatment of the <b>anterior</b> teeth with <b>labial</b> caries especially in mandibular incisors...|$|R
40|$|Background: Lobular {{capillary}} hemangioma is {{a common}} benign vascular tumor seen in the oral cavity. It occurs in response to various stimuli such as low-grade local irritation, traumatic insult, and hormonal factors or {{as a response to}} a wide variety of drugs. Materials and Methods: All patients presenting to the Department of Dentistry, Shyam Shah Medical College, Rewa, Madhya Pradesh during July 2014 to June 2016, who were diagnosed by histopathologic confirmation as oral lobular capillary hemangioma (OLCH), were evaluated for the area involved, clinicopathologic presentation, demographic features, and treatment. Results: A total of 94 cases were identified as OLCH by histopathologic confirmation during this period. The lesion occurred most commonly in the age group of 21 – 30 years. A characteristic female predominance (female: male ratio of 2. 24 : 1) was seen. <b>Anterior</b> maxillary <b>labial</b> gingiva was most frequently involved (34. 04 %) followed by posterior maxillary buccal gingiva (14. 89 %). Conclusion: The clinicopathologic picture of OLCH found in this study was similar to other studies conducted on same as well different ethnic and geographical populations. Poor oral-dental-hygiene was observed in majority of patients (87. 23 %) dental health education should be an integral component of imparting oral health care by health providers.

40|$|The {{arthropod}} head {{problem has}} puzzled zoologists {{for more than}} a century. The head of adult arthropods is a complex structure resulting from the modification, fusion and migration of an uncertain number of segments. In contrast, onychophorans, which are the probable sister group to the arthropods, have a rather simple head comprising three segments that are well defined during development, and give rise to the adult head with three pairs of appendages specialised for sensory and food capture/manipulative purposes. Based on the expression pattern of the <b>anterior</b> Hox genes <b>labial,</b> proboscipedia, Hox 3 and Deformed, we show that the third of these onychophoran segments, bearing the slime papillae, can be correlated to the tritocerebrum, the most anterior Hox-expressing arthropod segment. This implies that both the onychophoran antennae and jaws are derived from a more anterior, Hox-free region corresponding to the proto and deutocerebrum of arthropods. Our data provide molecular support for the proposal that the onychophoran head possesses a well-developed appendage that corresponds to the anterior, apparently appendage-less region of the arthropod head. 6 page(s...|$|R
30|$|Several {{studies had}} been {{conducted}} to assess biomechanical properties of the loops, used for <b>anterior</b> retraction in <b>labial</b> orthodontics, but no such attempt had been done so far in lingual orthodontics. In 2006, Safavi et al. [8] conducted a study to compare biomechanical characteristics of T-loop, vertical helical loop, L-loop, and opus loop of 0.016 [*]×[*] 0.022 {{wire of stainless steel}} but did not consider the modeling of brackets (whether lingual or labial) or tooth along with the root or the compensatory curvatures. They obtained higher force in their study as they did not consider placement of wire in the brackets. Hence, the moment obtained by them was also higher and was not truly representative of moment obtained during orthodontics tooth movement. The M/F ratio of T-loop (13.4) was also higher in their study because of the difference in the loop design and length, difference in the material used for fabricating the loop (made of stainless steel), degree of compensatory curvatures, and importantly the fact that their study was on labial orthodontics. Such higher M/F ratios at anterior end in their study are representative of root movement that is difficult to attain on 1  mm activation in reality.|$|R
40|$|By SEM we have {{investigated}} the human minor salivary glands using the NaOH method for the visualization of endpieces and myoepithelial cells, and the osmium maceration technique that reveals membranous intracellular structures. With the former method all minor glands, including the posterior deep (Ebner's) lingual glands, consist of tubules sometimes dilated into alveoli, while true acini of the kind observed in human major salivary glands, are absent. Tubules of the posterior deep lingual gland exhibit stellate myoepitelial cells that leave {{a substantial part of}} the secretory cells uncovered. The latter cells, at variance with serous cells of major glands, do not show basal folds. In contrast, tubules of the other minor glands, like the mucous ones of major glands, are covered almost completely by band-like myoepithelial cells. The osmium maceration method clearly demonstrates that posterior deep lingual glands are serous in character and that all the other minor glands, together with the predominant mucous cells, possess a variable number of seromucous cells that, despite variations among individuals, increase in order from palatine and posterior superficial lingual (Weber's), to minor sublingual, <b>labial,</b> <b>anterior</b> lingual (Blandin and Nuhn's), and buccal glands...|$|R
