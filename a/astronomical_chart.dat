2500|$|The astronomical {{predictions}} of Ptolemy's geocentric model {{were used to}} prepare astrological and <b>astronomical</b> <b>charts</b> for over 1500 years. The geocentric model held sway into the early modern age, but from the late 16th century onward, it was gradually superseded by the Heliocentric model of Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler. [...] There was much resistance to the transition between these two theories. [...] Christian theologians were reluctant to reject a theory that agreed with Bible passages (e.g. [...] "Sun, stand you still upon Gibeon", [...] ).

50|$|Allegra Doucet {{was with}} a client on Friday night, when the client excused himself {{to go to the}} bathroom. Madam Frost then showed up on some {{friendly}} pretense, but Allegra didn't know what was happening until it was too late. Frost stabbed her several times, enough times that Allegra was dead before her body even hit the floor. Then the toilet flushed and Madam Frost realized that there was another person in the house. By the time she got to the bathroom, the client had escaped out the window. This client had seen too much, and Frost needed to silence him or her. She used the <b>astronomical</b> <b>chart</b> to find people in San Francisco born on February 20, 1962, and used this chart to track the witness down. Frost was in a hurry to kill the witness before he could tell the police. All three of the other murders were improvised, and like Allegra, these victims were killed from behind or by surprise.|$|E
50|$|Classical Chinese {{astronomy}} {{is recorded}} in the Han period and appears {{in the form of}} three schools, which are attributed to astronomers of the Warring States period. The constellations of the three schools were conflated into a single system by Chen Zhuo, an astronomer of the 3rd century (Three Kingdoms period). Chen Zhuo's work has been lost, but information on his system of constellations survives in Tang period records, notably by Qutan Xida. The oldest extant Chinese star chart dates to that period and was preserved as part of the Dunhuang Manuscripts. Native Chinese astronomy flourished during the Song dynasty, and during the Yuan Dynasty became increasingly influenced by medieval Islamic astronomy (see Treatise on Astrology of the Kaiyuan Era). As maps were prepared during this period on more scientific lines they were considered as more reliable. A well known map prepared during the Song Period is the Suzhou <b>Astronomical</b> <b>Chart</b> prepared with carvings of most stars on the planisphere of the Chinese Sky on a stone plate; it is done accurately based on observations and has the suprnova of the year of 1054 in Taurus carved on it.|$|E
25|$|A major advance was the {{introduction}} of the caravel in the mid-15th century, a small ship able to sail windward more than any other in Europe at the time. Evolved from fishing ships designs, they were the first that could leave the coastal cabotage navigation and sail safely on the open Atlantic. For celestial navigation the Portuguese used the Ephemerides, which experienced a remarkable diffusion in the 15th century. These were <b>astronomical</b> <b>charts</b> plotting the location of the stars over a distinct period of time. Published in 1496 by the Jewish astronomer, astrologer, and mathematician Abraham Zacuto, the Almanach Perpetuum included some of these tables for the movements of stars. These tables revolutionized navigation, allowing the calculation of latitude. Exact longitude, however, remained elusive, and mariners struggled to determine it for centuries. Using the caravel, systematic exploration continued ever more southerly, advancing on average one degree a year. Senegal and Cape Verde Peninsula were reached in 1445 and in 1446, Álvaro Fernandes pushed on almost as far as present-day Sierra Leone.|$|R

5000|$|Also, {{according}} to Ruppelt, {{when he was}} able to interview the radar and control tower personnel at Washington National Airport, not a single person agreed with the Air Force explanation. Michael Wertheimer, a researcher for the government-funded Condon Report, investigated the case in 1966. He found that the radar witnesses still disputed the Air Force explanation, but that did not stop the report from agreeing with the temperature inversion/mirage explanation. Ruppelt related that on July 27 the control tower at Washington National had called the control tower at Andrews AFB and notified them that their radar had an unknown object just south of the Andrews control tower, directly over the Andrews AFB radio range station. According to Ruppelt, when the Andrews control tower personnel looked they all saw [...] "a huge fiery-orange sphere" [...] hovering over the range station. When Ruppelt interviewed the tower personnel several days later, they insisted that they had been mistaken and had merely seen a bright star. However, when Ruppelt checked an <b>astronomical</b> <b>chart</b> he found that there were no bright stars over the station that night, and that he had [...] "heard from a good source that the tower men had been 'persuaded' a bit" [...] by superior officers to claim that their sighting was merely a star.|$|E

40|$|The recent {{discovery}} of Chinese medical manuscripts in a tomb dated {{to the second}} century BC in Ma-wang-tui, Ch'ang-sha, has revealed extremely interesting new information {{on the subject of}} ancient Chinese childbirth practices.

50|$|Once out {{of sight}} of the coast, Portuguese and Spanish ship pilots could rely upon the {{astrolabe}} and quadrant to determine their location on a north/south reference, however longitude was noticeably more difficult to acquire. The problem was time. Out on the vast stretches of the ocean, it is very difficult to keep track of time once leaving port. In order to calculate longitude a sailor would need to know the time difference between his current location and a fixed point somewhere on earth, usually the port of call. Even if one could determine the time of day while in deep waters, they still needed to know the time at their home port. The answer was the ephemerides, <b>astronomical</b> <b>charts</b> plotting the location of the stars over a distinct period of time.Published in 1496 by the Jewish astronomer, astrologer, and mathematician Abraham Zacuto, the Almanach Perpetuum included tables for the movements of stars. Through the use of an astrolabe, also perfected by Zacuto who advanced it from a crude wooden tool to an accurate brass instrument, sailors could determine the time at home. Zacuto himself was born in Spain in 1451 and took refuge in Lisbon during the expulsion of the Jews. He eventually was invited by King John II of Portugal, much like Pedro Nunes, to become the Royal Astronomer, a position he accepted and used to promote exploration, particularly investigating a sea route to India.|$|R

5000|$|In {{order to}} {{accurately}} record time {{on board a}} vessel sundials had been attempted, however the unpredictable nature of swells made the actual reading of the instrument almost impossible. Up until {{the emergence of the}} nocturnal, the only way captains could keep track of time was through the use of sand or water clocks, for example an hourglass. However, they required the constant attention {{for the duration of the}} voyage in order to reset the cycles on the hour. With the publishing of the Arte of Navigation by Cortes came the first detailed description of the construction and use of a nocturnal, once again an apparatus that relied on the stars. The nocturnal revolutionized long distance seafaring by complementing the use of the astrolabe and ephemerides by now giving sailors an accurate tool with which to discover the time at their position. Both Zacuto and Cortes were respected mathematicians and had determined in their respective publications the trigonometric measurements concerning the degrees of latitude and longitude. If a ship’s pilot or navigator used the nocturnal to read their time, and then consulted an astrolabe in concert with <b>astronomical</b> <b>charts</b> they could determine the time distance between themselves and a fixed location. The trigonometry, dictated particularly in Zacuto’s work, then allowed a sailor to calculate the degree difference east or west of the fixed position. For instance, if the time variance between port and ship was two hours, a sailor would know that he was 30 degrees east of port, if he was sailing in the Atlantic from the Iberian Peninsula. Cross referenced with latitude, a captain would know his exact location regardless of landmarks or coastline as long as the night sky was clear. [...] Captains could now plot their course accurately and reliably as they extended their travels farther and farther from home.|$|R
