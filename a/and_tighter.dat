5|$|The uniform {{made its}} Olympic debut at Sydney's Bondi Beach in the 2000 Summer Olympics amid some criticism. It {{was the fifth}} largest {{television}} audience of all the sports at the 2000 Games. Much of the interest {{was because of the}} sex appeal of bikini-clad players along with their athletic ability. Bikini-clad dancers and cheerleaders entertain the audience during match breaks in many beach volleyball tournaments, including the Olympics. Even indoor volleyball costumes followed suit to become smaller <b>and</b> <b>tighter.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sigismund II's childlessness added {{urgency to}} the idea of turning the {{personal}} union between Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania into a more permanent <b>and</b> <b>tighter</b> relationship; it was also a priority for the execution movement. Lithuania's laws were codified and reforms enacted in 1529, 1557, 1565–1566 and 1588, gradually making its social, legal and economic system similar to that of Poland, with the expanding role of the middle and lower nobility. Fighting wars with Moscow under Ivan IV and the threat perceived from that direction provided additional motivation for the real union for both Poland and Lithuania.|$|E

25|$|The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) is an {{organisation}} {{that advocates}} unilateral nuclear disarmament by the United Kingdom, international nuclear disarmament <b>and</b> <b>tighter</b> international arms regulation through agreements {{such as the}} Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

CND favours nuclear disarmament by all countries <b>and</b> <b>tighter</b> international regulation through treaties such as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. CND is also opposed to any new nuclear power stations being built in the United Kingdom. One of the activities most strongly associated with CND is the Aldermaston Marches.|$|E
25|$|Several {{other type}} {{designers}} modelled typefaces from this popular typeface. Max Miedinger at the Haas Foundry {{used it as}} a model for the typeface Neue Haas-Grotesk, released in 1957 and renamed Helvetica in 1961. Miedinger sought to refine the typeface making it more even and unified, with a higher x-height <b>and</b> <b>tighter</b> spacing. Two other releases from 1957, Adrian Frutiger's Univers and Bauer and Baum's Folio, take inspiration from Akzidenz-Grotesk.|$|E
25|$|The wide, high-waisted {{look of the}} {{previous}} period was gradually superseded by a long vertical line, with horizontal emphasis at the shoulder. Full, loose sleeves ended just below the elbow at mid century and became longer <b>and</b> <b>tighter</b> {{in keeping with the}} new trend. The body was tightly corseted, with a low, broad neckline and dropped shoulder. In later decades, the overskirt was drawn back and pinned up to display the petticoat, which was heavily decorated.|$|E

25|$|Metabolic {{adaptation}} in tumours {{balances the}} cells' need for energy with equally important need for macromolecular building blocks <b>and</b> <b>tighter</b> control of redox balance. As a result, production of NADPH is greatly enhanced, which {{functions as a}} cofactor to provide reducing power in many enzymatic reactions for macromolecular biosynthesis {{and at the same}} time rescuing the cells from excessive ROS produced during rapid proliferation. Cells counterbalance the detrimental effects of ROS by producing antioxidant molecules, such as reduced glutathione (GSH) and thioredoxin (TRX), which rely on the reducing power of NADPH to maintain their activities.|$|E
25|$|Higher speeds <b>and</b> <b>tighter</b> turns require greater lean angles. If {{the mass}} is not first {{leaned into the}} turn, the inertia of the rider and bike will cause them to {{continue}} {{in a straight line}} as the tires track out from under them along the curve. The transition of riding in a straight line to negotiating a turn is a process of leaning the bike into the turn, and the most practical way to cause that lean (of the combined center of mass of bike and rider) is to move the support points in the opposite direction first.|$|E
25|$|Neither side of {{the island}} is part of the Schengen Area; full border checks are {{performed}} when travelling between the island and Europe. Passport controls are also exercised when taking the ferry from Marigot or Princess Juliana International Airport to Anguilla. There are rarely checks at the border between {{the two sides of the}} island. The Franco-Dutch treaty on Saint Martin border controls requires a working group that has never been set up, to harmonize external checks at the two main airports. The Dutch side has expressed concern that new <b>and</b> <b>tighter</b> French visa requirements would harm their tourism income.|$|E

25|$|Narrow-gauge {{railways}} usually {{cost less}} to build {{because they are}} usually lighter in construction, using smaller cars and locomotives (smaller loading gauge), as well as smaller bridges, smaller tunnels (smaller structure gauge) <b>and</b> <b>tighter</b> curves. Narrow gauge is thus often used in mountainous terrain, where the savings in civil engineering work can be substantial. It is also used in sparsely populated areas where the potential demand is too low for broader gauge railways to be economically viable. This {{is the case in}} some of Australia and most of Southern Africa, where extremely poor soils have led to population densities too low for standard gauge to be viable.|$|E
25|$|As an {{electron}} enters a magnetic field, it feels a Lorentz force and corkscrews. The radius of this motion is the gyroradius. As it moves it loses some energy as x-rays, {{every time it}} changes speed. The electron spins faster <b>and</b> <b>tighter</b> in denser fields, as it enters the MaGrid. Inside the MaGrid, single electrons travel straight through the null point, due to their infinite gyroradius in regions of no magnetic field. Next, they head towards {{the edges of the}} MaGrid field and corkscrew tighter along the denser magnetic field lines. This is typical electron cyclotron resonance motion. Their gyroradius shrinks and when they hit a dense magnetic field they can be reflected using the magnetic mirror effect. Electron trapping has been measured in polywells with Langmuir probes.|$|E
25|$|Following an {{investigation}} into recruiting violations in the men's basketball and football programs in 2011, on July 31, 2012, the NCAA announced sanctions – in addition to penalties UCF had previously self-imposed. The NCAA imposed a one-year postseason football ban. The penalty was {{in addition to a}} $50,000 fine, adding two years to UCF's previously proposed three years' probation, reduction of football scholarships, <b>and</b> <b>tighter</b> limits of football recruiting visiting days. In 2012, the Knights finished 10–4 and won their fourth C-USA East Division championship, though they would fall 33–27 in overtime to Tulsa in the league title game. UCF would play in the 2012 Beef 'O' Brady's Bowl and win 38-17 over Ball State as quarterback Blake Bortles would be named the game's MVP after throwing four touchdown passes.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, fashion had {{moved away from}} the unkempt hippie look and overdressed disco style of the late 1970s. Athletic clothes were more popular than jeans during this period, as were more subdued colors. Popular colors were black, white, indigo, forest green, burgundy, and {{different}} shades of browns, tans, and oranges. Velour, velvet, and polyester were popular fabrics used in clothes, especially button-up and v-neck shirts. Looser pants remained popular during this time, being fairly wide but straight, <b>and</b> <b>tighter</b> shirts were especially popular. The general public, at this time, wanted to wear low-maintenance clothing with more basic colors, as the global recession going on at the time kept extravagant clothes out of reach. Also worn were striped tube socks sometimes worn with the top folded over worn with shorts. It was not uncommon to see parents especially fathers wearing these along with their kids.|$|E
25|$|Dan Patch next {{tackled the}} record for one mile on a half-mile track. Because the horse must {{negotiate}} more <b>and</b> <b>tighter</b> turns on a smaller track, the half-mile track record is slower than the time on a one-mile track. Even today, separate records are kept in harness racing depending on the track dimensions. On September 7 at the half-mile track in Lima, Ohio, Dan Patch paced a world record of 2:04, {{only to have the}} record broken by Prince Alert a few weeks later. Prince Alert then lowered the world record on a one-mile track to an astonishing 1:57, thanks in part to perfect weather conditions but also aided by a large canvas sail carried between the galloping horses who set the pace. Critics pointed out that the sail, later referred to as a wind shield, lessened the wind resistance that a horse faced (similar to drafting in cycling or motor racing). Although the usage of wind shields was eventually disallowed by the American Trotting Register, in the short term it meant that Dan Patch was no longer the fastest horse in the world.|$|E
25|$|After {{almost a}} year away from the Test arena, Hughes found himself back in the Test side for the series against Sri Lanka {{in lieu of the}} {{retiring}} Ricky Ponting, occupying the number 3 position over Watson. Immediately he made an impact, scoring a solid 86 in the first Test match at Hobart, with a new-found confidence <b>and</b> <b>tighter</b> technique that had eluded him 12 months prior. He made two half centuries during his comeback scoring 233 runs at 46.60 in what was the most successful stint at the number 3 spot that the Australians had seen for some time. Hughes was set to receive a $1 million contract with Cricket Australia and be selected in Australia's ODI and T20 international squads in the wake of Michael Hussey's international retirement {{at the end of the}} 2012/13 Australia summer. Hughes' selection in the Australian ODI squad was confirmed on 6 January 2013. National selection boss John Inverarity noted that players such as Hughes were included with an eye to the 2015 World Cup, suggesting that he was viewed as a long-term player for Australia in all three forms of the game.|$|E
