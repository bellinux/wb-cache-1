25|$|Eclecticism is {{not open}} to the {{superficial}} objection of proceeding without a system or test in determining the complete or incomplete. But it is open to objection, assuming that a particular analysis of consciousness has reached all the possible elements in humanity and in history, and all their combinations. It may be asked, Can history have that which {{is not in the}} individual consciousness? In a sense not; but our analysis may not give all that is there, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> not at once to impose that analysis or any formula on history. History is as likely to reveal to us in the first place true and original elements, and combinations of elements in man, as a study of consciousness. Besides, the tendency of applying a formula of this sort to history is to assume that the elements are developed in a certain regular or necessary order, whereas this may not at all be the case; but we may find at any epoch the whole mixed, either crossing or co-operative, as in the consciousness of the individual himself. Further, the question as to how these elements may possibly have grown up in the general consciousness of mankind is assumed to be nonexistent or impossible.|$|E

This, for me, is a message of greatest importance. It is a message that leads to overcoming what could be considered the great temptation of our times: the pretense that after the 'Big Bang' God retired from history.|$|E

They were invited to dine with General Creighton Abrams, the then commander of all forces in Vietnam, whom Cronkite knew from World War II. According to Leiser, Abrams told Cronkite, [...] "we cannot win this Goddamned war, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> to find a dignified way out." ...|$|E

5000|$|Consequentia mirabilis was {{a pattern}} of {{argument}} popular in 17th century Europe that first appeared in a fragment of Aristotle's Protrepticus: [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> to philosophise, then <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> to philosophise; <b>and</b> if <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> not to philosophise, then <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> to philosophise (i.e. {{in order to justify}} this view); in any case, therefore, <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> to philosophise." ...|$|R
2500|$|Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer of California {{drafted a}} similar {{amendment}} on September 20. The text condemned the Petraeus ad {{as well as}} a 2002 ad attacking then-Senator Max Cleland of Georgia during the 2002 midterm elections and the Swift Vets and POWs for Truth ads attacking John Kerry during the 2004 Presidential election. Democratic Senator Carl Levin of Michigan said, [...] "They're all disgraceful ads <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> to treat them the same way". The vote was 50-47 in favor, but since 60 votes were required to pass it, the amendment did not carry.|$|E
2500|$|United States Surgeon General David Satcher in 2001 {{issued a}} report stating that [...] "there is no valid {{scientific}} evidence that sexual orientation can be changed". The same year, a study by Robert Spitzer concluded that some highly motivated individuals whose orientation is predominantly homosexual can become predominantly heterosexual with some form of reparative therapy. Spitzer based his findings on structured interviews with 200 self-selected individuals (143 males, 57 females). He told The Washington Post that the study [...] "shows some people can change from gay to straight, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> to acknowledge that". Spitzer's study caused controversy and attracted media attention. Spitzer recanted his study in 2012, and apologized to the gay community for making unproven claims of the efficacy of reparative therapy, calling it his only professional regret.|$|E
2500|$|At 10:00am, October 28, Kennedy {{first learned}} of Khrushchev's {{solution}} to the crisis to remove the 15 Jupiters in Turkey and the Soviets would remove the rockets from Cuba. Khrushchev had made the offer in a public statement {{for the world to}} hear. Despite almost solid opposition from his senior advisers, Kennedy quickly embraced the Soviet offer. [...] "This is a pretty good play of his," [...] Kennedy said, according to a tape recording that he made secretly of the Cabinet Room meeting. Kennedy had deployed the Jupiters in March of the year, causing a stream of angry outbursts from Khrushchev. [...] "Most people will think this is a rather even trade <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> to take advantage of it," [...] Kennedy said. Vice President Lyndon Johnson was the first to endorse the missile swap but others continued to oppose the offer. Finally, Kennedy ended the debate. [...] "We can't very well invade Cuba with all its toil and blood," [...] Kennedy said, [...] "when we could have gotten them out by making a deal on the same missiles on Turkey. If that's part of the record, then you don't have a very good war." ...|$|E
