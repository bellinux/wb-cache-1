5|$|Articles 87 through 89 of the Constitution {{deal with}} how the {{presidency}} can change hands in-between election cycles. The President {{has the ability to}} resign from office at any time under Article 87. The letter of resignation is sent to the House of Representatives and is accepted by them. The President has the ability to be removed from office if his physical or mental health is impaired under Article 88. In order for this to happen, <b>a</b> <b>two-thirds</b> <b>majority</b> must be reached in the House of Representatives and the Council of the Republic on the resolution to remove the President. An ad hoc committee is formed and must make the determination about the state of health before any motion can begin. If the President has committed a grave crime, such as treason, one-third of the House must bring charges against the President formally. The investigation of the charges will be conducted by the Council of the Republic. In order to evict the President from office, <b>a</b> <b>two-thirds</b> <b>majority</b> is needed to vote in favor of conviction. The criminal case is further sent to the Supreme Court for review. The actions of either option must occur one month after the resolution is passed or the action will be considered void by the Constitution.|$|E

5|$|As of November 2015, a {{majority}} of seats in the Maryland Senate are held {{by members of the}} Democratic Party, with 33 Democrats and 14 Republicans, greater than <b>a</b> <b>two-thirds</b> <b>majority.</b> This dominance is nothing new, as Democrats have had strong majorities in the chamber for decades. Democrats tend to control seats in the large population centers such as Baltimore City, Montgomery County, and Prince George's County, while Republicans control most seats on the Eastern Shore and in western Maryland. The chamber has also had significant numbers of women and African-Americans serve, with women averaging around 30% of the seats and African-Americans around 20%.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated {{by their}} defeats in the judiciary, the Relief Party turned its {{attention}} to the gubernatorial election of 1824, where they backed General Joseph Desha. Desha's election by the overwhelming vote of 38,37822,499 was seen by the party as a mandate to pursue the relief agenda. An early proposal to reduce the salaries of the Court of Appeals justices to 25 cents per year was discarded without a vote, but the House of Representatives mustered the votes to remove the offending justices. The justices were spared removal when the Senate failed to pass the measure with <b>a</b> <b>two-thirds</b> <b>majority.</b> The vote was 2312.|$|E

5|$|The {{members of}} the Presidential Council are not elected, but {{appointed}} by the President on advice of the Cabinet. No public nomination process or vote is stipulated in the Constitution. The President, {{if he does not}} concur with the Cabinet, may veto the appointment. However, he is required to consult the Council of Presidential Advisers ("CPA"), a constitutional body that advises the President on appointments of key public officials and matters relating to Singapore's financial reserves. If he exercises his veto without the CPA's concurrence, Parliament may overrule his decision with a resolution passed with <b>a</b> <b>two-thirds</b> <b>majority</b> vote. The President has no power to remove current members.|$|E

Examples of important questions include recommendations on peace and security; election of members to organs; admission, suspension, and expulsion of members; and budgetary matters. All other questions are decided {{by a majority}} vote. Each member country has one vote. Apart from approval of budgetary matters, resolutions are not binding on the members. The Assembly may make recommendations on any matters {{within the scope of}} the UN, except matters of peace and security that are under consideration by the Security Council.|$|E
5|$|When the {{convention}} concluded, Ross returned home {{and spent the}} next four years focusing on his farm. In 1880, he became an accidental candidate for Texas State Senator from the 22nd District. The nominating convention deadlocked between two candidates, with neither receiving <b>a</b> <b>two-thirds</b> <b>majority.</b> As a compromise, one of the delegates suggested the group nominate Ross. Although no one asked Ross whether he wanted to run for office, the delegates elected him as their candidate. He agreed to the nomination to spare the trouble and expense of another convention.|$|E

5|$|A {{competition}} {{for a new}} flag, held in June 2007, received 993 entries. Under the terms of UN talks, all such symbols would have to reflect the multi-ethnic nature of Kosovo, avoiding {{the use of the}} Albanian or Serbian double-headed eagles or the use of solely red and black or red, blue and white color schemes. Red and black are the colours used on the Albanian flag; red, blue and white are the main colours used on the Serbian flag. Additionally, all entries had to be rectangular and have a 2:3 proportion. The Kosovo Symbols Commission eventually selected three designs, which were then voted on by the Assembly of Kosovo (with <b>a</b> <b>two-thirds</b> <b>majority</b> required for approval), when independence was declared after the status talks. The three proposals selected were forwarded to the Assembly on 4 February 2008.|$|E
5|$|As {{a treaty}} {{document}} {{with a foreign}} nation, the Tyler-Texas annexation treaty required the support of <b>a</b> <b>two-thirds</b> <b>majority</b> in the Senate for passage. But in fact, when the Senate voted on the measure on June 8, 1844, fully two-thirds voted against the treaty (16–35). The vote went largely along party lines: Whigs had opposed it almost unanimously (1–27), while Democrats split, but voted overwhelmingly in favor (15–8). The election campaign had hardened partisan positions on Texas among Democrats. Tyler had anticipated that the measure would fail, due largely to the divisive effects of Secretary Calhoun's Packenham letter. Undeterred, he formally asked the House of Representatives to consider other constitutional means to authorize passage of the treaty. Congress adjourned before debating the matter.|$|E
5|$|As the House of Councillors can veto a {{decision}} made by the House of Representatives, the House of Councillors can cause the House of Representatives to reconsider its decision. The House of Representatives however, can still insist on its decision by overwriting the veto by the House of Councillors with <b>a</b> <b>two-thirds</b> <b>majority</b> of its members present. Each year, and when required, the National Diet is convoked at the House of Councillors, {{on the advice of}} the Cabinet, for an extra or an ordinary session, by the Emperor. A short speech is, however, usually first made by the Speaker of the House of Representatives before the Emperor proceeds to convoke the Diet with his Speech from the throne.|$|E

During such revisions, sports can be excluded or included in the programme on the basis of <b>a</b> <b>two-thirds</b> <b>majority</b> vote {{of the members of the}} IOC.

5|$|Quwatli {{returned}} to Syria in 1955, following {{the ouster of}} President Adib al-Shishakli and during the presidency of Hashim al-Atassi. Quwatli entered his candidacy in the August 1955 presidential elections, {{at the age of}} 63. Required to secure <b>a</b> <b>two-thirds</b> <b>majority</b> in the 142-member Syrian Parliament in order to win, Quwatli defeated his main opponent Khalid al-Azm 89 to 42 (a further six votes were cast as invalid) in the first round. This prompted a second round of voting, in which Quwatli won the presidency with 91 votes against Azm's 41 (a further five votes were blank and two invalid.) Quwatli's bid for the presidency was supported by the governments of Egypt and Saudi Arabia, both of which were allied in their opposition to the Baghdad Pact as was Quwatli.|$|E
5|$|The 1974 Congressional midterm {{elections}} took place {{less than three}} months after Ford assumed office and {{in the wake of the}} Watergate scandal. The Democratic Party turned voter dissatisfaction into large gains in the House elections, taking 49 seats from the Republican Party, increasing their majority to 291 of the 435 seats. This was one more than the number needed (290) for <b>a</b> <b>two-thirds</b> <b>majority,</b> the number necessary to override a Presidential veto or to propose a constitutional amendment. Perhaps due in part to this fact, the 94th Congress overrode the highest percentage of vetoes since Andrew Johnson was President of the United States (1865–1869). Even Ford's former, reliably Republican House seat was won by a Democrat, Richard Vander Veen, who defeated Robert VanderLaan. In the Senate elections, the Democratic majority became 61 in the 100-seat body.|$|E

Because a state reform requires <b>a</b> <b>two-third</b> <b>majority,</b> the green parties (Groen/Ecolo) participated in these negotiations but were not part of the government coalition.|$|R
