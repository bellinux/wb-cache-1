5|$|Caragiale's legal {{representative}} was the fellow writer Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea, who systematically disproved Caion's allegations, {{and noted that}} the absentee defendant was guilty of numerous forgeries. He also convinced the judge that the similarities between Năpasta and The Power of Darkness were superficial. The court found Ionescu-Caion guilty of slander. He was sentenced to a three-month jail term, a 500 lei fine and 10,000 lei in court costs. However, he appealed the tribunal's decision. The jury selection was a laborious process: Caion's lawyer Danielopol recused writers Nicolae Iorga and Ovid Densusianu, alleging that all Romanian literati had <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> to defend plagiarism. Iorga took offense, and reportedly challenged Danielopol to a duel. During the proceedings, Caion backed up on the original accusations, explaining that he had only invented a reason to bring Caragiale in for a trial. The court eventually acquitted Caion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Wallace was {{drawn into the}} debate over {{mandatory}} smallpox vaccination. Wallace originally saw the issue {{as a matter of}} personal liberty; but, after studying some of the statistics provided by anti-vaccination activists, he began to question the efficacy of vaccination. At the time, the germ theory of disease was very new and far from universally accepted. Moreover, no one knew enough about the human immune system to understand why vaccination worked. When Wallace did some research, he discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable, in a few cases completely phony, statistics to support their arguments. Always suspicious of authority, Wallace suspected that physicians had <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> in promoting vaccination, and became convinced that reductions in the incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were, in fact, due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation.|$|E

The issue escalated with the captain's brother, Widerøe's chief pilot John Hovring, stating that the crash must have occurred as a result of a collision with a fighter or missile.

30|$|Another type of {{evidence}} that does not address program effects comes from surveys of employers or program administrators. Pavetti et al.

Roder and Elliott (2013) conducted a telephone survey of employers {{who took part in}} job subsidy programs in three states and report that 63  % said they created new positions in order to hire the subsidized workers. Of course, employers may have <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> <b>interested</b> in giving <b>a</b> positive assessment of a program that is to their financial advantage.|$|R
40|$|The {{allocation}} of scarce {{health care service}} resources often requires trade-offs between individual and collective outcomes (e. g., when some individuals benefit more strongly from a given policy than others). Based on construal level theory, {{one would expect that}} consumers cognitively represent the individual and collective outcomes of an allocation policy at different levels of abstraction and that they evaluate allocation policies more positively when there is congruency between the cognitive representation of the policy’s focal outcome and the spatial and temporal distance inherently present in the policy’s decision context (e. g., allocation decisions on a future policy). However, we hypothesize that this congruency effect can be overruled by <b>a</b> high <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> mindset that is activated by an individual’s recent personal experience with a health care service provider. Since <b>a</b> high <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> mindset increases the relevance of the allocation policy implementation for the individual because s/he perceives strong personal consequences, we propose that for consumers with recent experience the evaluation of an allocation policy that focuses on individual outcomes is higher than that of a policy that focuses on collective outcomes irrespective of the spatial and temporal distance in the decision context. Results of a hypothetical experiment among a representative sample of the general population confirm the congruency effects in the new domain of health care service allocation policies, and provide support for the proposed overruling effect of the activation of <b>a</b> high <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> mindset by recent personal experience on spatial and temporal distance...|$|R

Salleh demanded to be tried by peers of equal standing – retired Lord presidents, if need be. He also demanded that the tribunal make its hearings public. All of these claims were rejected by the tribunal, and Salleh withdrew from the proceedings.|$|E
25|$|When Ronald Reagan {{was elected}} in 1982, he {{significantly}} reduced the size and cost of many portions of government, thereby greatly limiting the Civil Service Reform Act. Satisfying {{the need for new}} legislation, the Performance Management and Recognition System (PMRS) was enacted on November 8, 1984. Most notably, the PMRS provided a greater level of evaluation accuracy and imposed minimum and maximum levels of pay increase to limit disparity among merit pay employees. PMRS also created Performance Standard Review Boards for each department and required that {{at least half of the}} board be members who were under the merit pay system.

As Route 46, the new road gathered ever more attention the further south it progressed. The Royal Thai Government worried it might be extended across trackless northwestern Laos to the Thai border. The presence of 25,000 Chinese troops and 400 antiaircraft guns along the new road raised anxiety {{not only in the}} Thai and Lao governments, but also in Washington.

Furthermore, Okubo’s record of the internment of 120, 000 Japanese Americans during World War II can be usefully read and taught as an autoethnography that constructs a counterhistory of World War II. The juxtaposition of Okubo’s autobiographical record of her internment experience {{with a variety of}} “official” images can help students learn about the construction of knowledge.

25|$|Fortna {{argues that}} peacekeepers have a {{positive}} impact on the peace process, despite often being sent to places where peace is most difficult to achieve. Peacekeeping is often looked at by detractors as ineffective, or unnecessary. Peace prevails when belligerents already have <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> in sustaining peace and therefore it could be argued that Peacekeepers play only a minor role in creating a strong foundation for enduring peace. Yet these causal reasons illustrate the important roles that Peacekeepers play in ensuring that peace lasts, especially when contrasted against situations in which belligerents are left to their own devices. These causal reasons thus illustrate the need for Peacekeeping and lay a foundation for the manner in which Peacekeeping operations can have a substantive impact on the post-conflict environment.|$|E
