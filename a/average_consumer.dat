25|$|Battery cages are the {{predominant}} form of housing for laying hens worldwide; these cages reduce aggression and cannibalism among hens, but are barren, restrict movement, and increase rates of osteoporosis. In these systems and in free-range egg production, unwanted male chicks are culled and killed at birth {{during the process}} of securing a further generation of egg-laying hens. It is estimated that an <b>average</b> <b>consumer</b> of eggs who eats 200 eggs per year for 70 years of his or her life is {{responsible for the deaths of}} 140 birds, and that an <b>average</b> <b>consumer</b> of milk who drinks 190kg per year for 70 years is responsible for the deaths of 2.5 cows.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of a responsible multinational firm's decision to enter {{in a foreign country}} either through exports or through foreign direct investment (FDI), as well as the relevant market and societal outcomes. We find that CSR investments are higher under FDI than under exports. The multinational firm's incentives to serve the foreign country through FDI are increasing in the <b>average</b> <b>consumer's</b> valuation for CSR and in the intensity of the foreign country's market competition, but only if the <b>average</b> <b>consumer's</b> valuation for CSR in this country is sufficiently high. These incentives are mitigated by the multinational firm's liability in this country under exports. We also find that there is misalignment of preferences between the stakeholders of the two countries over the multinational firm's mode of entry in the foreign country...|$|R

25|$|The {{recession}} {{of the early}} 1990s impacted on the average household budget, and affected the amount of disposable income that the <b>average</b> <b>consumer</b> had to spend, and with rising inflation it hit Asda customers whose stores were more heavily concentrated in the north than in the more affluent south east harder. The move upmarket had also pushed in-store service and labour costs up which impacted on profit margins and sales.|$|E
25|$|Under Bill C-60, photographers {{commissioned}} to take photographs were to retain {{ownership of the}} copyright of these photographs. This change came {{as an attempt to}} generalize the treatment of authors under the act; in the existing act, photographers were treated differently. This made sense for corporate commissioning, giving the photographer substantial bargaining power. However, for the <b>average</b> <b>consumer,</b> the provisions removed rights, and control over the use, duplication, distribution, display, and derivations of such commissioned works were greatly compromised.|$|E
25|$|Early theorists such {{as these}} saw no agency {{whatsoever}} for audiences of the culture industry, claiming instead that this industry was founded on mass deception and that the <b>average</b> <b>consumer</b> was a cultural dupe being inculcated into {{the values of the}} ruling classes without realizing it. Many critics of this school feel that this represented a reintroduction of Marx’s ideas about mediation, or media as purveyors of a dominant ideology that destroyed the possibility that audiences for mass media were able to work against these ruling ideas.|$|E
5000|$|Social media use in {{the fashion}} {{industry}} has enabled <b>average</b> <b>consumers</b> and regular people to have much more interaction with fashion designers and high-end clothing, shoes and accessory firms. Unlike traditional advertising platforms, such as billboard ads, magazine ads and television commercials, which the fashion company and their advertising agency had complete control over, when fashion companies do a social media marketing campaign in the 2010s, <b>average</b> <b>consumers</b> and regular people can post online comments immediately below the fashion company's social media advertisement. This accessibility {{is due to the}} increased usage of social media since 2009. Social media is a real time platform that reaches across the globe; this has had a great impact on how consumers interact with the fashion industry. Social media has brought about new channels of advertising for fashion houses to reach their target markets.|$|R

25|$|Churn or Customer {{attrition}} {{is often}} used {{as an indicator of}} customer satisfaction. However the churn rate can be kept artificially low by making it difficult for the customers to resiliate their services. This can include ignoring resiliations requests, implementing lengthy and complicated resiliation procedures to follow through by an <b>average</b> <b>consumer</b> and various other barriers to resiliation. Thus, churn can improve while customer satisfaction deteriorates. This practice is short sighted and will backfire. However, it was shown to be common in telephone companies and among internet providers.|$|E
25|$|Acetaldehyde is {{also created}} by thermal {{degradation}} or ultraviolet photo-degradation of some thermoplastic polymers {{during or after}} manufacture. One common example occurs when {{a bottle of water}} is left in a hot car for a few hours on a hot, sunny day, and one notices its strange sweet taste in the water from the breakdown of the polyethylene terephthalate (PETE) container. The water industry generally recognizes 20–40 ppb as the taste/odor threshold for acetaldehyde. The level at which an <b>average</b> <b>consumer</b> could detect acetaldehyde is still considerably lower than any toxicity.|$|E
25|$|The table below {{illustrates}} {{the capacity of}} a light rail train (the Siemens S70) {{compared to that of}} a standard car with five seats. The average length of a standard five-seat car is about 4.74 metres. The length of a Siemens S70 light rail vehicle is 27.7 meters, approximately the same length as 5.8 cars. The maximum occupancy of a five-seat automobile car is five people. The maximum capacity of the Siemens S70 is 220 people. This means that one metre in a car has a capacity of one person and one metre in a light rail vehicle has a capacity of almost eight persons, so the capacity of light rail is about eight times as high as that of an <b>average</b> <b>consumer</b> car, if only the length of the vehicles is taken into consideration. The average width of an automobile is about 1.77 metres, while the average width of the Siemens S70 is about 2.7 metres. The area of an <b>average</b> <b>consumer</b> car is about 8.4m², while the area taken up by a light rail car is about 74.8m². In an automobile car, each square metre has room for only 0.6 persons, while each square metre in a light rail car has room for 2.9 persons. This means that a light rail vehicle is significantly more capacity-effective than a consumer car is. Height is not taken into consideration, because it is not normally a problem given minimum-clearance regulations for underpasses.|$|E
5000|$|The {{case for}} a la carte has {{centered}} on cost savings for subscribers. In 2006, Kevin Martin, then chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) {{and one of the}} best known advocates for the pricing scheme, presented a report to Congress arguing that, on <b>average,</b> <b>consumers</b> would save 13% on their monthly cable subscription rates if they were able to subscribe only to channels that they actually watched.|$|R

30|$|Catchwords like scalability, {{on demand}} self service, pay per use, {{availability}} everywhere and any time describe {{an even bigger}} catchword: cloud computing. Cloud computing has evolved from technologies like utility and grid computing or the Internet of services. The progress {{in the area of}} virtualization and the availability of broadband Internet connections even for <b>average</b> <b>consumers</b> enabled cloud computing. It allows the outsourcing of computing and storage and involves the renting of virtualized hardware as well as of software running on it.|$|R
25|$|There are {{two types}} of hybrid formats which contain {{standard}} DVD-Video format video for playback in regular DVD players, and HD DVD video for playback in high definition on HD DVD players. The Combo disc is a dual sided disc with one side DVD and the other HD DVD, each of which can have up to two layers. The Twin disc is a single sided disc that can have up to three layers, with up to two layers dedicated to either DVD or HD DVD. These hybrid discs make retail marketing and shelf space management easier. Another advantage is hardware cross-compatibility. The <b>average</b> <b>consumer</b> does {{not have to worry about}} whether or not they can play a hybrid DVD: any standard home DVD player can access the DVD-encoded content and any HD DVD player can access both the DVD- and HD DVD-encoded content.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{alternative}} to using BlackBerry Enterprise Server {{is to use}} the BlackBerry Internet Service (BIS). BlackBerry Internet Service is available in 91 countries internationally. BlackBerry Internet Service was developed primarily for the <b>average</b> <b>consumer</b> rather than for the business consumer. The service allows users to access POP3, IMAP, and Outlook Web App (not via Exchange ActiveSync) email accounts without connecting through a BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES). BlackBerry Internet Service allows up to 10 email accounts to be accessed, including proprietary as well as public email accounts (such as Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo and AOL). BlackBerry Internet Service also supports the push capabilities of various other BlackBerry Applications. Various applications developed by RIM for BlackBerry utilise the push capabilities of BIS, such as the Instant Messaging clients (like Google Talk, Windows Live Messenger and Yahoo Messenger). The MMS, PIN, interactive gaming, mapping and trading applications require data plans like BIS (not just Wi-Fi) for use. The service is usually provisioned through a mobile phone service provider, though BlackBerry actually runs the service.|$|E

30|$|As {{any other}} research, the study has {{limitations}} and, thus, future research opportunities. First, this experiment {{was conducted in}} a controlled laboratory environment. Certainly, {{this is not a}} normal, natural setting where <b>average</b> <b>consumers</b> read other consumers’ feedback on certain firms or businesses. However, because the study used the differences of participants’ heart rates between the experiment period and the baseline period, it was expected that any discrepancies caused by nervousness or anxiety could have been removed. Thus, interpretation of the study findings must be done with caution.|$|R

In {{an interview with}} Associated Press columnist Suzanne Gamboa, Republican Senator Phil Gramm of Texas described United States currency as [...] "crummy". Gramm, {{who was one of}} the senators who voted for the bill containing the legislation that authorized it, praised the design of the Sacagawea dollar as being an improvement over the other coin designs then in production. Despite his praise of the design, Gramm condemned the Mint's approach to marketing the coin, stating that if the United States Mint were the Franklin Mint, they would be [...] "sued for deceptive advertisement." [...] He also noted his belief that the Mint had repeated the earlier mistakes of the Susan B. Anthony dollar by issuing a coin that was tailored to the requests of the vending machine industry rather than the <b>average</b> <b>consumer.</b> Texas Republican Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison criticized both the Sacagawea design as well the coin's size in relation to the other coins in circulation at the time. Hutchison felt that the new coin lacked the necessary heft to easily distinguish it from the lower denominations, and that the dollar, as well as the other coins and currency then in circulation [...] "looks like play money." [...] Senators Mike DeWine of Ohio and Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, Republican and Democrat respectively, praised the design and the distinctiveness of the golden color.|$|E

However, since most online bidders are <b>average</b> <b>consumers</b> instead of professional bidders, we suspect that online bidders are a heterogeneous group. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to explore the types of online bidders based on their real bidding behaviors in a popular auction site. A cluster analysis is employed and four types of online bidders are finally identified in a private value auction, namely, goal-driven bidders, experiential bidders, playful bidders, and opportunistic bidders. The profile and performance of each group are also discussed...|$|R
