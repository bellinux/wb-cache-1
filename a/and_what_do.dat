5|$|Feynman was a keen popularizer {{of physics}} through both books and lectures, {{including}} a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom, and the three-volume {{publication of his}} undergraduate lectures, The Feynman Lectures on Physics. Feynman also became known through his semi-autobiographical books Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! <b>and</b> <b>What</b> <b>Do</b> You Care What Other People Think? and books written about him, such as Tuva or Bust! and Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman by James Gleick.|$|E

25|$|The broader {{political}} {{context of the}} debate is the longstanding conflict between more and less local institutions: tribes against states, villages against cities, local communities against empires, nation-states against the UN. The relative strength of the local versus the global has waxed and waned over recorded history. From the early modern period until the twentieth century, the preeminent political institution was the state, which is sovereign, territorial, claims a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence in its territory, and exists in an international system of other sovereign states. Over the same period, and relatedly, political philosophers' interest in justice focused almost exclusively on domestic issues: how should states treat their subjects, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> fellow-citizens owe one another? Justice in relations between states, and between individuals across state borders was put aside as a secondary issue or left to international relations theorists.|$|E

2500|$|During {{a lecture}} on {{autobiography}} and fiction, Franzen discussed four perennial questions often asked to him by audiences, all of which annoy him or bother him in some way. These are: (1) Who are your influences? (2) What time of day do you work, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> you write on? (3) I read an interview with an author who says that, {{at a certain point}} in writing a novel, the characters [...] "take over" [...] and tell him what to do. Does this happen to you, too? (4) Is your fiction autobiographical? In the lecture he said of the third question in particular [...] "This one always raises my blood pressure" [...] and quoted Nabokov in response.|$|E
2500|$|Following [...] "the {{cinematic}} rumination {{on modern}} marriage begun by Cecil B.

Too Wise Wives, <b>and</b> <b>What</b> <b>Do</b> Men Want? However, as the United States entered the Jazz Age in the 1920s, Weber, {{came to be seen}} as passé, in part because of her [...] "propensity for didacticism", but also because her [...] "values became increasingly archaic; her moralising, propagandistic tone was unsuited to the era of the 'flapper' girl and a hedonism that seemed all the more urgent".|$|E

[...] Ali immediately retorted, [...] "While fat Arabs rest in soft beds, the Iranians work hard on the hottest days to please God with their efforts. <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> these Arabs want from me? To ostracize the Iranians and become an oppressor!

2500|$|After Ott {{become the}} {{ambassador}} to Japan in April 1938, Sorge had a breakfast with him everyday {{where the two}} discussed in detail German-Japanese relations, and Sorge sometimes drafted the cables that Ott sent under his name to Berlin. Ott trusted Sorge {{so much that he}} sent him out as a German courier to carry secret messages to the German consulates in Canton, Hong Kong, and Manila. Sorge himself noted about his influence in the German Embassy: [...] "They would come to me and say, 'we have found out such and such a thing, have you heard about it <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> you think?'". Of all of Sorge's various relationships with women, the most durable and lastingly was with a Japanese woman Hanako Ishii who tried to curb Sorge's heavy drinking and his habit of recklessly riding his motorcycle around the Japanese countryside in a manner that everyone viewed as almost suicidal.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a spring}} 2014 {{interview}} with the BBC about the then forthcoming reissue of Led Zeppelin's first three albums, Page said he was confident fans would be keen on another reunion show, but Plant later replied that [...] "the chances of it happening [...] zero." [...] Page then told The New York Times that he was [...] "fed up" [...] with Plant's refusal to play, stating [...] "I was told last year that Robert Plant said he is doing nothing in 2014, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> the other two guys think? Well, he knows what the other guys think. Everyone would love to play more concerts for the band. He's just playing games, and I'm fed up with it, {{to be honest with}} you.

2500|$|In {{his book}} [...] "Wrestling with Zion," [...] {{he urged the}} Jews [...] "not to provoke the anger of the native people by doing them wrong...we should be {{cautious}} in our dealings with a foreign people among whom we returned to live, to handle these people with love and respect and, needless to say, with justice and good judgment. [...] <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> our brothers do? [...] Exactly the opposite! [...] They were slaves in their Diasporas, and suddenly they find themselves with unlimited freedom, wild freedom that only a country like Turkey [...] can offer. [...] This sudden change has planted despotic tendencies in their hearts, as always happens to former slaves [...] [...] They deal with the Arabs with hostility and cruelty, trespass unjustly, beat them shamefully for no sufficient reason, and even boast about their actions. [...] There is no one to stop the flood {{and put an end}} to this despicable and dangerous tendency. [...] Our brothers indeed were right when they said that the Arab only respects he who exhibits bravery and courage. [...] But when these people feel that the law is on their rival's side and, even more so, if they are right to think their rival's actions are unjust and oppressive, then, even if they are silent and endlessly reserved, they keep their anger in their hearts. And these people will be revengeful like no other.|$|E

2500|$|The apparitions of Our Lady of Good Help were {{reported}} by Adele Brise in 1859. In December 2010, Bishop David L. Ricken of Green Bay, Wisconsin approved the apparition as worthy of belief, as the first Marian apparition approved in the United States at the local level. In Robinsonville (now called Champion) WI, a young Belgian immigrant woman named Adele Brise was walking through a wooded area when she saw a beautiful woman standing between a maple and a hemlock tree. She saw the lady again {{on her way to}} Mass, and walked past her again. After Mass she told her priest about the apparition, and he told her to ask the Lady [...] "In God's name, who are you <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> you want of me?" [...] When Adele walked past the spot again, the Lady was there, and Adele asked what she was told by the priest. The Lady replied, [...] "I am the Queen of Heaven who prays for the conversion of sinners." [...] She gave Adele the mission to teach the children of the area their Catechism, which Adele did faithfully. Soon after, Adele's father built a small chapel between the trees, and later two more churches were built on the spot before the present brick church, built in 1942. The apparitions, attributed to Our Lady of Good Help, were approved on December 8, 2010, by Bishop David L. Ricken of the Diocese of Green Bay.|$|E
