5|$|I was {{as student}} in the sixties, engaged {{in the civil rights}} movement, anti-Vietnam War protests. I'd come from New York to attend the University of Wisconsin. It was an {{exciting}} time. A lot of active students wound up in different cities and communities as organizers. I chose Racine, Wisconsin. I spent three years there. We had developed a legal clinic <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a whole health program, but the city was too small. I had, of course, heard about Uptown in Chicago, and the challenges. So I wound up here in 1976. I waited tables. I did photography, took pictures for attorneys. Ultimately we started our own print shop in order to print our own newspapers and magazines.|$|E
5|$|Yesterday, as my orderly {{was holding}} my horse, I asked {{him where he}} was from. He said he was from Hawaii! He {{proved to be a}} full-blood Kanaka, by the name of Kealoha, who came from the Islands last year. There is also another, by the name of Kaiwi, who lived near Judge Smith's, who left the Islands last July. I enjoyed seeing them very much <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a good jabber in kanaka. Kealoha is a private in the 41st Regiment US Colored Troops, and Kaiwi is a Private in the 28th U.S.C.T., in the pioneer corps. Both are good men and seemed glad to have seen me.|$|E
5|$|There {{was a scene}} were I {{was lying}} on the ground, {{appearing}} to be dead, in a Lodger-esque pose <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it… the first one we did, we started the film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere… the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.' You could see {{the other members of the}} band walking away and they had these weird outfits on, and they thought it was some kind of gang slaying.|$|E

25|$|Thence {{marched to}} Ironton, Missouri., {{to meet a}} rebel force under General Sterling Price. The foxy old fellow turned aside <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to return, and thence march into Western Missouri, in the vain attempt to meet the same rebel force. This march covered the {{distance}} of 700 miles going and returning {{to and from the}} vicinity of Kansas City. The weather was much of the time during the march, cold, and the ground rough and frozen, the shoes of the men worn out and much severe suffering was endured.|$|E
25|$|He {{thought it}} was me at first and chatted away quite happily to Dave, whose French was near enough non-existent. Well, {{it was not long}} before he sensed {{something}} was wrong and whipped the scarf off the poor lad's face. He stormed over to my cabin and dragged me out, half asleep, on to the track. That was that! He and the other officials kept their eyes on us after that <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> little chance of getting away with any more larks like that.|$|E
25|$|By {{the will}} of my {{commander}} in chief, I have come to release the ownership over the Talysh regions {{from the hands of}} the Persians and therefore must take Lankaran. Knowing you are a valiant and prudent leader, I consider it necessary to warn that your resistance will be in vain. Even though you may be a great military leader, but you are no better than Abbas Mirza, who lost at Aslanduz and with that ten thousand soldiers, 500 men as prisoners, all the banners, weapons of which the troops don't have to their disposal right now. As it was at Aslanduz, where here barely escaped along with the 20th horsemen regiment and fled to Tabriz, while he had thirty thousand men at his disposal, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> just two thousand men. Warriors of the great almighty in the world the Russian emperor crashed Abbas Mirza to pieces, and now they are located here, at the Talysh Khanate. So, when Abbas Mirza could not resist our victorious weapons, despite the fact that his troops outnumbered ours by fifteen times, you reflect that you won't be able either to inflict us a mortal blow here; so I suggest that you agree to voluntarily surrender the fortress to avoid harmful and unnecessary bloodshed, sparing both Abbas Mirza's as well as my warriors. Consider of what you will reach by following sanity, namely saving lives, dignity, and both your property and all affiliated parties' properties in this conflict; otherwise, you will lose everything, if you won't attend the voice of common sense. But it is my duty to tell you, as you will be the one to choose; only I shall be justified in front of God and humanity. I'm ordered not to bombard yet by this letter until I receive response and receipt within three hours.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And now {{you will}} {{naturally}} want to know, dearest Ma <b>and</b> Lavvy, how <b>we</b> live, <b>and</b> what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{got to live}} upon. Well! <b>And</b> so <b>we</b> live on Blackheath, in the charm--ingest of dolls' houses, de--lightfully furnished, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a clever little servant who is de--cidedly pretty, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> are economical <b>and</b> orderly, and do everything by clockwork, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a hundred <b>and</b> fifty pounds a year, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> all <b>we</b> want, <b>and</b> more. And lastly, {{if you would like}} to know in confidence, as perhaps you may, what is my opinion of my husband, my opinion is--that I almost love him!' ...|$|R

5000|$|The National MagLab also conducts monthly tours open to {{the public}} and hosts an annual open house with about 5,000 attendees. Special tour and {{outreach}} opportunities are also available to all local schools. In an interview on Skepticality, Dr. Scott Hannahs said, [...] "If you come by on the third Saturday in February I believe <b>we</b> <b>have</b> an open house <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> Tesla coils shooting sparks <b>and</b> <b>we</b> melt rocks in the geochemistry group <b>and</b> <b>we</b> measure the speed of sound <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> lasers <b>and</b> potato launchers <b>and</b> <b>we</b> just <b>have</b> all sorts of things showing little scientific principles <b>and</b> stuff. <b>We</b> get together <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> about 5,000 people show up to come and tour a physics lab which is a pretty amazing group of people." ...|$|R
500|$|I wanted {{something}} with a Motown feel. Mel C eventually finished off the chorus <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{the basis for a}} song called [...] "Stop". Later, when we had more time, the other girls came in and we helped write the verses and bridges.|$|E
500|$|In June 2013, Nomura {{stated that}} the {{original}} game assets for Kingdom Hearts had been lost some time ago. He explained, [...] " [...] was lost, {{so we had to}} research, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to dig out from the actual game what was available and recreate everything for HD. We had to recreate all the graphics and it was actually not that easy." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the match, Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier {{claimed he}} had a premonition that goalkeeper Dudek would be {{the hero of the}} final: [...] "I told Jerzy three days ago 'I can feel you will be the hero. You were too unlucky when we played them, today he was man of the match. But {{football}} can be like that. Sometimes you can be at the bottom and then be a hero again. I just had a feeling. I'm a great believer that when you have the right attitude everything else follows. He had a good run after the World Cup but then he made some mistakes <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to support him. The squad get on very well. There was no finger-pointing after that game. He has saved us before in games <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to keep faith in him." [...] Houllier also praised Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson: [...] "I wished him the best in the Champions League because he represents the best in English football, he congratulated every Liverpool player after the final whistle and that shows that he is not just a great manager but a great man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{we might}} be worse off in some respects, Dick. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> two good {{officers}} out of the four, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a very fair crew, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> good grub; <b>and</b> the company always victual their ships well, and don't put the officers' messing {{into the hands of}} the captain, as they do in some ships." ...|$|R

"Well, sir,--when we got home, I {{took out}} the medicines, but the pocket-book {{was nowhere to be}} found; and I have been back with James, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> looked all along the road, and under the hemlock-tree, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> inquired at the apothecary's; but we cannot find it any where." ...|$|R

500|$|Shooting on {{location}} in New York City also added to Mackendrick’s anxieties. Exteriors were shot in the busiest, noisiest areas with crowds of young Tony Curtis fans occasionally breaking through police barriers. Mackendrick remembered, [...] "We started shooting in Times Square at rush hour, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> high-powered actors and a camera crane and police help {{and all the rest}} of it, but we didn’t have any script. We knew where we were going vaguely, but that’s all".|$|E
500|$|Film author Patrick Webster {{considers}} Kubrick's {{methods of}} writing and developing scenes to fit with the classical auteur theory of directing, allowing collaboration and improvisation with the actors during filming. Malcolm McDowell recalled Kubrick's collaborative emphasis during their discussions and his willingness {{to allow him to}} improvise a scene, stating that [...] "there was a script and we followed it, but when it didn't work he knew it, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to keep rehearsing endlessly until we were bored with it".|$|E
500|$|I {{was very}} pleased it was made at all. ... There were people who said, 'I don't think we're going to do this', <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to wait months to get the green light. We thought, 'Well, we haven't got the budget we want, we haven't got the {{schedule}} we want, so we're {{going to have to}} make it as brilliant as we can.' It was a costume drama and it needed a costume drama budget, and it didn't get that.|$|E

We had fun. And so, if nothing else, it was a good experience... and diva-ism, whatever." ...|$|E
500|$|Starr said, [...] "We {{really looked}} {{out for each}} other <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> so many laughs together. In the old days we'd have the biggest hotel suites, the whole floor of the hotel, and the four of us would end up in the bathroom, just to be with each other". He added, [...] "there were some really loving, caring moments between four people: a hotel room here and there – a really amazing closeness. Just four guys who loved each other. It was pretty sensational." ...|$|E
500|$|Weta Digital {{took over}} duties for animating Iron Man during the forest duel from ILM. Guy Williams, Weta's visual effects supervisor, said, [...] "We shared assets {{back and forth}} with ILM, but our {{pipelines}} are unique and it's hard for other assets to plug into it. But in this case, we got their models <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to redo the texture spaces because the way we texture maps is different." [...] Williams said the most difficult part was re-creating Iron Man's reflective metal surfaces.|$|E

500|$|In January 1896 Yeats moved again, {{into a small}} flat in Woburn Place, {{so as to be}} {{nearer to}} her. Finally after a charged bed-buying session, with Yeats {{describing}} [...] "an embarrassed conversation upon the width", and his nervousness preventing them at first from becoming lovers, he eventually wrote in January 1896, [...] "at last she came to me in my thirtieth year.... <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> many days of happiness". Yeats' happiness is apparent in the poems he wrote at that period, and for the duration of their affair, Olivia appears to have acted as a muse to the poet.|$|E
500|$|Despite having {{finished}} the script in 1985, Joel explained, [...] "We couldn't make Hudsucker back then because we weren't that popular yet. Plus, the script {{was too expensive}} <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> just completed Blood Simple, which was an independent film." [...] After completing Barton Fink (1991), the Coens were looking forward to doing a more mainstream film. The Hudsucker Proxy was revived and the Coens and Raimi performed a brief rewrite. Producer Joel Silver, {{a fan of the}} Coens' previous films, acquired the script for his production company, Silver Pictures, and pitched the project at Warner Bros. Pictures. Silver also allowed the Coens complete artistic control.|$|E
500|$|Echo & the Bunnymen left London Records {{in early}} 2000. McCulloch said, [...] "What they said is, 'We'll {{keep you on}} if you don't take {{as much money as}} in the contract,' <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> no {{intention}} of staying anyway, so it was kind of 'were we pushed or did we fall?'" [...] There was also a change in the band's management with Toogood departing to start his own record label. With the session musicians who recorded What Are You Going to Do with Your Life? moving on, McCulloch and Sergeant recruited a new band, with whom they would go on to record the 2000 EP, Avalanche, which was only available to buy over the internet.|$|E
