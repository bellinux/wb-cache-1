Water buffalo horn is very suitable, as is horn of several antelopes such as gemsbok, oryx, ibex, and that of Hungarian grey cattle. Goat and sheep horn can also be used. Most forms of cow horn are not suitable, as they soon {{delaminate}} with use. The horn can store more energy than wood in compression.|$|E
5|$|The {{innermost}} {{layer of}} the heart is called the endocardium. It {{is made up of}} a lining of simple squamous epithelium, and covers heart chambers and valves. It is continuous with the endothelium of the veins and arteries of the heart, and is joined to the myocardium with <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> connective tissue. The endocardium, by secreting endothelins, may also play a role in regulating the contraction of the myocardium.|$|E
5|$|All whales have a {{thick layer}} of blubber. In species that live near the poles, the blubber can be as thick as 11 inches. This blubber can help with {{buoyancy}} (which is helpful for a 100-ton whale), protection to some extent as predators {{would have a hard time}} getting through {{a thick layer}} of fat, and energy for fasting when migrating to the equator; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. It can constitute as much as 50% of a whale's body weight. Calves are born with only <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.|$|E

5|$|Before the Rove sediments {{were laid}} down, during the Archean Eon, the Algoman orogeny added landmass along a border from South Dakota to the Lake Huron region; this {{boundary}} is the Great Lakes tectonic zone. Several million years later <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> hypervelocity impact ejecta from the Sudbury impact event was deposited on the older, underlying, Gunflint Iron Formation, and the Rove was then deposited {{on top of}} the ejecta; it is estimated that at ground zero the earthquake generated by the meteor impact would have registered 10.2 on the Richter scale.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, Walter Alvarez {{was doing}} {{geologic}} research in central Italy. There he had located an outcrop {{on the walls}} of a gorge whose limestone layers included strata both above and below the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary. Exactly at the boundary is <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> clay. Walter told his father that the layer marked where the dinosaurs and much else became extinct and that nobody knew why, or what the clay was about — it was a big mystery and he intended to solve it.|$|E
5|$|Microbial mats {{are areas}} of {{sediment}} stabilised {{by the presence}} of colonies of microbes that secrete sticky fluids or otherwise bind the sediment particles. They appear to migrate upwards when covered by <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> sediment but this is an illusion caused by the colony's growth; individuals do not, themselves, move. If too thick a layer of sediment is deposited before they can grow or reproduce through it, parts of the colony will die leaving behind fossils with a characteristically wrinkled ("elephant skin") and tubercular texture.|$|E

5|$|Molybdenum {{disulfide}} (MoS2) {{is used as}} a {{solid lubricant}} and a high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) antiwear agent. It forms strong films on metallic surfaces and is a common additive to HPHT greases — {{in the event of a}} catastrophic grease failure, <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> molybdenum prevents contact of the lubricated parts. It also has semiconducting properties with distinct advantages over traditional silicon or graphene in electronics applications. MoS2 is also used as a catalyst in hydrocracking of petroleum fractions containing nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen.|$|E
5|$|The design used <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> {{aluminum}} {{to protect}} the uranium from corrosion by the cooling water. Cylindrical uranium slugs with aluminum jackets would be pushed through channels through the reactor and drop {{out the other side}} into a cooling pond. Once the radioactivity subsided, the slugs would be taken away and the plutonium extracted. After reviewing the two designs, the DuPont engineers chose the water-cooled one. In 1959 a patent for the reactor design would be issued in the name of Creutz, Ohlinger, Weinberg, Wigner, and Young.|$|E
5|$|The spores {{are roughly}} elliptical, or, less commonly, {{somewhat}} spherical, and have dimensions of 7.5–9.5 by 5–7μm. They are thin-walled, inamyloid, {{and have a}} smooth surface. Each features a prominent hilar appendage. The basidia (spore-bearing cells), measuring 32–42 by 6–9μm, are club-shaped and four-spored, with sterigmata up to 7μm long. Cheilocystidia (cystidia found on the gill edges) are abundant, and measure 15–40 by 3–6μm; no pleurocystida (cystidia on the gill faces) are present. The cap cuticle comprises <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> 3–6μm-wide hyphae that are interwoven either loosely or tightly. All hyphae of O.nidiformis have clamp connections.|$|E

30|$|The {{lithology}} of {{the third}} petrofacies type is argillaceous siltstone and silty mudstone, which includes <b>a</b> <b>thinner</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> parallel bedding and small ripple lamination, indicating overall weaker hydrodynamic conditions. Interaction between sand and mud occurs from bottom to top, the clay content increases without any rhythm, and the shape of well logging curve is zigzag (Figs.  10 c, 11). Therefore, the integrated interpretation shows that the third type is the distal bar petrofacies.|$|R
5|$|At the {{opposite}} side of the planet, the solar wind stretches Jupiter's magnetic field lines into a long, trailing magnetotail, which sometimes extends well beyond the orbit of Saturn. The structure of Jupiter's magnetotail is similar to Earth's. It consists of two lobes (blue areas in the figure), with the magnetic field in the southern lobe pointing toward Jupiter, and that in the northern lobe pointing away from it. The lobes are separated by <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> plasma called the tail current sheet (orange layer in the middle). Like Earth's, the Jovian tail is a channel through which solar plasma enters the inner regions of the magnetosphere, where it is heated and forms the radiation belts at distances closer than 10RJ from Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|During the day, Pacific {{angelsharks}} {{are almost}} {{never seen in}} the open, instead resting motionless on the sea floor buried under <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> sediment that disguises their outlines. At night some individuals remain motionless, waiting for prey, while others may be encountered on the bottom unburied or actively swimming. Large sharks, including the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) and the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus), and the northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) are known to consume Pacific angelsharks. Known parasites of this species include the copepod Trebius latifurcatus, which infests the skin, the myxosporidian Chloromyxum levigatum, which infests the gall bladder, and the tapeworm Paraberrapex manifestus, which infests the spiral valve intestine. The leech Branchellion lobata may be attached around this shark's cloaca, inside the intestine, and even inside the uterus and on developing embryos.|$|E
5|$|Liquid crystal {{materials}} {{became a}} focus {{of research in the}} development of flat panel electronic displays beginning in 1962 at RCA Laboratories. When physical chemist Richard Williams applied an electric field to <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> a nematic liquid crystal at 125°C, he observed the formation of a regular pattern that he called domains (now known as Williams Domains). This led his colleague George H. Heilmeier to perform research on a liquid crystal-based flat panel display to replace the cathode ray vacuum tube used in televisions. But the para-Azoxyanisole that Williams and Heilmeier used exhibits the nematic liquid crystal state only above 116°C, which made it impractical to use in a commercial display product. A material that could be operated at room temperature was clearly needed.|$|E

5000|$|Closed-cell foams are {{superior}} insulators. While open-cell foams typically have R-values of 3 to 4 per inch (RSI-0.53 to RSI-0.70 per inch), closed-cell foams can attain R-values of 5 to 8 per inch (RSI-0.88 to RSI-1.41 per inch). This is important if space is limited, {{because it allows}} <b>a</b> <b>thinner</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> insulation to be used. For example, a 1-inch <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> closed-cell foam provides about the same insulation factor as 2 inches of open-cell foam.|$|R
5|$|Manufacturers and {{academics}} have conducted studies and experiments {{in an effort}} to improve the stretchiness, melting characteristics, browning, fat content and water retention of pizza cheese. Several patents exist for specialized varieties of pizza cheese and for its processing. A study by Rudan and Barbano found that the addition of <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> vegetable oil atop low- and reduced-fat pizza cheese increased meltability and reduced browning and dehydration when the product was cooked, but the texture remained overly chewy and tough. A study by Perry et al. found various methods to heighten the melt of low-fat pizza cheese by increasing its moisture, including the use of pre-acidification, fat-replacers, and exopolysaccharide starter cultures as well as higher pasteurization temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Odontocetes possess {{teeth with}} {{cementum}} cells overlying dentine cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on {{the portion of}} the tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. Porpoises, like other odontocetes, possess only one blowhole. Breathing involves expelling stale air from the blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs. All porpoises have a thick layer of blubber. This blubber can help with insulation from the harsh underwater climate, protection to some extent as predators {{would have a hard time}} getting through a thick layer of fat, and energy for leaner times. Calves are born with only <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> blubber, but some species compensate for this with a covering of fine, downy hair known as lanugo.|$|E
5|$|Spathularia flavida may be {{distinguished}} from the velvet-foot fairy fan (Spathulariopsis velutipes) by differences in the stem: S.velutipes is fuzzy and brown rather than smooth and yellowish. The fuzziness {{is a result of}} <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> intertwined hyphae that cover the stem, which project short hyphae outward from the surface. The closely related species S.neesi has an ochre color, spores that measure 60–80 by 1.5–2µm, and paraphyses that are branched on the upper parts. Neolecta irregularis is roughly similar in appearance to S.flavida, but lacks a sharply differentiated, spoon-shaped head, has a stem lighter in color than the head, and microscopically, has much smaller oval to elliptical spores that measure 5.5–8.5 by 3–4µm. Another yellowish earth-tongue fungus, Microglossum rufum, has a well-defined oval to spoon-shaped head, and sausage- to spindle-shaped spores that are 18–38 by 4–6µm.|$|E
