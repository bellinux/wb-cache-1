30|$|Use of <b>automatic</b> <b>weld</b> quality {{monitoring}} systems results in reduced production costs through the reduced manpower required for inspection. An automatic detection system for welding {{should be able}} to classify weld defects like porosity, metal spatter, irregular bead shape, excessive root reinforcement, incomplete penetrations and burn-through. Most commercial monitoring systems work in a similar way: voltage, current, and other process signals are measured and compared with preset nominal values. An alarm is triggered when any difference from the preset values exceeds a given threshold. The alarm thresholds are correlated with real weld defects or relate to specifications defined in the welding procedure specification (WPS) (Pires et al. 2006). Currently, common nondestructive testing methods for inspection of weld bead include radiography, ultrasonic, vision, magnetic detection, and eddy current and acoustic measurements (Abdullah et al. 2013).|$|R

Using titanium rather than steel would have been ideal, but it was expensive and difficult to work with. The problem of cracks in welded titanium structures with thin walls could not be solved, so the heavier nickel steel was used instead. It cost far less than titanium and allowed for welding, along with heat-resistant seals. [...] The MiG-25 was constructed from 80% nickel-steel alloy, 11% aluminium, and 9% titanium.

40|$|Among those <b>automatic</b> <b>weld</b> defects {{inspection}} techniques {{based on}} real-time dynamic X-ray imaging, background subtraction is often adopted. The {{key to this}} method is how to estimate the weld background and it is mainly realized by low-pass filter or curve fitting methods. Generally, there are many false alarms and inaccurate defect shape due to inaccuracy of weld background obtained by these methods. This paper proposes a method of background subtraction based on partial surface reconstruction. Firstly, the possible defect positions are identified by gray-level wave analysis, and then weld background is estimated by reconstruction of these areas. This segmentation method has been employed in real-time X-ray automatic inspection system, which is being used for steel pipe manufacture in the West-East natural gas transmission project.
