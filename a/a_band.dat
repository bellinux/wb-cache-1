5|$|Although he {{left his}} bass and {{amplifier}} at home in Oadby, after {{less than a year}} of studying in London, he decided he wanted to join <b>a</b> <b>band.</b> By 1970, Freddie Mercury, Brian May, and Roger Taylor had already formed Queen; Deacon saw them in October that year but was not immediately impressed. Later in the year, he briefly formed <b>a</b> <b>band</b> called Deacon that made one live appearance at Chelsea College.|$|E

5|$|I don't see {{the point}} of playing in <b>a</b> <b>band</b> and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be {{impossible}} for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in <b>a</b> <b>band</b> that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.|$|E

5|$|Tin Machine's {{first world}} tour was a {{commercial}} success, {{but there was}} growing reluctance—among fans and critics alike—to accept Bowie's presentation as merely <b>a</b> <b>band</b> member.

Performing his early hits during the seven-month Sound+Vision Tour, he found commercial success and acclaim once again.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} new {{representation}} for the inverse of a matrix {{that is a}} sum of <b>a</b> <b>banded</b> matrix and <b>a</b> semiseparable matrix.

Using this result, we devise a fast algorithm for the solution of linear systems of equations involving such matrices. Numerical {{results show that the}} new algorithm competes favorably with existing techniques in terms of computational time...|$|R
