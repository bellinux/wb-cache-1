5|$|Beebe had {{a troubled}} {{relationship}} {{with some of}} his superiors at the zoo, particularly Hornaday, who was resentful of Beebe's constant demands for more funding and staff, as well as the fact that as Beebe's career progressed he gradually devoted less <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> to caring for the zoo itself. One particular point of disagreement was Beebe's forgetfulness about returning books which he had borrowed from the Zoological Society's Library, which would occasionally go missing for years as a result. However, Hornaday never publicly expressed his disagreements with Beebe, and did not hesitate to defend Beebe's work when others criticized it.|$|E
5|$|The Congressional Research Service (CRS) {{estimated}} that shutting down VH-71 production, upgrading the existing fleet, and later implementing a successor program would cost $14–$21billion. It was reported {{not only that}} a new fleet would not be available until 2024 (at which point the existing helicopters would have remained in service while being over 50 years old), but that terminating the existing program would waste more than $3billion in sunk VH-71 costs. Following the President’s decision to terminate the program a variety of lawmakers, think tanks and media outlets publicly concluded {{it would be more}} cost effective <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> consuming to continue with a variation of the existing VH-71 program.|$|E
5|$|The redback {{is mainly}} nocturnal; the female remains {{concealed}} during the day, and spins her web during the night, usually {{remaining in the}} same location {{for most of her}} adult life. Classified as a gum-footed tangle web, the web is an irregular-looking tangle of fine but strong silk. Although the threads seem random, they are strategically placed for support and entrapment of prey. The rear portion of the web forms a funnel-like retreat area where the spider and egg sacs are found. This area has vertical, sticky catching threads that run to ground attachments. The vertical strands act as trip wires to initially alert the spider to the presence of prey or threats. They also snare and haul prey into the air when weaker horizontal strands that hold them down, known as guy lines, break when prey thrash around. These webs are usually placed between two flat surfaces, one beneath the other. The female spends more time in the funnel <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> moving around during cooler weather.|$|E

Consider a secretary's performance, which might be measured by number of breaks per hour and {{the time required to}} complete reports. The two measures are orthogonal because they do not overlap. However, it is possible that repeated evaluations could show a reliable association between a higher number of breaks per hour <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> required to complete reports.|$|E
25|$|Black bears do {{compete with}} cougars over carcasses. Like brown bears, they will {{sometimes}} steal kills from cougars. One {{study found that}} both bear species visited 24% of cougar kills in Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks, usurping 10% of carcasses. Another study found that black bears visited 48% of cougar kills in summer in Colorado, and 77% of kills in California.

25|$|As Armstrong {{spent less}} <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> at the Elswick works, he spent {{more and more}} time at Cragside, and it became his main home. In 1869 he {{commissioned}} the celebrated architect Richard Norman Shaw to enlarge and improve the house, and this was done over a period of 15years. In 1883 Armstrong gave Jesmond Dene, together with its banqueting hall to the city of Newcastle. He retained his house next to the Dene. Armstrong entertained several eminent guests at Cragside, including the Shah of Persia, the King of Siam, the prime minister of China and the Prince and Princess of Wales.|$|E
25|$|The Kintampo site is {{most often}} studied by archaeologists who are {{interested}} in seeing how people made the change between foraging and horticulture and agriculture as a way of producing food. Kintampo is seen as an example of neither foraging or farming, but somewhere in between. As practitioners of sedentism, derived from the word sedentary, the people of Kintampo spent more time in their villages <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> wandering around, hunting and gathering food. They took advantage of plants that were native to the area, and although technically they were not farming, they did influence the evolution of plants, effectively being some of the first to domesticate plants in Africa.|$|E
25|$|In {{families}} {{with more than}} one child (twins or triplets), it has been found that maternal sensitivity is lower, as there are more needs {{to be taken care of}} by the mother <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> to form a unique bond, which in turn results in decreased cognitive development in the infants (relative to if the child were raised alone). Furthermore, in the newborn period, women who displayed high maternal sensitivity had children who were able to regulate their emotions and who had higher symbolic and cognitive skills. In the case of the triplets, the child that received the least maternal sensitivity was the one that showed the poorest outcomes cognitively and had the most medical problems.|$|E

25|$|Blonger had a host {{of legal}} talent at his disposal, {{not to mention a}} {{sympathetic}} judge or two. His personal lawyer, Thomas Ward, Jr., was a former U.S. district attorney who had argued cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. While the rest of the gang was represented by lesser names, they all benefited from the roadblocks laid down by the lead lawyers in the conspiracy case. The defense successfully fought to have Van Cise removed from the prosecution of the case on a technicality, but Van Cise considered this a tactical error, since it allowed him to spend more time devising the prosecution's strategy <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> in court. The case proceeded with two special prosecutors, S. Harrison White, former chief justice of the Colorado Supreme Court, and Harry C. Riddle, a former district court judge.|$|E
25|$|Nellie Patterson {{spent less}} <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> in the Dupont Circle mansion over the years, preferring her long-time home in Chicago. She became morbidly obese, then {{suffered}} a heart attack and lost a significant amount of weight. In September 1922, Cissy Patterson (herself spending more time at her other homes and abroad) allowed her daughter, Felicia, and her new husband, Drew Pearson, to take up residence in the mansion. Nellie Patterson vacated 15 Dupont Circle for good in 1923, never to return, and deeded the property to Cissy that same year. Although Cissy formally took up residence there in 1923, she spent most of her time elsewhere. The house was barely occupied from 1923 to 1929, as the Pearsons left for Asia in 1925 and never returned to the home. Cissy Patterson's divorce from her first husband, Count Josef Gizycki, was finalized in 1917. She married New York City lawyer Elmer Schlesinger in 1925, but used the mansion little in the years afterward.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of the Menin Road Ridge on 20 September, was {{the first}} attack with the more limited {{territorial}} objectives developed since 31 July, {{to benefit from the}} artillery reinforcements brought into the Second Army area and a pause of three weeks for preparation, during which the clouds dispersed and the sun began to dry the ground. The shorter intervals between attacks since then had several effects, allowing less time for either side to prepare and the Germans had to take more risks {{on the rest of the}} Western Front, to replace tired and depleted divisions in Flanders. German troops and ammunition trains overloaded the rail network in west Flanders, while more German artillery escaped British counter-battery fire <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> was available for wire cutting and pillbox destruction, although the Germans generally left these to give battle in the open. The British artillery preparation before Polygon Wood on 26 September, began 24 hours before the infantry attack. No formal artillery preparation was conducted before 4 October, except for the normal heavy artillery counter-battery fire and destructive fire on German strong-points.|$|E
50|$|According to {{strategic}} pluralism theory, men {{may have}} correspondingly evolved to pursue reproductive {{strategies that are}} contingent on their own physical attractiveness. More physically attractive men accrue reproductive benefits from spending more time seeking multiple mating partners <b>and</b> relatively <b>less</b> <b>time</b> investing in offspring. In contrast, the reproductive effort of physically less attractive men, who therefore {{will not have the}} same mating opportunities, is better allocated either to investing heavily in accruing resources, or investing in their mates and offspring <b>and</b> spending relatively <b>less</b> <b>time</b> seeking additional mates.|$|R

500|$|Humans first {{inhabited}} the peninsula of Florida approximately 14,000 to 15,000 {{years ago when}} it looked vastly different. The west coast extended about [...] {{to the west of}} its current location. The landscape had large dunes and sweeping winds characteristic of an arid region, and pollen samples show foliage was limited to small stands of oak, and scrub bushes. As Earth's glacial ice retreated, winds slowed and vegetation became more prevalent and varied. The Paleo-Indian diets were dominated by small plants and the wild game available, which included saber-toothed cats, ground sloths, and spectacled bears. The Pleistocene megafauna died out around 11,000 years ago. Around 6,500 years ago, the climate of Florida changed again during the Holocene climatic optimum and became much wetter. Paleo-Indians spent more time in camps <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> traveling between sources of water.|$|E
500|$|In July 2005, Chris Wilson, the Internet Explorer Platform Architect, {{stated that}} passing Acid2 {{was not a}} {{priority}} for Internet Explorer 7, describing the test as a [...] "wish list" [...] of features rather than a true test of standards compliance. In December 2007, Microsoft announced that all the changes required to pass Acid2 would be made available in Internet Explorer 8, but that the changes would not be turned on by default, meaning that IE8 would not actually pass the test. The concern was that switching to a new behavior would cause too many problems in web pages expecting Internet Explorer's old, non-compliant behavior. Then in March 2008 Microsoft released IE8 beta 1 {{and turned on the}} changes by default after all. James Pratt, product manager for IE8, explained that this decision was made so that [...] "developers can spend more time building features and cool stuff, <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> just trying to tweak their sites across different browsers." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{expedition}} {{suffered a}} series of early misfortunes which hampered the first season's work and impaired preparations for the main polar march. On its journey from New Zealand to the Antarctic, Terra Nova nearly sank in a storm and was then trapped in pack ice for 20days, far longer than other ships had experienced, which meant a late-season arrival <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> for preparatory work before the Antarctic winter. At Cape Evans, Antarctica, one of the motor sledges was lost during its unloading from the ship, breaking through the sea ice and sinking. Deteriorating weather conditions and weak, unacclimatised ponies affected the initial depot-laying journey, so that the expedition's main supply point, One Ton Depot, was laid [...] north of its planned location at 80°S. Lawrence Oates, {{in charge of the}} ponies, advised Scott to kill ponies for food and advance the depot to 80°S, which Scott refused to do. Oates is reported as saying to Scott, [...] "Sir, I'm afraid you'll come to regret not taking my advice." [...] Four ponies died during this journey either from the cold or because they slowed the team down and were shot.|$|E
500|$|The tammar {{rests in}} two positions: a [...] "sitting tail forward" [...] position, {{in which the}} hind legs are outstretched with tail brought forward in between, the body prone and the head above ground; and a [...] "lying" [...] position, in which the animal lies on its side with the head {{touching}} the ground. The former position is typically used during the day for long periods, and the latter position is used at night for brief periods. Tammars are known to live in stable groups, which lessens the chance of an individual being taken by a predator. As the group increases in size, tammars spend more time foraging, grooming and interacting <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> being vigilant and moving around. Predators of the tammar include dingos, feral cats, red foxes and wedge-tailed eagles. They {{may also have been}} preyed upon by the extinct thylacine. Tammars appear to respond more to the sight than the sound of predators. They can also use their acute sense of smell to detect a predator. When a predator is detected, a tammar will alert others by thumping its foot. When lost, young tammars are known to emit a coarse screeching call and adult females may respond with a similar call.|$|E
