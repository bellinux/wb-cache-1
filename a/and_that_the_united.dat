However, other polls seemed to favor the Schindler family's position, and questions were raised about the wording of all the polls.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Nixon Doctrine {{that the}} U.S. would avoid direct combat {{assistance}} to allies where possible, instead giving them assistance to defend themselves, the U.S. greatly increased arms sales to the Middle East—particularly Israel, Iran and Saudi Arabia—during the Nixon administration. The Nixon administration strongly supported Israel, an American ally in the Middle East, but the support was not unconditional. Nixon believed that Israel should make peace with its Arab neighbors <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States should encourage it. The president believed that—except during the Suez Crisis—the U.S. had failed to intervene with Israel, and should use the leverage of the large U.S. military aid to Israel to urge {{the parties to the}} negotiating table. The Arab-Israeli conflict was not a major focus of Nixon's attention during his first term—for one thing, he felt that no matter what he did, American Jews would oppose his reelection.|$|E

5|$|South Pacific Air Lines (SPAL) {{had been}} granted {{permission}} by the United States and British governments to operate a flying boat service from Christmas Island. Patrick Dean asked the British Ambassador to the United States, Sir Roger Makins to sound out the U.S. government about terminating the contract. Makins reported in March 1956 that Admiral Arthur W. Radford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was willing to help {{so long as the}} dormant American claim to the island was not prejudiced. The lease on the island facilities, including the airfield and the port, {{had been granted}} to SPAL with a clause in the contract that said it could be terminated if there was a military necessity to do so. The Americans proposed that the British tell SPAL that they were establishing an airbase on the island, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States would support this so long as SPAL was paid fair compensation. An official letter was sent to the president of SPAL on 1 May 1956, withdrawing the permit to operate from Christmas Island, regretting any inconvenience, and offering to consider compensation.|$|E
5|$|At the election, Labour lost 91 {{seats in}} the House of Commons, but the Conservatives failed to achieve an overall majority, {{resulting}} in the first hung parliament since 1974. Under the constitution governing {{what happens in the}} event of a hung parliament, Brown remained temporarily as Prime Minister, while the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives entered into talks aimed at forming a coalition government. Talks between the Liberal Democrats and Labour also took place. On 10 May, Brown announced his intention to resign as leader of the Labour Party and instructed the party to initiate the election of a new leader. Brown's continued presence as Prime Minister was seen an obstacle to the negotiation of a Labour-Liberal Democrat deal. By 11 May, the possibility of a deal was becoming less likely as talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats continued. After a telephone conversation with his predecessor Tony Blair where Blair informed Brown that the election had shown that the British voters had lost faith in both him and the Labour Party <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom would not accept him continuing as Prime Minister. With this he concluded that he would not be able to form a government, Brown announced his resignation as Prime Minister. He also resigned as leader of the Labour Party with immediate effect. Brown was succeeded as Prime Minister by David Cameron, while Harriet Harman became acting leader of the Labour Party.|$|E

25|$|Cilicia Pedias ("flat Cilicia"—; Assyrian Kue), to the east, {{included}} the rugged spurs of Taurus {{and a large}} coastal plain, with rich loamy soil, known to the Greeks such as Xenophon, who passed through with his mercenary group of the Ten Thousand, for its abundance (euthemia), filled with sesame and millet and olives and pasturage for the horses imported by Solomon. Many of its high places were fortified. The plain is watered by the three great rivers, the Cydnus (Tarsus Çay), the Sarus (Seyhan) and the Pyramus (Ceyhan River), each of which brings down much silt from the deforested interior and which fed extensive wetlands. The Sarus now enters the sea almost due south of Tarsus, but there are clear indications that at one period it joined the Pyramus, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>united</b> rivers ran to the sea west of Kara-tash.

One of the cars belonged to Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh. Fay was sentenced by a District Court to two months' imprisonment and three strokes of the cane on each charge. The High Court later rejected an appeal against the sentence. The caning sentence provoked much controversy in the United States, and was condemned as cruel and excessive for a non-violent offence. On the other hand, {{a significant number of}} Americans supported the penalty, reasoning that American citizens who travelled abroad had to respect the laws of the countries that they visited, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States was not tough enough on its own juvenile offenders.

25|$|In 1903, American Senator Henry Cabot Lodge {{advocated}} {{that the}} United States should purchase the islands from France. Lodge {{was concerned about}} the French influence on Saint Pierre and Miquelon, possible political or cultural effects on Canada and the United States, and the effect of French fishing fleets on New England fisheries. The economy of the islands had been in decline due to poor cod fishing seasons, and many residents were angry at France for insisting on approving all teachers on the islands. For these reasons, many residents of the islands were in favor of becoming part of the United States, reasoning that they could then sell their fish {{to the rest of the}} United States without import taxes, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States would not interfere with their local educational system. In response, some Canadians asked Great Britain to purchase the islands from France instead. In an election for the islands' representative to the French Chamber of Deputies, one candidate was in favor of annexation while the incumbent candidate was not. The incumbent candidate, who was against annexation, won reelection by a small margin in December 1903. The islands were not purchased by either country, and they remained part of France.|$|E
