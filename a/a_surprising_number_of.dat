However, to compete with Alpine's success, other manufacturers developed increasingly special cars, notably the Lancia Stratos which was based closely on the A110's size and rear-engined concept, though incorporating a Ferrari engine. Alpine's own cars, still based on the 1962 design and using <b>a</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> production parts, became increasingly uncompetitive.

To pilots who had once flown the tricky Polikarpov I-16, the aerodynamic quirks of the mid-engined aircraft were unimportant. In the Far East, P-63 and P-39 aircraft {{were used in the}} Soviet invasion of Manchukuo and northern Korea. In the Pacific theatre, the Kingcobras flew escort, close air support and ground attack missions. The Soviet P-63s achieved their first air victory on 15 August 1945, when Lejtenant I. F.

30|$|Overall, <b>a</b> <b>surprising</b> high <b>number</b> <b>of</b> {{amino acid}} {{positions}} (41 – 59 %; Fig.  1) was identified {{to be beneficial}} for cosolvent resistance of BSLA (DMSO 59 %; DOx 41 %; TFE 41 %). The latter corresponds to 4.4 – 10.2 % of all 3620 BSLA variants in the SSM-BSLA library and convincingly explains why cosolvent improved variants can be found after screening {{of only a few}} thousand clones in a directed evolution campaign; the obtainable sequence space of BSLA is 20181. Significant differences were found among the tolerance towards the three selected cosolvents, for instance despite that more BSLA variants are found with improved DMSO cosolvent resistance, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> variants with improvements >  2.5 -fold was 5.7 -fold higher for TFE (0.17 %) than for DMSO and DOx (0.03 %). The higher improvement factors in TFE resistance indicate significant differences in interactions between BSLA and the cosolvents TFE and DMSO/DOx. The latter indicate an unequal potential in optimizing BSLA’s tolerance against TFE and DMSO/DOx. Furthermore, the percentage of highly beneficial substitutions (>  2.5 -fold improvement) is very low and one can expect that these substitutions would rarely be found in directed evolution campaigns.|$|R

[...] Adam Suraf of Dunkirkma.net named it the third best episode of the season. He also praised the episode's cultural references. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "There's a lovely nod to the earlier episodes in which Marge protests the citizenry's hare-brained ideas at council meetings. A series of bizarre moments rather than a story—we're especially fond of Homer's photographic memory and Mr Burns' descent into insanity—but great fun." [...] Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of A, and Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave it a score of 4 out of 5. The episode is Sarah Culp of The Quindecims eleventh-favorite episode of the show, and one of Les Winan of Box Office Prophets's favorite episodes. A scene from the episode where former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger meets Burns was included in the 2002 documentary film The Trials of Henry Kissinger.|$|E

40|$|Characteristic modes (CMs) provide deep {{insight into}} the {{electromagnetic}} behaviour of any arbitrarily shaped conducting structure because the CMs are unique to the geometry of the object. We exploit this very fact by predicting <b>a</b> perhaps <b>surprising</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> important antenna metrics such as resonance frequency, radiation efficiency and antenna Q (bandwidth) without needing to specify a feeding location. In doing so, {{it is possible to}} define a collection of objective functions {{that can be used in}} an optimizer to shape-synthesize antennas without needing to define a feed location a priori. We denote this novel form of optimization “feedless” or “excitation-free” antenna shape synthesis. Fundamentally, we are allowing the electromagnetics to dictate how the antenna synthesis should proceed and are in no way imposing the physical constraints enforced by fixed feeding structures. This optimization technique is broadly applied to three major areas of antenna research: electrically small antennas, multi-band antennas and reflectarrays. Thus, the scope of applicability ranges from small antennas, to intermediate sizes and concludes with electrically large antenna designs, which is a testament to the broad applicability of characteristic mode theory. Another advantage of feedless electromagnetic shape synthesis is the ability to synthesize antennas whose desirable properties approach the fundamental limits imposed by electromagnetics. As an additional benefit, the feedless optimization technique is shown to have greater computational efficiency than traditional antenna optimization techniques...|$|R

The numerical resolution of the simulations allows us to track in detail {{the orbits of}} the ∼ ten brightest satellites around each primary. Most satellites follow conventional orbits; after turning around, they accrete into their host halo and settle on orbits whose apocentric radii are steadily eroded by dynamical friction.
