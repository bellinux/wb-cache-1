500|$|In her {{civilian}} identity, Barbara Gordon, Ph.D., {{is depicted}} as a career woman with a doctorate in library science, {{as well as being}} head of Gotham City public library, [...] "presumably one of the largest public libraries in the DC Comics version of reality." [...] She was given a regular backup slot in Detective Comics starting with issue #384 (February 1969), alternating issues with Robin until issue #404, after which she had the backup slot to herself. Frank Robbins wrote nearly all of these backups, which were penciled first by Gil Kane and later by Don Heck. Barbara Gordon’s Batgirl exceeded the earlier Bat-Girl and Batwoman characters in popularity, and readers requested for her to appear in other titles. Although some readers requested that Batwoman also continue to appear in publication, DC responded to the fan-based acclaim and criticism of the new character in an open letter in Detective Comics #417 (1971), stating: [...] "I'd like to say <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>words</b> <b>about</b> the reaction some readers have to Batgirl. These are readers who remember Batwoman and the other Bat-girls from years back... They were there because romance seemed to be needed in Batman's life. But thanks to the big change and a foresighted editor, these hapless females are gone for good. In their place stands a girl who is a capable crime-fighter, a far cry from Batwoman who constantly had to be rescued [...] Batman." ...|$|E

500|$|Many manga {{artists have}} cited Dragon Ball and Toriyama as inspirations, {{including}} Fairy Tail and Rave author Hiro Mashima. Both One Piece creator Eiichiro Oda and Naruto creator Masashi Kishimoto {{have said that}} Goku inspired their series' main protagonists {{as well as their}} structures. For the kanzenban re-release of Dragon Ball, every odd-numbered volume included a tribute illustration by a popular manga artist who was a child when it was serialized, accompanied with <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>words</b> <b>about</b> how the series influenced them. The artists who contributed include: Bleach creator Tite Kubo, Black Cat author Kentaro Yabuki, The Seven Deadly Sins author Nakaba Suzuki, Eyeshield 21 and One-Punch Man illustrator Yusuke Murata, Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo creator Yoshio Sawai, Pretty Face author Yasuhiro Kanō, Mr. Fullswing author Shinya Suzuki, Hellsing creator Kouta Hirano, Claymore author Norihiro Yagi, Phantom Thief Jeanne and Full Moon o Sagashite creator Arina Tanemura, Excel Saga author Rikdo Koshi, Dragon Drive creator Kenichi Sakura, and Happy World! author Kenjiro Takeshita. The producer of the Tekken video game series, Katsuhiro Harada, said that Dragon Ball {{was one of the first}} works to visually depict chi and thereby influenced Tekken and other Japanese games such as Street Fighter. Ian Jones-Quartey, a producer of the American animated series Steven Universe, is a fan of Dragon Ball and Dr. Slump, and uses Toriyama's vehicle designs as a reference for his own. He also stated that [...] "We're all big Toriyama fans on , which kind of shows a bit." ...|$|E
