25|$|Induction heating is a {{non-contact}} {{process which}} uses {{the principle of}} electromagnetic induction to produce heat in a workpiece. By placing a conductive material into a strong alternating magnetic field, electric current is made to flow in the material, thereby causing Joule heating. In magnetic materials, further heat is generated below the Curie point due to hysteresis losses. The generated current is predominantly in the surface layer, the depth of this layer being dictated by {{the frequency of the}} <b>alternating</b> <b>field</b> and the permeability of the material.|$|E
25|$|The {{transverse}} de-focusing {{effect of}} this radial field gradient is compensated by ridges on the magnet faces which vary the field azimuthally as well. This allows particles to be accelerated continuously, on every period of the radio frequency (RF), rather than in bursts as in most other accelerator types. This principle that <b>alternating</b> <b>field</b> gradients have a net focusing effect is called strong focusing. It was obscurely known theoretically long before it was put into practice. Examples of isochronous cyclotrons abound; in fact almost all modern cyclotrons use azimuthally-varying fields. The TRIUMF cyclotron mentioned below is the largest with an outer orbit radius of 7.9metres, extracting protons at up to 510MeV, which is 3/4 {{of the speed of}} light. The PSI cyclotron reaches higher energy but is smaller because of using a higher magnetic field.|$|E

2500|$|Livingston {{was unable}} to stay at Brookhaven to see the Cosmotron project {{completed}} because he faced losing his tenure at MIT, and elected to return there in 1948. At MIT he taught classes, and participated in a 1950 experiment by the Los Alamos National Laboratory to investigate the lifetimes of short-lived fission products. He still thought about accelerators, though, and in 1952, along with Ernest Courant, Hartland Snyder and J. Blewett at Brookhaven, developed strong focusing, [...] the principle that the net effect on a particle beam of charged particles passing through <b>alternating</b> <b>field</b> gradients {{is to make the}} beam converge. [...] The advantages of strong focusing were then quickly realised, and deployed on the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron, which achieved 33 GeV in 1960. A plan to build a synchrotron at MIT and Harvard also came to fruition under Livingston's leadership, resulting in the Cambridge Electron Accelerator (CEA), which became operational in 1962. The CEA exploded on July 6, 1965, injuring eight people, one of them fatally.|$|E

50|$|Another kind of {{laboratory}} remanence is anhysteretic remanence or anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM). This is induced by exposing a magnet {{to a large}} <b>alternating</b> <b>field</b> plus a small dc bias field. The amplitude of the <b>alternating</b> <b>field</b> is gradually reduced to zero to get an anhysteretic magnetization, and then the bias field is removed to get the remanence. The anhysteretic magnetization curve is often close {{to an average of}} the two branches of the hysteresis loop, and is assumed in some models to represent the lowest-energy state for a given field. ARM has also been studied because of its similarity to the write process in some magnetic recording technology and to the acquisition of natural remanent magnetization in rocks.|$|E

30|$|One of the {{promising}} directions for medical application of magnetic nanoparticles is hyperthermia—locally heating the oncological tumors under {{the action of}} an <b>alternating</b> magnetic <b>field</b> to 43 – 45  °C, at which the tumor cells die [8]. Application of an external <b>alternating</b> magnetic <b>field</b> {{is accompanied by a}} number of problems: uneven and uncontrolled heating tumor, risk of overheating and destruction of healthy tissues, and impossibility of heating the deep-seated tumors. Therefore, in 1993, Prof. Jordan suggested the idea of magnetic hyperthermia, which consisted {{in the use of the}} magnetic nanoparticles and an <b>alternating</b> magnetic <b>field</b> [9]. In this case, the magnetic nanoparticles must be previously injected into the tumor, and such tumor must be affected by an <b>alternating</b> magnetic <b>field.</b> Particle temperature will increase by the absorption of magnetic energy and provide the local heating. However, such nanoparticles must satisfy a number of requirements: small sizes and weak agglomeration of nanoparticles; such particles must be single domain and superparamagnetic (to prevent interactions between individual nanoparticles in the absence of magnetic field), and they must effectively heat up in the <b>alternating</b> magnetic <b>field</b> to the required temperatures (43 – 45  °C) and demonstrate high specific loss power (SLP) values.|$|R
40|$|Magnetic fields {{emanate from}} radial tires {{due to the}} {{presence}} of reinforcing belts which are made of magnetized steel wire. When these tires spin, they generate <b>alternating</b> magnetic <b>fields</b> of extremely low frequency (ELF), usually below 20 Hz. The fundamental frequency of these fields is determined by tire rotation rate and has a sinusoidal waveform with a high harmonic content. The static field of radial tires can exceed 500 mT at the tread, and the tire-generated <b>alternating</b> <b>fields</b> can exceed 2. 0 mT at seat level in the passenger compartment of vehicles. Degaussing the tires reduces both the static and <b>alternating</b> <b>fields</b> to low levels, but the fields increase gradually over time after degaussing.

40|$|Abstract. By {{means of}} two- and {{three-dimensional}} particle-in-cell simulations, we investigate {{the process of}} driven magnetic reconnection at the termination shock of relativistic striped flows. In pulsar winds and in magnetar-powered relativistic jets, the flow consists of stripes of <b>alternating</b> magnetic <b>field</b> polarity, separated by current sheets of hot plasma. At the wind termination shock, the flow compresses and the <b>alternating</b> <b>fields</b> annihilate by driven magnetic reconnection. Irrespective of the stripe wavelength λ or the wind magnetization σ (in the regime σ 1 of magnetically-dominated flows), shock-driven reconnection transfers all the magnetic energy of <b>alternating</b> <b>fields</b> to the particles, whose average Lorentz factor increases {{by a factor of}} σ with respect to the pre-shock value. In the limit λ/(rLσ) 1, where rL is the relativistic Larmor radius in the wind, the post-shock particle spectrum approaches a flat power-law tail with slope around − 1. 5, populated by particles accelerated by the reconnection electric field. The presence of a current-aligned “guide ” magnetic field suppresses the acceleration of particles only when the guide field is stronger than the alternating component. Our findings place important constraints on the models of non-thermal radiation from Pulsar Wind Nebulae and relativistic jets...|$|R
