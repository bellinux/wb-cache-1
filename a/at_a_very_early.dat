5|$|On {{the issue}} of {{geographic}} origin, linguists during the 20th century agreed that the Uto-Aztecan language family originated in the southwestern United States. Evidence from archaeology and ethnohistory supports a southward diffusion across the American continent thesis, specifically that speakers of early Nahuan languages migrated from Aridoamerica into central Mexico in several waves. But recently, the traditional assessment has been challenged by Jane H. Hill, who proposes instead that the Uto-Aztecan language family originated in central Mexico and spread northwards <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>early</b> date. This hypothesis and the analyses of data that it rests upon have received serious criticism.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory of}} {{their use in}} sexual display was first {{proposed}} by Davitashvili in 1961 and has gained increasing acceptance since. Evidence that visual display was important, either in courtship or in other social behavior, {{can be seen in}} the fact that horned dinosaurs differ markedly in their adornments, making each species highly distinctive. Also, modern living creatures with such displays of horns and adornments use them in similar behavior. A 2006 study of the smallest Triceratops skull, ascertained to be a juvenile, shows the frill and horns developed <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>early</b> age, predating sexual development and thus probably important for visual communication and species recognition in general. The use of the exaggerated structures in dinosaurs as species identification has been questioned, as no such function exists for structures in modern species.|$|E
60|$|Thus, as {{it seems}} to me, the leading facts in embryology, which are second to none in importance, are {{explained}} on the principle of variations in the many descendants from some one ancient progenitor, having appeared <b>at</b> <b>a</b> not <b>very</b> <b>early</b> period of life, and having been inherited <b>at</b> <b>a</b> corresponding period.

5|$|The most {{pressing}} threat for many species, particularly the smaller ones, comes from species introduced to their colonies. Procellariids overwhelmingly breed on islands away from land predators such as mammals, {{and for the}} most part have lost the defensive adaptations needed to deal with them (with the exception of the oil-spitting fulmarine petrels). The introduction of mammal predators such as feral cats, rats, mongooses and even mice can have disastrous results for ecologically naïve seabirds. These predators can either directly attack and kill breeding adults, or, more commonly, attack eggs and chicks. Burrowing species that leave their young unattended <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>early</b> stage are particularly vulnerable to attack. Studies on grey-faced petrels breeding on New Zealand's Whale Island (Moutohora) have shown that a population under heavy pressure from Norway rats will produce virtually no young during a breeding season, whereas if the rats are controlled (through the use of poison), breeding success is much higher. That study also highlighted the role that non-predatory introduced species can play in harming seabirds; introduced rabbits on the island caused little damage to the petrels, other than damaging their burrows, but they also acted as a food source for the rats during the non-breeding season, which allowed rat numbers to be higher than they otherwise would be, resulting in more predators for the petrels to contend with. Interactions with introduced species can be quite complex. Gould's petrels breed only on two islands, Cabbage Tree Island and Boondelbah Island off Port Stephens (New South Wales). Introduced rabbits destroyed the forest understory on Cabbage Tree Island; this both increased the vulnerability of the petrels to natural predators and left them vulnerable to the sticky fruits of the birdlime tree (Pisonia umbellifera), a native plant. In the natural state these fruits lodge in the understory of the forest, but with the understory removed the fruits fall to the ground where the petrels move about, sticking to their feathers and making flight impossible.|$|E

40|$|Skeletal {{development}} of two marsupial species, the bandicoot, Isoodon macrourus and the brushtail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula, has been examined in whole mount preparations using a technique of clearing and differential staining of cartilage and bone. Both marsupials possess a complete cartilaginous skeleton at birth and ossification {{begins in the}} maxilla, mandible and certain bones of the forelimb soon after birth. The general pattern of ossification in these marsupials {{is similar to that}} in eutherians but the long bones of the forelimbs, and the thoracic vertebrae, have a precocious development when compared with that of eutherian mammals. This difference {{may be due to the}} requirement of the marsupial forearms for the passage of the young from the cloaca to the pouch. Accelerated rib development occurs, and is possibly related to respiratory movements which are initiated <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> much <b>earlier</b> stage than in eutherian mammals...|$|R

There was a substantial difference between the light curves for 11 month old gmelina trees in the three experiment plots with a 3 m x 3 m spacing compared with gmelina trees in the one experimental plot with a 4 m x 4 m spacing (Figure 6).

60|$|These two principles, namely, that slight {{variations}} generally appear <b>at</b> <b>a</b> not <b>very</b> <b>early</b> {{period of}} life, and are inherited <b>at</b> <b>a</b> corresponding not early period, explain, as I believe, all the above specified leading facts in embryology.

Some authors who have written on Dogs maintain that the greyhound and bull-dog, though so different, are really closely allied varieties, descended from the same wild stock, hence I was curious {{to see how far}} their puppies differed from each other. I was told by breeders that they differed just as much as their parents, and this, judging by the eye, seemed almost to be the case; but on actually measuring the old dogs and their six-days-old puppies, I found that the puppies had not acquired nearly their full amount of proportional difference. So, again, I was told that the foals of cart and race-horses--breeds which have been almost wholly formed by selection under domestication--differed as much as the full-grown animals; but having had careful measurements made of the dams and of three-days-old colts of race and heavy cart-horses, I find that this {{is by no means the}} case.|$|R

60|$|In those ancient days as now, {{there was}} an {{appropriate}} dress for youth, which was changed for that of a man when the subject arrived at maturity. The garment which was most distinctively characteristic of adult age among the Romans was called the toga; and it was assumed by the Roman youth, not as the dress of a man is by young persons now, in a private and informal manner, according as the convenience or fancy of the individual may dictate,--but publicly and with much ceremony, and always {{at the time when}} the party arrived at the period of legal majority; so that assuming the toga marked always <b>a</b> <b>very</b> important era of life. This distinction Agrippina caused to be conferred upon Nero by a special edict when he was only fourteen years of age, which was <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> much <b>earlier</b> period than usual. On the occasion of thus advancing him to the dress and to the legal capabilities of manhood, Agrippina brought him out in a special manner before the people of Rome <b>at</b> <b>a</b> great public celebration, and the more effectually to call public attention to him as a young prince of the highest distinction in the imperial family, she induced Claudius to bestow a largess upon the people, and a donative upon the army, that is a public distribution of money, to the citizens and to the soldiers, in Nero's name.|$|R
50|$|A Pele or tower house existed <b>at</b> Mordington from <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>early</b> date, {{probably}} {{from the time}} of the ownership of Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray, in the time of Robert the Bruce.

On 22 July 1650 Oliver Cromwell's forces marched from Berwick-upon-Tweed to the Mordington Tower house and camped there for two days. It appears the Hays may have been responsible for the construction of the magnificent Mordington House, a Georgian mansion centred upon the original Peel tower sections of which were incorporated in its walls. This was the centre block, two storey with basement and vaults, a seven bay front, flanking wings, originally two-storey Palladian pavilions, with single storey links to the main house. In 1932 the artist Frank W Wood painted the house and grounds (see above). Tragically, with great controversy, the house was demolished in 1973. A few years later a new smaller house was built on the site. The original house's lodge survives.|$|R
