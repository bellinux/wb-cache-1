500|$|Enterprise {{launched}} {{aircraft to}} patrol Ford Island {{and search for}} Japanese carriers. Five American pilots returning from missions to hunt down the Japanese fleet were mistakenly shot down by Ford Island anti-aircraft gunners while attempting to land. The island's commanding officer said about the friendly-fire losses, [...] "Somebody let fly <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> so many bullets {{in the air in}} my life and never expect to... all tracer bullets at night." ...|$|E
500|$|By autumn 1974, Drake's weekly {{retainer}} from Island had ceased, and {{his illness}} meant {{he remained in}} contact {{with only a few}} close friends. He had tried {{to stay in touch with}} Sophia Ryde, whom he had first met in London in 1968. Ryde has been described by Drake's biographers as [...] "the nearest thing" [...] to a girlfriend in his life, but she now prefers the description [...] "best (girl) friend". In a 2005 interview, Ryde revealed that a week before he died, she had sought to end the relationship: [...] "I couldn't cope with it. I asked him for some time. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> him again." [...] As with the relationship he had earlier shared with fellow folk musician Linda Thompson, Drake's relationship with Ryde was never consummated.|$|E

I hope we part as friends, on two sides of the war barrier that {{separates}} us. Please remember that there is nothing personal about this," [...] he repeated. [...] "I respect your stand and wish you well. My duty lies elsewhere." [...] We shook hands <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> him again.|$|E

6000|$|... "Pshaw! a noble effort, indeed! Why, {{the man has}} foiled me in the {{two things}} in which I prided myself most--wrestling <b>and</b> running. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> such a {{greyhound}} in my life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Eccellenza, {{he was my}} father's father; <b>and,</b> though <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> him, <b>I</b> {{know that}} the same blood runs in our veins. When this is so, there {{should be the same}} {{feelings}} in our hearts." ...|$|R
2500|$|After a {{successful}} {{action by the}} Conservative Party (UK) government the high court announced in July 2017 that the judicial review would be held in private and that evidence relating to the defence {{by the government and}} security services would neither be made available to Belhaj or his legal team nor made public. Criticising the decision Belhaj was quoted as saying that [...] "I went through a secret trial once before, in Gaddafi’s Libya. It took about a half hour, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> any of the evidence against me. Later a guard came to my cell and tossed in a red jumpsuit – that was how I found out that the secret court had sentenced me to die" [...] and continued [...] "what kind of a trial will it be if we put in a mountain of evidence and government officials can simply refuse to answer us". In response, Straw stated that he was opposed to extraordinary rendition and had not been complicit in it.|$|E
2500|$|From his {{earliest}} years Lucas {{had been a}} martyr to hereditary gout, which rendered him a complete cripple, and latterly obliged him to be carried to the House of Commons. Nevertheless, says an eye-witness, [...] "the gravity and uncommon neatness of his dress, his grey, venerable locks, blending with a pale but interesting countenance, in which an air of beauty was still visible, altogether excited attention, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> a stranger come into the house without asking who he was." [...] He died at his residence in Henry Street, Dublin, on Monday 4 November 1771. His remains were honoured with a public funeral of imposing solemnity. He was interred in the family burial-ground in St. Michan's churchyard. Lucas’s son Henry and other relatives were in attendance at his funeral, as were his friends Lord Charlemont, Flood and Adderley. The mourners also included officers and many hundred brethren of the guilds and the Lord Mayor {{with representatives of the}} Corporation and the Vice-Provost and scholars of Trinity College.|$|E
60|$|TANNER. [Smiting his brow] How frightfully, horribly true! It {{has been}} staring {{me in the}} face all my life; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> it before.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, he was sideways, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> really <b>saw</b> his face. He had {{a little}} cap. That's the only fairy I ever saw. Of course, there was Father Christmas, if you call him a fairy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Na, na," [...] said Ochiltree, [...] "I'll no hae {{that set}} down as ony part o' my answer--but I just meant to say, that in a' my memory <b>and</b> practice, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> ony gude come o' {{answering}} idle questions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you be so}} {{sure about}} that!" [...] cried a third. [...] "I've seen Jack Harrison fight five times, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> yet <b>saw</b> him have the worse of it. He's a slaughterer, <b>and</b> so <b>I</b> tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never thought}} you would mind that," [...] said Kate, rather abashed. [...] "I never did; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> my papa or mamma either." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I--I can't help it," [...] she sobbed. [...] "I'll be {{all right}} in a minute.... Our little girl, Billy. Think of it! <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> her!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{waiting for}} that eclipse," [...] I answered; [...] "I have had my eye on the moon for the last half-hour, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> it look healthier." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Mr. Bridger,' said he, 'I'm a Kentuckian, and I've seen a {{great deal}} of both men <b>and</b> animals. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> yet <b>saw</b> a man that was overfond of horses and dogs but what was cruel to women.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear father, reassure yourself. I love {{my cousin}} tenderly <b>and</b> sincerely. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> {{any woman who}} excited, as Elizabeth does, my warmest admiration and affection. My future hopes and {{prospects}} are entirely bound up in the expectation of our union." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. I was {{at school}} at Marysville until {{he took me}} away. I saw little of him {{for the past two}} years, for he had {{business}} in the mountains--very rough business, where he couldn't take me, for it kept him away from the settlements for weeks. I think {{it had something to do}} with cattle, for he was always having a new horse. I was all alone before that, too; I had no other relations; I had no friends. We had always been moving about so much, my brother <b>and</b> <b>I.</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> any one that I liked, except you, <b>and</b> until yesterday <b>I</b> had only HEARD you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is {{just what}} a young man ought to be," [...] said she, [...] "sensible, good-humoured, lively; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> such happy manners!--so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, George! is that you? I am {{delighted to}} see you. Going up to the terrace, I suppose? I was with Caroline {{for a few minutes}} last night, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> her looking better--never." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He won't--that's the worst," [...] Grace amended. [...] "It isn't as if he'd {{do things}} people would like, I've been to his place, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> such a horrid lot of things--not at all clever or pretty." ...|$|E
6000|$|It is the vulgar uneducated fellow that beats me. The Melanesians, {{laugh as}} you may at it, are {{naturally}} gentlemanly and courteous <b>and</b> well-bred. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> a [...] "gent" [...] in Melanesia, though not a few downright savages. I vastly prefer the savage.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{gets worse}} <b>and</b> worse; <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> such {{provoking}} old hens," [...] growled Tommy, {{thinking of the}} days when he often had six to rejoice over. [...] "Well, put 'em in my hat and give me a new bit of chalk; I must mark 'em up, any way." ...|$|R
60|$|Vivat Rex Eduardus! They crowned a king this day, {{and there}} has been great rejoicing and {{elaborate}} tomfoolery, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am perplexed <b>and</b> saddened. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> anything to compare with the pageant, except Yankee circuses and Alhambra ballets; nor did I ever see anything so hopeless and so tragic.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing like a {{touch of}} melodrama for the emotions," [...] he grumbled. [...] "Look at Lady Maggie! Her head might be {{touching}} the clouds, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> her eyes shine like that when she danced with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Kitty; and I {{live at the}} poor-house; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> a Cattle Show before, 'cause I didn't {{have any}} thing to bring," [...] said the child, feeling as {{important}} with her cat as a whole agricultural society.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' {{returned}} his wife, {{with an effort}} of generosity; 'and I believe you are right, Jasper, though I am sorry for my little solitary girl, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> a friend so perfectly suitable for her as your Mysie.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Besides," [...] said Dolores, [...] "Sister Angela {{will never}} let her go. <b>And</b> {{certainly}} <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> any one more TAKING than Sister Angela. She is {{so full of}} life, and of a certain unexpectedness, and one knows she has done such noble work. I {{want to see more}} of her." ...|$|R
60|$|That evening, at {{the crowded}} corner by the Cafe de la Paix, I caught a {{fleeting}} glimpse of Laploshka. He smiled, slightly raised his hat, <b>and</b> vanished. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> him again. After all, the money {{had been given}} to the deserving rich, and the soul of Laploshka was at peace.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} 'Bellforded' so often," [...] I said, [...] "that {{it has lost}} its edge. Still, in the end, it may grow wearisome. Would you be willing at all to {{entertain}} the hypothesis that my name is Edward Pinkhammer, <b>and</b> that <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> you before in my life?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For Cosimo?" [...] she cried, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> her {{so serious}} and thoughtful. [...] "For Cosimo? You are sure of this?" [...] The urgency of {{her tone was}} such that it held me there and {{compelled}} my answer.|$|E
60|$|The eye of our hostess {{was still}} bright {{and full of}} animation, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> a keener look than she {{fastened}} on the mate, as he delivered himself in this, one of his usual fits of misanthropical feeling.|$|E
60|$|Out into God's sweet air we went, But not in wonted way, For this man's {{face was}} white with fear, And that man's face was grey, <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> sad men who looked So wistfully at the day.|$|E
6000|$|... "That’s what I thought," [...] {{said his}} niece, [...] "but it wasn’t, because I got her off at last and searched it through <b>and</b> through. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> {{anything}} like her clothes {{in all my}} life. There was hardly a button or a tape on; and as for her stockings—" ...|$|R
5000|$|A woman slave, {{according}} to Daniel Meaders, [...] "married slave ..., {{but soon after}} the marriage, the 'husband was sold <b>and</b> sent away. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> him afterwards..|$|R
60|$|We {{went to see}} the Catholic church afterwards. There was {{a monstrous}} old gallery all {{on one side of the}} church, and none on the other.
