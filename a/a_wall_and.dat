5|$|Coursed mud {{construction}} {{is one of}} the oldest approaches to building walls. Moist mud is formed by hand to make the base of <b>a</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>and</b> allowed to dry. More mud is added and allowed to dry to form successive courses until the wall is complete. With puddled mud, a hand-made mud form is filled with wetter mud and allowed to dry.|$|E

5|$|During {{the course}} of the trilogy, Sparrow {{undergoes}} physical transformations. In The Curse of the Black Pearl, Sparrow curses himself to battle the undead Barbossa. Like all the actors playing the Black Pearl crew, Depp had to shoot scenes in costume as a reference for the animators, and his shots as a skeleton were shot again without him. Depp reprised the scene again on a motion capture stage. In At World's End, Sparrow hallucinates a version of himself as a member of Davy Jones's crew, adhered to <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> encrusted with barnacles. Verbinski oversaw that the design retained Sparrow's distinctive look, and rejected initial designs which portrayed him as over 100 years old.|$|E

5|$|The {{designers}} {{thought that}} Link's appearance should change when Link entered <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> the perspective switched from a top-down view to side view. They chose to make Link a mural {{while he was}} on a wall; this {{led to the creation of}} Yuga, the game's antagonist, a sorcerer that can transform himself and others into paintings. Aonuma mentioned that the idea of Link turning into a mural was inspired by Phantom Ganon jumping into paintings during his encounter in Ocarina of Time. As the game's story takes place long after the events of a A Link to the Past and the player travels between the two worlds of Hyrule and Lorule, the development team chose A Link Between Worlds instead of A Link to the Past 2 for the game's English-language title.|$|E

The second reported incident occurred in the United States on October 1, 2013, when a Tesla Model S caught fire after the electric car hit metal debris on a highway in Kent, Washington state, and the debris punctured one of 16 modules within the battery pack. A second reported fire occurred on October 18, 2013 in Merida, Mexico. In this case the vehicle was being driven at high speed through a roundabout and crashed through <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> into a tree.

5|$|The third {{practice}} session on Saturday saw limited running as well, as training was halted {{due to a}} massive crash by Carlos Sainz Jr.. The Spaniard lost control of his car going into turn 13, hit <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> went on to crash into the safety barriers, burying the nose of his car in the process. The session was stopped while Sainz {{was taken out of}} the car and transported to hospital, albeit uninjured. Practice was not resumed afterwards and the time of 1:38.561 set by Nico Rosberg before the accident remained the fastest lap of the session. He was more than seven-tenths of a second faster than Valtteri Bottas in second, with Lewis Hamilton another tenth behind. Sainz's teammate Max Verstappen finished the session 17th fastest after spinning in the final corner.|$|E

After the cotton exchange closed {{for the duration of the}} war, Jim worked as an inspector at Napier's engineering works, which made shell cases that were later filled with explosives. He volunteered to be a fireman at night and often watched Liverpool burning from his rooftop observer's position. Between 1940 and 1942, Liverpool endured 68 air-raids, which killed or injured more than 4,500 of the population and destroyed more than 10,000 homes. After the war he worked as an inspector for Liverpool Corporation's Cleansing Department before returning to the cotton trade in 1946.|$|E
5|$|Written by Joseph Lidster. A story idea {{considered}} for {{the third and fourth}} episodes of the fourth series. It was based upon the notion of 'faces' which people {{used to be able to}} see in patterned wallpaper. While redecorating, one of the Bannerman Road gang was to strip some paint off <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> reveal old wallpaper underneath. Faces would appear on the wallpaper; these would be aliens from another dimension trying to arrive on Earth, literally taking shape in walls and stepping through. It was noted that this notion could be adapted for patterns in wooden floors and doors.|$|E
5|$|After Cage {{finished}} {{teaching at}} the New School {{in the summer of}} 1960, Ono was determined to rent a place to present her works along with the work of other avant-garde artists in the city. She eventually found a cheap loft in downtown Manhattan at 112 Chambers Street that she used as a studio and living space. Supporting herself through secretarial work and lessons in the traditional Japanese arts at the Japan Society, Ono allowed composer La Monte Young to organize concerts in the loft. Both began organizing a series of events there from December 1960 through June 1961, with people such as Marcel Duchamp and Peggy Guggenheim attending, and both Ono and Young claimed to have been the primary curator of these events, with Ono claiming to have been eventually pushed into a subsidiary role by Young. The Chambers Street series hosted some of Ono's earliest conceptual artwork, including Painting to Be Stepped On, which was a scrap of canvas on the floor that became a completed artwork upon the accrual of footprints. With that work, Ono suggested that a work of art no longer needed to be mounted on <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> inaccessible. She showed this work and other instructional work again at Macunias's AG Gallery in July 1961.|$|E

5|$|As {{with many}} {{previous}} The Legend of Zelda games, solving puzzles and clearing dungeons remains a fundamental {{part of the}} gameplay. Progression through A Link Between Worlds is more open-ended than previous titles, {{with the possibility of}} tackling many of the game's dungeons in any order. Certain dungeon obstacles will require the use of the rented or purchased items. Towards the end of each dungeon, Link will encounter a boss that must be defeated. A unique mechanic that the game introduces is Link's ability to merge onto walls and move horizontally along them. Link is presented as a mural when he is merged on <b>a</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>and</b> upon merging, the game's perspective shifts to a side view to follow Link around corners. While merged to a wall, Link's energy gauge will deplete. The mechanic can be used for traversing the environment, reaching seemingly inaccessible areas, and avoiding hazards. It {{plays a key role in}} solving many of the game's puzzles and dungeons. Wall merging is also used as a means for travelling between Hyrule and Lorule, via fissures that connect the two kingdoms.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí {{carried out}} a second {{commission}} from Eusebi Güell between 1884 and 1887, the Güell Pavilions in Pedralbes, now {{on the outskirts of}} Barcelona. Güell had a country residence in Les Corts de Sarrià, consisting of two adjacent properties known as Can Feliu and Can Cuyàs de la Riera. The architect Joan Martorell had built a Caribbean-style mansion, which was demolished in 1919 {{to make way for the}} Royal Palace of Pedralbes. Gaudí undertook to refurbish the house and construct <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> porter's lodge. He completed the stone wall with several entrances, the main entrance with an iron gate in the shape of a dragon, with symbology allusive to the myths of Hercules and the Garden of the Hesperides. The buildings consist of a stable, covered longeing ring and porter's lodge: the stable has a rectangular base and catenary arches; the longeing ring has a square base with a hyperboloid dome; the porter's lodge consists of three small buildings, the central one being polygonal with a hyperbolic dome, and the other two smaller and cubic. All three are topped by ventilators in the shape of chimneys faced with ceramics. The walls are of exposed brick in various shades of reds and yellows; in certain sections prefabricated cement blocks are also used. The Pavilions are now the headquarters of the Real Cátedra Gaudí, of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia.|$|E
5|$|Khan {{is placed}} under guard in quarters. McGivers {{is sent to}} brief him on current events. Taking {{advantage}} of McGivers' attraction towards him, Khan tells her he means to rule mankind again and needs her help to take over Enterprise. Reluctantly, she agrees, beaming Khan to Botany Bay, where he revives {{the rest of his}} people. They return to Enterprise and assume control of the ship. Khan throws Kirk into a decompression tank, and threatens to slowly suffocate him unless Kirk's command crew agree to follow Khan. Having a change of heart, McGivers frees Kirk from the chamber. Kirk and Spock vent anesthetic gas throughout the entire ship to disable Khan and his cohorts. Khan escapes the gas and heads to Engineering, where he attempts to destroy Enterprise, but Kirk confronts him and a brawl ensues. Though outmatched by Khan's superior strength, Kirk pulls an odd rod-like tool (never seen before or since, in this episode or the entire series) from <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> uses it as a club to knock the superman unconscious.|$|E
