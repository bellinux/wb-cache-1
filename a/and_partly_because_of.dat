5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{development}} of the linen industry, Ireland was largely passed over by the industrial revolution, partly because it lacked coal and iron resources <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the impact of the sudden union with the structurally superior economy of England, which saw Ireland as a source of agricultural produce and capital.|$|E
5|$|Even so, <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> Sickles's {{unexpected}} location, Longstreet's assault did {{not proceed}} according to Lee's plan. Instead of wheeling left {{to join a}} simultaneous two-division push {{on either side of}} the Emmitsburg Road, Hood's division attacked in a more easterly direction than intended, and McLaws's and Anderson's divisions deployed brigade by brigade, in an en echelon style of attack, also heading more to the east than the intended northeast.|$|E
5|$|Leith {{spent seven}} months of {{recording}} and writing and worked with Bryon Jones, James Roche and Ross Fraser. Initially, he wanted the album {{to be released in}} March, but it was pushed back to August, partly due to the prolonged success of The Winner's Journey <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the large amount of songs they had to cull.|$|E
50|$|The {{study is}} unique <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the long time {{span of the}} cohort, <b>and</b> also <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the high social status {{of some of the}} study participants.|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow awarded the album four stars and said [...] "all {{of the songs}} sound quite fresh, {{partly due to the}} unusual {{instrumentation}} <b>and</b> also <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the players' inventiveness".|$|R
50|$|Kästner {{began to}} publish less <b>and</b> less, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his {{increasing}} alcoholism. He {{did not join}} any of the post-war literary movements in West Germany, and in the 1950s and 1960s he came to be perceived mainly as an author of children's books.|$|R
5|$|After graduating, Synge {{decided that}} he wanted to be a {{professional}} musician and went to Germany to study music. He stayed in Coblenz during 1893 and moved to Würzburg in January 1894. Partly because he was shy about performing in public, <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> doubt about his ability, he decided to abandon music and pursue his literary interests. He returned to Ireland in June 1894, and moved to Paris in January 1895 to study literature and languages at the Sorbonne.|$|E
5|$|Partly {{because of}} {{theoretical}} and mathematical difficulties <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the extremely high energies (beyond what is technologically {{possible for the}} foreseeable future) needed to test these theories experimentally, there is so far no experimental evidence that would unambiguously point {{to any of these}} models being a correct fundamental description of nature. This has led some in the community to criticize these approaches to unification and question the value of continued research on these problems.|$|E
5|$|The leading Western economies adopted Keynes's policy {{recommendations}} before {{the outbreak of}} World War II, and in the two decades following Keynes's death in 1946, almost all capitalist governments had done so. Keynes's influence waned in the 1970s, {{partly as a result}} of the stagflation that plagued the Anglo-American economies during that decade, <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> criticism of Keynesian policies by Milton Friedman and other monetarists. He and other economists had disputed the ability of government to regulate the business cycle favourably with fiscal policy.|$|E
30|$|The {{pursuit of}} the typological aspect of these goals in {{systemic}} linguistics has, however, been slow, partly due to practical reasons (see Caffarel et al. 2004 : Ch. 1 for details), <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> description <b>of</b> individual languages antedates language typology of the kind described here.|$|R
2500|$|He worried, {{along with}} William Hague, about the {{possibility}} of English nationalism: [...] "As we move into this new century, people's sense of Englishness will become more articulated <b>and</b> that's <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the mirror that devolution provides us with and because we're becoming more European at the same time." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{meditation}} on the obvious inference was indulged in by all, and during its continuance each directed his vision into the ashpit, which glowed like a desert in the tropics under a vertical sun, shaping their eyes long <b>and</b> liny, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the light, <b>partly</b> from {{the depth of the}} subject discussed.|$|R
5|$|As {{with other}} media, {{newspapers}} were {{controlled by the}} state, with the Reich Press Chamber shutting down or buying newspapers and publishing houses. By 1939, over {{two thirds of the}} newspapers and magazines were directly owned by the Propaganda Ministry. The NSDAP daily newspaper, the Völkischer Beobachter ("Ethnic Observer"), was edited by Alfred Rosenberg, author of The Myth of the Twentieth Century, a book of racial theories espousing Nordic superiority. Goebbels controlled the wire services and insisted that all newspapers in Germany only publish content favourable to the regime. His propaganda ministry issued two dozen directives every week on exactly what news should be published and what angles to use; the typical newspaper followed the directives closely. Newspaper readership plummeted, partly because of the decreased quality of the content <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the surge in popularity of radio.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the Talbot Group was {{merged into}} Peugeot within PSA, and {{responsibility}} for the model was devolved to France. The Whitley design studio was dissolved, {{and some of the}} designers crossed over to British Leyland, where they joined their former boss Roy Axe. PSA had by then already started work on a replacement for the Samba, based on the Citroën AX, a few prototypes of which—essentially rebadged AXs—were created in 1983/84. The Samba sold reasonably well throughout 1982 and 1983, after which sales began to suffer, partly because of the model's aging <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> competition from the very popular Peugeot 205, which created powerful (and successful) internal competition within PSA for the little Talbot.|$|E
5|$|When {{continental}} glaciers {{moved over}} the Rove Formation area, the ice was a hundreds of meters thick and its surface sloped gently southward from the Patrician center to the north. The {{base of the}} ice sheet encountered the cuesta topography relief {{of a few hundred}} feet. Because the ice over the valleys would be thicker than the ice over the ridges, obstructed extrusion flow would operate and resulted in the removal of the easily quarried slates of the valleys. The ridges would not be appreciably eroded, partly because the ice would be thinner over the ridges and therefore less plastic, <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the resistance of the diabase to both quarrying and abrasion by the ice.|$|E
5000|$|We {{supported}} Reza Shah, and {{we wanted}} to support his effort to create a modern nation state, to lift us from our backwardness. At this time we talked about Pan-Iraniasm, or reuniting Afghanistan with Iran. We also talked of nationalism.

50|$|Numbers {{of these}} birds have been declining sharply in recent decades, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{commercial}} fishing for bearded goby, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> increasing human disturbance, <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> numbers <b>of</b> kelp gulls have been increasing <b>because</b> <b>of</b> human provisioning, and the gulls are active predators on the cormorant eggs and chicks. The world population is probably now around 4,000 birds. The most important population centres are in Mercury Island and Ichaboe Island in Namibia.|$|R
50|$|If red, blue, {{and green}} light (the {{additive}} primaries) are mixed, {{the result is}} something close to white light (see Prism (optics)). Painting is inherently subtractive, but Pointillist colors often seem brighter than typical mixed subtractive colors. This may be <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> subtractive mixing <b>of</b> the pigments is avoided, <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> some <b>of</b> the white canvas may be showing between the applied dots.|$|R
5|$|Turkish cuisine is {{regarded}} as one of the most prominent in the world, its popularity is largely owed to the cultural influences of the Ottoman Empire <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its major tourism industry. It is largely the heritage of Ottoman cuisine, which can be described as a fusion and refinement of Central Asian, Caucasian, Middle Eastern, Mediterranean and Balkan cuisines. The country's position between the East and the Mediterranean Sea helped the Turks gain complete control of major trade routes, and an ideal environment allowed plants and animals to flourish. Turkish cuisine was well established by the mid-1400s, the beginning of the Ottoman Empire's six hundred-year reign. Yogurt salads, fish in olive oil, and stuffed and wrapped vegetables became Turkish staples. The empire, eventually spanning from Austria to northern Africa, used its land and water routes to import exotic ingredients from all over the world. By the end of the 16th century, the Ottoman court housed over 1,400 live-in cooks and passed laws regulating the freshness of food. Since the fall of the empire in World War I (1914–1918) and the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923, foreign food such as French hollandaise sauce and western fast food have made their way into the modern Turkish diet.|$|E
5|$|Until its repeal, most {{extensions}} to {{copyright law}} were based around provisions {{found in the}} Statute of Anne. The one successful bill from the lobbying in the 1730s, which came into force on 29 September 1739, extended the provision prohibiting the import of foreign books to also prohibit the import of books that, while originally published in Britain, were being reprinted in foreign nations and then shipped to England and Wales. This was intended to stop the influx of cheap books from Ireland, and also repealed the price restrictions in the Statute of Anne. Another alteration was over the legal deposit provisions of the Statute, which many booksellers found unfair. Despite an initial period of compliance, the principle of donating copies of books to certain libraries lapsed, {{partly due to the}} unwieldiness of the statute's provisions <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> a lack of cooperation by the publishers. In 1775 Lord North, who was Chancellor of the University of Oxford, succeeded in passing a bill that reiterated the legal deposit provisions and granted the universities perpetual copyright on their works.|$|E
5|$|Nigel Kneale {{had been}} unhappy with Hammer's {{adaptation}} of The Quatermass Experiment, {{partly because he}} received no extra remuneration {{from the sale of}} the film rights <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the changes made in the film to his original television script. In the wake of his dissatisfaction, Kneale exerted pressure on the BBC to allow him to be more involved in the sale of the rights to his work. Despite being in the final months of his BBC contract, Kneale was allowed to collaborate with Hammer on the adaptation of Quatermass II. The first draft of the screenplay was written by Kneale with input from producer Anthony Hinds. Subsequent drafts were worked on by director Val Guest, as he had done before on The Quatermass Xperiment. Guest recalled of Kneale's script that there was “lots of philosophising and very down-to-earth thinking but it was too long, it would not have held screenwise. So, again, I had to tailor it and sharpen it and hopefully not ruin it”. The script was submitted to the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) in April 1956. BBFC reader Audrey Field commented, “There should be the customary general caution that the sky is not the limit, either in sights or sounds”. The BBFC's main objection was to a scene in which a guard from the Winnerden Flats complex murders a family having a picnic. This scene was omitted from the final film, although it is present in the original television presentation.|$|E

In August 2005, {{the company}} also acquired six 11.3m Tridents from NWFB and numbered them 748-753. This was the largest bus acquisition of KCRC since its first purchase of buses back in 1987, <b>and</b> was <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the retirement of that particular batch of buses.|$|R
50|$|Hohensaaten {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in 1258. The village belonged to Barnim district. After a year-long dispute between municipal board <b>and</b> citizens, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> averse to the Barnim district, {{the treaty of}} mergeance with city of Bad Freienwalde was signed on 14 November 2008.

50|$|Much of the humour, {{charm and}} {{enthusiastic}} optimism mentioned in his many obituaries still comes {{across from the}} friendly, lucid style of his two most famous books, whose 'point of view', according to his Preface to The Grandeur that was Rome, 'is that of humanity and the progress of civilisation'. The books were ground-breaking <b>and</b> successful <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> their popular as well as scholarly approach <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> they included what were then newly sumptuous photographic illustrations.|$|R
5|$|The {{relative}} freedom {{which the}} Republic of Venice afforded him, {{compared to the}} problems of court politics in Mantua, are reflected in Monteverdi's letters to Striggio, particularly his letter of 13 March 1620, when he rejects an invitation to return to Mantua, extolling his present position and finances in Venice, and referring to the pension which Mantua still owes him. Nonetheless, remaining a Mantuan citizen, he accepted commissions from the new Duke Ferdinando, who had formally renounced his position as Cardinal in 1616 to take on the duties of state. These included the balli Tirsi e Clori (1616) and Apollo (1620), an opera Andromeda (1620) and an intermedio, Le nozze di Tetide, for the marriage of Ferdinando with Caterina de' Medici (1617). Most of these compositions were extensively delayed in creation – partly, as shown by surviving correspondence, through the composer's unwillingness to prioritise them, <b>and</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> constant changes in the court's requirements. They are now lost, apart from Tirsi e Clori, which was included in the seventh book of madrigals (published 1619) and dedicated to the Duchess Caterina, for which the composer received a pearl necklace from the Duchess. A subsequent major commission, the opera La finta pazza Licori, to a libretto by Giulio Strozzi, was completed for Fernando's successor Vincenzo II, who succeeded to the dukedom in 1626. Because of the latter's illness (he died in 1627), it was never performed, and it is now also lost.|$|E

50|$|Rhodes was {{included}} on Granta's Best of Young British Novelists list in 2003, {{to his own}} bemusement <b>and</b> frustration, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> Granta's selection methods ("It's one thing to judge a writer by stuff they've written, but to judge them on stuff they're going to write is lunacy") but also <b>because</b> some <b>of</b> the others on the list {{failed to respond to}} his request to sign a joint statement protesting against the Iraq war.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his time}} Lorenz was {{considered}} to be the leading expert in Wagnerian form. [...] His formal ideas regarding Wagner's operas were enormously influential; McClatchie suggests that by 1952, Lorenz's formal conception of Wagner's operas was almost [...] "universally accepted." [...] More recently, however, Lorenz's theories have been roundly dismissed by scholars on purely analytical grounds, <b>and</b> only <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> Lorenz's association with the Nazi party and the ideological bias of his work.|$|R
2500|$|Though moai are whole-body statues, {{they are}} erroneously {{referred}} to as [...] "Easter Island heads" [...] in some popular literature.
