In 1927 Clemson received accreditation from the Association of Secondary Schools and Colleges of the Southern States.|$|E

2500|$|With Finland's {{independence}} {{achieved in}} 1917, {{there was a}} {{turn away from the}} Jugendstil style, which became associated with bourgeois culture. In turn there was a brief return to classicism, so-called Nordic Classicism, influenced to an extent by architect study trips to Italy, but also by key examples from Sweden, in particular the architecture of Gunnar Asplund. Notable Finnish architects from this period include J. S. Sirén and Gunnar Taucher, as well as the early work of Alvar Aalto, Erik Bryggman, Martti Välikangas, Hilding Ekelund and Pauli E. Blomstedt. The most notable large scale building from this period was the Finnish Parliament building (1931) by Sirén. Other key buildings built in this style were the Finnish Language Adult Education Centre in Helsinki (1927) by Taucher (with key assistance from P.E. Blomstedt), Vyborg Art Museum and Drawing School (1930) by Uno Ullberg, [...] "Taidehalli" [...] Art Gallery, Helsinki (1928) and Töölö Church, Helsinki (1930) by Hilding Ekelund, and several buildings by Alvar Aalto, in particular the Workers' Club, Jyväskylä (1925), the South-West Finland <b>Agricultural</b> <b>building,</b> Turku (1928), Muuramäki Church (1929) and the early version of the Vyborg Library (1927–35) before Aalto greatly modified his design in line with the emerging Functionalist style.|$|E
