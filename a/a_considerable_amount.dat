50|$|Huge {{semantic}} {{gaps between}} theoretical insights, formulated aglorithms, programming languages and hardware pose {{a challenge to}} efficient implementations of even simple algorithms, because small implementation details can have rippling effects on execution behavior.The only reliable way to compare several implementations of an algorithm is to spend <b>an</b> <b>considerable</b> <b>amount</b> of time on tuning and profiling, running those algorithms on multiple architectures, {{and looking at the}} generated machine code.|$|R
5|$|There {{has been}} {{criticism}} {{from a number}} of people that the highly fragmented DG structure wastes <b>a</b> <b>considerable</b> <b>amount</b> of time in s as the different departments and Commissioners compete with each other.

5|$|The film gained <b>a</b> <b>considerable</b> <b>amount</b> of {{attention}} before its release, forming large fanbases online and becoming an Internet phenomenon, {{due to the}} film's title, casting, and premise. In response to the Internet fan base, New Line Cinema incorporated feedback from online users into its production, and added five days of reshooting. Before and after the film was released, it was parodied and alluded to on television shows and films, fan-made videos, video games, and various forms of literature.|$|E
60|$|Leaving this {{discussion}} apart, {{we have a}} matter of business to communicate to the reader.

The process of being washed in the night air, and rough-dried in a closet, is as dangerous as it is peculiar. Mr. Pickwick was laid up with an attack of rheumatism.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the antioxidant activity of Coreopsis tinctoria flowering tops (CTFT). Studies were conducted to obtain suitable extraction conditions for chlorogenic acid, quercetin, luteolin, apigenin and kaempferol, which were identified and quantified by HPLC. Response surface methodology was employed to optimise the ultrasound-assisted extraction conditions including extraction time, ethanol concentration and liquid-solid ratio. The antioxidant activity of the extracts was analysed using various antioxidant models, such as DPPH, ABTS and hydroxyl radical scavenging assay. CTFT extracted for 15. 0 min with ethanol at a concentration of 60. 4 % and with liquidsolid ratio 27. 5 : 1 possessed <b>a</b> <b>considerable</b> <b>amounts</b> of total flavonoids and polyphenols (18. 9 %). This extract showed higher scavenging activity of ABTS and hydroxyl radical activity than rutin, however not in the DPPH test. We may assume that CTFT possess antioxidant and free radical scavenging potentials...|$|R

Inexperience told and by December 1940 NGJ 2 had lost 32 aircrew killed in action and 12 aircraft lost in exchange for 18 RAF aircraft claimed shot down. Despite the claims made by German crews, evidence showed <b>a</b> <b>considerable</b> <b>amount</b> of over claiming, and the difficulty in substantiating claims at night and over enemy territory became evident.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>considerable</b> <b>amount</b> of new {{knowledge}} about plant function comes {{from studies of}} the molecular genetics of model plants such as the Thale cress, Arabidopsis thaliana, a weedy species in the mustard family (Brassicaceae). The genome or hereditary information contained in the genes of this species is encoded by about 135 million base pairs of DNA, forming {{one of the smallest}} genomes among flowering plants. Arabidopsis was the first plant to have its genome sequenced, in 2000. The sequencing of some other relatively small genomes, of rice (Oryza sativa) and Brachypodium distachyon, has made them important model species for understanding the genetics, cellular and molecular biology of cereals, grasses and monocots generally.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>considerable</b> <b>amount</b> of {{research}} has been done at Mount Baker over the past decade, and it is now among the most-studied of the Cascade volcanoes. Recent and ongoing projects include gravimetric and GPS-based geodetic monitoring, fumarole gas sampling, tephra distribution mapping, new interpretations of the Schriebers Meadow lava flow, and hazards analyses. Mapping of Carmelo and Sherman craters, and interpretations of the eruptive history, continues, as well. The Mount Baker Volcano Research Center maintains an online archive of abstracts of this work, and an extensive references list, as well as photos.|$|E
