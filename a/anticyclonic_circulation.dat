500|$|Odd {{structures}} {{known as}} polar vortices lie within the cold polar collars. They are giant hurricane-like storms four {{times larger than}} their terrestrial analogs. Each vortex has two [...] "eyes"—the centres of rotation, which are connected by distinct S-shaped cloud structures. Such double eyed structures are also called polar dipoles. Vortices rotate with the period of about 3 days {{in the direction of}} general super-rotation of the atmosphere. The linear wind speeds are 35–50m/s near their outer edges and zero at the poles. The temperature at the cloud-tops in the each polar vortex is much higher than in the nearby polar collars reaching 250K (−23°C). The conventional interpretation of the polar vortices is that they are anticyclones with downwelling in the centre and upwelling in the cold polar collars. This type of circulation resembles a winter polar anticyclonic vortex on Earth, especially the one found over Antarctica. The observations in the various infrared atmospheric windows indicate that the <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>circulation</b> observed near the poles penetrates as deep as to 50km altitude, i.e. {{to the base of the}} clouds. The polar upper troposphere and mesosphere are extremely dynamic; large bright clouds may appear and disappear over the space of a few hours. One such event was observed by Venus Express between 9 and 13 January 2007, when the south polar region became brighter by 30%.

40|$|We analyze {{horizontal}} transport from midlatitudes into the tropics (in-mixing) {{and its impact}} on seasonal variations of ozone, carbon monoxide and water vapor in the Tropical Tropopause Layer (TTL). For this purpose, we use three-dimensional backward trajectories, driven by ECMWF ERA-Interim winds, and a conceptual one-dimensional model of the chemical composition of the TTL. We find that the fraction of in-mixed midlatitude air shows an annual cycle with maximum during NH summer, resulting from the superposition of two inversely phased annual cycles for in-mixing from the NH and SH, respectively. In-mixing is driven by the monsoonal upper-level <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>circulations.</b> This circulation pattern is dominated by the Southeast Asian summer monsoon and, correspondingly, in-mixing shows an annual cycle. The impact of in-mixing on TTL mixing ratios depends on the in-mixed fraction of midlatitude air and on the meridional gradient of the particular species. For CO the meridional gradient and consequently the effect of in-mixing is weak. For water vapor, in-mixing effects are negligible. For ozone, the meridional gradient is large and the contribution of in-mixing to the ozone maximum during NH summer is about 50 %. This in-mixing contribution is not sensitive to the tropical ascent velocity, which is about 40 % too fast in ERA-Interim. As photochemically produced ozone in the TTL shows no distinct summer maximum, the ozone annual anomaly in the upper TTL turns out to be mainly forced by in-mixing of ozone-rich extratropical air during NH summer...|$|R

40|$|The various {{modes of}} {{atmospheric}} mass redistribution characterize the principal {{variations of the}} general circulation of the atmosphere. Interhemispheric exchanges of atmospheric mass occur with considerable regularity on intraseasonal time-scales. Observational evidence from previous studies indicates that anomalous and persistent regional atmospheric mass distributions (e. g., atmospheric blocking) may often be related to interhemispheric atmospheric mass exchange. Using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) /National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) reanalysis, we identify significant events when the northern hemisphere (NH) loses dry atmospheric mass on subseasonal time-scales during the boreal winter from 1968 to 1997. A total of 25 events is found, with a preferred time-scale of 9 days. The linear correlation coefficient between the dry atmospheric mass anomalies for the NH and southern hemisphere (SH) is - 0. 91 for the 25 significant events, indicating very strong interhemispheric compensation and increasing our confidence in the suitability of this dataset {{for the study of}} interhemispheric dry atmospheric mass exchange. Positive sea-level pressure anomalies are found over northern Eurasia, the North Pacific and the North Atlantic prior to the onset of the composite NH dry atmospheric mass collapse event. Over northern Eurasia the positive atmospheric mass anomaly associated with the building of the Siberian high is found to be a statistically significant precursor to the events. The breakdown of NH dry atmospheric mass occurs in association with the decay of the positive atmospheric mass anomaly in the North Pacific as a cyclone deepens explosively in the Gulf of Alaska. Pressure surges over Southeast Asia and North America, associated with statistically significant positive atmospheric mass anomalies, are mechanisms that act to channel the atmospheric mass equatorward on a rapid time-scale (~ 4 days). The dry atmospheric mass increase in the SH is manifested as enhanced surface ridging over the South Pacific and South Indian Oceans. Preferential interhemispheric interaction is found in the region between 100 °E and 130 °E, and over the central Pacific {{in the vicinity of the}} dateline. A prominent channel of southeastward dry atmospheric mass flux, emanating from the Australian continent, combined with a southward channel from the equatorial central Pacific, contribute to the atmospheric mass buildup over the South Pacific. The role of a Southeast Asian pressure surge was examined for a representative event. A large evacuation of atmospheric mass from northern Eurasia occurs as the atmospheric mass surges equatorward and into the SH. Along the west coast of Australia, a southerly pressure surge extends equatorward and converges with the northerly surge to create a pronounced near equatorial zonal pressure gradient. A low-level westerly wind burst develops in response to this enhanced zonal pressure gradient as part of the onset of an active phase of the Australian summer monsoon. We show that three prominent <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>circulations</b> intensify in the southern hemisphere extratropics, stretching from the South Indian Ocean to the South Pacific, beneath regions of upper tropospheric dry atmospheric mass convergence, originating from the monsoon convection outflow. These <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>circulations</b> are largely responsible for the dry atmospheric mass increase in the SH...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Hawaiian Islands {{experience}} damaging wildfires on {{a yearly}} basis. Soil moisture {{or lack thereof}} influences the amount and flammability of vegetation. Incorporating daily maximum temperatures and daily rainfall amounts, the Keetch–Byram Drought Index (KBDI) estimates the amount of soil moisture by tracking daily maximum temperatures and rainfall. A previous study found a strong link between the KBDI and total area burned on the four main Hawaiian Islands. The present paper further examines the natural variability of the KBDI. The times of year at which the KBDI is highest, representing the highest fire danger, are found {{at each of the}} 27 stations on the island chain. Spectral analysis is applied to investigate the variability of the KBDI on longer time scales. Windward and leeward stations are shown to have different sensitivities to large-scale climatic fluctuations. An El Niño signal displays a strong relationship with leeward stations, when examined with a band-pass filter and with a composite of standardized anomalies. Departure patterns of atmospheric circulations and sea surface temperatures over the North Pacific are investigated for composites of extremely high KBDI values when fire risk is high. The winter, spring, and fall show anomalous surface <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>circulations,</b> surface divergence, and subsidence over the islands for the upper quartile of KBDI. The winter, spring, and fall composites of equatorial sea surface temperatures for the upper quartile of KBDI are investigated for possible links to atmospheric circulations.

40|$|The early {{response}} of the atmosphere–ocean system to meltwater runoff originating from the Greenland ice sheet is studied using a coupled atmosphere–ocean general circulation model (AOGCM). For this purpose, AOGCM ensemble simulations without and with associated ocean freshening around Greenland are compared. For freshwater perturbations initiated in northern winter, the mean response {{for the first three}} months shows the emergence of negative sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the Denmark Strait, in association with enhanced oceanic advection by the East Greenland Current. The response also shows negative SST anomalies in the North Atlantic associated with enhanced westerlies at the ocean surface. Additionally, the baroclinic atmospheric cyclonic circulation east of Greenland intensifies, and <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>circulations</b> with equivalent barotropic structures develop over western Europe and the North Pacific Ocean. Simulations by the atmospheric component of the AOGCM indicate that atmosphere–ocean interactions contribute significantly to enhance the response. The sensitivity of the coupled system response to the timing of freshwater perturbation is also studied. For freshwater perturbations initialized in northern summer, the response during the following winter is similar, but stronger in magnitude. In the Northern Hemisphere, the atmospheric response resembles the Arctic Oscillation (AO) mode of variability. The association between anomalies in the Denmark Strait SSTs and in the atmosphere east of Greenland is consistent with that observed during previous great salinity anomaly (GSA) events. The results obtained highlight the importance of atmosphere–ocean interaction in the early climate response to Greenland melting, the teleconnections with the North Pacific and the contribution of GSA events to North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) variability...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, it {{has become}} widely {{accepted}} that the upper oceanic heat content (OHC) in advance of a hurricane is generally superior to pre-storm sea surface temperature (SST) for indicating favorable regions for hurricane intensification and maintenance. The OHC is important because a hurricane's surface winds mix the upper ocean and entrain cooler water into the oceanic mixed layer from below, subsequently cooling the sea surface in the region providing heat energy to the storm. For a given initial SST, increased OHC typically decreases the wind-induced sea surface cooling, and a warm ocean eddy has a higher OHC than its surroundings, so the argument is often made that conditions become more favorable for a hurricane to intensify when the storm's core encounters a warm ocean eddy. When considering hurricane intensity, one often neglected aspect of a warm ocean eddy is the <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>circulation</b> in the eddy that exists due to the geostrophic adjustment of the density and velocity fields. Depending on the translation speed of the hurricane {{and the location of}} the eddy relative to the storm track, this <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>circulation</b> may impact the location and magnitude of the hurricane-induced sea surface cooling. Using a version of the Princeton Ocea...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{attempt is}} made to explain the fixed {{locations}} of coastal upwelling centers in the Gulf of Lions {{as a function of}} the coastline geometry alone. The semi-implicit numerical model, based on two-layer shallow water equations, uses a spatial discretization with triangular finite elements. Vertical mixing is shown to play an important role in determining the final shape of the upwelling centers. It is conjectured that an observed upwelling filament results from the straining and stretching of a coastal upwelling center by the observed <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>circulation</b> farther offshore...|$|E
40|$|The {{frequency}} of occurrence of cloud cover was analysed taking into consideration its circulation-related conditioning. The atmospheric circulation types according to Osuchowska-Klein (1978) classification were used. The study was made based on diurnal climatological observations carried out in Poznań-Ławica in years 1966 – 1998. It {{was found that the}} cloudless skies and small cloudiness were associated with anticyclonic types of atmospheric circulation and the east macrotype. Moderate cloudiness occurred equally at cyclonic and <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>circulation</b> types. Larger cloud coverage of the sky was associated with cyclonic circulation, especially with the west macrotype...|$|E
40|$|This study {{identified}} {{the causes of}} the nonoccurrence of tropical cyclones (TCs) in August 2014 by examining large-scale environments. First, over the previous 30 years, the TC genesis frequency in August showed an overall statistically significant decline. In the tropical and subtropical western Pacific, the outgoing longwave radiation anomaly index also exhibited an overall increase until recently. Regarding precipitable water and precipitation, an analysis was performed on the difference between the mean values for August 2014 and the mean values for August over the previous 30 years. As a result, while convective activities were suppressed in the tropical and subtropical western Pacific, convective activities were strong in the mid-latitudes of East Asia. This indicates that while the western North Pacific summer monsoon was weakened in August 2014, the East Asian summer monsoon was strengthened. The weakening of the western North Pacific summer monsoon may have made it difficult for TCs to occur. An analysis of 850 hPa and 500 hPa stream flows showed the strengthening of anomalous huge <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>circulations</b> in the tropical and subtropical western Pacific, whereas anomalously cyclonic circulations were reinforced in the mid-latitudes of East Asia. This was associated with the result that the western North Pacific subtropical high (WNPSH) showed further westward and southward expansion in August 2014 compared to the climatological mean WNPSH. Therefore, TCs were unlikely to occur in the tropical and subtropical western Pacific, but anomalous cold northerlies and anomalous warm southerlies converged in the Japanese Islands after originating in China’s central region and passing the East China Sea. Therefore, a favorable environment for the occurrence of precipitation had been formed...|$|R
40|$|An index {{capturing}} the anomalies of the zonal wind at 925 hPa from 1950 to 2010 was defined {{to explore the}} relationship between the fluctuations of the Caribbean low-level jet (CLLJ) and the main climate variability modes affecting the Intra-Americas Sea Region. El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, here defined using the Niño 3. 4 index, are found {{to be the most important}} variability modes for the jet anomalies, in agreement with previous studies. However, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Pacific/North American (PNA) teleconnection pattern also show significant correlations with the CLLJ anomaly index during February. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Arctic Oscillation (AO) reveal a possible interaction with the jet anomalies that could be connected with the cold fronts and cold air surges arriving to the Caribbean basin from the Northern Hemisphere during winter. A composite technique is used to explain the correlations with the Pacific indexes. We found that ENSO events are connected to CLLJ anomalies by modulating the sea-level pressure (SLP) near the east coast of the United States and the Aleutian Low. The pattern displayed by the SLP anomalies (SLPa) is also associated with the PNA. During warm (cold) ENSO phases, negative (positive) anomalies in the SLP field over the east coast of North America produce cyclonic (<b>anticyclonic)</b> <b>circulations</b> at low levels. However, the ENSO signal in the SLPa and the PNA pattern are modulated by the phases of the PDO. Results indicate that when the ENSO and PDO are in phase (out of phase), the SLPa signal is enhanced (weakened or cancelled), affecting the CLLJ anomalies in both direction and intensity, also changing the spatial distribution of precipitation.

40|$|Diatoms {{were studied}} quantitatively in six latest Quaternary (~ 70 kyr B. P. to Recent) piston cores from the westernmost Mediterranean, the Alboran Basin, and the Atlantic region {{immediately}} {{to the west of}} the Straits of Gibraltar. The Atlantic cores completely lack diatoms. In the Alboran Basin, diatoms are common from late Stage 3 (~ 27. 5 kyr B. P.) to Termination lb (9 kyr B. P.) and in Recent core tops, but are absent in the other latest Quaternary intervals. Maximum accumulation of diatoms and highest abundance of species normally in sediments associated with increased productivity occurred during the latest Quaternary deglaciation, in the first phase of Termination I (~ 14. 8 kyr B. P.). In the modern Alboran Basin, a region of high biological productivity occurs immediately east of the Gibraltar Straits. This high productivity results from upwelling associated with the interaction between the Atlantic inflow and the bottom topography near the Spanish coast. The upwelled nutrient-rich waters are then advected to the east and southeast by the surficial <b>anticyclonic</b> gyral <b>circulation.</b> Late Quaternary variations in diatom abundance are considered to reflect changes in this upwelling intensity with highest diatom abundances inferred to result from increased upwelling associated with an intensification of the <b>anticyclonic</b> gyral <b>circulation.</b> Highest inferred upwelling rates occurred during the first phase of latest Quaternary deglaciation. It is possible that an intensification of circulation within the Mediterranean Basin as a whole occurred from late Stage 3 to mid Termination I because widespread hiatus formation has been reported at this time in the Straits of Sicily due to an increase in the formation of intermediate waters. Diatoms were not preserved in other latest Quaternary intervals due to insufficient productivity to counterbalance their dissolution...|$|R
