40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is {{to point to the}} {{possibilities}} of more efficient auditing. In the encirclement of more and more intensive use of computer techniques that help to CAAT all the aims and the volume of auditing do not change when the audit is done in the computer-informatics environment. The computer assisted audit technique (CAATs) can improve the efficiency and productivity of audit procedures. In the computerized information system, the CAATs are the ways in which an auditor can use computer to gather or as help in gathering <b>auditing</b> <b>evidence.</b> There are more reasons why the auditors apply computer techniques that help in auditing. Most often, they do it to achieve improvement of auditing efficiency when the data volume is large. It depends on several factors whether the auditors will apply the computer techniques that help auditing and to what degree respectively. If they do it, the most important are the computer knowledge, professional skill, experience of auditors, and availability of computer technique, and adequacy of computer supports, infeasibility of hand tests, efficiency and time limit. Through several examples from practice, we showed the possibilities of ACL as one of the CAAT tools...|$|R
40|$|Minor {{traumatic}} brain injury accounts {{for the majority of}} the one million head trauma attendances at A&E departments in the United Kingdom. Guidelines have been established listing criteria for skull films, admission to hospital, computed tomography, and neurosurgical consultation. These are currently undergoing revision and were the subject of a satellite symposium to the J Douglas Miller memorial meeting held in October 1996 in Edinburgh. In the East Anglia Region the current guidelines have been issued as memo-cards for A&E officers. The aim of admission is to observe for deterioration, predominantly caused by intracranial haematomas. The indicators for the development of such lesions are an impaired level of consciousness and presence of a skull fracture. Such patients should therefore undergo regular and frequent neurological observations, and be admitted for at least 12 hours. Following discharge, routine follow up should be considered to identify and treat patients with postconcussion symptoms and signs. The possible way forward for the management of these patients is adopting a greater emphasis on preventative aspects, and establishing, implementing, and <b>auditing</b> <b>evidence</b> based guidelines.

40|$|The major {{corporate}} collapses {{and related}} frauds which occurred in Nigeria {{and around the}} world have raised doubts about the credibility of the operating and financial reporting practices of quoted companies in Nigeria. This stirred a number of professional and regulatory organisations to recommend reforms that will improve transparency in financial reporting and thereby increase audit quality and corporate governance practices. Although evidence of corporate governance practices and audit quality exists from developed economies, very scanty studies have been conducted in Nigeria where corporate governance is just evolving. Therefore, this study provides evidence on corporate governance, audit quality, and firm related attributes from a developing country, Nigeria. Logistic regression was used in investigating the questions that were raised in the study. Findings from the study show that ownership by non- executive director has the possibility of increasing the quality of <b>auditing.</b> <b>Evidence</b> also exist that size of the company and business leverage are important factors in audit quality for companies quoted on the Nigerian Stock Exchange.

40|$|ISO 9001 {{demands of}} (software) {{organizations}} that a rigorous demonstration of their software processes be implemented {{and a set}} of guidelines followed at various levels of abstraction. What these organizations need to show, in other words, is that their software processes have been designed and implemented in a way that allows for a level of configuration and operation that complies with ISO 9001 requirements. For software organizations needing ISO 9001 certification, it is important that they establish a software process life cycle that can manage the requirements imposed by this certification standard. However, software organizations that develop their software products using the agile software processes, such as Extreme Programming (agile-XP), face a number of challenges in their effort to demonstrate that their process activities conform to ISO 9001 requirements, major ones being: product construction, traceability, and measurement. Agile software organizations must provide evidence of ISO 9001 conformity, and they need to develop their own procedures, tools, and methodologies to do so. As yet, there is no consensus on how to audit the agile software organization to ensure that their software processes have been designed and implemented in conformity with ISO 9001 requirements. Moreover, it is challenging to ensure that such lightweight documentation methodologies meet these requirements for certification purposes. The motivation of this research is to help software organizations that use agile software processes in their effort to meet the ISO 9001 certification requirements. This research project is also aimed at helping IS auditors extract <b>auditing</b> <b>evidence</b> that demonstrates conformity to the ISO 9001 requirements that must be met by agile software organizations. Extreme programming (agile-XP) has been selected for improvement as a candidate agile process. This selection was based on the literature indicating a higher adoption of agile-XP over other agile software processes. The goal of this research project is to improve the ability of the agile-XP process to meet the auditing requirements of ISO 9001. The goal of the research also focuses on helping agile software organizations in their effort to become ISO 9001 certified. The main objective of this research project is to design an auditing model that covers the measurement and traceability requirements of ISO 9001. The auditing model should provide IS auditors with <b>auditing</b> <b>evidence</b> that the software projects developed with the agile-XP process have fulfilled the requirements of ISO 9001. The objective also proposes several sub processes to enhance the early planning activities of agile-XP according to ISO 9001 requirements. To achieve these objectives, the main phases of the research methodology are: Investigation of the capability of agile-XP to achieve the requirements of ISO 9001 software process certification; modification of the early phases of agile-XP (i. e. release planning phase) using CMMI-DEV; and design of an auditing model for ISO 9001 traceability and measurement requirements. The main outcome of this research study, which is an auditing model that is aligned with the principles of agile-XP and focuses on ISO 9001 traceability and measurement requirements to provide the IS auditors with a methodological approach for the auditing process.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop a {{taxonomy}} of the major factors that influence auditors' selection and assessment of evidential cues. A discussion of how future research can help extend the taxonomy is also offered. Design/methodology/approach – A literature review of prior research on auditors' utilization of evidential cues is introduced, followed by a summary taxonomy of the variables influencing this decision. Then, an exploration of future research directions is introduced. Findings – A four-category taxonomy is designed. Auditors' decision to incorporate a certain piece of evidence is a function of one or more categories of factors: individual, environmental, task related, or related to the nature of the cues. With its emphasis on audit quality, and thus on enhanced evidence gathering, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) has the potential to alter and/or expand the structure of the proposed taxonomy. Research limitations/implications – The taxonomy is based mainly on prior research in accounting and auditing. Incorporating other research on evidence selection and utilization from human behavior and human psychology may enhance the model. Originality/value – The paper integrates into a model a large body of research on evidential cue selection and use in auditing. The taxonomy is a convenient starting point for researchers attempting to locate prior research in this area. Additionally, the taxonomy is an important guideline for audit partners and managers when planning an audit for two reasons. First, it sheds the light on many variables audit partners and managers need to consider when assigning audit tasks to audit team members with various levels of expertise.
