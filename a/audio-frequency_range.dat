40|$|The {{problem of}} the rigid-piston {{radiator}} mounted in an infinite baffle has been studied widely for tutorial {{as well as for}} practical reasons. The resulting theory is commonly applied to model a loudspeaker in the <b>audio-frequency</b> <b>range.</b> A special function, the Struve function H 3 ̆csub 3 ̆e 13 ̆c/sub 3 ̆e(z), occurs in the expressions for the rigid-piston radiator. This Struve function is not readily available in programs such as Matlab or Mathcad, nor in computer languages such as FORTRAN and C. Therefore a simple and effective approximation of H 3 ̆csub 3 ̆e 13 ̆c/sub 3 ̆e(z) which is valid for all z is developed. Some examples of the application of the Struve function in acoustics are presented. © 2003 Acoustical Society of America...|$|E
40|$|The {{dielectric}} properties of lunar fines 74241, 2 in the <b>audio-frequency</b> <b>range</b> under lunarlike conditions are presented. Results suggest that volatiles are released during {{storage and transport}} of the lunar sample. Apparently, subsequent adsorption of volatiles on the sample surface alters its dielectric response. The assumed volatile influence disappears after evacuation. A comparison of the {{dielectric properties}} of lunar and terrestrial materials {{as a function of}} density, temperature, and frequency indicates that if the terrestrial sample analyzed were completely devoid of atmospheric moisture, it would present dielectric losses smaller than those of the lunar sample. It is concluded that density prevails over temperature as the controlling factor of dielectric permittivity in the lunar regolith and that dielectric losses vary slowly with depth...|$|E

The {{results indicated that}} dielectric dispersion occurred in glassy Se 70 Te 20 Sn 10 alloy. Well-defined dielectric peaks were obtained in glassy Se 70 Te 20 Sn 10 alloy; these are rarely observed in chalcogenide glasses. Such loss peaks were not observed in the glassy Se 80 -xTe 20 Snx system {{in the past for}} Sn concentrations of x ≤ 8. A detailed analysis of the data showed that the results could be explained in terms of dipolar relaxation, with a distribution of relaxation times, This is quite expected in the case of chalcogenide glasses. 1...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a report on {{analyses}} and experiments of the electromechanical filter emiployed tuning-forks with couplers. The composition of this filter is simple: it is composed of two identical tuning-forks coupled each other with fiexural and torsional vibrating couplers. The filter whose center-frequency is situated in <b>audio-frequency</b> <b>range</b> from 0. 1 to 20 KC {{is expected to be}} put to practical use hereafter, since the tuning-fork is suitable for use in this frequency range. This filter of coupler type has a merit of obtaining wider band-characteristic than that of the differential-connection-type filter, and it is able to be analyzed easily for the symmetry of its equivalent network. 　In the first, the various constructions of the filter are described. Then the theoretical analyses are explained on the narrow band filter of the simple construction of only two tuning-forks and couplers, and on the wide band filter obtained by the method of impedance-transformation. Lastly, a few experimental results on these mechanical filters are shown...|$|E
40|$|A small-signal {{amplifier}} {{with two}} identical JFETs in Darlington pair is proposed and qualitatively analyzed {{perhaps for the}} first time. Unlike CS-JFET amplifiers, the voltage gain of this amplifier is significantly higher than unity. In addition, this amplifier can also be tuned in the specific range of audible frequency extended from 90 Hz to 19 KHz. Tuning performance makes this amplifier suitable to use in Radio and TV receivers. An additional biasing resistance RA, ranging in 3 KΩ to 1 MΩ, is to be essentially used in the proposed circuit to maintain its voltage/current amplification property. With this additional biasing resistance, the proposed amplifier crops considerably wide bandwidth (12. 365 MHz), significantly high current gain (530. 909) and fairly high voltage gain (9. 108) in 1 - 80 mV input signal range at 1 KHz frequency. These properties offer a flexible application range to the proposed amplifier as high power gain, wide band, or tuned amplifier in permissible <b>audio-frequency</b> <b>range.</b> Variations in voltage gain {{as a function of}} frequency and different biasing resistances, temperature dependency of performance parameters, bandwidth and total harmonic distortion of the amplifier are also perused to provide a wide spectrum to the qualitative studie...|$|E
40|$|National audienceIn {{the last}} decade, the inverse {{characterization}} of the macroscopic parameters of acoustic porous materials has increased in popularity due to its simplicity. Different techniques in the frequency and time domains have been proposed using ultrasound and audio frequencies. These techniques {{can be divided into}} two categories: iterative inversion and non-iterative inversion techniques. For both categories, the precursor model on which the inversion applies is generally based on an equivalent fluid theory where the porous medium is assumed homogeneous and acoustically rigid or limp. During experimentations, these assumptions may not be verified and other problems related to boundary conditions, measurement quality, and applicability of the precursor model can occur. Without any precautions, one can easily understand that applying inversion techniques can then yield non- physical macroscopic parameters. After giving an overview of the different acoustical inversion techniques, this presentation addresses the importance of defining some guidelines to ensure a better use of the inversion techniques, mainly those based on impedance tube measurements in the <b>audio-frequency</b> <b>range.</b> These guidelines are used to address some case studies on materials for which inversion works and for some others where it fails...|$|E

40|$|A new circuit {{model of}} a small-signal {{amplifier}} is proposed and analyzed on the qualitative scale. Apart from routine biasing components, the proposed amplifier circuit uses two additional biasing resistances and three dissimilar active devices namely MOSFET, JFET and BJT in Triple Darlington configuration. Having a considerably low amount of distortion (0. 71 %), the proposed circuit successfully amplifies small-signals of 1 - 5 mV range (at 1 KHz frequency) and simultaneously provides high voltage gain (189. 846) and high current gain (16. 542 K) with moderate range bandwidth (369. 529 KHz). These properties offer a flexible application range to the proposed circuit as high voltage gain or high current gain or high power gain amplifier in permissible <b>audio-frequency</b> <b>range.</b> Variations in voltage gain {{as a function of}} frequency and different biasing resistances, temperature dependency of performance parameters, bandwidth and total harmonic distortion of the amplifier are perused to provide a wide spectrum to the qualitative studies. Qualitative performance of the proposed amplifier is also compared with two different circuits which are respectively having BJT-JFET and BJT-MOSFET in Darlington pair configuration. The proposed amplifier may be useful for those applications where high voltage and current gain would be the prime requirement of amplification in audio frequency region...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{primarily}} concerned {{with the problem of}} break-squeal in disc brakes, using moulded organic disc pads. Moulded organic friction materials are complex composites and due to this complexity it was thought that they are unlikely to be of uniform composition. Variation in composition would under certain conditions of the braking system, cause slight changes in its vibrational characteristics thus causing resonance in the high <b>audio-frequency</b> <b>range.</b> Dynamic mechanical propertes appear the most likely parameters to be related to a given composition's tendency to promote squeal. Since it was necessary to test under service conditions a review was made of all the available commercial test instruments but as none were suitable it was necessary to design and develop a new instrument. The final instrument design, based on longitudinal resonance, enabled modulus and damping to be determined over a wide range of temperatures and frequencies. This apparatus has commercial value since it is not restricted to friction material testing. Both used and unused pads were tested and although the cause of brake squeal was not definitely established, the results enabled formulation of a tentative theory of the possible conditions for brake squeal. The presence of a temperature of minimum damping was indicated which may be of use to braking design engineers. Some auxilIary testing was also performed to establish the effect of water, oil and brake fluid and also to determine the effect of the various components of friction materials...|$|E
30|$|It is {{well known}} that an {{induction}} coil is used for surface MT signal measurements. For tunnel EM measurement applications, the length of the induction coil is limited by the narrow tunnel space. A fluxgate sensor is compact, but the noise level and working frequency range are inadequate. Compared to the fluxgate sensor, the noise level of the induction coil is lower in the <b>audio-frequency</b> <b>range.</b> Currently, commercial and laboratory-developed induction coils for the AMT method are mostly thin with a length of generally 1  m and a diameter of approximately 5 – 10  cm. For example, for the Phoenix Geophysics AMTC- 30, the noise level is 1 pT/√Hz at 1  Hz, length is 0.82  m, and diameter is 6  cm. In the case of limited tunnel space, if we integrate three orthogonal induction coils in a small cube, we can measure the AMT signals within a compact area and with low noise levels. The triaxial induction coil allows us to integrate three orthogonal coils in a single assembly with a very high volume utilization factor. A much more compact design of induction coils was proposed by Roux et al. (2008), wherein the coils were thick but short, contrary to the traditional designs wherein the coils were thin but very long. However, the frequency range was not wide enough. Grosz et al. (2011) designed a triaxial induction coil magnetometer to achieve compact size and low power consumption. However, the noise level (12 pT/√Hz at 1  Hz) was too high for geophysical survey applications.|$|E
40|$|Hyperbolic-Sine (Sinh) filters form a {{subclass}} of Externally-Linear-Internally-Non-Linear (ELIN) systems. They {{can handle}} large-signals {{in a low}} power environment under half the capacitor area required by the more popular ELIN Log-domain filters. Their inherent class-AB nature stems from the odd property of the sinh function {{at the heart of}} their companding operation. Despite this early realisation, the Sinh filtering paradigm has not attracted the interest it deserves to date probably due to its mathematical and circuit-level complexity. This Thesis presents an overview of the CMOS weak inversion Sinh filtering paradigm and explains how biomedical systems of low- to <b>audio-frequency</b> <b>range</b> could benefit from it. Its dual scope is to: consolidate the theory behind the synthesis and design of high order Sinh continuous–time filters and more importantly to confirm their micro-power consumption and 100 + dB of DR through measured results presented for the first time. Novel high order Sinh topologies are designed by means of a systematic mathematical framework introduced. They employ a recently proposed CMOS Sinh integrator comprising only p-type devices in its translinear loops. The performance of the high order topologies is evaluated both solely and in comparison with their Log domain counterparts. A 5 th order Sinh Chebyshev low pass filter is compared head-to-head with a corresponding and also novel Log domain class-AB topology, confirming that Sinh filters constitute a solution of equally high DR (100 + dB) with half the capacitor area at the expense of higher complexity and power consumption. The theoretical findings are validated by means of measured results from an 8 th order notch filter for 50 / 60 Hz noise fabricated in a 0. 35 μm CMOS technology. Measured results confirm a DR of 102 dB, a moderate SNR of ~ 60 dB and 74 μW power consumption from 2 V power supply. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{converters}} are {{the most}} accurate standards for the transfer of alternating voltage and current to the equivalent dc quantities. Today, thin-film multijunction thermal converters {{are used in the}} frequency range from 10 Hz up to 1 MHz with measurement uncertainties below 10 "-" 6 in the <b>audio-frequency</b> <b>range.</b> For frequencies below 100 Hz, it is known that the ac-dc transfer differences of thin-film multijunction thermal converters as well as of all other types of thermal converters increase; their origin is believed to be in the temperature oscillation in the converter {{due to the lack of}} integration of the oscillating Joule heat at decreasing frequencies. To explore the low-frequency behaviour of thermal converters, the electric-to-thermal conversion in the heater, the heat transport mechanisms in the thin films and the thermal-to-electric conversion in the thermocouples of the thin-film or planar multijunction thermal converter (PMJTC) have been analysed. The dynamic nonlinear electro-thermal differential problem was solved using the finite element method. The knowledge of the temperature distribution with ac and dc input voltages allows the ac-dc transfer difference #delta#_L_F at low frequencies to be calculated. The temperature dependence of the heater resistance, of the heat transport mechanisms, i. e. radiation and conduction through layer materials and through the air, and of the Seebeck effect was included in the nonlinear model. The accuracy of the model was tested comparing the results of the simulation with those of measurements. Parameters in the simulation were adjusted by the measurement of the sensitivity and the thermal time constant of the manufactured PMJTC. A digital method was used as a reference for the measurements. The uncertainty of this measurement method was investigated.
