5|$|As Hurricane Jeanne moved inland, its inner eyewall dissipated, and {{its outer}} eyewall quickly became less distinct. It turned west-northwestward over the state, curving around the western {{periphery}} of the ridge to its northeast. By 14hours after landfall, Jeanne weakened to tropical storm status near the Tampa Bay area. In western Florida, offshore winds produced <b>a</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> 4.5feet (1.4m) below normal in Cedar Key; however, after the storm passed the area, the onshore winds produced above normal tides. Despite initial forecasts that it would emerge into the Gulf of Mexico, the storm remained over land and continued to slowly weaken. Early on September 27, dry air became entrained into the southern {{periphery of the}} circulation, which diminished the thunderstorms to the south. After turning northward, Jeanne entered southern Georgia and weakened into a tropical depression.|$|E
25|$|Many {{citizens}} were pessimistic towards {{the future of}} Hong Kong and {{the transfer of the}} region's sovereignty. <b>A</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> emigration, which was to last for no less than five years, broke out. At its peak, citizenship of small countries, such as Tonga, was also in great demand.|$|E
25|$|The {{last two}} decades of the 19th century were also marked by the {{development}} of a Haitian intellectual culture. Major works of history were published in 1847 and 1865. Haitian intellectuals, led by Louis-Joseph Janvier and Anténor Firmin, engaged in a war of letters against <b>a</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> racism and Social Darwinism that emerged during this period.|$|E

25|$|In Auckland, fears grew {{that the}} spread of Pai Mārire could unite tribes against {{settlers}} in <b>a</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> religious fanaticism. The problem posed a major challenge for the cash-starved government which, already under pressure from London to release British troops for overseas deployment, had deployed the bulk of available forces in Taranaki and Wanganui, where much of their foe was also aligned with Pai Mārire. Without informing the British commander in New Zealand, General Duncan Cameron, Governor George Grey delegated large powers to McLean to use friendly Māori and local volunteers to put down disturbances and punish Volkner's killers.|$|E
25|$|The RLAF {{struggled}} {{into existence}} {{in the face of}} its enemies, while dealing with its own internal divisions as well as bucking <b>a</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> pilot and aircraft losses. As it expanded from its 1960 foundation, and as the fighting power of the Royal Lao Army was diminished and broken during the 1960s, the RLAF came to carry the weight of the battle against Vietnamese communist invaders and local Pathet Lao insurgents. Despite its continual drain of heavy pilot and aircraft losses, the RLAF grew {{to the point where it}} flew 30,000 combat sorties annually against its enemies in the years 1970 through 1972, as well performing essential logistics duties.|$|E
25|$|During the Nixon years (and {{through the}} 1970s), the liberal {{consensus}} {{began to come}} apart {{with the election of}} Ronald Reagan marking the election of the first non-Keynsian administration and the first application of supply-side economics. The alliance with white Southern Democrats had been lost in the Civil Rights era. While the steady enfranchisement of African Americans expanded the electorate to include many new voters sympathetic to liberal views, it was not quite enough {{to make up for the}} loss of some Southern Democrats. <b>A</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> conservatism rose in response to perceived failures of liberal policies. Organized labor, long a bulwark of the liberal consensus, was past the peak of its power in the US and many unions had remained in favor of the Vietnam War even as liberal politicians increasingly turned against it.|$|E

In Valparaiso in the Florida Panhandle, the hurricane produced wind gusts of up to 100 mph, along with <b>a</b> storm <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> 6 ft. Damage from the storm was relatively minor, totaling to $200,000 (1936 USD, $3.24 million 2013 USD). The hurricane indirectly killed four people when a boat capsized in the Gulf of Mexico.|$|R

500|$|Spin magazine's Grayson Currin rated Oddfellows {{seven out}} of ten, finding that it [...] "presents <b>a</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> ideas, information, and intrigue". Currin felt that the album {{attempted}} to blend both art rock and mainstream rock sounds, but was more successful when aiming solely for experimentation—finding [...] "I Can Almost See Them" [...] and [...] "A Thousand Eyes" [...] to be examples of this. Consequence of Sound writer Len Comaratta awarded Oddfellows three stars out of five, finding that Dunn's bass playing improves the band's sound without altering it radically. Comaratta felt that the album rewarded patient listeners but did not provide memorable hooks or melodies, and compared its [...] "laid back" [...] sound to that of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.|$|E

500|$|The WCPAEB's fourth album [...] was {{released}} in July 1968. The album represented a creative leap forward for the band and is often considered their most accomplished work. Band biographer Tim Forster described Volume 3 as the group's [...] "most extraordinary achievement", one which utilized a [...] "bizarre fusion of innocence and malice" [...] heavily affected by the [...] "exuberance of the British Invasion, folk rock, and flower power-era" [...] being [...] "swept away in <b>a</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> bad drugs, paranoia, and protest". The album also saw Morgan experimenting with the droning quality of the electric sitar, featured prominently on [...] "Ritual #1", [...] "Until the Poorest of People Have Money", the title track, and [...] "Ritual #2". In addition, Volume 3s front cover design showcased the [...] "butterfly mind" [...] artwork of John Van Hamersveld, who also is credited with the covers of Crown of Creation, Exile on Main St., and Magical Mystery Tour. Like the WCPAEB's earlier albums, Volume 3 failed to sell in sufficient quantities to reach the U.S. charts, and Reprise dropped the band.|$|E
500|$|The {{economic}} {{response to}} the vote was swift and decisive. Bryant worked only twice during 1977, and lost most of her paid appearances after that. She had recently finished an album named There's Nothing Like the Love Between a Man and a Woman; record companies chose to not distribute it. Singer Sewing Machines canceled negotiations for a television variety show. She was replaced after ten years of hosting the Orange Bowl Parade by Rita Moreno, who was older and who had recently performed in a gay-themed film, The Ritz. Bryant and Green {{held a press conference}} and claimed Bryant was being blacklisted, and that a national conspiracy was underway by the nation's homosexuals to deprive her of her livelihood. Time magazine called the charge [...] "unlikely", and network executives denied gay pressure was behind their decision. Bryant's claim of being blacklisted brought <b>a</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> condemnation against the perceived pressure by gay organizations. Three major newspapers supported Bryant's right to free speech. Years later, she admitted that some of the statements made about her cancellations were exaggerated for effect, but that the tactic worked against her, as more organizations and companies canceled her performances.|$|E
500|$|The {{hurricane}} {{passed to}} the west of the Florida Keys as a Category 4 hurricane. Its large wind field caused tropical storm force winds to the islands, with the highest wind report being 48 mph (71 km/h) in Key West. Rainfall from the hurricane's outer bands was intermittent, and storm tides of 5 ft (1.5 m) were reported. Further north, Captiva and Sanibel islands were completely inundated with water. In Punta Rassa, the majority of homes were either extensively damaged or washed away. Most highways leading out of Fort Myers were impassible due to high water. Damage to railroad tracks resulted in a suspension of service for three days. On Estero Island, a number of buildings were damaged, including the casinos, cottages, and Crescent Beach resort. The storm also destroyed the mausoleum of Dr. Cyrus Teed, the founder of Koreshanity. Damage in Lee County reached about $1.5 million. Along the Myakka River near Boca Grande, the railroad bridge washed away, while the storm also destroyed two vehicular bridges over the Charlotte Harbor Bay. The streets of Punta Gorda were inundated, where <b>a</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> [...] above normal was recorded. One death occurred in the city due to drowning. At Egmont Key, above normal tides forced 75 people to seek shelter in the lighthouse. The entire island was inundated by water.|$|E

500|$|The {{most obvious}} effect of tidal forces is to cause two bulges in the Earth's oceans, {{one on the}} side facing the Moon {{and the other on}} the side opposite. This results in {{elevated}} sea levels called ocean tides. As the Earth spins on its axis, one of the ocean bulges (high tide) is held in place [...] "under" [...] the Moon, while another such tide is opposite. As a result, there are two high tides, and two low tides in about 24 hours. Since the Moon is orbiting the Earth in the same direction of the Earth's rotation, the high tides occur about every 12 hours and 25 minutes; the 25 minutes is due to the Moon's time to orbit the Earth. The Sun has the same tidal effect on the Earth, but its forces of attraction are only 40% that of the Moon's; the Sun's and Moon's interplay is responsible for spring and neap tides. If the Earth were a water world (one with no continents) it would produce <b>a</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> only one meter, and that tide would be very predictable, but the ocean tides are greatly modified by other effects: the frictional coupling of water to Earth's rotation through the ocean floors, the inertia of water's movement, ocean basins that grow shallower near land, the sloshing of water between different ocean basins. As a result, the timing of the tides at most points on the Earth is a product of observations that are explained, incidentally, by theory.|$|E
500|$|The {{stronger}} northeast quadrant moved {{directly over}} Delaware for one tidal cycle, producing strong east-northeasterly wind gusts that peaked at [...] at a station along the Indian River. The highest tides and flooding along the Delaware coastline were between Bowers and Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge, where high waves built momentum from the Atlantic Ocean through the Delaware Bay. In Bowers, the tide reached [...] along the Murderkill River; the reading was only [...] {{less than the}} record set during the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962. The high tides flooded marsh vegetation in the town. In Lewes, the highest tide was , which was the second highest on record; only the 1962 storm was higher, which produced <b>a</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> [...] The storm caused significant flooding in Dewey Beach, where a high tide of [...] marked the second-highest tide in Delaware history. The saltwater contaminated the town's water supply. The ocean washed over dunes in several locations along Delaware Bay, including in Fowler Beach where flooding reached [...] inland. Near Mispillion Light, the high tides damaged the marina and several nearby buildings. The high tides flooded marshes and low-lying areas throughout the state, which briefly closed portions of state highways 54, 26, and 1. High tides destroyed 11blocks of the boardwalk in Rehoboth Beach {{and half of the}} promenade at Bethany Beach. At nearby South Bethany, high waves destroyed three houses. Along the coast, the storm destroyed 15houses and damaged 500others, amounting to over $5million (1992USD) in property damage. In addition to the strong winds and high tides, the nor'easter produced light rainfall that did not cause any flooding. The highest total in the state was [...] in Georgetown. Due to the damage, Kent and Sussex counties were declared federal disaster areas on February6; this allocated federal funding for repairing storm damage. Then-governor Michael Castle activated the state's National Guard to assist clearing highways and prevent civilian access to damaged areas. Due to storm damage, access to Dewey Beach and Rehoboth Beach were restricted to residents.|$|E
