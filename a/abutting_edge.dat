40|$|The {{scattering}} of a bending wave by {{a finite number}} of parallel rectilinear gaps in an infinite fluid-loaded plate is discussed. For the purpose of analysis, the widths of the gaps are assumed to be infinitesimal, but there is no physical contact between <b>abutting</b> <b>edges</b> of neighbouring sections of the plate. A section edge may be restrained by resilient supports or loadings, either individually or jointly with the neighbouring edge. The theory determines the attenuation of the bending wave by the gaps and the sound radiated into the ambient fluid during the interaction. Specific results are given for a steel plate which has a single gap in air and in water, such that either (1) the <b>abutting</b> <b>edges</b> are free to vibrate independently, (2) both edges are clamped, or (3) one edge is clamped and the other free. In each of these cases the coupling between the two halves of the plate is provided solely by the fluid loading: the bending wave would be totally reflected at the gap in vacuo. The results are relevant to the control and suppression of structure-borne sound. 1...|$|R

A suitable set of Wang dominoes can tile the plane, but only aperiodically. This is known because any Turing machine can be represented {{as a set of}} Wang dominoes that tile the plane if and only if the Turing machine does not halt. Since the halting problem is undecidable, the problem of deciding whether a Wang domino set can tile the plane is also undecidable.|$|R
40|$|Self-assembly, {{the process}} by which objects {{autonomously}} come together to form complex structures, is omnipresent in the physical world. Recent experiments in self-assembly demonstrate its potential for the parallel creation {{of a large number of}} nanostructures, including possibly computers. A systematic study of self-assembly as a mathematical process has been initiated by L. Adleman and E. Winfree. The individual components are modeled as square tiles on the infinite two-dimensional plane. Each side of a tile is covered by a specific “glue, ” and two adjacent tiles will stick iff they have matching glues on their <b>abutting</b> <b>edges.</b> Tiles that stick to each other may form various two-dimensional “structures ” such as squares and rectangles, or may cover the entire plane. In this paper we focus on a special type of structure, called a ribbon: a non-self-crossing rectilinear sequence of tiles on the plane, in which successive tiles are adjacent along an <b>edge</b> and <b>abutting</b> <b>edges</b> of consecutive tiles have matching glues. We prove that it is undecidable whether an arbitrary finite set of tiles with glues (infinite supply of each tile type available) can be used to assemble an infinite ribbon. While the problem can be proved undecidable using existing techniques if the ribbon is required to start with a given “seed ” tile, our result settles the “unseeded ” case, an open problem formerly known as the “unlimited infinite snake problem. ” The proof is based on a construction...|$|R
40|$|With the {{industrial}} use of FSW growing steadily, non-destructive testing methods that can detect the impending formation of flaws during welding must be developed.

The proof is based on a construction, due to Robinson, of a special set of tiles that allow only aperiodic tilings of the plane. This construction is used to create a special set of directed tiles (tiles with arrows painted on the top) with the “strong plane-filling property”- a variation of the “plane-filling property ” previously defined by J. Kari. A construction of “sandwich ” tiles is then used in conjunction with this special tile set, to reduce the well-known undecidable Tiling Problem to the problem of the existence of an infinite directed zipper (a special kind of ribbon). A “motif ” construction is then introduced that allows one tile system to simulate another by using geometry to represent glues. Using motifs, the infinite directed zipper problem is reduced to the infinite ribbon problem, proving the latter undecidable. The result settles an open problem formerly known as th...|$|R

40|$|In {{robotic vision}} using laser-radar measurements, noisy data on convex sets with corners are derived {{in terms of}} the set's support function. The corners {{represent}} <b>abutting</b> <b>edges</b> of manufactured items, and convey important information about the items' shape. However, simple methods for set estimation, for example based on fitting random polygons or smooth sets, either add additional corners as an artifact of the algorithm, or approximate corners by smooth curves. It might be argued, however, that corners have special significance in the interpretation of a set, and should not be introduced as an artifact of the estimation procedure. In this paper we suggest a corner-diagnostic approach, {{in the form of a}} three-step algorithm which (a) identifies the number and positions of corners, (b) fits smooth curves between corners, and (c) splices together the smooth curves and the corners, to produce an over-all estimate of the convex set. The corner-finding step is parametric in character, and although it is based on detecting change points in high-order derivatives of the support function, it produces root-n consistent estimators of the locations of corners. On the other hand, the smooth-curve fitting step is entirely nonparametric. The splicing step marries these two disparate approaches into a single, practical methodP. Hall and B. A. Turlac...|$|R

The space left below {{is greater than the}} length of the die, while the space above is less than the length of the die." [...] Corrected on the Royal Armouries replica, the configuration should allow for two full impressions of design 5, of equal length, joined vertically at their ends. Furthermore, the lack of fragments from the neck guard leaves open the question of how many vertical strips of design 5 were used. Although seven strips were suggested in the reconstruction, [...] "here is no evidence to indicate that there were seven vertical ornamental strips on the lower portion of the neck-guard, and the suggestion [...] [...] [...] that the number should be cut to five is equally possible." [...] Even if seven is the accurate number, the current reconstruction shows an [...] "implausible inward tilt" [...] by the two strips flanking the central one; straightening the strips [...] "would have the effect of allowing the ornamental strips to fan out naturally, leaving evenly-expanding wedges of plain surface between them." [...] Finally, the neck guard hangs lower on the current reconstruction than it would have when made, for the top of the neck guard originally fitted inside the cap.

40|$|Friction stir butt welding," {{as it was}} {{originally}} termed by Wayne Thomas and Christopher Dawes, in the early 1990 s, but now commonly called "friction stir welding," has made great progress as a new welding technique. Marshall Space Flight Center has been investigating the use of FSW for assembly of the Shuttle's external fuel tank since the late 1990 s and hopes to have the process in use {{by the summer of}} 2002. In FSW, a cylindrical pin tool of hardened steel, is rotated and plunged into the <b>abutting</b> <b>edges</b> of the parts to be joined. The tool is plunged into the weldment to within about. 050 in of the bottom to assure full penetration. As the tool moves along the joint, the tool shoulder helps produce frictional heating, causing the material to plasticize. The metal of the two abutting plates flows {{from the front of the}} tool to the back where it cools and coalesces to form a weld in the solid phase. One quarter inch thick plates of aluminum alloy 2219 were used in this study. Two samples, each consisting of two 4 in x 12 in plates, were friction stir welded. The anvil for one sample was coated with molybdenum sulfide, while for the other sample a sheet of roughened stainless steel was placed between the anvil and the sample. The retractable pin tool was used so that the depth of the pin tool penetration could be varied. As welding proceeded, the length of the pin tool was gradually increased from the starting point. The purpose of this investigation is to find out at what point, in the down ramp, penetration occurs. Differences in root structure of the friction stir weld due to differences in anvil friction will be observed. These observations will be analyzed using friction stir weld theory...|$|R

40|$|A {{solvent-based}} {{welding process}} enables the joining of precise, cast polyimide membranes at their edges to form larger precise membranes. The process creates a homogeneous, optical-quality seam between abutting membranes, with no overlap {{and with only}} a very localized area of figure disturbance. The seam retains 90 percent {{of the strength of}} the parent material. The process was developed for original use in the fabrication of wide-aperture membrane optics, with areal densities of less than 1 kg/m 2, for lightweight telescopes, solar concentrators, antennas, and the like to be deployed in outer space. The process is just as well applicable to the fabrication of large precise polyimide membranes for flat or inflatable solar concentrators and antenna reflectors for terrestrial applications. The process is applicable to cast membranes made of CP 1 (or equivalent) polyimide. The process begins with the precise fitting together and fixturing of two membrane segments. The seam is formed by applying a metered amount of a doped solution of the same polyimide along the <b>abutting</b> <b>edges</b> of the membrane segments. After the solution has been applied, the fixtured films are allowed to dry and are then cured by convective heating. The weld material {{is the same as the}} parent material, so that what is formed is a homogeneous, strong joint that is almost indistinguishable from the parent material. The success of the process is highly dependent on formulation of the seaming solution from the correct proportion of the polyimide in a suitable solvent. In addition, the formation of reliable seams depends on the deposition of a precise amount of the seaming solution along the seam line. To ensure the required precision, deposition is performed by use of an automated apparatus comprising a modified commercially available, large-format, ink-jet print head on an automated positioning table. The printing head jets the seaming solution into the seam area at a rate controlled in coordination with the movement of the positioning table...|$|R
