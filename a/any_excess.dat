5|$|Argasid ticks, unlike ixodid ticks, may {{go through}} {{up to seven}} nymphal stages (instars), {{requiring}} a meal of blood each time. Their life cycles range from months to years. The adult female argasid tick can lay a few hundred to over a thousand eggs {{over the course of}} her lifetime. Larvae feed very quickly and detach to molt into nymphs. Both male and female adults feed on blood, and they mate off the host. During feeding, <b>any</b> <b>excess</b> fluid is excreted by the coxal glands, a process which is unique to argasid ticks.|$|E

The pharynx opens into a cylindrical intestine, which is lined with glandular and digestive cells. The anus {{is located on the}} ventral surface close to the posterior of the body. In some species, there are pores in the pharynx opening to the ventral surface; these contain valves and may allow egestion of <b>any</b> <b>excess</b> water swallowed while feeding.|$|E

5|$|Until {{the late}} 1930s {{electricity}} was supplied by municipal undertakings. These were small power companies that built power stations {{dedicated to a}} single industry or group of factories, and sold <b>any</b> <b>excess</b> electricity to the public. These companies used widely differing standards of voltage and frequency. In 1925 Parliament decided that the power grid should be a single system with uniform standards and under public ownership. Several of the private power companies reacted to the proposal by forming the London Power Company. They planned to heed parliament's recommendations and build {{a small number of}} very large stations.|$|E
5|$|There were {{assertions that}} Odex had charged 10% {{interest}} for settlements paid through an instalment plan, but {{a press release}} by the company denied that it had required any such interest payments. By September 2007, 105 out of the 300 SingNet subscribers who had received letters had negotiated with and paid Odex, although, in a news conference, Odex said that it had neither forced payment from nor fined anyone. The company explained {{that it would not}} profit from the enforcement process and intended to donate to charity <b>any</b> <b>excess</b> amount received. It would also release a financial audit of all the money collected at the close of proceedings. On 31 August 2007, in an attempt to address criticisms of late releases, Odex began to offer video on demand (VOD) on its relaunched website. Users could legally download and unlock a digital rights management (DRM)-protected anime episode at S$2 for seven days.|$|E
5|$|Uncovered {{interest}} rate parity asserts that an investor with dollar deposits will earn the {{interest rate}} available on dollar deposits, while an investor holding euro deposits will earn {{the interest rate}} available in the eurozone, but also a potential gain or loss on euros depending on the rate of appreciation or depreciation of the euro against the dollar. Economists have extrapolated a useful approximation of uncovered interest rate parity that follows intuitively from these assumptions. If uncovered interest rate parity holds, such that an investor is indifferent between dollar versus euro deposits, then <b>any</b> <b>excess</b> return on euro deposits must be offset by some expected loss from depreciation of the euro against the dollar. Conversely, some shortfall in return on euro deposits must be offset by some expected gain from appreciation of the euro against the dollar. The following equation represents the uncovered interest rate parity approximation.|$|E

2500|$|Since vitamin A is fat-soluble, {{disposing}} of <b>any</b> <b>excesses</b> taken in through diet takes {{much longer than}} with water-soluble B vitamins and vitamin C. [...] This allows for toxic levels of vitamin A to accumulate. These toxicities only occur with preformed (retinoid) vitamin A (such as from liver). The carotenoid forms (such as beta-carotene as found in carrots), give no such symptoms, but excessive dietary intake of beta-carotene can lead to carotenodermia, a harmless but cosmetically displeasing orange-yellow discoloration of the skin.|$|R

The measured temperature of the debris is 110K, which places it in an orbit between 4 and 6 AU from the star, or about the same distance where Jupiter orbits the Sun. This debris disk may have been created by the breakup of a single, 100km diameter planetesimal through a collision. The star system does not show <b>any</b> <b>excess</b> emission at 70 μm, indicating it does not have a cold outer dust disk.|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} part of the work of Bishop Joseph Butler is focused on the analysis of human nature whose knowledge is of utmost importance for morality. The nature of man, says Butler, is a system or constitution formed, in part, by a set of appetites, passions and affections, and in part by a principle of reflection or conscience with their relationship marked by mutual respect and by the natural superiority of consciousness. Passions, but subject to the rational order, are necessary, are as essential as the proper order. Although man cannot ever reach perfection, when the principle of reflection directs, correcting <b>any</b> <b>excesses</b> of passion, man is virtuous.

60|$|Lee {{was opposed}} to an attack of any kind. He would make a bridge of gold for the enemy. They were nearly equal in number to the Americans, and far {{superior}} in discipline. An attack would endanger {{the safety of the}} cause. He advised merely to follow the enemy, observe their motions, and prevent them from committing <b>any</b> <b>excesses.</b> Lee's opinions had still great weight with the army; most of the officers, both foreign and American, concurred with him. Greene, Lafayette, Wayne, and Cadwalader, thought differently. They could not brook that the enemy should evacuate the city, and make a long march through the country unmolested. Washington seeing such want of unanimity among his generals, requested their opinions in writing. Before these were given in, word was brought that the enemy had actually evacuated the city.|$|R

25|$|Equalising of {{the mask}} is an {{essential}} skill for any form of diving. Goggles that do not cover the nose can not be equalised and are unsuitable for diving.

Equalising (or clearing) the ears is necessary to prevent barotrauma to the middle and inner ear.

25|$|In humans, {{there is}} no {{evidence}} for riboflavin toxicity produced by excessive intakes, in part because it has lower water solubility than other B vitamins, because absorption becomes less efficient as doses increase, and because what excess is absorbed is excreted via the kidneys into urine. Even when 400mg of riboflavin per day was given orally to subjects in one study for three months to investigate the efficacy of riboflavin in the prevention of migraine headache, no short-term side effects were reported. Although toxic doses can be administered by injection, <b>any</b> <b>excess</b> at nutritionally relevant doses is excreted in the urine, imparting a bright yellow color when in large quantities.|$|E
