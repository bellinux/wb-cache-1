40|$|This paper {{studied the}} effects of {{anti-dumping}} measures on the imports to investigate whether the trade restriction effect of an <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty</b> is dominant. Our results indicate that a 1 % increase in the anti-dumping duties decreases the import of the targeted product by about 0. 43 ~ 0. 51 %. The actual statistics, however, show that the total import of the targeted products increased by about 30 percent while an <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty</b> was in force. That indicates that an <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty</b> is just a temporary import relief. This paper also investigated whether an <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty</b> is terminated in {{the case that the}} injury would not be likely to continue or recur if the duty were removed. The hazards model estimates show that increase in market share, MFN tariff rate, and dumping margin decrease the hazard of termination of an <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty,</b> but the increase in value added increases the hazard of termination. Generally speaking, this result indicates that the WTO member countries have regulated the overuse of an anti-dumping measure.

40|$|<b>Anti-dumping</b> <b>duties,</b> {{safeguards}} and countervailing duties are collectively, {{within the}} context of the WTO, referred to as „trade remedies. ‟ More specifically, the imposition of <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duties</b> is a remedial measure for dealing with imports that cause or threatens to cause injury to local producers. Under the WTO framework, Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 and the Agreement on the Implementation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 provides the rules for applying <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duties</b> by member countries. Nigeria has been a member of the WTO since 1995 and can only apply <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duties</b> provided it adheres to the rules governing anti-dumping. The purpose of this study is to ascertain whether the proposed Anti-dumping and Countervailing Bill, 2010 is consistent with WTO jurisprudence on anti-dumping. This study also highlights landmark developments in South Africa‟s anti-dumping system with a view to providing direction to Nigeria in order for its proposed national legislation on anti-dumping to be WTO compliant.

40|$|On the 26 th of November 2013 the European Commission {{concluded}} that solar glass origi- nating from the People’s Republic of China had been {{dumped into the}} European market. The Commission imposed a provisional <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty</b> on subsequent imports. This thesis eval- uates the expected and actual welfare implications for consumers in the German market after the <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty</b> was introduced. As Europe’s largest solar energy producer, German data on solar energy production, sampled between 2011 and 2014, as well as price levels and installation rates for solar energy provides a robust framework of analysis. By way of a mul- tiple regression analysis, {{it is found that}} the introduction of the Commission’s <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty</b> had a statistically insignificant effect on the production of solar electricity in the German market. Through the continued growth in solar energy production, it is found that German consumers are inelastic to changes in the price of solar energy. Prior literature underlines the prevalence of consumption preferences for consumers who exhibit the ’warm-glow’ effect and derive utility out of altruism towards the environment. The heightened consumption of solar energy in spite of rising prices underlines this effect. These conclusions enable further consider- ation for the duty’s implications for market welfare in the country, and also its implications for the wider European community. It is concluded, in contrast with classical theory on industrial organisation, that European consumers were made no worse off {{as a result of the}} <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty,</b> and that producers benefited...|$|E

40|$|The Agreement on the Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (1994) (Anti-Dumping Agreement) {{permits the}} {{imposition}} of anti-dumping duties for as long {{and to the extent}} necessary to counteract dumping which is causing injury, subject to the proviso that they must be terminated after five years unless a sunset review has been initiated. A sunset review has the purpose of either permitting or terminating the continuation of an <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty.</b> This is significant because if the sunset review is not initiated prior to the expiry of the five-year period, the anti-dumping duties will be terminated. Therefore, this places an emphasis on the determination of the precise date of commencement of the anti-dumping duties. This is because an incorrect determination of the date of {{the imposition of}} the <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty</b> has obvious financial implications for the interested parties. The Supreme Court of Appeal in South Africa has delivered two salient judgments in this regard: firstly, in Progress Office Machines CC v SARS 2008 2 SA 13 (SCA) (POM), and then more recently, in Association of Meat Importers v ITAC 2013 4 All SA 253 (SCA) (AMIE). This paper contends that these two judgments are in conflict and are riddled with inconsistencies. Secondly, the paper contends that the SCA has in the recent AMIE case virtually rewritten its earlier judgment of Progress Office Machines. Lastly, the paper shows that the approach of South African courts to whether the Anti-Dumping Agreement is binding on South African law is fraught with uncertainty and ambivalence. The case analysis also reflects on the impact of the newly minted but yet to be implemented Customs Duty Act with a view to assessing the impact of the new legislation on the issues currently plaguing the anti-dumping regime of South Africa...|$|E
