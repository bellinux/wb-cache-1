25|$|Starting on January 1, 1935, Eddie leased the Jersey City Airport <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> flying {{school from}} {{there until the}} field was {{converted}} into a sports stadium using WPA money. Eddie was taking off in a Travel Air three-seat, open-cockpit biplane with his student, Fred Weigel (1904–1990), when the motor died. From an altitude of 100feet they crashed into Newark Bay, but were unhurt {{and were able to}} walk ashore. He also taught Herbert Sargent to fly with just 55 minutes in lessons.|$|E
25|$|On February 23, 1883, William Kinsman {{had been}} living with May Woodman. Apparently as a joke, someone had run a notice in the Epitaph {{newspaper}} that Kinsman intended to marry Woodman. Kinsman responded <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> own announcement {{that he had no}} intentions of marrying May Woodman. Kinsman {{was standing in front of}} the Oriental Saloon on Allen Street when May Woodman walked up and shot him. Woodman was sentenced to five years in the Yuma Territorial Prison for killing Kinsman, although the acting governor pardoned her after she had served less than one year.|$|E

25|$|However, Clark {{remained}} belligerent in his {{attacks on}} the Trudeau government, angrily clashing with the prime minister in Parliament. He hired experienced staffers such as Lowell Murray, Duncan Edmonds, and William Neville, who shaped his policies <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> office efficiently. He improved his party's standing in national opinion polls. Clark worked very hard, and gradually earned the respect of most people, including his own caucus, by presenting a series of well thought out speeches and questions in Parliament. He benefited when live television came to the House of Commons in 1977, allowing viewers {{to see that he}} was evolving into a real rival for Trudeau.|$|E
25|$|While {{maintaining}} {{his university}} position, Sim also taught private pupils and later founded <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> own drama school {{for children in}} Edinburgh. This developed his skills as a director and occasional actor. One of his pupils, Naomi Merlith Plaskitt, aged twelve when they met, became his wife six years later. The dramatist John Drinkwater saw one of Sim's productions for the school and encouraged {{him to become a}} professional actor. Through Drinkwater's influence, Sim was cast in his first professional production, Othello at the Savoy Theatre, London, in 1930; he understudied the three principal male roles (played by Paul Robeson, Maurice Browne and Ralph Richardson) and played the small role of the messenger.|$|E
25|$|One {{reason for}} the team's struggles was disarray in the front office. Marshall began a mental decline in 1962, and the team's other {{stockholders}} {{found it difficult to}} make decisions without their boss. Marshall died on August 9, 1969, and Edward Bennett Williams, a minority stockholder who was a Washington resident and one of America's most esteemed attorneys, was chosen to run the franchise while the majority stockholder, Jack Kent Cooke, lived in Los Angeles <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> basketball team, the Los Angeles Lakers. In 1966 Otto Graham was hired as the new head coach. Graham coached the Redskins between 1966 and 1968, but whatever magic he had as an NFL player disappeared on the sidelines as the team recorded a mark of 17–22–3 during that time period. After resigning the Redskins' post in favor of Vince Lombardi, Graham returned as athletic director of the Coast Guard Academy before retiring at the end of 1984.|$|E

He returned to the State Bank, but continued to play first-class cricket, playing another nine matches for South Australia in the Sheffield Shield between March 1946 and December 1947. He also played in the local Adelaide competition until 1955, playing for West Torrens. Meanwhile, he stopped working for the bank <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> family's market garden business. In 1959 and 1968, he unsuccessfully stood for election in the state electoral district of West Torrens. He also contested the federal seat of Hindmarsh in 1966 as a Liberal candidate, but was also unsuccessful.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{his many}} philanthropic efforts, the {{establishment}} of public libraries throughout the United States, Britain, Canada and other English-speaking countries was especially prominent. In this special driving interest and project of his he {{was inspired by a}} visit and tour he made with Enoch Pratt (1808–1896), formerly of Massachusetts but who made his fortune in Baltimore <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> various mercantile and financial businesses very thriftily. Pratt in turn had been inspired and helped by his friend and fellow Bay Stater, George Peabody, (1795–1869) who also had made his fortune in the [...] "Monumental City" [...] of Baltimore before moving to New York and London to expand his empire as the richest man in America before the Civil War. Later he too endowed several institutions, schools, libraries and foundations in his home commonwealth, and also in Baltimore with his Peabody Institute in 1857, completed in 1866, with added library wings a decade later and several educational foundations throughout the Old South. Several decades later, Carnegie's visit with Mr. Pratt lasted for several days; resting and dining in his city mansion, then touring, visiting and talking with staff and ordinary citizen patrons of the newly established Enoch Pratt Free Library (1886) impressed the Scotsman deeply – years later he was always heard to proclaim that [...] "Pratt was my guide and inspiration".|$|E

2500|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, Pearl used {{advertisement}} campaigns that featured Judge Roy Bean - {{one of the}} more colorful and popular law enforcement personalities of the wild, wild West. [...] In Langtry, Texas, Judge [...] Bean declared himself the [...] "Law West of the Pecos" [...] <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> court in the town's tiny U.S. Post Office and bar called the Jersey Lilly Saloon. [...] Judge Roy Bean was as famous in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as many of the motion picture stars are today. [...] Judge Bean's favorite (and rumored only) beer in his saloon was Pearl. [...] Seeing this as an opportunity, San Antonio Brewing Association for decades used the connection to Judge Bean and the Jersey Lilly as advertising focal points. [...] Later, in the 1950s, the brewery's old horse stables were converted into a hospitality room and given a Roy Bean feel to them in honor of Judge Roy Bean and his saloon. [...] The old stables were renovated again in the 1970s with the main hall renamed the Lily Langtry Room and the whole building named the Jersey Lilly. [...] In addition, an exact replica of Bean's saloon was built and placed on the brewery grounds for use in Pearl's [...] "Wild West Shows" [...] and as a gift shop. [...] The ties to Bean's larger-than-life legacy lasted almost a century, and remained predominantly visible in the brewery until its closing in 2001.|$|E
