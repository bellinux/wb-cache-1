[...] He informs us of real issues we otherwise wouldn't hear or think deeply about, which in and of itself is brilliant, but what really sets him apart is his way of calling his audience to action <b>about</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues.</b> He shows us that there really is something we can do and helps us to see how we can enact change.|$|E
500|$|On {{ceremonial}} occasions Dudley often {{acted as}} an unofficial consort, {{sometimes in the}} Queen's stead. In a personal letter to the Earl of Shrewsbury, {{an old friend of}} Leicester's, Elizabeth said she considered Leicester as [...] "another ourself". He largely assumed charge of court ceremonial and organised hundreds of small and large festivities. From 1587 he was Lord Steward, being responsible for the royal household's supply with food and other commodities. He displayed a strong sense for economising and reform in this function, which he had de facto occupied long before his official appointment. The sanitary situation in the palaces was a perennial problem, and a talk with Leicester <b>about</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> inspired John Harington to construct a water closet. Leicester was a lifelong sportsman, hunting and jousting in the tiltyard, and an indefatigable tennis-player. He was also the Queen's regular dancing partner.|$|E

[...] Karen Clark, a payroll clerk for a timber company in Stayton, Oregon, said: [...] "The Simpsons portrayed us as greedy, bribery-type people. It didn't portray us as the everyday people—mothers, fathers, good members of society—that we are."

They also drew attention to some of Singapore's other laws, including the [...] "mandatory flushing of public toilets" [...] rule. Confused reporting <b>about</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> has led to worldwide propagation of the myth that the use or importation of chewing gum is itself punishable with caning. In fact, this has never been a caning offence, and the only penalties provided under Chapter 57 are fines and imprisonment.|$|E

2500|$|Luttwak's {{work has}} been praised for its lucid {{analysis}} of, and insights into, issues regarding Roman military dispositions, and for stimulating much scholarly debate <b>about</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues.</b> But the validity of his basic thesis has been strongly disputed {{by a number of}} scholars, especially in a powerful critique by B. Isaac, the author of the fundamental study of the Roman army in the East (1992). The objections fall under two broad headings: (1) The Roman empire did not have the intelligence and planning capacity to sustain a [...] "grand strategy" [...] and in any case was not defensive in ideology or policy.(2) Defence-in-depth is not, in the main, consistent with the literary and archaeological evidence.|$|E

[...] She {{has said that the}} U.S. decision to deny a visa to Modi over allegations of his involvement in the 2002 Gujarat riots was a [...] "great blunder", {{on the grounds that it}} could have undermined the US-India relationship had he used it as an excuse to reject a strong relationship with America. She also criticized the arrest of Indian consular officer Devyani Khobragade on charges of visa fraud and perjury. [...] In 2013, she joined some of her colleagues on the House Foreign Affairs Committee in opposing a resolution in the House of Representatives that called for [...] "religious freedom and related human rights to be included in the United States-India Strategic Dialogue and for such issues to be raised directly with federal and state Indian government officials", saying it would weaken the friendship between India and US, citing the timing of the bill as interfering in India's elections, while emphasizing the need for US to stand for religious freedom.|$|E

[...] Jackson also disclosed previously unreported details about his financial history and past drug use, saying he wanted to [...] "reveal as many of my weaknesses and shortcomings as a curious press and my opposition might want to look into," [...] and by doing so, [...] "maybe save you and your colleagues some further research." [...] In regards to claims that he thinks birth defects are caused by parents' sins, Jackson said, [...] "I do not believe that birth defects are caused by parents' sin unless, of course, there's a direct scientific connection between the parents' behavior and the disabilities of the child," [...] such as a child who might develop birth defects if his or her mother was addicted to heroin. He also denied that he had said yoga leads to Satanism: [...] "I do not believe that yoga leads to Satanism. One of my ministers is a yoga instructor.

2500|$|The trouble though is, {{that this}} productive/unproductive {{distinction}} {{is not easily}} made in practice, given changes in the market, in social-organizational efficiency, and in production techniques, {{and it does not}} necessarily {{have anything to do with}} whether a worker produces something tangible or not. What looks like an efficiency gain from [...] "weeding out" [...] seemingly unproductive activity may in fact not be an efficiency gain in total, or it may be very difficult to prove that it is. If fewer workers are made to do more work, intensifying labor, then accidents, illness or errors may increase. In the real world, technical efficiency and financial efficiency are not necessarily the same thing at all. Hence there is continual debate in management theory <b>about</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues,</b> with few [...] "general" [...] answers being available, since much depends on the specific organizational technique of enterprises. The only [...] "general" [...] answer there is, is to recast the accounting for every detailed activity that workers perform as a statistically observable input-output relationship which results in a [...] "product", even if the [...] "product" [...] is no real product at all, but some kind of service or performance result. By describing a labor-service or a task performance as a product, it seems identifiably productive, although substantively it may not create any new product. In Marxist theory, this is called the [...] "commodification of services": each specific service is accounted for as a specific alienable product with a certain price tag, and managed accordingly. Eventually, many services which have to be performed by trained staff are replaced by mass-produced things, because that is more profitable and cheaper to buy. For example, a teacher is replaced with an instruction video.|$|E
