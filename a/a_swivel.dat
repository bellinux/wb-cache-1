5|$|The present {{bridge of}} seven arches was erected by the Commissioners for the Improvement of Navigation of the Shannon in 1841–1843. The {{engineer}} was Thomas Rhodes, {{one of the}} commissioners of the Shannon Navigation, whose name {{can be seen on}} many of the bridges over the Shannon and on surviving lock mechanisms, notably at Victoria and Athlone locks. This bridge was reconstructed and widened jointly by Offaly County Council and Galway County Council in 1971. Their work included replacing massive stone parapets {{on either side of the}} bridge with aluminium railings, and the removal of <b>a</b> <b>swivel</b> arch which had allowed passage for masted boats.|$|E
25|$|USB {{connector}} cover or cap – {{reduces the risk}} of damage, prevents the entry of dirt or other contaminants, and improves overall device appearance. Some flash drives use retractable USB connectors instead. Others have <b>a</b> <b>swivel</b> arrangement so that the connector can be protected without removing anything.|$|E
25|$|On 5 May Elk {{captured}} a Spanish privateer rowboat armed with <b>a</b> <b>swivel</b> gun and small arms. The privateer was five {{days out of}} Santiago and had taken two doggers. Elk {{caught up with the}} privateer off Cape Cruz, Cuba, captured her and retook one of the doggers. The privateer was the Cubana, with a 14 man crew, only five of whom were still aboard.|$|E

25|$|The harquebusier {{would usually}} have been {{armed with a}} doglock carbine, hung from <b>a</b> <b>swivel</b> {{attached}} to a baldric, pistols, either wheellock or flintlock, in saddle holsters and a stout, straight-bladed, sword. The 'dog' of the doglock was a type of safety-catch, very useful to prevent the unintentional firing of the carbine when on horseback. Records also indicate that some harquebusiers were also armed with a horseman's poleaxe or pick, these were hafted weapons with axe or hammer heads and armour-piercing spikes.|$|E
25|$|A breech-loading swivel gun was a {{particular}} type of swivel gun and a small breech-loading cannon invented in the 14th century. It was equipped with <b>a</b> <b>swivel</b> for easy rotation and was loaded by inserting a mug-shaped device called a chamber, filled with gunpowder and projectiles. It had a high rate of fire, as several chambers could be prepared in advance and quickly fired in succession and was especially effective in anti-personnel roles. It was used for centuries by many countries of Europe, Asia and Africa.|$|E
25|$|World Business Class was the {{equivalent}} of business class on Northwest Airlines' international flights. It was available on Airbus A330, Boeing 747–400, and trans-Atlantic Boeing 757–200 aircraft. On Airbus A330 and Boeing 747–400 aircraft, seats had 60inches of pitch and 176 degrees of recline. On trans-Atlantic Boeing 757–200 aircraft, seats had 60inches of pitch and 178 degrees of recline. Passengers aboard this class received free meals and refreshments, including alcoholic beverages. All seats were equipped with Audio-Video-On-Demand (AVOD), universal power-ports, a moveable reading light, a folding work table, and <b>a</b> <b>swivel</b> cocktail table.|$|E
50|$|The medal {{was struck}} in silver {{and is a}} disk, 36 millimetres in diameter, with <b>a</b> <b>swivelling</b> suspender. Designed by William Wyon and L.C. Wyon, the dies for the medal were {{engraved}} by Leonard Charles Wyon.|$|R

25|$|From 29 April 1802 until 1809 Peterel {{was under}} Commander John Lamborn. In May 1804, she sailed for Jamaica and Barbados, convoying the West Indies trade, and {{thereafter}} {{remained in the}} West Indies for some years. She destroyed a small privateer on the Jamaica station on 23 January 1805. The privateer was a felucca, armed with one 4-pounder gun and <b>a</b> <b>swivel</b> gun. She had a crew of 27 men, all except one of whom escaped after they ran her on shore and before Peterels boats arrived to burn her. The privateer had captured an American brig which she had sent into Havana where the brig was sold.|$|E
25|$|In January 2012, <b>a</b> <b>swivel</b> gun {{found two}} years before at Dundee Beach near Darwin was widely {{reported}} by web news sources and the Australian press to be of Portuguese origin. However, initial analysis by the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory indicated it is probably also of South East Asian origin. The museum holds seven guns of South East Asian manufacture in its collections. Another swivel gun of South East Asian manufacture, found in Darwin in 1908, is held by the Museum of South Australia. Further analysis in 2014 suggested lead in the Dundee beach gun most closely resembled lead from Andalusia, a region of Spain. However, sand inside the gun was dated to 1750.|$|E
25|$|On 17 May boats from Apollo and Cerberus took {{a vessel}} that ran aground near Brindisi. She was {{armed with a}} 9-pounder gun in the bow and <b>a</b> <b>swivel</b> gun. She was sailing from Otranto to Ancona. The next day the boats also brought off a gun from a Martello tower a little further to the south. Then ten days later the boats {{captured}} three gunboats at Fano that were protecting a convoy. The gun-boats each mounted a 9-pounder in their bows and two 4-pounders abaft. They were {{under the command of}} an Ufficiale di Vascello, carrying troops for Corfu. The British also captured four vessels from the convoy. British losses amounted to two men killed and one wounded.|$|E
50|$|The G 4/5 was a four coupled tender {{locomotive}} with {{a leading}} axle in <b>a</b> <b>swivelling</b> pony truck. Whereas {{the first six}} examples were delivered as saturated steam compound locomotives, all of the remaining examples came into service as superheated machines with single stage steam expansion.|$|R
50|$|The {{steam pipes}} were routed {{across the front}} tube-plates into {{fittings}} which formed a prolongation of the bottom part of the smokeboxes. From there, steam passed through <b>a</b> <b>swivelling</b> and sliding joint to the cylinders. The exhaust pipes back to the smokeboxes were equipped with ball and socket joints.|$|R
50|$|H. Adams, of Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England, {{offered a}} {{conversion}} set that converted horse-drawn carriages into motorized automobiles. The engine was mounted on <b>a</b> <b>swivelling</b> fore-carriage, and steering was achieved through wheel and vertical column. In 1905, Adams produced a small 2-cylinder car sold {{under the name}} 'One of the Best'.|$|R
25|$|After the 210 convicts {{were all}} disembarked a fire was {{discovered}} {{on the ship}} at 4.30 pm on 20 May 1814. It was later thought that the fire was caused by candle snuff being dropped on oakum when an officer and boy had entered the hold. It soon {{became apparent that the}} fire could not be fought and so Three Bees was cut loose from her moorings and the other ships in the cove maneuvered to avoid the ship. At 5.30 pm the first gun exploded on board and <b>a</b> <b>swivel</b> ball smashed into the parlour of the house of Captain Piper, hitting only a writing table. The ship drifted onto Bennelong Point and shortly after her magazine exploded. Three Bees was a total loss.|$|E
25|$|The two musical {{panels are}} {{commonly}} known by variants of the titles Singing Angels and Music-making Angels, and are both 161cm x 69.3cm. Each features a choir; {{on the left}} angels gather behind a wooden carved music stand positioned on <b>a</b> <b>swivel,</b> to the right a group with stringed instruments gather around a pipe organ, played by a seated angel, shown full-length. The presence {{of the two groups}} {{on either side of the}} Deësis reflects a by then well-established motif in representations of the heavens opening; that of musical accompaniment provided by celestial beings. As was common in the Low Countries in the 15th century, the angels are dressed in liturgical robes, a custom that migrated from Latin liturgical drama to the art of the period.|$|E

5000|$|In 1947 Earle MacPherson {{patented}} the MacPherson strut {{for use on}} the Chevrolet Cadet. [...] This was {{the first}} true strut suspension for cars: the stub axle was rigidly fixed to the strut, thus always keeping the same angle with it, rather than being attached through <b>a</b> <b>swivelling</b> joint as for Stout's Scarab.|$|R
40|$|For the test, the 12 -inch-diameter "Vortex-Ring" {{parachute}} was towed {{behind a}} conical-nosed cylindrical body 2. 25 inches in diameter. The tow-cable length was 24 inches, and {{was attached to}} the cylindrical body through <b>a</b> large <b>swivel</b> and to the parachute through <b>a</b> smaller <b>swivel.</b> The attachment between the large <b>swivel</b> <b>an</b> the cylindrical body failed after about 1 minute's operation. Mach number was approximately 2. 2, dynamic pressure was approximately 150 pounds per square foot, and camera speed was approximately 3000 frames per second...|$|R
25|$|Planer {{boards are}} trolled devices {{designed}} to spread fishing lures out {{away from the}} fishing vessel. They allow multiple lines to be trolled. They come in dual board and inline board designs. Dual board designs consist of two boards that are spaced apart and attached by a line to a mast {{near the front of}} the boat with a separate fishing line in a spring tension release clip that separates when the fishing line is set. Inline boards are attached directly to the fishing line and a spring tension clip that releases upon setting or tripping the planer board so it slides down the fishing line to <b>a</b> <b>swivel</b> tied several feet in front of the lure. Inlines are popular with walleye fishermen. Once tripped they offer much less resistance when reeling in a fish.|$|E
500|$|Six [...] torpedo tubes {{were also}} fitted, {{with a total}} of 16 torpedoes. One tube was fitted to <b>a</b> <b>swivel</b> mount on the stern of the ship, four were {{submerged}} on the broadside, and the sixth was placed in the bow, also submerged.|$|E
500|$|The cruiser carried ten [...] SK L/30 quick-firing {{guns for}} defense against torpedo boats. Each of these guns was {{supplied}} with 250shells.

The ship's gun armament was rounded out by four autocannons, though these were subsequently removed. The ship was also fitted with four [...] torpedo tubes. One was mounted on the stern in <b>a</b> <b>swivel</b> mount, one was mounted submerged in the bow, and one was placed submerged in the hull on either side abreast of the forward gun turret.|$|E
5000|$|Bevan {{based his}} passing game on his {{swiftness}} to retrieve ball hooked at high velocity and on <b>a</b> <b>swivelling</b> dive-pass that foiled marauders and spoilers.

500|$|Baxter {{was noted}} for {{accurate}} passes, for sending opponents {{the wrong way}} with <b>a</b> <b>swivel</b> of his hips, and for inspiring teammates with his confident approach. He attracted attention by his stylish play, controlling the game with [...] "unhurried artistry". He refused to conform with the [...] "efficient" [...] style that dominated British football or the energetic, physical style that was typical of Rangers at the time. Indeed, although Rangers insisted that players tuck their shirts completely into their shorts, Baxter always let part of his dangle over his left hip. He described his approach to playing football as [...] "treating the ball like a woman. Give it a cuddle, caress it a wee bit, take your time, and you'll get the required response".|$|E
500|$|The Sachsen-class {{ships were}} armed with six [...] L/22 guns mounted in two armored barbettes, one forward and one {{amidships}}. Two guns {{were placed in}} the forward barbette and four were mounted in the amidships position. These guns were supplied with 480rounds of ammunition. They could depress to −7° and elevate to 16.5°; this enabled a maximum range of [...] The ships were also equipped with six [...] L/24 guns and eight [...] Hotchkiss revolver cannons. After 1886, three [...] torpedo tubes were installed on each ship; one tube was placed in <b>a</b> <b>swivel</b> mount in the stern and two {{were placed in the}} bow, submerged. The tubes were supplied with a total of 12 torpedoes. Later, a pair of [...] torpedo tubes were mounted in the ships' hulls above water on the broadside.|$|E
500|$|The iLoo was {{designed}} to be a Wi-Fi Internet-enabled portable toilet that would allow users to surf the internet while using the loo. Internally, the facility would have a broadband connection via wireless 802.11b, a wireless waterproof keyboard, <b>a</b> <b>swivel</b> plasma screen running Windows XP Professional, a 6-channel surround-sound system beneath the sink, toilet paper embossed with popular URLs, and a suction toilet. Externally, the facility would feature an MSN logo and have a [...] "Hotmail station" [...] with an additional plasma screen and keyboard for waiting consumers. A security guard was to be stationed near the unit to ensure that it was being properly used and to prevent the unit from being stolen. The iLoo was to debut [...] "at a majority of the summer season festivals". The iLoo was to be deployed only in Britain.|$|E
