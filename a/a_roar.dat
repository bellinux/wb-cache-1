5|$|In {{the mating}} season, rutting males bellow {{to make their}} {{presence}} known to females. Muskoxen roar during male-male fights, and male saigas force air through their noses, producing <b>a</b> <b>roar</b> to deter rival males and attract females. Mothers also use vocal communication to locate their calves if they get separated. During fights over dominance, males tend to display themselves in an erect posture with a level muzzle.|$|E
5|$|Having {{heard all}} of that, the brother took two pistols, poured more gunpowder, and {{sharpened}} the flints; {{he put the}} pistols into his belt, placed the knife between them, and slung a musket over his shoulder. He set forth. He passed through the dark forest; he came beneath the stair-like cliff; {{the moon and the}} stars were shining, so it was like a day; a silence all around him, pleasant; he sat down and lit his pipe. Before long a wisp of cloud showed from the direction of Mount Rumija; there came <b>a</b> <b>roar</b> and bluster, and everything happened as the sick man said. His hair rose so that three times he jammed his cap down on his head. Finally, three bulls fell down from the storm cloud and started to fight; all as it was said. He stabbed the pied bull in the neck with the knife; it staggered and fell; the light-haired bull got encouraged. Then he stabbed the dark-haired bull, and it slumped; the light-haired was finishing them off with its horns. This was not enough for him, and, fearing that the cut bulls could still rise up, he kept on striking them with the knife as long as there was a breath in their bodies. The storm cloud suddenly disappeared; together with it, the light-haired bull vanished. Again the moon and the stars shone; again a silence and blessedness. He was going back home as if flying; when he arrived he found his brother sitting by the hearth, placing logs on the fire, healthy as if he had never been sick.|$|E

[...] "So terrible and so incessant <b>a</b> <b>roar</b> of guns few {{even in the}} army and navy had ever heard before," [...] wrote Ambrose Serle, private secretary to Lord Howe. Nearly eighty guns fired at the shore for a full hour. The Americans were half buried under dirt and sand, and were unable to return fire due to the smoke and dust. After the guns ceased, the British flatboats appeared out of the smoke and headed for shore. By then the Americans were in a panicked retreat, and the British began their amphibious landing.|$|E
500|$|In 1952, Nurmi {{was persuaded}} by Urho Kekkonen, Prime Minister of Finland and former {{chairman}} of the Finnish Athletics Federation, to carry the Olympic torch into the Olympic Stadium at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. His appearance astonished the spectators, and Sports Illustrated wrote that [...] "his celebrated stride was unmistakable to the crowd. When he came into view, waves of sound began to build throughout the stadium, rising to <b>a</b> <b>roar,</b> then to a thunder. When the national teams, assembled in formation on the infield, saw the flowing figure of Nurmi, they broke ranks like excited schoolchildren, dashing {{toward the edge of the}} track." [...] After lighting the flame in the Olympic Cauldron, Nurmi passed the torch to his idol Kolehmainen, who lighted the beacon in the tower.

500|$|After a poor 1958 preseason by Tittle, Albert started John Brodie {{at quarterback}} for the 1958 season, a {{decision}} that proved unpopular with the fan base. Tittle came in to relieve Brodie in a week six game against the Lions, with ten {{minutes left in the}} game and the 49ers down 21–17. His appearance [...] "drew <b>a</b> <b>roar</b> of approval from the crowd of 59,213," [...] after which he drove the team downfield and threw a 32-yard touchdown pass to McElhenny for the winning score. A right knee ligament injury against the Colts in week nine ended Tittle's season, and San Francisco finished with a 7–5 record, followed by Albert's resignation as coach. Tittle and Brodie continued to share time at quarterback over the next two seasons. In his fourth and final Pro Bowl game with the 49ers in 1959, Tittle completed 13 of 17 passes for 178 yards and a touchdown.|$|E

500|$|When {{the film}} reels {{were taken to}} Madras, {{thousands}} of people gathered at the city's central railway station and followed the reel box along Wall Tax Road to Kinema Central, throwing rose petals, breaking open coconuts, and burning incense.

Theodore Baskaran as Korathi Dance and Songs), was screened alongside Kalidas as a side attraction. It starred Rajalakshmi, and the gypsy dancer Jhansi Bai. In a 2015 interview with The Times of India, Rajalakshmi's daughter Kamala stated that during the film's release, [...] "people in Madras used to stand outside theatres for {{a distance of about}} 4-5km to witness [...] acting in her first pesum padam.

500|$|Facial {{expressions}} {{include the}} [...] "defense threat", where an individual bares its teeth, flattens its ears and its pupils enlarge. Both {{males and females}} show a flehmen response, a characteristic grimace, when sniffing urine markings but flehmen is more often associated with males detecting the markings made by tigresses in oestrus. Like other Panthera, tigers roar, particularly in aggressive situations, during the mating season or when making a kill. There are two different roars: the [...] "true" [...] roar is made using the hyoid apparatus and forced through an open mouth as it progressively closes, and the shorter, harsher [...] "coughing" [...] roar is made with the mouth open and teeth exposed. The [...] "true" [...] roar can be heard at up to [...] away and is sometimes emitted {{three or four times}} in succession. When tense, tigers will moan, a sound similar to <b>a</b> <b>roar</b> but more subdued and made when the mouth is partially or completely closed. Moaning can be heard [...] away. Chuffing, soft, low-frequency snorting similar to purring in smaller cats, is heard in more friendly situations. Other vocal communications include grunts, woofs, snarls, miaows, hisses and growls.|$|E
500|$|Sinbad brought Leno to the {{attention}} of Augustus Harris, the manager of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, one of the largest London theatres, which staged elaborate pantomime spectacles every Christmas. [...] Harris offered Leno a role in the theatre's 1888 Christmas pantomime, Babes in the Wood. One critic wrote that [...] "'the cake' for frolicsome humour is taken by the dapper new-comer, Mr. Dan Leno, who is sketched as the galvanic baroness in the wonderfully amusing dance which sets the house in <b>a</b> <b>roar.</b> The substantial [...] "babes", Mr. Herbert Campbell and Mr. Harry Nicholls, would have no excuse if they did not vie in drollery with the light footed Dan Leno." [...] Babes was a triumph: the theatre reported record attendance, and the run was extended until 27 April 1889. Leno went on to star in a total of 16 Christmas pantomimes at Drury Lane from 1888 to 1904. In 15 of these, he played alongside Herbert Campbell, a veteran pantomime performer, with Leno playing predominantly dame roles. Leno became famous for his characterisations of dame roles, and he was described as the [...] "precursor of contemporary pantomime dames".|$|E
