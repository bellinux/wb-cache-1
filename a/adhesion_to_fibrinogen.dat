40|$|Integrins {{regulate}} {{cell adhesion}} and motility through tyrosine kinases, but initiation {{of this process}} is poorly understood. We find here that Src associates constitutively with integrin �IIb� 3 in platelets. Platelet <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> <b>fibrinogen</b> caused a rapid increase in �IIb� 3 -associated Src activity, and active Src localized to filopodia and cell edges. Csk, which negatively regulates Src by phosphorylating Tyr- 529, was also constitutively associated with �IIb� 3. However, fibrinogen binding caused Csk to dissociate from �IIb� 3, concomitant with dephosphorylation of Src Tyr- 529 and phosphorylation of Src activation loop Tyr- 418. In contrast to the behavior of Src and Csk, Syk was associated with �IIb� 3 only after fibrinogen binding. Platelets multiply deficient in Src, Hck, Fgr, and Lyn, or normal platelets treated with Src kinase inhibitors failed to spread on fibrinogen. Inhibition of Src kinases blocked Syk activation and inhibited phosphorylation of Syk substrates (Vav 1, Vav 3, SLP- 76) implicated in cytoskeletal regulation. Syk-deficient platelets exhibited Src activation upon <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> <b>fibrinogen,</b> but no spreading or phosphorylation of Vav 1, Vav 3, and SLP- 76. These studies establish that platelet spreading on fibrinogen requires sequential activation of Src and Syk in proximity to �IIb� 3, thus providing a paradigm for initiation of integrin signaling to the actin cytoskeleton...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to set up and {{evaluate}} a novel method for studies of platelet adhesion and activation in blood and platelet suspensions such as platelet concentrate (PC) samples using protein-coated polystyrene beads and flow cytometry. To demonstrate its usefulness, we studied PCs during storage. PCs were prepared by aphaeresis technique (n[*]=[*] 7). Metabolic variables and platelet function was measured on day 1, 5, 7 and 12 of storage. Spontaneous and TRAP- 6 -induced adhesion to fibrinogen- and collagen-coated beads was analyzed by flow cytometry. P-selectin and phosphatidyl serine (PS) expression was assessed on platelets bound to beads as well as on non-adherent platelets. Platelet <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> <b>fibrinogen</b> beads had increased by day 12 and adhesion to collagen beads at day 7 of storage (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). TRAP- 6 stimulation significantly increased the platelet <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> <b>fibrinogen</b> beads (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) as well as the P-selectin and PS exposure on platelets bound to beads (p[*]<[*] 0. 01) during the first 7 days of storage, but by day 12, significant changes were no longer induced by TRAP- 6 stimulation. We demonstrate that our adhesion assay using protein-coated polystyrene beads can be used to assess the adhesion properties of platelets during storage without the addition of red blood cells. Therefore it may offer a useful tool for future studies of platelet adhesive capacity in transfusion medicine and other settings...|$|E

To investigate the cGMP-independent effects of NO we evaluated integrin beta(3) phosphorylation. <b>Adhesion</b> <b>to</b> <b>fibrinogen</b> induced rapid phosphorylation of beta(3) on tyrosines 773 and 785, which was reduced by GSNO in a cGMP independent manner.

Here we provide new insights into the requirements for FnBP-dependent biofilm formation by MRSA. We show that expression of FnBPs is sustained at high levels throughout the growth cycle in the HA-MRSA strain BH 1 CC in contrast to laboratory strain SH 1000, where expression could be detected only in exponential phase. We found that FnBP-mediated biofilm accumulation required Zn(2 +), while the removal of Zn(2 +) had no effect on the ability of FnBPA to mediate bacterial adherence to fibrinogen. We also investigated the role of FnBPA expressed on the surface of S. aureus in promoting biofilm formation and bacterial <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> <b>fibrinogen.</b> The minimum part of FnBPA required for ligand binding has so far been defined only with recombinant proteins. Here we found that the N 1 subdomain was not required for biofilm formation or for FnBPA to promote bacterial adherence to fibrinogen. Residues at the C terminus of subdomain N 3 required for FnBPA to bind to ligands using the "dock, lock, and latch" mechanism were necessary for FnBPA to promote bacterial adherence to fibrinogen. However, these residues were not necessary to form biofilm, allowing us to localize the region of FnBPA required for biofilm accumulation to residues 166 to 498. Thus, FnBPA mediates biofilm formation and bacterial <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> <b>fibrinogen</b> using two distinct mechanisms. Finally, we identified a hitherto-unrecognized thrombin cleavage site close to the boundary between subdomains N 1 and N 2 of FnBPA. ...|$|E

The snake-venom proteins preferentially inhibited the adhesion of ADP-treated platelets {{to one or more}} of the immobilized ligands. Kistrin and dendroaspin exhibited similar inhibitory characteristics, abrogating platelet <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> <b>fibrinogen</b> and vWF at nanomolar concentrations, but poorly inhibiting adhesion to fibronectin. Kistrin and dendroaspin share little overall amino-acid-sequence identity, but a considerable level of sequence similarity exists around the RGD tripeptide. Synthetic cyclic peptides corresponding to these regions of kistrin and dendroaspin inhibited platelet adhesion to both fibrinogen and fibronectin with approximately equal potency, but were 100 -fold weaker antagonists of the interactions of the alpha IIb beta 3 complex with fibrinogen than their parent proteins. The disintegrins elegantin and albolabrin, which share approx. 60 % overall amino-acid-sequence similarity with kistrin but have different residues around the RGD tripeptide, exhibited different antagonistic preferences. Elegantin inhibited platelet adhesion to immobilized vWF and fibronectin, but was significantly less effective at disrupting <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> <b>fibrinogen.</b> Albolabrin selectively inhibited platelet adhesion to immobilized vWF and was less effective with fibrinogen and fibronectin as adhesive ligands. In contrast with the behaviour of these venom proteins, the adhesion of ADP-treated platelets to immobilized fibrinogen, fibronectin and vWF was inhibited non-selectively by a range of monoclonal antibodies with specificity for the alpha IIb beta 3 complex. These observations, therefore, define antagonistic preferences in this panel of venom proteins towards the interactions of the alpha IIb beta 3 complex with three immobilized glycoprotein ligands...|$|E

Among them, isoprostanes, and in particular iPF(2 alpha) -III, seem to be crucial in mediating {{some of the key}} cellular events seen in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. METHODS AND RESULTS: Minimally modified LDL (MM-LDL) triggers a dose-dependent, very rapid neutrophil <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> human <b>fibrinogen.</b> Rapid <b>adhesion</b> triggering correlates with degree of LDL oxidation and accumulation of isoprostanes. Isoprostanes accumulated in MM-LDL are major determinants of the proadhesive effect of oxidized LDL, as shown by experiments of receptor functional deletion. Moreover, evidence is provided of expression on human neutrophils of a biological active isoprostane receptor distinct from the classical thromboxane A 2 receptor. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that isoprostanes are major contributors to the proadhesive effect induced by MM-LDL on neutrophils and provide additional evidence for the involvement of isoprostanes in the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury...|$|R
40|$|Granulocyte {{adhesion}} {{and release}} of their granule proteins are key steps during selective accumulation {{of a certain}} cell to an inflammatory site. Eosinophils are specifically recruited to sites of allergic inflammation and parasitic infection, whereas neutrophil influx predominates in bacterial infection and rheumatoid arthritis. A simple, reliable and convenient method was developed for the measurement of granulocyte adhesion and release of granule proteins by using the normal population of granulocytes. The design allows simultaneous quantitative assessment of eosinophil and neutrophil <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> proteins and degranulation. Using this method, manganese ions (Mn 2 +) induced {{a higher level of}} eosinophil <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> fibronectin, <b>fibrinogen</b> and albumin as compared with neutrophils. PMA induced comparable levels of eosinophil and neutrophil adhesion. F-MLP stimulated a rapid, short-term <b>adhesion</b> of neutrophils <b>to</b> <b>fibrinogen.</b> In the same conditions PMA alone stimulated a dose-dependent release of ECP from cells that adhered to both fibronectin and fibrinogen. Meanwhile, Mn 2 + amplified the release of ECP induced by PMA. Furthermore, release of ECP was shown to be associated with cell death. PMA, in combination with Mn 2 +, induced a marked release of ~ 80 %of the intracellular content of lactoferrin and HNL in neutrophils. PMA or f-MLP alone induced 30 - 40 % release of lactoferrin and HNL. A maximal release of MPO of 15 - 20 % was obtained from neutrophils stimulated by PMA and Mn 2 +. Release of lactoferrin and HNL showed a significant negative relationship to the viability of cells. Stimulated by PMA, eosinophils from pollen-atopic patients during early pollen season displayed a markedly enhanced adhesion and release of ECP of eosinophils compared with eosinophils from the references. Priming with IL- 5 caused a significantly higher adhesion and release of ECP by eosinophils in response to PMA. GM-CSF priming enhanced eosinophil <b>adhesion</b> in response <b>to</b> PAF and PMA plus Mn 2 +, but did not enhance the release of ECP. In conclusion, the assay allows a simple quantification of eosinophil and neutrophil adhesion, as well as degranulation by using the normal population of granulocytes. Cellular adhesion {{plays an important role in}} the regulation of both eosinophil and neutrophil degranulation, but adhesion and degranulation can be induced separately...|$|R

The mechanism(s) underlying keratinocyte movement in this precise pathway {{has not been}} previously addressed. Here we demonstrate that cultured human keratinocytes do not express functional fibrinogen/fibrin receptors, specifically αvβ 3. Biologic modifiers known to induce integrin expression or activation did not induce <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> fibrin, <b>fibrinogen,</b> or its fragments. Epidermal explant outgrowth and single epidermal cell migration failed to occur on either fibrin or fibrinogen. Surprisingly, fibrin and fibrinogen mixed at physiologic molar ratios with fibronectin abrogated keratinocyte attachment to fibronectin. Keratinocytes transduced with the β 3 integrin subunit cDNA, expressed αvβ 3 on their surface and attached to and spread on fibrinogen and fibrin. β-gal cDNA-transduced keratinocytes did not demonstrate this activity. Furthermore, β 3 cDNA-transduced keratinocyte <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> fibrin was inhibited by LM 609 monoclonal antibody to αvβ 3 in a concentration-dependent fashion. From these data, we conclude that normal human keratinocytes cannot interact with fibrinogen and its derivatives {{due to the lack}} of αvβ 3. Thus, fibrinogen and fibrin are authentic anti-adhesive for keratinocytes. This may be a fundamental reason why the migrating epidermis dissects the fibrin eschar from wounds...|$|R
40|$|The {{integrin}} O/L / 52 (leukocyte function-associated molecule 1, CDlla/CD 18) mediates activation-dependent adhesion of leukocytes. The cytoplasmic {{domains of}} O~g / 52 {{have been demonstrated}} to modulate adhesiveness of at/ 52 - Affinity changes of O/g / 52 for its ligand or postreceptor events can be responsible for this modulation of adhesiveness. To investigate the possible role of the O/g / 52 cytoplasmic domains in postreceptor events we constructed eDNA encoding chimeric proteins with intracellular O/g / 52 domains, which are responsible for C~L / 52 specific intracellular interactions, and extracellular c~iro/ 33 (GP IIb/IIIa) domains, which allow {{the assessment of the}} receptor affinity state. The eDNA was stably transfected in Chinese hamster ovary cells and chimeric heterodimer formation proven by immunoprecipitations and flow cytometry. The chimeric receptors mediate <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> immobilized <b>fibrinogen,</b> and this adhesion is increased by phorbol myristate acetate and abolished by cytochalasin D. However, neither treatment affects the affinity state of the chimeric receptor, suggesting involvement of the cytoskeleton in the regulation of r / 52 mediated cell <b>adhesion.</b> <b>To</b> exclude the possibility of postoccupancy affinity changes of the chimeric receptors, we locked the receptors into a high affinity state by creating a deletion variant. The region deleted (VGFFK) is highly conserved in integrin ce subuni...|$|R
40|$|Ten Staphylococcus caprae strains {{isolated}} from four patients and responsible for bone infections following implantation of orthopaedic material {{were compared to}} four S. caprae strains collected from milk samples of healthy goats. The following characteristics were investigated: Smal patterns, hybridization patterns with pBA 2 (ribotypes), slime production, <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> matrix proteins (<b>fibrinogen,</b> fibronectin, collagen) and the staphylococcal adhesion genes (fnbA, clfA, cna, atlE, ica, fbe). None of the characteristics enabled us to distinguish the human strains from the goat strains. Slime was occasionally produced by S. caprae strains {{but all of them}} carried nucleotide sequences hybridizing at low stringency with the following genes: atlE encoding a S. epidermidis autolysin binding vitronectin and responsible for the primary <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> polystyrene, ica operon involved in the biosynthesis of a S. epidermidis extracellular polysaccharide, and the part of clfA encoding the serine-aspartate repeated region of a S. aureus cell-wall fibrinogen-binding protein...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Factor XIII (FXIII), a plasma pro-transglutaminase, {{consists}} of two A subunits and two B subunits (FXIIIA 2 B 2). Following activation by thrombin, it cross-links fibrin chains at the final step of coagulation. We previously reported that FXIII subunit A (FXIIIA) serves as a protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), and that PDI promotes platelet adhesion and aggregation. OBJECTIVE This study sought to examine possible mechanistic effect of FXIII on platelet adhesion to fibrinogen; specifically, the role of its PDI activity. METHODS Ex vivo experiments: Blood platelets derived from five patients with hereditary FXIIIA deficiency before and after treatment with Fibrogammin-P (FXIIIA 2 B 2 concentrate) were washed and incubated on immobilized fibrinogen. Bound platelets were stained and counted by microscopy. In vitro experiments: Platelets derived from patients before treatment and five healthy controls were washed and analyzed for adhesion in {{the presence or absence}} of Fibrogammin-P or recombinant FXIII (FXIIIA 2 concentrate). RESULTS In ex vivo experiments, one hour after Fibrogammin-P treatment, mean (±SEM) platelet <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> <b>fibrinogen</b> increased by 27 ± 2. 32...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} ligand density on integrin-mediated cell {{adhesion}} and outside-in signaling {{is not well}} understood. Using total internal reflection fluorescent microscopy, conformation-specific antibodies, and Ca 2 + flux measurements, {{we found that the}} surface density of fibrinogen affects αIIbβ 3 -mediated platelet signaling, adhesion, and spreading. <b>Adhesion</b> <b>to</b> <b>fibrinogen</b> immobilized at low density leads to rapid increases in cytosolic Ca 2 + and sequential formation of filopodia and lamellipodia. In contrast, adhesion to high-density fibrinogen results in transient or no increases in Ca 2 + and simultaneous formation of filopodia and lamellipodia. αIIbβ 3 receptors at the basal surface of platelets engage fibrinogen in a ringlike pattern at the cell edges under both conditions. This engagement is, however, more dynamic and easily reversed on high-density fibrinogen. Src and Rac activity and actin polymerization are important for adhesion to low-density fibrinogen, whereas PKC/PI 3 kinases contribute to platelet spreading on high-density fibrinogen. We conclude that 2 fundamentally different signaling mechanisms can be initiated by a single integrin receptor interacting with the same ligand when it is immobilized at different densities...|$|E
40|$|The {{integrin}} αIIbβ 3 on resting platelets {{can bind to}} immobilised fibrinogen {{resulting in}} platelet spreading and activation but requires activation to bind to soluble fibrinogen. αIIbβ 3 is known {{to interact with the}} general integrin-recognition motif RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartate) as well as the fibrinogen-specific γ-chain dodecapeptide; however, it is not known how fibrinogen binding triggers platelet activation. NGR (asparagine-glycine-arginine) is another integrin-recognition sequence present in fibrinogen and this study aims to determine if it plays a role in the interaction between fibrinogen and αIIbβ 3. NGR-containing peptides inhibited resting platelet <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> <b>fibrinogen</b> with an IC 50 of 175 µM but failed to inhibit the adhesion of activated platelets to fibrinogen (IC 503 ̆e[*] 500 µM). Resting platelet adhesion to mutant fibrinogens lacking the NGR sequences was reduced compared to normal fibrinogen under both static and shear conditions (200 s⁻¹). However, pre-activated platelets were able to fully spread on all types of fibrinogen. Thus, the NGR motif in fibrinogen is the site that is primarily responsible for the interaction with resting αIIbβ 3 and is responsible for triggering platelet activation...|$|E
40|$|A monomeric RGD-disintegrin was {{recently}} identified from a cDNA library from the venom gland of Bothrops alternatus. The corresponding 12 kDa-recombinant protein, DisBa- 01, specifically interacted with alpha(v) beta 3 integrin and displayed potent anti-metastatic and anti-angiogenic properties. Here, {{the interaction of}} DisBa- 01 with platelet alphaIIb beta 3 integrin {{and its effects on}} hemostasis and thrombosis were investigated. DisBa- 01 bound to Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells expressing beta 3 or alphaIIb beta 3 and promoted their adhesion and the adhesion of resting platelets onto glass coverslips. The disintegrin inhibited the binding of FITC-fibrinogen and FITC-PAC- 1 to ADP-stimulated platelets and inhibited ADP-, TRAP- and collagen-induced aggregation of murine, rabbit or human platelets. In a flow chamber assay, DisBa- 01 inhibited and reverted platelet <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> immobilized <b>fibrinogen.</b> DisBa- 01 inhibited the phosphorylation of FAK following platelet activation. The intravenous injection of DisBa- 01 in C 57 Bl 6 /j mice, prolonged tail bleeding time as well as thrombotic occlusion time in mesenteric venules and arterioles following vessel injury with FeCl 3. In conclusion, DisBa- 01 antagonizes the platelet alphaIIb beta 3 integrin and potently inhibits thrombosis. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Ibrutinib is an {{irreversible}} Bruton {{tyrosine kinase}} inhibitor approved {{for treatment of}} Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and mantle cell lymphoma that {{increases the risk of}} bleeding among patients. Platelets from ibrutinib-treated patients exhibit deficiencies in collagen-evoked signaling in suspension; however, the significance of this observation and how it relates to bleeding risk is unclear, as platelets encounter immobile collagen in vivo. We sought to clarify the effects of ibrutinib on platelet function to better understand the mechanism underlying bleeding risk. APPROACH AND RESULTS: By comparing signaling in suspension and during <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> immobilized ligands, we found that the collagen signaling deficiency caused by ibrutinib is milder during <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> immobilized collagen. We also found that platelets in whole blood treated with ibrutinib adhered to collagen under arterial shear but formed unstable thrombi, suggesting that the collagen signaling deficiency caused by ibrutinib may not be the predominant cause of bleeding in vivo. However, clot retraction and signaling evoked by platelet <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> immobilized <b>fibrinogen</b> were also inhibited by ibrutinib, indicating that integrin αIIbβ 3 outside-in signaling is also effected in addition to GPVI signaling. When ibrutinib was combined with the P 2 Y 12 inhibitor, cangrelor, thrombus formation under arterial shear was inhibited additively. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that (1) ibrutinib causes GPVI and integrin αIIbβ 3 platelet signaling deficiencies that result in formation of unstable thrombi and may contribute toward bleeding observed in vivo and (2) combining ibrutinib with P 2 Y 12 antagonists, which also inhibit thrombus stability, may have a detrimental effect on hemostasis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{kinetics}} of <b>adhesion</b> of platelets <b>to</b> <b>fibrinogen</b> (Fg) {{immobilized on}} polystyrene latex beads (Fg-beads) was determined in suspensions undergoing Couette flow at well-defined homogeneous shear rates. The efficiency of platelet <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> Fg-beads was compared for ADP-activated versus “resting” platelets. The {{effects of the}} shear rate (100 – 2000 s− 1), Fg density on the beads (24 – 2882 Fg/μm 2), the concentration of ADP used to activate the platelets, {{and the presence of}} soluble fibrinogen were assessed. “Resting” platelets did not specifically adhere to Fg-beads at levels detectable with our methodology. The apparent efficiency of platelet <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> Fg-beads readily correlated with the proportion of platelets “quantally” activated by doses of ADP, i. e., only ADP-activated platelets appeared to adhere to Fg-beads, with a maximal adhesion efficiency of 6 – 10 % at shear rates of 100 – 300 s− 1, decreasing with increasing shear rates up to 2000 s− 1. The adhesion efficiency was found to decrease by only threefold when decreasing the density of Fg at the surface of the beads by 100 -fold, with only moderate decreases in the presence of physiologic concentrations of soluble Fg. These adhesive interactions were also compared using activated GPIIbIIIa-coated beads. Our studies provide novel model particles for studying platelet <b>adhesion</b> relevant <b>to</b> hemostasis and thrombosis, and show how the state of activation of the platelet and the local flow conditions regulate Fg-dependent adhesion...|$|R
