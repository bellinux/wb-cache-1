500|$|In 1926, Williams {{mandated}} {{the use of}} {{parachutes for}} all RAAF aircrew. He had visited the Irvin <b>Air</b> <b>Chute</b> Company while in the US during 1924 and recommended purchase at the time, but a backlog of orders for the RAF meant that the Australian equipment took almost two years to arrive. Flying Officer Ellis Wackett was assigned to instruct volunteers at RAAF Richmond, and made the country's first freefall descent from a military aircraft, an Airco DH.9, on 26May. Williams himself jumped over Point Cook on 5August, having decided that it would set [...] "a good example if, before issuing an order for the compulsory wearing of parachutes, I showed my own confidence in them..." [...] Though his descent took him perilously close to the base water tank ("I {{thought it would be}} a poor ending to drown there, or even to be pulled out dripping wet") and [...] "too close to be comfortable to a 30,000 volt electric transmission line", he completed the exercise unscathed.|$|E
2500|$|Electricity was {{provided}} via a bleed air-driven turbine {{housed in the}} rear fuselage, which in turn drove an AC alternator and DC generator; the approach was considered unusual at the time due to most aircraft using driveshaft-driven generators/alternators for electrical energy. A 28V DC battery provided emergency backup power. Aviation author Kev Darling stated of the Lightning: [...] "Never before had a fighter been so dependent upon electronics". Each engine was equipped {{with a pair of}} hydraulic pumps, one of which would provide pressure for the flight-control systems and the other, pressure for the undercarriage, flaps, and airbrakes; switchable hydraulic circuits were used for redundancy {{in the event of a}} leak or other failure. A combination of Dunlop Maxaret anti-skid brakes on the main wheels and an Irvin <b>Air</b> <b>Chute</b> braking parachute slowed the aircraft during landing; a tailhook was also fitted. Accumulators on the wheel brakes performed as backups to the hydraulics, providing minimal braking. Above a certain airspeed a stopped engine would 'windmill', i.e., continue to be rotated by the air flowing through it in a similar manner to a ram air turbine, sufficiently to still generate adequate hydraulic power for the powered controls during flight.|$|E

40|$|Interaction {{between the}} free {{surface and the}} bed {{material}} in flow over rock chutes under macroroughness conditions leads to a high air entrainment into the flow. The note reports on an experimental study about air diffusion features in the flow over a long rock <b>chute.</b> <b>Air</b> concentration profiles and water depths over a uniform bed material were measured. An empirical equation for the average air concentration in macroroughness condition for steep slopes is proposed. A new Darcy-Weisbach equivalent friction factor for long chutes {{as a function of}} the slope and the relative equivalent depth has also been found...|$|R
40|$|A multi-year, {{large-scale}} {{physical model}} study of stepped chutes was conducted over {{a broad range}} of design parameters (i. e. step heights, slopes, and unit discharges). Air entrainment developed naturally as the flow descended the <b>chute.</b> <b>Air</b> entrainment began to develop downstream of the surface inception point at L/Li = 1. 0, and it became fully developed at approximately L/Li = 2. 0. Depending on the chute slope, energy loss in the model ranged from 20 % near L/Li = 1. 0 to as much as 85 % near L/Li = 6. 0. The contributions of this study are the development of flow depth, clear-water flow depth, and energy coefficient relationships for stepped chutes with slopes ranging from 10 to 30 °. Although stepped chutes provide significant energy dissipation, large steps may have an adverse effect on the resulting Froude number; consequently, a longer stilling basin may be required then one might expect. The results of this research are expected to make a significant impact of the design of these structures...|$|R
40|$|In {{open channel}} flows an {{important}} design parameter {{is the amount}} of entrained air. The presence of air in high velocity flows or steep chutes increases the bulk of the flow and this is a design parameter that determines the height of chute sidewalls. Furthermore the presence of air within the boundary layer reduces the shear stress between flow layers and hence the shear forces. The resulting increase of fluid motion must be taken in account when designing ski jump and stilling basin downstream of a spillway. Besides the presence of air within high-velocity flows may prevent or reduce cavitation damage. Estimation of the quantity of air entrained along the spillway is required by the design engineer when sitting aerators to artificially introduce more air, or determining whether aerators are required. Recently <b>air</b> entrainment on <b>chutes</b> has also been recognized for its contribution to air-water transfer of atmospheric gases such as oxygen and nitrogen. This article describes a general method to compute the flow characteristics of self-aerated flows. Firstly the uniform flow conditions are presented and comparisons will be made between model and prototype results. Then the basic equations for gradually varied aerated flows will be developed, and these results are discussed and compared with experimental data...|$|R
50|$|Excelsior Motor Company, {{a former}} {{motorcycle}} company, bought Britax Group for £880,000 in March 1963. It diversified into aircraft interiors and seating, car mirrors and car seating. Its main competitor in the 1960s was Irvin <b>Air</b> <b>Chute,</b> {{which had been}} Britain's main manufacturer and designer of parachutes.|$|E
50|$|Irving <b>Air</b> <b>Chute</b> {{had become}} the largest {{parachute}} manufacturer in the world. By 1939, 45 foreign countries were using Irving parachutes, including Germany, which had confiscated an Irving plant and bought its patents in 1936. During the Second World War, Irving parachutes alone saved over 10,000 lives.|$|E
50|$|An early {{brochure}} of the Irving <b>Air</b> <b>Chute</b> Company credits William O'Connor 24 August 1920 at McCook Field as {{the first}} person to be saved by an Irving parachute. Two years later, Irvin's company instituted the Caterpillar Club, awarding a gold pin to pilots who successfully bailed out of disabled aircraft using an Irving parachute.|$|E
40|$|Transfer chutes are {{essential}} components {{in almost all}} bulk material handling plants. Belt conveyors utilize transfer chutes to load and redirect bulk materials from one conveyor to another, with their reliability and performance being critical to the overall operation of the plant. While reliability and operational performance is typically measured by availability and throughput, transfer chutes must also operate with minimal environmental impact. Consequently, the design of transfer chutes in relation to entrained air flow, {{with the aim of}} minimizing fugitive dust emissions, is an area of ongoing research and investigation requiring the analysis of complex multiphase systems. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been successfully applied to evaluate potential dust emissions from transfer chutes, with the implementation of appropriate models and modelling parameters shown to be critical to the overall accuracy of the simulation results. A notable shortcoming in the current research is the lack of systematic guidelines available to appropriately select model parameters. The aim {{of this paper is to}} offer guidance in this regard, and provide a better understanding of the influence of the maximum fractional packing limit and evaluate the most appropriate model parameters for simulations, including particle-particle restitution coefficient values and solid slip conditions. For this purpose, the two-phase three-dimensional Euler-Euler model of commercial CFD software Fluent has been selected to model the granular and air flow in the transfer <b>chute.</b> <b>Air</b> velocities were measured experimentally by Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) with the simulated velocity profiles being in good overall agreement with the experimental data. 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|La {{conservation}} du sperme de truite arc-en-ciel prélevé 1 mois et demi après le début de la spermiation a été testée {{in vitro}} à l'air ou sous atmosphère d'O 2 et à température ambiante (9 ° C) pendant 24 h. Le pouvoir fécondant a été mesuré par le pourcentage d'œufs embryonnés à 300 degrés-jours.

The storage of rainbow trout sperm, taken 1 1 / 2 {{months after the}} onset of spermiation, was tested in vitro {{in the air and}} under O 2 at a room temperature of 9 ° C for 24 hrs. Fertilizing ability was assessed by the percentage of eyed-eggs at 300 degreesdays. Sperm was diluted to 1 / 1 000 (10 – 3) to inseminate ova, taken for each test, from a group of females. When the sperm was stored in the air, the fertility rate dropped more rapidly than when it was kept under O 2 (P< 0, 05 at 12 hrs). In both cases, initial fertilizing abilitywas only maintained for 6 hrs. This storage time is rather brief as compared to data in the literature but the high dilution rates used in this experiment probably allowed us to detect the aging processes occuring early in in vitro storage. Ovum survival at 9 ° C under O 2 was only slightly improved as compared to survival in cœlomic fluid...|$|R
50|$|Less {{than two}} months later, the Irving <b>Air</b> <b>Chute</b> Company was formed in Buffalo, New York, the world’s first {{parachute}} designer and manufacturer. Legend has it that 'Irvin' was inadvertently changed to 'Irving' by a secretary who mistakenly tacked a 'g' {{on the end of}} the name, and the company never bothered to correct the mistake until 1970.|$|E
50|$|The {{successor}} to the original Irvin company still provides pins {{to people who have}} made a jump. In addition to the Irvin <b>Air</b> <b>Chute</b> Company, other parachute manufacturers have also issued caterpillar pins for successful jumps. GC Parachutes formed their Gold Club in 1940. The Switlik Parachute Company of Trenton, New Jersey issued both gold and silver caterpillar pins. The Pioneer Parachute Co. in Skokie, Illinois, also presented plaques to people who packed the parachutes that saved lives.|$|E
50|$|Irvin {{became the}} first person to make a premeditated {{free-fall}} parachute jump from an airplane. An early brochure of the Irvin <b>Air</b> <b>Chute</b> Company credits William O'Connor as having become, on August 24, 1920 at McCook Field near Dayton, Ohio, {{the first person to}} be saved by an Irvin parachute. Another life-saving jump was made at McCook Field by test pilot Lt. Harold H. Harris on October 20, 1922. Shortly after Harris' jump, two Dayton newspaper reporters suggested the creation of the Caterpillar Club for successful parachute jumps from disabled aircraft.|$|E
50|$|As {{aircraft}} flew at {{ever increasing}} altitudes, pilots and aircrew {{were subject to}} ever lower temperatures, and Irvin designed and manufactured the classic sheepskin flying jacket to meet aviators' special requirements. Later the company also made car seat belts, slings for cargo handling, and even canning machinery. In 1970, the company finally removed the misnomic 'g' from its name, becoming Irvin <b>Air</b> <b>Chute,</b> and in 1996, changed its name again to Irvin Aerospace Inc. In addition to parachutes, the company (now Airborne Systems) specializes in a diverse range of products for global aerospace and military markets.|$|E
5000|$|In 1910, Van Meter {{became the}} {{inventor}} of the first successful backpack parachute and filed for a patent on March 27, 1911. On July 25, 1916, he was granted patents on [...] "inventions for saving the lives of aviators by the use of parachutes." [...] including the Aviatory Life Buoy, Patent # 1,192,479. [...] Van Meter joined the United States Army in 1917 in the wake of World War I. He, and two other students in his class, were commissioned to First Lieutenant of the Marine Corps Aviation. A model of his invention was built at Wright Field in 1918. After its successful testing, the United States Army allowed the Irving <b>Air</b> <b>Chute</b> Company to build parachutes for government use. In the meantime, Van Meter was assigned to McCook Field in Dayton, Ohio, where he was sent to improve his invention. Lt. Van Meter tested his invention himself on June 14, 1926 at West Point Academy.|$|E

The radar had a limited range and no track while scanning capability, and it could detect targets only in a fairly narrow (40 degree) arc. While an automatic collision course attack system was developed and successfully demonstrated by English Electric, it was not adopted due to cost concerns. Plans were mooted to supplement or replace the obsolete Red Top and Firestreak missiles with modern AIM-9L Sidewinder missiles to help rectify some of the obsolescence, but these ambitions were never realised due to lack of funding. An alternative to the modernization of existing aircraft would have been the development of more advanced variants; a proposed Variable-sweep wing Lightning would have likely involved the adoption of a new powerplant and radar and was believed by BAC to significantly increase performance, but ultimately was not pursued.|$|E
