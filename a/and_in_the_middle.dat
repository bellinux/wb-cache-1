5|$|Gibson {{was active}} {{in what is now}} the army reserve. He was made a {{lieutenant}} in the Melbourne University Rifles in 1922, and by the time of World War II had risen to the rank of major in the reserves. Seconded to the Second Australian Imperial Force on 13 May 1940, Gibson served in Australia <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> east (1940–1942), where he performed adjutant and quartermaster-general duties.

5|$|In June 1957, Plath and Hughes {{moved to}} the United States, and from September, Plath taught at Smith College, her alma mater. She found it {{difficult}} to both teach and have enough time and energy to write <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of 1958, the couple moved to Boston. Plath {{took a job as a}} receptionist in the psychiatric unit of Massachusetts General Hospital and in the evening sat in on creative writing seminars given by poet Robert Lowell (also attended by the writers Anne Sexton and George Starbuck).|$|E

5|$|Various {{anatomical}} {{features of}} the goblin shark, such as its flabby body and small fins, {{suggest that it is}} sluggish in nature. This species hunts for teleost fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans both near the sea floor <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the water column. Its long snout is covered with ampullae of Lorenzini that enable it to sense minute electric fields produced by nearby prey, which it can snatch up by rapidly extending its jaws. Small numbers of goblin sharks are unintentionally caught by deepwater fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern, despite its rarity, citing its wide distribution and low incidence of capture.|$|E
5|$|With the Ottomans' hold on Constantinople {{de facto}} {{recognized}} by Europe's lack of action, the Ottomans {{went on to}} facilitate further conquests in Europe <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> East. Their power finally reached a peak in the mid 17th century. Their success through the Janissaries became their new weakness; conservative and extremely powerful, Ottoman reform was difficult to implement whilst European armies became increasingly more resourceful and modernized. As a result, Russian and Austrian attempts to contain the Ottoman threat {{became more and more}} a formality until the official dissolution of the Empire after World War I.|$|E

5|$|Anomalous X-ray {{scattering}} (MAD or SAD phasing)– the X-ray wavelength may be scanned past an {{absorption edge}} of an atom, which changes the scattering in a known way. By recording full sets of reflections at three different wavelengths (far below, far above <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the absorption edge) one can solve for the substructure of the anomalously diffracting atoms and hence {{the structure of the}} whole molecule. The most popular method of incorporating anomalous scattering atoms into proteins is to express the protein in a methionine auxotroph (a host incapable of synthesizing methionine) in a media rich in seleno-methionine, which contains selenium atoms. A MAD experiment can then be conducted around the absorption edge, which should then yield the position of any methionine residues within the protein, providing initial phases.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of agnatic kinship and a feudal system of obligation {{has been seen}} as creating the highland clan system, evident in records from the 13th century. Surnames were rare in the highlands until the 17th and 18th centuries <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> Ages all members of a clan did not share a name and most ordinary members were usually not related to its head. The head of a clan {{in the beginning of the}} era was often the strongest male in the main sept or branch of the clan, but later, as primogeniture began to dominate, was usually the eldest son of the last chief. The leading families of a clan formed the fine, often seen as equivalent to lowland gentlemen, providing council in peace and leadership in war, and below them were the daoine usisle (in Gaelic) or tacksmen (in Scots), who managed the clan lands and collected the rents. In the isles and along the adjacent western seaboard there were also buannachann, who acted as a military elite, defending the clan lands from raids or taking part in attacks on clan enemies. Most of the followers of the clan were tenants, who supplied labour to the clan heads and sometimes act as soldiers. In the early modern era they would take the clan name as their surname, turning the clan into a massive, if often fictive, kin group.|$|E
