5|$|During the 2010 WWE draft on April 26, Kelly {{was drafted}} to the SmackDown brand. She made her debut on the April 30 episode of SmackDown, teaming with Beth Phoenix to defeat LayCool (Michelle McCool and Layla). She {{went on to}} feud with LayCool, gaining <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>in</b> Tiffany. Over the next several weeks, Kelly and Tiffany faced LayCool in tag team matches, with LayCool winning on both occasions. On the June 4 episode of SmackDown, Kelly made her singles debut for the brand, {{defeating}} Rosa Mendes, despite being distracted by Layla and McCool. After defeating both Layla and McCool in singles matches, Kelly received a WWE Women's Championship match at Money in the Bank in July, but was unsuccessful. On August 31, Kelly announced {{that she would be}} a mentor on the all-female third season of NXT, with Naomi as her rookie. Throughout the second half of 2010, Kelly continued to feud with LayCool, and gained <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>in</b> Natalya in October. In November, Kelly's NXT rookie, Naomi, was named runner-up to the winner, Kaitlyn, during the season finale.|$|E
5|$|In {{her plan}} {{to kill her}} husband she found <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>in</b> Helmichis, the king's foster brother and spatharius (arms bearer). According to Paul the queen then {{recruited}} the king's cubicularius (bedchamberlain), Peredeo, into the plot, after having seduced him. When Alboin retired for his midday rest on June 28, care was taken to leave {{the door open and}} unguarded. Alboin's sword was also removed, leaving him defenceless when Peredeo entered his room and killed him. Alboin's remains were allegedly buried beneath the palace steps.|$|E
5|$|On 28 January, August the Strong congratulated Frederick, yet not as Polish king, but as Saxon elector. In February, Denmark–Norway {{accepted}} Frederick's elevation {{in hope of}} <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>in</b> the Great Northern War, and the Tsardom of Russia likewise {{approved in}} 1701. Most princes of the Holy Roman Empire followed. Charles XII of Sweden accepted Frederick as Prussian king in 1703. In 1713, France and Spain also accepted Frederick's royal status.|$|E

5|$|The United States, however, found <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>in</b> Buenos Aires' main daily newspaper, La Prensa. The owner, editor, {{and naval}} editor {{were all in}} favor of {{acquiring}} American-designed dreadnoughts. In addition, the paper found evidence of British wrongdoing in a related naval contract. Under public pressure, the naval commission was forced to reconsider its original list, which had placed Italy first and Britain second. It now featured the United States first, Britain second, and Italy last.|$|E
5|$|Charles X Gustav then granted Frederick William full {{sovereignty}} in the Duchy of Prussia {{in return for}} military aid, and in the Treaty of Radnot allied himself with the Transylvanian George II Rákóczi who invaded Poland–Lithuania from the southeast. John II Vasa found <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>in</b> Leopold I of Habsburg, whose armies crossed into Poland–Lithuania from the southwest. This triggered Frederick III of Denmark's invasion of the Swedish mainland {{in the spring of}} 1657, in an attempt to settle old scores from the Torstenson War while Sweden was busy elsewhere. Brandenburg left the alliance with Sweden when granted full {{sovereignty in}} the Duchy of Prussia by the Polish king in the treaties of Wehlau and Bromberg.|$|E
5|$|The {{diplomatic}} context at Constance {{included the}} revolt of the Bohemian Hussites, who looked upon Poland as <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>in</b> their wars against Sigismund, the emperor elect and new king of Bohemia. In 1421, the Bohemian Diet declared Sigismund deposed and formally offered the crown to Władysław {{on condition that}} he accept the religious principles of the Four Articles of Prague, which he {{was not prepared to}} do. After Władysław's refusal, Vytautas was postulated (elected in absentia) as Bohemian king, but he assured the pope that he opposed the heretics. Between 1422 and 1428, Władysław's nephew, Sigismund Korybut, attempted a regency in war-torn Bohemia, with little success. Vytautas accepted Sigismund's offer of a royal crown in 1429 — apparently with Władysław's blessing — but Polish forces intercepted the crown in transit and the coronation was cancelled.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the late}} 1830s and early 1840s, Rosas faced {{a series of}} major threats to his power. The Unitarians found <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>in</b> Andrés de Santa Cruz, the ruler of the Peru–Bolivian Confederation. Rosas {{declared}} war against the Peru–Bolivian Confederation on 19 March 1837, joining the War of the Confederation between Chile and Peru–Bolivia. The Rosista army played a minor role in the conflict, {{which resulted in the}} overthrow of Santa Cruz and the dissolution of the Peru–Bolivian Confederation. On 28 March 1838, France declared a blockade of the Port of Buenos Aires, eager to extend its influence over the region. Unable to confront the French, Rosas increased internal repression to forestall potential uprisings against his regime.|$|E
5|$|Born in Panama City to a poor mestizo family, Noriega {{studied at}} the Chorrillos Military School in Lima and at the School of the Americas. He became {{an officer in the}} Panamanian army, and rose through the ranks in {{alliance}} with Omar Torrijos. In 1968, Torrijos overthrew President Arnulfo Arias in a coup, establishing himself as leader; under Torrijos' government, Noriega became chief of military intelligence. After Torrijos' death in 1981, Noriega consolidated his power to become Panama's de facto ruler in 1983. From the 1950s until shortly before the U.S. invasion, Noriega worked with U.S. intelligence agencies. Noriega was one of the Central Intelligence Agency's most valued intelligence sources, as well as one of the primary conduits for illicit weapons, military equipment and cash destined for U.S.-backed counter-insurgency forces throughout Latin America. The U.S. also regarded Noriega as <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>in</b> its War on Drugs, despite Noriega himself having amassed a personal fortune through drug trafficking operations. Though his U.S. intelligence handlers were aware of this, it was allowed because of his usefulness to the U.S.|$|E
5|$|In late 1108 {{or early}} 1109, Henry V, then the King of the Romans, sent envoys to Normandy proposing that Matilda marry him, and wrote {{separately}} {{to her mother}} on the same matter. The match was attractive to the English King: his daughter would be marrying {{into one of the}} most prestigious dynasties in Europe, reaffirming his own, slightly questionable, status as the youngest son of a new royal house, and gaining him <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>in</b> dealing with France. In return, Henry V would receive a dowry of 10,000 marks, which he needed to fund an expedition to Rome for his coronation as the Holy Roman Emperor. The final details of the deal were negotiated at Westminster in June 1109 and, as a result of her changing status, Matilda attended a royal council for the first time that October. She left England in February 1110 to make her way to Germany.|$|E

5|$|The American {{official}} most {{associated with}} the conflict in Laos was Ambassador William H. Sullivan, who served from December 1964 until June 1969. He {{was also one of}} the most controversial. Considered brilliant by most and tyrannical by many, Sullivan was despised by the American high command (both Army and Air Force) in Saigon, Sullivan's demand that he alone maintain complete control over every aspect of American military operations in Laos and the stringent restrictions that he imposed upon those operations, earned him few friends among the military. Few of his detractors, however, considered the difficulties of the ambassador's position. He had to balance the competing interests of the CIA, the Seventh Air Force, MACV, and the Thais, and this had to be done without alienating Souvanna Phouma, <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>in</b> all but name who acquiesced to almost every U.S. action within his country, short of outright invasion.|$|E
5|$|Kerrigan's {{character}} is more central to StarCraft: Brood War (1998), {{as in the}} wake of the Overmind's death at the hands of Tassadar in the conclusion of StarCraft, Kerrigan regains her independence from the Zerg hive mind and dedicates her efforts to becoming the sole leader of the Zerg Swarm. She presents herself on the Protoss colony world Shakuras, where she informs Zeratul and the Protoss of a new Overmind growing on Char, manipulating them into destroying Zerg forces running rival to her goals. She also gains <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>in</b> an apparently infested Samir Duran, who infiltrates the newly arrived forces of the United Earth Directorate (UED) and attempts to sabotage their mission to enslave the Zerg and seize control of the sector of the galaxy. However, the UED is successful in capturing the new Overmind, and Kerrigan exploits the threat of the UED to forge an alliance with Mengsk, Raynor and his new Protoss allies, turning around the war against the UED. However, Kerrigan quickly betrays this alliance and strikes at the armies of Raynor and Mengsk, heavily damaging both groups. Accompanied by Duran, Kerrigan returns to Shakuras to abduct the Protoss leader Raszagal, using her to blackmail Zeratul into killing the new Overmind on Char, after which all Zerg fall under Kerrigan's control—around this time, she begins her self-proclamation as the Queen of Blades. Zeratul attempts to rescue Raszagal, but kills her when he realizes her mind has been destroyed by Kerrigan's brainwashing. Kerrigan, surprised by his actions, allows him to live. Soon after, Kerrigan's position on Char is attacked by a vengeful Protoss fleet, the remnants of the UED's invasion force and a mercenary fleet commanded by Mengsk. Despite being outnumbered, Kerrigan's forces prevail, crippling her enemies and eradicating the UED fleet, thereby securing a dominant position in the sector.|$|E
5|$|Raszagal was the matriarch of the Nerazim on Shakuras, {{and mother}} to Vorazun. The {{character}} appears in Brood War, {{where she is}} voiced by Debra DeLiso, and in the novel Shadow Hunters. Described {{as one of the}} oldest living Protoss and imbued with tremendous psychic powers, {{she is one of the}} few to clearly remember the Protoss homeworld from before the exile of the Nerazim. During her youth, Raszagal was important in ensuring the dark templar were only exiled, rather than exterminated. In Brood War, Raszagal directs Zeratul and Artanis to cleanse the Zerg from Shakuras and welcomes Sarah Kerrigan as <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>in</b> their mission. This spurs Aldaris to rebellion; Raszagal consequently orders his death. Kerrigan and Samir Duran later kidnap Raszagal from Shakuras, using her to blackmail Zeratul into killing the second Overmind. It quickly becomes apparent that Kerrigan has mentally subverted Raszagal and has been using her to manipulate events from the beginning. Zeratul captures Raszagal, but is unable to hold off the Zerg forces long enough to escape. Realizing that the matriarch is beyond redemption from Kerrigan's influence, Zeratul kills Raszagal. Raszagal's mind is freed by the lethal blow, and she dies thanking Zeratul for releasing her, naming him as her successor as leader of the dark templar.|$|E

The Guggenheim family, especially Harry Guggenheim, would continue to support Goddard's work in the years to come. The Goddards soon moved to Roswell, New Mexico.|$|E
25|$|The {{marriage}} with Oda considerably affected {{the position and}} prestige of Mieszko, who entered the world of Saxon aristocracy. As a son-in-law of Margrave Dietrich, he gained <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>in</b> {{one of the most}} influential politicians of the Holy Roman Empire. As the Margrave was a distant relative of the Emperor, Mieszko became a member of the circle connected to the imperial ruling house.|$|E
25|$|Hume {{was very}} {{interested}} in the development of agriculture.

Hume noted in his Agricultural reform in India that Lord Mayo had been the only Viceroy who had any experience of working in the fields.|$|E

In Tyrone, Hugh's cousin, Turlough Luineach O'Neill had succeeded Shane O'Neill as The O'Neill, or chieftain, but was not recognized by the English as the legitimate Earl of Tyrone. The crown therefore supported Hugh O'Neill as the rightful claimant and as <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>in</b> Gaelic controlled Ulster.|$|E
25|$|The {{failure of}} Hugo de Sully's {{expedition}} convinced Charles of Anjou that {{an invasion of}} the Byzantine Empire by land was not feasible, and he thus considered a naval expedition against Byzantium. He found <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> <b>in</b> Venice and in July 1281, the Treaty of Orvieto formalized this collaboration. Its stated purpose was the dethronement of Michael VIII {{in favor of the}} titular Latin emperor Philip of Courtenay and the forcible establishment of the Union of the Churches, bringing the Greek Orthodox Church under the authority of the Pope. Its principal motivation, however, was to re-establish the Latin Empire, under Angevin domination, and to restore Venetian commercial privileges in Constantinople.|$|E
