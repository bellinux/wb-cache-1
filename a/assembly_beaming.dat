40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we propose a finite element {{approach}} which simulates the mechanical behaviour of <b>beam</b> <b>assemblies</b> that are subject to large deformations and that develop contact-friction interactions. We focus on detecting and modeling contact-friction interactions within the <b>assembly</b> of <b>beams.</b> Contact between beams [...] or between parts of the same beam in the case of self-contact, is detected from intermediate geometries defined within proximity zones associating close parts of beam axes. The discretization of contact-friction interactions is performed on these intermediate geometries by means of contact elements, constituted of pairs of material particles which are predicted to enter into contact. A 3 D finite strain beam model is used to represent the behaviour of each beam. This model describes the kinematics of each beam cross-section using nine degrees of freedom, and is therefore able to represent plane deformations of these cross-sections. Algorithms are proposed to solve the global nonlinear problem using an implicit scheme, under quasi-static assumptions. Simulation results of the tightening and releasing of knots made on monofilament and multifilament yarns are shown as an application. Straight fibers are first twisted together to make a yarn, before suitable conditions are applied to their ends to form and tighten the knot. Tightening forces are finally released to obtain an equilibrium configuration of the knot without external forces...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{aerospace}} industry has high quality requirements for fabrication, and critically monitors manufacturing processes {{as well as}} inspecting components and <b>assemblies.</b> Electron <b>beam</b> welding is used in {{an increasing number of}} quality critical applications because of its inherent advantages over other processes especially for titanium. Ensuring the beam quality is maintained for such applications requires probing of the electron beam itself, and not just monitoring of process parameters. This paper gives an overview of the development of a novel two-slit beam probing system that is simpler in design and can be used for high power welding applications. It has been found that within the EB gun itself, small changes can produce large enough variations in beam characteristics to give unpredictable welding or processing performance. Precise monitoring of these beam qualities is required to improve quality assurance, enable the transfer of processing between EB machines and to ensure accurate assessment of new production equipment...|$|R
