5000|$|Huntington's early {{economic}} base was <b>agriculture</b> <b>and</b> <b>stockraising.</b> Alfalfa seed {{was an important}} cash crop around {{the start of the}} 20th century, and honey produced by local apiarist Christian Ottesen won first prize at the St. Louis World's Fair in 1903. For most of its history, however, Huntington has drawn its main income from coal mining. Small [...] "wagon mines" [...] in Huntington Canyon provided limited employment. The coal camp of Mohrland, 8 mi to the north, active from about 1909 to 1938, was virtually an extension of Huntington, with many residents dividing the year between the mine and the farm. With the coming of better highways in the 1940s and 1950s, many miners commuted daily from Huntington to Hiawatha and other Carbon County mines.|$|E
50|$|The {{territory}} offers extremely interesting {{evidence for}} prehistory. The oldest archaeological discoveries {{date to the}} Chalcolithic period (4000 BC), and were discovered in the area called Pietra Rossa, {{where there is a}} necropolis containing dozens of skeletons in the fetal position, with large amounts of coarse pottery as grave goods - indicating a population focussed on <b>agriculture</b> <b>and</b> <b>stockraising.</b> Another archaeological site near Raffadali is Cozzo Busonè, located by the SS.118. This necropolis consists of several tombs in an artificial cave; 12 of these were destroyed by quarrying to produce lime. The archaeologist Bianchini was the first to conduct excavations on the site and to discover the existence of the tombs, which range from simple niches for a single individual to entire circular rooms for whole families. The pottery and stone objects are characteristic of the Castelluccio Culture (1800-1400 BC). Among the most significant discoveries are two female figurines, the so-called Venus figurines of Businè. There are also traces of a prehistoric necropolis near , with some bones cemented inside a thick crystalline structure.|$|E

50|$|In 1859, Gano {{moved his}} family to Grapevine Prairie, Texas, in {{northeast}} Tarrant County (roughly on the present site of the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport), and began farming <b>and</b> <b>stockraising,</b> as well as continuing to practice medicine. He was particularly interested in introducing Kentucky race horse breeds to Texas. He was soon involved in community efforts to pursue Comanche raiding parties, and was presented a sword for his efforts by local citizens. In 1860, {{he was elected to}} the Texas legislature from Tarrant County, where he was active in debates on frontier defense and agricultural issues.|$|R
50|$|The 1911 California Blue Book {{lists the}} major crops as Bartlett pears and beans. Other crops include grain, alfalfa, hay, prunes, peaches, apples, grapes <b>and</b> walnuts. <b>Stockraising</b> {{included}} goats, hogs, turkeys and dairying.|$|R
5000|$|Signs of Neolithic culture, and the {{transition}} from foraging and hunting to <b>agriculture</b> <b>and</b> <b>stockraising,</b> are found in Georgia from at least {{the beginning of the}} 6th millennium BC. The so-called early Neolithic sites are chiefly found in western Georgia. These are Khutsubani, Anaseuli, Kistriki, Kobuleti, Tetramitsa, Apiancha, Makhvilauri, Kotias Klde, Paluri and others. In the 5th millennium BC, the Kura (Mtkvari) basin also became stably populated, and settlements such as those at Tsopi, Aruchlo, and Sadakhlo along the Kura in eastern Georgia are distinguished by a long lasting cultural tradition, distinctive architecture, and considerable skill in stoneworking. Most of these sites relate to the flourishing late Neolithic/Eneolithic archaeological complex known as the Shulaveri-Shomu culture. Radiocarbon dating at Shulaveri sites indicates that the earliest settlements there date from the late sixth − early fifth millennium BC. In the highlands of eastern Anatolia and South Caucasus, the right combination of domesticable animals and sowable grains and legumes made possible the earliest agriculture. In this sense, the region can justly be considered one of the [...] "cradles of civilization".|$|E
