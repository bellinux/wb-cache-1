The author provides a background on the estimate of the situation as a process and in individual, group, and organizational decision making. An information-processing model for an organization demonstrates the need for a match between information-processing requirements and capabilities. Information processing requirements include factors from technology, inter-unit dependence, and the environment. Information capabilities consist of unit structure and integrating mechanisms. As the information-processing requirements approach a high level of uncertainty, the capabilities must match. The <b>appropriate</b> <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedure</b> to use varies with the change in uncertainty. The estimate of the situation procedure works well in highly uncertain situations but is very time intensive. Alternate methods can accommodate reduced uncertainty or reduced time available. Evaluations of staffs may not consider the context or situation in which the staff operates. The situational factors incorporated in a staff evaluation are useful in an accurate assessment.

40|$|In this article, we {{consider}} different perspectives {{on who is}} best able to provide relevant and helpful expertise in public law cases where the long-term care of children is under consideration. Opinions vary and sometimes conflict on the respective importance of legal, child development, and lay understandings. These opinions relate to views on rights, <b>appropriate</b> <b>procedures,</b> <b>decision-making</b> processes, {{and the effects of}} decisions on children. Firstly, we summarise literature relevant to the knowledge and skills of three key groups of decision-makers within the Scottish child care system: legal professionals, child care professionals and lay decision-makers, and outline literature about guardiansad litemand their counterparts. We then discuss issues of expertise emerging from a study exploring the reasons for, and impact of, the appointment of safeguarders (who, in Scotland, perform a similar role to guardians). We conclude that there may be an increasing tendency for disagreement and a lack of clarity about who brings the most relevant and helpful expertise to hearings; this may have negative effects for children...|$|R

40|$|Spatial <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedures,</b> such as multi-criteria {{evaluation}} (MCE), often {{rely upon}} input data derived from remote sensing {{in the form}} of land cover maps. However, these data can often contain inherent errors and misclassifications that can influence the accuracy of the final output associated with spatial <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedures.</b> The research presented here explores what influence errors and misclassifications in remote sensing derived land cover data can have on the output from spatial <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedures.</b> Four land cover data layers, each covering the same spatial area and easily obtained from scholarly or governmental institutions, are used throughout this research. These comparative land cover data layers are compared with an author-created land cover data layer known as the BASE layer. The BASE layer represents the nearest approximation of the land cover condition in the study region. Overall land cover classification accuracy is assessed for each of the land cover data layers used in this research. In addition to overall land cover classification accuracy, classification accuracy is evaluated along the edge and interior of land cover regions in order to determine if the spatial location of errors and misclassifications, rather than the quantity of errors and misclassifications alone, can {{have an impact on the}} output form spatial decision making procedures. This is followed by an assessment of the influence of errors and misclassifications on site and situational factors, two of the primary components of spatial <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedures.</b> Direct comparisons are made between the BASE layer and the comparative land cover data layers. A series of multi-criteria evaluation procedures using the BASE layer and the four comparative data layers as input concludes this research. The output from the spatial <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedure</b> using the BASE layer is directly compared with the same spatial <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedure</b> using each of the comparative land cover data layers as input. Differences between the BASE layer and the comparative land cover data layers are then assessed to determine if errors and misclassifications have had an impact on the output of the spatial <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedures.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Policy-making {{has become}} a central {{practice}} of Western society as policies themselves become a fundamental part of neoliberal governance. This thesis argues that {{paying attention to the}} moralities which generate policy-making practices is an important focus for the anthropology of policy. Using Bourdieuʼs (1980 : 12) Practice Theory, which argues that “the social world is made and remade through the actions of people,” I explore {{the ways in which the}} Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealandʼs policy-making practices reproduce their Charter Principle of <b>Appropriate</b> <b>Decision-Making.</b> By examining the work of the Policy Committee, the Party membership, and Caucus in the policy-making process, I argue that balancing the four principles of what I have called Green decision-making – consensus, democracy, congruence, and electoral safety – are part of the moral project of enacting the Charter Principle of <b>Appropriate</b> <b>Decision-Making.</b> Making sense of the Greensʼ policy-making shows that their practices generate and are generated by the doxa of the moral Principle of <b>Appropriate</b> <b>Decision-Making.</b> Working from the level of practice and foregrounding moralities is important for the anthropology of policy because they offer additional entry points for understanding the work of policymakers, the meanings which constitute their social worlds, and their policies...|$|R

40|$|According to the neo-corporatist {{approach}} to the “problem of compliance,” worker control over union policy is incompatible with centralized wage regulation, because only associations in which national leaders are insulated from their members are capable of delivering rank-and-file acceptance of wage moderation. This analysis of centralized collective bargaining agreements in Italy in the 1980 s and 1990 s provides a critical re-examination of the traditional neo-corporatist approach. The author, drawing on archival research and interviews, argues that centralization can be entirely compatible with <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedures</b> in which rank-and-file workers have ultimate decision-making power. In fact, the Italian labor movement's adoption of more “democratic” <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedures,</b> he claims, was instrumental in generating and sustaining centralized collective bargaining arrangements in Italy in the early 1990 s...|$|R

Crisis outcomes were rated by outside experts {{in terms of their}} effect on U. S. vital interests and on international conflict. Results indicated that crisis outcomes tended to have more adverse effects on U. S. interests and were more likely to increase international conflict when the decision-making process was characterized by a large number of symptoms. Alternative explanations are considered and the implications of these results for improving decision makers' procedures are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} investigated {{the relation between}} autonomy (i. e., freedom of choice) and procedural justice. Three studies tested the hypothesis that people would be particularly sensitive to the fairness of <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedures</b> when they experience deprivation of autonomy needs. Study 1 indicated that procedural justice judgments indeed were influenced more strongly by variations in <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedures</b> among participants who experienced little autonomy in their life. In Study 2, these findings were conceptually replicated by manipulating whether participants were provided with choice {{on an issue that}} was unrelated to the outcomes of the subsequent decision-making process. Study 3 revealed evidence for the hypothesis in a field setting. It is concluded that procedural justice is functional to regulate basic autonomy needs. © 2009 American Psychological Association...|$|R

Results suggested that CPs exhibit considerable variation in membership criteria, unclear <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedures,</b> and have uncertain representative structures.
