On a geological timescale, the meandering channel was more prone to reworking. During meandering channel evolution, the direction of diverging thalweg trajectories indicated that the upstream bar was subjected to powerful erosion, whereas the downstream bar experienced expansion, translation, or rotation.|$|R
