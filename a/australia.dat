40|$|The {{termination}} of <b>Australia's</b> Domestic Market Support scheme for manufacturing milk producers {{and the end}} of state market milk (fluid milk) pricing regulations on June 30, 2000 made <b>Australia's</b> dairy industry arguably the most deregulated in the world. <b>Australia's</b> milk production will become concentrated on larger farms in low-cost milk production areas as a result of deregulation. Deregulation is expected to enhance <b>Australia's</b> competitiveness in dairy export markets. Valuable lessons for the dairy industries of the U. S., EU, and other countries can be gained from analyzing the forces that caused <b>Australia's</b> dairy industry to deregulate. Of interest too is the restructuring package that <b>Australia's</b> dairy industry and <b>Australia's</b> government used to help milk producers adjust to the lower milk prices and lower farm asset values that accompany deregulation. <b>Australia's</b> Domestic Market Support Scheme, <b>Australia's</b> Milk Production, Deregulation, Agribusiness, Demand and Price Analysis, Farm Management, Industrial Organization, International Development, Risk and Uncertainty,...|$|R

Some commentators have criticised the evolutionary approach adopted by the court, and the court's resultant failure to find a certain date on which <b>Australia</b> became independent, arguing that the distinction is more than merely symbolic and could have real consequences. However, even Justice Callinan, who questioned the evolutionary approach in this case, affirmed in a later case (Attorney-General Western <b>Australia</b> v Marquet) that the effect of the <b>Australia</b> Act in finally recognising independence could not be doubted.|$|E

Unlike Canada, <b>Australia</b> was not a party to the Quebec Agreement or its successor, the 1948 Modus Vivendi, and Britain would not share technical information with <b>Australia</b> for fear that it might jeopardise its far more important relationship with the United States.
