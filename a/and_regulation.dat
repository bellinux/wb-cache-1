5|$|In the 35 {{years between}} the time of Chandler's {{reorganization}} and the election of Wendell H. Ford as governor in 1971, the executive branch had again become unwieldy. 60 departments and 210 boards reported directly to the governor by 1972, and duplication of services between departments had created inefficiencies. On January 1, 1973, a plan that Ford had issued in late 1972 took effect, consolidating the departments reporting to him into six program cabinets: Consumer Protection <b>and</b> <b>Regulation,</b> Development, Education and the Arts, Human Resources, Safety and Justice, and Transportation. Ford continued merging departments and reorganizing the executive branch throughout 1973 to the extent that, {{by the end of}} the year, there were only three program cabinets (Development, Education and the Arts, and Consumer Protection <b>and</b> <b>Regulation)</b> and four additional departments (Human Resources, Justice, Natural Resources and Environmental Protection, and Transportation).|$|E

5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{molecular}} cues involved in the correct targeting of the migrating precursors remains a question. The secretion of a chemoattractant factor by the OB appears as a possibility. Chemoattractants and repellants act on the migrating neurons by inducing changes in the growth cone to direct them. Nevertheless, tissue derived from this structure had no directive influence on the migration. On the other hand, a septum-derived secreted factor showed a repulsive effect on the SVZ cells. More recently, {{it has been shown}} that the secreted molecule SLIT shows such a repelling effect on SVZ-derived precursors. Furthermore, integrins have been demonstrated to have a regulatory influence on precursor cell chain-migration <b>and</b> <b>regulation</b> of their divisions.|$|E
5|$|Abortion is the {{intentional}} termination of pregnancy, {{as compared to}} spontaneous termination (miscarriage). Abortion is closely allied to contraception in terms of women's control <b>and</b> <b>regulation</b> of their reproduction, and is often subject to similar cultural, religious, legislative and economic constraints. Where access to contraception is limited, women turn to abortion. Consequently, abortion rates {{may be used to}} estimate unmet needs for contraception. However the available procedures have carried great risk for women throughout most of history, and still do in the developing world, or where legal restrictions force women to seek clandestine facilities. Access to safe legal abortion places undue burdens on lower socioeconomic groups and in jurisdictions that create significant barriers. These issues have frequently been the subject of political and feminist campaigns where differing viewpoints pit health against moral values.|$|E

Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics. Widespread state intervention <b>and</b> <b>regulation</b> largely walled the economy off from the outside world.

He was considered less ruthless than previous governors in firing state officials hired by the previous administration, and expanded the state merit system to cover some previously exempt state workers.
