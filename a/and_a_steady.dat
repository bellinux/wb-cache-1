5|$|The {{biological}} and geological future of Earth can be extrapolated {{based upon the}} estimated effects of several long-term influences. These include the chemistry at Earth's surface, the rate of cooling of the planet's interior, the gravitational interactions with other objects in the Solar System, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> increase in the Sun's luminosity. An uncertain factor in this extrapolation is the ongoing influence of technology introduced by humans, such as climate engineering, which could cause significant changes to the planet. The current Holocene extinction is being caused by technology and the effects may last {{for up to five}} million years. In turn, technology may result in the extinction of humanity, leaving the planet to gradually return to a slower evolutionary pace resulting solely from long-term natural processes.|$|E
5|$|The {{major part}} of the {{subsequent}} attenuated expedition was a three-month cruise to the eastern Antarctic, under the leadership of the party's second-in-command, Frank Wild. The shortcomings of Quest were soon in evidence: slow speed, heavy fuel consumption, a tendency to roll in heavy seas, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> leak. The ship was unable to proceed further than longitude 20°E, well short of its easterly target, and its engine's low power coupled with its unsuitable bows was insufficient for it to penetrate southward through the pack ice. Following several fruitless attempts, Wild returned the ship to South Georgia, on the way visiting Elephant Island where he and 21 others had been stranded after the sinking of the ship Endurance, during Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition six years earlier.|$|E

25|$|The {{film was}} a {{commercial}} failure, grossing $11.1million in North America, below its estimated $19 to $25 million budget. It received mixed reviews that left Carpenter disillusioned with Hollywood and influenced {{his decision to}} return to independent filmmaking. It has since become a cult classic and has an 82% average rating on Rotten Tomatoes <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> audience on home video.|$|E
25|$|Jefferson {{strongly}} opposed having any national debt, but he relented in 1803 {{for the sake}} of the Louisiana Purchase. James Madison and James Monroe were elected by the Democratic-Republican Party, but after the fiscal disasters of the War of 1812, they came to support most Federalist positions and decided that the nation needed a central bank <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> income flow from tariffs.|$|E
25|$|Estimates on the {{membership}} of the CGT differ greatly. The union itself claimed a membership of about 150,000 from 1919 to 1922 <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> decrease to 50,000 by 1927. Other estimates claim {{the membership}} never even exceeded 100,000 and even shrank to 80,000 by 1922. The membership is considerable nonetheless as Portugal boasted only a few hundred thousand industrial workers and artisans at the time.|$|E

Deformable solid mirrors use flexible mirrors with complex actuators underneath to correct for atmospheric distortion <b>and</b> keep <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> focus. [...] Shortcomings of traditional deformable solid mirrors include cost, fragility, {{and the need for}} continuous power. In addition, images from these mirrors have an undesirable quilt pattern due to the discrete actuators beneath the mirror surface.|$|R

25|$|The federal government's growth {{during and}} after World War II spurred rapid growth in the county and made the county {{increasingly}} suburban. Other large businesses continued to settle in Fairfax County {{and the opening of}} Tysons Corner Center spurred the rise of Tysons Corner. The technology boom <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> government-driven economy also created rapid growth and an increasingly growing and diverse population. The economy has also made Fairfax County one of the nation's wealthiest counties.|$|E

McLaren fitted his engine into the team spare car, thus saving Montoya from a 10-place grid penalty. He managed to qualify in seventh place ahead of Räikkönen. The race however was very undramatic for him <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> performance saw him finish third, earning his first podium finish of the season.|$|E

25|$|The 20th century brought {{profound}} changes to St. Augustine including {{a substantial increase}} in population <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> rise in winter visitors – many of whom chose Trinity as their church. The Reverend L. Fitz-James Hindry served as Rector from 1904 until 1936. His tenure saw the formation of many lay organizations - the Altar Guild, Daughters of the king, St. Catherine’s Guild, and others – all devoted to working with the church on a variety of projects.|$|E
25|$|Greenwood Furnace State Park {{is named}} for the iron furnace that was once the center of {{industry}} in northern Huntingdon County. Greenwood Furnace was open for operation on June 5, 1834. The parent company, Norris, Rawle and Co., selected the site because of the ease in access to the needed natural resources, iron ore, limestone, trees for charcoal <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> water supply. Greenwood Furnace was able to produce up to five tons of pig iron ingots per day {{at the height of}} its production.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy of}} Hillsboro, {{like so many}} other small, rural towns in North Dakota, is heavily {{dependent}} on agriculture. When local farmers have a bad harvest, the Hillsboro economy can also suffer. In turn, when the harvest is good, Hillsboro usually prospers. One of the more obvious effects the agricultural community has had on Hillsboro is found at the American Crystal Sugar sugar beet plant directly north of town. The large plant, located on U.S. Highway 81, has been responsible for both an increase in population <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> stream of available jobs during the last few decades that it has been open.|$|E

25|$|UV water {{treatment}} devices {{can be used}} for well water and surface water disinfection. UV treatment compares favorably with other water disinfection systems in terms of cost, labor, and the need for technically trained personnel for operation. Water chlorination treats larger organisms and offers residual disinfection, but these systems are expensive because they need special operator training <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> supply of a potentially hazardous material. Finally, boiling of water is the most reliable treatment method but it demands labor, and imposes a high economic cost. UV treatment is rapid and, in terms of primary energy use, approximately 20,000 times more efficient than boiling.|$|E
25|$|The {{demand for}} the {{products}} manufactured in the Jewellery Quarter peaked in 1920 <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> decline started. The Quarter was hard hit by the Great Depression and struggled to recover after. Some companies constructed large factories {{as they tried to}} diversify their businesses. In World War II, manufacture turned again to munitions and this led to the Jewellery Quarter becoming a target of bombing raids by the Luftwaffe in the Birmingham Blitz. Like the rest of Birmingham, this brought a lot of damage to the Jewellery Quarter. St Paul's Church was damaged and was repaired between 1949 and 1951 to a design by J. B. Surman. In November 1940, Thomas Walker plc's 1934 factory in St Paul's Square was destroyed but rebuilt 18 months later.|$|E
25|$|Classical sources {{indicate}} that the trireme was capable of sustained speeds of ca. 6 knots at a relatively leisurely pace. There is also a reference by Xenophon of a single day's voyage from Byzantium to Heraclea Pontica, which translates as an average speed of 7.37 knots. These figures seem to be corroborated by the tests conducted with the reconstructed Olympias: a maximum speed of 8 knots <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> speed of 4 knots could be maintained, with half the crew resting at a time. Given the imperfect nature of the reconstructed ship {{as well as the}} fact that it was manned by totally untrained modern men and women, it is reasonable to suggest that ancient triremes, expertly built and navigated by trained men, would attain higher speeds.|$|E

25|$|The {{missions}} {{have earned}} {{a prominent place}} in California's historic consciousness, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> stream of tourists {{from all over the}} world visit them. In recognition of that fact, on November 30, 2004 President George W. Bush signed HR 1446, the California Mission Preservation Act, into law. The measure provided $10 million over a five-year period to the California Missions Foundation for projects related to the physical preservation of the missions, including structural rehabilitation, stabilization, and conservation of mission art and artifacts. The California Missions Foundation, a volunteer, tax-exempt organization, was founded in 1998 by Richard Ameil, an eighth generation Californian. A change to the California Constitution has also been proposed that would allow the use of State funds in restoration efforts.|$|E

Around mile 38, a group of six began what would become the final run to the City, including Belizean hopefuls Jose Choto and Giovanni Leslie. However, Mexicans Carlos Lopez and Carlos Manuel Hernandez left the pack around mile 12 and sprinted 1-2 to the Memorial Park, with Cuba's Frank Travieso taking third. Lopez became the first Mexican to win since 2002 and only the third overall. Belize's run of futility was extended to four years.|$|E
25|$|Ybor City {{grew and}} flourished from the 1890s until the Great Depression of the 1930s, when {{a drop in}} demand for fine cigars {{reduced the number of}} cigar {{factories}} and mechanization in the cigar industry greatly reduced employment opportunities in the neighborhood. This process accelerated after World War II, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> exodus of residents and businesses continued until large areas of the formerly vibrant neighborhood were virtually abandoned by the late 1970s. Attempts at redevelopment failed until the 1980s, when an influx of artists began a slow process of gentrification. In the 1990s and early 2000s, a portion of the original neighborhood around 7th Avenue developed into a night club and entertainment district, and many old buildings were renovated for new uses. Since then, the area's economy has diversified with more offices and residences, and the population has shown notable growth {{for the first time in}} over half a century.|$|E
