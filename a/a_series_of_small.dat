5|$|After 1529, {{resistance}} to John I in Transylvania was broken in <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> campaigns. For instance, the last Transylvanian magnate {{to side with}} Ferdinánd I, Stephen Majláth went over to John I in early 1532, and Sibiu was occupied in 1536. On February 24, 1538, a secret pact was signed in Oradea by {{the representatives of the}} two kings of Hungary. According to the treaty, both rulers were allowed to retain the territories which they then held, but the childless John I promised to recognize the Habsburgs' succession.|$|E

5|$|In his 1935 work Handbuch der systematischen Weichtierkunde (Handbook of Systematic Malacology), Johannes Thiele {{introduced}} a mollusc taxonomy {{based upon the}} 1909 work by Cossmann and Peyrot. Thiele's system divided the bivalves into three orders. Taxodonta consisted of forms that had taxodont dentition, with <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> parallel teeth perpendicular to the hinge line. Anisomyaria consisted of forms that had either a single adductor muscle or one adductor muscle {{much smaller than the}} other. Eulamellibranchiata consisted of forms with ctenidial gills. The Eulamellibranchiata was further divided into four suborders: Schizodonta, Heterodonta, Adapedonta and Anomalodesmata.|$|E

5|$|Seizing upon a new {{development}} to visualize particle tracks, created by Donald Glaser and known as a bubble chamber, Alvarez realized the device was just what was needed, if only it {{could be made to}} function with liquid hydrogen. Hydrogen nuclei, which are protons, made the simplest and most desirable target for interactions with the particles produced by the Bevatron. He began a development program to build <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> chambers, and championed the device to Ernest Lawrence.|$|E

The rhynes are often used as field boundary ditches instead of hedges. Some parts are allowed to flood in winter. The area is mainly used for grazing but some peat extraction is carried out.|$|E

5|$|Above the course, zones {{four and}} five, as {{identified}} by Cockerell, contain figures which represent the Christian Church in Britain, with the spiritual lords such as bishops, abbots, abbesses and saintly founders of monasteries on the south, while kings, queens and princes occupy the north. Many {{of the figures}} survive and many {{have been identified in}} the light of their various attributes. There is a hierarchy of size, with the more significant figures larger and enthroned in their niches rather than standing. Immediately beneath the upper course are <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> niches containing dynamic sculptures of the dead coming forth from their tombs on the Day of Judgement. Although naked, some of the dead are defined as royalty by their crowns and others as bishops by their mitres. Some emerge from their graves with joy and hope, and others with despair.|$|E

5|$|After {{publishing}} Prehistory of Scotland (1935), Childe produced one of {{the defining}} books of his career, Man Makes Himself (1936). Influenced by Marxist views of history, Childe argued that the usual distinction between (pre-literate) prehistory and (literate) history was a false dichotomy and that human society has progressed {{through a series of}} technological, economic and social revolutions. These included the Neolithic Revolution, when hunter-gatherers began settling in permanent farming communities, through to the Urban Revolution, when society progressed from <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> towns through to the first cities, and right up to more recent times, when the Industrial Revolution changed the nature of production.|$|E
5|$|During {{the evening}} of 22 August, a force of eight Fireflies and six bomb-armed Hellcats from Indefatigable raided Kaafjord again. This {{was the first in}} what was {{intended}} to be <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> harassing attacks conducted to wear down the German defences. German forces did not detect the aircraft before they arrived over Kaafjord at 7:10 pm, and the Fireflies' strafing attacks on German gun positions killed one member of Tirpitzs crew and wounded ten. However, the Hellcats' bombs failed to inflict any damage on the battleship. The British fighters also attacked German ships and radar stations on their return flight, damaging two tankers, a supply ship and a patrol boat. No British aircraft were lost during this raid.|$|E
5|$|Geologists {{classify}} {{the falls}} at Ricketts Glen State Park into two types. Wedding-cake falls descend in <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> steps, forming waterfalls that {{are said to}} resemble a wedding cake. Within the park, this type of falls usually flows over thin layers of Huntley Mountain Formation sandstone. In bridal-veil falls, the second type, water falls over a ledge and drops vertically into a plunge pool in the stream bed below. Within the park, this type of falls flows over Catskill Formation rocks or the red shale and sandstone of the Huntley Formation. In the park, the harder caprock which forms the ledge from which the bridal-veil falls drops is grey sandstone. The softer red shale below is eroded away by water, sand and gravel to form the plunge pool.|$|E

5|$|Little {{evidence}} of an occupation on the tell exists following {{the destruction of the}} Mitannian city, however, <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> villages existed in the lower town during the Assyrian periods. The remains of a Hellenistic settlement were discovered on a nearby satellite tell, to the northwestern edge of the main tell. However, excavations recovered no ceramics of the Parthian-Roman or Byzantine-Sasanian periods, although sherds dating to those periods are noted. In the middle of the first millennium AD, a fortified building was erected in the northeastern lower town. The building was dated by Antoine Poidebard to the Justinian era (sixth century AD), {{on the basis of its}} architecture. The last occupation period of the site was during the early Abbasid Caliphate's period, when a canal was built to provide the town with water from the nearby Jaghjagh River.|$|E
5|$|Now in {{the town}} of Junius, the route follows an {{alignment}} parallel to that of the Thruway as it passes south of a large housing development and by <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> lakes collectively known as Junius Ponds. NY318 continues on, passing through a mixture of forested areas and cultivated fields as it heads eastward through the town. Just past an intersection with Nine Foot Road (County Route108 or CR108), NY318 serves the Waterloo Premium Outlets, a large collection of outlet stores situated between NY318 and the Thruway. Past the outlet mall, the route continues through largely rural surroundings to the community of Stone Church Corner, where it briefly curves to the northeast before veering back to the east as it enters the town of Tyre.|$|E
5|$|On January 10, 1910, the Tanana Tribune {{was absorbed}} by the News-Miner. The owners of the Tribune {{received}} shares in the News-Miner (which were later bought back by Thompson), {{and one of the}} Tribune's owners received its printing plant, which was moved to Tacoma, Washington. In 1911, Thompson feared the declining state of the Fairbanks economy and decided to leave Alaska. He sold his shares in the company, but returned after several months absence and demanded the shares back. Los Bernard, who briefly served as the paper's publisher, returned the shares to Thompson, who resumed his role as publisher and editor. Thompson's return coincided with <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>small</b> gold discoveries at Livengood and Shushanna that boosted the Fairbanks economy, as gold-seekers bought supplies in the town.|$|E
