40|$|Several {{possible}} {{effects of}} heavy {{rain on the}} aerodynamic performance of an airplane and of heavy rain and associated atmospheric phenomena on the indications of flight instruments are briefly considered. It is concluded {{that the effects of}} heavy rain on the performance of an airplane are not so great as to force the airplane down from moderate altitudes. Serious malfunctioning of the <b>air-speed</b> <b>indicator</b> may occur, however, as a result of flooding of the pitot-static head and subsequent accumulation of water in the air-speed pressure line. In strong convective situations, like thunderstorms, the rate-of-climb indicator may also be seriously in error owing to rapid variations of atmospheric pressure when entering and emerging from the convection currents...|$|E
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{basis of calculation}} of pressure drop in tubing is reviewed briefly. The effect of pressure drop in connecting tubing upon the operation and indication of aircraft instruments is discussed. Approximate equations are developed, and charts and tables based upon them are presented for use in designing installations of altimeters, <b>air-speed</b> <b>indicators,</b> rate-of-climb indicators, and air-driven gyroscopic instruments...|$|R
40|$|This {{report was}} {{prepared}} for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics in order to supply the need of practical methods of reducing observed performance to standard conditions {{with a minimum of}} labor. The first part gives a very simple approximate method of reducing performance in climb, and is particularly adapted to work not requiring extreme accuracy. The second part gives a somewhat more elaborate and more accurate method which is well suited to general flight test reduction. The third part gives the conventional method of calibrating <b>air-speed</b> <b>indicators</b> and reducing the indicated speeds to true air speeds. An appendix gives working tables and charts for the standard atmosphere. (author) ...|$|R
