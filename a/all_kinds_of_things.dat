5|$|After {{breaking}} {{out from his}} prison, Brad falls into a moat before coming {{to a halt in}} a maze of an underground cavern. Reaching the surface, he arrives at a nearby village; this location is repeatedly revisited throughout the game, as Brad comes back there after traveling to the various corners of the land, encountering bizarre characters and experiencing absurd adventures: the Edge of the World cliff, the Ice Palace, and the Valley of the Lost (a place where <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> lost on Earth have gone to), all while searching for an unlikely set of items that would help him emerge victorious from the game's final showdown (including a fire extinguisher and a mechanical fan). In the end, the boy enters the evil Queen's castle to find and defeat her once and for all. Once she is no more, he gets instantly transported back to the baseball field where it all had started.|$|E
500|$|Assata Shakur {{was born}} Joanne Deborah Byron, in Flushing, Queens, New York City, on July 16, 1947. She lived {{for three years}} with her mother, school teacher Doris E. Johnson, and retired grandparents, Lula and Frank Hill. In 1950, Shakur's parents {{divorced}} and she moved with her grandparents to Wilmington, North Carolina. Shakur moved back to Queens {{with her mother and}} stepfather after elementary school, attending Parsons Junior High School. However, she still frequently visited her grandparents in the south. The family struggled financially, and argued frequently; Shakur spent little time at home. She often ran away, staying with strangers and working for short periods of time, until she was taken in by her mother's sister Evelyn A. Williams, a civil rights worker, who lived in Manhattan. She has said that her aunt was the heroine of her childhood, as she was constantly introducing her to new things. She said that her aunt was [...] "very sophisticated and knew <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> She was right up my alley because i [...] was forever asking all kinds of questions. I wanted to know everything." [...] Williams often took her to museums, theaters, and art galleries, and the conflicts that did rise between the two were typically due to Shakur's habit of lying.|$|E

Also, I felt the story needed to be told, I {{feel that this is}} going to be an important film." [...] Benjamin Wallfisch, an Emmy and Ivor Novello-nominated composer, composed music for the movie Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain. The film was slated to release in 2010 but the lack of response from the distributors delayed the release. On the 30th anniversary of the Bhopal Gas Disaster, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh attended the film's premiere in Bhopal and after watching the film he announced that the state government would not charge any tax on the film's earning. Chouhan called the film [...] "very sensitive" [...] and praised the [...] "heart-rending" [...] performance given by actors. To promote awareness about the tragedy a NGO The Bhopal Medical Appeal and the film's director collaborated with mobile commerce portal Paytm and the online shopping website Snapdeal. As part of the partnership Paytm and Snapdeal offered their customers a chance to donate money in form of online coupons to the disaster victims.|$|E

She previously headlined the festival on July 8, 2000, during the Oops!... I Did It Again World Tour, and had to cancel her performance during The Onyx Hotel Tour in 2004 due to a knee injury. Summerfest's entertainment director Bob Babisch said, [...] "It's {{going to be a great}} dance party. [...] This is going to be the biggest production we've ever put in the Marcus Amphitheatre.

Accompanied by two of her dancers— one translating in Spanish and the other in Portuguese— she also apologized for not touring in the region during The Circus Starring Britney Spears in 2009. A notice following the stream announced the first two dates in Brazil and ten more dates to be announced in the near future.

2500|$|The tort of {{nuisance}} {{allows a}} claimant (formerly plaintiff) {{to sue for}} most acts that interfere with their use and enjoyment of their land. A {{good example of this}} is in the case of Jones v Powell (1629). A brewery made stinking vapors waft to neighbours' property, damaging his papers. Because he was a landowner, the neighbour sued in nuisance for this damage. But Whitelocke J, speaking for the Court of the King's Bench, said that because the water supply was contaminated, it was better that the neighbour's documents were risked. He said [...] "it is better that they should be spoiled than that the common wealth stand in need of good liquor." [...] Nowadays, interfering with neighbours' property is not looked upon so kindly.

2500|$|Baggott got {{the idea}} to write Farewell to Reality and become a science activist when {{watching}} the BBC program What is Reality. In his opinion, the program started out well, but became what he calls [...] "fairy tale physics" [...] when it included interviews with theoretical physicists who talked about such ideas as multiverse, superstring theory, and supersymmetry. These topics, according to Baggott, are fascinating to read about and are an entertaining way to make documentaries, sell books, or spend time at parties, but are [...] "abstracted, theoretical speculation without any kind of empirical foundation" [...] and [...] "not science". Farewell to Reality is Baggott's attempt to counteract the [...] "fuzzy science theory" [...] and advocate for evidence and facts. Baggott states, [...] "When you start asking 'Do {{we live in a}} hologram?' Then you are crossing into metaphysics, and you are heading down the path of allowing <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that have no evidence to back it up, like creationism." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paranormal {{researcher}} John Champion {{writes in}} Skeptical Inquirer Magazine {{that he understands}} why people persist in believing that Queen Mary is haunted when the only evidence given is anecdotes, creepy feelings and shadows.

Champion believes that the owners are doing a disservice to the real history, the people who should be honoured [...] "by remembering who they really were and what they actually did". He understands why people report strange occurrences, the ship still creaks and groans, and people's imaginations can get away from them such that they start seeing and hearing <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> attributing them to the paranormal which they have been primed for.

2500|$|Neuro-linguistic {{programming}} (NLP) is {{an approach}} to communication, personal development, and psychotherapy created by Richard Bandler and John Grinder in California, United States in the 1970s. NLP's creators claim {{there is a connection}} between neurological processes (neuro-), language (linguistic) and behavioral patterns learned through experience (programming), and that these can be changed to achieve specific goals in life. Bandler and Grinder also claim that NLP methodology can [...] "model" [...] the skills of exceptional people, allowing anyone to acquire those skills. They claim as well that, often in a single session, NLP can treat problems such as phobias, depression, tic disorders, psychosomatic illnesses, near-sightedness, GINA: [...] I have seen you demonstrate a technique that some people refer to as Dr. Bandler's Beauty treatment?
