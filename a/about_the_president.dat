5|$|Writer and {{producer}} Bob Gale conceived the idea after he visited {{his parents in}} St. Louis, Missouri {{after the release of}} Used Cars. Searching their basement, Gale found his father's high school yearbook and discovered he was president of his graduating class. Gale thought <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> of his own graduating class, who was someone {{he had nothing to do}} with. Gale wondered whether he would have been friends with his father if they went to high school together. When he returned to California, he told Robert Zemeckis his new concept. Zemeckis subsequently thought of a mother claiming she never kissed a boy at school when, in fact, she was highly promiscuous. The two took the project to Columbia Pictures, and made a development deal for a script in September 1980.|$|E

25|$|Social {{networking}} {{sites have}} created issues among getting hired {{for jobs and}} losing jobs because of exposing inappropriate content, posting photos of embarrassing situations or posting comments that contain potentially offensive comments (e.g., racist, homophobic or defamatory comments), or even political comments that are contrary {{to those of the}} employer. There are works which recommend friends to social networking users based on their political opinions. Many people use social networking sites to express their personal opinions about current events and news issues to their friends. If a potential applicant expresses personal opinions on political issues or makes potentially embarrassing posts online on a publicly available social networking platform, employers can access their employees' and applicants' profiles, and judge them based on their social behavior or political views. According to Silicon Republic's statistics, 17,000 young people in six countries were interviewed in a survey. 1 in 10 people aged 16 to 34 have been rejected for a job because of comments made on an online profile. This shows the effects that social networks have had on people's lives. There have been numerous cases where employees have lost jobs because their opinions represented their companies negatively. In September 2013, a woman got fired over Facebook because she posted disruptive information about her company stating that military patrons should not receive special treatment or discounts. A manager of the company found her opinion online, disagreed with it, and fired her because it went against the company's mission statement. In November 2012, a woman posted a racist remark <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> of the United States and mentioned a possible assassination. She lost her job, and was put under investigation by the Secret Service.|$|E

500|$|Eleanor Roosevelt {{objected to}} the casting of Lionel Barrymore as her late husband, due to {{political}} remarks that Barrymore had made <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> in 1944. Marx delayed Barrymore's scenes while she {{had a chance to}} read and respond to a letter Barrymore sent her explaining that his remarks had been misinterpreted, but she was not placated, and Barrymore was replaced in the role by Godfrey Tearle. The War Department and the White House reviewed the script, and both asked for changes. The Army had objected to a scene in which an Army major made a pass at a girl and it was cut from the film, as the Army felt that this was poor conduct for an officer.|$|E
500|$|Carpenter {{originally}} {{wrote the}} screenplay for Escape from New York in 1976, {{in the aftermath}} of the Watergate scandal. Carpenter said, [...] "The whole feeling of the nation was one of real cynicism <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>President.</b> I wrote the screenplay and no studio wanted to make it" [...] because, according to Carpenter, [...] "it was too violent, too scary, too weird." [...] He had been inspired by the film Death Wish, which was very popular at the time. He did not agree with this film's philosophy but liked how it conveyed [...] "the sense of New York as a kind of jungle, and I wanted to make a science fiction film along these lines".|$|E

2500|$|Johnson’s {{first visit}} to Turkey as Foreign Secretary was {{somewhat}} tense due to his having won Douglas Murray’s poetry competition <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, four months earlier.

2500|$|Facing up to 3.5 {{years in}} {{military}} prison and dismissal from the Army, on December 15 Lakin changed tack {{and stated that}} he was wrong to question the president's qualifications through his military service.

[...] The defense brought witnesses before the court to testify on Lakin's behalf, describing the accused as a [...] "compassionate physician" [...] who always volunteered to help when needed. [...] The prosecution introduced the officer that was deployed in Lakin's stead, who testified alongside his wife about how the last-minute deployment affected their lives.|$|E
2500|$|The East Room has {{appeared}} {{in a number of}} motion pictures <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> of the United States. It {{is one of the most}} commonly-depicted spaces in the White House, along with the Entrance Hall, Cross Hall, and West Sitting Hall. Accuracy in its depiction has generally been good. One outstanding example is the 1944 biographical picture Wilson, which was extremely accurate (even down to the style of paneling). The film's art director Wiard Ihnen and set decorator Thomas Little won an Academy Award for their work on the film. [...] Many recent films have used Zuber wallpaper to depict the East Room—the same wallpaper purchased by Jacqueline Kennedy during the East Room's 1963 redecoration. President Bill Clinton gave the producers of the 1995 film The American President extensive access to the White House, which allowed them to create a superb replica of the East Room as well. Far less successful was the 2005 television series Commander in Chief, which depicted the East Room as a kind of shabby hotel lobby.|$|E

6000|$|It {{has been}} snowing all night, {{and the city}} is in a miserable condition. We had a fine house last night for [...] "Carol" [...] and [...] "Trial," [...] and such an {{enthusiastic}} one that they persisted in a call after the [...] "Carol," [...] and, while I was out, covered the little table with flowers. The [...] "True American" [...] has taken a fresh start, {{as if it were}} quite a novelty, and is on the whole rather worse than ever to-day. The Cunard packet, the Australasian (a poor ship), is some days overdue, and Dolby is anxiously looking out for her. There is a lull in the excitement <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> but the articles of impeachment are to be produced this afternoon, and then it may set in again. Osgood came into camp last night from selling in remote places, and reports that at Rochester and Buffalo (both places near the frontier), Canada people bought tickets, who had struggled across the frozen river and clambered over all sorts of obstructions to get them. Some of those halls turn out to be smaller than represented, but I have no doubt, to use an American expression, that we shall [...] "get along." ...|$|E
6000|$|All I am {{concerned}} to consider {{here is the}} inevitable failure {{of this sort of}} Anglo-American propaganda to create a friendship. To praise Lincoln as an Englishman is about as appropriate as if we were praising Lincoln as an English town. We are talking about something totally different. And indeed the whole conversation is rather like some such cross-purposes about some such word as 'Lincoln'; in which one party should be talking <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> and the other about the cathedral. It is like some wild bewilderment in a farce, with one man wondering how a President could have a church-spire, and the other wondering how a church could have a chin-beard. And the moral is the moral on which I would insist everywhere in this book; that the remedy {{is to be found in}} disentangling the two and not in entangling them further. You could not produce a democrat of the logical type of Lincoln merely out of the moral materials that now make up an English cathedral town, like that on which Old Tom of Lincoln looks down. But on the other hand, it is quite certain that a hundred Abraham Lincolns, working for a hundred years, could not build Lincoln Cathedral. And the farcical allegory of an attempt to make Old Tom and Old Abe embrace to the glory of the illogical Anglo-Saxon language is but a symbol of something that is always being attempted, and always attempted in vain. It is not by mutual imitation that the understanding can come. It is not by erecting New York sky-scrapers in London that New York can learn the sacred significance of the towers of Lincoln. It is not by English dukes importing the daughters of American millionaires that England can get any glimpse of the democratic dignity of American men. I have the best of all reasons for knowing that a stranger can be welcomed in America; and just as he is courteously treated in the country as a stranger, so he should always be careful to treat it as a strange land. That sort of imaginative respect, as for something different and even distant, is the only beginning of any attachment between patriotic peoples. The English traveller may carry with him at least one word of his own great language and literature; and whenever he is inclined to say of anything 'This is passing strange,' he may remember that it was no inconsiderable Englishman who appended to it the answer, 'And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.' ...|$|E
