5|$|Classifying {{aluminium}} as a metalloid {{has been}} disputed given its many metallic properties. It is therefore, arguably, <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> the mnemonic that elements {{adjacent to the}} metal–nonmetal dividing line are metalloids.|$|E
5|$|N. tazetta and its cultivars are <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> this rule, {{requiring}} no cold period. Often {{harvested in}} October, bulbs are lifted in May and dried and heated to 30°C for three weeks, then stored at 25°C for 12 weeks and planted. Flowering can be delayed by storing at 5°C–10°C.|$|E
5|$|Pest species adapt {{readily to}} a variety of environments, but prefer warm {{conditions}} found within buildings. Many tropical species prefer even warmer environments. Cockroaches are mainly nocturnal and run away when exposed to light. <b>An</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> this is the Asian cockroach, which flies mostly at night but is attracted to brightly-lit surfaces and pale colors.|$|E

5|$|An error as to a jurisdictional, or precedent, fact is <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> {{the general}} rule that the High Court does not judicially review errors of fact. Under the {{threefold}} classification of the broad grounds of judicial review set out in Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service ("the GCHQ case", 1983) – illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety – an error as to a precedent fact may {{be regarded as a}} form of illegality.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> {{this rule}} occurs during medal {{presentation}} ceremonies at multi-sport {{events such as}} the Olympics and Asian Games. As Hong Kong competes separately from mainland China, should an athlete from Hong Kong win the gold medal, and an athlete from mainland China win the silver and/or bronze medal(s) in the same event, the regional flag of Hong Kong would be raised in the centre above the national flag(s) during the medal presentation ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Endpoints {{are grouped}} into {{interfaces}} and each interface {{is associated with}} a single device function. <b>An</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> this is endpoint zero, which is used for device configuration and is not associated with any interface. A single device function composed of independently controlled interfaces is called a composite device. A composite device only has a single device address because the host only assigns a device address to a function.|$|E

5|$|Escape From Butcher Bay {{received}} critical acclaim. Certain reviewers {{preferred the}} game over its film counterpart, and considered it <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> the general mediocrity of film tie-in games. The Xbox {{version of the}} game sold 159,000 copies in August 2004, and was among the best-selling games on any platform during June 2004; it was later re-released as a Platinum Hits title. Conversely, the PC version sold 32,500 after six months on shelves.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009, Yao {{discussed}} the injury with his doctors, and the Rockets {{applied for a}} disabled player exception, <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> the NBA Salary Cap which grants the injured player's team money to sign a free agent. The Rockets were granted the exception, and used approximately $5.7million on free agent Trevor Ariza. After weeks of consulting, {{it was decided that}} Yao would undergo surgery in order to repair the broken bone in his left foot. He did not play the entire 2009–10 season.|$|E
5|$|In each of {{the cases}} above, the actual score is irrelevant; the {{projectiles}} simply have to hit the target sheet within the circles.

5|$|The Court {{ruled that}} the first two {{requirements}} had been satisfied, and that the guideline had not been rigidly enforced because the PSA {{had been willing to}} consider representations from cruise operators like the plaintiff, and, if the circumstances required, the PSA had been willing to grant <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> the 30% restriction rule. Moreover, a number of concessions had in fact been made by the PSA.|$|E
5|$|The Thanhouser Company {{produced}} a 1912 film version, directed by Lucius Henderson and starring James Cruze. The one-reel film, based on Sullivan's play, may be <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> {{the custom of}} one actor playing Jekyll and Hyde. Although Cruze was credited with a dual role, Harry Benham (who played the father of Jekyll's fiancée), said in 1963 that he had played Hyde in some scenes.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagonal}} {{positioning of}} the metalloids represents <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> the observation that elements with similar properties tend to occur in vertical groups. A related effect {{can be seen in}} other diagonal similarities between some elements and their lower right neighbours, specifically lithium-magnesium, beryllium-aluminium, and boron-silicon. Rayner-Canham has argued that these similarities extend to carbon-phosphorus, nitrogen-sulfur, and into three d-block series.|$|E

5|$|Today all {{cardinals}} {{are required}} to be bishops, but priests named cardinal at an advanced age often petition the Pope for <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> this rule. Bruno Heim says that since the cross is one heraldic emblem that only bishops {{have the right to}} bear, cardinals who are not bishops do not use it. Notable examples are Cardinals Albert Vanhoye and Avery Dulles; the latter's arms do display a cross.|$|E
5|$|After {{his escape}} from Detroit, Hines went to Toronto where several other former Confederates lived. Not expecting {{to return to}} the United States, he sent for his wife Nancy. While in Toronto he studied law with General John C. Breckinridge, a former Vice President of the United States. Once U.S. President Andrew Johnson {{declared}} a pardon for most former Confederates, Hines went back to Detroit on July 20, 1865, to sign a loyalty oath to the United States. However, knowing that Union officials in Kentucky would consider him <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> the pardon, he remained in Canada until May 1866.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> all of {{this would}} be the Primal Zerg, who inhabit the {{original}} Zerg homeworld of Zerus (as seen in Heart of the Swarm). The Zerg Hive Mind was created to control the Zerg, and eventually put them {{under the control of the}} main antagonist of the series, the fallen Xel'Naga Amon. Some Zerg, however, managed to avoid being subsumed. These are the Primal Zerg, who have much the same genetic abilities but are not bound to the Overmind. These creatures are each independently sapient, and if they follow a leader it is because they choose to. Their lack of a Hive Mind also shields them from specific psionic attacks engineered to counter the Zerg Hive Mind.|$|E

5|$|Between 1996 and 1999, the {{administration}} added crucifixes to many classroom walls, {{a change that}} attracted national attention. Before 1996, crucifixes had hung only in hospital rooms and historic classrooms. Some of these crucifixes are historic works of art, and are noted as such. According to Imam Yahya Hendi, the school's on-campus Muslim cleric, pressure to remove the crucifixes comes from within the Catholic community, while he and other campus faith leaders have defended their placement. The Intercultural Center is <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> this controversy, rotating displays of various faith and culture symbols in the lobby. In 2009, Georgetown's religious symbols were brought back to national attention after the university administration concealed the name of Jesus in preparation for President Barack Obama's speech on campus.|$|E
5|$|Bowman {{argued that}} the {{authorized}} sale of the seeds extinguished the patent, and that Bowman merely used seeds legitimately purchased from the silo. He claimed that the Federal Circuit had created <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> the exhaustion doctrine, and that this decision was properly for Congress to decide. Monsanto {{argued that the}} second-generation seeds were not subject to exhaustion because they had not existed until Bowman created them and had not been sold {{at the time of}} infringement. He noted that even when exhaustion applied, it did not allow one to create new copies of the patented product, which the second-generation seeds were.|$|E
5|$|Continued drought, road competition, and {{rationalisation}} of intrastate freight {{operations have}} seen this change in recent years, {{with an average of}} only 6.1 million tonnes of intrastate freight carried from each year between 1996 and 1998; and containers now being the major traffic, with residual cement, logs, quarry, and steel trains operating. By the 1990s road transport has captured most general freight traffic, with less than carload traffic was discontinued in July 2007 {{with the end of the}} Fastrack freight service. <b>An</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> the decline is interstate operations, with intermodal container traffic growing due to competition between private operators.|$|E
