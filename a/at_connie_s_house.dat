40|$|Objective High-risk antepartum {{patients}} {{often require}} long and costly hospitalization. The Mother 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>House</b> facility {{has been used}} to house antepartum women on hospital property as an alternative to inpatient management. This study looked at the cost effectiveness of this facility. Study Design A retrospective chart review on occupants (n = 3 D 111) of the Mother 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>House</b> from 2003 - 2005 was performed. Admission, discharge, and outcome data were collected. A comparison of the cost of management at the Mother 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>House</b> with the estimated cost of inpatient management was then performed. Results A cost savings of 2. 1 million was seen over a 3 -year period {{with the use of the}} Mother 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>House.</b> Demographic data show that patients with positive drug screens are more likely to fail Mother 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>House</b> management.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{existence}} of a U. <b>S.</b> <b>house</b> price bubble. Specifically, we focus on the time series statistical relationship between real U. <b>S.</b> and regional <b>house</b> prices and a number of fundamental economic variables related to house prices using quarterly data from the first quarter of 1975 through the second-quarter of 2005, the approximate end of the recent house price rise. We find that U. <b>S.</b> <b>house</b> prices and our fundamental economic variables are unit root variables that are not cointegrated, even after allowing for structural breaks. Thus our analysis confirms the existence of an interesting and important anomaly suggested by some prior research on this period. We then discuss the implications of our results for the common practice of using error correction models of house prices, and for the current policy debate regarding the causes of the recent U. <b>S.</b> <b>housing</b> market collapse.
