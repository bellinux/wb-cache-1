5|$|Allardyce {{wrote to}} every {{club in the}} top two {{divisions}} to inform them he was <b>available</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> free transfer, and privately lamented choosing his past clubs for financial rather than footballing reasons. Over the summer he played 11 games in the North American Soccer League for the Tampa Bay Rowdies, a club that shared facilities with the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Allardyce subsequently applied in his managerial career many modern practices of American football with regards to training, player management and tactics. He found playing difficult however, due to {{the heat and the}} all-out attacking nature of his teammates, which led to him being frequently exposed at the back, though he found that the club's masseurs managed to cure a long-standing hamstring scar tissue problem.|$|E
5|$|Although cinema, theatre, {{dance and}} live music are popular, the {{favourite}} pastime of the British is watching television. Public broadcast {{television in the}} United Kingdom began in 1936, with {{the launch of the}} BBC Television Service (now BBC One). In the United Kingdom and the Crown dependencies, one must have a television licence to legally receive any broadcast television service, from any source. This includes the commercial channels, cable and satellite transmissions, and the Internet. Revenue generated from the television licence is used to provide radio, television and Internet content for the British Broadcasting Corporation, and Welsh language television programmes for S4C. The BBC, the common abbreviation of the British Broadcasting Corporation, is the world's largest broadcaster. Unlike other broadcasters in the UK, it is a public service based, quasi-autonomous, statutory corporation run by the BBC Trust. Free-to-air terrestrial television channels <b>available</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> national basis are BBC One, BBC Two, ITV, Channel 4 (S4C in Wales), and Five.|$|E
5|$|Campus {{newspapers}} {{include the}} independent student newspaper, The BG News, published since 1920. It {{was known as}} the Bee Gee News before assuming its current name on September 21, 1951. The paper is available for free at 135 newsstands. In 2009 the paper became <b>available</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> web portal known as BG Views. The paper prints 7,000 copies of the paper Monday through Friday during the fall and spring semesters, and on Wednesday during the summer. The university's independent, student operated yearbook was first published in 1918 but stopped after one edition for six years. In 1924 it resumed production and was published every year as a record of students, activities, and events for a given year. In 2008, the yearbook was replaced with a magazine format, The Key Magazine, and is published semi-annually, in fall and spring semesters.|$|E

5|$|Steele was {{investigated}} by a joint FA/Football League inquiry for {{his time as}} Mansfield Town manager in regard to suspected illegal payments – found guilty, {{he was given a}} £250 fine. The good run of results continued though, as they beat fifth-placed Barnsley 1–0 at Oakwell through a Hayward goal. On Christmas Day and Boxing Day Vale recorded two 1–0 wins over Chester, with Hayward again the only player to find the net. Captain Tommy Cheadle pulled a hamstring against Chester, and lost his place in the team as Steele moved the positions around to accommodate Derek Tomkinson in the team. Roland Lewis was made <b>available</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> free transfer in December, and moved to non-league side Witton Albion.|$|E
5|$|WCSP-FM is {{the first}} radio station to {{broadcast}} audiotape of historical U.S. Supreme Court oral arguments, with announcers explaining the court decision {{at the end of}} the recording. The broadcasts of the Supreme Court arguments have provided listeners in the U.S. and Canada with the opportunity to hear spoken words during oral arguments for several of the Court's most influential cases, including the Texas v. Johnson argument over flag-burning in 1989, and the Miranda v. Arizona argument in 1966. In September 2010 the Supreme Court began releasing audio recordings of the week's oral arguments each Friday, thereby allowing C-SPAN Radio to broadcast a selection of current arguments. Prior to this arrangement, recordings of oral arguments were occasionally made <b>available</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> same-day basis, which C-SPAN would request in cases of high public interest.|$|E
5|$|With the {{completion}} of Remember Last Night? Whale immediately {{went to work on}} Show Boat (1936). Whale gathered as many of those as he could who had been involved in one production or another of the musical, including Helen Morgan, Paul Robeson, Charles Winninger, Sammy White, conductor Victor Baravalle, orchestrator Robert Russell Bennett, and, as Magnolia, Irene Dunne, who believed that Whale was the wrong director for the piece. The 1936 version of Show Boat, faithfully adapted from the original stage production, {{is believed to be the}} definitive film version of the musical by many critics. but became unavailable following the 1951 remake.
