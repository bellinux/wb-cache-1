500|$|By about 00:20, 40minutes {{after the}} collision, the loading of the {{lifeboats}} was under way. Second Officer Lightoller recalled afterwards that he noticed Smith {{standing near the}} bridge {{looking out at the}} ocean in a trance-like daze. According to Lightoller, [...] "I yelled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> voice, 'Hadn't we better get the women and children into the boats, sir?' He heard me and nodded reply." [...] Smith then ordered Lightoller and Murdoch to [...] "put the women and children in and lower away". Lightoller took charge of the boats on the port side and Murdoch took charge of those on the starboard side. The two officers interpreted the [...] "women and children" [...] evacuation order differently; Murdoch took it to mean women and children first, while Lightoller took it to mean women and children only. Lightoller lowered lifeboats with empty seats if there were no women and children waiting to board, while Murdoch allowed a limited number of men to board if all the nearby women and children had embarked. Neither officer knew how many people could safely be carried in the boats as they were lowered and they both erred {{on the side of caution}} by not filling them. They could have been lowered quite safely with their full complement of 68 people, especially with the highly favourable weather and sea conditions. Had this been done, an extra 500 people could have been saved; instead, hundreds of people, predominantly men, were left on board as lifeboats were launched with many seats vacant.|$|E

[...] Swinton plays Malkovich's wife who engages in an affair with Clooney, although the two characters do not get along well.

2500|$|Trueman's Test career {{ended in}} 1965 {{after he had}} played {{in the first two}} of a three-match series against New Zealand. He bowed out with a then world record of 307 Test wickets at an average of 21.54. Although he was the first bowler to take 300 Test wickets, he had {{undergone}} numerous clashes and problems with the England cricketing hierarchy. He was not involved in the tours of Australia (1954–55); South Africa (1956–57) and (1964–65); India and Pakistan (1961–62); or India (1963–64). From the beginning {{to the end of his}} international career, England played 118 Tests and he missed 51 of them. He recalled in his memoirs: [...] "Irrespective of the fact I was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> game for Yorkshire and frequently topped the county bowling averages, I was often overlooked for England. To my mind the reason for this was personal. Quite simply, some of the selection committee did not like my forthright attitude, which they misinterpreted as being [...] "bolshy". Rather than pick the best eleven players for the job, the selection committee would often choose someone because he was, in their eyes, a gentleman and a decent chap. Such attributes often took precedence over someone's ability to play international cricket". He also wrote: [...] "For this reason I was selected for far fewer Tests than I believe I should have been. To my mind, if I'd had the opportunity to play in those Tests, I'm sure I would have topped 400 wickets. But that was not to be, even though I was regularly taking 100-plus wickets a season for Yorkshire".|$|E

2500|$|The {{songs on}} the album played {{important}} roles on Aguilera's legacy. [...] "Genie in a Bottle", the album's lead-single, was a number-one hit and Aguilera became the third female artist in 1999 to top the Hot 100 chart with her debut entry, behind Britney Spears's [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] and Jennifer Lopez's [...] "If You Had My Love". Allmusic highlighted that the single incredibly hit number-one on the Billboard's Hot 100 chart before a music video was even out. [...] "Genie" [...] was listed at number 38 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the 90s, About.com placed it at number 2 on her [...] "Top 10 Songs", while AOL Radio ranked at number-one, calling it her [...] "signature song". While listing the [...] "100 Greatest Singers of All Time", Rolling Stone placed Aguilera at number 52, picking [...] "Genie in a Bottle" [...] {{as one of her}} [...] "key tracks", writing that [...] "Even in her teen-pop 'Genie in a Bottle' days, she was modeling her dramatic, melismatic technique on old-school soul heroines like Etta James." [...] It was also the top selling debut single of 1999. The song was also covered by contestants of many popular talent shows such as American Idol, The X Factor and The Voice. The success of the follow-up single [...] "What a Girl Wants" [...] solidified her as a strong musical force and earned her several accolades, including five MTV Video Music Awards nominations and a Grammy Award nomination. The song's title inspired the title of 2000's American romantic comedy film [...] "What Women Want", having the track on its soundtrack and on a scene. It also inspired the title of the 2003 comedy film of the same name. [...] "I Turn to You" [...] inspired American recording artist Lady Gaga, as she stated, [...] "When I was 15, I was singing 'I Turn to You' <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> lungs trying to hit all her notes. So she was an inspiration to me to have a wider vocal range." [...] With the album's fourth single, [...] "Come on Over Baby (All I Want Is You)", Aguilera managed to have three number-one singles for the same album and four top-ten singles, an achievement she only did with her first album. As well as that, The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame listed the album at #127 on their 200 Definitive Albums of All Time lists.|$|E
