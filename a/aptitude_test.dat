DynCorp was made responsible for individual training and PA unit training. In June–July 2005 the projected force strength {{was reduced to}} 2000 men. DynCorp and the U.S. Embassy scrutinized the personnel for the new armed forces thoroughly. Recruits had to pass a literacy test, an <b>aptitude</b> <b>test,</b> a drug test and an HIV test, and their names and faces were put on posters which are distributed {{to try to make}} sure none have a history of war crimes or other human rights violations. A new batch of 500 screened personnel started to arrive at the Camp Ware base at VOA Careysburg, inland from Monrovia, for initial training in early November 2007, joining 608 others who had graduated earlier.|$|E

30|$|Overall, {{the results}} {{indicate}} that <b>aptitude</b> <b>tests</b> work best both for natives and immigrants, irrespective of the timing of treatment. When applied early during the welfare spell, skill provision is helpful for welfare recipients, too. Job search training and combined training programs are rather ineffective. <b>Aptitude</b> <b>tests</b> and skill provision are programs that have a direct focus on employment uptake. They aim at increasing qualifications demanded by the labor market. <b>Aptitude</b> <b>tests,</b> for example, include the screening of participants’ potential to work in occupations looked for by employers and the teaching of skills relevant in these occupations. Therefore, <b>aptitude</b> <b>tests</b> improve the matching quality between participants and open jobs. Skill provision also aims at increasing qualifications demanded by employers. However, the focus of skill provision is more general than in the case of <b>aptitude</b> <b>tests.</b> It involves mainly qualifications that are not occupation-specific but are basic requirements for employment uptake in many occupations (e.g. computer courses). In contrast to <b>aptitude</b> <b>tests</b> and skill provision, job search training does not provide a direct path to employment. It {{can be seen as a}} preparatory program for employment uptake. The program helps to get in touch with employers, but does not provide specific skills required by them. This might explain the disappointing employment effects of this program. A combination of job search training with skill provision or <b>aptitude</b> <b>tests</b> might be more effective.|$|R

5|$|In 1975, {{while serving}} at the FCO, Penfold volunteered {{to learn a}} {{difficult}} language {{in the hope of}} advancing his career. After passing an <b>aptitude</b> <b>test,</b> he was assigned a professional language tutor and began learning Amharic—the official language of Ethiopia—and after six weeks of tuition, was sent to Gondar to continue learning the language by living in Ethiopia. Shortly after, he was posted to Addis Ababa as second secretary, because the British ambassador to Ethiopia, Sir Willie Morris, was keen to have an Amharic-speaking second secretary. Penfold was responsible for monitoring and reporting on internal Ethiopian affairs and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), as the latter was based in Addis. As part of the role, Penfold was required to attend and report on meetings of the OAU, which took place all over Africa. On the instruction of Foreign Secretary David Owen, Penfold met with the leaders of the independence movement in Southern Rhodesia (modern-day Zimbabwe) at an OAU conference in Gabon in 1977. There he met separately with Bishop Muzorewa, Joshua Nkomo, and Robert Mugabe. Penfold believed Mugabe to be difficult to work with, but later stated that it should have been obvious that Mugabe would come to power in Zimbabwe and that the British government could have made a greater effort to work with him.|$|E
