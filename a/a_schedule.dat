It is now listed as <b>a</b> <b>Schedule</b> 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). <b>A</b> <b>Schedule</b> 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.

40|$|Using {{two types}} of {{corporate}} events, <b>a</b> <b>scheduled</b> announcement and <b>an</b> unscheduled announcement, I investigate the effect of information asymmetry on trading volume.

Finally, analyzing the relationship between this decreasing trading volume and proxies of ex ante information asymmetry, such as analyst coverage, size, and industry categorization, I test and confirm an information asymmetry hypothesis about the trading volume pattern before <b>a</b> <b>scheduled</b> announcement.

5|$|All the inhabitants, {{including}} {{the young and}} elderly, were subject to <b>a</b> <b>schedule</b> of alternating work, religious practice, and rest.

The catechumens were instructed by the Jesuits in various arts. They learned very quickly and soon became proficient carpenters, painters, weavers, sculptors and artisans. Each settlement had its own set of craftsmen; as a result, in addition to the caciques, a new social class of craftsmen and artisans emerged. This group {{and the rest of the}} population, who worked primarily in agriculture or cattle raising, were each represented by two alcaldes. Initially the main commercial products included honey, yerba matÃ©, salt, tamarind, cotton, shoes, and leather.

5|$|Alprazolam {{was first}} {{released}} by Upjohn (now {{a part of}} Pfizer) in 1981. The first approved use was of panic disorder, and within two years of its original marketing, Xanax became a blockbuster drug in the US. As of 2010, alprazolam is the most prescribed and the most misused benzodiazepine in the US. The potential for misuse among those taking it for medical reasons is controversial, with some expert reviews stating that the risk is low and {{similar to that of}} other benzodiazepine drugs. Others state that there is a substantial risk of misuse and dependence in both patients and non-medical users and that the high affinity binding, high potency, short elimination half-life, and rapid onset of action may increase the misuse potential of alprazolam. Compared to the large number of prescriptions, relatively few individuals increase their dose on their own initiative or engage in drug-seeking behavior. Alprazolam is classified as <b>a</b> <b>Schedule</b> IV controlled substance by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).|$|E
