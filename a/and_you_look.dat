500|$|Fincher {{decided to}} use the digital Thomson Viper Filmstream camera to shoot the film. Fincher had {{previously}} used the Thomson Viper {{over the past three years}} on commercials for Nike, Hewlett Packard, Heineken and Lexus which allowed him to get used to and experiment with the equipment. He was able to use inexpensive desktop software like Final Cut Pro to edit Zodiac. Fincher remarked in an interview, [...] "Dailies almost always end up being disappointing, like the veil is pierced <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at it for the first time and think, 'Oh my god, this is what I really have to work with.' But when you can see what you have as it's gathered, it can be a much less neurotic process." ...|$|E
500|$|Kove's first {{ideas for}} The Danish Poet began {{when she went}} {{through a period of}} self-assessment; she wanted to write a story about what she {{described}} as when [...] "you reach a turning point or a milestone <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> back and you think 'how in the heck did I get here?' [...] And you realize that the answer lies somewhere in a complex web of all kinds of stuff, like genetic make-up, upbringing, coincidences, choices you made along the way, missed opportunities, [...] lucky breaks." [...] She felt that it was a natural choice to centre on a relationship between two people, [...] "because relationships, and especially the romantic ones, play a huge role in shaping our lives, and also, obviously, in creating new ones." ...|$|E
500|$|Woon, a Peranakan, {{was born}} on 12 September 1956 in Singapore to schoolteachers. He was a head prefect at Pasir Panjang Primary School (which his father became {{principal}} of years later) and a prefect while at Raffles Institution. Following his A-levels he was considering business administration, but ended up accepting a scholarship from DBS Bank to study law instead. According to Woon in an April 2008 interview, [...] "When I went for the scholarship interview, the interviewer said, 'We looked at your results <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> like {{you might be a}} lawyer; {{would you like to do}} law?' I said, 'Fine, if you want to give me the scholarship to do law, I'll do law'. I didn't plan to do law." ...|$|E

500|$|Anna Popplewell as Susan Pevensie, {{the second}} oldest Pevensie. Popplewell had been {{disappointed}} she barely used her {{bow and arrow}} in the first film. Adamson convinced Douglas Gresham to have her present during the battles by suggesting her passive role in the novel indicated Lewis' view of women before he met Joy Gresham. [...] "I think [...] cast women down in the earlier books, {{but when you look}} at The Horse and His Boy, it has a strong female character. Doug's mother was a strong woman." [...] Adamson also chose to have her fall for Caspian, because [...] "The kids are growing up. If you look at Ben <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at Anna, it seems really implausible that they wouldn't have some feelings for each other." [...] He knew it had to be [...] "sensitively handled" [...] though, and ultimately it is not about romance, but [...] " [...] the fact that you can have a wondrous experience, enjoy it and move on". Popplewell added that it would not make sense for the Narnians not to use Susan, a talented archer, in battle, and that the romance contributed to her character's reconciliation with losing Narnia in the first place.|$|E
500|$|In 1974, Glenn {{declined}} Gilligan's and {{the state}} Democratic party's request that he run for lieutenant governor and challenged Metzenbaum again for the other Ohio Senate seat (vacated by Republican William B. Saxbe, who became U.S. Attorney General in early 1974). Metzenbaum was the short-term incumbent, appointed by Gilligan in January. In the primary, Metzenbaum contrasted his strong business background with Glenn's military and astronaut credentials and said that his opponent had [...] "never held a payroll". Glenn's reply {{became known as the}} [...] "Gold Star Mothers" [...] speech. He told Metzenbaum to go to a veterans' hospital and [...] "look those men with mangled bodies in the eyes and tell them they didn't hold a job. You go with me to any Gold Star mother <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> her in the eye and tell her that her son did not hold a job". He defeated Metzenbaum 54 to 46 percent before defeating Ralph Perk (the Republican mayor of Cleveland) in the general election, beginning a Senate career which would continue until 1999. Glenn was reelected in 1980, defeating Republican challenger Jim Betts by over 40 percent. Metzenbaum ran again in 1976 against the incumbent, Taft, winning a close race on Jimmy Carter's coattails.|$|E
500|$|... "Clown"'s concept {{deals with}} an {{incident}} that happened in San Diego, California. A skinhead that told Davis to [...] "go back to Bakersfield" [...] attempted to hit Davis but he dodged and the band's road manager, Jeff, knocked the skinhead out. [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] was about Davis' drug abuse, and the fear that gripped him {{at the height of}} his drug problem. He pleaded for a divine intervention to deliver him from his nightmare, as if he cannot help himself. Davis explained: [...] "I'd wake up in the morning and do a line to get out of bed. Speed in the morning, I'd have it all lined up for breakfast so when I'd lay down and go to sleep, I'd wake up and just snort and it's like 'Yeah, okay, I'm up. ' It was bad. It's like, you do one line and stay up all night, but then you have shit to do the next day so you have to do another line to be able keep staying up to get that shit done. Eventually you start spinning-out from sleep deprivation. You get hallucinations and shit like that." [...] Davis said that [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] "is about meth. It's about when you do meth <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> down at your dick and it's literally a helmet in the bush [...] ". [...] "Basically it's what happens when you do too much drugs and your girl wanna get with you and you got some man problems down below. Just another reason not to do drugs, children," [...] Fieldy elaborated.|$|E

500|$|Portman and Kunis started {{training}} {{six months}} before the start of filming in order to attain a body type and muscle tone more similar to those of professional dancers. Portman worked out for five hours a day, doing ballet, cross-training, and swimming. A few months closer to filming, she began choreography training. Kunis engaged in cardio and Pilates, [...] "train seven days a week, five hours, for five, six months total, and ... was put on a very strict diet of 1,200 calories a day." [...] She lost 20 pounds from her normal weight of about 117 pounds, and reported that Portman [...] "became smaller than I did." [...] Kunis said, [...] "I did ballet as a kid like every other kid does ballet. You wear a tutu and you stand on stage <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> cute and twirl. But this is very different because you can't fake it. You can't just stay in there and like pretend you know what you're doing. Your whole body has to be structured differently." [...] Georgina Parkinson, a ballet mistress from the American Ballet Theatre (ABT), coached the actors in ballet. ABT soloists Sarah Lane and Maria Riccetto served as [...] "dance doubles" [...] for Portman and Kunis respectively. Dancer Kimberly Prosa also served as a double for Portman. She stated: [...] "Natalie took class, she studied for several months, from the waist up is her. Sarah Lane a soloist at ABT, did the heavy tricks, she did the fouett√©s, but they only had her for a limited time, a couple of weeks, so I did the rest of whatever dance shots they needed." ...|$|E
