60|$|Spring evenings {{are often}} cold and raw, and though {{this had been}} a fine day, warm even in the morning and {{meridian}} sunshine, the <b>air</b> <b>chilled</b> at sunset, the ground crisped, and ere dusk a hoar frost was insidiously stealing over growing grass and unfolding bud. It whitened the pavement in front of Briarmains (Mr. Yorke's residence), and made silent havoc among the tender plants in his garden, and on the mossy level of his lawn. As to that great tree, strong-trunked and broad-armed, which guarded the gable nearest the road, it seemed to defy a spring-night frost to harm its still bare boughs; and so did the leafless grove of walnut-trees rising tall behind the house.|$|E
6000|$|On {{his return}} that night--the night {{succeeding}} his last intermission--he {{stood in the}} hall and looked up the staircase with a certainty more intimate than any he had yet known. [...] "He's there, at the top, and waiting--not, as in general, falling back for disappearance. He's holding his ground, and it's the first time--which is a proof, isn't it? that something has happened for him." [...] So Brydon argued with his hand on the banister and his foot on the lowest stair; in which position he felt as never before the <b>air</b> <b>chilled</b> by his logic. He himself turned cold in it, for he seemed of a sudden to know what now was involved. [...] "Harder pressed?--yes, he takes it in, with its thus making clear to him that I've come, as they say, 'to stay.' He finally doesn't like and can't bear it, in the sense, I mean, that his wrath, his menaced interest, now balances with his dread. I've hunted him till he has 'turned'; that, up there, is what has happened--he's the fanged or the antlered animal brought at last to bay." [...] There came to him, as I say--but determined by an influence beyond my notation!--the acuteness of this certainty; under which however the next moment he had broken into a sweat that he would as little have consented to attribute to fear as he would have dared immediately to act upon it for enterprise. It marked none the less a prodigious thrill, a thrill that represented sudden dismay, no doubt, but also represented, and with the selfsame throb, the strangest, the most joyous, possibly the next minute almost the proudest, duplication of consciousness.|$|E

50|$|Hudson Plains has short mild {{summers and}} long harsh winters. It is {{considered}} a continental climate. There is little opportunity to grow food because of the short growing season that is only around 110 days each year and the cold weather. The mean annual temperatures range from -7 degrees Celsius to -2 degrees Celsius. The annual precipitation ranges from around 400-800mm. The climate here is strongly influenced by the cold Hudson Bay low-pressured and polar high-pressure air masses. The climate depends largely on the water surface during {{certain parts of the}} year. In the winter months the bay is covered almost entirely by pack ice and this keeps the <b>air</b> <b>chilled</b> and thus temperatures stay consistently low. Cold, dry arctic air typically lingers over the area throughout winter. Gust can sometimes become violent, reaching speeds of up to 130 km/h. The ice begins melting in May and is almost completely gone by the beginning of June. This brings in the rainy season with an abundance of clouds and fog. After a brief and mild summer the temperatures begin to lower again and rain and snow showers become prominent in October and November. The temperature and precipitation correlate closely with latitude. The predominant global pattern that affects the climate is the polar cell. This system cycles the cool polar easterlies with the polar front westerlies and in doing so creates the cold climate but also allows for a moderate amount of precipitation in the region.|$|E
5000|$|Chilled beam {{systems are}} not a panacea. Additional {{ductwork}} {{may be needed to}} meet minimum outdoor air requirements. Both types of chilled beam systems are less effective at heating than cooling, and supplementary heating systems are often needed. Chilled beam systems cannot be used alone in buildings where the ceilings are higher than 2.7 m, because the air will not properly circulate. A forced-air circulation system must be employed in such cases. If the water temperature is too low or humidity is high, condensation on the beam can occur—leading to a problem known as [...] "internal rain." [...] (In some cases, drier outside air can be mixed with the wetter inside air to reduced interior humidity levels while maintaining system performance.) Chilled beam {{systems are not}} recommended for areas with high humidity (such as theaters, gymnasiums, or cafeterias). Because they are less effective at cooling, passive chilled beam systems are generally ill-suited for semi-tropical and tropical climates. Hospitals generally cannot use chilled beam systems because of restrictions on using recirculated <b>air.</b> <b>Chilled</b> beam systems are also known to cause noticeable air circulation which can make some people uncomfortable. (Passive air deflection devices can help disrupt these air patterns, alleviating the problem.) Some designers have found that enlarging the ducts around active chilled beam systems to increase air circulation causes echoes in working areas and amplifies the sound of water moving through the pipes to noticeable levels.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we suggest a new ice cave type: the “{{flow-through}}” ice cave. In a flow-through ice cave external winds blow {{into the cave}} and wet cave walls chill the incoming air to the wet-bulb temperature, thereby achieving extra cooling of the cave air. We have investigated an ice cave in Idaho, located in a lava tube that {{is reported to have}} airflow through porous wet end-walls and could therefore be a flow-through cave. We have instrumented the site and collected data for one year. In order to determine the actual ice cave type present at Shoshone, we have constructed numerical models for static and flow-through caves (dynamic is not relevant here). The models are driven with exterior measurements of air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed. The model output is interior air temperature and relative humidity. We then compare the output of both models to the measured interior air temperatures and relative humidity. While both the flow-through and static cave models are capable of preserving ice year-round (a net zero or positive ice mass balance), both models show very different cave air temperature and relative humidity output. We find the empirical data support a hybrid model of the static and flow-through models: permitting a static ice cave to have incoming <b>air</b> <b>chilled</b> to the wet-bulb temperature fits the data best for the Shoshone Ice Cave. ...|$|E

This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of postmortem electrical stimulation (ES) on tenderness, absorbance ratio (r-value), pH, and drip loss of breast fillets following air chilling. In each of four replications, eight birds were electrically stimulated and twelve birds were used as controls. The ES birds were stimulated at the head in a l% saline bath(45 OV,. 45 A, 2 son/lsofffor 7 pulses). After evisceration the carcasses were <b>air</b> <b>chilled</b> in a cooler at 1 - 20 C with an average relative humidity of 9 1 % and an air speed of 43. 9 m 3 /minute. Pre-chill and post-chill carcass weights were measured to determine drip loss. Breast fillets were harvested at 2 and 4 h postmortem from both ES and control carcasses and also at 8 h postmortem from control carcasses. Fillets were aged on ice while the fillet tips were excised and frozen for later measurement of pH and r-value. Although there was no significant ES effect on shear value at 2 h postmortem, the ES fillets had a significantly (P< 0. 05) lower shear value mean than the control fillets at 4 h postmortem. There {{was no significant difference between}} the shear value means of the ES 4 h fillets and the control 8 h fillets. ES accelerated the normal postmortem decline in pH at both 2 and 4 h postmortem. The r-value means for the control and ES samples were similar at 2 h postmortem, but the r-value mean of the ES samples was significantly (P< 0. 05) higher than the control at 4 h postmortem. There was no significant effect upon drip loss by ES at any of the sampling times. These results suggest that, when followed by air chilling, ES 50 %, and has no effect upon drip loss...|$|E

40|$|Poultry meat can be {{contaminated}} {{with a variety}} of microorganisms, including those capable of spoiling the product during chill storage, and certain foodborne pathogens. Human illness may follow from handling of raw meat, undercooking or mishandling of the cooked product. While Salmonella and Campylobacter spp. remain the organisms of greatest global concern in this respect, others present include the more recently reported Arcobacter and Helicobacter spp. and, occasionally, verotoxigenic Escherichia coli. Also considered here is the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance among poultry-associated pathogens. Because of the need for a systematic and universally applicable approach to food safety control, the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) concept is increasingly being introduced into the Poultry Industry, and Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) is being applied to microbial hazards. Among a number of completed and on-going studies on QRA are those undertaken by FAO/WHO on Salmonella and Campylobacter in broilers. In the case of Campylobacter, however, any QRA must assume at present that all strains have the same pathogenic potential for humans and comparable survival capabilities, even though this is unlikely to be the case. Implementation of the HACCP system in poultry processing plants addresses zoonotic agents that are not detectable by conventional meat inspection procedures and can help to control contamination of carcasses with spoilage organisms. The system brings obvious benefits in optimising plant hygiene, ensuring compliance with legislation and providing evidence of 'due diligence' {{on the part of the}} processor. It is now being applied globally in two different situations: in one, such as that occurring in the USA, carcass contamination is clearly reduced as carcasses pass through the process and are finally chilled in super-chlorinated water. There is also the option to use a chemical-rinse treatment for further reduction of microbial contamination. In the second scenario, processors in the EU are not allowed to super-chlorinate process water, and water chilling, which has an important washing effect, is confined to carcasses intended for freezing. Also, chemical decontamination is prohibited until 2006 at the earliest. Therefore, for fresh carcasses that are <b>air</b> <b>chilled,</b> there is presently no marked reduction in carcass contamination and no Critical Control Point at which a significant reduction in pathogen contamination can be guaranteed. Overall, effective control of the organisms is best realised through a farm-to-fork approach at all stages of the supply chain...|$|E

40|$|The {{scope of}} the current {{experiments}} was to superchill a selection of fresh food by two superchilling methods followed by extensive storage studies and monitoring of quality during superchilled storage. Several methods for superchilling have been implemented at fish processing sites, but to a very limited extent and not adjusted to automated production lines. The current study presents measurements of the efficiency and precision of two methods for superchilling (liquid CO 2 injection and <b>air</b> <b>chilling)</b> {{as well as their}} applicability for the expected development towards automated production lines in fresh food manufacturing. Secondly, as a precision index, the effect of the amount of ice caused by superchilling was investigated with respect to prolonged shelf-life and end product quality.

However, within the tested boundaries for ice fraction, the level of ice stored inside the fillets did not seem to considerably influence on the physical and microbiological quality of the products. 1...|$|R
