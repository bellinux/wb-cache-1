However, numerous bacteria and heavy metal contaminations are often found in herbal products due to irregular handling practices. Ten different brands of products (labeled as A-J) were investigated. Seven heavy metals content such as As, Cd, Pb, Co, Cr, Cu and Zn were analyzed using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and bacterial presence was determined by counting the total <b>aerobic</b> <b>count.</b> The identification of isolates was carried out by macroscopic and microscopic observation, biochemical tests and confirmation using commercial kits of Microgen GN-ID A+B and API 20 E. The heavy metal contents in the samples were below the limit of the standard limitation by WHO and Health Canada. However, sample A contained the highest total daily intake of heavy metals.

40|$|Edible {{insects are}} gaining {{more and more}} {{attention}} as a sustainable source of animal protein for food and feed in the future. In Belgium, some insect products {{can be found on}} the market, and consumers are sourcing fresh insects from fishing stores or towards traditional markets to find exotic insects that are illegal and not sanitarily controlled. From this perspective, this study aims to characterize the microbial load of edible insects found in Belgium (i. e., fresh mealworms and house crickets from European farms and smoked termites and caterpillars from a traditional Congolese market) and to evaluate the efficiency of different processing methods (blanching for all species and freeze-drying and sterilization for European species) in reducing microorganism counts. All untreated insect samples had a total <b>aerobic</b> <b>count</b> higher than the limit for fresh minced meat (6. 7 log cfu/g). Nevertheless, a species-dependent blanching step has led to a reduction of the total <b>aerobic</b> <b>count</b> under this limit, except for one caterpillar species. Freeze-drying and sterilization treatments on European species were also effective in reducing the total <b>aerobic</b> <b>count.</b> Yeast and mold counts for untreated insects were above the Good Manufacturing Practice limits for raw meat, but all treatments attained a reduction of these microorganisms under this limit. These results confirmed that fresh insects, but also smoked insects from non-European trades, need a cooking step (at least composed of a first blanching step) before consumption. Therefore, blanching timing for each studied insect species is proposed and discussed. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Mastitis is an {{inflammation}} of the mammary glands {{and in most cases}} it is caused by the presence of microorganisms. High mastitis rates in dairy cattle herds can cause an increase in total microorganism counts of bulk tank milk. The present paper was aimed at verifying whether the occurrence of mastitis in dairy cattle herds is reflected in raw-milk indicators of hygienic-sanitary quality. To observe the correlation among the analysed variables, we performed a logarithmical transformation (log 10) of different indicator counts of raw milk and compared them with the occurrence of mastitis in dairy cattle herds. Few correlations were observed among mastitis cases in dairy cattle herds and the raw-milk indicators of hygienic-sanitary quality. We observed a negative correlation between the log 10 of mesophilic <b>aerobic</b> plate <b>counts</b> and psychotropic <b>aerobic</b> plate <b>counts</b> when compared with the occurrence of no bacterial growth.

Two case-control studies (n = 30 pairs; n = 65 pairs) of 18 -wk-old tom turkeys were conducted. A case {{was defined as a}} carcass condemned by the veterinary inspector for cyanosis, and a control carcass was one that passed inspection. Microbiological tests were conducted on samples of Pectoralis major and Gastrocnemius lacteralis. A modified Rappaport Vassiliadis medium was used for Salmonella, and a Petrifilm method was used to assess <b>aerobic</b> <b>counts,</b> coliform counts, and Escherichia coli. The Salmonella (qualitative) test was negative for all cases and controls, and {{there were no significant differences}} between the <b>aerobic</b> <b>counts,</b> coliform counts, and E. coli counts of case and control carcasses.

40|$|The {{object of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the influence of chilled storage (2 °C) and final chopping temperatures (8, 15 and 22 °C) on the characteristics and stability of Bologna sausage containing two levels of fat (8. 5 and 23 %). When the fat level was reduced there was a significant decrease in penetration force and an increase in both cooking and purge loss. A lower chopping temperature reduced purge loss during chilled storage. In general, an inverse relationship was found between chopping temperature and penetration force. Chopping temperature did not influence total <b>aerobic</b> <b>count,</b> but during chilled storage counts were significantly higher in the low fat sausages. Copyright © 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Two preliminary studies were conducted to select the best fish-soy protein-spice mixture combination with four treatments to develop breaded fish sticks. Developed products were organoleptically assessed using 30 untrained panellists with 7 -point hedonic scale. The product developed with new combination was compared with market product. Sixty percent of Tilapia fish mince, 12 % of Defatted Textured Soy protein (DTSP), 1. 6 % of salt and 26. 4 % of ice water (0. 05). Total <b>aerobic</b> <b>count</b> and yeast and mould count were in acceptable ranges in frozen storage for 5 weeks. Data were analyzed using AN OVA and Friedman non-parametric test...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{microbial}} {{content of}} unfrozen and frozen ground turkey meat (GTM) in re-tail {{markets and the}} thermal resistance of Salmonella oranienburg in GTM was determined. The un-frozen product had an average total <b>aerobic</b> <b>count</b> of 53 X 104 cells per g. These counts reduced slightly when held in a display case for one and two days at 1 — 2 C. The frozen GTM contained 25 % protein, 8 % fat, 63 % moisture and had a pH of 6. 2. Microbial counts averaged 58 X 104. The time and temperatures to kill ca 104 S. oranienburg cells were determined.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the efficacy of delactosed whey permeate (DWP) treatment on the physico-chemical, microbial and antioxidant compounds of tomatoes stored at 15 °C for 21 days compared with traditional chlorine treatment. Fresh tomatoes were treated with 3 ml/ 100 ml DWP or 120 mg/L chlorine solutions and packed in perforated polypropylene bags. The results showed that DWP treatment significantly reduced the number of total <b>aerobic</b> <b>counts</b> (~ 1. 62 log cfu/g) and yeast and moulds (~ 1. 66 log cfu/g) of tomatoes compared to chlorine during storage. Moreover, the tomatoes treated by DWP remained firmer (22 %) than the control fruits and maintained significantly (...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationship of biofilms and physicochemical properties of soil samples with corrosion of water pipelines in Barkin-Sale, Bosso, Chanchaga, Keteren-Gwari, Maikunkele and Kwangila areas of Minna metropolis. Corroded water pipes and soil samples were analysed for microbiological and physicochemical properties and their influence on corrosion correlated between the months of February and July, 2008. The corrosion products detected in the soil samples were sulphide and phosphide. The mean concentration of sulphide ranged from 1020 to 3033 ppm and that of phosphide ranged from 13. 50 to 22. 58 ppm. The mean organic carbon ranged from 0. 35 to 0. 89 %, mean organic matter ranged from 0. 62 to 1. 57 %, mean pH ranged from 6. 73 to 7. 70 and mean moisture ranged from 4. 33 to 16. 63 %. There {{was a significant difference}} (P 0. 05) in their pH. The mean total <b>aerobic</b> bacterial <b>counts</b> ranged from 3. 5 x 103 cfu/g to 7. 2 x 104 cfu/g, mean total <b>aerobic</b> bacterial <b>counts</b> ranged from 3. 0 x 103 cfu/g t 0 5. 6 x 105 cfu/g. total <b>aerobic</b> bacterial <b>counts</b> (TABC) was positively correlated with phosphide and negatively correlated with organic matter, pH, moisture, total fungal counts (TFC) and total anaerobic bacterial counts (TAnBC).
