Control schools received only the hand hygiene education session. The primary outcome was the number of absence episodes due to any illness among 2, 443 follow-up children whose caregivers were telephoned after each absence from school. Secondary outcomes measured among follow-up children were the number of absence episodes due to specific illness (respiratory or gastrointestinal), length of illness and illness absence episodes, and number of episodes where at least one other member of the household became ill subsequently (child or adult). We also examined whether provision of sanitiser was associated with experience of a skin reaction. The number of absences for any reason and the length of the absence episode were measured in all primary school children enrolled at the schools. Children, school administrative staff, and the school liaison research assistants were not blind to group allocation. Outcome assessors of follow-up children were blind to group allocation. Of the 1, 301 and 1, 142 follow-up children in the hand sanitiser and control groups, respectively, the rate of absence episodes due to illness per 100 child-days was similar (1. 21 and 1. 16, respectively, incidence rate ratio 1. 06, 95 % CI 0. 94 to 1. 18). The provision of an <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> <b>sanitiser</b> dispenser in classrooms was not effective in reducing rates of absence episodes due to respiratory or gastrointestinal illness, the length of illness or illness absence episodes, or the rate of subsequent infection for other members of the household in these children. The percentage of children experiencing a skin reaction was similar (10. 4 % hand sanitiser versus 10. 3 % control, risk ratio 1. 01, 95 % CI 0. 78 to 1. 30). The rate or length of absence episodes for any reason measured for all children also did not differ between groups. Limitations of the study include that the study was conducted during an influenza pandemic, with associated public health messaging about hand hygiene, which may have increased hand hygiene among all children and thereby reduced any additional effectiveness of sanitiser provision. We did not quite achieve the planned sample size of 1, 350 follow-up children per group, although we still obtained precise estimates of the intervention effects. Also, it is possible that follow-up children were healthier than non-participating eligible children, with therefore less to gain from improved hand hygiene. However, lack of effectiveness of hand sanitiser provision on the rate of absences among all children suggests that {{this may not be the}} explanation. CONCLUSIONS: The provision of hand sanitiser in addition to usual hand hygiene in primary schools in New Zealand did not prevent disease of severity sufficient to cause school absence.

40|$|BackgroundHand hygiene is the {{cornerstone}} of aseptic techniques to reduce surgical site infection. Conventional surgical scrub is effective for disinfecting a surgeon's hands. However, the compliance of conventional scrub may be hindered by skin damage, allergy, and time. <b>Alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> rub has a satisfactory antimicrobial effect, but mostly in laboratory settings. Our aim was to compare a conventional surgical scrub with an <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> rub to evaluate antimicrobial efficacy. MethodsFrom June 1, 2010 to July 31, 2011, 128 healthcare workers were enrolled in the study. They used an <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> rub or a conventional surgical scrub as preoperative hand antisepsis during their routine practice. Hand sampling for cultures were performed before and after operations. Positive culture plates were further processed for pathogen identification. ResultsThe culture positive rate of the <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> rub was 6. 2 % before operations and 10. 8 % after operations. Both rates were lower than the conventional surgical scrub [47. 6 % before operations (p <  0. 001) and 25. 4 % after operations (p =  0. 03) ]. The most identified pathogens were Gram-positive with coagulase-negative staphylococci being the major pathogen. Multivariate analysis showed that prior hand condition (p =  0. 21) and type of surgery such as cardiovascular surgery (p =  0. 12) were less relevant, but the <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> rub was a significant protective factor for positive <b>hand</b> cultures.

40|$|Abstract Background New Zealand has {{relatively}} {{high rates of}} morbidity and mortality from infectious disease compared with other OECD countries, with infectious disease being more prevalent in children compared with others in the population. Consequences of infectious disease in children may have significant economic and social impact beyond the direct effects of the disease on the health of the child; including absence from school, transmission of infectious disease to other pupils, staff, and family members, and time off work for parents/guardians. Reduction of the transmission of infectious disease between children at schools could be an effective way of reducing the community incidence of infectious disease. Alcohol based no-rinse <b>hand</b> <b>sanitisers</b> provide an alternative hand cleaning technology, for which {{there is some evidence that}} they may be effective in achieving this. However, very few studies have investigated the effectiveness of <b>hand</b> <b>sanitisers,</b> and importantly, the potential wider economic implications of this intervention have not been established. Aims The primary objective of this trial is to establish if the provision of <b>hand</b> <b>sanitisers</b> in primary schools in the South Island of New Zealand, in addition to an education session on hand hygiene, reduces the incidence rate of absence episodes due to illness in children. In addition, the trial will establish the cost-effectiveness and conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the intervention in this setting. Methods/Design A cluster randomised controlled trial will be undertaken to establish the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of <b>hand</b> <b>sanitisers.</b> Sixty-eight primary schools will be recruited from three regions in the South Island of New Zealand. The schools will be randomised, within region, to receive <b>hand</b> <b>sanitisers</b> and an education session on hand hygiene, or an education session on hand hygiene alone. Fifty pupils from each school in years 1 to 6 (generally aged from 5 to 11 years) will be randomly selected for detailed follow-up about their illness absences, providing a total of 3400 pupils. In addition, absence information will be collected on all children from the school rolls. Investigators not involved in the running of the trial, outcome assessors, and the statistician will be blinded to the group allocation until the analysis is completed.

We assessed {{the number of}} CDAD tests requested, CDAD positivity rates, the use of <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> rubs, and antimicrobial utilization. MethodsWe collected information on every adult patient (> 18 years) who developed diarrhea and had a positive stool test for C. difficile toxin from June 2005 to December 2009 at a tertiary care hospital. A time-series analysis was performed using monthly data on the incidence of C. difficile infection (CDI) (i. e., cases of infection per 1000 patient-days), {{as well as the}} consumption of <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> rubs (in liters/ 1000 -patient days) and antibiotics (in defined daily doses per 1000 patient-days). ResultsThe mean number of annual requests for C. difficile tests was 1031, and the rates per 1000 patient-days for each year from 2005 to 2009 were 0. 30, 0. 46, 0. 39, 0. 31, and 0. 40 overall in the hospital, and 0. 18, 0. 10, 0. 53, 0. 38, and 0. 37 {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU).

40|$|Background The {{introduction}} of <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> rub dispensers {{has had a}} positive influence on compliance of healthcare workers with the recommended guidelines for hand hygiene. However, establishing the best location for <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> rub dispensers remains a problem, and no method is currently available to optimize the location of these devices. In this paper we describe a method to determine the optimal location for <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> rub dispensers in patient rooms. Methods We composed a method that consists of a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods. Firstly, different arrangements of dispensers were determined {{based on the results of}} two types of assessment: workflow observations and interviews with nurses and physicians. Each arrangement was then evaluated using two types of assessment: interviews with nurses and physicians and electronic measurements of the user frequency of the dispensers. This procedure was applied in a single-bed patient room on a thoracic surgery intensive care unit. Results The workflow observations revealed that the activities of patient care were most often at the entrance and near the computer at the right side of the test room. Healthcare workers stated that the location of the dispenser should meet several requirements. Measurements of the frequency of use showed that the dispenser located near the computer, at the back of the room, was used less frequently than the dispenser located near the sink and the dispenser located at the entrance to the room. Conclusion The applied method has potential for determining the optimal location for <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> rub dispensers in a patient room. Workflow observations and the expressed preferences of healthcare workers guide the choice for the location of <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> rub dispensers. These choices may be optimized based on measurement of the frequency of use of the dispensers. Industrial DesignIndustrial Design Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{emergence}} {{and spread}} of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) {{has become a}} serious public health threat. Rational antibacterial policy, combined with enforcement of infection control practices are key strategies to combat AMR in the hospital setting. Loss of antibacterial activity {{as a direct result}} of antibacterial consumption can be modelled via the economic approach of a negative externality. Objective: To determine the externalities of antibacterial consumption and <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> rub use for hand disinfection. Methods: A simple model was built, combining the results of a recently conducted cost-of-illness study with the results of a multivariate time-series analysis, which determined the impact of antibacterial consumption and <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> rub use on the incidence of hospital-acquired infections caused by meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Results: Consumption of a single defined daily dose of second-generation cephalosporins, third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and lincosamides is associated with a negative externality of about &U 20 AC; 5, &U 20 AC; 15, &U 20 AC; 11 and &U 20 AC; 12, respectively. In contrast, use of 1 litre of <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> rub solution for hand disinfection is associated with a positive externality of about &U 20 AC; 61. In other words, a single disinfection of the hands (use of 3 [*]mL <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> rub solution) saves an average &U 20 AC; 0. 18 of the potential cost incurred by MRSA-related infections. Conclusions: Quantifying the externalities of antibacterial use and <b>alcohol-based</b> <b>hand</b> rub use may lead to changes in prescribing behaviour and increase compliance with hand disinfection. Furthermore, the presented methodology of relating the cost of resistance to specific factors such as antibacterial use and hand disinfection provides information that may be useful for prioritizing prevention methods.
