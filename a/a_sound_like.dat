25|$|When {{playing the}} bodhrán as an accompaniment to Irish music, {{different}} beats may be used. For example, reels have a 4/4 time. The bodhrán player must stick to this rhythm but {{is free to}} improvise within the structure: most simply, s/he may enunciate the first beat of four, making <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> ONE two three four ONE two three four; but s/he can syncopate, put in double pulses, according to the rhythmic characteristics of the tunes being played. This {{is the difference between}} sensitive and insensitive playing, a matter of much concern to other traditional musicians. Because the bodhrán typically plays 16th notes (Kerry style), a great deal of variety can be introduced by these syncopations and the use of rests. Combined with manual pitch changes and naturally occurring tonal variations in an animal skin drumhead, the bodhrán can almost sound as melodically expressive as other non-percussive instruments.|$|E

[...] Similarly, Collin Brennan, of Consequence of Sound, said it was [...] "totally worth all the buzz", and Stereogum writer James Rettig dubbed the track: [...] "more than good enough on its own, an enticing and theatrical piece of futuristic pop music". Fact published a review of [...] "Landcruisin, to which five journalists contributed with commentary, and their score out of 10 points.

[...] Aurora Mitchell of the same publication explained her score of 8 by saying she was [...] "definitely here for it". With respective ratings of 5 and 6, Chris Kelly and Son Raw were more critical of the song– both negatively compared A.K.

500|$|Shortly after {{returning}} to Dublin, Bono wrote lyrics for a song about the funeral that he titled [...] "One Tree Hill" [...] after the hill he remembered from his visit to Auckland in 1984. The music was developed early in the recording sessions for The Joshua Tree. The Edge said, [...] "We were jamming with Brian [...] He was playing keyboards ... we just got this groove going, and this part began to come through. It's almost highlife, although it's not African at all ... the sound was for me at that time a very elaborate one. I would never have dreamt of using <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> that before then, but it just felt right, and I went with it." [...] Bono recorded his vocals in a single take, as {{he felt that he}} could not sing the lyrics a second time. The Edge used a Bond Electraglide guitar to play a solo with a [...] "heavy fuzz" [...] sound {{at the end of the}} song. Three musicians from Toronto—Dick, Paul and Adele Armin—recorded string pieces for the song in Grant Avenue Studio in Hamilton, Ontario. In a six-hour phone call with the Edge, and under the supervision of producer Daniel Lanois, the Armins used [...] "sophisticated 'electro-acoustic' string instrument" [...] they developed called Raads to record a piece created for the song. Dick Armin said, [...] " [...] were interested in using strings, but not in the conventional style of sweetening. They didn't want a 19th-century group playing behind them." [...] Bono found the song so emotional, he was unable to listen to it after it had been recorded.|$|E

2500|$|Dal'ona is {{the second}} most popular type of song in Palestine. It is easier to compose than ataba because it does not require the similar sound of the ends of the first three verses.

2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1979 {{the band}} felt {{confident}} enough to start recording their songs, and approached local musician Bob Lamb as {{he was the only}} person they knew with any recording experience. Lamb had been the drummer with the Steve Gibbons Band for much of the 1970s and was a well-known figure within the Birmingham music scene. He remembered that [...] "'King' was the very first song they ever played to me, and it just blew my mind basically, to realise a bunch of kids could make <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> that... it blew me away. And that was it for me, I was hooked, it was a bit like Elvis walks in or something, you know, {{it was one of those}} moments." [...] However, as the band were unable to afford a proper recording studio, the album was recorded in Lamb's own home at the time, a ground-floor flat in a house on Cambridge Road in Birmingham's Moseley district that later became affectionately known as the [...] "Home of the Hits". Lamb would later use the money he earned from the album's success to build a proper recording studio, Highbury Studio, in an old cricket bat factory in nearby Kings Heath, which remained under his ownership until his retirement in 2010 – during the 1980s and 90s he would go on to produce the early demos for Duran Duran and work on the debut albums by fellow Birmingham natives Ruby Turner, The Lilac Time and Ocean Colour Scene.
