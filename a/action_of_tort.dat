25|$|Following Roman law, the English {{system has}} long been based on a closed system <b>of</b> {{nominate}} <b>torts,</b> such as trespass, battery and conversion.

There are various categories <b>of</b> <b>tort,</b> which lead back to the system of separate causes <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> The <b>tort</b> <b>of</b> negligence is however increasing in importance over other types <b>of</b> <b>tort,</b> providing a wide scope of protection, especially since Donoghue v Stevenson. For liability under negligence a duty of care must be established owed to a group of persons to which the victim belongs, a nebulous concept into which many other categories are being pulled.|$|R

The word ‘wrongfully’ is applicable to both cases. ‘Wrongfully’ ... imports the infringement of some right, and any {{invasion of the}} civil rights of another is in itself a legal wrong, and the appropriate action for the violation of the legal right unconnected with contract is an action for tort. The early history <b>of</b> replevin <b>action</b> in England is traced (as) ... ‘The nature of the complaint in the action was for a tortious taking of the goods. Our British Columbia replevin action, which is wider than the English, gives the right to replevy to the party who could maintain trespass or trover. It is given, as it were, supplementary to, or in aid of, the remedy which those actions afford; but as all three actions, trespass, trover and replevin are classed... as <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> <b>tort,</b> I think the action under our British Columbia statute is for the tortious taking or tortious detention of goods.” ...|$|R

40|$|The {{sexual abuse}} of {{children}} by Catholic clergy {{is arguably the most}} acute crisis Catholicism has faced since the Reformation. The prevalence of clergy sexual abuse and its shocking cover-up by church officials have obscured the largely untold story <b>of</b> the <b>tort</b> system 2 ̆ 7 s remarkable success in bringing the scandal to light, focusing attention on the need for institutional reform, and spurring church leaders and public officials into <b>action.</b> Stories <b>of</b> the <b>tort</b> system as an engine of social justice are rare. Holding Bishops Accountable tells one such story by revealing how pleadings, discovery documents, and depositions fueled media coverage of the scandal. Timothy Lytton shows how the litigation strategy of plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 lawyers gave rise to a widespread belief that the real problem was not the <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> individual priests but rather the church 2 ̆ 7 s massive institutional failure. The book documents how church and government policymakers responded to the problem of clergy sexual abuse only under the pressure of private lawsuits. As Lytton deftly demonstrates, the lessons of clergy sexual abuse litigation give us reason to reconsider the case for tort reform and to look more closely at how tort litigation can enhance the performance of public and private policymaking institutions...|$|R

5000|$|The {{action on}} the case for negligence, the rapid {{expansion}} of which is traced to Donoghue v Stevenson 1932.

40|$|All causes <b>of</b> <b>action</b> in <b>tort,</b> {{like all}} causes <b>of</b> <b>action</b> generally, are {{constituted}} by elements or ingredients. It {{is often the}} case that these elements are not crisply separated from each other. That is certainly so in relation to the cause <b>of</b> <b>action</b> in negligence, it having regularly been pointed out that none of its elements is self-contained. Denning L. J. took that view further than most. In Roe v Minister of Health [1954] 2 Q. B. 66, 86, he asserted: “you will find that the three questions, duty, causation, and remoteness, run continually into one another. It seems that they are simply three different ways of looking at one and the same problem. ” More commonly it is accepted that although the various elements <b>of</b> the <b>tort</b> <b>of</b> negligence overlap, they nonetheless retain separate identities. Thus, determining whether the <b>tort</b> <b>of</b> negligence has been committed is not generally understood as requiring a single homogeneous enquiry but an analysis whereby one examines each element <b>of</b> the <b>action</b> seriatim in order to determine whether it is present. This conventional understanding was embraced by Lord Simons, delivering the advice of the Privy Council in Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd. v Morts Dock and Engineering Co. Ltd. [1961] A. C. 388, 425, when he said: “It is, no doubt, proper when considering tortious liability for negligence to analyse its elements and to say that the plaintiff must prove a breach of duty owed by him to the defendant, a breach of that duty by the defendant, and consequent damage. ...|$|R
