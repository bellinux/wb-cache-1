5|$|Most bee-eaters are gregarious. They form colonies, nesting in burrows {{tunnelled}} into vertical sandy banks, often <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a {{river or}} in flat ground. As they mostly live in colonies, {{large numbers of}} nest holes may be seen together. The eggs are white, with typically five to the clutch. Most species are monogamous, and both parents care for the young, sometimes with assistance from related birds in the colony.|$|E
5|$|Pennatomys nivalis was a {{medium-sized}} species without many distinctive adaptations. The nasal bones were short and blunt-ended. The zygomatic plate, a bony plate <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the skull, was broad. The bony palate {{was long and}} flat. The root of the lower incisor was housed in a bony protuberance, the capsular process. The molars were low-crowned and possess accessory crests such as mesolophs. The upper molars all had three roots.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{zygomatic}} plates (plates of bone <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the skull) are variable, {{their size}} is generally intermediate for the Akodon boliviensis group and their front margin ranges from straight {{to a little}} concave. The zygomatic notches, projections {{at the front of}} the plates, are better developed than in A.caenosus and A.sylvanus. The incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate) are long, sometimes extending between the first upper molars. Tiny posterolateral palatal pits are located at the back of the palate. The back margin of the palate is squared to rounded, with a spine in the middle (medial process) sometimes present. The opening behind the palate, the mesopterygoid fossa, is of intermediate width, being narrower than in A.sylvanus, A.simulator, and A.budini but broader than in A.caenosus.|$|E
5|$|At that point, Garin was leading, with Émile Georget {{almost two}} hours behind. In the fifth stage, Georget had two flat tires, {{and fell asleep}} when he stopped <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the road to rest; he failed to finish. Thus Garin {{extended}} his lead by winning this stage, carrying nearly three hours' advantage into the final day's racing. Garin had requested other cyclists in the leading group to let him win the stage, but Fernand Augereau refused to do this. Garin then had Lucien Pothier throw down his bicycle in front of Augereau, who fell, and Garin then bent Augereau's rear wheel. Augereau quickly obtained a spare bike and continued to the finish, however Garin easily won the sprint. Augereau still received a prize of 100 francs from Velo-Sport Nantes for the fastest final kilometer of the stage in the Nantes velodrome.|$|E

The section climbed to high altitude to meet the enemy aircraft. In the ensuing battle it is believed McKellar was shot down by II./Jagdgeschwader 27 (JG 27—Fighter Wing 27) Hauptmann (Captain) Wolfgang Lippert.

5|$|Her uncle Ásmundr {{probably}} {{died in the}} Battle of Fýrisvellir, in the 980s, and it {{was probably}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> king Eric the Victorious. Özurr had entered into {{the service of a}} more powerful liege and died for the Byzantine Emperor. Halfdan may have died either on Bornholm or in a holmgang, whereas where Kári died remains uncertain. The most likely interpretation may be that he died on Od, the old name for the north-western cape of Zealand, but {{it is also possible that}} it was at Dundee in Scotland. Búi's location of death is not given, but Larsson (2002) comments that it was probably in a way that was not considered as glorious as those of his brothers.|$|E
5|$|In {{locations}} where both snake and salamander co-exist, the snakes have developed immunity through genetic changes and they {{feed on the}} amphibians with impunity. Coevolution occurs with the newt increasing its toxic capabilities {{at the same rate}} as the snake further develops its immunity. Some frogs and toads are toxic, the main poison glands being <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the neck and under the warts on the back. These regions are presented to the attacking animal and their secretions may be foul-tasting or cause various physical or neurological symptoms. Altogether, over 200 toxins have been isolated from the limited number of amphibian species that have been investigated.|$|E

5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is {{relatively}} long. The nasal and premaxillary bones extend {{in front of}} the incisors, forming a rostral tube, which is shared among oryzomyines only with Handleyomys. The zygomatic notch (a notch formed by a projection {{at the front of the}} zygomatic plate, a bony plate <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the skull) is shallow. The interorbital region (between the eyes) is narrow and long, with the narrowest part towards the front. The crests on the braincase and interorbital region are weakly developed. Eremoryzomys has larger crests on its interorbital region.|$|E
5|$|It was Hamilton's {{teammate}} {{and defending}} race winner Rosberg who topped the time sheets {{at the second}} session on Friday afternoon, setting a 1:12.385 lap time. He led Hamilton by almost half a second, with the two Ferrari cars of Vettel and Räikkönen about a second adrift. Slight rain saw most drivers head out early, but the conditions never became wet enough to require intermediate tyres. After starting on the medium compound tyres, many drivers switched to the softer compound for race simulations, only for the session to be red flagged shortly after when Fernando Alonso spun at turn four, only to pull over <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the road with smoke coming from his car some corners later. Valtteri Bottas was sixth fastest, behind Daniel Ricciardo, suffering a spin at turn nine.|$|E

At some point the Child's nudity was covered up; this overpaint was removed during a late 20th-century restoration. He is intended to represent both the host and Eucharist, common allusions in Early Netherlandish art and reflecting that the panel was intended for the celebration of mass.|$|E

50|$|Zographus oculator {{can reach}} a body length of 25 - 35 mm.

5|$|The {{character}} of this stage changed drastically after the dramatic injury sustained by Pedro Horrillo the day before brought attention to safety conditions on this and other courses in the Giro. With the course passing over numerous different surfaces, including tram tracks and cobblestones, the peloton collectively protested racing this course, and as such it was neutralized, with everyone receiving {{the same time as}} the stage winner and no points were awarded for the points classification as had been planned. There were also parked cars <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the road in many places, forcing the riders into narrow tunnels to get through them.|$|E
5|$|The current Boehm {{key system}} {{consists}} of generally 6 rings, on the thumb, 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th and 6th holes, a register key {{just above the}} thumb hole, easily accessible with the thumb. Above the 1st hole, there is a key that lifts two covers creating the note A in the throat register (high part of low register) of the clarinet. A key <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the instrument {{at the same height}} as the A key lifts only one of the two covers, producing G a semitone lower. The A key can be used in conjunction solely with the register key to produce A/B.|$|E
5|$|The first {{performance}} of Falstaff {{took place at}} La Scala on 9 February 1893. For the first night, official ticket prices were thirty times higher than usual. Royalty, aristocracy, critics and leading figures from the arts all over Europe were present. The performance was a huge success; numbers were encored, {{and at the end}} the applause for Verdi and the cast lasted an hour. That was followed by a tumultuous welcome when the composer, his wife and Boito arrived at the Grand Hotel de Milan. Even more hectic scenes ensued when he went to Rome in May for the opera's premiere at the Teatro Costanzi, when crowds of well-wishers at the railway station initially forced Verdi to take refuge in a tool-shed. He witnessed the performance from the Royal Box <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> King Umberto and the Queen.|$|E

5|$|The main centre for {{administration}} {{was at the}} entrance to the prison, which included the warden's office. The office contained a desk with radio and telegraph equipment, typewriter, and a telephone. The administrative office section also had the offices of the associate warden and secretary, mail desk, captain's desk, a business office, a clerk's office, an accounting office, a control room which was added with modern technology in 1961, the officer's lounge, armory and vault, and a visitation centre and restrooms. The basement of Alcatraz prison contained dungeons and the showers. The main stairway to the dungeon lay along Sunrise Alley <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> A-Block, but the dungeons were also accessible by a staircase in a trapdoor along the corridor of D-Block. All visits to Alcatraz required prior written approval from the warden.|$|E
5|$|The nasal and premaxillary bones do {{not extend}} back beyond {{the point where}} the lacrimal, frontal, and maxillary bones meet. The {{zygomatic}} plate, the flattened front part of the zygomatic arch, is broad and develops a notch at its front end. The plate's back margin is located before the first upper molar. The jugal bone, part of the zygomatic arch, is reduced, as usual in oryzomyines. The sphenopalatine foramen, a foramen (opening) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the skull above the molars, is small; it is much larger in the marsh rice rat. The narrowest part of the interorbital region is towards the front and the edges are lined by prominent shelves. The parietal bones extend to the sides of the braincase. The interparietal bone is narrow and wedge-shaped, so that the parietal and squamosal bones meet extensively.|$|E
5|$|The {{south side}} of the nave is characterised by eight bays with stepped buttresses between them, with aisle windows {{featuring}} reticulated heads. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the south aisle of the sanctuary is Chapter House, a small, square building, of two storeys. It dates to the mid 13th century and is made from Chipping Camden and Bath limestone, with some local red sandstone from Radyr. The octagonal roof was the brainchild of Prichard, though it was lowered in pitch by Pace and later worked on by Donald Buttress. The buttresses of the building are made from ashlar. The seven stained glass roundels are of 16th century Flemish origin. In the interior is a pulpit featuring Moses. Also of note is the St David's Chapel, added by George Pace in 1953–56, which is accessed through the Norman north door of the cathedral.|$|E
