25|$|From 1956 {{there was}} <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> {{the return of}} {{regional}} colour schemes. Most regions adopted a maroon livery which strongly resembled that of the former London Midland and Scottish Railway but the Western Region returned some of its coaches that were used on named express trains to a chocolate/cream scheme {{similar to that used}} by the GWR before nationalisation and from July 1956 the Southern Region began using a 'coaching stock' green that was somewhat darker than the malachite green colour of the old Southern Railway. For cost reasons, liveries were usually changed piecemeal, when coaches came in for scheduled maintenance. Coaches from different regions could also often find themselves coupled together. Due to the consequent muddle of liveries, many trains began to get an untidy if not tatty appearance which added to the run-down image of the railway. The rebranding of British Railways to British Rail on 1 January 1965 was coupled with the introduction of an entirely new national livery.|$|E

25|$|In 1987 the United Nation's World Commission on Environment and Development (the Brundtland Commission), in {{its report}} Our Common Future {{suggested}} that development was acceptable, {{but it must be}} sustainable development that would {{meet the needs of the}} poor while not increasing environmental problems. Humanity’s demand on the planet has more than doubled over the past 45 years as a result of population growth and increasing individual consumption. In 1961 almost all countries in the world had more than enough capacity to meet their own demand; by 2005 the situation had changed radically with many countries able to meet their needs only by importing resources from other nations. <b>A</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> sustainable living by increasing public awareness and adoption of recycling, and renewable energies emerged. The development of renewable sources of energy in the 1970s and '80s, primarily in wind turbines and photovoltaics and increased use of hydroelectricity, presented some of the first sustainable alternatives to fossil fuel and nuclear energy generation, the first large-scale solar and wind power plants appearing during the 1980s and '90s. Also at this time many local and state governments in developed countries began to implement small-scale sustainability policies.|$|E
25|$|As Finance Minister, Netanyahu {{undertook}} {{an economic}} plan {{in order to}} restore Israel's economy from its low point during the Second Intifada. Netanyahu claimed that a bloated public sector and excessive regulations were largely responsible for stifling economic growth. His plan involved <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> more liberalized markets, {{although it was not}} without its critics. He instituted a program to end welfare dependency by requiring people to apply for jobs or training, reduced the size of the public sector, froze government spending for three years, and capped the budget deficit at 1%. The taxation system was streamlined and taxes were cut, with the top individual tax rate reduced from 64% to 44% and the corporate tax rate from 36% to 18%. A host of state assets worth billions of dollars were privatized, including banks, oil refineries, the El Al national airline, and Zim Integrated Shipping Services. The retirement ages {{for both men and women}} were raised, and currency exchange laws were further liberalized. Commercial banks were forced to spin off their long-term savings. In addition, Netanyahu attacked monopolies and cartels to increase competition. As the Israeli economy started booming and unemployment fell significantly, Netanyahu was widely credited by commentators as having performed an 'economic miracle' by the end of his tenure.|$|E

Accompanying him are Sonny Boy Williamson I on harmonica and Alfred Elkins on imitation bass (possibly a washtub bass). Since both songs appeared before recording industry publications began tracking such releases, it is unknown which version was more popular. In 1947, he recorded it for Columbia Records with Williamson and Ransom Knowling on bass and Judge Riley on drums. This version did not reach the Billboard Race Records chart, but represents <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> a more urban blues treatment of the song.|$|E

Dickens went on to criticize the fact that while Belle appears to be [...] "perfect the way she is," [...] the Beast [...] "need to be reformed." [...] Anna E.

[...] Saraiya commended Belle for resisting [...] "her village's expectations of what her life should look like," [...] crediting her with being [...] "the first princess to express some skepticism about married life." [...] While calling Belle's sacrifice [...] "brave," [...] the author also labeled it [...] "not much of a step for womankind," [...] in the end accusing her of falling [...] "for a domineering man."
