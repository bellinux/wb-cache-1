5|$|San Martino saw <b>action</b> <b>at</b> the Battle of Lissa, fought {{during the}} Third Italian War of Independence in 1866. There {{she was in}} the center of the <b>action,</b> <b>at</b> the head of the Italian main body. Of the three ships in her division, San Martino was the only vessel to survive the battle. After the war, the ship's career was uneventful, the result of the {{emergence}} of more modern ironclads and a severe reduction in the Italian naval budget following their defeat at Lissa. She was rebuilt as a central battery ship some time after Lissa, and was modernized again in the late 1880s. The ship was eventually broken up for scrap in 1903.|$|E
