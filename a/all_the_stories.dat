5|$|After the {{decision}} was taken to cancel <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> previously commissioned for Season 23, new stories were sought for the shortened 14 episode series. The plan was for three production blocks, divided up into two four-episode lots and one block of six episodes. Robert Holmes was assigned the opening four-part story and Philip Martin the second four-part story. The final six episodes were to be broken up into three two-part stories.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} {{pre-production}} {{on the third}} series began, Bullen had grown tired of writing the series single-handedly and believed <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> that could be told had been told. ITV were keen {{to increase the number}} of episodes per series to 20 but Granada refused, though did agree to add two more, bringing the total to eight. A writing team of five was assembled, overseen by Bullen. Four of the scriptwriters were deemed not good enough and they parted company with Granada. David Nicholls remained and scripted four of the eight-third series episodes; Bullen wrote the other four and his interest in the series was revived.|$|E

25|$|The {{third and}} final series focused on a {{different}} character each week but with the overlaps creating a more complex layering of the plot, more akin to a one-off episode of a situation comedy (albeit with intertwined plots) than a traditional sketch show.

To some people, Pyramid Head should be in <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> because they do like him." [...] Additionally, the character was portrayed from October 2 to 31, 2009, in the haunted attraction Sinister Pointe, based on Silent Hill, in Orange County, California, United States.|$|E
