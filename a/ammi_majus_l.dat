The seed contains furanocoumarins (Hamerski and Matern 1988), which stimulate pigment production in the skin that is exposed to bright sunlight (Bown 1995, Chevallier 1996). Thus, this specie is one of the richest known sources of linear furocoumarins. This furocoumarins when activated by sunlight acts as bactericidal, herbicidal, fungicidal, mollscicidal, larvicidal, nematicidal, insecticidal, ovicidal and viricidal.

Spring-summer crops were maize (Zea mays L.), soyabean [Glycine max (L.) Merr. ], sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.). Total weed density {{at the end of}} the wheat tillering stage ranged from 2. 5 to 128. 7 plants m- 2 and generally decreased with cropping intensity, although to a differing extent, depending upon rotation. Differences among weed communities of the 12 cropping systems were mostly dependent upon input level. The effect of the preceding crop on the weed flora composition of winter wheat was evident only with reduced herbicide use (low-input systems). Weed species could be ascribed to four categories: (a) species sporadically associated with cropping systems (most of the weeds); (b) species associated with a specific input level (e. g. Papaver rhoeas L. to low and intermediate input levels and Veronica persica Poiret to the high input level); (c) species associated with a specific rotation (e. g. <b>Ammi</b> <b>majus</b> <b>L.</b> to sugar beet -winter wheat); and (d) species associated with specific plots that become important every other year (e. g.

Relevant activities, i. e. psoralen synthase, are induced rapidly from negligible background levels upon elicitation of A. majus cultures with transient maxima at 9 - 10 h and were recovered in labile microsomes. Expressed sequence tags were cloned from elicited Ammi cells by a nested DD-RT-PCR strategy with CYP-specific primers, and full-size cDNAs were generated from those fragments correlated in abundance with the induction profile of furanocoumarin-specific activities. One of these cDNAs representing {{a transcript of}} maximal abundance at 4 h of elicitation was assigned CYP 71 AJ 1. Functional expression in Escherichia coli or yeast cells initially failed but was accomplished eventually in yeast cells after swapping the N-terminal membrane anchor domain with that of CYP 73 A 1. The recombinant enzyme was identified as psoralen synthase with narrow substrate specificity for (+) -marmesin. Psoralen synthase catalyzes a unique carbon-chain cleavage reaction concomitantly releasing acetone by syn-elimination. Related plants, i. e. Heracleum mantegazzianum, are known to produce both linear and angular furanocoumarins by analogous conversion of 8 -prenylumbelliferone via (+) -columbianetin to angelicin, and {{it was suggested that}} angelicin synthase has evolved from psoralen synthase. However, (+) -columbianetin failed as substrate but competitively inhibited psoralen synthase activity. Analogy modeling and docked solutions defined the conditions for high affinity substrate binding and predicted the minimal requirements to accommodate (+) -columbianetin in the active site cavity.

40|$|Caffeine {{is found}} at high {{concentrations}} in tea, coffee, {{soft drinks and}} energy drinks. Daily consumption of caffeinated beverages {{is considered to be}} safe but adverse health effects and deaths have been reported in sensitive or overdosed individuals. A variety of furanocoumarin bioactive has been identified in fruits, spices and herbs from plants in the Apiaceous and Rutaceae families. Since caffeinated beverages are often consumed with food, and both are metabolized by the same CYP 1 A 2 enzyme, we hypothesized metabolic inhibition between caffeine and furanocoumarin-containing food or herbs are common in humans. The goals of this thesis were: (a) to compare the pharmacokinetics of caffeine in humans before and after pre-treatment with a furanocoumarin-containing herb, (b) to elucidate the mechanism(s) of caffeine-herb interaction using in vitro incubations containing pure furanocoumarins and human liver microsomes (HLMs), and (c) to predict in vivo herb-caffeine interactions for humans based on in vitro caffeine metabolism data and in vivo furanocoumarin inhibitor concentrations in the liver. Chapter 1 of this thesis is a brief introduction of caffeine and furanocoumarin-containing food and herbs. In chapter 2, major furanocoumarin bioactives in 29 food and herbs are identified and quantified using gas chromatography mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography. Chapter 3 describes the pharmacokinetics of caffeine in humans after administering 200 mg of caffeine orally before and after pre-treatment with an herbal extract. Caffeine clearance in the volunteers decreased 33. 7 - 77. 3 % with concomitant increases in area-under-the-concentration-time curve after oral consumption of <b>Ammi</b> <b>majus</b> <b>L.,</b> Angelica archangelica L., Angelica pubescens Maxim, Cnidium monnieri (L.)

In addition, there was no evidence that HETM can affect uterine contractility following gestational exposure of rats...|$|R

A análise de variância e o teste Tukey-Kramer revelaram diferença significativa (p &# 60; 0, 001) entre os grupos teste e controle. Foram dosados os teores de compostos fenólicos e flavonóides dos extratos e das frações bioativas. Os resultados sugerem que estes compostos podem estar relacionados ao efeito anticoagulante dos extratos de capuchinha sobre plasma humano. The {{aim of this}} work was to {{evaluate}} the in vitro anticoagulant effect of the benzylisothiocianate, of the extracts of flowers and leaves of nasturtium, Tropaeolum <b>majus</b> <b>L.</b> (Tropaeolaceae), besides the fractions of the leaves extract, through tests of thrombin time (TT) on human plasma. ANOVA and Tukey's test revealed significant (p &# 60; 0. 001) difference among test and control groups. Determinations of flavonoids and total phenolic contents were carried out with extracts and fractions with anti-thrombin effect. The results suggest that flavonoids {{can be related to}} the anticoagulant effect of the nasturtium extracts on human plasma...|$|R

Rigorous work, Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Pharmacy Hradec Králové, 74 pp. Key words: Alzheimer's disease, alkaloids, Chelidonium majus, acetylcholinesterase, biological aktivity. Within the screening {{of plants that}} contain alkaloids inhibiting the {{activity of}} the human erythrocytic acetylcholinesterase Greater celadine (Chelidonium <b>majus</b> <b>L.,</b> Papaveraceae) was studied. 41. 8 kg of the whole dry plant (the aerial part with the roots) served for the isolation of alkaloids. Mixtures of pseudocyanides of benzophenanthridine alkaloids, phenolic bases, and the alkaloids precipitated from either chloroform-soluble or chloroform-insoluble chlorides were obtained from the purified ethanolic extract. My task was to separate bases from the chlorides insoluble in chloroform. Using both column and thin layer chromatography protopine as a base was isolated. The identity of the isolated alkaloid was determined by means of an authentic standard and by comparing its physico-chemical characteristics with the published data. The isolated compound inhibited the human erythrocytic acetylcholinesterase with IC 50 1, 12. 10 - 3 M. Comparing its biological activity with that of [...] ...|$|R
