Base packages consisting of centrifugal compressor(s), gear, motor or gas turbine driver, lube oil tank, <b>and</b> <b>auxiliary</b> <b>equipment</b> require extensive analyses to validate design requirements for service on FPSO vessels. Finite element analyses (FEA) are performed {{to insure that}} stress and displacement criteria are met. This paper discusses loading conditions that are evaluated including package lifting, transportation loads, short circuit torque, and upset loads. Operating load cases are also analyzed, which include dead weight, FPSO motion, rotor unbalance, torque, nozzle, and wind loads. Modal analyses are performed to ensure that predominant package modes do not lie in the run speed range. Rotor unbalance forced response analyses can be performed to ensure that amplitudes at key locations remain within allowable vibration criteria. Typical FEA models and analytical procedures are presented. The use of the analytical results to assist in selecting design modifications is discussed.

40|$|For {{integrated}} resource planning, {{electric utilities}} require {{estimates of the}} technical and economic conservation potential. This potential depends upon the efficiencies of existing equipment, as well as efficiencies and costs of new equipment. The industrial conservation potential is generally concentrated in machine drive: electric motors <b>and</b> the various <b>auxiliary</b> technologies (pumps, fians, etc.) and process technologies (grinders, saws, etc.) {{to which they are}} connected. Most studies of industry focus on the potential due to more efficient motors and electronic adjustable speed drives.

5000|$|The {{origins of}} {{electromechanical}} inverters explain {{the source of}} the term inverter. Early AC-to-DC converters used an induction or synchronous AC motor direct-connected to a generator (dynamo) so that the generator's commutator reversed its connections at exactly the right moments to produce DC. A later development is the synchronous converter, in which the motor and generator windings are combined into one armature, with slip rings at one end and a commutator at the other and only one field frame. The result with either is AC-in, DC-out. With an M-G set, the DC can be considered to be separately generated from the AC; with a synchronous converter, in a certain sense it can be considered to be [...] "mechanically rectified AC". Given the right <b>auxiliary</b> <b>and</b> control <b>equipment,</b> an M-G set or rotary converter can be [...] "run backwards", converting DC to AC. Hence an inverter is an inverted converter.|$|R
