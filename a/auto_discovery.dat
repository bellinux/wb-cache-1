50|$|Many {{organizations}} create network maps {{of their}} network system. These maps {{can be made}} manually using simple tools such as Microsoft Visio, or the mapping process can be simplified by using tools that integrate <b>auto</b> network <b>discovery</b> with Network mapping. Many of the vendors from the Notable network mappers list enable you to customize the maps and include your own labels, add un-discoverable items and background images. Sophisticated mapping is used to help visualize the network and understand relationships between end devices and the transport layers that provide service. Items such as bottlenecks and root cause analysis can be easier to spot using these tools.|$|R
40|$|Today, Lady Lovelace is {{recognized}} as the first computer programmer – for an algorithm she co-authored with inventor Charles Babbage in 1843. She has also become, per biographer Betty Toole, a “modern myth,” whose very ambiguity and otherness encourage readers’ self-invention around gender and tech, human-machine interactions, and female sexuality. Her life has inspired an eclectic cultural afterlife, ranging from operas and plays to steampunk fashion and even an eponymous underwear collection. One such contemporary artifact is Sydney Padua’s web comic “ 2 -D Goggles,” which playfully re-imagines Lovelace and Babbage as a Victorian crime-fighting duo. This paper examines how Padua’s comic both comments on – and creates – new publics around Lovelace. Despite its fictional premise, the comic blurs the lines between fantasy and biography, grounding its plots and dialogue in primary documents. Through its recursive structure – the feedback loop between Padua’s panels and hypertextual footnotes – “ 2 -D Goggles” reveals the processes by which contemporary publics have shaped Lovelace’s story. At the same time, its form has an invitational quality, engaging readers in an emergent act of (<b>auto)</b> biographical <b>discovery.</b> Padua’s work ultimately illuminates broader questions about comics, life writing, and reading publics. Why is the comics medium so adept at immersing readers in life-writing practices, at linking an individual life with a collective story? What makes certain lives conducive to generating new publics? Does Ada’s anachronism, her lack of fit with her own time, make her paradoxically a more resonant figure in ours...|$|R

Current techniques for manually maintaining these associations are complex, tedious, and error prone. One possible approach is to widen the interfaces between layers to support <b>auto</b> <b>discovery.</b> We argue instead that it is less useful to export additional data between layers than to import information into a separate management plane. The specification of a management interface enables independent evolution of individual layers, side-stepping the challenges inherent in wide layer interfaces. Further, the management plane can leverage network-wide crosslayer visibility to provide enhanced services that depend on physical- or link-layer diversity. ...|$|E

To add the mobility behavior in PSTN phone, a research to develop Android based PSTN phone is needed. Android based device will act as a remote control for the PSTN phone and {{can be used to make}} and accept a call from distance. This paper elaborates the Android based PSTN phone design. To test the system performance, two parts of testing are performed. First is testing the Android based PSTN phone remote control system and second is testing the digital voice streaming system between Android device and minimum system using UDP protocol over wireless computer network. PSTN phone remote control system is tested for its functionality while digital voice streaming system is tested for its quality by giving a sinusoidal signal to the system and comparing the input signal with output signal using oscilloscope. According to the test, Android based PSTN phone prototype is able to make a connection and disconnection of Android device (as client) with microcontroller (as server), make a connection with <b>auto</b> server <b>discovery</b> system, make a call, receive a call, and use redial and hold functions with 100 % success rate in certain condition. However, it is shown that the quality of voice sent from Android phone to Arduino module is poor due to the limited size of buffer in Arduino, but on the other way around the quality of voice sent from Arduino to Android phone is good...|$|R

This work also explores the use of a subject as a means to finding a working process and its importance in that <b>discovery.</b> <b>Auto</b> racing motivated me to study photography, thus the use of automobile culture, with an emphasis on the subculture of auto racing is a key element in this work. Juxtaposing unrelated materials and imagery was a new experience. As I worked, the evolving imagery revealed new meaning which in turn led to new combinations of imagery and material. Auto racing was both the personal connection which allowed me to work and the connection to the discovery of my working process. In the same way the work challenges the audience to embrace a new aesthetic experience not usually associated with contemporary car culture. The key to this body of work is 2 ̆ 2 process. 2 ̆ 2 It is a process which offers no solutions or judgments. Its importance is in the commitment to the act of creating, embracing the journey rather than focusing on the destination. Driving the track...|$|R
30|$|Another trend {{which is}} clear from Figure 4 is the shift from tools utilising a pull {{mechanism}} for collecting monitoring data to using a push model. This represents a move from tight coupling and manual configuration to loosely coupled tools which perform <b>auto</b> <b>discovery</b> and handle membership change gracefully. Pull mechanism provided a means for centralised monitoring servers to control {{the rate at which}} data was collected and control the volume of information produced at any given time. Push mechanism dispense with that means of control and either require an additional feedback mechanism to reintroduce this functionality or require the monitoring system to cope with variable and uncontrolled rates of monitoring data.|$|E

Current techniques for manually maintaining these associations are complex, tedious, and error-prone. One possible approach is to widen the interfaces between layers to support <b>auto</b> <b>discovery.</b> We argue instead that it is less useful to export additional data between layers than to import information into a separate, logically centralized management database. The specification of an interface to this database enables independent evolution of individual layers, side-stepping the challenges inherent in wide layer interfaces.

Some of the common managed VPN services known today include <b>auto</b> <b>discovery,</b> security, and also a potential ability to perform on demand signaling. In this paper we try to tackle an important problem of service providers namely topology dissemination to VPN customers seeking dynamic bandwidth service. Topology dissemination can easily be translated into a VPN service. In this regard we define this service and its associated SLA. Further we elaborate on four basic QoS enabled topology abstraction services: fully meshed, source rooted star, star, and simple node. The paper also describes a generic framework to generate these abstractions and presents simulation results comparing performance {{of each of these}} schemes...|$|E
40|$|Non-intrusive remote {{monitoring}} of data centre services should be {{such that it}} does not require (or minimal) modification of legacy code and standard practices. Also, allowing third party agent to sit on every server in a data centre is a risk from security perspective. Hence, use of standard such as SNMPv 3 is advocated in this kind of environment. There are many tools (open source or commercial) available which uses SNMP; but we observe that most of the tools do not have an essential feature for auto-discovery of network. In this paper we present an algorithm for {{remote monitoring}} of services in a data centre. The algorithm has two stages: 1) <b>auto</b> <b>discovery</b> of network topology and 2) data collection from remote machine. Further, we compare SNMP with WBEM and identify some other options for remote monitoring of services and their advantages and disadvantages...|$|E

Some of the more common managed VPN services known today include <b>auto</b> <b>discovery,</b> security and also a potential ability to perform on demand signaling. In this paper we try to tackle an important problem of service providers providing bandwidth service on demand on an IP/MPLS core network. We propose a managed VPN architecture for such a service highlighting the novelty in our architecture. We concentrate on {{an important aspect of}} service definition called the topology abstraction service and define a new problem called the VPN core capacity sharing problem that arises in this context. We propose three schemes to solve this problem borrowing established results from graph theory. As part of our simulation study, we evaluate each of these strategies with different call arrival scenarios and present their results...|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} {{and efficiency of}} organizations depends on the correct handling of its assets, especially those {{that are used to}} provide services to customers or those that are vital to the smooth running of the business. ITIL v 3 expressly recognises the value of assets for service management, expanding the scope of configuration management and the CMDB tools which support service management processes. The paper describes the scope of asset management and configuration management, both closely linked in, and being part of a comprehensive knowledge management. We describe an approach to draw up an asset and configuration management process based on the automation of the various stages of these processes, which reduces the risks of their implementation. The steps to automate include the <b>auto</b> <b>discovery</b> of assets and configuration elements, and the synchronization and reconciliation of the different sources of data, both key steps previous to provide support to the other various service management processes...|$|E
