5|$|Climate {{change and}} weather-related natural {{disasters}} also threaten lemur survival.

There are indications that deforestation and forest fragmentation are accelerating this gradual desiccation. The effects of drought <b>are</b> <b>even</b> felt in the rainforests. As annual rainfall decreases, the larger trees that make up the high canopy suffer increased mortality, failure to fruit, and decreased production of new leaves, which folivorous lemurs prefer. Cyclones can defoliate an area, knock down canopy trees, and create landslides and flooding. This can leave lemur populations without fruit or leaves until the following spring, requiring them to subsist on crisis foods, such as epiphytes.|$|E
