40|$|Ecosystems {{and other}} {{naturally}} resilient systems exhibit allometric scaling {{in the distribution}} of sizes of their elements. In this paper we define an allometry inspired <b>scaling</b> <b>indicator</b> for cities that is a first step towards quantifying the resilience borne of a complex systems' hierarchical structural composition. The <b>scaling</b> <b>indicator</b> is calculated using large census datasets and is analogous to fractal dimension in spatial analysis. Lack of numerical rigor and the resulting variation in <b>scaling</b> <b>indicators</b> -inherent in the use of box counting mechanism for fractal dimension calculation for cities- {{has been one of the}} hindrances in the adoption of fractal dimension as an urban indicator of note. The intra-urban <b>indicator</b> of <b>scaling</b> in population density distribution developed here is calculated for 58 US cities using a methodology that produces replicable results, employing large census-block wise population datasets from the 2010 US Census 2010 and the 2007 US Economic Census. We show that rising disparity -as measured by the proposed indicator of population density distribution in census blocks in metropolitan statistical areas (using US Census 2010 data) adversely affects energy consumption efficiency and carbon emissions in cities and leads to a higher urban carbon footprint. We then define a planning plane as a visual and analytic tool for incorporation of <b>scaling</b> <b>indicator</b> analysis into policy and decision-making...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} {{a system for}} multi-scale change {{detection}} with <b>automatic</b> <b>scale</b> selection is proposed. The generation of the multi-scale data set is performed based on the fractal net evolution approach (FNEA). The set of scales used by FNEA are optimally selected from the scale domain ensuring that the selected levels present a good enough representation of the scale domain. A pattern search module is used to select good enough set of scales with the least redundancy. The change detection is performed on each scale individually. For each individual object in a specific <b>scale</b> change <b>indicators</b> are extracted for the pixels corresponding to this object in the base-scale images. After extracting the change <b>indicators</b> for each <b>scale,</b> the extracted <b>indicators</b> are thresholded to obtain a per-scale binary change map. To obtain the final change map, a scale-driven fusion of all the extracted change maps is performed. The fusion is based on detecting for each pixel the preferred scale to obtain its change information. The best scale for an object is the scale where the object area keeps static/almost static while moving from one scale to the next scale(s). The proposed system proves advantageous over other change detection systems...|$|R

We propose Make Your Service Elastic (MYSE), an architecture for <b>automatic</b> <b>scaling</b> of generic replicated services based on queuing models for accurate response time estimation.

40|$|Scale-invariant {{feature is}} an {{effective}} method for retrieving and classifying images. In this study, we analyze a scale-invariant planar curve features for developing 2 D shapes. Scale-space filtering is used to determine contour structures on different scales. However, {{it is difficult to}} track signif-icant points on different scales. In mathematics, curvature is considered to be fundamental feature of a planar curve. However, the curvature of a digitized planar curve depends on a <b>scale.</b> Therefore, <b>automatic</b> <b>scale</b> detection for cur-vature analysis is required for practical use. We propose a technique for achieving <b>automatic</b> <b>scale</b> detection based on difference of curvature. Once the curvature values are nor-malized with regard to the scale, we can calculate difference in the curvature values for different scales. Further, an ap-propriate scale and its position are detected simultaneously, thereby avoiding tracking problem. Appropriate scales and their positions can be detected with high accuracy. An ad-vantage of the proposed method is that the detected signif-icant points {{do not need to be}} located in the same contour.

40|$|Abstract — Existing {{methods for}} local area service {{discovery}} either don’t scale or {{rely on a}} trustworthy directory server; in some environments these restrictions are unacceptable or impractical. This paper describes “Repeat-BAND ” a generic method for service discovery that scales automatically without depending on any central component. The <b>automatic</b> <b>scaling</b> makes it fast on small networks and automatically load controlled on large networks, irrespective {{of the number of}} simultaneous discoveries taking place. It is generic {{in the sense that the}} <b>automatic</b> <b>scaling</b> technique can be applied to improve any particular service discovery system, and it is applicable across a large variety of types of network because we show how all the tuning parameters are derived. We present results showing controlled load discovery with scalability up to very large networks. We also show that the algorithms are simple and easy to implement; an important practical requirement since the method is used in Windows Vista and licensed by many hardware vendors. In addition, we consider the industrial requirement as to the certification of independent implementations, an aspect normally ignored in the academic literature.
