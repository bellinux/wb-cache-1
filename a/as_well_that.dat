5|$|Exactly who Ælfgar {{received}} {{aid from}} in the Irish Sea region is uncertain. It is conceivable that, after his flight from England in 1055, Ælfgar was outfitted in Dublin, then ruled by Murchad (with Diarmait as overlord). Likewise, since Diarmait's forces had previously driven Echmarcach from Dublin in 1052, and apparently from Mann in 1061, the joint campaign of Ælfgar and Magnús in 1058which utilised Islesmen and Dublinerscould well have involved Diarmait's cooperation <b>as</b> <b>well.</b> <b>That</b> being said, {{there are several reasons}} to doubt a part played by Diarmait in Ælfgar's military undertakings. For instance, Diarmait seems to have lent assistance to Ælfgar's enemiesthe Godwinsonsin the 1050s and 1060s. Diarmait also appears to have previously backed Cynan ab Iago (fl. 1064), a man who was a bitter rival and seemingly the eventual slayer of Ælfgar's ally and son-in-law, Gruffudd ap Llywelyn.|$|E

5|$|The Wall Street Journal conjectured <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> Germany {{could return}} to the Deutsche Mark, or create another {{currency}} union with the Netherlands, Austria, Finland, Luxembourg and other European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the Baltics. A monetary union of these countries with current account surpluses would create the world's largest creditor bloc, bigger than China or Japan.

5|$|The {{landscape}} {{takes on}} a more suburban residential character as the freeway approaches the Ann Arbor area.

At the same interchange, a Business US 23 (Bus. US23) designation also follows Washtenaw Avenue to the west; east of US23, M-17 follows Washtenaw Avenue and connects the freeway with Ypsilanti. North of this interchange, US23 crosses the Huron River near the campus of the local community college and continues north to a junction with the M-14 freeway. The two merge and run westward along {{the north side of the}} city before US23 turns north and M-14 curves south.|$|E
