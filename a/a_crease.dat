However, this equivalent form applies only to <b>a</b> <b>crease</b> pattern on a flat piece of paper, whereas the alternating sum form of the condition remains valid for crease patterns on conical sheets of paper with nonzero defect at the vertex.|$|E

500|$|To fold flat, {{the number}} of creases must be even. This follows, for instance, from Maekawa's theorem, which states that {{the number of}} {{mountain}} folds at a flat-folded vertex differs from the number of valley folds [...] by exactly two folds. Therefore, suppose that <b>a</b> <b>crease</b> pattern consists of an even number [...] of creases, and let [...] be the consecutive angles between the creases around the vertex, in clockwise order, starting at any one of the angles. Then Kawasaki's theorem states that the crease pattern may be folded flat if and only if the alternating sum and difference of the angles adds to zero: ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>A</b> palmar <b>crease</b> is <b>a</b> type of <b>crease</b> on the palm. A single {{transverse}} palmar crease {{is sometimes}} associated with Down syndrome. [...] Other types of creases include the Sydney crease and the Suwon, or double transverse palmar crease.|$|R
500|$|Kawasaki's theorem, {{applied to}} each of the {{vertices}} of an arbitrary crease pattern, determines whether the crease pattern is locally flat-foldable, meaning that the part of the crease pattern near the vertex can be flat-folded. However, there exist crease patterns that are locally flat-foldable but that have no global flat folding that works for the whole crease pattern at once. [...] conjectured that global flat-foldability could be tested by checking Kawasaki's theorem at each vertex of <b>a</b> <b>crease</b> pattern, and then also testing bipartiteness of an undirected graph associated with the crease pattern. However, this conjecture was disproven by , who showed that Hull's conditions are not sufficient. More strongly, Bern and Hayes showed that the problem of testing global flat-foldability is NP-complete.|$|E
500|$|An {{alternative}} {{proof of}} sufficiency {{can be used}} to show that there are many different flat foldings. Consider the smallest angle [...] and the two creases on either side of it. Mountain-fold one of these two creases and valley-fold the other, choosing arbitrarily which fold to use for which crease. Then, glue the resulting flap of paper onto the remaining part of the crease pattern. The result of this gluing will be <b>a</b> <b>crease</b> pattern with two fewer creases, on a conical sheet of paper, that still satisfies Kawasaki's condition. Therefore, by mathematical induction, repeating this process will eventually lead to a flat folding. The base case of the induction is a cone with only two creases and two equal-angle wedges, which can obviously be flat-folded by using a mountain fold for both creases. There are two ways to choose which folds to use in each step of this method, and each step eliminates two creases. Therefore, any crease pattern with [...] creases that satisfies Kawasaki's condition has at least [...] different choices of mountain and valley folds that all lead to valid flat foldings.|$|E
500|$|Rendering lead Jessica McMackin {{spoke about}} the use of ray tracing on the film, saying: [...] "In {{addition}} to creating accurate reflections, we used ray tracing to achieve other effects. We were able to use this approach to create accurate shadows, like when there are multiple light sources and {{you want to get a}} feathering of shadows at the edges. Or occlusion, which is the absence of ambient light between two surfaces, like <b>a</b> <b>crease</b> in a shirt. A fourth use is irradiance. An example of this would be if you had a piece of red paper and held it up to a white wall, the light would be colored by the paper and cast a red glow on the wall." [...] Character supervisor Tim Milliron explained that the film uses a ground–locking system that kept the cars firmly planted on the road, saying: [...] "The ground-locking system is one of the things I’m most proud of on this film. In the past, characters have never known about their environment in any way. A simulation pass was required if you wanted to make something like that happen. On Cars, this system is built into the models themselves, and as you move the car around, the vehicle sticks to the ground. It was one of those things that we do at Pixar where we knew going in that it had to be done, but we had no idea how to do it." ...|$|E

500|$|The Atlantic puffin is sturdily {{built with}} a thick-set neck and short wings and tail. It is [...] in length {{from the tip}} of its stout bill to its blunt-ended tail. Its {{wingspan}} is [...] and on land it stands about [...] high. The male is generally slightly larger than the female, but they are coloured alike. The forehead, crown and nape are glossy black, as are the back, wings and tail. A broad black collar extends around the neck and throat. On each side of the head is a large, lozenge-shaped area of very pale grey. These face patches taper to a point and nearly meet {{at the back of the}} neck. The shape of the head creates <b>a</b> <b>crease</b> extending from the eye to the hindmost point of each patch giving the appearance of a grey streak. The eye looks almost triangular in shape because of a small, peaked area of horny blue-grey skin above it and a rectangular patch below. The irises are brown or very dark blue and each has red orbital ring. The underparts of the bird, the breast, belly and undertail coverts, are white. By the end of the breeding season, the black plumage may have lost its shine or even taken on a slightly brownish tinge. The legs are short and set well back on the body giving the bird its upright stance on land. Both legs and large webbed feet are bright orange, contrasting with the sharp black claws.|$|E

2500|$|Before a match begins, the two team captains meet on {{the pitch}} for the toss (of a coin) to {{determine}} which team will bat first. Two batsmen and eleven fielders then enter the field and play begins when {{a member of the}} fielding team, known as the bowler, delivers (i.e., bowls) the ball {{from one end of the}} pitch towards the wicket at the other end, which is guarded by one of the batsmen, known as the striker. In addition to the bowler, the fielding team includes the wicket-keeper, a specialist who stands behind the striker's wicket. The nine other fielders are tactically deployed around the field by their captain, usually in consultation with the bowler. The striker [...] "takes guard" [...] on <b>a</b> <b>crease</b> drawn on the pitch four feet in front of the wicket. His role is to prevent the ball from hitting the stumps by using his bat and, simultaneously, to strike it well enough to score runs. The other batsman, known as the non-striker, waits at the opposite end of the pitch near the bowler. The bowler's objectives are to prevent the scoring of runs and to dismiss the batsman. A dismissed batsman, who is declared to be [...] "out", must leave the field to be replaced by a teammate. An over is a set of six deliveries bowled by the same bowler. The next over is bowled from the other end of the pitch by a different bowler.|$|E

2500|$|If a fielder {{uses the}} ball to remove the bails from either set of stumps whilst the batsmen are running between the wickets (or {{otherwise}} away from the crease {{during the course of}} play), then the batsman (striker or non-striker) is out. The batsman nearest the set of stumps from which the bails were removed, but not actually in safe territory, is given out. If the batsman has any part of his body or his bat (if he is holding it) on the ground behind the line of the crease, then he cannot be run out (except if both batsmen are {{on the same side of}} <b>a</b> <b>crease)</b> i.e. on the line is considered as out; frequently it is a close call whether or not a batsman gained his ground in this way before the bails were removed.

[...] If the bails have already been removed, a fielder can remove a remaining stump by pulling it out or hit out the stump (ensure that the stump is fully out of ground) from the ground with the ball in their hands. [...] A fielder can also [...] "remake" [...] the stumps and remove a stump/bail to effect a run out.|$|E
