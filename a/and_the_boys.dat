5|$|Over {{the next}} few years the {{situation}} deteriorated further. Governor Tryon <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boys</b> exchanged threats, truce offers, and other writings, which were frequently written by Allen in florid and didactic language, while the Boys continued to drive surveyors and incoming tenants on New York-granted lands away. Most of these incidents did not involve bloodshed, although individuals were at times manhandled, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boys</b> sometimes did extensive property damage when driving tenants out. By March 1774, the harsh treatment of settlers and their property by Allen <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boys</b> prompted Tryon to increase some of the rewards to £100.|$|E

5|$|Born {{in rural}} Connecticut, Allen had a {{frontier}} upbringing but also received an education that included some philosophical teachings. In the late 1760s he {{became interested in}} the New Hampshire Grants, buying land there and becoming embroiled in the legal disputes surrounding the territory. Legal setbacks {{led to the formation of}} the Green Mountain Boys, whom Allen led in a campaign of intimidation and property destruction to drive New York settlers from the Grants. When the American Revolutionary War broke out, Allen <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boys</b> seized the initiative and captured Fort Ticonderoga in May 1775. In September 1775 Allen led a failed attempt on Montreal that resulted in his capture by British authorities. First imprisoned aboard Royal Navy ships, he was paroled in New York City, and finally released in a prisoner exchange in 1778.|$|E

5|$|Fruit, {{fish and}} wild pigs provide {{plentiful}} food, {{and at first}} the boys' life on the island is idyllic. They build a shelter and construct a small boat using their only possessions: a broken telescope, an iron-bound oar, and a small axe. Their first contact with other humans comes after several months when they observe two large outrigger canoes in the distance, one pursued by the other. The two groups of Polynesians disembark {{on the beach and}} engage in battle; the victors take fifteen prisoners, and kill and eat one immediately. But when they threaten to kill one of the three women captured, along with two children, the boys intervene to defeat the pursuers, earning them the gratitude of the chief, Tararo.

Yuki takes an early interest in Yoshino when she believes Yoshino to be a boy, though remains on good terms with Yoshino even after learning of Yoshino's assigned sex, and gives Shuichi and Yoshino helpful advice when they are troubled. Despite the differences between their situations, Yuki sees a lot of herself in Shuichi: when they were growing up, Shiina was the only friend who stood by the young Hiroyuki, as she was called then, while girls teased her <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> bullied her to change. Yuki always keeps up a positive attitude, and runs a gay bar. Since her transition, {{she has not been}} on good terms with her parents, who run a uniform store.|$|E
5|$|The Bambers were financially secure. There was the farmhouse, {{property}} in London, 300 {{acres of land}} and a caravan site. Their company, N. and J. Bamber Ltd, was worth ₤400,000 (c.£1,057,000). In her will June left ₤230,000 (c.£608,000 in 2016), and Nevill left ₤380,000 (c.£1,004,000); Bamber was a major beneficiary of both wills. The couple gave the children a good home and private education, but June was intensely religious and tried to force her children and grandchildren to adopt the same ideas. She had a poor relationship with Sheila, who felt June disapproved of her, and June's relationship with Jeremy was so troubled that he had apparently stopped speaking to her. Sheila's ex-husband {{was concerned about the}} effect June was having on his sons. She made them kneel and pray with her, which upset him <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys.</b>|$|E

A nine-to-nine score leads to a lightning round. Monica raises the stakes: If the women win, Joey and Chandler must give up their birds, as the maturing Chick is crowing in the mornings and waking them up. Chandler rebuts by suggesting Rachel and Monica give up their apartment to them, which Monica agrees to without consulting Rachel. The girls lose the lightning round because they cannot identify Chandler's job, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> win.|$|E
5|$|When {{they are}} young, Sam breaks into the orphanage {{he was thrown}} out of to get to Nathan, and tell him some grim news. To make up for the bad part, Sam leads Nathan to the house of Evelyn,a {{historian}} who was legally sold their mother's belongings. They attempt to retrieve the items, but are caught. Evelyn called the police before she knew that the boys were the offspring of Cassandra Morgan, an employee of hers. Evelyn collapses from her lung disease <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> are associated with her death. They flee, and Sam prompts Nathan that they can become explorers, under the new surname of Drake. It is implied that Sam , around 19 or 20 years old was behind bars when Nathan around 14 or 15 years old stole Francis Drake's ring in Columbia, and when he first partnered with Victor Sullivan, he presumably later met Victor but never saw him eye to eye, and distrusted him.|$|E
5|$|While fleeing, Stan {{calls his}} mother, who is too busy protesting Terrance and Phillip {{to listen to}} his problems.

Eventually, the network agrees to take the show off the air, not because of the deaths but because of the stench of the protesters' explosive diarrhea. Meanwhile, Death continues chasing the boys, but stops in front of a television playing Terrance and Phillip. Death <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> start laughing together, but after it is taken off the air, Death angrily touches and kills Kenny. Angered, Grandpa Marvin demands that Death kill him, but Death refuses. Death then brings in the spirit of Stan's great great grandfather (Marvin's grandfather), who was killed by Marvin when he was Stan's age; the ghost warns Marvin that he must die of natural causes and not place the burden of his suicide on anybody else's shoulders or else he will spend his eternity after death in limbo.|$|E

5|$|The {{boys and}} the backpackers visit a water park, where Jay intends to find his ex-girlfriend, Jane. The park staff tell Jay that Jane has found a new job in the vast Outback, which leaves Jay feeling very dejected. Lucy tells Simon via Skype that Jane {{is working on a}} stud farm in the remote {{settlement}} of Birdsville, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> intend to drive there. Their car runs out of petrol {{in the middle of the}} desert. The group hold hands together as they realise that they will most likely die, but are rescued by Jane and her co-workers. She realises how far Jay came to win her over again, and although she is touched by the gesture, she does not take him back. Back at Jay's uncle's house, the boys find that their parents have travelled to find them after hearing of their near-death experience. The boys are shocked to find Mr Gilbert (their old head of sixth form and Will's nemesis) there too, and Will's mother announces that she and Gilbert are in a relationship, to the abject horror of Will and amusement of the other three friends. Over Skype, Lucy breaks-up with Simon because she is now in a relationship with his university 'best friend' Pete, which Simon responds to by cheering and abruptly hanging-up on her.|$|E
5|$|While Parke's {{conviction}} cleared Euston, another {{trial began}} on 16 December 1889 when Newlove's and Somerset's solicitor, Arthur Newton, {{was charged with}} obstruction of justice. It was alleged that he conspired to prevent Hammond <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> from testifying by offering or giving them passage and money to go abroad. Newton was defended by Charles Russell, who had prosecuted Ernest Parke, and the prosecutor was Sir Richard Webster, the Attorney General. Newton pleaded guilty {{to one of the}} six charges against him, claiming that he had assisted Hammond to flee merely to protect his clients, who were not at that time charged with any offence or under arrest, from potential blackmail. The Attorney General accepted Newton's pleas and did not present any evidence on the other five charges. On 20 May, the judge, Sir Lewis Cave, sentenced Newton to six weeks in prison, which was widely considered by members of the legal profession to be harsh. A petition signed by 250 London law firms was sent to the Home Secretary, Henry Matthews, protesting at Newton's treatment.|$|E
