5|$|As Hammurabi was {{assisted}} {{during the}} war in the south by his allies from the north such as Yamhad and Mari, the absence of soldiers in the north led to unrest. Continuing his expansion, Hammurabi turned his attention northward, quelling the unrest and soon after crushing Eshnunna. Next the Babylonian armies conquered the remaining northern states, including Babylon's former ally Mari, although {{it is possible that the}} 'conquest' of Mari was a surrender without <b>any</b> <b>actual</b> conflict.|$|E
5|$|Bart enlists Nelson's {{other victims}} in his army and trains them for combat. Herman {{commands}} from Bart's treehouse as Bart leads his forces into battle. Ambushing Nelson and his sidekicks, they commence saturation bombing with water balloons. Nelson's thugs surrender, and Nelson is taken prisoner. He threatens {{to beat up}} Bart {{as soon as he}} is untied. Herman drafts the armistice treaty, which states that Nelson will retain his position and name, but will not hold <b>any</b> <b>actual</b> power. Then, Bart and Nelson sign the treaty. Then, Marge enters with cupcakes, and peace prevails.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} what mental element is {{expected}} in cases of trespass to goods; while trespass to the person requires intent, the requirements for trespass to goods have never been tested in court. The common remedy is damages, which may be awarded regardless of if <b>any</b> <b>actual</b> harm is suffered; where there is damage, the defendant will only be liable {{if he could have}} reasonably foreseen it, as in Kuwait Airways Corporation v Iraqi Airways Co (No 5). Valid defences are those of statutory authority, consent, where it is necessary to interfere with the goods, or jus tertii.|$|E

5|$|The {{results were}} applauded by the Senate at first, who {{were glad to}} be rid of the former emperor. But {{tradition}} held that the emperor could only be selected from among the Senate; moreover, Macrinus {{was a member of the}} equestrian class, the lower of the two aristocratic classes. These disadvantages led the Senate to severely scrutinize his every action. Their opposition, however, was not backed by <b>any</b> <b>actual</b> power. The military at the time was concentrated against the Parthians in the area around Edessa (modern Şanlıurfa, Turkey), so there was no force anywhere in the Empire that could contest the status of Macrinus.|$|E
5|$|Ashmole {{supported}} {{the side of}} Charles I in the Civil War. At the outbreak of fighting in 1642, he left London for the house of his father-in-law, Peter Mainwaring of Smallwood, Cheshire. There he lived a retired life until 1644, when he was appointed King's Commissioner of Excise at Lichfield. Soon afterwards, {{at the suggestion of}} George Wharton, a leading astrologer with strong court connections, Ashmole was given a military post at Oxford, where he served as an ordnance officer for the King's forces. In his spare time, he studied mathematics and physics at his lodgings, Brasenose College. There he acquired a deep interest in astronomy, astrology, and magic. In late 1645, he left Oxford to accept the position of Commissioner of Excise at Worcester. Ashmole was given the additional military post of captain in Lord Astley's Regiment of Foot, part of the Royalist Infantry, though as a mathematician, he was seconded to artillery positions. He seems never to have participated in <b>any</b> <b>actual</b> fighting.|$|E
5|$|Henry the Young King {{fought a}} short war {{with his brother}} Richard in 1183 over the status of England, Normandy and Aquitaine. Henry II moved in support of Richard, and Henry the Young King died from {{dysentery}} {{at the end of}} the campaign. With his primary heir dead, Henry rearranged the plans for the succession: Richard was to be made King of England, albeit without <b>any</b> <b>actual</b> power until the death of his father; Geoffrey would retain Brittany; and John would now become the Duke of Aquitaine in place of Richard. Richard refused to give up Aquitaine; Henry II was furious and ordered John, with help from Geoffrey, to march south and retake the duchy by force. The two attacked the capital of Poitiers, and Richard responded by attacking Brittany. The war ended in stalemate and a tense family reconciliation in England at the end of 1184.|$|E

50|$|In 2003, the Department of Justice created LifeAndLiberty.gov, {{a website}} that {{supported}} the USA PATRIOT Act.

The website has since been taken offline.|$|R
5|$|The far-infrared (24–70μm) and {{submillimeter}} (70–500μm) photometry {{performed by}} Spitzer and Herschel telescopes {{revealed that the}} surface of Makemake is not homogeneous. Although the majority of it is covered by nitrogen and methane ices, where the albedo ranges from 78 to 90%, there are small patches of dark terrain whose albedo is only 2 to 12%, and that make up 3–7% of the surface. These studies were made before S/2015 (136472) 1 was discovered; thus, these small dark patches may actually have been the dark surface of the satellite rather than <b>any</b> <b>actual</b> surface features on Makemake. However, another experiment has refuted these studies. Between 2006 and 2013, the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo acquired new visible and near infra-red spectra for Makemake that covered nearly 80% of its surface; this {{study found that the}} variation in the spectra were negligible, suggesting that Makemake's surface may indeed be homogenous.|$|E
5|$|The trailer was {{designed}} to be emotional, allowing players to care for the characters and to be distinct from trailers for the game's competitors. The trailer does not show <b>any</b> <b>actual</b> gameplay, instead telling a short story about the game's world and the background behind its events. The development team also had the goal to show the inevitability and the helplessness of a family in a zombie outbreak. Upon its release on February 16, 2011, the trailer sparked public interest, and the community reaction led Techland to adjust the content of the actual game. It was met with a mixed reception from critics. Praise was directed at the trailer's new ideas, story, immersion and tone, however, it received criticism for lacking gameplay information and its depiction of a dead child. The trailer received multiple awards upon release.|$|E
5|$|Square {{accumulated}} four SGI Origin 2000 series servers, four Onyx2 systems, and 167 Octane workstations for the film's production. The basic {{film was}} rendered at a custom render farm created by Square in Hawaii. It housed 960 Pentium III-933MHz workstations. Character movements were filmed using motion capture technology. Animator Matthew Hackett stated that while motion capture was effective {{for many of}} the scenes, in others animators still had to add movements manually. Hand and facial movements were all done manually. Some of General Hein's facial features and poses were based on Hackett. As animators did not want to use <b>any</b> <b>actual</b> photographs in the film, all backgrounds were done using matte paintings. 1,327 scenes in total needed to be filmed to animate the digital characters. The film consists of 141,964 frames, with each frame taking an average of 90 minutes to render. By the end of production Square had a total of 15 terabytes of artwork for the film. It is estimated that over the film's four-year production, approximately 200 people put in a combined 120 years of work on it.|$|E

5|$|William ceased his active {{service in}} the Royal Navy in 1790. When Britain {{declared}} war on France in 1793, he was anxious to serve his country and expected a command, but was not given a ship, perhaps at first because he had broken his arm by falling down some stairs drunk, but later perhaps because he gave a speech in the House of Lords opposing the war. The following year he spoke in favour of the war, expecting a command after his change of heart; none came. The Admiralty did not reply to his request. He did not lose hope of being appointed to an active post. In 1798 he was made an admiral, but the rank was purely nominal. Despite repeated petitions, he was never given a command throughout the Napoleonic Wars. In 1811, he {{was appointed to the}} honorary position of Admiral of the Fleet. In 1813, he came nearest to <b>any</b> <b>actual</b> fighting, when he visited the British troops fighting in the Low Countries. Watching the bombardment of Antwerp from a church steeple, he came under fire, and a bullet pierced his coat.|$|E
5|$|With {{his eldest}} son dead, Henry rearranged {{the plans for the}} succession: Richard was to be made king of England, albeit without <b>any</b> <b>actual</b> power until the death of his father; Geoffrey would have to retain Brittany, as he held it by marriage, so Henry's {{favourite}} son John would become the duke of Aquitaine in place of Richard. Richard, however, refused to give up Aquitaine; he was deeply attached to the duchy, and had no desire to exchange this role for the meaningless one of being the junior King of England. Henry was furious, and ordered John and Geoffrey to march south and retake the duchy by force. The short war ended in stalemate and a tense family reconciliation at Westminster in England at the end of 1184. Henry finally got his own way in early 1185 by bringing Eleanor to Normandy to instruct Richard to obey his father, while simultaneously threatening to give Normandy, and possibly England, to Geoffrey. This proved enough and Richard finally handed over the ducal castles in Aquitaine to Henry.|$|E
5|$|The {{result was}} a {{sequence}} of innovative but unpopular financial measures. John levied scutage payments eleven times in his seventeen years as king, as compared to eleven times in total {{during the reign of}} the preceding three monarchs. In many cases these were levied in the absence of <b>any</b> <b>actual</b> military campaign, which ran counter to the original idea that scutage was an alternative to actual military service. John maximised his right to demand relief payments when estates and castles were inherited, sometimes charging enormous sums, beyond barons' abilities to pay. Building on the successful sale of sheriff appointments in 1194, John initiated a new round of appointments, with the new incumbents making back their investment through increased fines and penalties, particularly in the forests. Another innovation of Richard's, increased charges levied on widows who wished to remain single, was expanded under John. John continued to sell charters for new towns, including the planned town of Liverpool, and charters were sold for markets across the kingdom and in Gascony. The king introduced new taxes and extended existing ones. The Jews, who held a vulnerable position in medieval England, protected only by the king, were subject to huge taxes; £44,000 was extracted from the community by the tallage of 1210; much of it was passed on to the Christian debtors of Jewish moneylenders. John created a new tax on income and movable goods in 1207 – effectively a version of a modern income tax – that produced £60,000; he created a new set of import and export duties payable directly to the crown. John found that these measures enabled him to raise further resources through the confiscation of the lands of barons who could not pay or refused to pay.|$|E
