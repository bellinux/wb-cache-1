50|$|La Palabra fully {{returned}} to his Cuban roots in 2009 {{with the release of}} Musicholic. The music he had been writing since meeting Mel Morrow was increasingly heavily influenced by the eclectic rhythms and musical styles he heard as a child and adolescent, as well as the more modern Latin jazz he heard <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>teen-ager</b> in New York and Detroit. His sophisticated style of Afro-Cuban jazz, while unmistakably his own, is in the tradition of Maraca, Mario Bauza and his Afro-Cuban Orchestra, Bebo Valdés, Poncho Sanchez, Oscar D'León, Chucho Valdés (the founder and musical director of Irakere, Cuba's top jazz orchestra), Jerry Gonzalez's Fort Apache jazz group from the late 1970s, early innovator Machito, the spirit of experimentation of Pucho and His Latin Brothers' acid-jazz from the late 1960s, Ray Barretto, and even hints of classic Eddie Palmieri.|$|E
5000|$|Antonio Salemme (November 2, 1892 − May 2, 1995), Italian-born American {{sculptor}} and painter, is {{best known}} for his sculpted portraits (including; John F. Kennedy, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Albert Einstein, Paul Robeson, Ethel Waters) and classical nudes. After studying in Boston and Rome before World War I, and serving in the Italian army during that conflict, Salemme settled in New York and became a prominent figure in the Greenwich Village cultural scene of the 1920s and 30s. Three of his sculpted portraits (of Robeson, Waters, and Arctic explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson) are in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery. His Kennedy portrait is at the John F. Kennedy Library. Salemme's life-size nude of Paul Robeson entitled [...] "Negro Spiritual" [...] (1926) was exhibited to acclaim in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Paris, and became a cause celebré when it was banned from an exhibition in Philadelphia in 1930. Salemme was the recipient of two Guggenheim Fellowships (1932 and 1936). In the 1940s he became increasingly interested in painting, which he had studied <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>teen-ager.</b> Salemme's Annual summer visits to Rockport, Massachusetts, resulted in numerous post-Impressionist-inspired sea- and landscapes. After a 43-year career in New York, Salemme and his wife Martha moved to rural eastern Pennsylvania in 1962. Working from memory and imagination, and inspired by Hindu philosophy and his devoted practice of Zen Buddhist meditation, Salemme continued to evolve artistically over the next 30 years, painting and sculpting prolifically almost until his death at age 102. In 2013 an Italian historical society published a selection of Salemme's letters and photographs from his military service in World War I. The artist's work was the subject of a retrospective exhibition at the Sigal Museum in Easton, Pennsylvania in 2014.= ...|$|E

Psychoanalytic theory is used as an interpretive framework and Erik Erikson 2 ̆ 7 s theories regarding the stages of personality development and growth are applied. Basic causes, from the Freudian point of view, of Chou 2 ̆ 7 s impulses towards revolutionary activity are identified. ^ The study opens with an analysis of Chou En-lai 2 ̆ 7 s family background, education and experience <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>teen-ager.</b> His years in Europe, especially France, where he committed himself to communism, are analyzed in detail. Consideration is also given to the background of his wife, Teng Ying-ch 2 ̆ 7 ao, and to their marriage. ^ Chou En-lai 2 ̆ 7 s early political career after he returned to China is emphasized. This includes the period of the first United Front between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party, when Chou was Political Director of the Whampoa Military Academy, Commissioner of the East River District and Political Adviser to the First Division of the National Revolutionary Army, which was commanded by Chiang Kai-shek. It also includes his activities as an underground operative in Shanghai during the period of the breakdown of the alliance. The study concludes with a reconstruction of the Nanch 2 ̆ 7 ang Rebellion of 1927. Chou En-lai {{played a major role in}} that insurrection, which, although a failure at the time, is now regarded as having led to the founding of the Chinese Red Army. ...|$|E
