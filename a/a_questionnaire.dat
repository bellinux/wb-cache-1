5|$|A jury {{consultant}} helped {{pick the}} jury in the O. J. Simpson murder trial. Criminologist Jo-Ellan Dimitrius used surveys to determine the ideal defense juror demographic (black women) and analyzed and judged the prospective jurors' answers to <b>a</b> <b>questionnaire</b> and response and body language during voir dire (the stage of jury selection where lawyers are permitted to directly question the jury). Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi gives more credit to the traditional change of venue. He argues that transferring the case to a section of Los Angeles with more blacks in the jury pool was most detrimental to the selection of a prosecution-friendly jury. Incidentally, the prosecutor fired her court-appointed jury consultant early in the process.|$|E
5|$|Blood {{transfusion}} {{was formerly}} the second-most common {{mode of transmission}} for Chagas disease, but {{the development and implementation}} of blood bank screening tests has dramatically reduced this risk in the 21st century. Blood donations in all endemic Latin American countries undergo Chagas screening, and testing is expanding in countries, such as France, Spain and the United States, that have significant or growing populations of immigrants from endemic areas. In Spain, donors are evaluated with <b>a</b> <b>questionnaire</b> to identify individuals at risk of Chagas exposure for screening tests.|$|E

5|$|Silent Hill: Shattered Memories divides its {{gameplay}} {{between two}} different settings. The first section {{is set in}} a psychotherapist's office and the second in a town called Silent Hill. In the first section, the player interacts with Dr. Michael Kaufmann, a therapist who is a non-player character, from a first-person perspective. The player responds to Kaufmann's questions and completes a psychological test, fills in <b>a</b> <b>questionnaire</b> or colors pictures. The player's responses to these tests alters aspects of gameplay in the second setting, including the available areas, the physical appearance and behavior of characters encountered, and the physical appearance of the monsters. Shattered Memories returns to Kaufmann's office periodically throughout the game.|$|E
5|$|Version 2002 was {{announced}} August 28, 2001. The Family Edition was dropped, so parental controls and information filtering are bundled with this release.

A problem CNET encountered when upgrading from the prior release was {{the loss of}} customized settings. PC Magazine found the default settings, aimed at avoiding frequent notifications, were somewhat permissive. Windows 95 support was also dropped.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{assessed}} the utility and cost-effectiveness {{of using a}} World Wide Web-based <b>questionnaire</b> in <b>a</b> large prospective cohort study, the Black Women's Health Study (BWHS). In 1995, 59, 000 African-American women were recruited into the BWHS through <b>a</b> paper <b>questionnaire.</b> Follow-up paper questionnaires have been mailed every 2 years since then. During the 2003, 2005, and 2007 questionnaire cycles, participants were given the option of completing <b>a</b> Web-based <b>questionnaire.</b> The cost of developing and processing <b>a</b> returned paper <b>questionnaire</b> was 4 times that of <b>a</b> returned Web <b>questionnaire,</b> primarily because of return postage costs and greater processing time for paper questionnaires. The proportion of respondents who completed <b>a</b> Web <b>questionnaire</b> doubled from 2003 to 2007, from 10. 1 % to 19. 9 %, but the characteristics of those completing the Web questionnaire remained the same. Web response was greatest at younger ages (20. 9 % of those aged < 30 years) and declined with age to 3. 6 % among women aged 60 years or more. Web questionnaires were filled out more completely than paper questionnaires, regardless of the sensitivity of a question. The use of <b>a</b> Web <b>questionnaire</b> in the BWHS resulted in cost savings and more complete responses.
