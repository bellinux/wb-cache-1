40|$|Problem statement: Though ethanol and gasohol are {{proved to}} be used as {{alternative}} fuels in vehicles, 4 -stoke motorcycles used nationwide mainly consumed gasoline 91 / 95. Approach: The motorcycle tested, the used Honda Wave 125 model, was properly tuned at the rich relative air-fuel ratio (λ) 0. 85, which theoretically gave the maximum power output. For the use of E 100, the engine required richer air-fuel mixture condition, the main nozzle and idle nozzle sizes were therefore increased from the sizes used for gasoline 91; by 21. 4 % from 0. 78 mm for the main nozzle and 76 % from 0. 35 mm for the idle nozzle. Due to having three times higher in heat of vaporization, the stronger current ignition coil was used instead. This eased the engine starting without any trace amount of gasoline. The ignition timing was advanced by about + 9 Ocrank angle to suit E 100 ’s high octane number of 107. Results: The performance test results of E 100 on dynamometer showed that the maximum power output was 9 hp@ 7428 rpm and the maximum torque was 11 Nm@ 4728 rpm. Comparing to the use of gasoline 91, the engine performance decreased 12 - 15 % over the speed range of around 4000 - 8000 rpm. From the road tests; city road test and long driving test, at the <b>average</b> <b>speed</b> of 60 <b>km</b> <b>h</b> - 1 the average consumption rate of E 100 was about 25 - 28 % more. The calculated fuel conversion efficiency of E 100 was 38. 2 % higher. For emission measurements when using E 100, the concentrations of CO and of HC were 3. 14 vol % and 2143 ppm. Those were higher than in the exhaust of the use of gasoline 91 but below the regulations which required 1. 0 condition. Since a particular instrument was not available, aldehyde concentration in the E 100 ’s emission was not measured. Conclusion: It clearly confirmed that E 100, 95. 5 vol % ethanol, can be effectively used as an alternative fuel in used 4 -stroke motorcycles whose carburetors were purposely designed for the use of gasoline 91. If the engines were properly tuned up and modified to best suit the E 100 ’s characteristics while maintaining the compression ratio, the motorcycles performed as efficient as fueling gasoline 91...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{researchers}} have identified {{significant differences between}} laboratory and road cycling performances. To establish the ecological validity of laboratory time-trial cycling performances, the causes of such differences should be understood. Hence, {{the purpose of the}} present study was to quantify differences between laboratory- and road-based time-trial cycling and to establish to what extent body size [mass (m) and height (h) ] may help to explain such differences. Twenty-three male competitive, but non-elite, cyclists completed two 25 mile time-trials, one in the laboratory using an air-braked ergometer (Kingcycle) and the other outdoors on a local road course over relatively flat terrain. Although laboratory speed was a reasonably strong predictor of road speed (R 2 69. 3 %), a significant 4 % difference (P 5 0. 001) in cycling speed was identified (laboratory vs. road speed: 40. 4 + 3. 02 vs. 38. 7 + 3. 55 <b>km</b> <b>h</b> 71; mean + s). When linear regression was used to predict these differences (Diff) in cycling speeds, the following equation was obtained: Diff (<b>km</b> <b>h</b> 71) 24. 97 0. 0969 m 710. 7 h, R 2 52. 1 % and the standard deviation of residuals about the fitted regression line 1. 428 (<b>km</b> <b>h</b> 71).

40|$|This study {{investigated}} physiological and psychological correlates {{of the positive}} and negative components of a systems model in a well-trained male middle-distance runner. In the systems model, performance at any given point in time is seen as the difference between two antagonistic components, fitness and fatigue, which represent {{the positive and negative}} adaptation to training, respectively. Each component comprises a set of parameters unique to the individual, which were estimated by fitting model-predicted performance to performance measured weekly throughout a 12 -week training period. The model fitness component was correlated with extrapolated VO 2 max (ml. kg 1. min 1), running economy (RE) (VO 2 at 17 <b>km.</b> <b>h</b> 1), and running <b>speed</b> (<b>km.</b> <b>h</b> 1) at ventilatory threshold (VTRS). The model fatigue component was correlated with the fatigue subset of the profile of mood states (POMS). The fit between model and actual performance was signifi- cant (r 2 = 0. 92, P< 0. 01). In the case of fitness, both VTRS (r= 0. 94, P= 0. 0001) and RE (r= 0. 61, P= 0. 04) were significantly correlated with the model fitness component. There was also a moderate correlation between the fatigue subset of the POMS and the fatigue component (r= 0. 75, p< 0. 05).

40|$|Because of the {{important}} role of the Colorado Potato Beetle (CPB) on the economy of potato production in most countries, a review of different methods of the insect control, especially mechanical approaches, has been done. Over the years, CPB has become resistant to most of the chemical pesticides and moreover, heavy application of these chemicals has lead to serious environmental problems.

40|$|Many {{researches}} in {{the world}} deal with driving {{on the road to}} ensure optimum safety. In this context, several telecommunication technologies are often used to connect the vehicles via continuous wireless communication with the infrastructure, exchange data and information relevant to increase overall road safety and enable cooperative traffic management. These systems are not reliable for all situations and the difficulties encountered by the drivers. We have been proposed the Multi-band Orthogonal Frequency- Division Multiplexing system based on Ultra Wide Band (MB-OFDM UWB) as a good candidate to insure a Vehicle to Infrastructure (V 2 I) communication with high data rate and good performances in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER). However, Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI) resulting from Doppler shift phenomenon degrades MB-OFDM UWB system performance and raises a significant challenge in wireless mobile environment. In this study, V 2 I communication based on the MB-OFDM UWB technology is studied and analyzed for 200 Mbit/s, over multipath channel using the IEEE 802. 15. 4 a channel model with Doppler shift for different speeds. The theoretical formulas of BER in Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh channels are calculated and are compared to the simulation results in MB-OFDM UWB system. The comparison shows that simulation results are consistent with theoretical formulas. The degradation in the performance of the proposed system solution becomes worse with a high <b>speed</b> 250 <b>Km</b> <b>h</b> - 1, so itâs necessary to use new receiver solutions.

40|$|Locomotor {{mode and}} the maximal {{capacity}} for aerobic metabolism {{are thought to}} be co-adapted in anuran amphibians. Species that rely heavily on walking often have high capacities for aerobic metabolism relative to species that rely primarily on saltation. We tested the hypothesis of co-adaptation of gait and aerobic metabolism by investigating the locomotor energetics of Bufo boreas halophilus, a toad that walks, but does not hop. Rates of oxygen consumption during locomotion were measured in an enclosed variable-speed treadmill. The steady-state rate of oxygen consumption (V˙O•ss) increased linearly within a range of sustainable speeds [V˙O•ss (ml O 2 g 21 h 21) = 0. 93 3 <b>speed</b> (<b>km</b> <b>h</b> 21) + 0. 28]. The minimum cost of transport, Cmin (the slope of this relationship), varied significantly among individual toads. When expressed in units of oxygen consumed per distance travelled (ml O 2 km 21), Cmin scaled isometrically with body mass: Cmin = 0. 69 mass 1. 07. Consequently, mass-specific Cmin (ml O 2 g 21 km 21) was uncorrelated with body mass. Variation in Cmin was also unrelated to experimental temperature. Mass-specific Cmin estimates were similar to previous allometric predictions for terrestrial animals of similar size, which contrasts with previous findings for another toad species. Maximum rates of oxygen consumption measured in closed, rotating respirometers were significantly higher than the maximum rates achieved on the treadmill, but lower than those measured previously in other Bufo species. Our results indicate that walking is not necessarily a costly gait for toads and that high maximum rates of oxygen consumption are not associated with reliance on walking within the genus Bufo...|$|R

Accordingly, wind-assisted mouth cooling should be utilized by resting pigeons, since exposure to a slight breeze (approximately 10 <b>km</b> <b>h</b> 21) could augment their dissipating power by an amount equivalent to their resting metabolic rate.
