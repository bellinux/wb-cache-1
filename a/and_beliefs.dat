We argue that the obtained generalized Kripke models might be useful for carefully distinguishing the many different notions of knowledge <b>and</b> <b>belief.</b> We identify the (highly idealized) notions of objective knowledge <b>and</b> rational (introspective) <b>belief,</b> which correspond with fairly standard notions of knowledge <b>and</b> <b>belief,</b> <b>and</b> propose a system OKRIB for combining both notions which differs essentially from some other such proposals found in the literature. We also consider some other notions of knowledge <b>and</b> <b>belief,</b> <b>and</b> study how they relate to objective knowledge <b>and</b> rational <b>belief...</b>|$|R

In this indicative qualitative case study, we observed six important features in relation to religion and belief: a clear divide in attitudes to the place of religion <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> between operations <b>and</b> curriculum; a lack of knowledge and understanding of the religious landscape within the institution; differing and localized responses to religion <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> within <b>and</b> between departments; variation in the approaches of different academic disciplines; very strong desire to promote a good student experience, which included a recognition that some students identify as religious; and that religious and non-religious perspectives are widely conceived of as binary, meaning either ‘secular’ or religious. We conclude that these findings demonstrate, at this institution, a struggle to think and act strategically and consistently on religion <b>and</b> <b>belief,</b> <b>and</b> suggest that, because of their influential educational positions, this reflects and reproduces muddled thinking and acting about religion <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> in wider society...|$|R

40|$|Introduction This article {{reports the}} {{findings}} from the interviews with the main United Kingdom faith <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> leaders which were commissioned by the Organ Donation Taskforce as part of its evidence gathering when exploring the potential impact of an opt-out system for organ donation. Methodology 17 interviews were arranged with the main faith <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> organisations within the United Kingdom. Interviews covered a range of issues related to organ donation and opt-in and opt-out. Results The majority of faith <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> leaders are supportive of the opt-in system, and favour retaining it over the introduction of an opt-out system. Whilst the shortcomings of the current system are recognised, the majority felt that there is scope to make improvements without changing legislation. Conclusion In order to achieve better engagement on organ donation with members of faith <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> groups in the future, it will be important to continue the dialogue that has begun with these interviews. It is important not only for the public {{to be aware of the}} position of faith <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> leaders, but also just as important for the medical profession and policy makers to recognise that all United Kingdom faith <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> leaders interviewed wish organ donation and transplantation to be a success.

We investigate such systems. In {{the first part of}} the paper knowledge <b>and</b> <b>belief,</b> without time, are considered. Common knowledge <b>and</b> common <b>belief</b> are defined <b>and</b> compared. A logical system and a family of models are proposed, a completeness result is proved and a decision procedure described. In the second part of the paper, time is considered. Different notions of beliefs are distinguished, obeying different properties of persistence. One interpretation of belief which obeys a very strong persistence axiom is put forward and used in the analysis of the “wise men” puzzle...|$|R
5|$|A {{recurring}} plot {{element is}} {{the depiction of}} Kyle as insecure about Jewish traditions <b>and</b> <b>beliefs.</b> Already regarding God as cruel for allowing him to suffer from a life-threatening hemorrhoid while Cartman enjoys a million-dollar inheritance, Kyle became further appalled after being read the story of Job. He also once feared damnation for not having grown up as a Catholic. During both instances, he renounced his affiliation with Judaism, only to have his faith restored by events occurring {{at the end of}} an episode. After watching The Passion of the Christ, a shameful Kyle suddenly felt that Cartman's anti-Semitism was justified, and suggested to angry members of his synagogue that the Jews apologize for the death of Jesus. Kyle's guilt is alleviated when he encounters Mel Gibson, the film's director, and perceives him to be a deranged masochist.|$|E
5|$|According {{to local}} legend Marko's mother was Evrosiya (Евросия), {{sister of the}} Bulgarian voivoda Momchil (who ruled {{territory}} in the Rhodope Mountains). At Marko's birth three narecnitsi (fairy sorceresses) appeared, predicting {{that he would be}} a hero and replace his father (King Vukašin). When the king heard this, he threw his son into the river in a basket to get rid of him. A samodiva named Vila found Marko and brought him up, becoming his foster mother. Because Marko drank the samodivas milk, he acquired supernatural powers and became a Bulgarian freedom fighter against the Turks. He has a winged horse named Sharkolia ("dappled") and a stepsister, the samodiva Gyura. Bulgarian legends incorporate fragments of pagan mythology <b>and</b> <b>beliefs,</b> although the Marko epic was created as late as the 14–18th centuries. Among Bulgarian epic songs, songs about Krali Marko are common and pivotal.|$|E

5|$|Brahmashiva, {{the court}} poet of King Vikramaditya VI, earned the title Kavichakravarti ("Emperor among poets") from his patron for his writing Samayaparikshe ("Analysis of the doctrine", c.1125). In this {{philosophical}} writing, containing touches of propagandist satire and humor, the author seeks {{to prove the}} virtues of Jainism superior to all other contemporary religions. Brahmashiva portrays contemporary life <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> {{of the people of}} the Kannada-speaking region. He criticises Hinduism and the conversion of a Jain temple originally dedicated to the Tirthankar Chandrapraba in Kholapur into a Hindu temple deifying the goddess Mahalakshmi. He expresses reservation regarding the existence of religious cosmopolitanism within a household where family members followed multiple faiths. The author is concerned about the eroding popularity of Jainism in southern India due to the rising popularity of the Veerashaiva movement. Prince Kirtivarma, a younger brother of King Vikramaditya VI, wrote Govaidya ("Cattle Medicine"), the earliest available writing in Kannada on veterinary science, which mixes medicine and magic.|$|E

These documents outline the key beliefs held by Christians about Jesus, including his divinity, humanity, and earthly life, and that he is the Christ and the Son of God. Despite their many shared beliefs, not all Christian denominations agree on all doctrines, and both major and minor differences on teachings <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> have persisted throughout Christianity for centuries.|$|E
