40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} factor subsidies on capital formation and employment in an OLG small open economy model of wealth accumulation. Two cases are explored, one with neoclassical wages and one with incentive-wages. We show that in the neoclassical model <b>a</b> capital <b>subsidy</b> spurs capital and causes a temporary increase in manhours which vanishes in the long-run, while <b>a</b> labor <b>subsidy</b> may temporarily increase inputs, but is neutral for steady state capital and labor. In the incentive-wage economy, <b>a</b> capital <b>subsidy</b> boosts investment and aggravates unemployment, while <b>a</b> labor <b>subsidy</b> stimulates employment and will in some conditions depress capital formation...|$|R
40|$|An {{individual}} {{should be}} indifferent between <b>a</b> rebate <b>subsidy</b> of rate sr and <b>a</b> matching <b>subsidy</b> of rate sm = sr/(1 - sr), {{and the total}} amount received by the charity {{should be the same}} regardless of subsidy type. Recent laboratory and field experiments contradict these straightforward predictions of standard economic theory: subjects consistently make decisions that result in larger amounts going to the charity under <b>a</b> matching <b>subsidy</b> than under <b>an</b> equivalent rebate <b>subsidy.</b> This paper tests whether this result is due to rebate-aversion – a preference by donors for a match over <b>a</b> rebate <b>subsidy.</b> Consistent with theory we find no significant preference for one or the other subsidy scheme. We do however find that, as in previous studies, participants selecting the matching subsidy made decisions that resulted in approximately twice the donations of participants selecting the rebate subsidy donated.

50|$|The strongest {{opposition}} to the proposal by Northwestel came from Telus.

50|$|The idea of wage {{insurance}} {{has been}} tested as early as 1995 in Canada's Earnings Supplement Project. Robert Litan and Lori Kletzer proposed the idea for wage insurance in United States in a 2001 paper. The basic concept became the United States Department of Labor's Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance for Older Workers (ATAA). The ATAA compliments the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which does not offer <b>a</b> wage <b>subsidy</b> or wage insurance. The TAA focuses on retraining workers while the ATAA includes <b>a</b> wage <b>subsidy</b> for workers who are considered too old to undergo retraining. The ATAA program includes <b>a</b> wage <b>subsidy</b> for laid off workers {{over the age of}} 50 who held a job with wages less than $50,000 a year, and who start a new job within 26 weeks of being laid off. The program gives <b>a</b> wage <b>subsidy</b> of half the difference between the worker's old and new wages with <b>a</b> maximum <b>subsidy</b> of $10,000. The subsidy can last for up to two years.|$|R

We use experimental economic methods to testbed <b>a</b> smart <b>subsidy</b> proposal relative to two standard policy options, compulsion and <b>a</b> standard fixed-fee <b>subsidy.</b> <b>A</b> smart <b>subsidy</b> creates <b>an</b> explicit network externality between neighboring landowners by paying an additional agglomeration bonus when they retire land adjacent to other conserved parcels, both their own and their neighbors.

40|$|This paper {{integrates}} {{the search}} model of unemployment into an intertemporal framework and examines the dynamic e⁄ects of a labor income tax, a capital income tax, <b>an</b> unemployment <b>subsidy,</b> <b>a</b> vacancy <b>subsidy,</b> and <b>an</b> investment tax credit.

40|$|We utilize a two-good, two-period intertemporal {{framework}} {{to examine the}} effects of terms of trade improvement on a small economy. A temporary terms of trade improvement in the current period increases the real GDP in the current period—total welfare and welfare within each period rise by the net wealth effect and the net intertemporal effect. The rise in GDP is more than consumption in the current period, leading to a balance of trade improvement in the current period. ^ We modify this two-period {{framework to}} analyze the effects of export and production <b>subsidies</b> on <b>a</b> small open economy. In the absence of investment, <b>a</b> temporary <b>subsidy</b> in the current period leads to a welfare loss as well as a balance of trade deterioration in the current period. <b>A</b> temporary <b>subsidy</b> in the current period, by bringing in production distortions, reduces GDP in the current period. The resulting welfare loss is distributed between two periods. Since GDP falls more than consumption, the balance of trade deteriorates in the current period. <b>A</b> temporary export <b>subsidy,</b> compared to <b>a</b> production <b>subsidy,</b> in the current period leads to a lower welfare level, higher exports, and a smaller balance of trade deterioration in the current period. ^ We utilize a two-good infinite horizon model to compare the effects of export and production <b>subsidies</b> on <b>a</b> small open economy, in presence of investment. <b>A</b> permanent <b>subsidy</b> permanently raises capital stock—the net foreign assets fall in order to finance investment. <b>A</b> permanent <b>subsidy</b> raises net output and welfare through capital formation and the lowering of installation costs of investment, but lowers welfare by creating distortions—the net effect on welfare is ambiguous. <b>A</b> permanent export <b>subsidy,</b> compared to <b>a</b> permanent production <b>subsidy,</b> introduces <b>an</b> additional distortion by raising the domestic installation costs of investment—consequently, the rise in the capital stock and level of the net foreign assets, are lower in case of <b>a</b> permanent export <b>subsidy.</b> <b>A</b> temporary production <b>subsidy</b> always induces initial investment—however, a minimum level or duration of export subsidy is necessary to spur initial investment.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the effect}} of retaliation with countervailing tariffs and/or production subsidies on the strategic argument for export subsidies, and also proves the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium in the standard model of international trade under oligopoly. Retaliation will be modelled as a multistage game. At the first stage, the foreign country sets its export subsidy to maximise national welfare. Then, at the second stage, the domestic country sets its trade policy, import tariff and/or production subsidy, to maximise national welfare {{in response to the}} foreign export subsidy. The solution concept employed is the subgame perfect equilibrium. When the domestic country uses a tariff in response to <b>a</b> foreign export <b>subsidy,</b> then the optimal domestic response is a partially countervailing tariff, and the foreign country does not usually gain from <b>an</b> export <b>subsidy.</b> There is usually no profit shifting argument for <b>an</b> export <b>subsidy</b> when the foreign country faces retaliation with countervailing tariffs. When the domestic country uses a tariff and <b>a</b> production <b>subsidy</b> in response to <b>a</b> foreign export <b>subsidy,</b> then the surprising result is that <b>an</b> export <b>subsidy</b> may increase foreign welfare.
