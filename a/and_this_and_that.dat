But then came the season, Lady Clara Pulleyn's first season in London, and Jack was more alive than ever. There was no ball {{he did not go}} to; no opera (that is to say, no opera of certain operas) which he did not frequent. It was easy to see by his face, two minutes after entering a room, whether the person he sought was there or absent; not difficult for those who were in the secret to watch in another pair of eyes the bright kindling signals which answered Jack's fiery glances. Ah! how beautiful he looked on his charger on the birthday, all in a blaze of scarlet, and bullion, and steel. O Jack! tear her out of yon carriage, from the side of yonder livid, feathered, painted, bony dowager! place her behind you on the black charger; cut down the policeman, and away with you! The carriage rolls in through St. James's Park; Jack sits alone with his sword dropped to the ground, or only atra cura on the crupper behind him; and Snip, the tailor, in the crowd, thinks it is for fear of him Jack's head droops. Lady Clara Pulleyn is presented by her mother, the Countess of Dorking; and Jack is arrested that night as he is going out of White's to meet her at the Opera.|$|E
60|$|My dearest Mrs. Martin,--Having nine lives, as I say, I am alive again, and prosperous--thanking you for {{wishing to}} know. People {{look at me}} and laugh, because it's a clear case of bulbous root with me--let me pass (being humble) for the onion. I was looking miserable in February, and really could {{scarcely}} tumble across the room, and now I am up on my perch again--nay, even out of my cage door. The weather is divine. One feels in one's self why the trees are green. I go out, walk out, have recovered flesh and fire--my very hair curls differently. 'Is I, I?' I say with the metaphysicians. There's something vital about this Florence air, for, though much given to resurrection, I never made such a leap in my life before after illness. Robert and I need to run as well as leap. We have quantities of work to do, and small time to do it in. He is four hours a day engaged in dictating to a friend of ours who transcribes for him, and I am not even ready for transcription--have not transcribed a line of my six or seven thousand. We go to England, or at least to Paris, next month, but it can't be early. Oh, may we meet you! Our little Penini is radiant, and altogether we are all in good spirits. Which is a shame, you will say, considering the state of affairs at Sebastopol. Forgive me. I never, at worst, thought that the great tragedy of the world was going on there. It was tragic, but there are more chronic cruelties and deeper despairs--ay, and more exasperating wrongs. For the rest, we have the most atrocious system in Europe, and we mean to work it out. Oh, you will see. Your committees nibble on, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> poisonous berry is pulled off leisurely, while the bush to the root of it remains, and the children eat on unhindered on the other side. I had hoped that there was real feeling among politicians. But no; we are put off with a fast day. There, an end! I begin to think that nothing will do for England but a good revolution, and a 'besom of destruction' used dauntlessly. We are getting up our vainglories again, smoothing our peacock's plumes. We shall be as exemplary as ever by next winter, you will see.|$|E

2500|$|His {{influential}} Two Treatises (1690), {{the foundational}} text of liberal ideology, outlined his major ideas.

A qualitative analysis of the data revealed that the language impaired subjects appeared to follow the same developmental sequence as normal children in their acquisition of these terms and responded by using the same strategies that younger non-language impaired children use at equivalent stages of development. Furthermore, the language impaired subjects appeared to comprehend the deictic terms in a predictable order based on their relative semantic complexity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Microsporidia {{are well}} known models of extreme nuclear genome {{reduction}} and compaction. The smallest microsporidian genomes have received the most attention, but genomes of different species {{range in size from}} 2. 3 Mb to 19. 5 Mb {{and the nature of the}} larger genomes remains unknown. Results Here we have undertaken genome sequence surveys of two diverse microsporidia, Brachiola algerae and Edhazardia aedis. In both species we find very large intergenic regions, many transposable elements, and a low gene-density, all in contrast to the small, model microsporidian genomes. We also find no recognizable genes that are not also found in other surveyed or sequenced microsporidian genomes. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that microsporidian genome architecture varies greatly between microsporidia. Much of the genome size difference could be accounted for by non-coding material, such as intergenic spaces <b>and</b> retrotransposons, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> suggests <b>that</b> the forces dictating genome size may vary across the phylum. </p...|$|R
40|$|We present multiwavelength {{observations}} of the newly discovered X-ray transient XTE J 1118 + 480 obtained in the rising phase of the 2000 April outburst. This source is located at unusually high Galactic latitude and in a very low absorption line of sight. This made the first EUVE spectroscopy of an X-ray transient outburst possible. Together with our HST, RXTE, <b>and</b> UKIRT data <b>this</b> gives unprecedented spectral coverage. We find the source in the low hard state. The flat IR-UV spectrum {{appears to be a}} combination of optically thick disk emission and flat spectrum emission, possibly synchrotron, while at higher energies, including EUV, a typical low hard state power-law is seen. EUVE observations reveal no periodic modulation, suggesting an inclination low enough that no obscuration by the disk rim occurs.

40|$|Abstract. A Banach space X {{is said to}} be B-convex if it is B_n-convex {{for some}} n≥ 2. As is well-known, B-convexity is an {{isomorphic}} invariant, but B_n-convexity is not so. In this short note, we are concerned with the stability of B_n-convexity under norm perturvations. It is known (cf. [7]) that X is B_n-convex (n≥ 2) if and only if the n-th von Neumann-Jordan constant C_NJ^(n) (X) is less than n. We show that for isomorphic Banach spaces X and Y it holds C_NJ^(n) (Y) ≤ C_NJ^(n) (X) d(X, Y) ^ 2, where d(X, Y) denotes the Banach-Mazur distance between X <b>and</b> Y; <b>and</b> <b>this</b> implies <b>that</b> if X is B_n^- convex, then there exists A_n> 1 such that all Banach spaces Y satisfying d(X, Y) <λ_n are B_n-convex. In the case X=l_p or L_p[0, 1], 1 <p<∞, it is also shown that all Banach spaces Y satisfying d(X, Y) <n^ 1 /f are B_n^- convex, where r = {p,p^j} and 1 /p+ 1 /p’= 1. Moreover, if X=l_p^n or L_p[0, 1], 1 <p≤ 2, then there exists a Banach space Y with d(X, Y) =n^ 1 /p’ such that Y is not B_n-convex...|$|R
