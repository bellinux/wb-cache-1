40|$|In this thesis, the {{utilization}} of alternative fuels for NO x reduction by means of reburning and advanced reburning is sonsidered. Laboratory experiments, full-scale experiments and computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations are {{the basis of the}} thesis. The goal of the work was to characterize alternative fuels used in cement kilns, with focus on the processes taking place in the precalciner of the cement kiln. To facilitate testing under controlled process conditons, a lab-scale circulating fluidized bed combustion (CFBC) reactor was designed and constructed. A comprehensive study on the fluidization regime in CFBC reactors and precalciners was required to ensure and verify that the operational regime in the CFBC reactor was simular to the regime in a precalciner. Different alternative fuels, such as refuse derived fuel, <b>animal</b> <b>meal</b> and solid hazardous waste, were tested in the CFBC reactor, which proved well suited for characterization of alternative fuels and investigations of NO x reduction, even though the operation of a CFBC reactor is quite complex and gives a certain variation in stability. Experiments with and without circulating mass n the CFBC reactor demonstraded the importance of executing the laboratory combustion experiments in an environment similar to that in the full-scale process, i. e. in the precalciner. <b>Animal</b> <b>meal</b> is beleived to follow the reduction route of selective non-catalytic reduction or advanced reburning and to have a special capability of reducing NO x during increased NO x concentrations at the reactor inlet. The increased CO emissions during advanced reburning with <b>animal</b> <b>meal</b> {{are most likely to be}} due to the competition for the OH radical during oxidation of CO and of NH 3. Furthermore, it was shown, for all fuels, that an increased concentration of NO x at the reactor inlet increases the ratio of NO x at the exit and NO x supplied. Full-scale experiments were executed at Norcem's kiln 6 in Brevik, using solid hazardous waste in combination with urea pellets, as well as with <b>animal</b> <b>meal,</b> to obtain advanced reburning. The full-scale experiments showed that advanced reburning. The full-scale experiments showed that advanced reburning and reburning with <b>animal</b> <b>meal</b> are well suited for NO x reduction. NO x reductions of up to 73 and 63 % during advanced reburning and reburning (with <b>animal</b> <b>meal),</b> respectively, were obtained. For the CFD simulations a grid of 240, 000 cells was generated using GAMBIT. Euler-Euler granular multiphase simulations with FLUENT 4 were executed to verify the assumption of dilute flow and the importance of particle-particle collisons. Euler-Langrangian simulations were executed in FLUENT 6 to investigate the combusting particles, e. g. particles-trjectory, retension time and species concentrations. The CFD simulatons revealed important information about the flow regime e. g. low degree of mixing between the kiln side and tertiary side of the calciner, which is important as far as burnout is concerned. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
40|$|The {{microbiological}} {{quality of the}} ingredients used in feed production is extremely important for animal and public health because food can transmit pathogens. Chemical additives, such as Salmex (R), {{may be used to}} control these pathogens, since many sporulated microorganisms are resistant to conventional heat treatment. For these reasons, through the conventional bacteriological methods, this study evaluated the presence of pathogens in <b>animal</b> <b>meal</b> and tests the efficiency of additives to combat highly resistant microorganisms. Of the 180 samples of meal analyzed, 71 (39. 4 %) were positive for the presence of Clostridium perfringens, and 41 (22. 8 %) were positive for the presence of Salmonella spp. The additive tested, Salmex (R), was effective in eliminating C. perfringens, with significantly decreased bacterial counts 24 h after treatment and total absence of C. perfringens after five days of treatment in all the samples tested. The presence of the pathogens Salmonella spp. and C. perfringens in <b>animal</b> <b>meal</b> endanger both the public and animal health.

40|$|Today {{we see a}} {{substantial}} increase in the use of alternative fuels in the cement industry. The prospect of reduction in fuel costs and the environmental benefits of waste to energy conversion are the driving forces. For several years Norcem have steadily increased their use of alternative fuels such as refuse derived fuel (RDF), liquid hazardous waste (LHW), solid hazardous waste (SHW), <b>animal</b> <b>meal</b> (AM) and waste oil (WO). Alternative fuels behave differently compared to e. g. coal during combustion, which is a factor that may influence the clinker quality, kiln operation, energy consumption and emissions. Scancem International ANS and Telemark University College has therefore initiated a research program to provide a better basis for characterization and understanding of alternative fuels in cement kilns. The study focus on the effect of alternative fuel properties on NOx reduction by advanced reburning and reburning in conjunction with CO emission. A laboratory circulating fluidized bed combustor (CFBC) is applied, in addition to full scale experiments at kiln 6 Norcem Brevik. Furthermore, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations with the aid of Fluent Â® on the flow regime of the precalciner at kiln 6 Norcem Brevik is performed. This paper will summarize the findings including results from full-scale experiments with advanced reburning, <b>animal</b> <b>meal</b> and solid hazardous waste as a reburning fuel and with comparable tests in the CFBC reactor...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} {{characteristics of a}} near infrared microscopy (NIRM) method, when applied to the detection of animal products in feedingstuffs, were determined via a collaborative study. The method delivers qualitative results {{in terms of the}} presence or absence of animal particles in feed and differentiates animal from vegetable feed ingredients on the basis of the evaluation of near infrared spectra obtained from individual particles present in the sample. The specificity ranged from 86 % to 100 %. The limit of detection obtained on the analysis of the sediment fraction, prepared as for the European official method, was 0. 1 % processed animal proteins (PAPs) in feed, since all laboratories correctly identified the positive samples. This limit has to be increased up to 2 % for the analysis of samples which are not sedimented.

40|$|<b>Animal</b> <b>meal</b> {{obtained}} from animal offal offers a fairly complete source {{of most of}} the aminoacids required for a balanced animal diet. These products are used to correct nutritional deficiencies of other foodstuffs used in animal feed, such as vegetable feeds. However, <b>animal</b> <b>meal</b> is a good source for microorganism growth during processing or storage. A government regulation proposes that a stage of feed sterilization could be carried out before cooking the animal byproducts (offal, feathers, etc.) or even of the meal itself, considering that if direct saturated steam is used, the minimum temperature should be 133 Â°C, for a minimum of 20 minutes, or if dry heat is used the meal should be exposed to a dry heat of 140 Â°C for a minimum of 3 hours. In industry, a final product that meets both the sanitary standards and high protein content is required. In this context, this work aimed to study different strategies for processing meal prepared from byproducts of poultry slaughterhouses, searching for the most effective technique for sterilization: whether pre-digestion or sterilization of the meal itself. Industrial (3, 000 kg) and pilot (150 kg) plant tests were carried out. Sterilization on an industrial scale presented a better performance than the pilot plant tests. Protein content increased in all tests and the final digestibility of the meal was approximately 92 per cent, which increases its final market value.

The meat industry {{is among the most}} polluting industries because of the large amounts of organic waste produced during meat processing. The objective {{of this study was to}} combine the CP and FMEA tools and to apply them in a pig slaughterhouse in order to detect critical points along the production chain that have a major environmental impact and to establish corrective and preventive actions that could minimize these problems. The results showed that water is the most consumed resource by the industry and also the main producer of waste due to microbiological contamination with animal feces and blood and meat residues. All impacts were found to be real due to their daily occurrence in the industry. Their severity, occurrence, detection and coverage were classified as moderate and high, high, low and moderate, and moderate and high, respectively. The application of the CP and FMEA tools was efficient in identifying and evaluating the environmental impacts caused by the slaughter and processing of pork carcasses. Liquid slaughter effluents and solid wastes (blood and bones) are the factors that pose the greatest risks to the environment. The substitution of treatment plant chemicals with decomposing microorganisms, composting, and the production of <b>animal</b> <b>meal</b> and feed from solid waste are appropriate measures the industry could adopt to minimize the contamination of water resources and soil...|$|E
40|$|The {{carry-over}} {{of certain}} feed components into animal products {{can be of}} concern for human health. The safety assessment of chemical contaminants including natural toxins, agrochemicals, veterinary drugs, and environmental pollutants {{is a key element}} of the âfarm-to-forkâ (âOne Healthâ) approach. The transmissibility of proteinaceous feed constituents such as enzymes, proteins from genetically engineered crops, and infectious prions in <b>animal</b> <b>meal</b> has also become of interest; but the transfer of proteins with allergic potential is little studied. In the present study, an exploratory zebrafish feeding trial using feed containing 20 percent of processed larvae of the marine fish parasite Anisakis simplex was performed as a proof-of-principle experiment. After a 2 -week exposure period, anisakid peptides were detected in zebrafish tissue by high-resolution liquid-chromatography Orbitrap mass spectrometry and immunostaining using specific polyclonal antibodies or sera from patients with confirmed allergy to A. simplex. Since fishmeal produced from marine pelagic fish is an important feed component in the culture of Atlantic salmon and in the poultry industry, it should be considered as a source of potentially allergenic peptides in the final products. Furthermore, the substitution of fishmeal with plant proteins would not eliminate the potential health risk by allergen carry-over since crops of high nutritional value such as legumes also contain important food allergens. If our preliminary results from the present zebrafish feeding trial should be confirmed in necessary follow-up experiments, the question of labeling information on fish and animal food products raised on feed containing potentially allergenic ingredients could arise in order to minimize the exposure risk of allergic consumers...|$|E
40|$|The high burning temperature, {{the long}} {{retention}} time inside the kiln, the oxidizing atmosphere, the ash absorption in the clinker and the chemical conditions render the cement kilns ideal installations where wastes can be burned safely. Consequently, {{some of the}} wastes may be potential candidates {{to be used as}} alternative fuels in cement production that boasts a lot of environmental benefits. These wastes include a variety of materials like used tires, <b>animal</b> <b>meal,</b> refused derived fuels (RDF), solvents, used oils, biomass etc. During the clinker production process, the organic part of the wastes is totally destroyed whereas the inorganic compounds and heavy metals are incorporated in the interstitial phase or substitute calcium or silicon in the silicate phases of the clinker. However, due to their origin these wastes introduce into the cement making process several trace elements that may affect the process itself as well as the properties of clinker. This work investigates the effects of the use of biomass (cotton stalks) and RDF on the properties of Portland cement clinker. In this respect, ash of these two waste materials was introduced in the raw mix in diverse proportions. The clinkerization characteristics and the microstructure of the lab prepared raw mixes and of the reference mixture were investigated by Differential Thermal Analysis- Thermogravimetry (DTA/TG), Optical Microscopy (OM) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The derived results suggest that both waste materials, RDF and cotton stalks can be used as an alternative to replace fossil fuels, such as coal, for the production of Portland cement clinker...|$|E
40|$|Cotton (Gossypium spp.) is {{the most}} {{important}} fiber crop of world and provides fiber, oil, and <b>animals</b> <b>meals.</b> Weeds interfere with the growth activities of cotton plants and compete with it for resources. All kinds of weeds (grasses, sedges, and broadleaves) have been noted to infest cotton crop. Weeds can cause more than 30 % decrease in cotton productivity. Several methods are available for weed control in cotton. Cultural control carries significance for weed control up to a certain extent. However, mechanical control and chemical control are the backbone of weed management plans in cotton crop. Use of allelopathy has also been found effective for suppressing weeds in cotton. Allelopathy used in several forms (such as intercropping, mulches, and crop rotation) contributes to weed control in cotton crop. All of these weed management practices may be integrated to achieve economical and sustainable weed control in cotton with an ultimate result of improved weed control, productivity, quality of produce in cotton crop...|$|R
40|$|Restrictions {{in the use}} of {{meat and}} bone meal (MBM) as {{ruminant}} feedstuffs were introduced by the European Commission {{as a response to the}} BSE spreading. The present paper describes an innovative protocol based on molecular techniques for the detection of animal contaminants using the Real-time PCR approach in âone stepâ. Two sets of primers and probes were designed in a highly conserved region of vegetables and Vertebrate mitochondrial DNA and were used to amplify DNA extracted from laboratory made samples prepared mixing pure vegetal feedstuffs with different concentration of commercial <b>meals</b> of <b>animal</b> origin. This approach revealed to be effective for the detection of up to 0. 5 % of different <b>animal</b> <b>meals</b> (bovine, porcine, ovine, rabbit, chicken, turkey, fish) in a mixture with pure vegetal feedstuff. This method may represent a valid alternative to current diagnostic methods for monitoring the quality of animal feedstuffs. Keywords: feedstuff, meat and bone meal (MBM), Real-time PC...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} {{the quality of}} raw materials destined for animal feed production, as well as the quality of corn produced in different areas of the Minas Gerais State. The study was conducted in a feed mill for poultry, with production capacity of 1, 000 t d- 1. Samples of corn, soybean, flours, <b>animal</b> <b>meals,</b> and feed, during the year of 2008 were collected for analysis of moisture, acidity, peroxides, crude protein, ethereal extract, and physical classification of the corn for "type". The collection of samples, physical-chemical analysis and classification of corn according to "type" were performed at the Industrial Laboratory and at the Department of Agricultural Engineering of Federal University of ViÃ§osa. It was concluded that: raw materials meet the minimum demands of quality (with regards to physical-chemical and nutritional aspects); the corn grains and some by-products present high indexes of moisture and are subject to microbiological contamination during storage; the corn produced in the different areas of Minas Gerais State can be classified as "type 1 " for commercialization...|$|R
