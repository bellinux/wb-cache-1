I acquired practical experience in this field during a year of practice in the Organization for Aid to Refugees and during an internship of several months in the Prague branch of UNICEF. The goal I set for my dissertation is to map and summarize asylum policy in the European Union and in which manner the asylum policy of the EU has influenced the asylum policy of the Czech Republic {{and the extent of}} this influence. From its beginnings to today, the Czech Republic has gone a long way in the field of asylum. Today, asylum law in the Czech Republic is regulated in a rather complex manner; however, one might pose the question of how effectively this has been done, whether this law is examined {{from the point of view}} of state organs or from the point of view of the <b>applicants</b> <b>for</b> <b>asylum</b> themselves. Asylum law is a branch of law which evolves and changes very quickly and very often, as it must reflect changes in international imigration, and not only political imigration - an essential criterion <b>for</b> granting <b>asylum,</b> but also economic imigration. The latter is not a reason for granting asylum; [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|To {{emphasize}} the importance of a common humanitarian position on the outflow of Zimbabweans into the region the Regional Office for Southern Africa of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs coined the term [...] "migrants of humanitarian concern" [...] in 2008. Most of those crossing the border did not apply for refugee status, but they could also hardly be considered as [...] "voluntary" [...] economic migrants. Many of them were not legally protected, nor do they receive humanitarian support. In Botswana, Zambia and Malawi, asylum is available to Zimbabweans; in Mozambique, the few <b>applicants</b> <b>for</b> <b>asylum</b> had been rejected due to the state's decision to consider Zimbabweans as 'economic' and not as forced humanitarian migrants. Except for South Africa, protection and access to services in most countries in the region is contingent on receiving the refugee status, and require asylum seekers to stay in isolated camps, unable to work or travel, and thus send money to relatives that stayed behind in Zimbabwe. South Africa was considering the introduction of a special permit for Zimbabweans, but the policy was still under review.|$|R
5000|$|An {{applicant}} initially presents {{his claim}} to an asylum officer, who may either grant asylum or refer the application to an Immigration Judge. If the asylum officer refers the application and the applicant is not legally authorized {{to remain in the}} United States, the applicant is placed in removal proceedings. After a hearing, an immigration judge determines whether the <b>applicant</b> is eligible <b>for</b> <b>asylum.</b> The immigration judge's decision is subject to review on two, and possibly three, levels. First, the immigration judge's decision can be appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals. In 2002, in order to eliminate the backlog of appeals from immigration judges, the Attorney General streamlined review procedures at the Board of Immigration Appeals. One member of the Board can affirm a decision of an immigration judge without oral argument; traditional review by three-judge panels is restricted to limited categories for which [...] "searching appellate review" [...] is appropriate. If the BIA affirms the decision of the immigration court, then the next level of review is a petition for review in the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the immigration judge sits. The court of appeals reviews the case to determine if [...] "substantial evidence" [...] supports the immigration judge's (or the BIA's) decision. As the Supreme Court held in INS v. Ventura, , if the federal appeals court determines that substantial evidence does not support the immigration judge's decision, it must remand the case to the BIA for further proceedings instead of deciding the unresolved legal issue in the first instance. Finally, an applicant aggrieved by a decision of the federal appeals court can petition the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case by a discretionary writ of certiorari. But the Supreme Court has no duty to review an immigration case, and so many <b>applicants</b> <b>for</b> <b>asylum</b> forego this final step.|$|R

40|$|Article 6 of the Treaty of the European Union (TEU) {{as part of}} the 2009 Treaty of Lisbon {{states that}} the European Union recognizes the rights, freedoms and {{principles}} set out in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. It also states fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). So, the fundamental rights system of the European Union consists of the constitutional traditions of the Member States of the Union, the rights of the ECHR and the obligatory provisions of the EU Charter. The ECJ refers to these three sources of law, while the ECtHR refers to the ECHR. Both, the ECJ and the ECtHR give judgments in cases concerning asylum and violation of human rights based on the European Union Regulation (EC) no. 343 / 2003, the so-called Dublin II Regulation determining the Member State responsible <b>for</b> examining an <b>asylum</b> application, and reviewing compliance with the criteria for determining responsibility <b>for</b> examining the <b>asylum</b> application and the shortcomings of human rights protection. In the Abdullah case before the ECJ applicant was a Somali national who entered Greece irregularly by boat via Syria and Turkey and without having lodged an asylum application in Greece she travelled to Austria and applied <b>for</b> <b>asylum.</b> She did not apply <b>for</b> <b>asylum</b> in Greece due to deficiencies in the Greek asylum system. The ECJ held that once a Member State takes charge of an application {{on the basis of the}} Dublin II Regulation can only be overturned if there are systemic deficiencies in the asylum procedure. She was not able to call into question the conditions for the reception of <b>applicants</b> <b>for</b> <b>asylum</b> in Greece and lost the case.

40|$|The {{dominant}} discourses on {{the issue}} of asylum have placed it on a uniquely higher level of scrutiny as a politically very sensitive area for social research. Today, member states within the EU have implemented stricter policies to control new arrivals, whilst instituting statutory procedures to manage the existing asylum claims. In 2010, the number of <b>applicants</b> <b>for</b> <b>asylum</b> in Finland totalled 5988, out of which 1784 were given positive decisions. This thesis endeavour to highlight asylum seekers in the discourses about them by adding their voices to the discussions of them in contemporary Finland. Studies, which has concentrated on asylum seekers in Finland, uses the living conditions within asylum reception centres to assess the impacts of structural barriers on asylum seekers’ efforts to deal with the asylum process. By highlighting the impacts of the entire asylum process, which I believe starts from the country of origin; I focus on examining narratives of dealing with the experience of liminality whilst waiting <b>for</b> <b>asylum,</b> and then explore areas of possible participation within informal social networks <b>for</b> West African <b>asylum</b> seekers in Finland. The overall aim is to place the current research within the broader sociological discussion of ‘belonging’ <b>for</b> <b>asylum</b> seekers who are yet to be recognized as refugees, and who exist in a state of limbo. Methodologically, oral interviews, self-written autobiographical narratives, and ethnographic field work are qualitatively combined as data in this thesis for an empirical study of West African male asylum seekers in Finland. Narrative analysis is employed to analyze the data for this thesis. The ethnographic research data for the study began in May 2009 and ended in August of 2010. Altogether, ten interviews and four self-written narratives were collected as data. In total seven hours of audio recording were made, along eleven pages of hand-written autobiographical narratives. Field observation notes are employed in the study to provide contexts to the active interactional processes of interpretation throughout the analysis. Findings from the study suggest that within the experience of liminality, which surrounds the entire asylum process, participations within informal social networks are found to be important to the process of re-making place and the sense of belonging. My study shows that this is necessary to countering the experience of boredom, stress and social isolation, which permeate all aspects of life <b>for</b> West African <b>asylum</b> seekers, whilst they wait <b>for</b> <b>asylum</b> decisions in Finland...|$|R

5000|$|Recent Nigerian {{migration}} to Ireland began after Nigeria's {{independence from the}} United Kingdom in 1960; migration began to accelerate slightly during the late 1960s Nigerian Civil War, though it remained small. Early Nigerian {{migration to}} Ireland consisted primarily of businesspeople, especially in the fishing industry (Irish-exported mackerel is widely consumed in Nigeria). Other early migrants included medical students, who had intended to return to Nigeria after completing their courses, but ended up staying in Ireland. Migration began to become more noticeable after 1981. Medical students trained at the Royal College of Surgeons as well as Trinity College. The first significant mass-migration of Nigerians to Ireland comprised Nigerians from the United Kingdom. Most came only {{with the intention of}} extending their UK visas and then returning, but the ones who failed settled down in Ireland as illegal immigrants. After the landmark High Court case Fajujonu v. Minister for Justice, which prohibited deportation of parents of Irish-born children, more Nigerians began coming to Ireland. Then, from around 1996, during Ireland's [...] "Celtic Tiger" [...] period of rapid economic expansion and labour shortages, some Nigerian workers were recruited from overseas by Irish companies, while others came to the country, seeking either opportunities for jobs, or to set up niche businesses aimed at other African migrants providing goods and services which they expected would not otherwise be available in the Irish market. Between 2002 and 2006, the population of Nigerian citizens in Ireland grew by 81.7%, according to Irish census figures, making them the country's fourth-largest migrant group at the time. Many recent migrants are asylum-seekers. However, from 2002 to 2009 the number of Nigerian <b>applicants</b> <b>for</b> <b>asylum</b> fell sharply, dropping from a peak of 4,050 to just 569. The sharp drop in Nigerian asylum applicants was due to the obtaining residency via parentage of Irish Citizen Children or Marriage to Irish and EU Spouses and due to the high failure rates in the granting of asylum and the granting of leave to remain. Nigerians were also in the top 3 candidates for Deportation Orders.|$|R
2500|$|The {{applicant}} has {{the burden}} of proving that he (or she) is eligible <b>for</b> <b>asylum.</b> To satisfy this burden, an applicant must show {{that she has a}} well-founded fear of persecution in her home country on account of either race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. [...] The applicant can demonstrate her well-founded fear by demonstrating that she has a subjective fear (or apprehension) of future persecution in her home country that is objectively reasonable. [...] An <b>applicant's</b> claim <b>for</b> <b>asylum</b> is stronger where she can show past persecution, in which case she will receive a presumption that she has a well-founded fear of persecution in her home country. The government can rebut this presumption by demonstrating either that the applicant can relocate to another area within her home country in order to avoid persecution, or that conditions in the applicant's home country have changed such that the applicant's fear of persecution there is no longer objectively reasonable. Technically, an asylum applicant who has suffered past persecution meets the statutory criteria to receive a grant of asylum even if the applicant does not fear future persecution. In practice, adjudicators will typically deny asylum status in the exercise of discretion in such cases, except where the past persecution was so severe as to warrant a humanitarian grant of asylum, or where the applicant would face other serious harm if returned to his or her country of origin. In addition, applicants who, according to the US Government, participated in the persecution of others are not eligible <b>for</b> <b>asylum.</b>|$|R
40|$|Since 1980, the Refugee Act {{has offered}} asylum {{to people who}} flee to the United States to escape {{persecution}} in their homeland. In 1996, however, Congress amended the law to bar asylum – regardless of the merit of the underlying claim – <b>for</b> any <b>applicant</b> who fails to apply within one year of entering the United States, unless the <b>applicant</b> qualifies <b>for</b> one of two exceptions to the rule. In {{the years since the}} bar was established, anecdotal reports have suggested that genuine refugees, with strong merits claims to asylum, have been rejected solely because of the deadline. Many scholars and practitioners suspected that this procedural bar had a dramatic effect on the U. S. asylum system. Until now, however, there has been no systematic, empirical study {{of the effects of the}} deadline on asylum seekers and the asylum system. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which is the first level adjudicator of affirmative applications <b>for</b> <b>asylum,</b> supplied the authors exclusively with a database of asylum claims that has never before been analyzed. This database includes demographic and other characteristics of all principal <b>applicants</b> <b>for</b> <b>asylum</b> before DHS since September 1998 – more than 300, 000 cases – and the decision reached in each case. In this article, the authors report, for the very first time, what that database shows about DHS’s application of the one year deadline. They find, among other things, that: Over the entire time frame studied, DHS determined that nearly a third of all affirmative asylum applicants missed the filing deadline. In the years immediately after the deadline went into effect (FY 1998 -FY 2002), DHS found only 27 % of applicants to be late, but after that, DHS determined a significantly higher percentage to be late (35 % from FY 2003 through June 8, 2009). DHS has rejected the applications (finding no applicable exception) in the cases of 59 % of those who were determined to have filed late (18 % of all affirmative asylum applicants). Applicants from certain countries such as the Gambia and Sierra Leone are much more disadvantaged by the deadline than applicants from certain other countries, such as Haiti and India. The deadline may particularly impact refugees who, upon arrival, are unable to find a community of emigrants from their home countries who could warn them about its existence. It is likely that as a result of the deadline, since April 1998 DHS has rejected more than 15, 000 asylum applications (involving more than 21, 000 refugees) that would otherwise have been granted. The authors conclude that because the costs of the one-year deadline exceed its benefits, it should be repealed, as proposed by several bills that have been introduced in Congress...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{migration}} {{in the context}} of European integration which implies, on the one hand, internal integration, integration within the EU and, on the other hand, the enlargement process related to the countries that have applied to join the EU. The aim is to determine in which way the migration, especially refugee crisis in 2015, had influence on the EU, as a supranational political community, and what was the impact on Serbia which {{is in the process of}} integration into the European Union. Migrant crisis has shown that the EU has to confront many different issues including several issues of great importance for its survival and strengthening: how to influence on global processes to a greater extent instead of dealing with the consequences of the global politics of others; how to preserve and keep the values that the EU itself is founded and the values on which should be built upon further construction of the political community and, finally, weather the EU can be transformed in the direction of the United European States, in both the functional and in terms of values, or the EU will move towards deepening of Europe of concentric circles. Faced with extremely complex migration situation, Serbia does not have the appropriate institutional and regulatory framework, nor a political response to a series of complex issues in the area of migration and migration-related issues, such as asylum system, irregular migration, sustainable return of our citizens asylum seekers in EU member states, implementation of the agreement on readmission, the departure of highly educated - brain drain, migration and development, the fight against human trafficking (protection of victims, prevention, criminal prosecution of traffickers), and smuggling of migrants, issues of border management, demarcation and boundary determination (as well as the agreement that should be concluded). Some of these problems migrant crisis has made visible by encouraging coping with the need of systemic response to the flaws in the regulatory framework, in the policy concerning asylum seekers, irregular migration through the territory of Serbia, as well as in the sustainable return of our citizens, <b>applicants</b> <b>for</b> <b>asylum</b> in member states. If we put all this {{in the context of}} untimely planning, ineffective management of economic trends, the lack of financial support from Brussels to deal with the refugee crisis, but also in the context of the fact that the enlargement policy is aimed at meeting the Copenhagen criteria, but not on economic growth - then the fears of uncontrolled influx of migrants pose potential capital of radical and populist political options. In the relationship with Brussels, Serbia would have to fight for more under-standing regarding the state of the economy and, in general, regarding help with the costs of joining the EU, especially in case of further escalation of the migrant crisis. Serbia's image in the international arena has been changing for better because of the human attitude towards refugees and migrants who were in transit, but for the citizens of Serbia is much more important that the attitude towards them is a part of the essential changes in the society, and not juste an agile response to the crisis - i. e. what metters most is to make appropriate administrative and legal measures, to effectively manage the problems that migrant crisis put in the foreground, but primarily to change the essence of political community and to have this change of image as a result of state and society transformation towards strengthening democratic institutions, the rule of law, media freedom and developed human rights and freedoms.
