He later discovered that someone had set up a monthly direct debit for £500 to Diabetes UK.|$|E
25|$|Designed in High Renaissance style, the {{building}} {{is not merely a}} replica of the United States Capitol. Local newspapers made <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> when Gilbert sent to Georgia for marble, but the result, in which a hemispherical dome caps a high drum not unlike that of St. Peter's Basilica, crowning a building housing the bicameral legislature and the state supreme court, was so nobly handsome that West Virginia and Arkansas contracted for Gilbert capitols as well. Its brick dome is held in hoops of steel.|$|E

500|$|Commentators {{viewed the}} success of Rome as crucial for the network, {{especially}} after the past mixed reception of Carnivàle and K-Street. In July 2005, James Hibberd of Television Week wrote that Rome was viewed [...] "as the network's best shot for adding another literate, must-see drama to its schedule". Writing for the same publication, Tom Shales said that HBO [...] "has made such <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> over Rome, and the network itself has put such painful pressure on the show (and its producers) to make a hefty impact, that it'll be scorned like a leper if it fails to make a truly gigantic splash." ...|$|E
500|$|Through Caldwell more {{officers}} {{joined the}} protest, including two other celebrated aces, Wing Commander Bobby Gibbes and Squadron Leader John Waddy, {{as well as}} Squadron Leader Bert Grace, Squadron Leader Douglas Vanderfield, and later, Squadron Leader Stuart Harpham. During {{a series of meetings}} early in April 1945, Caldwell proposed that the eight resign en masse, and the others agreed. Arthur later stated that, [...] "I meant to make as big <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> as I possibly could with the object of getting the position corrected... All the same, we realised that, to lay ourselves open to any charge of mutiny, we might lessen the force of what we were doing, which was the reason we put the things in as resignations and not as any attempt to unseat people higher up." ...|$|E
500|$|During the Iraq War Jackson {{admitted}} {{that the war was}} putting the service under strain, but called the claim that the Army was [...] "at breaking point", [...] "nonsense". Jackson was dismissive of claims that the Army was under-equipped, recalling his conversation with a soldier: [...] "There's a bit of <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> going on about boots and bog rolls and whatnot. Are you all right for boots?" [...] He later conceded that this could be seen as [...] "cavalier", and that he [...] "had no intention of belittling the gravity of the situation", but that he [...] "didn't want {{to send a message to}} the enemy that we were in any way not ready". Known for speaking his mind, Jackson attracted media attention towards the end of his tenure as CGS in 2006, when he criticised Norman Kember for Kember's apparent lack of gratitude to the soldiers who freed him from Iraqi kidnappers.|$|E

500|$|In April 1945, having {{recently}} assumed {{command of}} No.1 TAF's No.78 Wing, Arthur helped trigger {{an incident that}} {{became known as the}} [...] "Morotai Mutiny" [...] (a phrase originating in one of his aide memoires at the time). He was one of eight senior pilots, including Australia's top-scoring ace, Group Captain Clive Caldwell, and fellow veterans from the North African campaign, Bobby Gibbes and John Waddy, who attempted to resign their commissions in protest at the relegation of RAAF fighter squadrons to apparently worthless ground attack missions. Frustrated at the lack of attention paid by Headquarters No.1 TAF to a [...] "balance sheet" [...] he produced showing that operational losses outweighed results, Arthur later said that his object for the [...] "mutiny" [...] was to [...] "make as big <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> as I possibly could with the object of getting the position corrected." [...] A government inquiry into the incident exonerated the pilots, finding their motives in tendering their resignations to be sincere. Arthur remained in charge of No.78 Wing for the Battle of Tarakan, which commenced on 1May. He handed over command of the wing on 24May, but remained on Tarakan {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
500|$|The Daily Telegraphs Gerard O'Donovan {{agreed that}} [...] "June Brown, as Dot, was mesmerising", but was {{similarly}} {{critical of the}} episode as a whole, concluding: [...] "Overall [...] the feeling couldn’t be avoided that in the greater scheme of things this was <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> over nothing. Had it been a swan song, {{it would have been}} a worthy one. But doubtless Dot will be out and about again tonight, fag in hand, quoting from the Good Book. Enjoyable as this Albert Square indulgence was, I suspect that most fans will be hoping this one-hander remains a one-off." [...] Leigh Holmwood for The Guardian suggested that viewers may have agreed with O'Donovan's assessment, highlighting the fact that the episode received only 8.7million viewers, compared to 9.4million watching EastEnders the previous week. A 2003 episode centred around Dot also resulted in a notable ratings slump. The New Year episode, which detailed her childhood evacuation to the countryside, received just 8.1million viewers, compared with 12.2m the previous evening and 16m on Christmas Day. Prior to this, however, a 2002 two-hander episode featuring just Dot and Sonia Jackson (Natalie Cassidy) was watched by 11.5million viewers, with an almost 60% share of viewers in the timeslot.|$|E
500|$|South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut is {{a cautionary}} tale {{on the dangers of}} censorship. It uses the {{execution}} of Terrance and Phillip as the Seventh Sign in a parody of the Apocalypse. Cartman's use of foul language helps to avert the disaster. Parents and [...] "lazy child rearing" [...] come in for particularly sharp criticism. On their way to see Terrance and Phillip, the boys sing that [...] "movies teach us what our parents don't have time to say!" [...] During [...] "Blame Canada" [...] a couple are seen abandoning their baby in their enthusiasm to join Mothers Against Canada. The song ends with: [...] "We must blame them and cause <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> / Before somebody thinks of blaming us!" [...] Much of the film's satire and many of the songs are concerned with the refusal of people to accept responsibility for failure and their tendency to look for scapegoats (some of the songs are also parodies of musical theatre, but this is usually secondary to furthering the satire). Movies, government, society, foreigners and Satan are all blamed, leading Kyle to remark: [...] "whenever I get in trouble, you go off and blame everybody else. But I'm the one to blame. Deal with me." [...] The movie is also self-reflective in nature. The enthusiasm the kids display for seeing the Terrance and Phillip movie reflects the creators' anticipation of the real world enthusiasm many people, including those under age, would experience to see the movie.|$|E

500|$|The Guardian Gareth McLean {{described}} the episode as a [...] "bold move" [...] {{on the part}} of the EastEnders producers in deviating from the serial's usual format, and found it to be [...] "compelling and brave", but [...] "not as convincing as it should be". The Daily Telegraph Gerard O'Donovan felt that Brown gave a [...] "mesmerising" [...] performance, but was critical of the episode as a whole, concluding: [...] "Overall [...] the feeling couldn't be avoided that in the greater scheme of things this was <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> over nothing.

[...] Leigh Holmwood for The Guardian suggested that viewers may have agreed with O'Donovan's assessment, highlighting the fact that the episode received only 8.7million viewers, compared to 9.4million watching EastEnders the previous week. O'Donovan compared the episode to Krapp's Last Tape, saying [...] "it must be said there were quite a few moments of positively (or perhaps that should be negatively) Beckettian bleakness here as Dot recalled, in painfully vivid detail, how time and time again 'life took away everything I ever cared about' and 'all that I ever 'ad, I lorst'." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{arriving}} at Suez, {{the water that}} the Battalion had been promised {{was nowhere to be}} found. They were assured that the water was coming, but hours later it still had not appeared. Elliott then made one of the [...] "vigorous protests" [...] that he was becoming famous for. He even threatened to march them back across the Suez Canal to get them a drink. [...] "It was outrageous to deprive men of water in the desert" [...] Elliott thundered. He was assured that the water would be available at 05:30 the next morning. Elliott was up at 05:00, and found many of his men had been unable to sleep due to their thirst, and were licking at the taps around camp. He found the camp's Chief Engineer who informed him that the Egyptian civil authorities had not provided enough water for the troops in camp, and that he had strict orders not to start the pumps before 08:00, as it would wake the II Anzac Corps Commander, Lieutenant General Sir Alexander Godley. Elliott remounted his horse and went to II Anzac Corps Headquarters, where he informed a yawning staff officer in silk pyjamas that unless the water was turned on in the next five minutes, the brigade would be assembling and telling the Corps Commander exactly what they thought of him. The staff officer made a phone call, and Elliott was warned that he shouldn't make such <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> again. He simply replied that he would do whatever was needed to help his men whenever he had to.|$|E
500|$|Intense media {{interest}} in the opinions and private lives {{of the royal family}} during the 1980s led to a series of sensational stories in the press, not all of which were entirely true. As Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, told his staff: [...] "Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Don't worry if it's not true—so long as there's not too much of <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> about it afterwards." [...] Newspaper editor Donald Trelford wrote in The Observer of 21 September 1986: [...] "The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of... it is not just that some papers don't check their facts or accept denials: they don't care if the stories are true or not." [...] It was reported, most notably in The Sunday Times of 20 July 1986, that the Queen was worried that Margaret Thatcher's economic policies fostered social divisions and was alarmed by high unemployment, a series of riots, the violence of a miners' strike, and Thatcher's refusal to apply sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa. The sources of the rumours included royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal, but Shea claimed his remarks were taken out of context and embellished by speculation. Thatcher reputedly said the Queen would vote for the Social Democratic Party – Thatcher's political opponents. Thatcher's biographer John Campbell claimed [...] "the report was a piece of journalistic mischief-making". Belying reports of acrimony between them, Thatcher later conveyed her personal admiration for the Queen, and the Queen gave two honours in her personal gift – membership in the Order of Merit and the Order of the Garter – to Thatcher after her replacement as prime minister by John Major. Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said Elizabeth was a [...] "behind the scenes force" [...] in ending apartheid.|$|E

500|$|Laughton was {{so pleased}} with O'Hara's {{performance}} in Jamaica Inn {{that she was}} cast opposite him in The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939) for RKO in Hollywood. She boarded the RMS Queen Mary with him and her mother to New York, and then traveled by train to Hollywood. O'Hara's agent Lew Wasserman arranged for a pay increase from $80 a week to $700 a week. As {{the new face of}} RKO she garnered much attention from the Hollywood press and society before the film was even released, something which made her uncomfortable as she felt that she was being viewed as a [...] "novelty" [...] and [...] "people were making <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> over me because of something I hadn't yet done, something they just thought I might do". O'Hara portrayed Esmeralda, a gypsy dancer who is imprisoned and later sentenced to death by the Parisian authorities. Director William Dieterle initially showed concern that O'Hara was too tall and disliked her wavy hair, asking for her to step under a shower to straighten it out. Filming commenced in the San Fernando Valley, {{at a time when the}} city was experiencing its hottest summer in its history. O'Hara described it as a [...] "physically demanding shoot", due to the heavy makeup and costume requirements, and recalls that she gasped at Laughton in makeup as Quasimodo, remarking, [...] "Good God, Charles. Is that really you?". O'Hara insisted on doing her own stunts from the outset, and for the scene in which the hangman places a noose around her neck, no safety nets were used. The film was a commercial success, taking $3 million at the box office. O'Hara was generally praised for her performance though some critics thought that Laughton stole the show. One critic thought that was the strength of the film, writing: [...] "The contrast between Laughton as the pathetic hunchback and O'Hara as the fresh-faced, tenderly solicitous gypsy girl is Hollywood teaming at its most inspired".|$|E
2500|$|In addition, Khrushchev's {{impression}} of Kennedy's weaknesses {{was confirmed by}} the President's response during the Berlin Crisis of 1961, particularly to {{the building of the}} Berlin Wall. Speaking to Soviet officials {{in the aftermath of the}} crisis, Khrushchev asserted, [...] "I know for certain that Kennedy doesn't have a strong background, nor, generally speaking, does he have the courage to stand up to a serious challenge." [...] He also told his son Sergei that on Cuba, Kennedy [...] "would make <b>a</b> <b>fuss,</b> make more of <b>a</b> <b>fuss,</b> and then agree." ...|$|E

[...] An MTV spokesman said: [...] "Luckily Zane was OK and didn't make <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> about it." [...] This was proved to be an incorrect report as proved in the MTV footage.|$|E
2500|$|In 1973, Clark married {{law student}} Maureen McTeer. [...] They met when Clark hired {{her to work}} in his {{parliamentary}} office; McTeer had been a political organizer herself since her early teens. McTeer has developed her own career as a well-known author and lawyer, and caused something of <b>a</b> <b>fuss</b> by keeping her maiden name after marriage. That feminist practice was not common at the time, but was later taken up by other political wives, such as Hillary Clinton. Their daughter, Catherine has pursued a career in public relations and broadcasting.|$|E
