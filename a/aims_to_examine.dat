25|$|Measuring consumers' {{conscious}} and subconscious through studying their biological sensorimotor, {{cognitive and affective}} response to marketing stimuli, called neuromarketing, is of increasing interest to marketers {{in order to gain}} insight into how they consume. Dawkins (1989) explained that when we die we leave behind genes and memes; genes being the unit of genetic information, and memes the units of cultural information. Neuromarketing <b>aims</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> the memory of these memes in order to manipulate them.|$|E

500|$|For Simmel, culture {{referred}} to [...] "the cultivation of individuals through {{the agency of}} external forms which have been objectified in the course of history". While early theorists such as Durkheim and Mauss were influential in cultural anthropology, sociologists of culture are generally distinguished by their concern for modern (rather than primitive or ancient) society. Cultural sociology often involves the hermeneutic analysis of words, artefacts and symbols, or ethnographic interviews. However, some sociologists employ historical-comparative or quantitative techniques in the analysis of culture, Weber and Bourdieu for instance. The subfield is sometimes allied with critical theory in the vein of Theodor W. Adorno, Walter Benjamin, {{and other members of the}} Frankfurt School. Loosely distinct from the sociology of culture is the field of cultural studies. Birmingham School theorists such as Richard Hoggart and Stuart Hall questioned the division between [...] "producers" [...] and [...] "consumers" [...] evident in earlier theory, emphasizing the reciprocity in the production of texts. Cultural Studies <b>aims</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> its subject matter in terms of cultural practices and their relation to power. For example, a study of a subculture (such as white working class youth in London) would consider the social practices of the group as they relate to the dominant class. The [...] "cultural turn" [...] of the 1960s ultimately placed culture much higher on the sociological agenda.|$|E
