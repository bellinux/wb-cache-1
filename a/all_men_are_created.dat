25|$|Tensions {{erupted into}} battle between Patriot militia and British regulars when the British {{attempted}} {{to capture and}} destroy Colonial military supplies at Lexington and Concord in April 1775. The conflict then developed into a global war, during which the Patriots (and later their French, Spanish, and Dutch allies) fought the British and Loyalists in {{what became known as}} the American Revolutionary War (1775–83). Each of the thirteen colonies formed a Provincial Congress that assumed power from the old colonial governments and suppressed Loyalism, and from there they built a Continental Army under the leadership of General George Washington. The Continental Congress determined King George's rule to be tyrannical and infringing the colonists' rights as Englishmen, and they declared the colonies free and independent states on July 2, 1776. The Patriot leadership professed the political philosophies of liberalism and republicanism to reject monarchy and aristocracy, and they proclaimed that <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> equal.|$|E

The government still thinks a woman has no rights over her own body, and between Uncle Clarence who sexually harassed Anita Hill, and a closeted Klan court, that is a throwback to the 19th century, handpicked by Daddy Bush, Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford, between Clarence and that stacked court, they are about to undo Roe vs. Wade, just like they are about to un-do affirmative action.

500|$|U.S. Senator George Frisbie Hoar once judged Morton as a {{man with}} [...] "little regard for Constitutional scruples." [...] Not that Morton would have willfully flouted his oath to uphold the U.S. Constitution, but Hoar added, [...] "he {{believed}} that the Constitution should be interpreted {{in the light of}} the Declaration of Independence, so as to be the law of life to a great, powerful, and free people. To this principle of interpretation, all strict or narrow criticism, founded on its literal meaning, must yield."

500|$|Like Daniel Webster, James Wilson, and Joseph Story before him, Lincoln {{argued that}} the Declaration of Independence was a {{founding}} document of the United States, and that this had important implications for interpreting the Constitution, which had been ratified {{more than a decade}} after the Declaration. The Constitution did not use the word [...] "equality", yet Lincoln believed that the concept that [...] "all men are created equal" [...] remained a part of the nation's founding principles. He famously expressed this belief in the opening sentence of his 1863 Gettysburg Address: [...] "Four score and seven years ago [...] our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> equal." ...|$|E

He defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all. The emancipation of slaves was {{now part of the}} national war effort. He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end {{as a result of the}} losses, and the future of democracy in the world would be assured, that [...] "government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth". Lincoln concluded that the Civil War had a profound objective: a new birth of freedom in the nation.|$|E

5000|$|The {{building}} {{now known}} as the Maine Maid Inn was built in 1789 as the home for the prominent Quaker and abolitionist Valentine Hicks, his wife Abigail, and their children. Hicks' father Elias Hicks [...] "had been the spark that helped convince Quakers and other like-minded people after the Revolutionary War that <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> <b>created</b> equal—including people of color who were enslaved". Valentine Hicks was also an Underground Railroad station master; in his home - a key way station - a removable panel behind an upstairs linen closet (that is still there today) concealed a staircase to the attic where Hicks hid runaways until the coast was clear. [...] The Town of Oyster Bay designated the site as a historic town landmark in 2012. In 2015 {{there was a lot of}} outrage over the preservation of this historic site. Partial demolition of the Maine Maid Inn took place without the approval of the Oyster Bay landmark commission, which outraged many preservationists.|$|R
500|$|The Senate {{campaign}} {{featured the}} seven Lincoln–Douglas debates of 1858, {{the most famous}} political debates in American history. The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. Lincoln warned that [...] "The Slave Power" [...] was threatening the values of republicanism, and accused Douglas of distorting {{the values of the}} Founding Fathers that <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> equal, while Douglas emphasized his Freeport Doctrine, that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not, and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists. The debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands. Lincoln stated Douglas' popular sovereignty theory was a threat to the nation's morality and that Douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states. Douglas said that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court and the Dred Scott decision.|$|E

5000|$|The poem {{consists}} of 4 parts: [...] "Spring Joys" [...] (Pavasario linksmybės), [...] "Summer Toils" [...] (Vasaros darbai), [...] "Autumn Boons" [...] (Rudenio gėrybės), and [...] "Winter Cares" [...] (Žiemos rūpesčiai). In these 4 idylls, totaling 2997 hexameters, are depicted the natural setting of Lithuania Minor, its people, their work, and their customs. The poem depicts a realistic portrayal of Lietuvininkai (Prussian Lithuanians) peasants' {{life in the}} middle 18th century, as it was affected by colonization of East Prussia. Germans and Austrians, Swiss and French, brought in and given special consideration by the government, became the upper class of landlords and officials, while the indigenous population became the lower class of serfs. In The Seasons the village life of the latter is depicted as patriarchal in structure. The natural virtues idealized by the Pietist movement, diligence, piety, honesty, and submission to authority, flourish. Social consciousness of the people is largely dormant. There appear only a few characters through whose lips the poet accuses the gentry {{and the government of}} exploiting the people. However, such characters are not portrayed sympathetically; they are considered degenerates by the villagers in the poem and by its author. The poet contents himself with telling his readers that <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> <b>created</b> equal in the beginning and that only later did some become lords and others serfs. Donelaitis calls the latter burai (boors), and shows deep sympathy for them. He reprimands their evil exploiters, but he does not raise any protest against the system of serfdom.|$|R

2500|$|The program became {{well-known}} and distinguished visitors began to visit {{from all over}} the country. The U.S. Commissioner of education came to see firsthand what Pratt was doing, and so did the president of Amherst College. Pratt's Fort Marion program convinced him that [...] "distant education" [...] {{was the only way to}} totally assimilate the Indian. He wrote, the Indian [...] "is born a blank, like all the rest of us. Transfer the savage born infant to the surroundings of a civilization and he will grow to possess a civilized language and habit." [...] Witmer writes,If <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> equal, then why were blacks segregated in separate regiments and Indians segregated on separate tribal reservations? Why weren't all men given equal opportunities and allowed to assume their rightful place in society? Race became a meaningless abstraction in his mind.|$|E
2500|$|Inspired {{by these}} words, Bett sought the counsel of Theodore Sedgwick, a young abolition-minded lawyer, {{to help her}} sue for freedom in court. [...] According to Catherine Sedgwick's account, she told him, [...] "I heard that paper read yesterday, that says, <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> equal, and that every man {{has a right to}} freedom. I'm not a dumb critter; won't the law give me my freedom?" [...] After much {{deliberation}} Sedgwick accepted her case, {{as well as that of}} Brom, another of Ashley's slaves. [...] He enlisted the aid of Tapping Reeve, the founder of Litchfield Law School, one of America's earliest law schools, located in Litchfield, Connecticut. They were two of the top lawyers in Massachusetts, and Sedgwick later served as US Senator. Arthur Zilversmit suggests the attorneys may have selected these plaintiffs to test the status of slavery under the new state constitution.|$|E

This is underscored by the rift between the Sleepers and the Sleepless; the Sleepless are superior in mind and body, and easily capable of outperforming their normal cousins. <b>All</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> not <b>created</b> equal. Where, then, is the line between equality and excellence? How far should any superior minority hold themselves back for fear of engendering feelings of inadequacy in their inferiors? - especially if this minority is not hated and feared, but rather the elite? This question is explored, but not elaborated on by the novel.|$|R
5000|$|The {{style and}} {{format of the}} Declaration of Sentiments {{was that of the}} Declaration of Independence.

[...] The Declaration further stated, [...] "The history of mankind is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations on the part of man towards woman." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{contradiction between}} {{the claim that}} [...] "all <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> equal" [...] and the {{existence}} of American slavery attracted comment when the Declaration of Independence was first published. Before final approval, Congress, having made a few alterations to some of the wording, also deleted nearly a fourth of the draft, including a passage critical of the slave trade. At that time many members of Congress, including Jefferson, owned slaves, which clearly factored into their decision to delete the controversial [...] "anti-slavery" [...] passage. In 1776, abolitionist Thomas Day responding to the hypocrisy in the Declaration wrote, though the first draft stated [...] " [...] <b>All</b> free <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> equal": If there be an object truly ridiculous in nature, it is an American patriot, signing resolutions of independency with the one hand, and with the other brandishing a whip over his affrighted slaves.|$|R

2500|$|While Locke {{spoke in}} the {{language}} of natural law, the content of this law was by and large protective of natural rights, and it was this language that later liberal thinkers preferred. Political philosopher Jeremy Waldron has pointed out that Locke's political thought was based on [...] "a particular set of Protestant Christian assumptions." [...] To Locke, the content of natural law was identical with biblical ethics as laid down especially in the Decalogue, Christ's teaching and exemplary life, and St. Paul's admonitions. Locke derived the concept of basic human equality, including the equality of the sexes ("Adam and Eve"), from , the starting-point of the theological doctrine of Imago Dei. One of the consequences is that as all humans are created equally free, governments need the consent of the governed. Thomas Jefferson, arguably echoing Locke, appealed to unalienable rights in the Declaration of Independence, [...] "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."
