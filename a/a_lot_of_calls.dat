2500|$|John Bittrolff, a Suffolk county {{resident}} {{who was convicted}} of the murders of two prostitutes in 1993 and 1994, and is a suspect in the murder of a third woman from that time period, was named as a suspect in {{at least one of the}} LISK murders on September 12, 2017. Suffolk County District Attorney's office prosecutor Robert Biancavilla released a statement noting that Bittrolf was likely responsible for the deaths of other women, and that [...] "There are remains of the victims at Gilgo that may be attributed to the handiwork of Mr. Bittrolff, and that investigation is continuing". He also noted that there were some similarities between the murders that Bittrolff was convicted of, and some of the crime scenes at Gilgo Beach. Bittrolff was a carpenter who lived in Manorville, where the torsos of official LISK victims Jessica Taylor and [...] "Jane Doe No. 6" [...] were recovered. The remains were discovered roughly three miles away from Bittrolff's home. He was also a hunter who seemed to enjoy killing and mutilating animals, and reportedly once [...] "cut out the heart of a deer he had just shot and ate it raw in the woods". Neighbors also recalled him killing small animals when he was younger. Another link between Bittrolff and the Long Island Serial Killer case became apparent when it was revealed that the grown daughter of Rita Tangredi, one of the women that Bittrolff was convicted of killing, was reportedly [...] "best friends" [...] with Melissa Barthelemy, who was one of the first LISK victims discovered strangled and wrapped in burlap at Gilgo Beach. Barthelemy's mother also reported that Melissa [...] "had <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> to Manorville from her phone" [...] at the time.|$|E

50|$|After {{everyone}} has arrived, they all {{sit down for}} Christmas dinner. Everyone is digging into an abundant pile of food, chatting away, while Sarah sits there {{with a look of}} awe on her face as she has never experienced the holidays with Mauricio's family. Edy is about to give a toast to everyone but gets a call, it seems that Edy has been getting <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls,</b> and often runs out when he does which gets Anna suspicious that he is having an affair, and cheating on her again (there was one previous incident in the past). Well, when the phone rings during Edy's toast, he stops to answer the call, and having broken the last straw, Anna proclaims that she is divorcing Edy. At first everyone thinks this is a joke, but it is soon evident that Anna is dead serious. Edy reacts with little emotion, saying that if it is what Anna wants then he can't really do anything about it. Mauricio is vehemently against this and tries to get some support from Jesse, whose response is similar to his father's, which angers Mauricio further. At this time, Johnny, Ozzy, Marissa and Fernando excuse themselves as it is a family matter. After more arguing, everyone leaves to vent, except for Sarah, who stays at her seat and continues eating, sort of a gesture of comfort/support to Anna; and the two have a somewhat awkward yet endearing bonding moment.|$|E

30|$|We {{find that}} Southern Abidjan communes - Marcory (ID: 5), Port-Bouët (ID: 6), Treichville (ID: 8), and Koumassi (ID: 9) - stand out, having <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> between each other, given the {{independent}} call volume (see the blue triangle cluster {{on the left}} of Figure  5). Between the southern and northern communes as well as within the northern communes, {{we can see a}} clear scaling relation, i.e. their mutual call volume scales as a function of their individual call volume. Two possible factors may influence the communication within Abidjan: (1) Geography: Abidjan is divided into northern and southern parts by the lagoon. This geographical division may influence the communication patterns. (2) Socioeconomic differences: Northern Abidjan is {{the central part of the}} city, having the business center, administrative area, and upscale residential districts, while two of four communes in Southern Abidjan - Marcory and Treichville - are poor areas and the other two (i.e. Port-Bouët and Koumassi) have an international airport and industrial area. Besides the geographic factor and economic differences of Northern and Southern Abidjan, there could be cultural and ethical differences between them. The homophily principle, namely that people with similar characteristics (e.g. culture, religions, ethnicities, economic status) are more likely to form connections [34] may be at play, where the southern part of Abidjan may consist of more homogeneous population.|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{reliability}} analysis, complex models representing physical situations are used to de-termine failure domain via a given threshold not to be overpassed. These models are often very time consuming and no analytical expression is available. Thus, the evaluation of a failure probability given a threshold or the estimation of a quantile given a targeted probability cannot be done by usual compu-tation tools. Some developments {{have been done in}} two different directions: first the use of sequential Monte-Carlo methods allows to decrease the number of necessary calls to the model ([3], [1]); in this mood Guyader et al. [6] have shown that the optimal algorithm works with limit subsets, ie. fixing the current threshold at the minimum of the working population. Another approach is to use the given computational budget to fit a surrogate model and then to use it instead of the real model to evaluate quantities of interest (see [2], [5] or [4] for examples). Both approaches suffer from several limitations. Sequential Monte-Carlo would still require quite <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> to the limit-state function, while fitted surrogate models can be very far from the original ones without any possibility to control precision. However, in {{the context of}} probability or quantile estimation, only the boundary delimiting failure and safety domains is to be well approximated; especially, no good approximation of the model in both domains is necessary if data points are well classified...|$|E

40|$|Call Admission Control (CAC) {{is one of}} {{the various}} radio {{resource}} management (RRM) congestion control functions in WCDMA systems. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> admission control CAC algorithms are being used to keeping the interference below specific threshold level in order {{to improve the quality of}} service (QoS) and performance of the system. This paper performs deep analysis and evaluates the comprehensive differences between Single and Multi Cell Call Admission Control (SC-CAC and MC-CAC) algorithms in Wireless Coded Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) networks. MATLAB simulation model of a simple WCDMA system with CAC is implemented and analyzed to make a clear comparison between the two CAC algorithms in terms of outage probability, bit error rate (BER) and channel capacity which does not have an exact limit in WCDMA technique. Optimal power allocation water-filling formula is considered to calculate the maximum Shannon capacity over the fading channel. The simulation results show that MC-CAC has better performance scenario than the SC-CAC, therefore <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> maximum values of capacity of Shannon’s channel as well as minimum values of outage probability can be achieved by performing MC-CAC into the network. As a result this will improve the QoS. Three traffic classes (voice, multimedia and video) have been considered along different outage signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) thresholds...|$|R
