5|$|There was no {{criminal}} inquiry. Palestinian police allowed journalists {{to photograph the}} scene the following day, but they gathered no forensic evidence. According to a Palestinian general, there was no Palestinian investigation {{because there was no}} doubt that the Israelis had killed the boy.

5|$|In 1907, the Great White Fleet {{was ordered}} by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt {{to circle the}} world, as a {{demonstration}} of the might of the United States Navy. Kentucky was attached to the Fourth Division of the Second Squadron, and was commanded by Captain Walter C. Cowles, while the fleet as a whole was commanded by Rear Admiral Evans, Kentuckys former flag officer. On 16 December 1907, the fleet saluted the presidential yacht , and left from Hampton Roads. The fleet then sailed south, passing Trinidad and Rio de Janeiro, and going through the Straits of Magellan. From there she passed the west coast of South America, visiting Punta Arenas and Valparaíso, Chile, Callao, Peru, and Magdalena Bay, Mexico. The fleet arrived at San Diego on 14 April 1908 and continued to San Francisco on 6 May. Two months later it arrived at Honolulu, and from there sailed to Auckland, New Zealand, arriving on 9 August.

5|$|Military service {{also allowed}} Ramsey to play {{football}} more regularly, and at a higher standard than before. In late 1940 he was posted to St Austell, on the south coast of Cornwall, where he manned beach defences and became captain of the battalion football team, playing at centre-half or centre-forward as circumstances dictated. After three years in various seaside postings, Ramsey was, in 1943, moved to Barton Stacey in Hampshire, where he came {{under the command of}} a Colonel Fletcher, himself an accomplished footballer.

5|$|The Arch {{demolition}} {{was formally}} {{announced by the}} Minister of Transport, Ernest Marples in July 1961, but immediately drew widespread protest. Experts {{did not believe the}} £190,000 estimate and suspected foreign firms could move the Arch on rollers for substantially less. The Earl of Euston, the Earl of Rosse and John Betjeman all protested against the redevelopment. On 16 October, 75 architects and students staged a formal demonstration against the demolition inside the Great Hall, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> later Sir Charles Wheeler led a deputation to speak with the Prime Minister Harold Macmillan against the demolition. Macmillan replied that as well as the cost, there was no place large enough to put the Arch that would look in keeping with its surroundings. Demolition began on 6 November and was completed within four months.|$|E
5|$|While Glenn {{was on duty}} at Patuxent and in Washington, he read {{everything}} he could find about space.

The pilot would also {{be sent to the}} Naval Air Development Center in Johnsville, Pennsylvania, and would be subjected to high g-forces in a centrifuge for comparison with data collected in the simulator. His request for the position was granted, and he spent several days at Langley <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> in Johnsville for the testing. NASA asked military-service members to participate in planning the mockup of a spacecraft. Since he had participated in the research at Langley and Johnsville, he was sent to the McDonnell plant in St. Louis as a service adviser to NASA's spacecraft mockup board.|$|E

5|$|On 8 February 1916, Weathers enlisted as {{a private}} in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), and was {{initially}} allotted as a reinforcement to the 10th Battalion. However, in June he was re-allotted to the 43rd Battalion, part of the 11th Brigade, 3rd Division, with the regimental number 1153. The 43rd Battalion embarked on HMAT Afric in June 1916, and after a brief stop in the Middle East and transit through France, {{spent the rest of}} the year training in the United Kingdom. The 3rd Division embarked for the Western Front in November, and entered the trenches for the first time in late December. Weathers reported sick in late January 1917, and did not rejoin his unit until late April. He returned to the front lines in time to participate in the first major action his battalion saw during the war, the Battle of Messines, during which the 43rd Battalion incurred 122 casualties. One of those casualties was Weathers, who suffering a gunshot wound to the leg on 10 June. Evacuated to hospital in the United Kingdom, he did not return to his unit until early December. He was promoted to lance corporal on 21 March 1918, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> later his battalion helped blunt the German Spring Offensive, taking up defensive positions between the Ancre and the Somme west of Morlancourt. In late May he required medical treatment following a gas attack near Villers-Bretonneux which caused 230 casualties among the 43rd, and Weathers did not return to duty until mid-June.|$|E
5|$|Symes {{was injured}} during {{pre-season}} but made his second Bournemouth debut {{on the opening}} day of the 2010–11 season against Charlton Athletic as a half-time substitute. Bournemouth lost the game 1–0 but played against ten-men for the last half-hour after defender José Semedo was sent off for a bad tackle on Symes. He was again a substitute for his side's League Cup match before he made his first start the following weekend as Bournemouth defeated Peterborough United 5–1 <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> later he grabbed his first Bournemouth goal with a penalty in a 3–0 win against Tranmere Rovers. However, Symes soon suffered a shoulder injury, which required specialist treatment and kept him out for nearly a month. With Bournemouth's form pushing them towards the top of the league, Symes admitted he would have to prove himself again to manager Eddie Howe. Bournemouth, however, suffered a number of injuries to strikers, and they risked bringing Symes back early. He was brought on as a half-time substitute against Carlisle United and helped lead his side to a 2–0 victory by scoring the second goal. He instantly won a place in Bournemouth's starting team and followed up his goal-scoring performance by netting twice against Exeter City to put Bournemouth second in the table. He soon spent another six weeks on the sidelines because of a shoulder injury before returning in November. His injury problems continued during the winter and he struggled to gain a run of games in the team meaning he did not score again until February at which point he scored in three successive matches.|$|E
