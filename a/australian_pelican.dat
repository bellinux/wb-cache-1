5|$|Widespread across Australia, the <b>Australian</b> <b>pelican</b> has a {{population}} generally estimated at between 300,000 and 500,000 individuals. Overall population numbers fluctuate widely and erratically depending on wetland conditions and breeding success across the continent. The species is assessed as being of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|An origin myth {{from the}} Murri people of Queensland, cited by Andrew Lang, {{describes}} how the <b>Australian</b> <b>pelican</b> acquired its black and white plumage. The pelican, formerly a black bird, made a canoe during a flood {{in order to save}} drowning people. He {{fell in love with a}} woman he thus saved, but she and her friends tricked him and escaped. The pelican consequently prepared to go to war against them by daubing himself with white clay as war paint. However, before he had finished, another pelican, on seeing such a strange piebald creature, killed him with its beak, and all such pelicans have been black and white ever since.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Australian</b> <b>pelican</b> has two {{reproductive}} strategies {{depending on}} the local degree of environmental predictability. Colonies of tens or hundreds, rarely thousands, of birds breed regularly on small coastal and subcoastal islands where food is seasonally or permanently available. In arid inland Australia, especially in the endorheic Lake Eyre basin, pelicans will breed opportunistically in very large numbers of up to 50,000 pairs, when irregular major floods, which may be many years apart, fill ephemeral salt lakes and provide large amounts of food for several months before drying out again.|$|E

5|$|Great white {{pelicans}} {{have been}} observed swallowing city pigeons in St. James's Park in London. Spokeswoman for the Royal Parks Louise Wood opined that feeding on other birds is more likely with captive pelicans that live in a semi-urban environment and are in constant close contact with humans. However, in southern Africa eggs and chicks of the Cape cormorant are an important food source for great white pelicans. Several other bird species have been recorded in the diet of this pelican in South Africa, including Cape gannet chicks on Malgas Island as well as crowned cormorants, kelp gulls, greater crested terns and African penguins on Dassen Island and elsewhere. The <b>Australian</b> <b>pelican,</b> which is particularly {{willing to take a}} wide range of prey items, has been recorded feeding on young Australian white ibis, and young and adult grey teals and silver gulls. Brown pelicans have been reported preying on young common murres in California as well as the eggs and nestlings of cattle egrets and nestling great egrets in Baja California, Mexico. Peruvian pelicans in Chile have been recorded feeding on nestlings of imperial shags, juvenile Peruvian diving petrels and grey gulls. Cannibalism of chicks of their own species is known from the Australian, brown and Peruvian pelicans.|$|E

25|$|About 200 {{species of}} seabird {{live on the}} Australian coast, {{including}} many species of migratory seabird. Australia is {{at the southern end}} of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway for migratory water birds, which extends from Far-East Russia and Alaska through Southeast Asia to Australia and New Zealand. About two million birds travel this route to and from Australia each year. One very common large seabird is the <b>Australian</b> <b>pelican,</b> which can be found in most waterways in Australia. The little penguin is the only species of penguin that breeds on mainland Australia.|$|E

500|$|The {{brown pelican}} usually plunge-dives head-first for its prey, from a height {{as great as}} , {{especially}} for anchovies and menhaden. The only other pelican to feed using a similar technique is the Peruvian pelican, but its dives are typically from a lower height than the brown pelican. The Australian and American white pelicans may feed by low plunge-dives landing feet-first and then scooping up the prey with the beak, but they—as well as the remaining pelican species—primarily feed while swimming on the water. Aquatic prey is most commonly taken {{at or near the}} water surface. Although principally a fish eater, the <b>Australian</b> <b>pelican</b> is also an eclectic and opportunistic scavenger and carnivore that forages in landfill sites as well as taking carrion and [...] "anything from insects and small crustaceans to ducks and small dogs". Food is not stored in a pelican's throat pouch, contrary to popular folklore.|$|E
6000|$|Turning from folk-lore to savage beliefs, {{we learn}} that {{from one end of}} Africa to another the honey-bird, schneter, is said to be an old woman whose son was lost, and who pursued him till she was turned into a bird, which still shrieks his name, [...] "Schneter, Schneter".(1) In the same way the manners of most of the birds known to the Greeks were {{accounted}} for by the myth that they had been men and women. Zeus, for example, turned Ceyx and Halcyon into sea-fowls because they were too proud in their married happiness.(2) To these myths of the origin of various animals we shall return, but we must not forget the black and white <b>Australian</b> <b>pelican.</b> Why is the pelican parti-coloured?(3) For this reason: After the Flood (the origin of which is variously explained by the Murri), the pelican (who had been a black fellow) made a canoe, and went about like a kind of Noah, trying to save the drowning. In the course of his benevolent mission {{he fell in love with}} a woman, but she and her friends played him a trick and escaped from him. The pelican at once prepared to go on the war-path. The first thing to do was to daub himself white, as is the custom of the blacks before a battle. They think the white pipe-clay strikes terror and inspires respect among the enemy. But when the pelican was only half pipe-clayed, another pelican came past, and, [...] "not knowing what such a queer black and white thing was, struck the first pelican with his beak and killed him. Before that pelicans were all black; now they are black and white. That is the reason."(4) ...|$|E

5000|$|The lake, {{with its}} {{associated}} seasonal claypans {{and the nearby}} Barrolka Lakes to the north-east, has been identified by BirdLife International as a 1218 km2 Important Bird Area (IBA) because it has supported over 1% of the world populations of plumed whistling-ducks, sharp-tailed sandpipers and <b>Australian</b> <b>pelicans,</b> {{as well as providing}} habitat for Australian bustards. [...] A large colony of <b>Australian</b> <b>pelicans</b> breeds on an island at the north-eastern end of the lake. The Barrolka Lakes hold several cormorant colonies. Other birds recorded in substantial numbers include hardheads, white-headed stilts, glossy ibises, grey teals, black-tailed nativehens, Australian pratincoles, whiskered terns and Pacific black ducks, with smaller numbers of freckled ducks and white-winged black terns.|$|R
50|$|Fatima Island is a {{small island}} on Cooks River in Tempe, New South Wales, Australia. A low-lying sandbar, it is a refuge for <b>Australian</b> <b>pelicans,</b> egrets and silver gulls. It was named in 1951 for a Portuguese statue of Our Lady of Fátima.|$|R
50|$|Other birds {{breeding}} on {{the islands}} include masked boobies, <b>Australian</b> <b>pelicans,</b> lesser frigatebirds, eastern reef egrets, silver gulls, crested, bridled and lesser crested terns, common noddies, and pied and sooty oystercatchers.

50|$|<b>Australian</b> <b>pelicans</b> follow no {{particular}} schedule of regular movement, simply following {{the availability of}} food supplies. Drought frequently precedes movements. When the normally barren Lake Eyre filled during 1974 to 1976, for example, {{only a handful of}} pelicans remained around the coastal cities: when the great inland lakes dried again, the population dispersed once more, flocks of thousands being seen on the northern coasts. On some occasions, they are simply blown by the wind to new locations. It is a fairly regular visitor to the southern coast of New Guinea, as well as the Bismarck Islands and Solomon Islands. It occurs as a vagrant to Christmas Island, Vanuatu, Fiji, Palau and New Zealand. A population irruption occurred in 1978 into Indonesia, with <b>Australian</b> <b>pelicans</b> reaching Sulawesi, Java and possibly also Sumatra.|$|R
50|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an IBA because it has supported significant numbers of freckled and pink-eared ducks, grey teals, hardheads, <b>Australian</b> <b>pelicans,</b> banded stilts, red-necked avocets and Caspian terns.
