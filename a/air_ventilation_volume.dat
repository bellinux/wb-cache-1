40|$|CONSOL Energy Inc., in {{conjunction}} with MEGTEC Systems, Inc., and the U. S. Department of Energy with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, designed, built, and operated a commercial-size thermal flow reversal reactor (TFRR) to evaluate its suitability to oxidize coal mine <b>ventilation</b> <b>air</b> methane (VAM). Coal mining, and particularly coal mine <b>ventilation</b> <b>air,</b> is {{a major source of}} anthropogenic methane emissions, a greenhouse gas. <b>Ventilation</b> <b>air</b> <b>volumes</b> are large and the concentration of methane in the <b>ventilation</b> <b>air</b> is low; thus making it difficult to use or abate these emissions. This test program was conducted with simulated coal mine VAM in advance of deploying the technology on active coal mine ventilation fans. The demonstration project team installed and operated a 30, 000 cfm MEGTEC VOCSIDIZER oxidation system on an inactive coal mine in West Liberty, WV. The performance of the unit was monitored and evaluated during months of unmanned operation at mostly constant conditions. The operating and maintenance history and how it impacts the implementation of the technology on mine fans were investigated. Emission tests showed very low levels of all criteria pollutants at the stack. Parametric studies showed that the equipment can successfully operate at the design specification limits. The results verified the ability of the TFRR to oxidize {ge} 95 % of the low and variable concentration of methane in the <b>ventilation</b> <b>air.</b> This technology provides new opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by the reduction of methane emissions from coal mine <b>ventilation</b> <b>air.</b> A large commercial-size installation (180, 000 cfm) on a single typical mine ventilation bleeder fan would reduce methane emissions by 11, 000 to 22, 100 short tons per year (the equivalent of 183, 000 to 366, 000 metric tonnes carbon dioxide) ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} new buildings with low-temperature heating systems in terms of energy consumption and thermal comfort, and to pay some attention to energy savings and indoor air quality. To reach this aim, on-site measurements as well as building energy simulations using IDA Indoor Climate and Energy (ICE) 4 were performed. Results show that the investigated buildings with low-temperature heating system could meet the energy requirements of Swedish regulations in BBR (Boverkets byggregler), {{as well as provide}} a good level of thermal comfort. Implementing variable <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ventilation</b> instead of constant flow, i. e. decreasing the <b>ventilation</b> <b>air</b> from 0. 35 to 0. 10 l·s- 1 ·m- 2 during the whole unoccupancy (10 hours), gave up to 23 % energy savings for heating the <b>ventilation</b> <b>air.</b> However, the indoor air quality was not acceptable because VOC (volatile organic compound) concentration was slightly above the acceptable range for one hour after occupants arrive home. So, in order to create acceptable indoor air quality a return back to the normal ventilation requirements was suggested to take place two hours before the home was occupied. This gave 20 % savings for ventilation heating. The results of this study are in line with the European Union 20 - 20 - 20 goal to increase the efficiency of buildings by 20 % to the year 2020.

40|$|RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Hyperpolarized (HP) gas {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) is an advanced imaging technique that provides high-resolution regional information on lung function without using ionizing radiation. Before this modality {{can be considered for}} assessing clinical or investigational interventions, baseline repeatability needs to be established. We assessed repeatability of lung function measurement using HP helium- 3 MRI (HP (3) He MRI) in a small cohort of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined repeatability of HP (3) He MR images of five patients with CF in four scanning sessions over a 4 -week period. We acquired images on a Philips 3. 0 Tesla Achieva MRI scanner using a quadrature, flexible, wrap-around, (3) He radiofrequency coil with a fast gradient-echo pulse sequence. We determined <b>ventilation</b> <b>volume</b> and <b>ventilation</b> defect <b>volume</b> using an advanced semiautomatic segmentation algorithm and also quantified ventilation heterogeneity. RESULTS: There {{were no significant differences in}} total <b>ventilation</b> <b>volume,</b> <b>ventilation</b> defect <b>volume,</b> <b>ventilation</b> defect percentage, or mean ventilation heterogeneity (repeated-measures analysis of variance, P =. 2116, P =. 2825, P =. 2871, and P =. 7265, respectively) in the patients across the four scanning sessions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that total <b>ventilation</b> <b>volume,</b> <b>ventilation</b> defect <b>volume,</b> <b>ventilation</b> defect percentage, and mean ventilation heterogeneity as assessed by HP gas MRI in CF patients with stable health are reproducible over time. This repeatability and the technique 2 ̆ 7 s capability to provide noninvasive high-resolution data on regional lung function without ionizing radiation make (3) He MRI a potentially useful outcome measure for CF-related clinical trials...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work {{was to determine the}} highest energy savings that could be made by implementing sequential <b>air</b> <b>ventilation</b> strategy in an industrial large-scale ripening room, without affecting the final cheese quality. Six ripening trials were run corresponding to different <b>ventilation</b> strategies: continuous <b>air</b> <b>ventilation</b> taken as reference, time-based sequential <b>air</b> <b>ventilation,</b> and temperature-based sequential <b>air</b> <b>ventilation.</b> The results showed that ripening caused substantial cheese respiratory activity that was not significantly affected by either continuous or sequential room ventilation. It was also shown that sequential ventilation had no significant effect on the evolution of cheese ripening microbial flora, biochemical characteristics, or appearance, and thus on the final cheese quality. In the conditions of this study, a specific energy consumption of 3. 6 MJ per kg of cheese was estimated, and for the ripening room investigated, mean electrical energy savings ranged from 41 kWh per day to 170 kWh per day, depending on the strategy implemented.

The counting {{performance of}} two light beam sensors and three camera sensors, all direction sensitive, was simultaneously evaluated at an indoor location. Direction insensitive sensors (two mat sensors and one light beam sensor) were additionally tested as a reference. Bidirectional counting data of free people flow was collected for 36 days in one-hour resolution, including five hours of manual counting. Compared to the manual results, one of the light beam sensors had the most equally balanced directional overall counting errors (4. 6 % and 5. 2 %). The collected data of this sensor was used to model the air transportation energy consumption of visitor counting sensor-based DCV and constant <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ventilation</b> (CAV). The results suggest that potential savings in air transportation energy consumption could be gained with the modeled DCV as its total daily airflow during the test period was 54 % of the total daily airflow of the modeled CAV on average. A virtually real-time control of ventilation could be realized with minute-level counting resolution. Site-specific calibration of the visitor counting sensors is advisable and they could be complemented with presence detectors to avoid unnecessary ventilation during unoccupied periods of the room. A combination of CO 2 and visitor counting sensors could be exploited in DCV to always guarantee sufficient ventilation with a short response time...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{high-rise}} buildings affect the surrounding pedestrian level wind environment. In recent years, awareness and concern has increased about the creation of low wind speed areas around tall buildings which may lead to poor out-door <b>air</b> <b>ventilation.</b> In addition, new building developments are often not restricted to a single building, but comprise a row of buildings, which may have complex plan-forms, and some integrating an extensive podium. This paper aims at providing a fundamental understanding of wind-structure interactions that govern the effects of building dimensions and separations, a row of buildings and podium on the pedestrian level wind environment, for both weak and strong wind conditions, by a series of parametric wind tunnel studies. The study area covered an extensive area which covered up to 400 m downstream of the test buildings. The results show that a single wider building created adverse effects on the natural <b>air</b> <b>ventilation</b> at pedestrian level around the building while a taller building improved the near-field <b>air</b> <b>ventilation</b> conditions.

Exercise increased oxygen uptake 4 -fold. This increase was achieved by more than 2 -fold elevation of both <b>ventilation</b> <b>volume</b> and cardiac output and by greater participation of haemocyanin in oxygen delivery. The elevated <b>ventilation</b> <b>volume</b> resulted entirely from an increase in scaphognathite pumping frequency, while the rise in cardiac output resulted largely from increase in stroke volume. Prior to exercise haemocyanin accounts for less than 50 % of the oxygen delivered to the tissues. Following exercise this increases to over 80 %, the additional oxygen release being mediated by a depression of prebranchial oxygen tension and a substantial Bohr effect resulting from build up of lactate ion in the haemolymph and subsequent fall in pH. These changes allowed % oxygen extraction from branchial water to be maintained at 28 % despite a 2 -fold increase in <b>ventilation</b> <b>volume,</b> and allowed an increase in %. oxygen extraction by the tissues. Despite these changes oxygen supply fell below demand during exercise, and considerable anaerobic metabolism resulted, as evidenced by a 9 -fold increase in haemo-lymph lactate concentration.

40|$|Background: Fish {{are common}} {{intermediate}} hosts of trematode cercariae and their gills can potentially serve as important sites of penetration by these larval stages. We experimentally tested {{the hypothesis that}} <b>volume</b> of <b>ventilation</b> flow across the gills contributes to acquisition of these parasites by fish. We manipulated the intensity of ventilation by using different oxygen concentrations. Methods: Juvenile Oncorhynchus mykiss were individually exposed for 10 minutes to a standard dose of Diplostomum pseudospathaceum cercariae at three levels of oxygen concentration, 30, 60 and 90 %. Ventilation amplitude (measured as a distance between left and right operculum), operculum beat rate, {{and the number of}} cercariae established in the eyes of fish were recorded. Results: Fish reacted to low oxygen concentration with wider expansion of opercula (but not with increasing beat rate), leading to an increase in <b>ventilation</b> <b>volume.</b> As expected, the intensity of infection increased with decreasing oxygen saturation — probably due to a higher exposure to cercariae caused by increased ventilation under low oxygen concentrations. The number of cercariae acquired by an individual fish was positively correlated with ventilation amplitude and with <b>ventilation</b> <b>volume,</b> but not with operculum beat rate. However, even though the infection rate increased under these circumstances, the proportion of larval trematodes successfully establishing in fish eyes decreased with increasing <b>ventilation</b> <b>volume,</b> suggesting that the high flow velocity, although increasing host exposure to cercarial parasites, may interfere with the ability of these parasit es to penetrate their hosts. There was no difference in the behaviour of trematode cercariae exposed to low and high oxygen concentrations. Conclusion: A reduction in oxygen saturation resulted in an increase in <b>ventilation</b> <b>volume</b> across the gills and in doing so an increase in the exposure of fish to cercariae. A significant correlation between <b>ventilation</b> <b>volume</b> and parasitism represents the first experimental evidence that this physiological mechanism generates variation in transmission of parasites to fish hosts. Other factors that modify ventilation flow, e. g. physiological or social stressors, are expected to produce similar effects on the t ransmission success of the parasites penetrating fish hosts using the gills...|$|R
