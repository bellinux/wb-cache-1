50|$|In {{common law}} countries, {{possession}} {{is itself a}} property <b>right.</b> The owner <b>of</b> a property has the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> possession and may <b>assign</b> that <b>right</b> wholly or partially to another who may then also <b>assign</b> the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> possession to a third party. For example, an owner of residential property may <b>assign</b> the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> possession to a property manager under a property management contract who may then <b>assign</b> the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> possession to a tenant under a rental agreement. There is a rebuttable presumption that the possessor of property also has the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> possession, and {{evidence to the contrary}} may be offered to establish who has the legal <b>right</b> <b>of</b> possession to determine who should have actual possession, which may include evidence of ownership (without assignment <b>of</b> the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> possession) or evidence <b>of</b> a superior <b>right</b> <b>of</b> possession without ownership. Possession of a thing for long enough can become ownership by termination of the previous owner's <b>right</b> <b>of</b> possession and ownership rights. In the same way, the passage of time can bring to an end the owner's right to recover exclusive possession of a property without losing the ownership of it, as when an adverse easement for use is granted by a court.|$|R

40|$|Competitive {{advantage}} {{is based on}} a unique nexus of firm-specific investments that creates inimitable quasi-rents. Because of the impossibility of writing complete contracts, the distribution of the quasi-rents is vulnerable to opportunistic and inefficient behavior. This paper discusses two corporate governance models as institutional safeguards: shared ownership that <b>assigns</b> the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> residual control to the firm-specific investors, and thirdparty ownership that <b>assigns</b> the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> residual control to independent fiduciaries. Shared ownership entails higher costs of collective decision-making but lower agency costs than third-party ownership. The paper presents testable propositions, conditional on contextual factors, on which model is better able to incentivize firm-specific investments.

As a consequence of this quarrel the Americans did not return after 1924 and the well-shaped paving blocks of this ownerless area were pulled up and used for road building or for modern buildings in Yalvaç as late as the 1970s.|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a growing {{movement}} to give commercial airliners more freedom in choosing their routes and responsibility for detecting and avoiding conflicts. These "free flight" concepts must contain new rules for <b>assigning</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> way in potential conflict situations. To evaluate the effect of prospective rules, the current paper derives the expected response of agents who exhibit different levels of sophistication. Traditional game theoretic analysis is used to derive the behavior of rational agents. Computer simulations are used to predict the behavior of boundedly rational reinforcement learners. The results reveal that several seemingly reasonable, straightforward right-of-way rules might lead to undesirable outcomes. These problematic results are robust to the assumed level of rationality. It is shown that these problems can be alleviated by using auctions to resolve competition for <b>right</b> <b>of</b> way. Actual or potential applications of this research include the usage of second price auctions to address right-of-way and similar conflict...|$|R
