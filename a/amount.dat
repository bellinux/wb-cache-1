5|$|Advances {{of funds}} – Advances are federal funds {{provided}} to a recipient {{before the program}} activity is performed. Recipients determine the <b>amount</b> needed for a future expenditure (e.g., through budget process) and request the <b>amount</b> {{to the federal government}} (or in the case of subrecipients to the pass-through entity, see Subrecipient Monitoring below). The federal funds received are then expended to perform the specific activity (e.g., purchase good or service or for payroll). However, laws and regulations require recipients to request funds only when it is immediately needed, and recipients must try to minimize the <b>amount</b> of time between the receipts of funds to the actual disbursement. Examples of programs under these funding techniques are the Section 8 program and the Community Development Block Grant program.|$|E

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  3, {{there is no}} clear role of IAA <b>amounts</b> on xylem {{formation}} in juvenile trees. As shown in Figs.  4 and 5, in juvenile trees (stand A trees), there were no significant effects of IAA <b>amounts</b> on latewood width and MFA. In all mature trees except stand C trees in Fig.  5, there were no significant effects of IAA <b>amounts</b> on latewood width and MFA. These results are consistent with those of previous studies on endogenous IAA of mature pine trees [24]. From these results, it was assumed that IAA <b>amounts</b> had no direct effect on xylem formation in each stand. However, in comparison with juvenile and mature trees (Table  2) instead of the relationships in each stand, it was recognized that samples with very large <b>amounts</b> of IAA had wider latewood width and larger MFA than the samples with small <b>amounts</b> of IAA. It was difficult to eliminate the assumption that the very large IAA <b>amounts</b> may have some effects on latewood width and MFA in juvenile wood. In the studies with application of exogenous IAA, the effects of IAA <b>amounts</b> on xylem formation were examined in comparison with branches debudded (very small IAA <b>amounts)</b> and branches debudded and treated apically with exogenous IAA (very large IAA <b>amounts)</b> [11, 14]. In these studies with wide range of applied IAA <b>amounts,</b> an increase in the internal IAA level was positively related to increased tracheid production. In tracheid differentiation, it was also reported that applied exogenous IAA during latewood formation induced earlywood formation, and high concentrations of IAA induced compression wood (large MFA) formation in conifers [9]. In our study, the difference of IAA <b>amounts</b> between juvenile and mature trees was very large, although the difference of IAA <b>amounts</b> of trees in each stand was small (Table  2). Therefore, we assumed that although IAA is essential for xylem formation, the effects of IAA <b>amounts</b> on xylem formation might be significantly recognized only when the IAA <b>amounts</b> vary widely among samples. In juvenile trees, the <b>amounts</b> of other internal regulators may be quite different from those in mature trees. More studies of endogenous phytohormones in juvenile trees should be done for the better understanding of xylem formation in juvenile trees.|$|R
