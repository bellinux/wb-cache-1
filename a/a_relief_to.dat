5|$|In the Northern Ireland Trophy (a ranking {{event in}} this season), he lost 4–5 to Lee in the quarter-finals, {{and in the}} UK Championship, he lost 3–9 to Alan McManus in the second round. A 3–6 defeat by Stephen Hendry in the quarter-finals of the Masters was {{followed}} by his second ranking title, when he defeated Ryan Day 9–4 in {{the final of the}} Malta Cup. After the victory, he said it was <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> get rid of the one-hit wonder label. In his next match, a victory over Jamie Cope in the Welsh Open, he scored centuries in four consecutive frames, becoming only the second player to do this (after Higgins in the 2005 Grand Prix final) and the only person to do so in a best-of-nine match. He went on to lose 3–5 to Maguire in the quarter-finals. In the World Championship, Murphy defeated Stevens 13–12 in the quarter-finals—recovering from 5–11 down and knocking the latter out of the top 16—before losing 16–17 against Mark Selby in the semi-finals.|$|E
5|$|On 5 May 1778, Dr. Lassonne, Marie Antoinette's private physician, {{confirmed}} her pregnancy. On 19 December 1778, the Queen {{gave birth}} to a daughter, who was named Marie-Thérèse Charlotte de France and given the honorific title Madame Royale. The birth of a girl came as <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> the Count of Provence, who kept his position as heir to Louis XVI, since Salic Law excluded women from acceding to the throne of France. However, Louis Stanislas did not remain heir to the throne much longer. On 22 October 1781, Marie Antoinette {{gave birth to}} the Dauphin Louis Joseph. Louis Stanislas and his brother, the Count of Artois, served as godfathers by proxy for Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, the queen's brother. When Marie Antoinette gave birth to her second son, Louis Charles, in March 1785, Louis Stanislas slid further down the line of succession.|$|E

25|$|The Second Council of Lyons and the {{ostensible}} {{union of}} the two Churches did little to avert Catholic aggression, {{while at the same}} time the Orthodox population, led by large parts of the priesthood, denounced Michael VIII as a traitor. His death in 1282 came as <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> many, and his body was denied an Orthodox funeral, as a result of his policies towards Rome.|$|E

25|$|Seen as <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> {{the problem}} of {{overpopulation}} even as early as 1758, and listed as one of Stephen Hawking's reasons for pursuing space exploration, it has become apparent that space colonisation in response to overpopulation is unwarranted. Indeed, the birth rates of many developed countries, specifically spacefaring ones, are at or below replacement rates, thus negating the need to use colonisation {{as a means of}} population control.|$|E
25|$|In the {{isolation}} he felt after the Börne debacle, Marx's friendship came as <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> Heine, {{since he did}} not really like the other radicals. On the other hand, he did not share Marx's faith in the industrial proletariat and remained {{on the fringes of}} socialist circles. The Prussian government, angry at the publication of Vorwärts, put pressure on France to deal with its authors and in January 1845 Marx was deported to Belgium. Heine could not be expelled from the country because he had the right of residence in France, having been born under French occupation. Thereafter Heine and Marx maintained a sporadic correspondence, but in time their admiration for one another faded. Heine always had mixed feelings about communism. He believed its radicalism and materialism would destroy much of the European culture that he loved and admired.|$|E
25|$|As a Queen Dowager, it was <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> Sophia Magdalena to {{withdraw}} from public life. Her brother-in-law, Duke Charles, became regent, and she eschewed a political role. As a widow, Sophia Magdalena lived a withdrawn life. She {{did not wish to}} take part in any representational duties, and she gave up her quarters at Drottningholm Palace to be relieved of them. She lived in the Royal Palace in Stockholm during the winter, and at Ulriksdal Palace during the summer. She lived in a circle of her own court, and seldom entertained any guests other than her lifelong friends Maria Aurora Uggla and Virginia Manderström. It is noted, that although she had hated the male favorites of her spouse during his lifetime, she gave several of them a position in her court as a widow. Sophia Magdalena had a close relationship with her son, King Gustav IV Adolf, who visited her regularly and with whom she shared an interest in religion.|$|E

25|$|The first track, «Babilla» (Puerto Rican jargon for Courage), {{serves as}} the album's intro, and its concept {{is similar to the}} one in his {{previous}} studio album, Desahogo, being <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> all that annoys him, mentioning Donald Trump's xenophobia, sexual video games, religion and people who want to take advantage with his music. «Sentimiento» (Spanish for Feeling) talks about a beautiful and attractive woman who wants a sincere romantic relationship and getting married instead of money and luxury. «Se Escapa» (Spanish for She Escapes) is about respecting and taking care of one's girlfriend in order to not lose her. «Moriré» (Spanish for I Will Die) is a romantic ballad about dying for a woman if she is no longer interesed in one's feelings after a long relationship, using a lot of analogies centered in animals and nature. «El Silencio Mata» (Spanish for Silence Kills) talks about a woman who suffers of domestic violence but needs to talk to someone about that, although she's too scared to denounce his own spouse. «El Corazón Se Pone Bruto» (Spanish for The Heart Gets Stupid) is a moralizing reggaeton about thinking before acting and encouraging the use of preservative, telling two stories about girls that are attracted to men they recently know, both with terrible endings (one girl ends pregnant and the other contracting AIDS). «La Prueba de Farmacia» (Spanish for Pharmacy Test) tells the story about a pregnant teenager who tries to convince her mother that her boyfriend will take care of her whatever happens. «Angelina» tells the story about a low class single mother who have to work as a stripper in order to earn enough money to feed her baby after being abandoned by her boyfriend. «Agua» is about Vico's detention in late 2002 because of porting heroin in his car, complaining about the police and Puerto Rican justice. The term agua (literally water in Spanish) is used in the song as a Puerto Rican jargon referring to the police.|$|E

500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a {{slightly}} negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. Despite noting, [...] "after episodes about butt-crawling and vomiting, it's <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> {{have one in}} which people die when their skin and muscles are fried away by microscopic sea creatures called medusas", Vitaris was critical of the plot, likening it to [...] "cliche" [...] 1970's movies that featured the [...] "obstreperous official insisting the plane must fly or the skyscraper is fire-proof, even when the potential for catastrophe is staring him in the face." [...] Spotnitz later admitted during a Reddit IAmA that the episode was his least-favorite that he had written because [...] "the concept just wasn't clear or compelling enough to sustain the hour." ...|$|E
500|$|Feng {{represented}} Singapore at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, {{and was the}} nation's flagbearer at the Parade of Nations {{segment of}} the opening ceremony. She entered the women's singles competition seeded sixth, and progressed until she was defeated 2-4 by China's Ding Ning in the semi-finals. On 1 August 2012, she overcame Kasumi Ishikawa of Japan 4–0 (11–9, 11–6, 11–6, 11–5) to take the bronze medal, becoming the second Singaporean to win an individual Olympic medal. (The first was Tan Howe Liang who won a silver for weightlifting in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome.) Interviewed after her win, Feng said: [...] "I'm really happy, although I feel it's come a little too suddenly. My form wasn't very good lately, so I didn't dare to carry too much expectations coming into the London Olympics. It was just <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> win." ...|$|E
500|$|Macdonald's {{speech was}} seen as a {{personal}} triumph, but it did little to salvage the fortunes of his government. With eroding support both in the Commons and among the public, Macdonald went to the Governor General, Lord Dufferin on 5 November and resigned; Liberal leader Alexander Mackenzie became the second Prime Minister of Canada. Following the resignation, Macdonald returned home and told his wife Agnes, [...] "Well, that's got along with", and when asked what he meant, told her of his resignation, and stated, [...] "It's <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> be out of it." [...] He is not known to have spoken of the events of the Pacific Scandal again. When Macdonald announced his resignation in the Commons, Conservative and Liberal MPs traded places on the benches of the House of Commons, though one Conservative MP, British Columbia's Amor De Cosmos remained in his place, thereby joining the Liberals.|$|E

500|$|The cast {{changes were}} met with mixed reviews. Mike Hale felt that the {{departure}} of Christopher Meloni was <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> the show, as his [...] "tightly wound" [...] character had a [...] "wack-a-doodle intensity [...] had taken 'SVU' way off track", but still {{found it hard to}} imagine the show without him. He said that Meloni's absence turned the episode [...] "into the best showcase his partner, Olivia, had been given in years." [...] He called the addition of Michael Cutter was [...] "a big gain" [...] for the show, but felt uncertain about the addition of Detective Rollins, writing: [...] "A scene in which she tried to sweet-talk information out of a jailed suspect was the one really weak moment in the episode." [...] TVfanatic.com also had mixed feeling about Detective Rollins, who is [...] supposed to breathe new life into the series, but wrote that Rollins may end up becoming an interesting character.|$|E
500|$|While the Ming dynasty traded horses with Tibet, it {{upheld a}} policy of outlawing border markets in the north, which Laird sees {{as an effort to}} punish the Mongols for their raids and to [...] "drive them from the frontiers of China." [...] However, after Altan Khan (1507–1582)—leader of the Tümed Mongols who overthrew the Oirat Mongol confederation's hegemony over the steppes—made peace with the Ming dynasty in 1571, he persuaded the Ming to reopen their border markets in 1573. This {{provided}} the Chinese with a new supply of horses that the Mongols had in excess; it was also <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> the Ming, since they were unable to stop the Mongols from periodic raiding. Laird says that despite the fact that later Mongols believed Altan forced the Ming to view him as an equal, Chinese historians argue that he was simply a loyal Chinese citizen. By 1578, Altan Khan formed a formidable Mongol-Tibetan alliance with the Gelug that the Ming viewed from afar without intervention.|$|E
500|$|Julian Hirsch's {{cinematography}} can {{be regarded}} as <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> the eyes from the film's gory Holocaust theme, stated Ronnie Scheib (Variety). Jacques Mandelbaum at Le Devoir added that the beauty of scenes such as the arrival of the Romani in caravans in their first scene and the gentle music is a stark contrast to the harsh themes of concentration camps and extermination. Odile Tremblay (Le Monde) made mention of a number of scenes, including the one where Taloche opens a tap to [...] "free" [...] water, and the scene with an abandoned watch implying the ghettos as the best moments of the film. Nick Schager (The Village Voice) stated that the film scores on its aesthetics in sequences depicting key elements, like the one with trains symbolising the Holocaust, and its detailed depiction of the characters' intimate practices, which bring depth to a rather predictable plot. Brian Lafferty (East County Magazine) criticised Julian Hirsch for making the sequences look dull and gloomy with insufficient lighting. The tap scene received a special mention in L'Express review too.|$|E
