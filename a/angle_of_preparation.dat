40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to assess specific methods of teaching the "push off and gliding motion from a wall" for acquisition of posture conversion in the preparation phase. We compared teaching methods that employed a kickboard for developing the ability of posture to conversion autonomously, focusing on posture conversion until both legs reached the wall. We tested the effects of learning from a wide perspective, including gliding distance, biomechanical values, evaluation based on observation by a third party, the completeness of the motion, and subjective evaluation by the swimmer himself.  The subjects were 18 college students (6 men, 12 women) who majored in sports science and had signed a consent form. We divided them into 2 groups of 9 individuals with the same sex ratio, and with the same ability to achieve a given gliding distance. For one group, the instructor taught the "push off and gliding motion from a wall" to allow the students to acquire posture conversion autonomously (autonomous posture conversion (APC) group), and the other group was taught by the instructor (kickboard assistance (KA) group). We compared the 2 groups before and after the instructor 2 ̆ 7 s intervention, and assessed the value of each teaching method from multidimensional aspects, including gliding distance, biomechanical values (joint angle, grounding angle, velocity, time required), observation values (preparation phase, 4 parameters related to partial <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>preparation),</b> and introspection value (4 questions).  In both groups, two-way ANOVA revealed significant main effects before and after the intervention, including gliding distance, velocity, and time required. In the APC group we also found significant interaction between the time required until both legs reached the wall after leaving the floor and until release after both legs had left the floor.

The aim ofthis study was assessment <b>of</b> the convergence <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> tooth <b>preparations</b> for full coverage crownamong dentistry students. Methods and materials: In this observational- cross sectional study, 210 dies from preparedanterior and posterior teeth by under graduate and postgraduate students were randomly selected. In the two groups, the mesiodistal and buccolingual <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> the dies were measured withstereomicroscope and moticam camera and compared with each other. The results were analyzedby t-test via SPSS- 11. 5 software. Results: The total average convergence angle was 23. 8 ± 8. 6 degrees for the preparationsperformed by undergraduate students and 22. 4 ± 9. 0 for postgraduate group. The averageconvergence angle for anterior preparations was 24. 4 ± 8. 1 degrees in undergraduate group and 20. 2 ± 7. 7 degrees in postgraduate group and for posterior preparations it was 23. 6 ± 8. 8 degreesin under graduate group and 24. 1 ± 9. 6 degrees in other group. Differences in convergence anglesof anterior preparations between two groups were significant (p value = 0. 02), but for posteriorpreparations and other preparation were not statistically significant.

40|$|Background: Adhesive {{cementation}} {{is essential}} for the longevity of indirect esthetic restorations. However, polymerization shrinkage of resin cement generates stress, which may cause failures in the tooth-restoration interface. So, understanding of the biomechanics of resin cement is important for predicting the clinical behavior of an esthetic indirect restoration. Aims: To analyze the stresses generated during polymerization shrinkage of self-curing resin cement in ceramic and in indirect resin (IR) restorations, using the finite-element method (FEM). Settings and Design: Numerical study using the finite-element analysis. Materials and Methods: A three-dimensional (3 D) model of a second molar restored with ceramic or IR onlay restoration was designed. The polymerization shrinkage of self-curing resin cement was simulated in FEM software using an analogy between the thermal stress and the resulting contraction of the resin cement. The localization and values of tensile stresses in the dental structure, cement, and adhesive layer were identified. Results: The location and value of the tensile stresses were similar for the two restorative materials. High tensile stresses were identified in the axiopulpal wall and <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> the tooth <b>preparation,</b> with the major stresses found in the cement located in the axiopulpal wall.

40|$|Background: Despite strict guidelines, {{error in}} tooth {{preparation}} was reported {{as one of}} the main causes of failure. Many studies had been performed to evaluate tooth preparation in order to be acquainted with the defects and solve them. Design: A descriptive cross sectional clinical study. Setting: Department of Conservative Dentistry in two different Dental Schools • University of Khartoum /U of K. (governmental) • University of Science and Technology /UST. (Private) Objectives Evaluate the different aspects <b>of</b> tooth <b>preparation</b> for full veneer casting restorations performed by final year dental students. Methods One hundred and seventeen stone dies were evaluated, of which 100 were prepared as abutments for bridges whereas only 17 of them were prepared to receive crowns. Two impression replicas were produced by polyvinyl siloxane (additional silicon); one was sectioned in faciolingual plane and the other in mesiodistal plane. By using a digital caliber occlusal clearance was measured in functional cusp (FC), non functional cusp (NFC) and central fossa (cf) areas. The amount <b>of</b> axial <b>preparation</b> in facial, lingual, mesial, and distal walls were also measured by a digital caliber. Impression silhouettes that were produced by using over head projector were used to measure convergence angle. Working casts were examined for smoothness and evenness <b>of</b> the <b>preparations,</b> existence or absence of additional features of retention and the finishing line was examined for its position and continuity. Results The average taper (convergence <b>angle)</b> <b>of</b> the examined <b>preparations</b> was 39. 98 °, with 44. 1 ° faciolingual, and 35. 8 ° mesiodistal. This is regarded significantly out of ideal range that must be achieved clinically. Occlusal clearance for PFM for both anterior and posterior teeth was acceptable, whereas preparations for full metal restorations were overcut. The amount <b>of</b> axial <b>preparation</b> for PFM was acceptable, and the result was significant; however the amount <b>of</b> facial wall <b>preparation</b> was also acceptable but the result was not statistically significant. In preparations for full metal restoration, the axial walls were over prepared {{with the exception of the}} lingual wall which was ideally prepared for metal. Sub and supra gingival finishing lines were present in equal percentage, however (38. 5 %) <b>of</b> the <b>preparations</b> have mixed finishing lines i. e. areas with subgingival lines and others with supra gingival lines in the same <b>preparation.</b> Most <b>of</b> the students (77. 8 %) were able to maintain continuity of the finishing line all around the preparation, although a significant number of them (19. 7 %) was unable to maintain continuity. All preparations were generally smooth with no sharp angles, and small number <b>of</b> <b>preparations</b> (1. 7 %) had additional retentive features. Conclusions Although students have fresh knowledge about tooth preparation for fixed prosthesis, lack of sufficient preclinical training and their minimal experience affected the quality <b>of</b> tooth <b>preparation</b> especially the convergence angle and finishing line aspects.
