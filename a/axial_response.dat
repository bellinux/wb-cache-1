So, we proposed reflecting optical system to increase signal intensity detected in photon detector. In this paper, we evaluate the proposed reflecting optical system using optical transfer function. To evaluate the proposed system, we used the modeling method based on wave optics. We first calculated point spread function of total system, and calculated optical transfer function of total system. When we use the proposed reflecting optical system, we can increase the signal intensity detected in photon detector. Amount of increased signal intensity depends on the ratio of NA of objective in the original confocal microscopy to NA of objective in reflecting optical system. We also simulated <b>axial</b> <b>response</b> of total system. FWHM of <b>axial</b> <b>response</b> increased a little when using reflecting optical system.

In the long-wavelength limit, the virial expansion makes model-independent predictions for neutrino-nucleon scattering rates and the density S_V and spin S_A responses.

The point of this research is to prove that vibration testing could be used on rope to find damage. For this research, capacitive accelerometers were used. A program ran a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) as the main analysis. From the data produced, it was determined that a damaged rope 2 ̆ 7 s vibration signature was different from the vibration signature of the undamaged rope. There were four different types of vibrations used: an impulse while measuring the <b>axial</b> <b>response,</b> a harmonic excitation while measuring the <b>axial</b> <b>response</b> and both transverses directions.

40|$|To {{investigate}} refractive and <b>axial</b> <b>responses</b> to {{the shift}} of focal plane resulting from the interchange of two monochromatic lights separately corresponding to the peak wavelengths of the cones absorption spectrum in retina, fifty 2 -week-old pigmented guinea pigs {{were randomly assigned to}} five groups based on the mode of illumination: short-wavelength light (SL), middle-wavelength light (ML) and broad-band white light (BL) for 20 weeks, SL for 10 weeks followed by ML for 10 weeks (STM), as well as ML for 10 weeks followed by SL for 10 weeks (MTS). Biometric and refractive measurements were then performed every 2 weeks. After 10 weeks, SL and STM groups became more hyperopic and had less vitreous elongation than BL group. However, ML and MTS groups became more myopic and had more vitreous elongation. After interchange of the monochromatic light, the refractive error decreased rapidly by about 1. 93 D and the vitreous length increased by 0. 14 mm in STM group from 10 to 12 weeks. After that, there were no significant intergroup differences between STM and BL groups. The interchange from ML to SL quickly increased the refractive error by about 1. 53 D and decreased the vitreous length by about 0. 13 mm in MTS group after two weeks. At this time, there were also no significant intergroup differences between MTS and BL groups.

40|$|Most of the {{previous}} research conducted on concrete columns confined with fiber- reinforced polymer (FRP) composites {{has been based on}} small sized specimens. Such sizes can result in the FRP confinement relative to the concrete component to be significantly stiffer than practical retrofit applications. In addition, few investigations have confirmed the validity of extrapolating small-scale specimen results to large-scale specimen results.

This research treats the problem of dynamic pile loading in both steady state and transient conditions, when a non-axial load is applied at the pile head. The objective of the present research is to investigate the effects of non-axial loading on the dynamic <b>axial</b> pile <b>response.</b> A horizontally coupled axial soil reaction (so-called impedance) is first developed in harmonic loading for a soil disk based on analytical and semi-analytical solutions. Then, coupled soil impedances are introduced into the pile equation of motion to solve the pile-soil vibration problem. It is concluded that the soil disk impedance {{as well as the}} <b>axial</b> pile-soil <b>response</b> in coupled analysis are affected by the lateral load depending on the loading intensity, soil parameters, frequency, etc. Transient pile loading as imposed by high strain dynamic loading tests (a pile driving test) are addressed {{in the second part of}} the thesis. Full-scale pile tests from three sites are considered: Limelette (Belgium), Tessenderlo (Belgium), and Loon-Plage (France), where measurements of axial and flexural pile resistance are presented. An analytical solution and a numerical program to take into account the non-axial pile behaviour are proposed. The analytical solution provides a first indication of the transient pile bending in pile driving. The numerical model (called LPDM for Lateral Pile Driving Model) is more advanced than the proposed analytical solution and gives an insight of the whole problem including non-axial pile head impact, axial and lateral pile and soil vibrations. Finally, the hypoplastic soil model for sandy soils is integrated into LPDM to account for large deformations and non-linear behaviour of the soil. Hypoplastic parameters for Brusselian sand, located in the Limelette site, are calibrated based on advanced laboratory tests. The <b>axial</b> pile <b>response</b> recorded from in-situ pile tests is better fitted by LPDM simulations where both low and high strain behaviour of the soil are well captured.
