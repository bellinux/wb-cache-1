6000|$|The man {{shook his}} head. [...] "There is no place," [...] he said sadly, [...] "to which I can in reason ask a ship to carry {{me and my}} family. We have no money, no {{property}} whatever. In any other place I would be far poorer than I am here. My children are not uneducated; my wife and I have done our best for them in that respect, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> books with us. So, as you see, it would be rash in me to leave a home which, rude as it is, shelters and supports my family, to go as paupers and strangers to some other land." ...|$|E
6000|$|He often said, with a {{sound of}} pride: [...] "We don't care a darn for all these would-be social climbers. The wife and I lead a regular Bohemian life.

And one-two of the bunch have got their own cars--I tell you they make {{a whole lot more}} coin than a lot of these society-column guys, even if they don't throw on the agony; and we all pile in and go up to some road-house, and sing, and play the piano, and have a real time." ...|$|E

60|$|A recent {{traveller}} {{has argued}} {{that this is all}} that can be desired, and that no true friend of the poor islander can object to his being taught industry and civilisation. Complaints are all 'missionary exaggeration,' that easy term for disposing of all defence of the dark races, and as to the difficulty of making a man, whose language is not understood, understand the terms of a contract--why, we continually sign legal documents we do not understand! Perhaps not, but we do understand enough not to find ourselves bound to five years' labour when we thought we were selling yams, or taking a pleasure trip. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> means of ascertaining the signification of such documents, and of obtaining redress if we have been deceived.|$|E
6000|$|... "You do us {{something}} too much honour, my lord," [...] said the Templar; [...] "the Alsatians <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> common enemies, and we have, under the rose, some common friends. We {{are in the}} use of blocking all bailiffs out of our bounds, and we are powerfully aided by our neighbours, who tolerate not a rag belonging to them within theirs. Moreover the Alsatians have--I beg you to understand me--the power of protecting or distressing our friends, male or female, who may be obliged to seek sanctuary within their bounds. In short, the two communities serve each other, though the league is between states of unequal quality, and I may myself say, that I have treated of sundry weighty affairs, and have been a negotiator well approved on both sides.--But hark-- hark--what is that?" ...|$|E
60|$|But we {{will let}} these things pass, and call you again to remembrance {{of what is}} in hand: we are now shewing that there be them that name the name of Christ, 'that yet depart not from iniquity,' and in shewing the cause of their not so doing, one was for that the gospel came to them in word only; and the other was, for that though it came to others in power, yet not in power, or in that power, that effectually keepeth some to salvation. Upon this second reason I now am, and am shewing how it comes to pass that they that are under {{the power of the}} things that we have afore discoursed, should {{notwithstanding}} that, return to their vomit again. One cause of this declension, or going back to iniquity, I have just now touched upon, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> more behind.|$|E

60|$|The colour of {{the face}} differs much more widely in the various kinds of monkeys than {{it does in the}} races of man; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> {{reason to believe that the}} red, blue, orange, almost white and black tints of their skin, even when common to both sexes, as well as the bright colours of their fur, and the {{ornamental}} tufts about the head, have all been acquired through sexual selection. As the order of development during growth, generally indicates the order in which the characters of a species have been developed and modified during previous generations; and as the newly- born infants of the various races of man do not differ nearly as much in colour as do the adults, although their bodies are as completely destitute of hair, we have some slight evidence that the tints of the different races were acquired at a period subsequent to the removal of the hair, which must have occurred at a very early period in the history of man.|$|E
60|$|Of this we {{find the}} people of the South, that is, of Arabia and Chaldea were the first, from whence we are told of the Wise Men, that is to say, Magicians, were call'd Chaldeans and Southsayers. Hence also we find Ahaziah the King of Israel sent to Baalzebub the God of Ekron, to enquire whether he should live or die? This some think was a kind of an Oracle, tho' others think it was only some over-grown Magician, who counterfeited himself to be a Devil, and obtain'd upon that Idol-hunting Age to make a Cunning Man of him; and for that Purpose he got himself made a Priest of Baalzebub, the God of Ekron, and gave out Answers in his Name. Thus those merry Fellows in Egypt, Jannes and Jambres, are said to mimick Moses and Aaron, when they work'd the miraculous Plagues upon the Egyptians; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> Instances in Scripture that support this, such as the Witch of Endor, the King Manasses, who dealt with the Devil openly, and had a Familiar; the Woman {{mentioned}} Acts xvi. who had a Spirit of Divination, and who got Money by playing the Oracle; that is, answering doubtful Questions, &c. which Spirit, or Devil, the Apostles cast out.|$|E
60|$|In {{the chapter}} on {{geological}} succession I attempted to show, {{on the principle of}} each group having generally diverged much in character during the long-continued process of modification, how it is that the more ancient forms of life often present characters in some slight degree intermediate between existing groups. A few old and intermediate parent-forms having occasionally transmitted to the present day descendants but little modified, will give to us our so-called osculant or aberrant groups. The more aberrant any form is, the greater must be the number of connecting forms which on my theory have been exterminated and utterly lost. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> evidence of aberrant forms having suffered severely from extinction, for they are generally represented by extremely few species; and such species as do occur are generally very distinct from each other, which again implies extinction. The genera Ornithorhynchus and Lepidosiren, for example, would not have been less aberrant had each been represented by a dozen species instead of by a single one; but such richness in species, as I find after some investigation, does not commonly fall to the lot of aberrant genera. We can, I think, account for this fact only by looking at aberrant forms as failing groups conquered by more successful competitors, with a few members preserved by some unusual coincidence of favourable circumstances.|$|E
