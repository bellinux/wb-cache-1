25|$|A {{salt marsh}} or saltmarsh, {{also known as}} a coastal salt marsh or a tidal marsh, is a coastal {{ecosystem}} in the upper coastal intertidal zone between land and open saltwater or brackish water that is regularly flooded by the tides. It is dominated by dense stands of salt-tolerant plants such as herbs, grasses, or low shrubs. These plants are terrestrial in origin and are essential to the stability of the salt marsh in trapping and binding sediments.

40|$|We {{describe}} the infectivity, virulence, cultivating conditions, and phylogenetic positions of naturally occurring oomycete parasites of Daphnia, invertebrates which {{play a major}} role in <b>aquatic</b> <b>food</b> <b>webs.</b> Daphnia pulex individuals were found dead and covered by oomycete mycelia when exposed to pond sediments. We were able to extract 4 oomycete isolates from dead Daphnia and successfully cultivate them. Using the ITS and LSU rDNA sequences, we further showed these isolates to be distinct species. The isolates were experimentally demonstrated to be parasitic and not saprobic. After exposure to the parasites, Daphnia mortality was much higher than that reported for Daphnia infected with other known parasite species. Therefore, it is likely that oomycete parasites are important selective pressures in natural Daphnia populations. Moreover, their close phylogenetic relationship to parasites of fish and algae suggests that the stability of <b>aquatic</b> <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> (i. e. fish-Daphnia-algae) might be influenced by the shared parasite communities...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} features of ponds is the presence of standing water, which provides habitat for wetland plants and animals. Familiar examples might include water-lilies, frogs, turtles and herons. Often, the entire margin of the pond is fringed by wetland, and these wetlands support the <b>aquatic</b> <b>food</b> <b>web,</b> provide shelter for wildlife, and stabilize the shore of the pond. Some grazing animals like geese and muskrats consume the wetland plants directly as a source of food. In many other cases, however, the pond plants fall into the water and decay. A large number of invertebrates then feed on the decaying plants, and these invertebrates provide food for wetland species including fish, dragonflies and herons. The open water may allow algae to grow, and these algae may support yet another food web that includes aquatic insects and minnows. A pond, therefore, may have combinations of three different food webs, one based on larger plants, one based upon decayed plants, and one based upon algae. Hence, ponds often have a large number of different animal species using the wide array of food sources. They therefore provide an important source of biological diversity in landscapes.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHuman {{activities}} and natural disturbances often result in significant shifts in both trophic and energy pathways, which then translate into {{changes in the}} benthic <b>food</b> <b>web</b> structure.

50|$|Historically, {{more than}} 85 {{percent of the}} {{phosphorus}} going into Lake Apopka was from farms on the lake’s north shore. To combat this problem, the District and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) purchased {{almost all of the}} farms for restoration between 1988 and 2001. This contributed to reducing discharges of excessive nutrients from farms to the lake. The 1996 Lake Apopka Improvement and Management Act authorized the District to set a phosphorus concentration target. Subsequently, the District established a restoration phosphorus-loading target for Lake Apopka of 15.9 metric tons of phosphorus per year. This represents a 75 percent reduction from 1989-1994 farming discharges. The target was later adopted as a total maximum daily load (TMDL) for the lake, which has a goal of attaining an in-lake total phosphorus concentration of 55 parts per billion (ppb). Restoration of wetlands on the NSEA can reduce storm water discharges to Lake Apopka and related nutrient loading, accelerating the enhancement of the lake. The innovative restoration and remediation plan for the NSEA focuses on infrastructure requirements, soil inversion and soil amendment work needed to prepare the system for wetland restoration. The soil inversion process was developed as a remediation method to address the high levels of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) found in organic surface soils (the top 30 centimeters (cm) of soil). The pesticides remain in the organic soils from years of farm pesticide applications. The inversion process used modified farm equipment to plow up to one meter deep and essentially flip the soil, bringing up uncontaminated soil to the surface and covering the contaminated surface layer of soil. The work was completed in May 2009 and it helped ensure that OCPs were unable to enter the food chain. The inversion process reduced contaminants in the biologically active soil layer to safe levels on about 1,600 hectares (4,000 acres) in the NSEA. Soils in the NSEA also contained excess nutrients such as phosphorus due to many years of agricultural production. Applying a “soil amendment,” which is a drinking water treatment residual, helps to trap excess phosphorus in soils. This helps mitigate the release of phosphorus from the soil to overlying water when the area is reflooded. The soil amendment was applied to about 2,800 hectares (7,000 acres) in the NSRA and was mostly complete in 2009. As infrastructure construction is completed for each phase, a biological assessment is prepared for review and submitted to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). With USFWS concurrence, saturation and restoration flooding begins. The infrastructure is designed to help establish full wetland habitat {{with a wide range of}} water levels. The infrastructure also allows water transfer among different areas within the NSEA to minimize the need to discharge waters to the lake. As each new phase is flooded and naturally populated with wildlife, fish samples are routinely collected and analyzed to ensure that pesticide levels in their tissues are below established safe levels for fish-eating birds. Newly flooded phases are carefully monitored for at least one year to ensure that any accumulation of pesticides through the <b>aquatic</b> <b>food</b> <b>web</b> do not present a risk to water birds. In addition, weekly bird surveys are conducted to monitor usage and to ensure that problems are detected quickly. As of January 2011 nearly 4,000 hectares (9,870 acres) are in various stages of reflooding.|$|E
