40|$|AIM: To {{research}} the correlation factor of the anterior segment values of eyes with different axial lengths. METHODS: In this study, 697 cases 697 eyes were included. According to axial length we divided {{all the cases}} into short axial length group, normal axial length group, mild long axial length group, moderate long axial length group and severe long axial length group. The relevant indicators of the anterior segment values of patients in the five groups was comparatively analyzed. RESULTS: In the short axial length group, the anterior chamber volume(ACV) showed <b>a</b> significantly <b>negative</b> correlation with age; anterior chamber depth(ACD) showed <b>a</b> significantly <b>negative</b> correlation with age. In the normal axial length group, the ACV showed <b>a</b> significantly <b>negative</b> correlation with age and a significantly positive correlation with axial length(AXL); the anterior chamber angle(ACA) showed <b>a</b> significantly <b>negative</b> correlation with age and a significantly positive correlation with AXL, and a significantly positive correlation with corneal curvature; the ACD showed <b>a</b> significantly <b>negative</b> correlation with age and a significantly positive correlation with AXL. In the mild long axial length group, the ACV showed <b>a</b> significantly <b>negative</b> correlation with age and a significantly positive correlation with AXL, and <b>a</b> significantly <b>negative</b> correlation with corneal curvature; the ACA showed <b>a</b> significantly <b>negative</b> correlation with age and a significantly positive correlation with AXL, and a significantly positive correlation with corneal curvature; the ACD showed <b>a</b> significantly <b>negative</b> correlation with age and a significantly positive correlation with AXL. In the moderate long axial length group, the ACV showed <b>a</b> significantly <b>negative</b> correlation with age; the ACA showed a significantly positive correlation with AXL; the ACD showed a significantly positive correlation with AXL. In the severe long axial length group, the ACV showed <b>a</b> significantly <b>negative</b> correlation with age. There {{were no significant differences}} on ACV, ACA and ACD among mild long axial length group, moderate long axial length group and severe long axial length group(P > 0. 05), while the difference between other groups was significant(P CONCLUSION: There has a correlation between the anterior chamber values(ACV, ACA, ACD) age and AXL for eyes which AXL were 22 - 27 mm, while the correlation would disappear as the AXL became shorter or longer. There was a significant growth trend of anterior chamber values for eyes with AXL < 27 mm...|$|R
