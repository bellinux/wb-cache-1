40|$|OBJECTIVE—Dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 (DPP- 4) inhibitors are a {{new class}} of {{antidiabetic}} drugs. They inactivate incretin hormones but also have many other effects throughout the body, among which are effects on the immune system. This might result in an increased infection risk. This study assessed the association between use of DPP- 4 inhibitors and the reporting of infections. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—A nested case-control was conducted using VigiBase, the World Health Organization-Adverse Drug Reactions (WHO-ADR) database. The base cohort consisted of ADRs for antidiabetic drugs (<b>Anatomical</b> <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>Chemical</b> <b>code</b> A 10). Cases were defined as ADRs of infection according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) classification system. All other ADRs were considered controls. Reporting odds ratios (RORs) were calculated to estimate the strength of the association between different classes of antidiabetic drugs and the reporting of infections. RESULTS—We identified 305, 415 suspected ADRs involving antidiabetic drugs in 106, 469 case reports, of which 8, 083 involved DPP- 4 inhibitors monotherapy. Overall, the reporting of infections was higher for patients using DPP- 4 inhibitors compared with users of biguanides (ROR 2. 3 [95 % CI 1. 9 – 2. 7]).

Objectives: To identify the prevalence of neuropsychiatric disorders, especially DP and CD, on a sample of nursing home residents, relating this prevalence with some aspects of the demographics and psycho pharmacotherapy. Methods: 48 elders from two different nursing homes were selected. The collection of demographic and pharmacological data was made utilizing medical records. The medication was classified according to the <b>Anatomical</b> <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>Chemical</b> <b>Code</b> (ATC) criteria. The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS 30) and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) tests were utilized to determine the prevalence of DP and CD. Results: It was observed in the sample a high incidence of DP and CD among the researched elders. More schooling individuals tend to present less CD. Individuals with less CD indicatives present less symptomatology for DP. Of all the researched elders, 54, 2 % are submitted to psycho pharmacotherapy.

A cross-sectional {{study was conducted}} using data {{on the use of}} anxiolytics, sedatives, and hypnotics from the Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency, Brazil, 2010. For each prescription, prescribed drugs and the prescribed amount were identified. Prescribed medications were classified according to <b>Anatomical</b> <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>Chemical</b> <b>code.</b> We calculated the number of Defined Daily Doses (DDD) for anxiolytics, sedatives, and hypnotics by code, their mean DDD, and DDD per inhabitant per year. Results. There were 16, 436 prescriptions dispensed, including anxiolytics, sedatives, and hypnotics. These prescriptions corresponded to 3, 555, 780. 50 [*]mg, distributed as 2, 286, 200. 50 [*]mg (64. 30 %) of anxiolytics and 1, 269, 580. 00 [*]mg (35. 70 %) of sedatives and hypnotics. This amount allowed treating approximately 474, 106 individuals (number of DDD). The anxiolytics most frequently dispensed were bromazepam (25. 30 %), alprazolam (19. 19 %), and diazepam (15. 60 %). Sedatives and hypnotics mostly prescribed were zolpidem (9. 55 %), midazolam (6. 99 %), and flunitrazepam (2. 14 %).

Background: The association of aspirin use and nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) risk is unclear. This study determined whether use of any individual compound is associated with ALS risk by conducting a total population-based case-control study in Taiwan. Methods: A total of 729 patients with newly diagnosed ALS who had a severely disabling disease certificate between January 1, 2002, and December 1, 2008, comprised the case group. These cases were compared with 7290 sex-, age-, residence-, and insurance premium-matched controls.

40|$|Recent {{epidemiological}} studies have revealed very {{high rates of}} antipsychotic, antidepressant and anxiolytic and sedative-hypnotic drug use among Australians [1 – 3]. These large-scale analyses supplement previous data across a number of settings demonstrating higher rates of use in those over 60 years, with highest rates in those 80 – 95 years of age (Figure 1). This issue is of growing concern, given the increasing size of the elderly population and the greater vulnerability of older people to adverse effects of drugs and to interactions among the multiple drugs often prescribed. On {{the basis of these}} new data and signifi cant previous fi ndings, we argue for the urgent need to review psychotropic prescribing among the elderly on the grounds of safety and cost [4].

40|$|Abstract Background Few {{studies have}} {{examined}} the longitudinal changes in the patterns, selection, and utilization of treatments for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in routine clinical practice since the introduction of imatinib. Therefore, we investigated the trends in CML therapy, including changes, patterns, and persistence to imatinib therapy among patients with newly diagnosed CML. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of 11 [*]years of claims data for patients with newly diagnosed CML included in the Taiwan National Health Insurance program. Pharmacy and diagnosis claims for newly diagnosed CML recorded between 1997 and 2007 [*]year were extracted from the database. Annual overall use, new use of CML therapy, and persistence to imatinib therapy were estimated. The <b>Anatomical</b> <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>Chemical</b> <b>codes</b> for CML therapy [i. e., imatinib and conventional therapy: busulfan, hydroxyurea, interferon-α (IFNα), and cytarabine], and the process code for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were used to categorize treatment patterns. Associations with patients characteristics were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression. Results Overall, the proportion of patients with newly diagnosed CML to all patients with CML increased by approximately 4 -fold between 1998 and 2007. There were steady increases in the proportions of all treated patients and those starting therapy from 2003 to 2007. Fewer comorbid conditions and lower severity of CML were associated with treatment initiation. Medication persistence varied according to treatment duration, as 38. 7 % patients continued imatinib for[*]≥[*] 18 [*]months without interruption but only 7. 7 % continued imatinib for[*]≥[*] 5 [*]years. Factors associated with persistence to imatinib therapy were removal of the need for prior authorization for imatinib, and prior use of hydroxyurea and IFNα, whereas having undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation led to reduced likelihood of persistence to imatinib therapy. Conclusion Treatment decisions for patients with CML changed over time in routine clinical practice. Our findings suggest that clinicians are increasingly adopting the recommendations of international treatment guidelines for CML. However, persistence to imatinib therapy is still substantially below the recommended level based on current evidence for its efficacy. Our study also highlights the need to improve treatment persistence and effectiveness of imatinib over the long term. </p...|$|R

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are not recommended for long-term use and a careful surveillance to monitor for toxicity and efficacy is critical. This study aims to assess: 1) the pattern of use of NSAIDs and opioids in a population covered by a cloud-based pharmacovigilance surveillance system; and 2) potential inappropriate use. A retrospective 18 -months systematic analysis on patients’ pain treatment was performed.

The chance of an antimicrobial prescription was 1.07 (95  % CI 1.04 – 1.10) higher on weekend days compared to weekdays. This was reflected in increased prescriptions for ampicillin, co-amoxiclav, nitrofurantoin, quinolones and macrolides. However, if antimicrobials were prescribed, no significant differences were observed between weekdays and weekend among the different classes of antimicrobials. GPs prescribe relatively more antimicrobials during the weekend compared to weekdays. However, the patterns of antimicrobial prescribing did not differ according to the day of prescription.|$|R

Studi Analisi Valutazioni Economiche, Milan, 3 CINECA &ndash; Bologna; 4 Centro Aterosclerosi GC Descovich, Dipartimento di Medicina Interna e dell&# 39;Invecchiamento, University of Bologna, Bologna, ItalyBackground: Type 2 {{diabetes}} {{has become}} a disease with a high economic and social impact. The ARNO Observatory is a clinical data warehouse consisting {{of a network of}} local health care units (ASL) scattered throughout the Italian territory which collects data on health care consumption for about 10. 5 million people. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the use of antidiabetic drugs with particular reference to type of treatment. The analyses were carried out on a sample of 169, 375 patients treated with oral blood glucose-lowering drugs in 2008 from a total population of 4, 040, 624 health care beneficiaries at 12 local health care units in the ARNO Observatory. Methods: Patients were considered &ldquo;on treatment with oral blood glucose-lowering drugs&rdquo; if they had received at least one prescription of an antidiabetic drug (<b>Anatomical</b> <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>Chemical</b> <b>code</b> A 10 B) during 2008. The patients were divided into three treatment groups, ie, monotherapy, fixed-combination drugs, and dual therapy. The following indicators were assessed: number of patients treated with an oral antidiabetic drug, mean number of hospitalizations, mean number of specialist examinations, and mean expenditure per treated patient. Adherence was assessed using the medication possession ratio indicator (MPR). Results: Patients treated with oral blood glucose-lowering drugs comprised 4. 2 % of the investigated population, and had an average age of 68. 9 years. The mean annual number of hospitalizations was lower in the dual therapy group (298 versus 328 per 1000 patients in the sample), while the average number of specialist examinations was lower in the fixed-combination group (30. 1 versus 35. 1). Patients on monotherapy showed a better percentage of adherence for glimepiride (70. 5 %) and pioglitazone (70. 4 %), whereas the best adherence in the fixed-combination therapy group was recorded for metformin + pioglitazone (75. 5 %). The average annual cost per diabetic patient was &euro; 2388, with differences between the monotherapy (&euro; 2321), fixed-combination (&euro; 2270), and dual therapy (&euro; 2465) groups. Fixed combination therapy involved a lower mean expenditure for insulin, other drugs, and specialist and diagnostic care. Thiazolidinediones (such as pioglitazone) showed the lowest average annual cost per patient among the monotherapies, with a marked decrease in costs for hospitalization, specialist care, and diagnostics. Conclusion: The results of our study should be extended to other regional/national reference local health care units in order to define and compare average standard costs per pathology throughout the wide sample considered in this research work. Appropriate drug prescribing is of critical importance in order to achieve therapeutic objectives and to optimize the use of resources in modern health care systems.

40|$|Background M- 3 muscarinic {{receptor}} antagonism {{has been}} associated with glucose intolerance and disturbance of insulin secretion. Objective Our objective was to examine the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) in patients using antidepressants with and without M- 3 muscarinic receptor antagonism (AD_ antaM(3) and AD_nonantaM(3), respectively). Methods We designed a case-control study using a pharmacy prescription database. We selected a cohort of patients who initiated antidepressant use between the ages of 20 and 40 years and who did not receive any anti-diabetic prescriptions at baseline. Cases were defined as those who developed T 2 DM [i. e., receiving oral anti-diabetic medication, <b>Anatomical</b> <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>Chemical</b> (ATC) <b>code</b> A 10 B] during the follow-up period (1994 - 2014), and ten random controls were picked for each case from the cohort of patients who did not develop T 2 DM. Results A total of 530 cases with incident T 2 DM and 5300 controls were included. Compared with no use of antidepressants during the previous 2 years, recent (within the last 6 months) exposure to AD_antaM(3) was associated with a moderately increased risk of T 2 DM: adjusted odds ratio 1. 55 (95 % confidence interval 1. 18 - 2. 02). In the stratified analyses, this association was dose dependent (> 365 defined daily doses) and significant for patients who were in the younger age group (Conclusion Our results suggest that exposure to AD_antaM(3) was associated with the development of T 2 DM among antidepressant users...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{information}} that is available when marketing authorizations are approved is limited. Pharmacovigilance has an important role during the postauthorization period, and alerts published by national authorities allow health care professionals to be informed about new data on safety profiles. This study therefore sought to analyze all safety alerts published by the Portuguese National Authority of Medicines and Health Products I. P. (INFARMED). METHODS: We conducted an observational study of all alerts published on the INFARMED website from January 2002 through December 2014. From the data included in the alerts, the following information was abstracted: active substance name (and trade name), event {{that led to the}} alert, and the resulting safety measures. Active substances were classified according to the <b>Anatomical</b> <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>Chemical</b> (ATC) <b>code.</b> FINDINGS: A total of 562 alerts were published, and 304 were eligible for inclusion. The musculoskeletal system was the ATC code with more alerts (n = 53), followed by the nervous system (n = 42). Communication of the information and recommendations to the health care professionals and the public in general was the most frequent safety measure (n = 128), followed by changes in the Summary of the Product Characteristics and package information leaflet (n = 66). During the study period, 26 marketing authorizations were temporarily suspended and 10 were revoked. IMPLICATIONS: The knowledge of the alerts published during the postmarketing period is very useful to the health care professionals for improving prescription and use of medicines and to the scientific community for the development of new researches.

40|$|Background: There is a {{relation}} between amounts of antibiotic uses {{and creation of}} resistant bacteria. Due to the critical role of antibiotics and increasing trend of resistance in developing countries, comprehensive methods of antibiotic use is necessary to limit the threat of resistant microorganisms. In this study we compare antibiotics consumption by Defined Daily Dose (DDD) per 100 bed-days in teaching and private hospitals during six months in Tabriz, Iran. Methods: Four university hospitals and one private hospital were included in this study. Amount of their antibiotic consumption obtained from the hospital pharmacies. <b>Anatomical</b> <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>Chemical</b> (ATC) <b>code</b> J 01 was explained as defined daily doses per 100 bed-days (DDD/ 100) according to the ATC/DDD classification. The amount of consumption was assessed with DDD per 100 bed-days in six months. Results: Total antibacterial consumption was higher in Emam reza (119. 62 DDD/ 100) than other hospitals. Cephalosporins were {{the most widely used}} antibiotic in all five hospitals with the total DDD per 100 bed-days of 53. 74, 58. 51, 46. 09, 19. 75 and 15. 16 for Emam reza, Shohada, Sina, Shahriar and Shahid madani,respectively. Cefazoline had highest use among cephalosporins consumption in all hospitals except Shahriar. Ciprofloxacin was among the five most used antibiotics in all hospitals. Conclusion: Although the pattern of antibacterial consumption was almost logical in different categories of hospitals, the total amount of DDD per 100 bed-days was dramatically more than developed countries. Specific strategies should be employed in infection control development and engage rational antibiotic utilization in order to reduce future resistant strains and increase antimicrobial efficacy...|$|R

Meera Tandan 1 *, Sinead Duane 1 and Akke Vellinga 1, 2 Inappropriate antimicrobial prescribing {{contributes to}} the global spread of antimicrobial resistance. The pending weekend with changed availability of general practitioners (GP) and increased patient concern may increase the intention to prescribe antimicrobials. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyse variation in antimicrobial prescribing between weekdays and weekend in Irish general practice. All prescribing data over a 15 month period was obtained from the 30 practices participating in the Supporting the Improvement and Management of Prescribing for urinary tract infection (SIMPle) study. Antimicrobials were classified using <b>anatomical</b> <b>therapeutic</b> <b>chemical</b> classification <b>code</b> guidelines. Prescribing of antimicrobials per total number of prescriptions was compared between weekdays (Mon-day to Thursday) and the weekend (Friday to Sunday). Antimicrobials were generally more often prescribed during weekends; the antimicrobial prescribing rate was greater by 9. 2 % on Friday compared to average prescribing on other weekdays (21. 4 vs. 19. 6 %). The chance of an antimicrobial prescription was 1. 07 (95 % CI 1. 04 – 1. 10) higher on weekend days compared to weekdays.

40|$|PURPOSE: Our {{purpose was}} to {{investigate}} the feasibility of pharmacy-initiated pharmacogenetic (PGt) screening in primary care with respect to patient willingness to participate, quality of DNA collection with saliva kits, genotyping, and dispensing data retrieved from the pharmacy. METHODS: Polypharmacy patients aged > 60 years who used at least one drug with <b>Anatomical</b> <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>Chemical</b> (ATC) <b>code</b> N 06 AA 01 -N 06 AX 19 (antidepressants), A 02 BC 01 -A 02 BC 05 (proton-pump inhibitors), N 05 AA 01 -N 05 AH 04 (antipsychotics), or C 07 AB 02 (metoprolol) in the preceding 2 years were randomly selected. DNA was collected with saliva kits and genotyped for CYP 2 D 6 and CYP 2 C 19 with the AmpliChip. Pharmacy dispensing records were retrieved and screened for drugs interacting with the patient's CYP 2 D 6 and CYP 2 C 19 genotype by using the evidence-based PGt guidelines from the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group. RESULTS: Out of the 93 invited patients, 54 (58. 1 %) provided informed consent. Nine saliva samples (16. 7 %) contained too little DNA. Call rates for CYP 2 D 6 and CYP 2 C 19 were 93. 3 % and 100 %, respectively. Frequencies of genotype-predicted phenotype were 2. 4 %, 38. 1 %, 54. 8 %, and 4. 8 % for CYP 2 D 6 poor metabolizers (PM), intermediate metabolizers (IM), extensive metabolizers (EM), and ultrarapid metabolizers (UM) respectively. For CYP 2 C 19 genotype-predicted phenotype, frequencies were 2. 2 %, 15. 6 %, and 82. 2 % for PM, IM, and EM, respectively.

Methods A retrospective case-control study over 3 years (2002 - 2004). Data for depressed patients (n = 7128) and non-depressed matched controls (n = 23772) were available from an electronic medical record system of 20 general practices organized in one large primary care organization in the Netherlands. Matching was based on year and month of birth, sex and general practitioner. Diabetes, diabetes regimen (i. e. oral glucose medication, insulin or both) and co-morbidity were defined using <b>Anatomical</b> <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>Chemical</b> classification <b>codes</b> of delivered medication. Results The prevalence of diabetes was 5. 5 % (n = 393) among depressed patients, which was 2. 6 times higher than in non-depressed matched controls where the figure was 2. 1 % (n = 494; P < 0. 001). Diabetes regimen, i. e. the proportions of subjects on oral glucose medication, insulin or both did not differ among depressed patients with diabetes (51, 27 and 22 %, respectively) compared with non-depressed patients with diabetes (51, 30, 19 %; P = 0. 53). Co-morbidity was significantly more prevalent among depressed patient with diabetes than in non-depressed patients with diabetes. Conclusions Compared with non-depressed matched controls, adults with treated depression have almost three times higher rates of diabetes.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{estimate}} the prevalence and cost of illness of asthma in Germany by retrospectively analysing routine health insurance data. This analysis investigated claims data from all insured persons of six large sickness funds. Insurants with asthma were identified via the International Classification of Diseases (ninth revision) diagnosis and the <b>Anatomical</b> <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>Chemical</b> Classification System <b>Code</b> for regular medication prescriptions. Costs for hospital care, medication and sick benefit were taken from claims data. Costs for rehabilitation, premature death and early retirement were estimated using the human capital approach and data from national statistics. Prevalence of asthma in the German statutory health insurance was 6. 34 %. Total costs for asthma, including direct and indirect costs, were calculated at J 2. 74 billion during 1999. The prevalence of asthma in the German statutory health insurance has previously been estimated to be 4 – 6 %. The results of this large study show the prevalence of asthma in the German social insurance system to be, 6 %. The study also indicates that there is room for substantial savings in the German social insurance system, with indirect costs amounting to 74. 8 % of total costs and payment of sick benefits through the sickness funds amounting to 58. 3 % of indirect costs. These costs may be reduced with better asthma control in patients...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Chronic {{diseases}} are an increasing threat to people’s health {{and to the}} sustainability of health organisations. Despite the need for routine monitoring systems {{to assess the impact}} of chronicity in the population and its evolution over time, currently no single source of information has been identified as suitable for this purpose. Our objective was to describe the prevalence of various chronic conditions estimated using routine data recorded by health professionals: diagnoses on hospital discharge abstracts, and primary care prescriptions and diagnoses. Methods The ICD- 9 -CM codes for diagnoses and <b>Anatomical</b> <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>Chemical</b> (ATC) <b>codes</b> for prescriptions were collected for all patients in the Basque Country over 14 years of age (n= 1, 964, 337) for a 12 -month period. We employed a range of different inputs: hospital diagnoses, primary care diagnoses, primary care prescriptions and combinations thereof. Data were collapsed into the morbidity groups specified by the Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups (ACGs) Case-Mix System. We estimated the prevalence of 12 chronic conditions, comparing the results obtained using the different data sources with each other and also with those of the Basque Health Interview Survey (ESCAV). Using the different combinations of inputs, Standardized Morbidity Ratios (SMRs) for the considered diseases were calculated for the list of patients of each general practitioner. The variances of the SMRs were used as a measure of the dispersion of the data and were compared using the Brown-Forsythe test. Results The prevalences calculated using prescription data were higher than those obtained from diagnoses and those from the ESCAV, with two exceptions: malignant neoplasm and migraine. The variances of the SMRs obtained from the combination of all the data sources (hospital diagnoses, and primary care prescriptions and diagnoses) were significantly lower than those using only diagnoses. Conclusions The estimated prevalence of chronic diseases varies considerably depending of the source(s) of information used. Given that administrative databases compile data registered for other purposes, the estimations obtained must be considered with caution. In a context of increasingly widespread computerisation of patient medical records, the complementary use of a range of sources may be a feasible option for the routine monitoring of the prevalence of chronic diseases. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objectives Antimicrobial {{resistance}} {{is becoming a}} growing threat to public health worldwide. Inappropriate prescriptions and use of antibiotics are known {{to contribute to the}} problem. Within Europe there are wide variations in antibiotic use. Especially with paediatric patients, prevalence is known to be greater. This study set out to examine the prevalence and most frequent prescribed types between out-patient children and adolescents from two bordering regions of Germany and the Netherlands. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study comparing antibiotic prescriptions in the Northern Netherlands (postal codes 9 xxx, Groningen/Drenthe) and North-West Germany (postal codes 26 xxx; Niedersachsen). Both regions have about 1 million inhabitants and border on each other (Figure 1). Data comprises 2010 and focused on ages 0 - 17 years. Antibiotics were selected based on the <b>Anatomical</b> <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>Chemical</b> (ATC) <b>code</b> J 01 in the outpatient setting. Dutch data were derived from pharmacy dispensing data of the InterAction Database (www. IADB. nl). The IADB comprises all prescriptions from approximately 470, 000 persons in north-eastern Netherlands (of them about 263, 000 in postal codes 9 xxx). German data were derived from claims data of a large statutory health insurance fund, the BARMER GEK, representing approximately 8. 4 million persons nationwide (of them about 104, 000 in postal codes 26 xxx). Results The proportion of children and adolescents receiving at least one antibiotic course was higher in North-West Germany (38. 9 %) compared to the Northern Netherlands (29. 8 %). There were regional variations ranging between 27. 0 - 36. 4 % in the Northern Netherlands and 35. 1 - 44. 1 % in North-West Germany. The proportion with prescriptions was highest in children aged 0 - 2 years (Northern Netherlands vs. North-West Germany: 43. 1 % vs. 49. 9 %) and those aged 3 - 6 years (37. 4 % vs. 54. 8 %). Distribution of substances varied between the two regions. Amoxicillin was the most prescribed substance in both regions, 49. 6 % of all prescriptions in the Netherlands versus 21. 1 % in Germany. Most profound difference was second generation cephalosporins which comprised 25 % of the prescriptions in Germany and less than 0. 1 % in the Netherlands...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The 1995 - 2005 {{balance of}} EMEA {{activities}} {{in the field of}} paediatric medicines was evaluated, taking into account the number both of drugs authorised for children and paediatric studies supporting the Marketing Authorisation (MA). Methods: Data on drugs authorised by EMEA were extracted from EPARs (European Public Assessment Reports). Active substance, year of approval, <b>anatomical,</b> <b>therapeutic</b> and <b>chemical</b> (ATC) <b>code,</b> indication, orphan status, ages, and registrative clinical studies characteristics were assessed. Results: The percentage of authorised substances for paediatrics is 33. 3 %. This percentage decreased or increased when different subsets of medicines were considered [medicines for children under 2 years (23. 4 %), N-ATC code drugs (6 %) and orphan drugs (46. 4 %) ]. A total of 165 trials were included in the MA dossiers of 51 drugs at the time of approval, and additional 22 studies were added to the dossiers of 12 active substances submitted for paediatric variations. PK and Efficacy/Safety studies were performed for 32 (52 %) active substances, while either one PK or one Efficacy/Safety study was carried out for 43 (69 %) and 45 (73 %) substances, respectively. Conclusions: This report demonstrates that the total number of paediatric medicines approved by EMEA is stable over the 10 -year period, while an increase in drugs to treat serious or orphan diseases has been observed. In addition, under the Centralised Procedure, a valuable number of paediatric trials have been submitted to support drug approval. © 2006 Springer-Verlag. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the prevalence, determinants and spectrum of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication and its associations with socioeconomic status (SES), health-related behaviour and living conditions. Design: Observational cross-sectional study. Setting: Germany. Participants: Representative population-based sample of non-institutionalised youth aged between 0 and 17  years (n= 17   450) and examined between 2003 and 2006. Main outcome measure: Prevalence and spectrum of ADHD medication (<b>Anatomical</b> <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>Chemical</b> (ATC) <b>code</b> N 04 BA) measured by standardised computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI) on drug use. Results: The overall prevalence of ADHD medication (stimulants including atomoxetine) was 0. 9 % (95 % CI 0. 7 % to 1. 1 %). Boys used these drugs (1. 5 %, 1. 2 % to 1. 8 %) {{five times more}} than girls 0. 3 % (0. 2 % to 0. 5 %). The highest prevalence rates were for boys aged 6 – 10  years (2. 3 %, 1. 7 % to 3. 1 %S) and 11 – 13 (2. 7 %, 2. 0 % to 3. 7 %). Boys from families with no immigration background used ADHD medication almost 6 times as frequently as boys with an immigration background (1. 7 % vs 0. 3 %). Multivariate analysis (binary logistic regression) showed boys (OR 5. 16, 95 % CI 3. 15 to 8. 47), 11 -year-olds to 13 -year-olds (2. 24, 1. 28 to 3. 49), children in large cities (2. 18, 1. 13 to 4. 22), children with no immigration background (3. 06, 1. 34 to 6. 99), and children with only a good (vs excellent) parent-rated health status (1. 91, 1. 18 to 3. 08) being {{more likely to be}} using ADHD medication. A visit to the doctor in the last month or last quarter was associated with a higher probability for ADHD medication (3. 18, 1. 29 to 7. 95 and 3. 59, 1. 45 to 8. 90, respectively). Conclusions: Results show prevalence rates of ADHD medication use for the German child and adolescent population that are considerably lower than published prevalence rates from the USA, but comparable with those of western European and Scandinavian countries. Lower use rates in rural versus urban regions may point to differential healthcare access. The inverse association of ADHD medication use with immigration status suggests potentially restricted access to healthcare services for immigrants or may reflect culture-specific differences in attitudes towards symptoms of ADHD...|$|R
40|$|Polypharmacy, and {{specifically}} {{the use of}} multiple fall-risk-increasing drugs (FRID), have been associated with increased risk of falling in older age. However, it is not yet clear whether the known set of FRIDs can be extrapolated to recurrent fallers, since they form a distinct group of more vulnerable older persons with different characteristics. We aim to investigate which classes of medications are associated with recurrent falls in elderly patients visiting the Emergency Department (ED) after a fall. This study had a cross-sectional design and was conducted in the ED of an academic medical center. Patients who sustained a fall, 65 years or older, and who visited the ED between 2004 and 2010 were invited to fill in a validated fall questionnaire designed to assess patient and fall characteristics (CAREFALL Triage Instrument [CTI]). We translated self-reported medications to <b>anatomical</b> <b>therapeutic</b> <b>chemical</b> (ATC) <b>codes</b> (at the second level). Univariate logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the association between medication classes and the outcome parameter (recurrent fall). Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the associations after adjustment to potential confounders. In total 2, 258 patients participated in our study, of whom 39 % (873) had sustained two or more falls within the previous year. After adjustment for the potential confounders, drugs for acid-related disorders (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1. 29; 95 % CI 1. 03 – 1. 60), analgesics (aOR 1. 22; 95 % CI 1. 06 – 1. 41), anti-Parkinson drugs (aOR 1. 59; 95 % CI 1. 02 – 2. 46), nasal preparations (aOR 1. 49; 95 % CI 1. 07 – 2. 08), ophthalmologicals (aOR 1. 51; 95 % CI 1. 10 – 2. 09); antipsychotics (aOR 2. 21; 95 % CI 1. 08 – 4. 52), and antidepressants (aOR 1. 64; 95 % CI 1. 13 – 2. 37) remained statistically significantly associated with an ED visit due to a recurrent fall. Known FRIDs, such as psychotropic drugs, also increase the risk of recurrent falls. However, we found four relatively new classes that showed significant association with recurrent falls. In part, these classes may act as markers of frailty and comorbidity, or they may reflect differences in the risk factors affecting the older, frailer population that tends to sustain recurrent falls.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Ranibizumab, a {{vascular}} endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) inhibitor, {{is used in}} the treatment of age-related macular degeneration. Inhibition of VEGF has an anti-angiogenic action and is associated with thrombogenicity, thus, myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke are potential side effects of VEGF inhibitors. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess the association between use of ranibizumab and risk of hospitalisation for ischaemic stroke (IS) and myocardial infarction (MI). METHODS: The self-controlled case series design was used, including subjects exposed to ranibizumab (<b>Anatomical</b> <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>Chemical</b> [ATC] <b>code</b> S 01 LA 04) who were hospitalized for IS (International Classification of Diseases, tenth edition [ICD- 10] code I 63) or the combined endpoint of stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) (ICD- 10 code G 45) or MI (ICD- 10 code I 21) were identified between August 2007 and March 2013. Rate ratios in exposed periods compared with unexposed periods were calculated using conditional Poisson regression. RESULTS: A total of 323 subjects received ranibizumab and were hospitalized for IS, 490 for IS or TIA, and 391 for MI. Median period of exposure was 8 - 9 months with follow-up times of approximately 2. 8 years. No elevated risk of IS was seen in the 1 - 30 days post initiation (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1. 36; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 98 - 1. 88); however, elevated risk was observed for those who received therapy for 31 - 60 days (IRR 1. 91; 95 % CI 1. 13 - 3. 24). Sensitivity analyses adjusting for time-varying confounders found elevated risk in both the 1 - 30 days and 31 - 60 days periods. Similar results to those for IS were observed for the combined endpoint of IS or TIA. No association was seen for MI in either time period (1 - 30 days IRR 0. 90, 95 % CI 0. 65 - 1. 23; 31 - 60 days IRR 0. 98, 95 % CI 0. 54 - 1. 79). CONCLUSION: This case-series analysis suggests an increased risk of hospitalisation for ischaemic stroke for patients receiving ranibizumab in the 31 - 60 days risk period. Studies with larger populations are required to confirm the risk in the 1 - 30 days risk period. No evidence of increased risk of hospitalisation for MI was observed. Nicole L. Pratt, Emmae N.
