40|$|Insulin {{triggers}} {{an extensive}} signaling cascade to coordinate adipocyte glucose metabolism. It is considered {{that the major}} role of insulin is to provide anabolic substrates by activating GLUT 4 -dependent glucose uptake. However, insulin stimulates phosphorylation of many metabolic proteins. To examine {{the implications of this}} on glucose metabolism, we performed dynamic tracer metabolomics in cultured adipocytes treated with insulin. Temporal analysis of metabolite concentrations and tracer labeling revealed rapid and distinct changes in glucose metabolism, favoring specific glycolytic branch points and pyruvate anaplerosis. Integrating dynamic metabolomics and phosphoproteomics data revealed that insulin-dependent phosphorylation of <b>anabolic</b> <b>enzymes</b> occurred prior to substrate accumulation. Indeed, glycogen synthesis was activated independently of glucose supply. We refer to this phenomenon as metabolic priming, whereby insulin signaling creates a demand-driven system to “pull” glucose into specific anabolic pathways. This complements the supply-driven regulation of anabolism by substrate accumulation and highlights an additional role for insulin action in adipocyte glucose metabolism...|$|R

We demonstrated that preoptic TH and estradiol receptor mRNA levels are greatly decreased by gonadectomy during vitellogenesis. For TH expression, this effect was reversed in part by estradiol supplementation. We have also confirmed the existence of an inhibitory gonadal feedback on FSH secretion, mediated by estradiol.

40|$|When {{threatened}} by pathogenic organisms or neoplastic disease, the mammalian host responds with a complex repertoire of metabolic alterations (1 - 3). During acute infection, accelerated protein and lipid catabolism are often observed, as are fever, hypoglycemia, and shock.

The immunological cross-reactivity observed only between the catabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferases and the <b>anabolic</b> <b>enzymes</b> of enterobacteria suggests that these proteins share some structural similarities. Indeed, the amino acid composition of the anabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase of E. coli K- 12 (argF and argI products) closely resembles the amino acid compositions of the catabolic enzymes of Pseudomonas putida, Aeromonas formicans, Streptococcus faecalis, and Bacillus licheniformis.

40|$|Pigeonpea is a {{tropical}} grain-legume, which is highly dehydration tolerant. The effect of drought {{stress on the}} carbohydrate metabolism in mature pigeonpea leaves was investigated by withholding water from plants grown in very large pots (50 kg of soil). The most striking feature of drought-stressed plants was the pronounced accumulation of D-pinitol (1 D- 3 -methyl-chiro-inositol), which increased from 14 to 85 mg g− 1 dry weight during a 27 d stress period. Concomitantly, the levels of starch, sucrose and the pinitol precursors myo-inositol and ononitol all decreased rapidly to zero or near-zero in response to drought. The levels of glucose and fructose increased moderately. Drought stress induced a pronounced increase of the activities of enzymes hydrolysing soluble starch (amylases) and sucrose (invertase and sucrose synthase). The two <b>anabolic</b> <b>enzymes</b> sucrose phosphate synthase (sucrose synthetic pathway) and myo-inositol methyl transferase (pinitol synthetic pathway) also showed an increase of activity during stress.

40|$|SummaryInfections disturb {{metabolic}} homeostasis in many contexts, but {{the underlying}} connections {{are not completely}} understood. To address this, we use paired genetic and computational screens in Drosophila to identify transcriptional regulators of immunity and pathology and their associated target genes and physiologies. We show that Mef 2 is required in the fat body for anabolic function and the immune response. Using genetic and biochemical approaches, we find that MEF 2 is phosphorylated at a conserved site in healthy flies and promotes expression of lipogenic and glycogenic enzymes. Upon infection, this phosphorylation is lost, and the activity of MEF 2 changes—MEF 2 now associates with the TATA binding protein to bind a distinct TATA box sequence and promote antimicrobial peptide expression. The loss of phosphorylated MEF 2 contributes to loss of <b>anabolic</b> <b>enzyme</b> expression in Gram-negative bacterial infection.

The deoxyribose moiety of deoxyinosine can be used to salvage thymine to thymine nucleotides, again in the presence of excess inorganic phosphate. Our results introduce a novel aspect of the salvage pathway, in which ribose phosphate seems to play a pivotal role. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

Antisera were prepared against the anabolic and catabolic OTCases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aeromonas formicans as well as against OTCase and putrescine carbamoyltransferases from Streptococcus faecalis; these antisera were then tested against the unpurified OTCases, either anabolic or catabolic, of 34 bacterial strains. Extensive cross-reactions were observed between the antisera to catabolic OTCases from P. aeruginosa, A. formicans and S. faecalis and the catabolic enzymes from other species or genera. These antisera cross-reacted also with the anabolic OTCases of strains of the Enterobacteriaceae but not with the anabolic OTCases of the same species or of other species or genera. The cross-reaction measured between the antisera against P. aeruginosa anabolic OTCase and the anabolic OTCases of other Pseudomonas were largely in agreement with the phylogenic subdivision of Pseudomonas proposed by N.

Our aim was to investigate whether gene expression of FAS, as well as its enzymatic activity, is regulated by HT and OL in two human colon cancer cell lines, as HT- 29 and SW 620. In addition, we investigated the effects of these polyphenols on growth and apoptosis in these cells. FAS gene expression and activity in treated HT- 29 and SW 620 cells were evaluated by real-time PCR and radiochemical assay, respectively. Cell growth and apoptosis, after polyphenols treatment, were measured by MTT test and flow cytometry, respectively. The inhibition of proliferation, detected after HT treatment, was mediated by an inhibition of FAS expression and its enzymatic activity in SW 620 cells, while the anti-proliferative effect in HT- 29 cells seems to be independent from FAS. OL exerted an anti-proliferative effect only on SW 620 cells with a mechanism which excluded FAS. Olive oil polyphenols used were able to induce apoptosis in both cell lines studied. The increase of apoptosis in these cells was accompanied by the block of cell cycle in the S phase.

The key species on the Arctic shelf, the calanoid copepod Calanus glacialis, grows and accumulates lipid reserves in spring and summer in surface waters. The winter is spent in dormancy in deeper water layers with low metabolic activity. As timing and intensity of metabolic changes have been poorly investigated, our study aims to characterize the physiology of C. glacialis over an entire year, from July 2012 to July 2013. We followed anabolic and catabolic enzyme activities and the biochemical composition of this species, taking depth-stratified samples once a month in Billefjorden, a high-Arctic sill fjord. A large part of the population had migrated to depths > 100 m by July 2012. Only thereafter, anabolic activities decreased slowly, suggesting that low metabolism is related to ceased feeding rather than to endogenous regulation. During overwintering, <b>anabolic</b> <b>enzyme</b> activities were reduced by half as compared to peak activities in spring. The biochemical composition of the copepods changed little from July to December. Then, the lipid catabolic activity increased and the lipid content decreased, likely fuelling moulting and gonad maturation. The protein content did not change significantly during winter, suggesting that proteins are not much catabolized during that time.

40|$|One of the {{biochemical}} derangements {{that frequently}} is noted in infected mammals is {{a decrease in}} the ability of insulin to promote glucose uptake and to stimulate anabolic processes (1, 2).

40|$|Amino acids are the {{precursors}} for {{the synthesis of}} proteins. In humans, {{approximately half of the}} 20 different amino acids are essential, ie, must be obtained from the diet. Cells must therefore take account of amino acid availability to achieve sustainable rates of protein synthesis. One of the major mechanisms involved in this is signaling through a complex of proteins termed mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTORC) 1, which is activated by amino acids. In turn, mTORC 1 regulates the production of ribosomes, the molecular machines that make proteins, and the activity of other cellular components required for protein synthesis. mTORC 1 signaling promotes the transcription of the genes for ribosomal RNAs and many other components involved in ribosome production. It also positively regulates the translation of the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for ribosomal proteins. Indeed, recent studies have shown that mammalian target of rapamycin signaling drives the translation of mRNAs for many <b>anabolic</b> <b>enzymes</b> and other proteins involved in diverse cellular functions. The translational machinery is also regulated by the absence of amino acids through the protein kinase GCN 2 (general control nonrepressed 2), which phosphorylates and in end-effect inhibits the translation initiation factor eIF 2 (eukaryotic initiation factor 2).

In the presence of Zn 2 +, however, the saturation curve of L-ornithine becomes sigmoidal, revealing positive cooperativity for this <b>anabolic</b> <b>enzyme.</b> The kinetic data give a limiting Hill coefficient of 2. 7 for this substrate at 0. 3 mM Zn 2 +. The allosteric effect of Zn 2 + on the enzyme is not altered by the concentration of carbamoyl phosphate, and the saturation curve of carbamoyl phosphate remains hyperbolic {{in the presence of}} the metal ion. At fixed substrate concentrations, initial velocity data obtained at 0. - 0. 3 mM Zn 2 + indicate cooperative binding of the metal ion to ornithine transcarbamoylase; a Hill coefficient of 1. 7 +/- 0. 1 is found that is independent of the level of L-ornithine.

Neither Co 2 + nor Cu 2 + exerts an effect on the kinetic behavior of the enzyme.

The pathway for the biosynthesis of the opine agropine is thought to require an enzyme, mannopine cyclase, coded for by the ags gene located in the T(R) region of octopine-type Ti plasmids. Extracts prepared from agropine-type tumors contained an activity that cyclized mannopine to agropine. Tumor cells containing a T region in which ags was mutated lacked this activity and did not contain agropine. Expression of ags from the lac promoter conferred mannopine-lactonizing activity on Escherichia coli. Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains harboring an octopine-type Ti plasmid exhibit a similar activity which is not coded for by ags. Analysis of the DNA sequence of the gene encoding this activity, called agcA, showed it to be about 60 % identical to T-DNA ags genes. Relatedness decreased abruptly in the 5 ' and 3 ' untranslated regions of the genes. ags is preceded by a promoter that functions only in the plant. Expression analysis showed that agcA also is preceded by its own promoter, which is active in the bacterium.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the hepatic manifestation of these disorders, increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, mechanisms linking hyperinsulinemia to NAFLD and HCC require clarification. We describe a novel model of primary insulin resistance and HCC with strong parent-of-origin effects. Male AB 6 F 1 (A/JCr dam × C 57 BL/ 6 sire) but not B 6 AF 1 (B 6 dam × A/J sire) mice developed spontaneous insulin resistance, NAFLD, and HCC without obesity or diabetes. A survey of mitochondrial, imprinted, and sex-linked traits revealed modest associations with X-linked genes. However, a diet-induced obesity study, including B 6. A chromosome substitution–strain (consomic) mice, showed no segregation by sex chromosome. Thus, parent-of-origin effects were specified within the autosomal genome. Next, we interrogated mechanisms of insulin-associated hepatocarcinogenesis. Steatotic hepatocytes exhibited adipogenic transition characterized by vacuolar metaplasia and up-regulation of vimentin, adipsin, fatty acid translocase (CD 36), peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-γ, and related products. This profile was largely recapitulated in insulin-supplemented primary mouse hepatocyte cultures. Importantly, pyruvate kinase M 2, a fetal <b>anabolic</b> <b>enzyme</b> implicated in the Warburg effect, was activated by insulin in vivo and in vitro. Thus, our study reveals parent-of-origin effects in heritable insulin resistance, implicating adipogenic transition with acquired anabolic metabolism in the progression from NAFLD to HCC.

DNA sequence analysis of the inactivated locus confirmed that the transposon had inserted into a locus whose product demonstrated significant primary sequence homology {{to members of the}} AraC family of transcriptional activators. DNA mobility shift assays affirmed this potential regulatory function and indicated that the inactivated gene encodes a transcriptional regulator, which has been designated OruR. In trying to define the ornithine utilization phenotype further, a similar inactivation was engineered in the wild-type strain, PAO 1. The resulting isolate (PAO 1 R 4) was totally unable to use ornithine as the sole carbon source. Despite the intensified phenotype, this isolate failed to demonstrate significant changes in any of the catabolic or <b>anabolic</b> <b>enzymes</b> that are known to be subject to regulation by the presence of either ornithine or arginine. It did, however, show modified levels of an enzyme, ornithine acetyltransferase (OAcT), that was previously thought to have merely an anaplerotic activity. Definition of this oruR locus and its effects upon OAcT activity provide evidence that control of ornithine levels in P. aeruginosa may have a significant impact upon how the cell is able to monitor and regulate the use of arginine and glutamate as sources of either carbon or nitrogen...|$|R
40|$|The Pyrococcus furiosus {{ornithine}} carbamoyltransferase (OTCase) {{is extremely}} heat stable and maintains 50 % of its catalytic activity after 60 min at 100 °C. The enzyme has an unusual quaternary structure {{when compared to}} anabolic OTCases from mesophilic organisms. It is built up of four trimers arranged in a tetrahedral manner, while other <b>anabolic</b> <b>enzymes</b> are single trimers. Residues Trp 21, Glu 25, Met 29 and Trp 33 {{are located in the}} main interfaces that occur between the catalytic trimers within the dodecamer. They participate in either hydrophobic clusters or ionic interactions. In order to elucidate the role played by the oligomerization in the enzyme stability at very high temperatures, we performed mutagenesis studies of these residues. All the variants show similar catalytic activities and kinetic properties when compared to the wild-type enzyme, allowing the interpretation of the mutations solely on heat stability and quaternary structure. The W 21 A variant has only a slight decrease in its stability, and is a dodecamer. The variants E 25 Q, M 29 A, W 33 A, W 21 A/W 33 A and E 25 Q/W 33 A show that altering more drastically the interfaces results in a proportional decrease in heat stability, correlated with a gradual dissociation of dodecamers into trimers. Finally, the E 25 Q/M 29 A/W 33 A variant shows a very large decrease in heat stability and is a trimer. These results suggest that extreme thermal stabilization of this OTCase is achieved in part through oligomerization. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} of the catabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase of Pseudomonas fluorescens are compared {{to those of the}} anabolic transferase of the same organism. The comparison is also extended to a mutationally modified enzyme which, in contrast to the catabolic enzyme, is able to synthesize citrulline in vivo. All three activities are measured in the direction of citrulline synthesis. The catabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase and the mutationally modified enzyme have an approximate molecular weight of 400000 while that of the <b>anabolic</b> <b>enzyme</b> is 100000. The catabolic transferase exhibits a number of regulatory properties which are not observed with the anabolic enzyme: Its saturation by carbamyolphosphate is intensively cooperative. Its half saturation concentration is more than one hundred times higher than the Km of the anabolic enzymes; this explains its inability to perform an anabolic function in vivo. Phosphate, a substrate in the physiological direction of the reaction and a low‐energy‐level indicator, acts as an activator of the enzyme; it abolishes the cooperativity of the carbamoylphosphate and increases the capacity of the enzymes. ATP, a product of the catabolic pathway and a high‐energy‐level signal, reduces the capacity of the enzyme. Putrescine, another product of the catabolic pathway, and its analogs, inhibit the enzyme by decreasing its apparent affinity for carbamoylphosphate. The catabolic transferase of the mutant IRC 204 M 1 shares all those properties with the wild‐type enzyme, but, owing to a reduced cooperativity of carbamoylphosphate, it is able to perform an anabolic function at reduced rate. Thus, the comparison of the regulatory {{properties of}} the catabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase and of the modified enzyme provides a kinetic explanation for the inability of the catabolic enzyme to play an anabolic role and this without the need of referring to compartmentation of channeling of the anabolic and catabolic pathways.

40|$|Methylotrophic organisms {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the field of Biotechnology applications. This is due, partly, to their unique metabolic pathways in the Nature, but also because of their capacity and diversity to assimilate or oxidise low-cost substrates (raw-materials or industrial pollutants). In bioremediation and biological degradation of effluents, the use of methylotrophic organisms have been recently described, forecasting new trends in the near future. A previously isolated facultative methylotrophic bacterium, Methylobacterium sp. RXM was biochemically characterized through the study of methanol dissimulation and assimilation metabolism, and physiologically characterized through the study of the bacterium metabolic responses upon different environmental conditions (dilution rate, ph limiting nutrient, addition or removal of metallic ions, etc). For methanol-limited chemostat, the assimilated carbon flux was exclusively channelled to biomass synthesis and CO_ 2 production. A maximal carbon conversion efficiency of 58 % was reached and a maximal catabolism / anabolism coupling was observed. At the enzymatic level, methanol-oxidising activities decreased as dilution rate (D) was increased. Conversely, assimilatory enzymes increased their activity with D. A partial catabolism / anabolism dissociation was obtained both in Methylobacterium sp. RXM steady-state carbon-excess chemostat conditions and for methanol-limited chemostat cultures after the addition of a methanol pulse (transient state). When magnesium or ammonium were the limiting nutrient, the assimilated carbon excess leaded to higher substrate consumption rates (methanol and oxygen), low biomass yields and excretion of intermediary metabolites (lactate, formate and polysaccharides). The VIP group ions (tungstate or molybdate) addition to the culture medium, affected the catabolic carbon flux (both in batch and continuous cultivation). The anabolic flux remained unchanged as assessed by the measurements of the <b>anabolic</b> <b>enzyme</b> activities. Crude extracts enzyme assays revealed that the presence of transition metals in the culture medium exerted influence in only one methanol oxidative enzyme [...] Available from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|International audienceSponges (phylum Porifera) {{had been}} {{considered}} as an enigmatic phylum, prior {{to the analysis of}} their genetic repertoire/tool kit. Already with the isolation of the first adhesion molecule, galectin, {{it became clear that the}} sequences of sponge cell surface receptors and of molecules forming the intracellular signal transduction pathways triggered by them, share high similarity with those identified in other metazoan phyla. These studies demonstrated that all metazoan phyla, including Porifera, originate from one common ancestor, the Urmetazoa. The sponges evolved prior to the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary (542 million years ago [myr]) during two major "snowball earth events", the Sturtian glaciation (710 to 680 myr) and the Varanger-Marinoan ice ages (605 to 585 myr). During this period the ocean was richer in silica due to the silicate weathering. The oldest sponge fossils (Hexactinellida) have been described from Australia, China and Mongolia and are thought to have existed coeval with the diverse Ediacara fauna. Only little younger are the fossils discovered in the Sansha section in Hunan (Early Cambrian; China). It has been proposed that only the sponges possessed the genetic repertoire to cope with the adverse conditions, e. g. temperature-protection molecules or proteins protecting them against ultraviolet radiation. The skeletal elements of the Hexactinellida (model organisms Monorhaphis chuni and Monorhaphis intermedia or Hyalonema sieboldi) and Demospongiae (models Suberites domuncula and Geodia cydonium), the spicules, are formed enzymatically by the <b>anabolic</b> <b>enzyme</b> silicatein and the catabolic enzyme silicase. Both, the spicules of Hexactinellida and of Demospongiae, comprise a central axial canal and an axial filament which harbors the silicatein. After intracellular formation of the first lamella around the channel and the subsequent extracellular apposition of further lamellae the spicules are completed in a net formed of collagen fibers. The data summarized here substantiate that with the finding of silicatein a new aera in the field of bio/inorganic chemistry started. For the first time strategies could be formulated and experimentally proven that allow the formation/synthesis of inorganic structures by organic molecules. These findings are not only of importance for the further understanding of basic pathways in the body plan formation of sponges but also of eminent importance for applied/commercial processes in a sustainable use of biomolecules for novel bio/inorganic materials...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectivesTo {{identify}} {{changes in}} the expression patterns of enzymes involved in chondroitin sulfate (CS) glycosaminoglycan (GAG) metabolism in articular cartilage proteoglycan (PG) isolated from adolescent patients with Kashin–Beck disease (KBD). MethodsSamples of articular cartilage {{were divided into two}} groups: Control samples (from five normal children), and KBD samples (from five KBD children) aged 3 – 12 years old. The morphology and pathology of hand joint cartilage were examined by histochemical staining. The localization and expression patterns of enzymes involved in CS GAG metabolism (i. e., PAPS synthetase 2 (PAPSS 2), PAPS transporter 1 (PAPST 1), Carbohydrate (N-acetylgalactosamine 4 -sulfate 6 -O) sulfotransferases 15 (CHST 15), Arylsulfatase B (ARSB) and N-acetylgalactosamine- 6 -sulfate sulfatase (GALNS)) were performed using immuno-histochemical analyses. Positive immunostaining in articular cartilage was semi-quantified. ResultsReduced aggrecan staining was observed in KBD samples compared with the control samples. The percentages of positive staining for the <b>anabolic</b> <b>enzymes</b> PAPSS 2, PAPST 1 and CHST 15 in the upper and middle zones of KBD samples were significantly lower than that found in the Controls. In contrast, the percentages of positive staining in KBD samples for the catabolic enzymes ARSB and GALNS were significantly higher than the control samples. However, the staining for all of these GAG metabolism enzymes were hardly observed in the deep zones of KBD cartilage, suggesting that significant cell death and necrosis had occurred in this region. ConclusionsOur results indicate that alterations of enzymes involved in articular cartilage CS GAG metabolism on PGs in the articular cartilage {{play an important role in}} the onset and pathogenesis of KBD in adolescent children...|$|R
40|$|Transformed {{cells are}} {{characterized}} by imbalances in metabolic routes. In particular, different key enzymes of nucleotide metabolism and DNA biosynthesis, such as CTP synthetase, thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate reductase, IMP dehydrogenase, ribonucleotide reductase, DNA polymerase, and DNA methyltransferase, are markedly up-regulated in certain tumor cells. Together with the concomitant down-modulation of the purine and pyrimidine degradation <b>enzymes,</b> the increased <b>anabolic</b> propensity supports the excessive proliferation of transformed cells. However, many types of cancer cells have maintained the ability to differentiate terminally into mature, non-proliferating cells not only in response to physiological receptor ligands, such as retinoic acid, vitamin D metabolites, and cytokines, but also following exposure {{to a wide variety}} of non-physiological agents such as antimetabolites. Interestingly, induction of tumor cell differentiation is often associated with reversal of the transformation-related enzyme deregulations. An important class of differentiating compounds comprises the antimetabolites of purine and pyrimidine nucleotide metabolism and nucleic acid synthesis, the majority being structural analogs of natural nucleosides. The CTP synthetase inhibitors cyclopentenylcytosine and 3 -deazauridine, the thymidylate synthase inhibitor 5 -fluoro- 2 '-deoxyuridine, the dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor methotrexate, the IMP dehydrogenase inhibitors tiazofurin, ribavirin, 5 -ethynyl- 1 -beta-D-ribofuranosylimidazole- 4 -carboxamide (EICAR) and mycophenolic acid, the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors hydroxyurea and deferoxamine, and the DNA polymerase inhibitors ara-C, 9 -(2 -phosphonylmethoxyethyl) adenine (PMEA), and aphidicolin, as well as several nucleoside analogs perturbing the DNA methylation pattern, have been found to induce tumor cell differentiation through impairment of DNA synthesis and/or function. Thus, by selectively targeting those <b>anabolic</b> <b>enzymes</b> that contribute to the neoplastic behavior of cancer cells, the normal cellular differentiation program may be reactivated and the malignant phenotype suppressed. status: publishe...|$|R

The {{molecular weight}} of the purified enzyme was 125, 000, and it contained only one type of subunit (M(r) = 58, 000). The amino-terminal sequence had 46 to 57 % similarity {{to those of the}} large subunits of the eubacterial <b>anabolic</b> <b>enzymes</b> and 37 to 43 % similarity to those of the yeast and plant enzymes. The methanococcal enzyme had a pH optimum of 7. 6. The pI, estimated by chromatofocusing, was 5. 6. Activity required Mg 2 + or Mn 2 + ions, thiamine pyrophosphate, and a flavin. Flavin adenine dinucleotide, flavin mononucleotide, and riboflavin plus 10 mM phosphate all supported activity. However, activity was strongly inhibited by these flavins at 0. 3 mM. The Michaelis constants for pyruvate, MgCl 2, MnCl 2, thiamine pyrophosphate, flavin adenine dinucleotide, and flavin mononucleotide were 6. 8 mM, 0. 3 mM, 0. 16 mM, 1. 6 microM, 0. 4 microM, and 1. 3 microM, respectively. In cell extracts, the enzyme was sensitive to O 2 (half-life = 2. 7 min with 5 % O 2 in the headspace), but the purified enzyme was less sensitive to O 2 (half-life = 78. 0 min with 20 % O 2). Reconstitution of the enzyme with flavin adenine dinucleotide increased the sensitivity to O 2. Moreover, in the assay the homogeneous enzyme was rapidly inactivated by O 2, and the concentration required for 50 % inhibition (I 50) was obtained with an atmosphere of 0. 11 % O 2. The methanococcal enzyme has similarities to the eubacterial and eucaryotic enzymes, consistent with the ancient origin of the archaebacterial enzyme...|$|R
