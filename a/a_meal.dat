5|$|Gastroparesis {{is another}} common misdiagnosis. Like {{rumination}} syndrome, patients with gastroparesis often bring up food following the ingestion of <b>a</b> <b>meal.</b> Unlike rumination, gastroparesis causes vomiting (in contrast to regurgitation) of food, {{which is not}} being digested further, from the stomach. This vomiting occurs several hours after <b>a</b> <b>meal</b> is ingested, preceded by nausea and retching, and has the bitter or sour taste typical of vomit.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess whether}} <b>a</b> late evening <b>meal</b> would improve {{nitrogen}} balance {{in patients with}} cirrhosis of the liver. DESIGN [...] Randomised crossover study of meal schedules comparing three <b>meals</b> <b>a</b> day with four or six <b>meals</b> <b>a</b> day, the four and six meal schedules both including <b>a</b> late evening <b>meal</b> (2300). SETTING [...] Metabolic ward. PATIENTS [...] Seven men and two women aged 34 - 66 with cirrhosis of the liver (Child's grade B). INTERVENTIONS [...] Patients spent two seven day periods in the ward. For five days of each period they received, in random order, isonitrogenous isocaloric diets supplied in three <b>meals</b> <b>a</b> day and in four or six <b>meals</b> <b>a</b> day. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Nitrogen balance, calculated as the difference between dietary intake and the total of urinary, faecal, and integumental nitrogen loss. RESULTS [...] Faecal nitrogen loss was no different between three <b>meals</b> <b>a</b> day and four or six <b>meals</b> <b>a</b> day. On both four and six <b>meals</b> <b>a</b> day, however, patients had nitrogen balances that were more positive (or less negative) than on three <b>meals</b> <b>a</b> day (1. 26 (SD 2. 1) g/ 24 h v 0. 26 (2. 2) g/ 24 h, p less than 0. 01). Six <b>meals</b> <b>a</b> day did not produce significantly better improvements in nitrogen balance than four <b>meals</b> <b>a</b> day. CONCLUSIONS [...] <b>A</b> late evening <b>meal</b> seemed to improve the efficiency of nitrogen metabolism, but longer term {{studies are needed to}} assess whether this leads to a better nutritional state...|$|R

5|$|The thin {{skin of the}} octopus absorbs {{additional}} oxygen. When resting, around 41% of an octopus's oxygen absorption {{is through}} the skin.

5|$|While {{the number}} and {{severity}} of symptoms varies among individuals, repetitive regurgitation of undigested food (known as rumination) {{after the start of}} <b>a</b> <b>meal</b> is always present.

40|$|Background: Conventional 13 C-urea breath testing (13 C-UBT) {{includes}} <b>a</b> test <b>meal</b> {{to delay}} gastric emptying, which, theoretically, improves {{the accuracy of}} the test. Citric acid has been proposed as the best test meal. However, recent studies have suggested that <b>a</b> test <b>meal</b> may not be necessary. Aim: To investigate a new 13 C-UBT protocol without <b>a</b> test <b>meal</b> in <b>a</b> Chinese population. Methods: Consecutive dyspeptic patients referred for upper endoscopy were recruited. 13 C-UBT was performed on two separate days with or without <b>a</b> test <b>meal</b> (2. 4 Gm citric acid) and compared with the 'gold standard' (CLO test and histology). Results: Two hundred and two patients were tested. Using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis, the optimal delta-value and optimal measurement interval for UBT were 5 % and 30 min, respectively, both with or without <b>a</b> test <b>meal.</b> The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of 13 C-UBT with citric acid (96. 5 %, 97. 7 %, 98. 2 %, 95. 6 %, 97. 0 %) were similar to 13 C-UBT without <b>a</b> test <b>meal</b> (94. 7 %, 97. 7 %, 98. 2 %, 93. 5 %, 96. 0 %). Conclusion: This simplified 13 C-UBT protocol without <b>a</b> test <b>meal</b> produced highly accurate and reliable results in the Chinese population. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
