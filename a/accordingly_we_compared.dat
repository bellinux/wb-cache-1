Our system has to provide responsive information about user activities throughout the day, so different inference engines are tested.

Using this database, evidences are built to query a logic network about current activities. Markov Logic Networks are able to deal with uncertainty while keeping a structured knowledge. This makes them a suitable tool for ambient sensors based inference. However, in their previous application, inferences are usually made offline.

Method: Eight drug-free patients with narcolepsy with severe cataplexy and 8 controls were studied. Fifty-four color pictures (pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant) selected from the International Affective Picture System were presented on a monitor to the subjects. The effects of exposure to the pictures were assessed in muscular (corrugator, zygomatic and mylohyoid electromyographic activity), autonomic (blood pressure, heart rate, and skin conductance responses) cognitive (scalp-recorded event-related potentials), and subjective (valence, arousal, and dominance by Self-Assessment Manikin) systems. Results: The autonomic, muscular, and cognitive systems showed an attenuated reaction to visual stimuli in patients compared to controls. Furthermore, patients with narcolepsy showed the lowest responses when unpleasant pictures were presented. Conclusions: Our data suggest that, compared to the group of healthy subjects, patients with narcolepsy suffer from a temporal disadvantage in input processing, in particular, of unpleasant stimuli.

This setup enables us to contribute to the theoretical debate on the duality of control and accountability. Specifically, by comparing job locations (home versus office), we identify conditions under which job control (worktime control) is more likely to act as an asset or as a liability. Results suggest that ability to concentrate is higher and need for recovery is lower, on home days than on office days. However, on home days, generally high level of worktime control amplifies the association between job demands and need for recoverywhereas this association is reversed when worktime control is generally moderate. No similar differences are observed on office days. Finally, whereas employees experiencing high job demands are more able to concentrate during home days than during office days, worktime control has no differential effect in this respect.

The patterns of effects across these two anagram types for the two groups of readers were very similar. In particular, both groups showed similarly slowed response times (and developing readers increased errors) for anagrams requiring only interior letter transpositions but not for anagrams that required exterior letter transpositions.

Mutations in protease sequences from 26, 888 individuals and in RT sequences from 25, 695 individuals were classified according to whether they were nonpolymorphic in untreated individuals and whether their prevalence increased fivefold with ARV therapy. This analysis showed that 88 PI-selected and 122 RTI-selected nonpolymorphic mutations had a prevalence that was fivefold higher in individuals receiving ARVs than in ARV-naïve individuals. This was an increase of 47 % and 77 %, respectively, compared with the 60 PI- and 69 RTI-selected mutations identified in a similar analysis that we published in 2005 using subtype B sequences obtained from one-fourth as many individuals.

We hypothesized in RB tissue that such differences are also indicators {{of whether or not}} they are sensitive to etoposide. <b>Accordingly,</b> <b>we</b> <b>compared</b> in malignant etoposide-sensitive and etoposide-resistant WERI-Rb 1 cells TRPV 1, TRPM 8 and TRPA 1 subtype and CB 1 gene expression pattern levels and accompanying functional activity using quantitative real-time RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence microscopy, calcium imaging as well as patch-clamp technology. Gene expression patterns were evaluated in enucleated human RB tissues (n = 4). Both etoposide-resistant and etoposide-sensitive WERI-Rb 1 cells expressed all of the aforementioned channels based on responses to known activators and thermal challenges. However, TRPA 1 was absent in the etoposide-resistant counterpart. Even though both types of RB cells express TRPV 1 as well as TRPM 8 and CB 1, the capsaicin (50 μM) (CAP) -induced Ca 2 + rise caused by TRPV 1 activation was prompt and transient only in etoposide-resistant RB cells (n = 8). In this cell type, the inability of CB 1 activation (10 μM WIN) to suppress Ca 2 + responses to CAP (50 μM; n = 4) may be attributable to the absence of TRPA 1 gene expression. Therefore, using genetic approaches to upregulate TRPA 1 expression could provide a means to induce etoposide sensitivity and suppress RB cell tumorigenesis...|$|E

Overall, the best-fitting model to the CDM halos is Einasto’s, although the Prugniel-Simien and Dehnen-McLaughlin models also perform well. With regard to the spherical-collapse halos, both the Prugniel-Simien and Einasto models describe the density profiles well, with an rms scatter some 4 times smaller than that obtained with either the NFW-like model or the three-parameter Dehnen-McLaughlin model.

However, within prefrontal cortex, the regional specificity for different control processes is still largely underspecified. Here we used fMRI to investigate the processes involved in part-list cueing, a phenomenon entailing the reduction of memory performance {{when some of the}} “to-be-remembered items” are presented during retrieval. Retrieval inhibition and strategy disruption have been proposed as possible underlying causes of this surprising effect. Critically, different encoding conditions can dissociate these two hypotheses, as this is thought to have a different impact on strategy-related versus inhibition-related processes. <b>Accordingly,</b> <b>we</b> <b>compared</b> part-list versus no part-list retrieval conditions, following high versus low associative encoding conditions. This revealed activation of the left frontopolar and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in conditions of part-list cueing retrieval, but only following low associative encoding. These results are consistent with the inhibitory or interference resolution accounts of part-list cueing, suggesting a critical role of between-items competition and high monitoring demands at retrieval. In addition, we also examined brain activation during the encoding phase, specifying further possible anatomo-functional links between encoding and retrieval processes. The results suggest that different encoding conditions induce distinct patterns of activation at retrieval, corroborating the idea that they promote the adoption of different retrieval strategies.

For this purpose, we collected a total of 42 tumor samples from 25 patients and analyzed their genomic profiles by array-based comparative genomic hybridization. We then compared the genetic profiles of metastatic primary tumors (MPTs) with their paired lymph node metastases (LNMs), and also those of LNMs with non-metastatic primary tumors (NMPTs). Firstly, we found that although there were some distinctive differences in the patterns of genomic profiles between MPTs and their paired LNMs, the paired samples shared similar genomic aberration patterns in each case. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis grouped together 12 of the 15 MPT-LNM pairs. Furthermore, similarity scores between paired samples {{were significantly higher than}} those between non-paired samples. These results suggested that MPTs and their paired LNMs are composed predominantly of genetically clonal tumor cells, while minor populations with different CNAs may also exist in metastatic OSCCs. Secondly, to identify CNAs related to lymph node metastasis, we compared CNAs between grouped samples of MPTs and LNMs, but were unable to find any CNAs that were more common in LNMs. Finally, we hypothesized that subpopulations carrying metastasis-related CNAs might be present in both the MPT and LNM. <b>Accordingly,</b> <b>we</b> <b>compared</b> CNAs between NMPTs and LNMs, and found that gains of 7 p, 8 q and 17 q were mor...|$|E

Breath by-breath analyses of expired air via a facemask was obtained using a portable, battery operated device. Oxygen consumption (VO 2), carbon dioxide production (VCO 2), tidal volume (VT), respiratory rate (RR), minute ventilation (VE), and inspiratory capacity (IC) were compared.

40|$|The photoisomerization of the retinal {{chromophore}} {{of visual}} pigments proceeds along a complex reaction coordinate on a multidimensional surface that comprises a hydrogen-out-of-plane (HOOP) coordinate, a bond length alternation (BLA) coordinate, a single bond torsion and, finally, the reactive double bond torsion. These {{degrees of freedom}} are coupled with changes in the electronic structure of the chromophore and, therefore, the computational investigation of the photochemistry of such systems {{requires the use of}} a methodology capable of describing electronic structure changes along all those coordinates. Here, we employ the penta- 2, 4 -dieniminium (PSB 3) cation as a minimal model of the retinal chromophore of visual pigments and compare its excited state isomerization paths at the CASSCF and CASPT 2 levels of theory. These paths connect the cis isomer and the trans isomer of PSB 3 with two structurally and energetically distinct conical intersections (CIs) that belong to the same intersection space. MRCISD+Q energy profiles along these paths provide benchmark values against which other ab initio methods are validated. <b>Accordingly,</b> <b>we</b> <b>compare</b> the energy profiles of MRPT 2 methods (CASPT 2, QD-NEVPT 2, and XMCQDPT 2) and EOM-SF-CC methods (EOM-SF-CCSD and EOM-SF-CCSD(dT)) to the MRCISD+Q reference profiles. We find that the paths produced with CASSCF and CASPT 2 are topologically and energetically different, partially due to the existence of a “locally excited” region on the CASPT 2 excited state near the Franck–Condon point that is absent in CASSCF and that involves a single bond, rather than double bond, torsion.

Phylogenetic trees generated from portions of the M and L segments yielded different topologies from S segment sequences as three clades became consolidated into two. Although direct evidence for genetic exchange by reassortment was lacking among cocirculating strains in Connecticut, molecular trees from S, M, and L segments were incongruent, which suggests a distinct evolutionary history or process for each genomic segment. These results suggest that JCV variants are stably maintained in Connecticut where they infect a wide diversity of mosquito species...|$|E
40|$|Background: There {{is little}} {{published}} research about differences in doctor-patient communication of different specialties. <b>Accordingly,</b> <b>we</b> <b>compared</b> doctor-patient communication skills {{in two different}} specialties, general surgery (GS) and general practice (GP). Methods: Twenty residents training at the Bahrain Defence Force Hospital (10 men and 10 women; mean age 28 years; 10 GS and 10 GP) participated in 200 patient first visit consultations. The consultations were video-recorded and analysed by four trained observers using the MAAS Global scale. Results: 1) Internal consistency reliability of the MAAS Global (> 0. 91) and Ep 2 = 0. 84 for raters was high, 2) GP residents spent more time (12 minutes) than GS residents (7 minutes), in the visits, 3) There were several differences on the MAAS Global items between GP and GS residents (GS > GP, p GS, p < 0. 05 on information giving), and 4) The present participants performed well compared to normative samples {{as well as to}} criterion-referenced cut-off scores. The general level of communication skills in both specialties, however, was ‘unsatisfactory’ and ‘doubtful’, as it is for normative samples. Conclusion: Excellent doctor-patient communication is essential but does not appear to receive the amount of attention that it deserves in practice settings. There are some differences between specialties as well as unsatisfactory communication skills for both specialties, since residents from both programs spent less time than recommended on each consultation. Our findings emphasize the need to improve the communication skills of physicians in general and for surgeons in particular...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Fatty acids are {{classified}} as short-chain (SCFA), medium-chain (MCFA) or long-chain and hold promise as adjunctive chemotherapeutic agents {{for the treatment of}} colorectal cancer. The antineoplastic potential of MCFA remains underexplored; <b>accordingly,</b> <b>we</b> <b>compared</b> the MCFA lauric acid (C 12 : 0) to the SCFA butyrate (C 4 : 0) in terms of their capacity to induce apoptosis, modify glutathione (GSH) levels, generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), and modify phases of the cell cycle in Caco- 2 and IEC- 6 intestinal cell lines. METHODS: Caco- 2 and IEC- 6 cells were treated with lauric acid, butyrate, or vehicle controls. Apoptosis, ROS, and cell cycle analysis were determined by flow cytometry. GSH availability was assessed by enzymology. RESULTS: Lauric acid induced apoptosis in Caco- 2 (p < 0. 05) and IEC- 6 cells (p < 0. 05) compared to butyrate. In Caco- 2 cells, lauric acid reduced GSH availability and generated ROS compared to butyrate (p < 0. 05). Lauric acid reduced Caco- 2 and IEC- 6 cells in G 0 /G 1 and arrested cells in the S and G 2 /M phases. Lauric acid induced apoptosis in IEC- 6 cells compared to butyrate (p < 0. 05). Butyrate protected IEC- 6 cells from ROS-induced damage, whereas lauric acid induced high levels of ROS compared to butyrate. CONCLUSION: Compared to butyrate, lauric acid displayed preferential antineoplastic properties, including induction of apoptosis in a CRC cell line. J. K. Fauser, G. M. Matthews, A. G. Cummins, G. S.

40|$|Data {{management}} {{is the very}} first issue in handling very large datasets. Many existing out-of-core algorithms used in visualization are closely coupled with application-specific logic. This paper presents two knowledgebased out-of-core prefetching algorithms that do not use hard-coded rendering-related logic. They acquire {{the knowledge of the}} access history and patterns dynamically, and adapt their prefetching strategies <b>accordingly.</b> <b>We</b> have <b>compared</b> the algorithms with a demand-based algorithm, as well as a more domain-specific out-of-core algorithm. We carried out our evaluation in conjunction with an example application where rendering multiple point sets in a volume scene graph put a great strain on the rendering algorithm in terms of memory management. Our results have shown that the knowledge-based approach offers a better cache-hit to disk-access trade-off. This work demonstrates {{that it is possible to}} build an out-of-core prefetching algorithm without depending on rendering-related application-specific logic. The knowledge based approach has the advantage of being generic, efficient, flexible and self-adaptive...|$|R
40|$|Background— Magnetic {{resonance}} myocardial perfusion imaging (MRMPI) has {{a number}} of advantages over the other noninvasive tests used to detect reversible myocardial ischemia. The majority of previous studies have generally used quantitative coronary angiography as the gold standard to assess the accuracy of MRMPI; however, only an approximate relationship exists between stenosis severity and functional significance. Pressure wire–derived fractional flow reserve (FFR) values &# 60; 0. 75 correlate closely with objective evidence of reversible ischemia. <b>Accordingly,</b> <b>we</b> have <b>compared</b> MRMPI with FFR. Methods and Results— One hundred three patients referred for investigation of suspected angina underwent MRMPI with a 1. 5 -T scanner. The stress agent was intravenous adenosine (140 µg · kg – 1 · min – 1), and the first-pass bolus contained 0. 1 mmol/kg gadolinium. In the following week, coronary angiography with pressure wire studies was performed. FFR was recorded in all patent major epicardial coronary arteries, with a value &# 60; 0. 75 denoting significant stenosis. MRMPI scans, analyzed by 2 blinded observers, identified perfusion defects in 121 of 300 coronary artery segments (40...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRecent {{research}} shows that random linear network coding is adapted to current network systems to provide transmission reliability. In lossy wireless networks, TCP traffic has to resist against losses by a suitable network coding scheme and redundancy control. Whenever TCP wants to transmit a packet, the original TCP/NC could send more than one coded packets which combine all non-ACKed packets remained in the TCP congestion window. Packet losses are essentially masked by TCP/NC from the congestion control algorithm. The original TCP/NC lacks an adaptive redundancy control to compensate errors in time. We present Dynamic Coding - DynCod, a new coding scheme, to address this problem. In DynCod, when TCP wants to transmit a packet, DynCod will code this packet with others non-ACKed in TCP congestion window. Therefore, the latest data is always transformed and presented by only one coded packet at a time. Thank to this progressive encoding of DynCod, any decoding failures at destination {{can be seen as}} a signal of loss. The source can be informed via TCP ACKs and adjust the number of redundant packets <b>accordingly.</b> <b>We</b> have <b>compared</b> the performances of DynCod and TCP/NC using NS- 2. The simulation results show that DynCod outperforms the original TCP/NC in terms of throughput and packet delivery time...|$|R
