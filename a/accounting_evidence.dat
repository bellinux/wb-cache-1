5000|$|The {{decision}} was important mainly for the court's determination in the damages {{phase of the}} trial that Paramount used [...] "unconscionable" [...] means of determining how much to pay authors, which is widely called [...] "Hollywood Accounting." [...] Paramount claimed, and provided <b>accounting</b> <b>evidence</b> to support the claim, that despite the movie's $288 million in revenues, it had earned no net profit, according {{to the definition of}} [...] "net profit" [...] in Buchwald's contract, and hence Buchwald was owed nothing. The court agreed with Buchwald's argument that this was [...] "unconscionable" [...] and therefore invalid. Fearing a loss if it appealed, and the subsequent implications of the unconscionability decision across all its other contracts, Paramount settled for $900,000.

By the 1830s, the choir's resourcing had been taken over by a list of voluntary subscribers. On arrival as Vicar of Leeds in 1837, Walter Farquhar Hook said he found [...] "the surplices in rags and the books in tatters". Additional to its extensive commitment in the provision of choral services, the choir is known to a wide public through many recitals, recordings and broadcasts and by its regular choir tours - the first tour was held in July 1968 and the 40th anniversary tour, from 22 to 27 July 2008, included singing in Ely Cathedral, King's College Cambridge, the National Musicians' Church St Sepulchre-without-Newgate in the City of London, All Saints Pastoral Centre London Colney and the Chapel of the Royal Hospital Chelsea.|$|E

40|$|The paper uses <b>accounting</b> <b>evidence</b> {{to explore}} {{when and how}} {{capitalism}} came to America. It continues the search for capitalists in American history begun in ‘Americanism and financial accounting theory. Part 1 : Was America Born Capitalist?’ Part 1 concluded that America was not ‘born capitalist’ in Marx's sense, and that the capitalist mentality had not appeared in farming even by the late 19 th century, on southern slave plantations by the Civil War, or in manufacturing enterprises by the 1830 s. This paper (Part 2) challenges Alfred Chandler's thesis that the ‘modern business enterprise’ brought ‘a new type of capitalism’ from around the mid- 19 th century. It re-examines <b>accounting</b> <b>evidence</b> from the Boston textile mills, the railroads, and the {{iron and steel industry}}. It concludes that the Boston Associates who historians often see as ‘proto-capitalists’, the ‘managerial capitalists’ Chandler sees on the railroads, and the ‘entrepreneurial capitalists’ he sees in the iron and steel industry and elsewhere, remained semi-capitalists because their capitals and workers were not ‘free’. The paper re-examines the ‘costing renaissance’, the introduction and spread of product costing, standard costing, ROI and flexible budgets, and the evidence in Chandler's and Johnson and Kaplan's studies of the DuPont Powder Company and General Motors. This suggests that capitalism only appeared in America by around 1900, after more than two decades of intense conflict between ‘capital and labour’, and became established by the 1920 s. This is the critical turning point in American business history, not the appearance of ‘managerial capitalism’, the paper argues. It concludes that America did not catch up with British capitalism until the late 1920 s because its ruling elite faced an ideological problem created by its exceptional transition from a society of simple commodity producers and semi-capitalists, particularly the threat of popular socialism. The final paper, Part 3 : ‘Adam Smith, {{the rise and fall of}} socialism, and Irving Fisher's theory of accounting’, argues that Fisher made a seminal contribution to solving this problem, but his legacy is a pathological theory of financial accounting...|$|E

Will Harmonizing Accounting Standards Really Harmonize <b>Accounting?</b> <b>Evidence</b> from Non-U. S. Firms Adopting US GAAP International harmonization of accounting standards appears to be inevitable. However, little evidence exists regarding whether harmonizing accounting standards will result in actual harmonization of accounting practices. Using a sample of non-US firms that adopt US GAAP to provide evidence on this issue, we find that most firms that adopt US GAAP adjust their accounting methods to those required by US GAAP. Properties of the firms ’ accounting numbers also change significantly after adopting US GAAP, but do not fully converge towards that of US firms. In the cross-section, regulatory oversight is associated with more successful implementation of US GAAP; firm-specific capital market incentives are not. These results suggest that harmonizing accounting standards may result in more comparable accounting methods and numbers, but that effective regulatory oversight will be important in reaching this outcome...|$|E

Such fractionalization {{is a function of}} technology and labour process, underpinned by adopted ideology. Alignment with social movement objectives overcomes the class belongingness of accounting that limits its progressive role in normal circumstances. We illustrate the role of accounting in achieving limitations to working hours and child labour, drawing on <b>accounting</b> <b>evidence</b> used to resist and support factory reform during the industrial revolution. We compare the evidence on costs and profits presented by both sides in parliamentary hearings and also with data revealed from the business accounts of the main protagonists. These comparisons show that assumptions about cost behaviour were used to exaggerate or mitigate the apparent effects of reduced working time on profits. Regressive fractions of capital were unable to resist change because they failed to consistently monopolize accounting information to impose a dominant narrative about the consequences of regulation...|$|E

I also find that lower accounting quality in the form of accrual reliability, discretionary accruals, and reporting opacity in the form of R&D impact the magnitude of settlement amounts.

40|$|Management {{accounting}} {{in recent}} times, and perhaps rightly so, {{has begun to}} gain recognition as a profession separate and complimentary to financial <b>accounting.</b> <b>Evidence</b> exists to suggest that management accountants are exposed to {{a unique set of}} ethical challenges within industry and that a significant high number of management accountants have engaged in unethical practices in performing their jobs. For the accounting profession as a whole, the growing number of corporate failures has created a credibility crisis that requires a deliberate intervention to mitigate. If this is not addressed sooner, the accounting profession stands the risk of losing relevance. Scholarship on ethical issues in accounting practice have either focused mostly on financial accounting or have sought to combine ethical issues for financial and management accounting. Various arguments have been made in recent times of the need to treat ethical issues in behavioural studies as context-specific and therefore separate ethical considerations in management accounting from financial accounting. This study adopts an approach, following various literature, that effective ethics education can help practitioners deal appropriately with ethical issues at the work place, and explores students’ and faculty members’perceptions on current practices in ethics education. As expected, faculty and students differ significantly {{on a wide range of}} issues on ethics education in management accounting.

40|$|This paper uses a new {{cross-country}} cross-industry dataset {{on investment}} in {{tangible and intangible assets}} for 18 European {{countries and the}} US. We set out a framework for measuring intangible investment and capital stocks and their effect on output, inputs and total factor productivity. The analysis provides evidence on the diffusion of intangible investment across Europe and the US over the years 2000 - 2013 and offers growth <b>accounting</b> <b>evidence</b> before and after the Great Recession in 2008 - 2009. Our major findings are the following. First, tangible investment fell massively during the Great Recession and has hardly recovered, whereas intangible investment has been relatively resilient and recovered fast in the US but lagged behind in the EU. Second, the sources of growth analysis including only national account intangibles (software, R&D, mineral exploration and artistic originals), suggest that capital deepening is the main driver of growth, with tangibles and intangibles accounting for 80 % and 20 % in the EU while both account for 50 % in the US, over 2000 - 2013. Extending the asset boundary to the intangible assets not included in the national accounts (Corrado, Hulten and Sichel (2005)) makes capital deepening increases. The contribution of tangibles is reduced both in the EU and the US (60 % and 40 % respectively) while intangibles account for a larger share (40 % in EU and 60 % in the US). Then, our analysis shows that since the Great Recession, the slowdown in labour productivity growth has been driven by a decline in TFP growth with relatively a minor role for tangible and intangible capital. Finally, we document a significant correlation between stricter employment protection rules and less government investment in R&D, and a lower ratio of intangible to tangible investment...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{an early}} case of creative accounting, and how, during British industrialization, accounting was enlisted by the manufacturers’ interest to resist demands, {{led by the}} ‘Ten hours’ movement, for limiting the working day. In contrast {{to much of the}} prior literature, which argues that entrepreneurs made poor use of accounting techniques in the British industrial revolution, the paper shows that there was considerable sophistication in their application to specific purposes, including political lobbying and accounting for the accumulation of capital. To illustrate lobbying behaviour, the paper examines entrepreneurs’ use of accounting to resist the threat of regulation of working time in textile mills. It explains why accounting information became so important in the debate over factory legislation. In doing so, it shows that a significant element was the <b>accounting</b> <b>evidence</b> of one manufacturer in particular, Robert Hyde Greg, which had a strong impact on the outcome of the parliamentary process. The paper uses archival evidence to illustrate how accounting was used in Greg’s enterprise and the reality of its economic performance. The archival evidence of actual performance is then contrasted with the figures presented by Greg to the Factories Inquiry Commission, convened by the House of Commons in 1833 - 1834 to hear witnesses from the manufacturing interest. These sets of figures are compared and contrasted and discrepancies noted. Conclusions show that the discrepancies were substantial, motivated by Greg’s incentives to present a particular view of low profits, high fixed costs, and the threat of cheaper overseas competition. The figures appeared to lend some credibility to the apparent plight of manufacturers and to Nassau Senior’s flawed argument about all profit being earned in the ‘last hour’ of the working day. The consequence was a setback for the Ten Hours movement, leading to a further intensification of political struggles over working conditions in the 1840 s. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{doctoral}} thesis {{deals with the}} evidence in accounting in terms of Information and Communication Technologies. The aim of the thesis is to gather all of the available information about the ICT in accounting, to emphasize the impacts of ICT on accounting and following draw the attention to the risks which result from the application of ICT. In order to achieve the aim the qualitative analysis and the search of the accessible information resources are used. Some parts of the thesis are demonstrated on examples. The purpose of single chapters is to discuss, according to the theoretical base defined, subsequently all phases {{of the life cycle}} of accounting documents which are presented as financial statements at the output from the accounting. Special attention is given to <b>accounting</b> <b>evidence.</b> The last part of the thesis has application nature. The use of XML in financial reporting is demonstrated there in the real existing and secured systems based on ICT. According to the analysis made I {{came to the conclusion that}} because of the requirement for the reliability of accounting the internal control system has growing importance. Regardless the technologies used there is need to preserve the evidence at the level of accounting record during all of its life cycle phases [...] when it is made out or received, when it is transferred, conversed to some other form and archived. I dealt also with another important phase of the life cycle of accounting records [...] with the evidential financial reporting. There I came to conclusion that key phases are following: Firstly, there is need to provide evidential linkage between bookkeeping and the statements assembled. Further it is crucial to assure secured transfer of the statements to the final storage place or publishing location of the statements. Finally it is desirable to consider trustworthy storage place for the statements and also its evidential method of publishing them on the web. It is possible to deduce from the statistics available that information and procedures described in the thesis do not correspond with the actual ordinary practice in the Czech Republic. More likely it can be seen as a sum of the knowledge which can be technically and legally used by the accounting entities. Its wider use can be expected in the following years...|$|E

The data supports spending control as a motive for debit use, however, the data does not provide conclusive evidence for the rational or behavioral explanations...|$|R
