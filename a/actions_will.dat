After having foreseen an approaching storm, Max must take on the responsibility to prevent it from destroying her town.

5|$|Urban renewal {{programs}} are funded {{in part by}} federal grants. The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, which created the NRHP, requires that federal agencies give consideration to the opinions of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation in assessing the impact their <b>actions</b> <b>will</b> have on listed properties and consider alternatives to any action that would destroy or significantly affect them. The listings of downtown Troy's districts and buildings therefore had the practical effect of preventing their demolition for urban renewal.|$|E
5|$|Eliot invokes {{images of}} {{original}} sin and Adam's fall when talking about the past and points out that such events can be forgotten but can still affect mankind. Eliot brings {{in the image of}} Krishna to discuss how the past and future are related: Krishna, speaking to Arjuna, claims that death can come at any time and that men should always find the divine will instead of worrying about what their <b>actions</b> <b>will</b> bring. If an individual were to follow Krishna's words then {{they would be able to}} free their self from the limitations of time. Even if it cannot be fully attained, the effort in attempting it is still important. The way for mankind to understand the divine will is through prayer and through the power of the Holy Spirit.|$|E

Despite this tragedy, Syaoran manages to become friends with other characters across his journey. Furthermore, Sakura once again develops feelings for Syaoran who {{at the same time}} starts falling for her again. The development of the characters' relationship demonstrates how while modern society depends on already existing one, a severed one can be reformed if people have the will. At the same time, Syaoran has to say goodbye to the people he met as a result of having to continue travelling. Despite also losing these new founds friends, these <b>actions</b> <b>will</b> help Syaoran grow into a young man.|$|E

25|$|To {{avoid the}} {{negative}} effects of diseconomies of scale, a firm must stick to the lowest average output cost and try to recognise any external diseconomies of scale. Moreover, on reaching the lowest average cost, a firm must either expand to other countries to increase demand for its products, or seek new markets or produce new products that do not compete with its original products. However, neither of these <b>actions</b> <b>will</b> necessarily eliminate communications and management problems often associated with large organisations.|$|E

He recovers his strength just as Mendoza pulls a knife and is about to attack Billy from behind. With his last action, Ray kills Mendoza, before dying happily.|$|E
25|$|The {{different}} effects honor instills upon men {{and women}} {{can be seen in}} the ancient world, where women and men played contrasting roles in society. Men displayed their honorable roles in public while women were restricted to the limitations of their households. While in public, women were required to avoid conversations with estranged men while only visiting places frequented by women. In the present Islamic culture, men hold a higher social status, but they also carry more responsibility in caring and providing for their family. If a man is single or childless his place in society does not waver or become lower. A woman should have a family whom she stays faithful to and respectful towards at all times. A man's <b>actions</b> <b>will</b> not greatly affect or hurt his family's standing like a woman's actions would. Women are perceived as vulnerable individuals who must be kept safe at all times. This aspect of a woman's characterization comes from her fertility and role within her family.|$|E
25|$|Many in {{the radical}} {{environmental}} direct-action movement Earth First! claim to follow deep ecology, {{as indicated by}} one of their slogans No compromise in defence of mother earth. In particular, David Foreman, the co-founder of the movement, {{has also been a}} strong advocate for deep ecology, and engaged in a public debate with Murray Bookchin on the subject. Judi Bari was another prominent Earth Firster who espoused deep ecology. Many Earth First! actions have a distinct deep ecological theme; often these <b>actions</b> <b>will</b> be to save an area of old growth forest, the habitat of a snail or an owl, even individual trees. Actions are often symbolic or have other political aims. At one point Arne Næss also engaged in environmental direct action, though not under the Earth First! banner, when he chained himself to rocks in front of Mardalsfossen, a waterfall in a Norwegian fjord, in a successful protest against the building of a dam.|$|E
