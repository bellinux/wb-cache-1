40|$|D. Rochester briefly {{reviewed}} {{the agenda for}} the meeting. Action 1 : D. Rochester to confirm that minutes for the previous meeting of May 29, 2002 were sent out to members, and, if not, to ensure that they are sent out. 1. Welcome to New Members D. Rochester welcomed new members to the Forecast and Assessments Sub-Committee. 2. New Consultation Process D. Rochester indicated that the former Forecast and <b>Assessments</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Team</b> had been elevated to a Sub-Committee of the Market Operations Standing Committee. This accounts for the change in the group’s name to the Forecast and Assessments Sub-Committee (FASC). This change in status for the group implies a move to more formal reporting procedures including pre-filing of meeting agendas and other materials, and posting of meeting minutes. 3. Update Terms of Reference D. Rochester pointed out that the change in status for the FASC gives an opportunity for some redefinition of its role, possibly to be formalized in changes to the Terms of Reference. The {{question of whether or not}} to develop rules around sub-committee membership was raised. Possible areas wher...|$|R

40|$|Final Report for the NA 22 Simulations, Algorithm and Modeling (SAM) Ontology <b>Assessment</b> <b>Team's</b> efforts from FY 09 -FY 11. The Ontology <b>Assessment</b> <b>Team</b> {{began in}} May 2009 and {{concluded}} in September 2011. During this two-year time frame, the Ontology <b>Assessment</b> <b>team</b> had two objectives: (1) Assessing {{the utility of}} knowledge representation and semantic technologies for addressing nuclear nonproliferation challenges; and (2) Developing ontological support tools that would {{provide a framework for}} integrating across the Simulation, Algorithm and Modeling (SAM) program. The SAM Program was going through a large assessment and strategic planning effort during this time and as a result, the relative importance of these two objectives changed, altering the focus of the Ontology <b>Assessment</b> <b>Team.</b> In the end, the <b>team</b> conducted an <b>assessment</b> of the state of art, created an annotated bibliography, and developed a series of ontological support tools, demonstrations and presentations. A total of more than 35 individuals from 12 different research institutions participated in the Ontology <b>Assessment</b> <b>Team.</b> These included subject matter experts in several nuclear nonproliferation-related domains as well as experts in semantic technologies. Despite the diverse backgrounds and perspectives, the Ontology <b>Assessment</b> <b>team</b> functioned very well together and aspects could {{serve as a model for}} future inter-laboratory collaborations and working groups. While the team encountered several challenges and learned many lessons along the way, the Ontology Assessment effort was ultimately a success that led to several multi-lab research projects and opened up a new area of scientific exploration within the Office of Nuclear Nonproliferation and Verification...|$|R

50|$|On July 13, the {{management}} <b>assessment</b> <b>team</b> formally delivered its final report to administrator Lautenbacher. The report concluded that Proenza's management style was ineffective, that his continued presence {{would interfere with}} {{the ability of the}} National Hurricane Center to perform its vital functions, and that Proenza should be removed as director of the center. Lautenbacher then requested that the NIST <b>assessment</b> <b>team</b> formulate specific recommendations within 2 weeks. At a joint congressional subcommittee hearing on July 19, Lautenbacher testified that he had not yet determined what final actions would be taken regarding Proenza and the National Hurricane Center. He stated, however, that his final decision would be based entirely on the recommendations of the <b>assessment</b> <b>team.</b>|$|R
40|$|Incidents of {{violence}} on college campuses, although rare, are devastating. In {{response to the}} recent spate of shootings, many {{colleges and universities have}} followed the best practice recommendations of the U. S. Department of Education (2006) and formed multi-disciplinary behavioral <b>assessment</b> <b>teams.</b> The purpose of these team is to deal with matters of crisis, disturbing behavior, and medical or psychiatric situations involving students, faculty, and/or staff in order to determine needs and appropriate responses (NACUBO, 2008). One preventative approach often employed by these <b>teams</b> is threat <b>assessment.</b> ^ Originally developed by the U. S. Secret Service to evaluate subjects who threatened public officials, threat assessment has evolved into operational activities designed to analyze dangerous situations. Using guidelines based on threat assessment principles, behavioral <b>assessment</b> <b>teams</b> investigate whether an individual has the intent and the means to carry out a threat. It is, however, unclear how many teams members are formally trained in threat assessment or if they follow the techniques and procedures threat assessment principles prescribe. ^ This descriptive-exploratory study investigated behavioral <b>assessment</b> <b>teams</b> at state flagship universities in New England (N = 6). Using a mixed methods approach, the principle research question was addressed: Are there significant differences between the behavioral <b>assessment</b> <b>teams</b> in terms of composition, practices, and responsibilities related to threat <b>assessment?</b> Behavioral <b>assessment</b> <b>team</b> leaders (N = 6) and team members (N = 28) were surveyed to determine if there is a relationship between levels of training and the functional implementation of threat <b>assessment.</b> <b>Team</b> leaders (N = 6) and executive administrators (N = 4), who were responsible for oversight of the behavioral <b>assessment</b> <b>teams,</b> were interviewed to gather information additional information about team formation, processes, and long-term strategic planning around institutional threat assessment systems. ^ The findings showed that although each team was unique, {{there were no significant differences}} in terms of the research variables. However, there was a significant positive correlation between level of training and confidence in using threat <b>assessment</b> among <b>team</b> members. Team variations allowed for a number of recommendations to be made based on the findings and on expert opinions available from the literature. ...|$|R
