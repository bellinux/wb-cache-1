5|$|January 4/5, 1879: At Jacksonville at 7 pm, sleet began, {{which turned}} to rain 90minutes later. The {{freezing}} rain covered trees, shrubbery, <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> outdoors by morning. The {{weight of the}} ice broke the limbs of many orange trees. At Fernandina, snow occurred.|$|E
5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else,</b> it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like I am going to be happy.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the late}} sixties, music in the Soviet Union was divided into two groups: music {{published}} by state record company Melodiya, <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else.</b> Under this second group were the bards, underground folk singer–songwriters.|$|E
60|$|This {{was done}} with all speed, and {{everybody}} feasted except Mayblossom and Fanfaronade, who {{looked at one another}} <b>and</b> forgot <b>everything</b> <b>else.</b>|$|R

25|$|There was a {{time when}} it was all done by hand: attendance, bookkeeping, filing <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else.</b> By the 1980s and 1990s, new {{technology}} was here to stay. From custodians to secretaries, all classified employees were impacted by new technology.|$|E
25|$|The Voyager {{spacecraft}} {{were built}} at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, and they were funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which also funded their launchings from Cape Canaveral, Florida, their tracking, <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> concerning the space probes.|$|E
25|$|In this sense, {{especially}} {{in the context of}} environmental policy, the term climate change has become synonymous with anthropogenic global warming. Within scientific journals, global warming refers to surface temperature increases while climate change includes global warming <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> that increasing greenhouse gas levels affect.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the mid-1980s}} there was little, if any, new {{investment}} in the sport, with the decline in interest being partially attributed to the complex scoring system, especially {{as it was a}} manual process then. However, this all changed with the introduction of automated electronic scoring systems. The general public only had to enter their names into the computers <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> was done automatically.|$|E
25|$|The {{divisions}} became fully exposed {{with the}} 1860 presidential election. The electorate split four ways. The Southern Democrats endorsed slavery, while the Republicans denounced it. The Northern Democrats said democracy required {{the people to}} decide on slavery locally, state by state and territory by territory. The Constitutional Union Party said {{the survival of the}} Union was at stake <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> should be compromised.|$|E
25|$|Harriet Lane ran aground while {{attempting}} to enter Pamlico Sound through Hatteras Inlet on August 29 and suffered severe damage while fast on the shoal. She was refloated {{at the cost of}} her armament, rigging, stores, provisions, <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> on board that could be heaved over the side to lighten ship. Temporary repairs completed on September 3, she proceeded to Hampton Roads, arriving September 8, 1861.|$|E

25|$|Qutb's mature {{political}} views always centered on Islam – Islam {{as a complete}} system of morality, justice and governance, whose sharia laws and principles should be the sole basis of governance <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> in life – though his interpretation of it varied. Qutb's political philosophy {{has been described as}} an attempt to instantiate a complex and multilayer eschatological vision, partly grounded in the counter-hegemonic re-articulation of the traditional ideal of Islamic universalism.|$|E
25|$|Díaz Pacheco and {{his brother}} Faustino were active members of the cadets. The {{organization}} became the official youth branch of the Nationalist Party. In accordance with the beliefs of Albizu Campos, organization and discipline were considered the keys to victory, {{in the struggle for}} Puerto Rico's independence. Cadets were required to wear a uniform of white pants and gloves, <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> - the shirt, tie, belt, boots, military cap - was black. Officers wore a white jacket over the black shirt and tie, and a white officer's cap.|$|E
25|$|Khamenei issues decrees {{and makes}} the final {{decisions}} on economy, environment, foreign policy <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> in Iran. Khamenei regularly meets with president, cabinet members, head and officials of the judiciary branch, parliamentarians, among others, and tells them what to do. Khamenei has also fired and reinstated Presidential cabinet appointments. Khamenei meets with foreign dignitaries, however he does not travel overseas; if anyone wishes to see him, that person must travel to Iran. Apart from his time in Najaf as a student, Khamenei travelled to Libya during his time as President.|$|E

25|$|The {{simplest}} approximation {{is to keep}} {{only the}} usual J term, <b>and</b> discard <b>everything</b> <b>else.</b> This will generate a flow in J, analogous to the flow in t at the fixed point of λ in the ε expansion.|$|R
25|$|The Germans {{also had}} a card up their sleeve. With control over the dams on the Rur, they could release the water from them and flood the Rur valley <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> {{downstream}} of {{it as far as}} the Meuse and into the Netherlands. That would cause large scale destruction and destroy Allied bridges over the Rur, isolating all troops east of the river. The Allies did not fully recognize the strategic importance of the dams for some time, and only days {{before the end of the}} offensive they made their first specific moves towards them.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{the cuisine}} of Estonia has been heavily {{dependent}} on seasons and simple peasant food, which today is influenced by many countries. Today, it includes many typical international foods. The most typical foods in Estonia are black bread, pork, potatoes, and dairy products. Traditionally in summer and spring, Estonians like to eat everything fresh – berries, herbs, vegetables, <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> that comes straight from the garden. Hunting and fishing have also been very common, although currently hunting and fishing are enjoyed mostly as hobbies. Today, it is also very popular to grill outside in summer.|$|E
25|$|By then, Serbia {{had only}} one airline carrier, Jat Airways shareholding, a company with its own statute, Board of Directors and {{management}} bodies. Air Serbia {{is the result of}} a strategic partnership agreement between the Etihad Airways and Jat Airways, making the company to fulfill regulatory requirements, and got registered with the Business Registers Agency (APR). Subsequently, Jat Airways changed its name to Air Serbia <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> was kept unchanged, continuing to be a joint stock company, the commercial entity registered in the APR, and with all the rights and obligations of Jat Airways. At that moment, Jat Airways was working at full power and fulfilling the obligations of regular and charted passenger transportation, as agreed in its business plan for 2013.|$|E

25|$|The {{first and}} chief article is this: Jesus Christ, our God and Lord, died for our sins and was raised again for our {{justification}} (Romans 3:24–25). He alone is the Lamb of God who takes away {{the sins of}} the world (John 1:29), and God has laid on Him the iniquity of us all (Isaiah 53:6). All have sinned and are justified freely, without their own works and merits, by His grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, in His blood (Romans 3:23–25). This is necessary to believe. This cannot be otherwise acquired or grasped by any work, law or merit. Therefore, it is clear and certain that this faith alone justifies us... Nothing of this article can be yielded or surrendered, even though heaven and earth <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> falls (Mark 13:31).|$|E
25|$|The game is set 62 {{years in}} the future, {{following}} a great change that has returned magic to the world. The emergence of magic, {{the outbreak of the}} VITAS plagues, the Computer Crash of 2029, the Euro-Wars, and the fevers for independence of Amerindian tribes, Chinese provinces, <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> that came with the many struggles that ravaged Europe and Asia left the world's governments tumbling and falling. The United States was broken into substates. Monetary value was lost. The world had to rebuild, and rebuild they did, this time {{in the image of the}} megacorporations that seized power. Taking advantage of the laws that had been passed years ago, and using their newfound freedom, the megacorps began impressing their power on the failing governments. Before long the world was transformed. Boundaries were redrawn, and the political landscape was changed forever.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{its fifth}} edition release, XML 1.0 {{differed}} from XML 1.1 in having stricter requirements for characters {{available for use}} in element and attribute names and unique identifiers: {{in the first four}} editions of XML 1.0 the characters were exclusively enumerated using a specific version of the Unicode standard (Unicode 2.0 to Unicode 3.2.) The fifth edition substitutes the mechanism of XML 1.1, which is more future-proof but reduces redundancy. The approach taken in the fifth edition of XML 1.0 and in all editions of XML 1.1 is that only certain characters are forbidden in names, <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> is allowed to accommodate suitable name characters in future Unicode versions. In the fifth edition, XML names may contain characters in the Balinese, Cham, or Phoenician scripts among many others added to Unicode since Unicode 3.2.|$|E
