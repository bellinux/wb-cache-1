40|$|Bovine milk {{proteins}} {{have a low}} absorption rate due to gastric acid-induced coagulation. <b>Acidified</b> <b>milk</b> remains liquid under acidic conditions; therefore, the absorption rate of its protein may differ from that of untreated milk. To investigate how this would affect muscle protein synthesis (MPS), we compared MPS after ingestion of acidified versus skim milk in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats swam for 2 h and were immediately administered acidified or skim milk, then euthanized at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min afterwards. Triceps muscle samples were excised for assessing fractional synthetic rate (FSR), plasma components, intramuscular free amino acids and mTOR signaling.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to study whether the anticipated added weight gain from ad libitum <b>acidified</b> <b>milk</b> feeding compared to restricted milk feeding during the preweaning period can be maintained after weaning until slaughter. The study was conducted by comparing first the growth performance of eleven bull calves until an average age of 126 days (Phase 1) when the five calves were fed <b>acidified</b> <b>milk</b> either ad libitum (FM) for 17 weeks or when six calves were given <b>acidified</b> <b>milk</b> restrictively (5 l per day, RM) for nine weeks. Bulls had ad libitum access to grass silage and concentrate. Secondly, the performance of bulls having an average age of 175 days until slaughter (at an average age of 429 days) at a carcass weight of approximately 290 kg was assessed (Phase 2). All animals were fed grass silage ad libitum and concentrate at a level of 620 g kg- 1 of dietary dry matter. Calves fed <b>acidified</b> <b>milk</b> ad libitum grew significantly (P < 0. 01) faster than those fed restrictively during the first nine weeks of Phase 1 (1003 vs. 725 g per day). The bulls in the RM group grew a little but not significantly faster during Phase 2, the growth rates being 1197 vs. 1207 g per day. The feed conversion, weight (535 vs. 533 kg at slaughter) and slaughter results were equal. Similarly the life-time gains did not differ being 1174 (FM) and 1141 (RM) g per day, respectively.

40|$|Lactose (milk sugar) is a {{fermentable}} substrate. It can be fermented {{outside of}} the body to produce cheeses, yoghurts and <b>acidified</b> <b>milks.</b> It can be fermented within the large intestine in those people who have insufficient expression of lactase enzyme on the intestinal mucosa to ferment this disaccharide to its absorbable, simple hexose sugars: glucose and galactose. In this way, the issues of lactose intolerance and of fermented foods are joined. It is only at the extremes of life, in infancy and old age, in which severe and life-threatening consequences from lactose maldigestion may occur. Fermentation as part of food processing can be used for preservation, for liberation of pre-digested nutrients, or to create ethanolic beverages. Almost all cultures and ethnic groups have developed some typical forms of fermented foods.

Pyrosequencing targeting the 16 S rRNA gene allowed to identify 361 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) to the genus/species level. Among {{lactic acid bacteria}} (LAB), Streptococcus thermophilus and some lactobacilli, mainly Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus reuteri, were the most abundant species, with differences among the samples. Twelve groups of microorganisms were targeted by viable plate counts revealing a dominance of mesophilic cocci. All rennets were able to <b>acidify</b> ultrahigh-temperature-processed (UHT) <b>milk</b> as shown by pH and total titratable acidity (TTA). Presumptive LAB isolated at the highest dilutions of <b>acidified</b> <b>milks</b> were phenotypically characterized, grouped, differentiated at the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) -PCR analysis, and subjected to 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. Only 18 strains were clearly identified at the species level, as Enterococcus casseliflavus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and Streptococcus thermophilus, while the other strains, all belonging to the genus Enterococcus, could not be allotted into any previously described species. The phylogenetic analysis showed that these strains might represent different unknown species. All strains were evaluated for their dairy technological performances. All isolates produced diacetyl, and 10 of them produced a rapid pH drop in milk, but only 3 isolates were also autolytic. This work showed that animal rennet pastes can be sources of LAB, mainly enterococci, that might contribute to the microbial diversity associated with dairy productions...|$|R

This study explores the impact of probiotic yogurt on metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers, with a parallel study of gut microbiota dynamics. The randomised cross-over {{study was conducted in}} fourteen healthy, young men to test probiotic yogurt compared with milk acidified with 2 % d-(+) -glucono-δ-lactone during a 2 -week intervention (400 g/d). Fasting assessments, a high-fat meal test (HFM) and microbiota analyses were used to assess the intervention effects. Baseline assessments for the HFM were carried out after a run-in during which normal milk was provided. No significant differences in the inflammatory response to the HFM were observed after probiotic yogurt compared with <b>acidified</b> <b>milk</b> intake; however, both products were associated with significant reductions in the inflammatory response to the HFM compared with the baseline tests (assessed by IL 6, TNFα and chemokine ligand 5) (P< 0 · 001). These observations were accompanied by significant changes in microbiota taxa, including decreased abundance of Bilophila wadsworthia after <b>acidified</b> <b>milk</b> (log 2 -fold-change (FC) =- 1 · 5, P adj= 0 · 05) and probiotic yogurt intake (FC=- 1 · 3, P adj= 0 · 03), increased abundance of Bifidobacterium species after <b>acidified</b> <b>milk</b> intake (FC= 1 · 4, P adj= 0 · 04) and detection of Lactobacillus delbrueckii spp. bulgaricus (FC= 7 · 0, P adj< 0 · 01) and Streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus (FC= 6 · 0, P adj< 0 · 01) after probiotic yogurt intake.

40|$|Pectin, a {{plant cell}} wall polysaccharide, is mainly used in food {{industries}} for its gelling and stabilizing properties. In industrial applications, pectin is usually widely extracted from citrus peels, {{and in some}} intances, apple pomace is also used. Lime and lemon are the preferred citrus species used in the extraction of pectin, while orange and grapefruit are used less often. In the food industry, pectin is widely employed {{in the production of}} jams and jellies, confectionary products and bakery fillings. The fine structure of pectin is affected by many parameters, such as the origin of raw material and extraction conditions. This structural variability impacts greatly on pectin functional properties. The other major use of pectin concerns the stabilization of <b>acidified</b> <b>milk</b> drinks and yogurts.

Powders varied in stated heat treatment classification (based on WPNI) and country of manufacture. It was shown that low heat powders (WPNI ≥ 6. 0) and powders without heat classification coagulated {{more slowly than}} medium heat or high heat treated powders. Gel strength (storage modulus, G’) of the <b>acidified</b> <b>milks</b> was also influenced by heat treatment classification. Low heat and unclassified powders produced weaker gels (40 - 50 Pa) than medium and high heat milk powders (> 228 Pa), however low heat powders from Sweden did not follow the same trend. Using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), concentrations of major proteins were determined. It was shown that powders {{with lower levels of}} native whey protein had better coagulation characteristics (faster coagulation times and higher gel strengths) than milk powders with higher native whey protein concentration. This correlated to increasing heat treatment classification and WPNI. These findings suggest that the heat induced modifications of milk proteins enhance coagulation properties, and that low heat milk powders are less suitable for acid milk gel applications...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSodium {{carboxymethyl}} cellulose (CMC) and soybean soluble polysaccharide (SSPS) are negatively charged polysaccharides {{that are used}} to prevent casein aggregation in <b>acidified</b> skimmed <b>milk</b> drinks (ASMDs). The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the effect of CMC and SSPS combination on the stability of <b>acidified</b> skimmed <b>milk</b> drinks in comparison to their individual effects. Stability was evaluated based on the changes in sedimentation ratio, viscosity, zeta potential, and particle size distribution of casein micelles. Increased CMC or SSPS concentration resulted in decreased sedimentation ratio and size diameter, while viscosity and zeta potential increased. The use of CMC-SSPS blend at the ratio of 1 : 3 showed better stability of ASMDs compared to when the two stabilizers were used individually. Sedimentation ratio and size diameter obtained from the ratio of 1 : 3 (CMC-SSPS) had no clear significant difference (P[*]<[*] 0. 05) with those stabilized by the ratio of 0 : 4, but CMC was crucial in controlling the blend viscosity and zeta potential, hence improving stability. Furthermore, SSPS showed a better stabilization behavior than CMC when they are used alone. It can therefore be suggested that a combination of CMC-SSPS is more effective than the individual use of the two stabilizers in stabilizing ASMDs, and thus, CMC can effectively supplement SSPS in the production of stable ASMDs...|$|R

On a comparative basis, the effect of cross-linking by mTGase on the physical properties of chemically <b>acidified</b> UHT goats <b>milk</b> and UHT cows milk has been performed. Transglutaminase treatment (3  U mTGase/g protein) of cows and goats milk was conducted at 40  °C for 60  min and terminated by heat treatment (85  °C/ 10  min) for enzyme inactivation. Gelation was induced by acidification with 40  g. L− 1 d-glucono-δ-lactone. Monitoring gel formation by oscillatory rheometry revealed that the incubation of milk with mTGase accelerated gelation, which occurred at a higher pH for cows milk in comparison to goats milk. Electrophoretic analysis revealed that under the same conditions, nearly 31 % of the cows milk proteins were cross-linked by the action of mTGase compared to only 9. 6 % of the goats milk proteins. This resulted in increased gel stiffness and reduced syneresis of the acid gels of both systems, but the extent of the effect depended on the milk source. In general, even with the mTGase treatment, goats milk gels were much weaker than cows milk gels.

They grow synergistically in <b>milk</b> by <b>acidifying</b> <b>milk,</b> produce specific aroma compounds and lactic acid which impact {{the quality of the}} yoghurt. Imported cultures are widely used in dairy industry to stabilize the technological properties which cause a change in our natural flora and flavour. Starters from traditional yoghurts have to be preserved. Under this perspective, the aim {{of this study was to}} determine the medium requirements of mixed starter cultures for production of starter bacteria which has been isolated and characterized before. Determination of medium requirements were done in a whey-based media. Since bacteriophages were one of the most important problem in dairy industry, to prevent cultures from phage adsorption, media was treated with different salts which can bind free calcium ions. Salts were examined for cell viability and phage infection effects. From these studies Na 2 HPO 4 + KH 2 PO 4 with 2 % of medium addition was chosen as the most effective. Mineral requirements of the mixed cultures were determined. The best combination; 10, 5, 50 ppm for Fe 2 +, Mn 2 +, Mg 2 + ions with 0, 939 desirability were used for initial mineral content of medium. Fermentation constants for mixed cultures were determined. Pure culture fermentations and mixed culture fermentations were performed. According to results mixed culture inoculations gave higher maximum specific growth rates; 0, 9188 h- 1 and 0, 7323 h- 1 for cocci and bacilli while 0, 855 h- 1 and 0, 659 h- 1 were obtained for cocci and bacilli from single strain fermentations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Lactococcus lactis is a {{lactic acid}} {{bacterium}} {{that has been used}} for centuries in the production of a variety of cheeses, as these bacteria rapidly <b>acidify</b> <b>milk</b> and greatly contribute to the flavour of the fermentation end-products. After a short growth phase during cheese ripening L. lactis enters an extended non-growing state whilst still strongly contributing to amino acid-derived flavour formation. Here, a research approach is presented that allows investigation of strain- and amino acid-specific flavour formation during the non-growing state. Results Non-growing cells of five selected L. lactis strains were demonstrated to degrade amino acids into flavour compounds that are relevant in food fermentations and differs greatly from production of flavour compounds using growing cells. As observed earlier in other research set-ups and with other microorganisms, addition of NADH, &# 945;-ketoglutarate and pyridoxal- 5 -phosphate was demonstrated to be essential for optimal flavour formation, suggesting that intracellular pools of these substrates are too low for the significant production of the flavour compounds. Production of flavours during the non-growing phase strongly depends on the individual amino acids that were supplied, on the presence of other amino acids (mixtures versus single compounds), and on the strain used. Moreover, we observed that the plasmid-free model strains L. lactis MG 1363 and IL 1403 produce relatively low amounts of flavour components under the various conditions tested. Conclusions By using this simplified and rapid approach to study flavour formation by non-growing lactic acid bacteria, lengthy ripening periods are no longer required to assess the capacity of strains to produce flavours in the long, non-growing state of dairy fermentation. In addition, this method also provides insight into the conversion of single amino acids versus the conversion of a mixture of amino acids as produced during protein degradation. The generated results are complementary to earlier generated datasets using growing cells, allowing assessment of the full flavour forming potential of strains used as starter cultures in industrial food fermentation processes...|$|R
40|$|Calcium in milk {{products}} stimulates gastric acid secretion and inhibits the cytolytic activity of intestinal contents. Based on these effects, it was hypothesised that calcium might lessen {{the severity of}} food borne intestinal infections. The possible differential effects of a low calcium milk and normal {{milk products}} (milk, <b>acidified</b> <b>milk,</b> and pasteurised yoghurt) on the resistance of rats to a salmonella infection was therefore studied. Rats were infected orally with Salmonella enteritidis just after food consumption. The first day after infection, faecal salmonella counts of the yoghurt fed rats were significantly {{lower than those of}} the other groups. Thereafter, faecal salmonella excretion declined rapidly in all high calcium groups, whereas rats fed the low calcium milk continued to excrete high numbers of salmonella. The reduced colonisation resistance to salmonella of rats fed low calcium milk might be caused by the high cytolytic activity of faecal water or a high iron concentration in faecal water, already present before infection, or both. The reduced resistance of these rats corresponded with a large infection induced increase in the cytolytic activity of faecal water, an appreciable reduction in apparent iron absorption, and a large increase in faecal mucin and alkaline phosphatase excretion. In yoghurt fed rats, only minor infection induced changes in luminal parameters were noticed. The rats fed milk and <b>acidified</b> <b>milk</b> always showed intermediate reactions. In conclusion, in addition to fermentation by yoghurt bacteria, calcium in milk products strongly enhanced the resistance to salmonella infection by lowering luminal cytolytic activity or diminishing the availability of iron for pathogen growth, or both...|$|E
40|$|In our study, two {{acidification}} procedures, three stabilizers (guar gum, xanthan and carboxymethylcellulose) and two protein-fortifying agents (skim {{milk powder}} and whey powder) were evaluated {{based on their}} impact on the quality characteristics of frozen yogurts. Indirect acidification (blending of plain <b>acidified</b> <b>milk</b> with ice cream mix) was found to favour texture while direct acidification (fermentation of ice cream mix with starter culture), although it improved viscosity of mixes, did not enhance the sensory acceptance of frozen yogurts. The addition of 0. 2 % xanthan gum and the partial substitution (at the ratio of 3 : 1) of skim milk powder by whey powder increased overall acceptance and creaminess. © 2008 Society of Dairy Technology...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} ultrafiltration, diafiltration, and preacidification of milk on the {{partition}} of specific milk components between retentate and permeate was studied. Percent retention (for any component Y) was determined as: [l - (%Y in soln. permeate/%Y in soln. retentate) ] X 100 where %Y in soln. = [%Y/(%Y + %H 20) ] Simultaneous samples of retentate and permeate were taken at several points during each process. Percent retention of total solids, fat, total protein, rennet clottable nitrogen, lactose, total calcium, ionic calcium, sodium, phosphorous, and riboflavin was determined at each sampling point. Percent retention of β-carotene, vitamin B 12, retinol, and zinc was determined {{at different stages of}} ultrafiltration only. As UF proceeded, percent retention of total solids, total protein, total calcium, ionic calcium, sodium, phosphorous, and riboflavin increased. Percent retention of lactose was not affected and was 0 - 4 %. Percent retention of fat, rennet clottable nitrogen, zinc, retinal, β-carotene, and vitamin B 12 was 99 - 100 %. As diafiltration proceeded, percent retention of total solids, lactose, total calcium, ionic calcium, sodium, phosphorous, and riboflavin increased. Percent retention of these nutrients was increased when compared to ultrafiltration alone. Milks with lower pH values (resulting from preacidification) also had lower percent retention of total calcium and phosphorous than milks with normal pH values. Percent retention of sodium was lower during ultrafiltration and diafiltration of <b>acidified</b> <b>milk</b> when compared to ultrafiltration and diafiltration of normal milk. Percent retention of other nutrients was not affected by acidification. Loss of whey proteins into permeate resulted in a lower recovery of total protein after diafiltration than ultrafiltration alone and ultrafiltration of <b>acidified</b> <b>milk.</b> These proteins were determined to be α-lactogobulin and β-lactogobulin...|$|E
40|$|Donkey milk is {{recently}} gaining attention {{due to its}} nutraceutical properties. Its low {{casein content}} does not allow caseification, so {{the production of a}} fermented milk would represent an alternative way to increase donkey milk shelf life. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the possibility of employing selected Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus plantarum isolates for the production of a novel donkey milk fermented beverage. Lysozyme resistance and the ability to <b>acidify</b> donkey <b>milk</b> were chosen as main selection parameters. Different fermented beverages (C 1 –C 9) were produced, each with a specific combination of isolates, and stored at refrigerated conditions for 35 days. The pH values and viability of the isolates were weekly assessed. In addition, sensory analysis was performed. Both S. thermophilus and L. plantarum showed a high degree of resistance to lysozyme with a Minimum Bactericidal Concentration > 6. 4 mg/mL for 100 % of S. thermophilus and 96 % of L. plantarum. S. thermophilus and L. plantarum showed the ability to <b>acidify</b> donkey <b>milk</b> in 24 h at 37 °C, with an average ΔpH value of 2. 91 ± 0. 16 and 1. 78 ± 0. 66, respectively. Four L. plantarum and two S. thermophilus were chosen for the production of fermented milks. Those containing the association S. thermophilus/L. plantarum (C 1 –C 4) reached a pH lower than 4. 5 after 18 h of fermentation and showed microbial loads higher than 7. 00 log cfu/mL until the end of the storage period. Moreover, comparing the microbial loads of samples containing both species and those containing S. thermophilus alone (C 5), we highlighted the ability of L. plantarum to stimulate S. thermophilus replication. This boosted replication of S. thermophilus allowed to reach an appropriate pH in a time frame fitting the production schedule. This was not observed for samples containing a single species (C 5 –C 9). Thus, L. plantarum strains seem to be good candidates in the production of a novel type of fermented milk, not only for their probiotic potential, but also for the enhancing effect on S. thermophilus growth...|$|R
40|$|Single-strain {{cultures}} of Leuconostoc dextranicum and L. mesenteroides {{were found to}} be capable of utilizing acetaldehyde in both <b>acidified</b> and nonacidified <b>milk</b> cultures at 21 and 30 C.

40|$|The {{capacity}} of {{lactic acid bacteria}} to produce exopolysaccharides (EPS) conferring microorganisms a ropy phenotype could be an interesting feature from a technological point of view. Progressive adaptation to bile salts might render some lactobacilli able to overcome physiological gut barriers but could also modify functional properties of the strain, including the production of EPS. In this work some technological properties and the survival ability in simulated gastrointestinal conditions of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis 193, and Lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis 193 +, a strain with stable bile-resistant phenotype derived thereof, were characterized in milk in order {{to know whether the}} acquisition of resistance to bile could modify some characteristics of the microorganism. Both strains were able to grow and <b>acidify</b> <b>milk</b> similarly; however the production of ethanol increased {{at the expense of the}} aroma compound acetaldehyde in milk fermented by the strain 193 +, with respect to milk fermented by the strain 193. Both microorganisms produced a heteropolysaccharide composed of glucose and galactose, and were able to increase the viscosity of fermented milks. In spite of the higher production yield of EPS by the bile-resistant strain 193 +, it displayed a lower ability to increase viscosity than Lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis 193. Milk increased survival in simulated gastric juice; the presence of bile improved adhesion to the intestinal cell line HT 29 -MTX in both strains. However, the acquisition of a stable resistance phenotype did not improve survival in simulated gastric and intestinal conditions or the adhesion to the intestinal cell line HT 29 -MTX. Thus, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis 193 presents suitable technological properties for the manufacture of fermented dairy products; the acquisition of a stable bile-resistant phenotype modified some properties of the microorganism. This suggests that the possible use of bile-resistant derivative strains should be carefully evaluated in each specific application considering the influence that the acquisition of a stable bile-resistant phenotype could have in survival ability in gastric and intestinal conditions and in technological properties. © 2011 Proprietors of Journal of Dairy Research.
