5|$|Washington's second inauguration {{took place}} in the Senate Chamber of Congress Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (the first at this site) on March 4, 1793. The presidential oath of office was {{administered}} by Supreme Court associate justice William Cushing. Washington's inaugural address was just 135 words, the shortest to date. This inauguration was brief and simple, <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> to the extravaganza four years earlier, which, in the eyes of many, had all the trappings of a monarchical coronation.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{started the}} 1950–51 season with an unbeaten 201 in a Shield match against Queensland. At 438minutes, {{it was his}} longest {{first-class}} innings. In the return match, he scored 138notout in just 118minutes in a successful run-chase, <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> to his double-century. In a tour match against the visiting England team at the SCG before the Test series, Miller scored 214, having been 99notout at stumps on the previous day. He hit 15 fours and three sixes. However, he made ducks in consecutive matches leading into the First Test in Brisbane. Miller scored 15 and eight on a rain-affected pitch, and took match figures of 3/50 in an Australian victory, dismissing Dewes twice. He had another quiet match in the Second Test, scoring 18 and 14 and taking a match total of 2/55. After struggling {{in the first two}} Tests, Miller rediscovered his batting form with 98 against the tourists for New South Wales.|$|E

40|$|The {{past twenty}} years has seen three {{government}} shutdowns and an unprecedented number of filibusters. While these trends seem symptomatic of increasing political polarization it is exceedingly difficult to measure {{the difference between the}} two parties over a long period of time. Using data from the American National Election Survey, Stefan Krasa and Mattias Polborn examine policy divergence in presidential elections between 1972 and 2008, finding <b>a</b> <b>sharper</b> <b>contrast</b> between the parties today. They attribute this divide to the realignment of both parties on cultural issues...|$|R
50|$|More specifically, antithetical {{parallelism}} {{is defined}} as text where the meaning {{in the first part}} of the couplet contrasts with an opposite theme contained in the second part (see above). The use of opposites clarifies both extremes. In poetry the use of opposites can bring <b>a</b> <b>sharper</b> <b>contrast</b> to <b>an</b> image and provide a greater focus to the desired message. It is often marked by the use of the conjunction ‘but’, placed between two statements to juxtapose them and helps the reader or to view both the positive and negative perspectives of the text.|$|R

5000|$|There {{have been}} three {{versions}} of the [...] "Steve" [...] character, the creators having twice made considerable adjustments to his design. Steve's initial design ended up being a one-off execution limited to the unaired precursory pilot (not {{to be confused with}} the series premiere, entitled [...] "Pilot"). By the season premiere, Scott Grimes had begun voicing Steve, and his design was made taller, more filled out, and less geeky. After early seasons of the series, Steve was remodeled again. This time he was made softer, more emotional, cuter and more endearing, creating <b>a</b> <b>sharper</b> <b>contrast</b> to his father Stan's ruggedness and machismo.|$|R
50|$|By 1986, ABC only {{televised}} 13 Monday Night Baseball games. This was <b>a</b> fairly <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> to the 18 {{games that}} were scheduled in 1978.

25|$|The album {{not only}} helped {{establish}} Danny!'s freewheeling and emotional persona (<b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> from the cynical and extremely sarcastic characteristics he would reveal on subsequent albums), but also helped reiterate the ethic of DIY {{used by many}} emerging underground hip-hop artists at the time, such as Little Brother, Lupe Fiasco and Tanya Morgan, who too would see moderate popularity on the Internet translate into a recording contract with major or independent record labels.|$|E
25|$|It was {{pleasant}} {{to see the}} women riding alone on horseback, managing their mounts to perfection. They formed <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> to their Persian sisters, who either sit behind their husbands or have their steeds led by the bridle; and instead of keeping silence in public, as is the rule for the shrouded women of Iran, these farmers' wives chaffered and haggled with {{the men in the}} bazar outside the city, transacting business with their veils thrown back.|$|E

50|$|Walbaum was a punchcutter, who carved steel punches used as {{a master}} to stamp matrices, the moulds used to cast metal type. Walbaum was born in Steinlah, a {{district}} {{of the town of}} Haverlah in modern Lower Saxony. Based first in Goslar and later in Weimar, he created type in the Didone style, also known as the 'rational' or 'modern' style. This style, inspired by the work of type designers such as the Didot family and Giambattista Bodoni, involved <b>a</b> <b>sharper</b> <b>contrast</b> between thick and thin strokes than was used previously, and a more modular design abstracted from handwriting. Jan Tschichold described his designs as 'the most beautiful German version' of modern type. He also created type in the Fraktur style of blackletter.|$|R
25|$|President Erdoğan {{also made}} a written statement, stating that the voters' {{decision}} could not be argued against and that all parties needed to show responsibility and sensitivity in the government forming process. His statement was seen as <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> to his perceivably polarising and partisan speeches made during the election campaign. Erdoğan's absence from the public gaze after the election, which {{was seen as a}} contrast to his frequent appearances on news channels and public rallies before the election, was also mocked.|$|E
25|$|Chibiusa's {{affections}} {{come into}} conflict. Despite being self-aware {{of the fact}} that Usagi Tsukino and Mamoru Chiba are her biological parents, she does not immediately identify them as such, instead suspiciously viewing them as strangers who look like them. There is evidence that Chibiusa has a hard time identifying Usagi and Mamoru as being her parents since she sees such <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> in personality between their present and future selves. She also reacts differently toward Usagi and Mamoru than she does towards King Endymion and Neo-Queen Serenity, being more respectful to the latter but more spontaneous to the former; it is not clear if she prefers one set over the other. However, she always calls her teenage father Mamoru as Mamo-chan (in the 20th century), an affectionate nickname by Usagi, and has an innocent crush on him, much to Usagi's fury.|$|E
25|$|Wilkinson's {{assistant}} coach, Gomer Jones, {{took over}} as head coach in 1964, a move Wilkinson engineered himself. His first year {{would prove to be}} <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> from Wilkinson's early years as the Sooners went 6–4–1. They started the season 1–3 with three consecutive losses to Southern California, Texas and Kansas. The final loss came in the Gator Bowl to Florida State. Prior to the game, it was found that four of Oklahoma's starters had signed professional football contracts before their college eligibility had expired. Those four were dismissed from the team prior to the bowl game, ultimately causing Oklahoma to lose the game 36–19. The next season's team fared no better, going 3–7, Oklahoma's worst record, percentage wise, since it went 0–1 its inaugural season in 1895. This brought the Jones era to a quick close, although he did remain at Oklahoma as the athletic director, a role he also held while he was head coach.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} constituent of the Royalist {{strength was}} tactical air power. The Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF), backed by an all out effort by their Air Commando advisers, doubled their daily sortie rate to 44. 7th Air Force (7th AF) committed 48 daily sorties, with 12 more held ready {{as a quick}} reaction force. This was <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> to the 200 sorties per day of U.S. tactical air that had been available {{just a few months}} prior during Kou Kiet. There was a concerted effort to more efficiently use such U.S. air power as was received. For air strike control, the U.S. Air Attaché promulgated a designated battle area (DBA) containing the Communist units threatening Long Tieng. The main Communist gun parks and troop staging areas could be bombed by jets using all-weather methods under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) in certain areas. Communist bases on the Plain of Jars, down to Ban Ban, and east along Route 7 to the North Vietnamese border were free fire zones. All other air strikes would be under the existing rules of engagement, which included targets being acquired, marked and directed by Raven Forward Air Controllers operating from Long Tieng's 20 Alternate airfield.|$|E
25|$|In stylistic {{terms the}} motets of the Gradualia form <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> {{to those of}} the Cantiones sacrae publications. The vast {{majority}} are shorter, with the discursive imitative paragraphs of the earlier motets giving place to double phrases in which the counterpoint, though intricate and concentrated, assumes a secondary level of importance. Long imitative paragraphs are the exception, often kept for final climactic sections in the minority of extended motets. The melodic writing often breaks into quaver (eighth-note) motion, tending to undermine the minim (half-note) pulse with surface detail. Some of the more festive items, especially in the 1607 set, feature vivid madrigalesque word-painting. The Marian hymns from the 1605 Gradualia are set in a light line-by-line imitative counterpoint with crotchet pulse which recalls the three-part English songs from Songs of sundrie natures (1589). For obvious reasons, the Gradualia never achieved the popularity of Byrd's earlier works. The 1607 set omits several texts, which were evidently too sensitive for publication {{in the light of the}} renewed anti-Catholic persecution which followed the failure of the Gunpowder Plot in 1605. A contemporary account which sheds light on the circulation of the music between Catholic country houses, refers to the arrest of a young Frenchman named Charles de Ligny, who was followed from an unidentified country house by spies, apprehended, searched and found to be carrying a copy of the 1605 set. Nevertheless, Byrd felt safe enough to reissue both sets with new title pages in 1610.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{eventual}} hit game Family Feud ran against As The World Turns from July 12, 1976, until April 22, 1977, {{it did not}} become a hit for ABC until its move to the mornings. Only when ABC made its first move to a one-hour soap with All My Children did trouble really began for As the World Turns (and Days of our Lives), since ABC kept that serial's starting time at 1:00/noon, meaning that fans of that serial who tuned to NBC or CBS would miss {{the last half of}} that day's storyline (or, contrariwise, would not, if they watched until the mid-program commercial break and then changed channels, pick up the As The World Turns or Days of Our Lives activities from the episode's beginning, since ABC strategically placed its break several minutes after the bottom of the hour). Further, All My Children's emphasis on youth-oriented, sexier story lines provided <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> to the domestic, almost quaint tone of As the World Turns (and to a lesser degree, the melodramatic, somewhat topical Days). On January 16, 1978, ABC ballooned its decade-old One Life to Live to the 2:00 PM/1:00 PM starting time, compounding the other networks' headaches. These factors helped contribute to the fall of As The World Turns from the top spot in the ratings {{at the end of the}} 1978-79 season. After finishing the previous season tied with Another World for number one in the Nielsens, As the World Turns fell to fourth behind All My Children, General Hospital, and The Young and the Restless.|$|E
50|$|Park Yongrae’s poetic {{career was}} {{essentially}} quaratpartite. Beginning in the mid-1940s until {{the publication of}} his first collection Snow Grains (Ssarangnun), primarily exposits upon a motif of the primal consciousness of loneliness and despair. The poems from the second period of his career, which includes all the work after Snow Grains (Ssarangnun) until the published collection of Foxtails (Gangajipul), focus upon the purity of natural phenomena, celebrating it as such devoid from the artifice and pretense that contaminates the world constructed by man. Park’s poetry from his third stage of writing, after the publication of Foxtails (Gangajipul) to the publication of Baekbarui Kkotdaegung, provides <b>a</b> <b>sharper</b> <b>contrast</b> to the poems of the two previous stages of Park’s career. These poems, unlike those of the first two periods which celebrated a rustic lyrical consciousness, also include tentative explorations of relationships between man, as well as addressing address the weighty specter of death.|$|R
5000|$|The Canadian {{political}} thinker Charles Blattberg {{has argued}} that such events ought {{to be seen as}} part of a process in which Canadians advanced a [...] "border" [...] as distinct from a [...] "frontier" [...] - from east to west. According to Blattberg, a border assumes <b>a</b> significantly <b>sharper</b> <b>contrast</b> between the civilized and the uncivilized since, unlike a frontier process, the civilizing force is not supposed to be shaped by that which it is civilizing. Blattberg criticizes both the frontier and border [...] "civilizing" [...] processes.|$|R

25|$|In 1903, {{the first}} intercollegiate dual meet {{took place between}} Yale University and Columbia University. The Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association held its first tournament in 1905, which soon sparked many more wrestling tournaments for both college and {{university}} students and high school students. Edward Clark Gallagher, a football and track and field athlete at Oklahoma A College (now Oklahoma State University), launched wrestling as an official varsity sport just before World War I and with his team launched a dynasty, with undefeated matches from 1921 to 1931. In 1927, Raymond G. Clapp published the rules for collegiate wrestling, and the next year, the first NCAA Wrestling Team Championship took place on March 30 to 31 {{on the campus of}} Iowa State College. The rules of collegiate wrestling marked <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> to the freestyle wrestling rules of the International Amateur Wrestling Federation (IAWF) and the AAU. From then on, collegiate wrestling emerged as a distinctly American sport. College and high school wrestling grew especially after the standardization of the NCAA wrestling rules, which applied early on to both collegiate and scholastic wrestling (with high school modifications). More colleges, universities, and junior colleges began offering dual meets and tournaments, including championships and having organized wrestling seasons. There were breaks in wrestling seasons because of World War I and World War II, but in the high schools especially, state association wrestling championships sprung up in different regions throughout the 1930s and 1940s. As amateur wrestling grew after World War II, various collegiate athletic conferences also increased the number and quality of their wrestling competition, with more wrestlers making the progression of wrestling in high school, being recruited by college coaches, and then entering collegiate competition.|$|E
500|$|... "Artificial Energy" [...] is {{followed}} {{on the album}} by the poignant and nostalgic Goffin–King song [...] "Goin' Back". With its chiming 12-string Rickenbacker guitar and polished harmony singing, band biographer Johnny Rogan has noted that the song provides <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> to the negativity and violence of the opening track. The song's lyrics describe an attempt {{on the part of}} the singer to reject the cynicism that comes with being an adult in favor of the innocence of childhood. Thematically, the song recalled the title of the Byrds' previous album, Younger Than Yesterday, and the understated pedal steel guitar playing of Red Rhodes gives the track a subtle country flavor.|$|E
500|$|Castle of Cagliostros [...] {{portrayal}} of the characters was changed to better identify with Miyazaki's concept of a [...] "hero" [...] and to remove a sense of apathy in the story. This resulted in Lupin being a happy-go-lucky and upbeat thief who drives and lives out of a Fiat 500; <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> to the scheming and lecherous Lupin who drives expensive cars like the Mercedes-Benz SSK because it was [...] "Hitler's favorite". The changes would also impact secondary characters like Jigen and Goemon, changing their serious and cold personalities into friendly and humorous; even the erotic elements involving the femme-fatale Fujiko were dropped.|$|E

50|$|The {{continental}} {{crust is}} {{the layer of}} igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks that forms the continents and the areas of shallow seabed close to their shores, known as continental shelves. This layer is sometimes called sial because its bulk composition is more felsic compared to the oceanic crust, called sima which has a more mafic bulk composition.
