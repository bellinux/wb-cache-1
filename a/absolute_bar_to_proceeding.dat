They held that the plan of affirmative action must first be transitional in nature and serve in fact to correct situations of imbalance by restoring equality at the starting point and should not set out to reproduce them artificially even when the effects of past discrimination have been wiped out. An affirmative action plan has to be (1) necessary (2) aiming to correct a statistical imbalance (3) not result in an <b>absolute</b> <b>bar</b> <b>to</b> hiring non-minority people (4) temporary, with an end date or goal (5) allow flexibility for hiring non-minorities.|$|R
50|$|Nor, as a {{practical}} matter, could we require the police to specify in advance all persons {{that they were going}} to search at the time they execute the warrant. A search warrant is, by definition, an anticipatory authorization. The police must offer the magistrate sufficient information to confine the search, but must leave themselves enough flexibility to react reasonably to whatever situation confronts them when they enter the premises. An <b>absolute</b> <b>bar</b> <b>to</b> searching persons not named in the warrant would often allow a person to frustrate the search simply by placing the contraband in his pocket. I cannot subscribe to any interpretation of the Fourth Amendment that would support such a result, and I doubt that this Court would sanction it if that precise fact situation were before it.|$|R

Under that ruling, Courts generally do not hear motions to quash Congressional subpoenas; even when executive branch officials refuse to comply, the Courts tend to rule that such matters are [...] "political questions" [...] unsuitable for judicial remedy.

The attempt to realize the Marxist idea of a democratic Socialism without that, might easily fail into the abortive birth of an acephalous monster, the secular development of administrative Socialism give the world over to a bureaucratic mandarinate, self-satisfied, interfering and unteachable, with whom wisdom would die. And yet we Socialists can produce in our plans no <b>absolute</b> <b>bar</b> <b>to</b> these possibilities. Here I can suggest only in the most general terms methods and certain principles. They need to be laid down as vitally necessary to Socialism, and so far they have not been so laid down. They have still to be incorporated in the Socialist creed. They are essentially principles of that Liberalism out of whose generous aspirations Socialism sprang, but they are principles that even to-day, unhappily, do not figure in the fundamental professions of any Socialist body.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a matter}} known to all persons of common {{intelligence}} {{in the state of}} Oklahoma that the Governor takes the position that legal executions are judicial murder; and that he refuses to permit them to be carried into effect, upon the ground that he would thereby become a party thereto; and that he has expressed his fixed determination to strictly adhere to this policy until the expiration of his term of office. As this is a capital conviction, and as the Governor's action presents an <b>absolute</b> <b>bar</b> <b>to</b> the enforcement of the law in Oklahoma, we cannot, without a failure to discharge our duty, omit to take judicial notice of, and pass upon, this position of the Governor, as unpleasant as it is for us to do so.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{the number of}} Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) {{enforcement}} actions has soared, as has {{the number of cases}} before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). At the same time, events have demonstrated that two problems may arise from the lack of coordination between anticorruption investigations and ICSID arbitration proceedings. First, anticorruption investigations may reveal arbitral decisions to be incorrect {{due to a lack of}} evidence regarding corruption in the formation of investment contracts. Second, the 2 ̆ 2 corruption defense 2 ̆ 2 —an emerging affirmative defense that allows host states to invoke corruption in the formation of investment contracts as an <b>absolute</b> <b>bar</b> <b>to</b> liability—creates a perverse incentive that encourages states to expropriate investors 2 ̆ 7 assets, or to renegotiate for burdensome new terms, following FCPA investigations. This Note explores the characteristics of the corruption defense as applied by ICSID tribunals, including the evidentiary burden placed upon the host state to assert the defense. It then proposes a framework for FCPA-ICSID interaction designed to strengthen the defense and to further the goal of eradicating global corruption. It proposes using tools such as waiver and disgorgement, contract cure, and communication between FCPA enforcement authorities and ICSID tribunals to remedy the problems identified above...|$|R
