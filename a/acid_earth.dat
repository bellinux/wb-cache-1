First, the raw material is reduced into fine particles to increase the contact surface. Doing so maximize {{the effect of the}} acid leaching which is the next step. The acid leaching then occurs at very high temperature using hydrochloric acid. At the end of the leaching all metal molecules (excluding titanium) react to produce chloride compounds. Specifically, iron molecules form ferric chloride (FeCl3) and alumina molecule form aluminum trichloride (AlCl3). Silica is then removed by simple filtration becoming the main leftover of the process. Afterward, the aluminum trichloride is removed by precipitation.

The palm oil supply from Malaysia has increased apparently over the last two decades due to vast increase in production. Crude palm oil (CPO) obtained from the mesocarp of palm oil fruit undergoes several stages of refining processes in order to produce refined, bleached palm oil (RBDPO). Currently, in Malaysia, the type of refining used is physical refining. This method involved the processing stages of degumming, bleaching and deodorization. From refiners point of view, degumming and bleaching processes are recognized as critical areas in the palm oil refinery and need to be carefully monitored, because any imperfection during these processes will tremendously affect the later stages of refining processes and finally affect the finished product. These stages are identified as the major contributors to the total operating cost of the plant due to the cost of chemicals (phosphoric <b>acid</b> and bleaching <b>earth)</b> that are being used in these processes. In this research, a process model for degumming and bleaching operation will be designed in order to help the refiners to predict the exact ratio of phosphoric <b>acid</b> and bleaching <b>earth</b> to the crude palm oil.

The features of the 2 : 1 minerals of the four soils, resulting from an aluminization process in depth and a desaluminization process towards the surface, had a strong influence on Cs+ fixation.

The purpose is the removal of gums, trace metals, pigments, peroxides, oxidation products and other breakdown products in the crude oil by adsorption on the active surface of the bleaching earth to improve colour and stability of the final oil (Siew et al., 1992). This research aims to study the Optimization of Bleaching Earth and Extraction of Free Fatty Acid (FFA) in Palm Oil Refinery Process which involves process of degumming and bleaching using neutral and acid-activated clays. Degumming is the pre-treatment stage of physical refining crude palm oil and these stages are identified as the major contributors to the total operating cost of the plant due {{to the cost of}} chemicals (phosphoric <b>acid</b> and bleaching <b>earth)</b> that are being used in these processes. Bleaching absorbs the undesirable impurities and other pigments. It also reduces the oxidation products, absorbs the phospholipids precipitated by phosphorus acid, and removes any excess present in the oil. Last stage for physical refining is deodorization. The pre-treated oil is deoerated and then heated to deodorization temperature and pressure. Under these condition, which the free fatty acids, which are still present in the oil are distilled together with the more volatile odoriferous and oxidation products such as aldehydes and ketone, which otherwise will affect the odor and the taste of the oil.

In addition production of sewage sludge will have doubled by 2005 and disposal options are increasingly limited. Alternative treatment options are required for both these waste types that offer re-use potential. In this study the carbonisation and activation of these wastes has been demonstrated to be an effective means of treatment that also produces adsorbents that can be safely and usefully applied to treatment of aqueous waste streams. Previous studies have examined the production of clay-carbon adsorbents from spent bleaching earth and limited studies have been conducted on producing adsorbents from sewage sludges. However, the majority of these have limited investigations to production of oils from sludge and no previous studies of caustic tar carbonisation have been conducted. Treatment of caustic tar involved neutralisation with HCl and absorption of the organic content of the waste by Fullers or <b>Acid</b> Activated <b>Earth.</b> The clay-waste mix was subsequently carbonised (375 °C for 2 hours) and activated using an optimised ZnClj activation procedure (600 °C for 1 hour). Activated carbons were produced from sewage sludges using carbonisation (500 °C for 2 hours), CO^ activation (700 °C for I hour) and ZnCl^ activation (450 °C for 2 hours and 600 °C for 1 hour). The adsorbents produced had well developed porosity and large surface areas (up to 225 mVg for caustic tar derived carbons and up to 995 mVg for sewage sludge based carbons) and were adsorptive of a range of organic pollutants common in effluents.

Amino acid homochirality provides an unambiguous way of distinguishing between abiotic vs. biotic origins. Proteins made up of mixed D- and L-amino acids would not likely have been efficient catalysts in early organisms {{because they could not}} fold into bioactive configurations such as the a-helix. However, enzymes made up of all D-amino acids function just as well as those made up of only L-amino acids, but the two enzymes use the opposite stereoisomeric substrates. There are no biochemical reasons why L-amino acids would be favored over Damino <b>acids.</b> On <b>Earth,</b> the use of only L-amino acids in proteins by life is probably simply a matter of chance. We assume that if proteins and enzymes were a component of extinct or extant life on Mars, then amino acid homochirality would have been a requirement. However, the possibility that Martian life was (or is) based on D-amino acids would be equal to that based on L-amino acids. The detection of a nonracemic mixture of amino acids in a Martian sample would be strong evidence for the presence of an extinct or extant biota on Mars. The finding of an excess of D-amino acids would provide irrefutable evidence of unique Martian life that could not have been derived from seeding the planet with terrestrial life (or the seeding of the Earth with Martian life). In contrast, the presence of racemic amino acids, along with non-protein amino acids such as alpha-aminoisobutyric acid and isovaline, would be indicative of an abiotic origin, although we have to consider the possibility that the racemic amino acids were generated from the racemization of biotically produced amino acids...|$|R
40|$|<b>Acid</b> treated diatomaceous <b>earth</b> (ATDE) from {{a mining}} site in Kenya was {{evaluated}} for its removal of F from aqueous solutions using adsorption batch experiments. The effect of initial F concentration, adsorbent dosage, contact time, temperature, pH and competing anions was studied. The adsorption process was very fast reaching an initial equilib- rium in just 10 min. Fluoride adsorption onto ATDE increased strongly from just about 40 % to over 92 % when the solution temperature was raised from 293 to 303 K. The process was however, almost unresponsive to pH changes drop- ping {{by a margin}} of - ions does not affect F adsorption onto ATDE. More so apart from the Cl- ions which marginally reduced F adsorption onto ATDE, there was no obvious effect of the SO 4 2 -, NO 3 - and PO 4 3 - ions on F uptake by ATDE. Complete F removal (100 % adsorption) could be achieved at 400 mg/L initial F concentra- tions using 0. 5 g/mL ATDE batch loading ratio at 303 - 313 K and pH = 3. 4 ± 0. 2. The F adsorption iso- therm was well correlated to the Freundlich and Langmuir models and could be classified as H-Type according to Giles classification of isotherms. The maximum Langmuir F adsorption capacity of ATDE was 51. 1 mg/g. It has been demonstrated that a diatomaceous mineral from Kenya could be use as an inexpensive adsorbent for the removal of F ions from aqueous streams...|$|R
40|$|The loaded salts (NaCl, KCl, MgCl₂, and CaCl₂) have {{significantly}} different {{influence on the}} contribution of dehydration and depolymerization reactions to the decomposition of sugar structures during cellulose fast pyrolysis at 325 °C. The structures of salt-loaded celluloses already become cross-linked during heating-up period, {{largely due to the}} enhanced dehydration reactions catalyzed by inorganic species. As stronger Lewis <b>acids,</b> the alkaline <b>earth</b> metal ions (Mg²⁺ and Ca²⁺) are more effective than the alkali metal ions (Na⁺ and K⁺) to catalyze the dehydration reactions of sugar structures, leading to the formation of more cross-linked cellulose for the alkaline earth metal chloride-loaded celluloses. As a result, the majority of Mg and Ca are transformed into water-insoluble forms during the heating-up period, largely reducing the catalytic effects of these species on the dehydration of sugar structures during the subsequent isothermal pyrolysis. Rather, the dehydration of non-sugar structures is enhanced because the catalytic species are already bonded with non-sugar structures. In contrast, the dehydration of sugar structures during the heating-up period is less significant for the NaCl-loaded and KCl-loaded celluloses. The majority of Na and K are water-soluble after the heating-up period so that the dehydration of sugar structures is further enhanced during isothermal pyrolysis. The loaded salts have less influence on the depolymerization reactions. The contribution of depolymerization reactions to sugar conversion is relatively small during the heating-up stage, but increases substantially during isothermal pyrolysis...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{comprises}} three parts. One reviews pedological {{research in}} the area, discusses the soil forming factors and considers the classification of the soils studied, A chapter is devoted to each pedogenic factor and describes its role in soil formation on the Reserve. Part two comprises a study of several small limestone grasslands. Their microtopography is described using maps which also show soils. Three surfaces are recognised; the surrounding peat surface, a sub-peat 'drift' surface and a dissected limestone surface. Each sub-group in the soil complex is described, i, e. rendzina, brown calcareous soil, <b>acid</b> brown <b>earth</b> and peat podzol: profiles, with analyses, are included. Drift or head is shown to dominate the soil parent material. A contribution from the limestone {{is present in the}} shallow soils and dominates in some rendzinas. The inter-relationships of the soils are discussed: they form a sequence reflecting increasing depth of drift. In the shallow soils plants obtain nutrients from the limestone thus offsetting leaching. In the deeper soils the limestone merely maintains free drainage, A history of the grasslands is reconstructed. The smaller areas were, almost certainly peat covered but parts of the larger ones may have remained peat free. Part three discusses eight of the main soil sub-groups on the Reserve. Their distribution, morphology and pedogenesis are considered: profiles are given with analyses. Iron humus podzols are described and the origin of their platey structure and parent material: these soils are shown to be sedentary. Theories on the formation of peaty gleyed podzols are examined {{in the light of the}} work at Moor House, Clay movement in some brown earths is discussed. The distribution pattern of the sub-groups is outlined: a drainage sequence containing calcareous members is present. Parent materials of soils on the Pennine escarpment are briefly examined.

5|$|Alkaline {{digestion}} {{is carried}} out in 30–45% sodium hydroxide solution at about 140°C for about three hours. Too high a temperature leads {{to the formation of}} poorly soluble thorium oxide and an excess of uranium in the filtrate, and too low a concentration of alkali leads to a very slow reaction. These reaction conditions are rather mild and require monazite sand with a particle size under 45μm. Following filtration, the filter cake includes thorium and the rare earths as their hydroxides, uranium as sodium diuranate, and phosphate as trisodium phosphate. This crystallises trisodium phosphate decahydrate when cooled below 60°C; uranium impurities in this product increase with the amount of silicon dioxide in the reaction mixture, necessitating recrystallisation before commercial use. The hydroxides are then dissolved at 80°C in 37% hydrochloric acid. Filtration of the remaining precipitates followed by addition of 47% sodium hydroxide results in the precipitation of thorium and uranium at about pH 5.8. Complete drying of the precipitate must be avoided, as then air may oxidise cerium from the +3 to the +4 oxidation state, and the cerium(IV) formed can then liberate free chlorine from the hydrochloric <b>acid.</b> The rare <b>earths</b> again precipitate out at higher pH. The precipitates are then neutralised by the original sodium hydroxide solution, although most of the phosphate must first be removed to avoid precipitating rare-earth phosphates. Solvent extraction may also be used to separate out the thorium and uranium, by dissolving the resultant filter cake in nitric acid. The presence of titanium hydroxide is deleterious as it binds thorium and prevents it from dissolving fully.|$|R
