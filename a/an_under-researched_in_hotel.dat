From 1964 to the mid- 1980 s, {{many of the}} largest banks in the world, including the Nordic banks, entered into international strategic alliances. Almost all of these alliances are now defunct. We follow the Norwegian banks in the Nordic consortia and find that domestic rivals do not cooperate but international rivals do. Legal prohibitions in the Nordic countries on entry by foreign banks underpinned the cooperation. The cooperation broke down when changes in domestic regulations permitted the Nordic banks to establish operations in each others' domestic markets. ...|$|R

The case of psychoanalysis is considered {{as an example of}} a therapeutic enterprise that has foundered on its temporal recipes. The demand for shorter, sharper, faster therapeutic procedures is making analysis increasingly marginal as therapy. The writings of psychoanalysts from Freud to Lacan on time and analysis are considered and contrasted with more recent concepts of appropriate therapeutic temporal formats. It is suggested that the concept of faith as well as the unsuccessful search for an effective therapy need to be considered as explanations of psychoanalysis's inexorable lengthening. ...|$|R

This paper investigates how cumulative impact is addressed within the Scottish planning system through a case study focused on small-scale wind developments in Aberdeenshire UK. Using assessments of planning applications and stakeholder interviews, the findings revealed a disjuncture between considering applications on their own merit versus more strategic and long term considerations. The lack of sufficient guidance tailored to the specific scale of development poses significant proportionality problems. We argue for a more positive dialogue between planners, developers and supporting agencies championing adaptive management and social learning frameworks {{in order to improve}} CI processes and outcomes...|$|R

Using a semiotic interpretation of mothers’ discourses, we underline the identity motivations for purchasing luxury apparel for their pre-adolescent children. The paper shows that when shopping for luxury brands for their pre-adolescent children, mothers manage discrepancies between their “real” and “idealized” selves as well as the pushes and pulls of being a mother and a woman. This study addresses <b>an</b> <b>under-researched</b> area <b>in</b> the retail literature, investigating the way young mothers fluctuate between four identity positions. In the process of shopping, they variously adopt identification, idealization, transmission and creation positions that retailers should address in their store organisation, furnishing and decoration of corners, visual communication and digital in-store innovations...|$|R

These questions are {{the starting point for}} this critical book, in which the authors unravel the social and interpersonal processes – shaped by deeply entrenched socio-cultural norms – that come to bear on parenthood decision-making in the South African context. Drawing on the narratives of white, Afrikaans women and men, Men's Pathways to Parenthood uses an innovative discursive method to illuminate the roles masculinity, whiteness, class, and heteronormativity play in these accounts. Men's Pathways to Parenthood addresses <b>an</b> <b>under-researched</b> topic <b>in</b> gender studies – namely, men and reproductive decision-making – and will be an important resource for scholars in gender studies, sexualities, and reproductive health, as well as those interested in innovative approaches to discursive research...|$|R
40|$|This paper unpacks the {{meanings}} {{and implications of}} the mobility of international students in vocational education – <b>an</b> <b>under-researched</b> group <b>in</b> the field of international education. This four-year study found that transnational mobility {{is regarded as a}} resourceful vehicle to help international students ‘become’ the kind of person they want to be. The paper justifies the value of re-conceptualising student mobility as a process of ‘becoming’. Mobility as ‘becoming’ encompasses students’ aspirations for educational, social, personal and professional development. Theorising mobility as ‘becoming’ captures international students’ lived realities and has the potential to facilitate the re-imagining of international student mobility with new outlooks. By theorising mobility as ‘becoming’, this research suggests the importance of drawing on the integrated and transformative nature of Bourdieu’s forms of capital in understanding the logics and practice of the social field – international student mobility...|$|R

The study, which was conducted in four communities employed qualitative methods to uncover the many complexities of involuntary return {{and its implications for}} development <b>in</b> southern countries; <b>an</b> <b>under-researched</b> area <b>in</b> the migration-return nexus. The findings highlight the effect of the sudden loss of remittances on family expenditure, especially the education of children, and reveal the coping strategies adopted by returnees in the absence of formal reintegration assistance. Successful reintegration has not occurred for the majority of returnees who are being induced by unfavorable economic circumstances and the absence of reintegration assistance to re-emigrate. The absence of an explicit migration policy has led to the neglect of returnees and caused the nation to miss the potential benefits of return migration for development...|$|R
40|$|The {{significance}} of mediatization in countryside settings is <b>an</b> <b>under-researched</b> topic <b>in</b> media studies. In this paper, based on qualitative fieldwork {{carried out in}} two rural areas in Sweden, we study how mediatization integrates the prospects of cosmopolitan social change. The current phase of the mediatization process, which imposes a more dynamic register of networked communication, nourishes {{a new type of}} cosmopolitan identity in the countryside. As shown in the study, this development is constituted by complex configurations of different forms of mobility and connectivity. We argue that these spatial processes are socially structured, meaning that certain social groups are better equipped, through the appropriation of network capital, for turning cosmopolitan dispositions into a transformative resource, a ‘cosmopolitan politics of place’. Such alterations of the social structure may successively destabilize the relationship between ‘the urban’ and ‘the rural’...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} is to propose a {{theoretically}} grounded conceptual framework regarding the relationships existing between customer education and customer perceived value, mediated by customer evaluation skills. Methodology: This is a conceptual paper whose analytical approach draws heavily on theoretical evidence published in service marketing and management literature. Findings: Customer education is <b>a</b> <b>under-researched</b> concept <b>in</b> the service marketing and management literature. It is a multilevel process aimed at informing and training customers in order to increase their knowledge levels (basic, general, and deep). It affects customer perceived value in terms of benefits (skill of information evaluation, satisfaction and appreciation, perceived risk, purchasing power, and protection of rights and interests), and outlays (economic commitment, product complexity, information accessibility, time employed, cognitive and behavioral effort, and resulting stress). Customer evaluation skill mediates this relationship. Practical implications: Providing to customers a number of aspects and tools for evaluatin...|$|R

Using baseline data from {{the evaluation of the}} Business in Mind program, a mental health promotion intervention amongst SME owner/managers, this study investigated: (i) prevalence of high/very high psychological distress, past-month sickness absenteeism and presenteeism days in SME owner/managers; (ii) associated, self-reported lost productivity; and (iii) associations between work, non-work and business-specific factors and work attendance behaviours. In our sample of 217 SME owner/managers 36. 8 % reported high/very high psychological distress. Of this group 38. 7 % reported past-month absenteeism, 82. 5 % reported past-month presenteeism, and those reporting presenteeism were 50 % less productive as than usual.

It presents {{an overview of the}} available European research evidence on {{the health of}} homeless women and the factors that influence homeless women’s access to health services in different national health care and welfare systems. Although the knowledge base is patchy, thus limiting the extent to which comparisons can be made between countries, there is considerable evidence of relatively poor health among homeless women. Furthermore, the effectiveness with which the health care needs of homeless women are met depends, to a large degree, on enabling factors such as the nature and accessibility of national health care services. The chapter concludes that there is considerable scope for further research within and across European countries in order to better establish how women’s homelessness affects their health and how homeless women experience health care services across Europe...|$|R

40|$|It is {{a concern}} that {{children}} represent <b>an</b> <b>under-researched</b> group <b>in</b> flood education and preparedness because as adults {{they are more likely}} to experience flooding as the climate changes, and because it suggests their potential today, as agents of change, is being undervalued. Using action-based, participatory methodology with 7 - 9 year old children, a creative and inclusive flood education resource was developed as a stimulus for learning. Evaluation revealed that young children can learn about flooding and preparedness, and that intergenerational learning from child to parent can also occur, with children transferring the messages learned in school to home. However, thematic analysis suggests a number of key factors such as family relationships (empowerment of children) and the parents’ disconnection and dissociation from risk limit the success of intergenerational learning. The implications of these in relation to flood education, flood preparedness and household resilience levels are explored...|$|R

However, understanding how {{interpersonal skills}} are taught or learned, and how technology {{can play a}} part in this, is yet <b>an</b> <b>under-researched</b> area <b>in</b> CSCW and HCI research. To start addressing this gap, our research explores the learning processes of counselling students, for whom developing interpersonal skills forms a fundamental part of their university education. We followed an iterative process to gain an in-depth understanding of a specific counselling program in the UK, combining interviews and low-fidelity technology prompts. Overall, 26 participants comprising tutors, students and expert counsellors took part. Our findings first provide insights into the highly collaborative and social learning process of the students. We highlight the complexity of interpersonal reflection as a crucial process for developing counselling skills, and identify the challenges to learning that students face. Second, we build on this understanding to draw out empirically grounded design considerations around opportunities for technology innovation in this setting...|$|R

A questionnaire for determining the factors influencing OHPMC has been specifically designed keeping in view the contextual requirements. Two hundred faculty members from four medical colleges in Rawalpindi are selected as the sample subjects. Statistical tool and techniques such as, descriptive analysis, scale reliability analysis, factor analysis, correlation analysis, and multiple regression analysis are conducted on the collected data. The results achieved through all these analysis will help the academicians and practitioners to recognize the factors that influence the OHPMC and take necessary measures to enhance them.

However it is <b>a</b> <b>under-researched</b> area <b>in</b> terms of effective methods and computational tools for easy industrial implementation and applications. In this research, Monte Carlo simulation, response surface method and most probable point analysis are used to quantify probabilistic characteristics of the shape and dimensional errors in net-shape metal forming processes. A two-step optimisation approach is developed to minimise systematic errors using a direct compensation method for die shape modification and to reduce random variations through a control variable method. Two industrial based case studies, i. e. forging of a 2 D aerofoil component and forward extrusion of a cylinder are conducted with good results obtained for much improved accuracy. This approach can be easily applied to general metal forming processes for both 2 D and 3 D cases where achievable accuracy is an essential criterion...|$|R
