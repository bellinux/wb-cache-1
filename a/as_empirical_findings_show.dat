30|$|Often {{two main}} {{categories}} of work arrangements are formed: standard and nonstandard work (Osterman 2000; Houseman and Osawa 2003; Mückenberger 1985 a, 1985 b, 2010). Standard work is usually considered as working full-time in a permanent job which in addition offers {{full access to}} {{the social security system}} and implies a clear assignment to a certain employer (Rubery 2005). Consequently, deviations from this type of employment are classified <b>as</b> nonstandard. <b>Empirical</b> <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> that compared to standard workers there is a greater risk for nonstandard workers to lose employment, {{to be part of the}} low wage sector, of being excluded from additional (also fringe) benefits as well as from firm based-training (Autor 2001; Dütsch 2011; Kalleberg 2011; Mertens and McGinnity 2004; Jahn and Pozzoli 2011).|$|R

We used daily stock returns for the period January 2002 â€“December 2011 to study the contagion effects from the United States (US) to India.

40|$|Social {{cohesion}} {{is introduced}} as {{an answer to}} the question “What holds societies together?” by academics, politicians and the public opinion. However, the proliferation of conceptualisations and operationalisations seems to have made social cohesion (too) broad, (too) vague, and (too) popular to handle. Contrary, disciplinary boundaries seem to have led to protectionism, disregarding social cohesion’s multi-disciplinary aspects. First of all, the conceptualisation and operationalisation of social cohesion at the community level is researched. Theory formation started {{in the early days of}} sociology when new social cleavages and changes - such as industrialisation and urbanization - appeared and a shift from pre-modern to modern communities was apparent. Sociologists such as Emile Durkheim (1893) and Ferdinand Tönnies (1887) tried to answer the question “What holds societies together?” by interpreting social cohesion in a more normative manner in pre-modern communities and in a more structural manner in modern communities. While Tönnies envisioned a clear shift in the content of social cohesion, Durkheim did not and emphasised that two types of social cohesion formed two faces of the same reality. At the end of the 20 th century, again, new social cleavages and changes - such as globalisation and migration - created a renewed interest in social cohesion, as industrialised communities shifted to post-industrialised communities. Reviewing the multi-disciplinary literature on social cohesion, it is apparent that although starting from different angles, perspectives on social cohesion overlap and coincide into an umbrella concept, composed out of different dimensions. Using a case study of 308 Flemish communities, all perspectives and dimensions are operationalised and it is clear that theory and empirical research are not identical. The theoretical expectation of one single latent concept is not confirmed <b>as</b> the <b>empirical</b> <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> two types of social cohesion existing in the same post-industrialised community: a traditional type and a modern type of social cohesion. Next, the multilevel question is investigated whether there is a relation between community social cohesion and individual social capital. Both concepts are often regarded as the elixirs for the ills of society and positive relations between the two types of community social cohesion (traditional and modern) and the two elements of individual social capital (trust and participation) are expected. The <b>empirical</b> <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> the expected positive relations between modern social cohesion and trust, between traditional social cohesion and participation. However, they also show an unexpected negative relation between modern social cohesion and participation, and no relation between traditional social cohesion and trust. Again, there is not a clear and uniform confirmation of the existing theory. The results in this dissertation therefore lead to important reflections and new insights in social cohesion and social capital research. For instance, although the indicator of participation remains important to identify, the conclusion cannot be to lower the level of modern social cohesion to generate more active individuals with higher levels of social capital. Future research could therefore focus on the different aggregated levels in which social cohesion can be found, as different relations at different levels could interfere with each other: an individual’s participation behaviour can be triggered by modern social cohesion within one level of analysis, eliminating or even reversing the effect of modern social cohesion at another level of analysis. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The Swedish Agency for Higher Education {{evaluated}} in 2007 the nursing programs at Swedish Universities, and confirmed that several programs lacked {{definition of the}} main subject of the discipline;- namely caring- and/or nursing. The caring science disciplines showed indications of increasing signs of fragmentation, in that sub-disciplines were evolving. There is a unique foundation of theoretical knowledge that is specific for the caring professions grounded in caring theory and philosophy. For some reason the theoretical foundation and contexture of providing care seems to fade off with time in clinical practice, {{as well as an}} explicated theory-practice gap; that theory does not go along with clinical practice. An assumption in this thesis is that caring theory somehow seems to evaporate; as nurses become clinically active- caring theory {{does not seem to be}} much reflected upon. The overall aim was to investigate into the meaning of caring to nurses in municipal elderly care, and into their explicit and implicit understanding of caring theory in their daily practice. The theoretical perspective was caring science, while the epistemological frame was of a phenomenological hermeneutical life world approach. Data was gathered by interviews with nurses working in elderly care and analyzed to grasp the structure of the phenomenon of caring in theory and practice. The thesis comprises four studies of which three empirical was consolidated with a Jean Watson’s specific caring theory, ending up in a better understanding of the approach of caring in nursing and the role of theory in practice. The findings of the studies show that the lived experience of caring as narrated by the participating nurses comprises both implicit and explicit theoretical foundation to existential caring theory. The explicit use of theory or certain theoretical affiliation was not obvious; rather what may be theoretical inputs was expressed as the importance of being present and the necessity of having a health perspective in caring. By illuminating caring and concepts from caring theory, the meaning of caring in their professional lived experience, the primary intention or choice of working as nurses became apparent again. There seems to be different perspectives related to caring theory, but <b>as</b> the <b>empirical</b> <b>findings</b> <b>shows,</b> there is a consensus behind what caring is, both in theory and in practice. As a result from the analysis the aim of caring itself may be more salient and focused if based on existential phenomenological caring concepts and theory, as this corresponds with the nurses understanding of holistic intentional caring with a health perspective. A gap exists, but is more related to organizational restrictions such as role constraints and time pressure than to the meaning of caring in theory and practice. Mediating care is a concept that embraces the implications of all the outcome concepts of the analysis and it has the possibility of being the expression of immanent and transcendent dimensions in caring. Mediating care represents the expression of our understanding of life, our values and norms. It is given expression through the insights into, and the ways we connect to one another, our ability as carers (nurses) to reach out to another in his or her being, as well the understanding of ones own being in caring. Theoretical and practical reflection and cultivation of clinical sensibility has the opportunity of inspiring for an expanded caring consciousness, manifested in the mediation of care...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, eco–city as a {{sustainable}} urban model has gained increasing prevalence and {{evolved into a}} hegemonic urban discourse. As a future vision of urban transformation, eco–city is being increasingly translated into concrete projects, strategies, and policies, mainstreaming urban sustainability and being replicated and proliferated across the world. This study aims to examine, {{by means of a}} discursive analytical approach, the construction of eco–city in the Swedish urban context – urban planning and development – with a particular emphasis on definitional and thematic issues, cultural bias, selectivity, framing, and political action. I use six analytical devices to guide the analysis of four documents <b>as</b> an <b>empirical</b> material. <b>Findings</b> <b>show</b> that the construction of eco–city in the Swedish urban context entails aspects of other sustainable urban models: smart city, sustainable city, green city, and compact city, making eco–city as an umbrella metaphor for such models. Also, only combining all projects, it is clear that eco–city has evolved into a comprehensive vision, embracing most of the requirements and norms set for a city to be ecological. While the concept of eco–city tends to incorporate social and cultural dimensions of urban sustainability, the prime focus remains on economic and environmental aspects – in other words, social considerations are marginal compared to economic and environmental ones. Moreover, the discourse of eco–city draws on and is informed by an array of established discourses. Building on previous discursive constructions of reality, it changes urban reality – aspects of its economic and environmental dimensions, by generating new ways of thinking about urban practices through new amalgamations of established discourses. The technological orientation of eco–city has links to urban–economic–political processes of regulation as well as involves selective framing in terms of discursive interpretation of urban–environmental crises as material processes, recontextualization of urban- economic imaginaries, reference to particular meta–discourses, and privileging of particular discursive chains. Technologically-oriented eco–city can be conceptualized as a speciﬁc urban practice which is contingent upon hegemonic discourses on the economic, technological and environmental regulation in relation to urbanization and on the agency of various actors advocating energy efficiency and green technologies and forming alliances on sustainable urban issues. Furthermore, the discourse of eco–city is exclusionary, in that it leaves out some topics and facts relating to the negative direct and indirect environmental effects of the so–called green and energy efficiency technologies. In addition, the discourse of eco–city is shaped by cultural frames associated with environmental and climate awareness and the role of technology in enabling and catalyzing sustainable urban transformation. Finally, using different mechanisms, political action has a great impact on the discourse of eco–city in relation with the environment, climate change, and shifts to low–carbon/low-energy cities. It plays a role in the expansion and success of eco–city...|$|R
