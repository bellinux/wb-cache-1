30|$|In {{the late}} 1950 s, {{automatic}} transport vehicles {{began to be}} used in warehouse automation and factory operations, and Japan began to introduce automatic transport vehicle technology from then on. In the mid- 1970 s, due to the application of integrated circuit technology and electronic technology in automatic transport vehicles, the automatic transport vehicles were significantly improved in terms of automation and control performance. The automatic transport vehicle entered the production system as a production component and has also been rapidly developed [1]. During this period, European companies standardized the size and structure of pallets for containers, which accelerated the development of automated transport technology in Europe [2]. The first International Conference on Unmanned Pallets was held in June 1981 in London, England, which has shown a breakthrough in the technology of automatic transport vehicles [3]. In 1984, General Motors first tried an <b>automated</b> <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle</b> on their flexible assembly system. Two years later, the number of automatic transport vehicles increased to 1407, making it the world’s largest automatic transport vehicle user [4]. In 1985, due to the development of computer microprocessors and the rise of control technology, computer communication and identification technology entered the field of automatic transport vehicles, and automatic transport vehicles developed toward intelligence [5]. In 1987, it was reported that Sweden first used automatic transport vehicles in the field of logistics systems in 1969 [6]. In 1974, the Swedish Volvo Car Company applied automatic transport vehicles to their car assembly lines. This improvement has been a huge success, not only reducing labor, assembly time, and assembly failures, but also speeding up capital flow by 43 % [7]. Many Western European countries have followed suit because of the practical economic benefits of this application. In the 1980 s, the wave of automatic transport vehicles in Europe flooded into the US market. Many US companies transferred advanced automatic guided trolley technology to Metron through technology introduction and joint ventures ([8]. In 1978, a direct computer-controlled <b>automated</b> <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle</b> system introduced from Europe was successfully applied at the Keebler Distribution Center in Chicago, USA [9]. In 1981, John Corporation of the USA applied automated transport vehicles to automated warehouses to increase the efficiency of material handling during manufacturing, and the entire process was monitored in real time [10]. The French outdoor guide automatic transporter runs at speeds of up to 97 [*]km/h [11]. In the following 10 [*]years, various intelligent automatic transport vehicles have emerged in an endless stream. The automatic transport vehicles based on visual navigation have also been greatly developed. At this time, the typical visual navigation system mainly includes ARCADE system of the University of Michigan; LANA system [12]; NAVLAB system of Carnegie Mellon University, USA; EMS, Vision system of German Federal University of Defense; ROMA system of IITB of Germany; and PVS system of MITI of Japan. According to statistics, by 2004, there were more than 16, 000 automatic transport vehicle systems in use worldwide and more than 100, 000 automatic transport vehicles [13].|$|E

Since efficiency and comfort {{are two of}} the key issues in promoting this kind of transportation system, they are dealt with explicitly in the proposed planning algorithm. To that end, a global path planner has been designed with bounded continuous curvature and bounded curvature derivative to ensure smooth driving. This will allow the public transport system to know a priori which is the shortest path within a selected area that guarantees lateral accelerations and steering wheel speeds below given pre-set thresholds. A closed-form speed profiler uses semantic information provided by the path planner to set a continuous velocity reference that takes into account not only bounds on lateral and longitudinal accelerations consistent with comfort, but also a bound on longitudinal jerk.

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} novel simulation model {{that shows the}} dynamic and complex nature of the innovation system of vehicle automation in a quantitative way. The model looks at the system of automated vehicles from a functional perspective and therefore categorizes vehicle automation into six different levels.

The feedback loops between the components form a dynamic behavior that influences the diffusion of automated vehicles. The model can be used with different datasets and can be enriched with new data in the future.

40|$|In a {{flexible}} manufacturing system, cylinder blocks and heads are processed in batches by four machine in line. Each part is fully processed on one machine only. During batch production the tool magazines contain {{the same set}} of tools. This paper reports on a simulation study to investigate the possibility of reducing the investment in tools by sharing the tools among the machines by means of an <b>automated</b> tool <b>transporting</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The performance of the system is measured by the fraction of time that machines must wait for a tool required for the next imminent operation. These waiting (i. e. idle) times, which characterize the productivity loss, will depend on the selected tool mix, that is the number of tools (< 4) per tool type. The input to the simulation program consists of the process plan, tool lives, tool transport and handling times and the tool mix. Machines may break down due to tool breakages. The transport device carries one tool at a time. Special attention is given to the allocation policy of tools, which plays a central role during real-time operations. Since the process plans are fixed, the times when specific tools are required are known in advance. However, these “events” must be updated continually, due to waiting and breakdown periods. Since the lengths of these periods are not known in advance, updating takes place at the end of such periods. A “look- ahead” policy is defined based on the events. Results show that the system can be operated with considerable less investment in tools while maintaining a small fraction of machine idle times. The reduction in the tool investment out- weighs the extra investment in the tool transport device...|$|R

Kunming Marine Equipment Research Institute successfully developed an automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle</b> based on laser/infrared guidance for the first time. The Intelligent Vehicles Group of Jilin University is mainly engaged in the research of automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles</b> based on visual navigation. It has developed JUTIV 1 and JUTIV 2 visual navigation vehicles. On this basis, they developed the JUTIV 3, general-purpose and assembly-type visual navigation automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles</b> for the actual application of the factory [17].|$|R
