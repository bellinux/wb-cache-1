5|$|Space Travel is {{an early}} video game {{developed}} by Ken Thompson in 1969 that simulates travel in the solar system. The player flies their ship around a two-dimensional scale model {{of the solar system}} with no objectives other than to attempt to land on various planets and moons. The player can move and turn the ship, <b>and</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> overall speed by adjusting the scale of the simulation. The ship is affected by the single strongest gravitational pull of the astronomical bodies.|$|E
5|$|The {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves {{control all}} intrinsic {{muscles of the}} larynx except for the cricothyroid muscle. These muscles act to open, close, <b>and</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> tension of the vocal cords, and include the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles, the only muscle to open the vocal cords. The nerves supply muscles {{on the same side}} of the body, with the exception of the interarytenoid muscle, which is innervated from both sides.|$|E
5|$|Silicon carbide, {{dissolved}} in a {{basic oxygen furnace}} used for making steel, acts as a fuel. The additional energy liberated allows the furnace to process more scrap with the same charge of hot metal. It {{can also be used}} to raise tap temperatures <b>and</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> carbon and silicon content. Silicon carbide is cheaper than a combination of ferrosilicon and carbon, produces cleaner steel and lower emissions due to low levels of trace elements, has a low gas content, and does not lower the temperature of steel.|$|E

5|$|A {{music video}} was issued in November 2003 {{to promote the}} single. The video shows Sebastian on a TV set as it is being {{prepared}} for a show. He is dressed casually in jeans and windcheater. He sits on boxes as he begins to sing with a camera crew starting to film him. An image {{of a young woman}} is shown as he continues. Various personnel walk around him <b>and</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> set. Sebastian stands and the image of the female is seen again, she wears white feathers. Later, Sebastian is dressed more formally in a white suit as he performs the song. On this set are plasma screens depicting the same young woman. The video ends with Sebastian in his casual gear again, sitting on the boxes. The video was produced by Australian Idols Stephen Tate and directed by the show's musical director, John Foreman. On 22 November, the clip was premiered on Network Ten's Video Hits – which had Tate as executive producer.|$|E
5|$|Some {{mainframe}} {{games that}} did not appear in 101 BASIC Computer Games have still had a lasting impact. One such game was Space Travel, developed by Ken Thompson in 1969, which simulates travel in the Solar System. The player flies their ship around a two-dimensional scale model {{of the solar system}} with no objectives other than to attempt to land on various planets and moons. The player can move and turn the ship, <b>and</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> overall speed by adjusting the scale of the simulation. The ship is affected by the single strongest gravitational pull of the astronomical bodies. The game was developed at Bell Labs, and was ported during 1969 from the Multics operating system to the GECOS operating system on the GE 635 computer, and then to the PDP-7 minicomputer. While porting the game to the PDP-7, Thompson developed ideas for his own operating system, which later formed the core of the Unix operating system. Space Travel never spread beyond Bell Labs or had an effect on future games, leaving its primary legacy as part of the original push for the development of Unix.|$|E
5|$|The {{operator}} interface {{provides a means}} for an operator to start and stop the motor <b>and</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> operating speed. Additional operator control functions might include reversing, and switching between manual speed adjustment and automatic control from an external process control signal. The {{operator interface}} often includes an alphanumeric display and/or indication lights and meters {{to provide information about}} the operation of the drive. An operator interface keypad and display unit is often provided {{on the front of the}} VFD controller as shown in the photograph above. The keypad display can often be cable-connected and mounted a short distance from the VFD controller. Most are also provided with input and output (I/O) terminals for connecting push buttons, switches, and other operator interface devices or control signals. A serial communications port is also often available to allow the VFD to be configured, adjusted, monitored, and controlled using a computer.|$|E

5|$|Until World War II, dining at Vassar was {{an elegant}} affair with table linens and serving maids, {{but after the}} war was over, these {{features}} were never brought back to student life. In 1973, the All Campus Dining Center, also called the ACDC or the Deece, opened within the building, serving as a replacement to individual dining rooms {{in each of the}} college's dormitories. The old system had proved too costly and overcrowded, necessitating the ACDC's creation. The $3.5 million renovation was conducted by Walker O. Cain and Associates, with over $1 million of the funds coming from friends and family of Babbott Ladd. An $11 million renovation in 2003 was designed by Finegold Alexander + Associates Inc. Another project, to renovate the kitchen of the Dining Center <b>and</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> locations of the building's bathrooms, is underway as of 2016. The changes, undertaken by LTL Architects, total $8–9 million.|$|E

At the same time, van Gogh had discovered his orphan man, Adrianus Jacobus Zuyderland, who was to become his favourite and most patient model. With the winter drawing in and working outdoors increasingly difficult, van Gogh retreated to his studio and returned to drawing figures. He used the remaining canvas from his work in oils to shutter his windows <b>and</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> light falling on his models.|$|E
25|$|No. 55 Squadron's DH.4s {{arrived in}} France on 6 March 1917 fitted {{with the new}} gear, {{followed}} shortly after by No. 48 squadron's Bristol Fighters and No. 56 Squadron's S.E.5s. Early production models had some teething troubles in service, as ground crew learned to service <b>and</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> new gears, and pilots to operate them. It was late in 1917 before {{a version of the}} gear that could operate twin guns became available, so that the first Sopwith Camels had to be fitted with the Sopwith-Kauper gear instead.|$|E
25|$|The high {{temperature}} water coolant with boric acid dissolved in it is corrosive to carbon steel (but not stainless steel); this can cause radioactive corrosion products to circulate in the primary coolant loop. This not only limits the lifetime of the reactor, but the systems that filter out the corrosion products <b>and</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> boric acid concentration add significantly to the overall cost of the reactor and to radiation exposure. In one instance, this has resulted in severe corrosion to control rod drive mechanisms when the boric acid solution leaked through the seal between the mechanism itself and the primary system.|$|E

25|$|Dry suits pose {{their own}} unique {{problems}} compared to wet suit diving, due to the complex construction and since a diver needs to constantly manage <b>and</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> air volume inside the suit. During descent, air must be added to maintain constant volume. This prevents suit squeeze, loss of neutral buoyancy, and potential uncontrolled descent. During ascent, the air added at depth must be removed again, {{in order to prevent}} over-inflation, excessive buoyancy, and potential uncontrolled ascent. Most modern dry suits are equipped with adjustable spring-loaded automatic exhaust valves, which can assist with this problem when properly set.|$|E
25|$|The owners closely {{watch the}} cricket's {{behavior}} {{for signs of}} discomfort, <b>and</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> diet to bring the fighters into shape. The crickets are mated with females before the fight, as the Chinese believe that, unlike other beings, male crickets become more aggressive after having sex. In Laufer's time the fighters were sorted in three weight classes; present-day Shanghai aficionados have a system of nine classes from 0.51 to 0.74grams. Both sides in a fight should {{belong to the same}} class, thus before the fight the crickets are weighed on high-precision scales (huang). The units of cricket weight, zun and dian, are not used anywhere else.|$|E
25|$|At 1230 {{radio contact}} was re-established with the 3d Platoon. Captain Ulm {{learned that the}} company was in an arc-shaped {{formation}} with the 3d Platoon in the center, 2d on the right, and 1st on the left (north). From this information the airborne observer was better able to picture {{the situation on the ground}} <b>and</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> artillery and air strikes accordingly. As each flight arrived over the target and its ordnance was determined, Captain Ulm was asked to name the desired location. Each time, a colored smoke grenade was thrown by the unit on the ground, and the strike was brought in with relation to the smoke as desired. Ulm noted that much of the automatic weapons and small arms fire came from the trees and that it was extremely accurate, so he ordered his company to concentrate on the well-camouflaged and concealed snipers in the trees.|$|E
