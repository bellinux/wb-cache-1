5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} visual effects, the closing sequence required ADR due to the sound of rain on the original filming. The visual effects were the director Dan Zeff's idea, and the writers were pleased that they were within budget. They also serve to tie the final shot to the opening shot of the episode, as both feature a raven. Scenes that were cut down in the editing process included the initial meeting between the witchfinders—Warren and Clarke—and Sir Andrew Pike, and a private discussion between Warren and Clarke after {{the first day of the}} trial. The extended versions of the scenes featured an explanation about the Devil being found in everyday objects and <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> stages of torture respectively. Shearsmith expressed frustration that these extra scenes could not be included on the DVD release.|$|E
5|$|On 3 November 2006, Litvinenko (under {{the name}} of Edwin Carter) was {{admitted}} for further investigation at Barnet General Hospital, London. After being moved from his local hospital in north London to University College Hospital in central London for intensive care, his blood and urine samples {{were sent to the}} UK's Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) for testing. Scientists at AWE tested for radioactive poison using gamma spectroscopy. No gamma rays were detected; however, a small spike was noticed at an energy of 803 kilo-electron volts (keV). The BBC reported that by coincidence another scientist, who had worked on Britain's early atomic bomb programme decades before, happened to overhear <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> small spike and recognised it as the gamma ray signal from polonium-210, which was a critical component of early nuclear bombs. On the evening of 22 November, shortly before his death, his doctors were informed the poison was likely to be polonium-210. Further tests on a larger urine sample using spectroscopy designed to detect alpha radiation confirmed the result the following day.|$|E

25|$|When {{from the}} 19th century in Russia there was <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{authenticity}} of four-part Court chant settings, compared to earlier Russian traditions, Bach's four-part Chorale settings, {{such as those}} ending his Chorale cantatas, were considered as foreign-influenced models: such influence was, however, deemed unavoidable.|$|E

50|$|<b>As</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> series {{continued}} <b>a</b> further {{theme was}} developed: that what people believe <b>about</b> <b>the</b> workings of markets and their relationships {{to the state}} shapes history through the laws that are enacted or discarded. It was therefore decided that the treatment of these themes would loosely fall into two parts, ideas followed by their consequences.|$|R
25|$|Cruz was {{initially}} {{expected to play}} the lead role, but dropped out when the filming schedule of another project was changed. Von Trier then offered the role to Kirsten Dunst, who accepted it. Dunst had been suggested for the role by the American filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson in <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> film between him and von Trier.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} change after 2000 was the {{increasing use of}} empirical studies in order to evaluate algorithms. This development took place due to the emergence of transparent corpora. Although there are still discussions about what the best evaluation metrics are, the use of experimental evaluation has already led to a better comparability of algorithms, <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> goals of REG and more task-oriented research.|$|E
25|$|The {{linguistic}} term Cumbric {{is defined}} according to geographical rather than linguistic criteria: that is, {{it refers to}} the variety of Brittonic spoken within a particular region of North Britain and implies nothing about that variety except that it was geographically distinct from other varieties. This has led to <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> nature of Cumbric and its relationship with other Brittonic languages, in particular with Old Welsh.|$|E

25|$|Many of {{the people}} who were born in Karelia and were {{evacuated}} want Karelia to become part of Finland. According to polls, older people (ages 65 and up) and young people (15-25) support the idea more strongly than the generation of their parents (25–65) who grew up during the Cold War. Former President Mauno Koivisto has been against <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> question. Support for regaining the ceded areas is also strong among minor nationalist right-wing groups.|$|E
25|$|This {{leads into}} <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{merits of the}} debate whether the {{universe}} is eternal or created. As in the first book, Aristotle's theory of the eternity {{of the universe is}} seen as the best, philosophically. However, this is because Maimonides considered the proofs that the universe was created to be inferior. He still points out supposed problems with the Aristotelian view and states that, while Aristotle's argument is the best, the possession of Divine Revelation from the Torah is the extra piece of information necessary to decide the matter.|$|E
25|$|During <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{potential}} {{plot of the}} game's sequel BioShock 2, editor Hilary Goldstein {{said that}} Ryan should reappear in it, and that while {{it should be in}} a new area, it should still have connections to him. Onyett called Ryan a key element, and if not included in the sequel, there would be a dramatic loss of personality. He claimed that much of Rapture's personality comes from Ryan, and it would have much less of an impact without him. Editor Ryan Geddes agreed, adding that he felt there was more to Ryan than Rapture. Editor Nate Ahem suggested that the game's sequel, BioShock 2, could potentially put the players in the role of Ryan, to explore the story of trying to create a perfect world and having it crumble beneath their feet.|$|E

When critics noted that the very name of the SNAP program shows that {{it is intended to}} [...] "supplement" [...] an individual's food budget, not be its sole source, Booker replied that his aim was to spark <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> reality that many Americans rely solely on food stamps to survive.|$|E
500|$|Tomlinson's death sparked <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{nature of}} Britain's {{policing}} {{and the relationship}} between the police, public, media and IPCC. The mayor of London, Boris Johnson, dismissed the criticism of the police as [...] "an orgy of cop bashing." [...] The death was compared to others that had acted as a watershed in the public's perception of policing, including that of Blair Peach (1979), Stephen Lawrence (1993) and Jean Charles de Menezes (2005). The IPCC was criticized for having taken seven days from Tomlinson's death, and five days after hearing evidence that police may have been involved, to remove the City of London police from the investigation.|$|E

[...] In 2012, he praised Senator John McCain's leadership in defending Huma Abedin against anti-Muslim attacks. Affleck engaged in <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> relationship between liberal principles and Islam during a 2014 appearance on Real Time with Bill Maher. In a 2017 Guardian interview, he said: [...] "I strongly believe {{that no one should}} be stereotyped {{on the basis of their}} race or religion.

500|$|In <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> book in Slate magazine, John Horgan was {{particularly}} moved by Gladwell's family history. He {{felt that the}} links between race and achievement were given substantive analysis, but found the lessons mentioned in Outliers to be [...] "oddly anticlimactic, even dispiriting". His contribution concluded by remarking, [...] "Outliers represents a squandered opportunity for Gladwell—himself an outlier, an enormously talented and influential writer and the descendant of an African slave—to make a major contribution to our ongoing discourse about nature, nurture, and race." [...] BusinessWeek gave the book {{four out of five}} stars and appreciated its [...] "Aha!" [...] moments, but wondered if Gladwell purposely omits evidence that contradicts his thesis. The review remarked that Outliers was repetitive in parts, but that Gladwell eventually pulls the stories together into an overarching narrative.|$|E
500|$|In August 2011, Starkey {{appeared}} as a guest on the BBC's Newsnight programme together with Owen Jones and Dreda Say Mitchell, made during <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> 2011 England riots. Starkey claimed that [...] "the whites have become black", and that [...] "a particular sort of violent, destructive, nihilistic, gangster culture has become the fashion". The leader of the Labour party, Ed Miliband, spoke about Starkey's remarks, saying [...] "they are racist comments, frankly". The author Toby Young, blogging in the Telegraph, defended Starkey by claiming that Starkey had been talking not about black culture in general. Rod Liddle argued {{in support of the}} remarks. Fellow panellist Owen Jones described the comments as [...] "one of the ugliest episodes of the backlash", claiming that [...] "multiculturalism and ethnic groups {{have nothing to do with}} what happened".|$|E
