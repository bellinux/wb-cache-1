5|$|At La Brea, predatory {{birds and}} mammals were {{attracted}} to dead or dying herbivores that had become mired, and then these predators became trapped themselves. Herbivore entrapment was estimated to have occurred once every fifty years, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>every</b> instance of herbivore remains found in the pits there were an estimated ten carnivores. C.d.guildayi {{is the most common}} carnivoran found at LaBrea, followed by Smilodon. Remains of dire wolves outnumber remains of gray wolves in the tar pits by a ratio of five to one. During the Last Glacial Maximum, coastal California, with a climate slightly cooler and wetter than today, is thought to have been a refuge, and a comparison of the frequency of dire wolves and other predator remains at LaBrea to other parts of California and North America indicates significantly greater abundances; therefore, the higher dire wolf numbers in the LaBrea region did not reflect the wider area. Assuming that {{only a few of the}} carnivores that were feeding became trapped, it is likely that fairly sizeable groups of dire wolves fed together on these occasions.|$|E

25|$|Cochrane {{investigation}} {{found that the}} use of antibiotics either just before or just after surgery reduced the risk of infection, pain and dry socket after wisdom teeth are removed by oral surgeons, but that using antibiotics also causes more side effects for these patients.
