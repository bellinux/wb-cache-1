5|$|Fueled {{by events}} such as the Waco Siege in 1993, the murders and suicides {{associated}} with the Order of the Solar Temple, and the 1995 Aum Shinrikyo incidents in Japan, German fears and concerns about new religious movements gained in intensity in the 1990s, with Scientology attracting particular attention. Perceptions that Scientology had <b>a</b> <b>totalitarian</b> character were reinforced when Robert Vaughn Young, an American ex-Scientologist and former PR official in the Church of Scientology, visited German officials in late 1995 and wrote an article in Der Spiegel, a widely read weekly magazine, describing Scientology as <b>a</b> <b>totalitarian</b> system operating a gulag – the Rehabilitation Project Force – for members of Scientology's Sea Org found guilty of transgressions. From the mid-1990s onward, press articles, reports and essays on Scientology appeared on an almost daily basis, accompanied by books and television programmes that reached a mass audience.|$|E
5|$|Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri is a 1996 {{tactical}} first-person shooter {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Looking Glass Technologies.

40|$|The article {{attempts}} to study whether the Chinese Empire {{at the time}} of the Sui Dynasty could be considered <b>an</b> early <b>totalitarian</b> state or not. The analysis, based on historical data, proceeds from a scheme of <b>an</b> early <b>totalitarian</b> state devised by the author and reveals that the Sui state does have the characteristics of an early totalitarianstate with regard to historical-political reasons and foreign policy related factors, and, to a great extent, in administration and economy, whereas the relevant characteristics are indirectly or very slightly explicit in the field of social life. The features of early totalitarianism, within the governance method of the Sui state, aregenerally not evident with regard to legal order and ideology. In conclusion, it is highly probable that the Sui Empire corresponds to <b>an</b> early <b>totalitarian</b> governing system,bearing in mind the external characteristics of state power, not the internal ones. This is a relevant and fundamental difference between the Chinese Qin Empire (221 – 207 BC), as <b>a</b> purely early <b>totalitarian</b> state, and the Sui Empire as <b>an</b> emerging early <b>totalitarian</b> state. Thus, the Sui Empire was probably becoming an early totalitarianstate, however, this process was discontinued due to the perishing of the dynasty...|$|R
5|$|The book {{attracted}} academic interest, {{and scholars}} discussed it {{in at least}} three distinct categories: language and style, often in relation to the politics of totalitarianism; trauma studies, given the psychological pressure on the novel's characters, who grow up under <b>a</b> <b>totalitarian</b> regime; and ethnographic and literary studies of the German minority in Romania. On the latter topic, Valentina Glajar, now at Texas State University, published an article in 1997. Müller's Herztier is one of the four titles discussed in Glajar's 2004 monograph The German Legacy, on German-language literature from Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Unrest {{then broke}} out across eastern Bolivia, as radicalized autonomist activists {{established}} blockades, occupied airports, clashing with pro-government demonstrations, police, and armed forces. Some formed paramilitaries, bombing state companies, indigenous NGOs, {{and human rights}} organisations, also launching armed racist attacks on indigenous communities, culminating in the Pando Massacre of MAS activists. The autonomists gained support from some high-ranking politicians; Santa Cruz Governor Rubén Costas lambasted Morales and his supporters with racist epithets, accusing the president of being an Aymara fundamentalist and <b>a</b> <b>totalitarian</b> dictator responsible for state terrorism. Amid the unrest, foreign commentators began speculating {{on the possibility of}} civil war.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of {{the number}} of Serbs killed on 11–13 May vary. Historians Jozo Tomasevich and Ivo Goldstein put the number at 260. Historians Sabrina P. Ramet and Marko Attila Hoare {{estimate}} that about 300 Serbs were massacred while historian Davide Rodogno puts the number at 417 killed. On 14 May, the Archbishop of Zagreb, Aloysius Stepinac, sent a letter of protest to Pavelić after receiving news of the killings. He failed to condemn the atrocity publicly. The next day, Pavelić visited Rome and was granted a private audience with Pope Pius XII, who offered de facto recognition of the NDH on behalf of the Holy See. Although he was aware that Pavelić was <b>a</b> <b>totalitarian</b> dictator, {{there is no evidence that}} he had knowledge of the first Glina massacre at the time.|$|E

5000|$|There is <b>an</b> <b>totalitarian</b> {{aspect to}} the Movement. Dirlik sees the {{movement}} as a [...] "modern counterrevolution" [...] opposed to an [...] "anti-revolutionary conservatism" [...] {{due to the fact}} that it instrumentalised traditional moral codes and societal constructs. Other historians regard this movement as imitating German Fascism and being a neo-nationalistic movement used to elevate Chiang's control of everyday lives. Frederic Wakeman suggested that the New Life Movement was [...] "Confucian fascism".|$|R
5|$|From October to November 1944, the Yugoslav Partisans, {{supported}} {{by both the}} Western Allies and the Soviet Union, and assisted {{by the forces of}} the Bulgarian Fatherland Front and two brigades of Albanian partisans, retook the region of Kosovo as the Germans withdrew. The area was reincorporated into the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. With no chance of victory, the withdrawing Germans helped Albanian collaborators escape the country as the communists drew closer. Many failed to escape and were executed by the communists upon capture. On 28 November 1944, the communist forces of Enver Hoxha emerged victorious in Albania. Hoxha subsequently implemented <b>a</b> <b>totalitarian</b> Stalinist government which banned all religions in the country.|$|E
5|$|Ghost {{takes place}} in the fictional {{universe}} of the StarCraft series. The series is set in a distant part of the galaxy called the Koprulu Sector and begins in the year 2499. Terran exiles from Earth are governed by <b>a</b> <b>totalitarian</b> empire, the Terran Dominion, that is opposed by several smaller rebel groups. Two alien races discover humanity: the insectoid Zerg, who begin to invade planets controlled by the Terrans; and the Protoss, an enigmatic race with strong psionic power that attempt to eradicate the Zerg. Ghost takes place four years after the conclusion of , in which the Zerg become the dominant power in the sector and leave both the Protoss and the Dominion in ruins. The game follows the story of Nova, a young ghost agent—a human espionage operative with psychic abilities—in the employ of the Dominion.|$|E
5|$|The federal {{government}} took direct {{aim at the}} U.S. Communist party in 1948 when it indicted its top twelve leaders in the Foley Square trial. The case hinged {{on whether or not}} mere membership in <b>a</b> <b>totalitarian</b> political party was sufficient to conclude that members advocated the overthrow of the United States government. The ACLU chose to not represent any of the defendants, and they were all found guilty and sentenced to three to five years in prison. Their defense attorneys were all cited for contempt, went to prison and were disbarred. When the government indicted additional party members, the defendants could not find attorneys to represent them. Communists protested outside the courthouse; a bill to outlaw picketing of courthouses was introduced in Congress, and the ACLU supported the anti-picketing law.|$|E

5|$|According to Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, {{the themes}} of {{alienation}} and persecution, although present in Kafka's work, have been over-emphasised by critics. They argue Kafka's work is more deliberate and subversive—and more joyful—than may first appear. They point out that reading the Kafka work while focusing on the futility of his characters' struggles reveals Kafka's play of humour; he is not necessarily commenting on his own problems, but rather pointing out how people tend to invent problems. In his work, Kafka often created malevolent, absurd worlds. Kafka read drafts of his works to his friends, typically concentrating on his humorous prose. The writer Milan Kundera suggests that Kafka's surrealist humour {{may have been an}} inversion of Dostoyevsky's presentation of characters who are punished for a crime. In Kafka's work a character is punished although a crime has not been committed. Kundera believes that Kafka's inspirations for his characteristic situations came both from growing up in a patriarchal family and living in <b>a</b> <b>totalitarian</b> state.|$|E
5|$|To {{celebrate}} Hitler's {{appointment as}} chancellor, Goebbels organized a torchlit parade in Berlin {{on the night}} of 30 January of an estimated 60,000 men, many in the uniforms of the SA and SS. The spectacle was covered by a live state radio broadcast, with commentary by longtime party member and future Minister of Aviation Hermann Göring. Goebbels was disappointed to not be given a post in Hitler's new cabinet. Bernhard Rust was appointed as Minister of Culture, the post Goebbels was expecting to receive. Like other NSDAP officials, Goebbels had to deal with Hitler's leadership style of giving contradictory orders to his subordinates, while placing them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped. In this way, Hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power. The NSDAP took advantage of the Reichstag fire of 27 February 1933, with Hindenburg passing the Reichstag Fire Decree the following day at Hitler's urging. This was the first of several pieces of legislation that dismantled democracy in Germany and put <b>a</b> <b>totalitarian</b> dictatorship—headed by Hitler—in its place. On 5 March, yet another Reichstag election took place, the last to be held before the defeat of the Nazis {{at the end of the}} Second World War. While the NSDAP increased their number of seats and percentage of the vote, it was not the landslide expected by the party leadership. Goebbels finally received Hitler's appointment to the cabinet, officially becoming head of the newly created Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda on 14 March.|$|E
