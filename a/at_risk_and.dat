5|$|To reach {{all points}} {{designated}} by the Admiralty for longitude measurements, it was sometimes necessary to take chronometers ashore, across inlets and up rivers too shallow for the ship. This put the chronometers <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> the disturbance of moving them affected their accuracy. This was another reason for survey ships to carry a large number – most {{of them could be}} kept permanently in a safe, well-cushioned place on the main vessel.|$|E

5|$|Atlantic puffins are {{probably}} safest when out at sea. Here, the dangers are often from below the water rather than above, and puffins {{can sometimes be}} seen putting their heads underwater to peer around for predators. Seals {{have been known to}} kill puffins and large fish may also do so. Most puffin colonies are on small islands, and this is no coincidence as it avoids predation by ground-based mammals such as foxes, rats, stoats and weasels, cats and dogs. When they come ashore, the birds are still <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> the main threats come from the sky.|$|E
5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman is {{considered}} to be a keystone species whose presence in the ecosystem maintains a healthy balance of organisms. In its absence, fish, such as piranhas, might dominate the environment. The eggs and newly hatched young of Cuvier's dwarf caiman are most <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> are preyed on by birds, snakes, rats, raccoons and other mammals. Adult caimans are protected by the bony osteoderms under the scales and their main predators are jaguars, green anacondas (Eunectes murinus) and large boa constrictors (Boa constrictor).|$|E
5|$|The 400-page report made 108 {{recommendations}} in child protection reform. Regional and local committees {{for children and}} families are to be set up, with members from all groups involved in child protection. Previously each local authority managed their own child protection register, a list of children believed to be <b>at</b> <b>risk,</b> <b>and</b> no national register existed; this, combined with local authorities' tendency to suppress information about child abuse cases, led to the implementation of the child database. Two organisations to improve the care of children, the General Social Care Council and the Social Care Institute for Excellence, had already been set up by the time the report was published.|$|E

25|$|The {{need for}} this {{definition}} of Gibraltarian was rooted in the epidemic of 1804, where control of population density {{was seen as a}} major consideration.
