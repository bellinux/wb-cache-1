40|$|As {{the demand}} for {{wireless}} communication grows, {{it is critical to}} search for techniques to efficiently exploit the limited bandwidth and discriminate between the users. CDMA {{has been found to be}} a promising multiple-access technique to mitigate fading and to provide efficient use of bandwidth. Unlike FDMA and TDMA, which are band-limited, CDMA is interference-limited. Therefore, for a CDMA system designer, one major objective is to eliminate interference of the desired signal. Multiuser detection exploits the structure of the multiuser interference in order to increase the efficiency and eliminate the effect of MAI (Multi-Access Interference). Included in the various multiuser detection schemes are the interference cancellation receivers; those are the simplest to implement. As the number of users in a system with limited bandwidth grows, it becomes necessary to assign signature waveforms which have relatively larger correlations. This motivates the use of multiple antennas at the receiver to provide increased discrimination between the users by exploiting their spatial separation. In addition, beamforming as well as diversity combining techniques can be used to reduce multiple access interference arriving from directions other than that of the desired user. Due to the dynamic nature of cellular communications and severe fading conditions, the <b>array</b> <b>response</b> <b>vectors</b> vary rapidly, making it impossible for the receiver to know their exact values at a given time. Therefore, it is desirable for a multiple antenna receiver to be able to detect and follow the <b>array</b> <b>response</b> <b>vectors</b> blindly in an adaptive fashion. The focus of this thesis is blind space-time multiuser detection schemes for DS/CDMA communication systems. Different types of interference cancelling receivers are presented and compared. Several adaptive algorithms in CDMA environments are proposed. The performance on convergence rate, and the steady state beam pattern of these schemes, are also investigated and compared. The interference cancelation scheme is then combined with smart antennas. A serial interference cancelling scheme with multiple receiving antennas is formulated and potential enhancement in performance when using antenna arrays is demonstrated. The antenna arrays are either correlated or independent. It is shown that without requiring any additional spatial information, this receiver achieves better error performance than its single-element counterpart. These schemes are then extended to provide multipath diversity by constructively combining the replicas of the desired signal arriving from different directions and delays. By exploiting the Two Dimensional RAKE (2 D-RAKE) receiver, the performance improves dramatically...|$|R

Contributions of this paper include 1) ADC bit-allocation algorithms to improve communication performance of a hybrid MIMO receiver, 2) approximation of the capacity with the BA algorithm {{as a function of}} channels, and 3) a worst-case analysis of the ergodic rate of the proposed MIMO receiver that quantifies system tradeoffs and serves as the lower bound.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the use of diversely polarized antennas in an array system as the advantage of this array architecture over a uniformly polarized array is its capability to separate multiple signals based on their polarization characteristics. Overall system performance is substantially improved due to an extra degree of signal discrimination. In this thesis, the aim is to address and explore several issues regarding the employment of the diversely polarized antennas in order to assess the array performance and its characteristics. First of all, the geometrical properties of the array manifold associated with polarization-sensitive array are explored from the differential geometry perspective. The fact that the array manifold incorporates all information about the array and signal environments allows it to completely characterize the whole system. In this work, a new mathematical framework is proposed to analyze three- parameter diversely polarized manifold, where important notations to describe the local characteristics of the manifold are provided. Second, issues regarding the presence of uncertainties in polarization-sensitive arrays are investigated. The array system considered so far is assumed to be free from errors and uncertainties. However, in practice, the system performance is affected considerably by various types of uncertainties that deviate from the assumed conditions. A framework based on the sensitivity analysis of manifold shape property is presented to evaluate the array robustness to uncertainties. In addition, a novel calibration method is proposed utilizing the concept of diversely polarized manifold. Third, problems regarding the presence of manifold ambiguities are addressed. Manifold ambiguity is an undesirable situation often encountered when there exists linear dependence amongst <b>array</b> <b>response</b> <b>vectors.</b> This study aims to investigate issues regarding the identification, classification, as well as the eradication of some types of ambiguities. A general framework to identify diversely polarized manifold ambiguity is presented, followed by two novel techniques to resolve ambiguities. Finally, issues regarding the use of polarization-sensitive antennas in CDMA- based systems are addressed. The framework is essentially based on an integration of polarization-sensitive antennas, space-time array processing, and the spread-spectrum multiple access technology. First, the properties of Polarization- Spatio-Temporal ARray (Polar-STAR) manifold is investigated based on a direct relationship with the diversely polarized manifold.
