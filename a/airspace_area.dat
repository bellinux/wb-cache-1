Here we test the hypothesis whether systemic administration of acrolein could cause endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and lung cell apoptosis, leading to the enlargement of the alveolar air spaces in rats. Methods: Acute and chronic effects of intraperitoneally administered acrolein were tested. Mean alveolar <b>airspace</b> <b>area</b> was measured by using light microscopy and imaging system software. TUNEL staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for active caspase 3 and Western blot analysis for active caspase 3, and caspase 12 were performed to detect apoptosis.

40|$|Sphingolipids {{play a role}} in the {{development}} of emphysema and ceramide levels are increased in experimental models of emphysema; however, the mechanisms of ceramide-related pulmonary emphysema are not fully understood. Here we examine mechanisms of ceramide-induced pulmonary emphysema. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with fenretinide (20 mg/kg BW), a synthetic derivative of retinoic acid that causes the formation of ceramide, and we postulated that the effects of fenretinide could be offset by administering sphingosine 1 -phosphate (S 1 P) (100 µg/kg BW). Lung tissues were analyzed and mean alveolar <b>airspace</b> <b>area,</b> total length of the alveolar perimeter and the number of caspase- 3 positive cells were measured. Hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF- 1 α), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other related proteins were analyzed by Western blot analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis of HIF- 1 α was also performed. Ceramide, dihydroceramide, S 1 P, and dihydro-S 1 P were measured by mass spectrometer. Chronic intraperitoneal injection of fenretinide increased the alveolar airspace surface area and increased the number of caspase- 3 positive cells in rat lungs. Fenretinide also suppressed HIF- 1 α and VEGF protein expression in rat lungs. Concomitant injection of S 1 P prevented the decrease in the expression of HIF- 1 α, VEGF, histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC 2), and nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) -like 2 (Nrf 2) protein expression in the lungs. S 1 P injection also increased phosphorylated sphingosine kinase 1. Dihydroceramide was significantly increased by fenretinide injection and S 1 P treatment prevented the increase in dihydroceramide levels in rat lungs. These data support the concept that increased de novo ceramide production causes alveolar septal cell apoptosis and causes emphysema via suppressing HIF- 1 α. Concomitant treatment with S 1 P normalizes the ceramide-S 1 P balance in the rat lungs and increases HIF- 1 α protein expression via activation of sphingosine kinase 1; as a consequence, S 1 P salvages fenretinide induced emphysema in rat lungs...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Studies of the {{relation}} between the severity of structural change in emphysema and physiological abnormality have been based on macroscopic assessments, which have not been truly quantitative or sensitive enough to detect early changes. With a highly reproducible method for measuring emphysema using histological sections and a semiautomatic image analysis system, this quantitative assessment of emphysema was compared with a semiquantitative macroscopic assessment of emphysema and measurements of carbon monoxide gas transfer. METHODS: Microscopic and macroscopic measurements of emphysema on 44 thoracotomy specimens were compared; only two were from non-smokers. <b>Airspace</b> wall surface <b>area</b> per unit volume was measured microscopically with an automatic image analyser and expressed as both the mean <b>airspace</b> wall surface <b>area</b> per unit volume and the mean value of the five fields with the lowest values. Macroscopic emphysema was measured directly on a tracing of the midsagittal slice using a digitising tablet attached to a microcomputer and expressed {{as a percentage of the}} total area of lung. In cases with centriacinar emphysema the number of discrete lesions was counted. RESULTS: The area of macroscopic emphysema ranged from 0 to 78 % of the total area of lung examined, but most patients had less than 1 % involvement so that the distribution was highly skewed. Both mean <b>airspace</b> wall surface <b>area</b> per unit volume and the mean of five fields with the lowest <b>airspace</b> wall surface <b>area</b> per unit volume were normally distributed, with mean <b>airspace</b> <b>areas</b> ranging from 8. 8 to 25. 4 mm 2 /mm 3 (mean 18. 1 mm 2 /mm 3). In lobes with centriacinar emphysema the number of discrete lesions correlated with <b>airspace</b> wall surface <b>area</b> per unit volume and with preoperative carbon monoxide transfer factor (TLCO) per unit lung volume. However, other measurements of macroscopic emphysema did not correlate with loss of alveolar wall surface area, and there was considerable overlap between subjects with no or minimal macroscopic emphysema and those with more severe disease. TLCO correlated with both mean <b>airspace</b> wall surface <b>area</b> per unit volume and the mean of five fields with the lowest <b>airspace</b> wall surface <b>area</b> per unit volume but not with the severity of macroscopic emphysema. CONCLUSION: If emphysema is to be quantified it must be measured microscopically; macroscopic measurements do not, in general, reflect the microscopic loss of airspace wall...|$|R

40|$|Infants born to {{diabetic}} or obese {{mothers are}} at risk of respiratory distress and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), conceivably through fuel-mediated pathogenic mechanisms. Prior research and preventative measures focus on controlling maternal hyperglycemia, but growing evidence suggests a role for additional circulating fuels including lipids. Little is known about the individual or additive effects of a maternal high-fat diet on fetal lung development. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effects of a maternal high-fat diet, alone and alongside late-gestation diabetes, on lung alveologenesis and vasculogenesis, as well as to ascertain if consequences persist beyond the perinatal period. A rat model was used to study lung development in offspring from control, diabetes-exposed, high-fat diet-exposed and combination-exposed pregnancies via morphometric, histologic (alveolarization and vasculogenesis) and physiologic (echocardiography, pulmonary function) analyses at birth and 3 weeks of age. Outcomes were interrogated for diet, diabetes and interaction effect using ANOVA with significance set at p≤ 0. 05. Findings prompted additional mechanistic inquiry of key molecular pathways. Offspring exposed to maternal diabetes or high-fat diet, alone and in combination, had smaller lungs and larger hearts at birth. High-fat diet-exposed, but not diabetes-exposed offspring, had a higher perinatal death rate and echocardiographic evidence of PPHN at birth. Alveolar mean linear intercept, septal thickness, and <b>airspace</b> <b>area</b> (D 2) were not significantly different between the groups; however, markers of lung maturity were. Both diabetes-exposed and diet-exposed offspring expressed more T 1 α protein, a marker of type I cells. Diet-exposed newborn pups expressed less surfactant protein B and had fewer pulmonary vessels enumerated. Mechanistic inquiry revealed alterations in AKT activation, higher endothelin- 1 expression, and an impaired Txnip/VEGF pathway that are important for vessel growth and migration. After 3 weeks, mortality remained highest and static lung compliance and hysteresis were lowest in combination-exposed offspring. This study emphasizes the effects of a maternal high-fat diet, especially alongside late-gestation diabetes, on pulmonary vasculogenesis, demonstrates adverse consequences beyond the perinatal period and directs attention to mechanistic pathways of interest. Findings provide a foundation for additional investigation of preventative and therapeutic strategies aimed at decreasing pulmonary morbidity in at-risk infants...|$|E
40|$|A {{paradigm}} shift {{is at hand}} with the planned redesign of the Air Traffic Management and Air Traffic Control systems. The concept for the future air traffic system foresees that aircraft will monitor and maintain separation to each other by themselves in Autonomous Operations Area airspace. With this shift of responsibility for separation assurance from Air Traffic Control to the flight deck crews a more flexible and better airspace usage is expected. Furthermore, through the more flexible airspace usage, a gain in flight efficiency is also anticipated. In order to operate in this <b>airspace</b> <b>area,</b> aircraft are required to be equipped with a system enabling them to detect and resolve air traffic conflicts. Upon detection of a conflict with another aircraft, the system is expected to compute an alternative trajectory which guides the aircraft around the conflict and back to its original trajectory. The alternative trajectory needs to adhere to several requirements, such as being clear of conflicts and being flyable. Further requirements that are often stated are to minimise the additional fuel and time required for the resolution. This thesis is concerned with such a Conflict Detection & Resolution system. Primary focus lies on the resolution of air traffic conflicts while guaranteeing flyability and respecting the Cost Index. The Cost Index is nowadays used by the Flight Management System to optimise the flight profile in respect to the operators prioritisation of fuel-related to time-related costs. This paramter is included into the Conflict Resolution process {{which is based on}} Artificial Force Fields. Flyability of the trajectory is intended to be guaranteed through integration of a flight mechanics model. The algorithm devised in this work is validated in fast time simulations with varying Cost Index. Objects of study are the distance at the Closest Point of Approach, the integration of the Cost Index and the flyability of the resulting trajectory. The first two objects of this study will be validated through comparison of the original and updated trajectory. The new trajectory is considered conflict free if the distance at the Closest Point of Approach is sufficiently large. The lateral, vertical and temporal differences between the two trajectories are used as measures for time- and fuel-related costs. Flyability of the resulting trajectory is validated by confirming adherence to the flight envelope and the constraints given by the flight mechanics model used. The evaluation of the algorithm showed that by integration of a flight mechanics model flyability of the resulting trajectory could be assured. Regarding resolution of the conflicts, the algorithm could compute a trajectory which prevented the initially set up Mid-Air Collision between the aircraft. Though, the minimum required separation could not be achieved in all cases. The approach of integrating the Cost Index into the resolution process showed to be feasible, whereas especially regarding the speed resolution further enhancements {{have been found to be}} necessary...|$|E
