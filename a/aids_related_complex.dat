At an October 2, 1990, protest to raise attention for McGovern’s lawsuit, two hundred ACT UP protestors gathered in Washington and chanted “How many more have to die before you say they qualify,” and carried posters to the rally with the tagline “Women Don’t Get AIDS/ They Just Die From It.” The CDC’s initial reaction to calls of the revising the AIDS definition included setting the threshold of AIDS {{for both men and women}} at a T cell count of under 200. However, McGovern dismissed this suggestion. “Lots of women who show up at hospitals don’t get T cells taken. No one knows they have HIV. I knew how many of our clients were dying of AIDS and not counted.” Rather, McGovern, along with the ACLU and the New Jersey Women and AIDS Network, called for adding fifteen conditions to the list of the CDC’s surveillance case definition, which was eventually adopted in January 1993. Six months later, the Clinton administration revised federal criteria for evaluating HIV status and making it easier for women with AIDS to secure Social Security benefits. The Women’s Caucus’ role in altering the CDC’s definition helped to not only drastically increase availability of federal benefits to American women, but helped uncover a more accurate number of HIV/AIDS infected women in the United States; “under the new model, the number of women with AIDS in the United States increased almost 50 percent.” ...|$|E

Patients with the <b>AIDS</b> <b>related</b> <b>complex,</b> non-pulmonary Kaposi sarcoma, and non-pulmonary non-Kaposi sarcoma AIDS (that is, opportunist infections affecting other organs) had lower mean values for TLCO (77 %, 70 %, and 70 % of predicted respectively).

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} whether early effects of zidovudine treatment on CD 4 + lymphocyte count and concentrations of beta 2 microglobulin, neopterin, or HIV p 24 antigen or antibody are correlated with survival {{in patients with}} AIDS or <b>AIDS</b> <b>related</b> <b>complex.</b> DESIGN [...] Retrospective study of changes in laboratory markers and survival. SETTING [...] Multicentre trial at university hospital clinics. SUBJECTS [...] 90 Patients with AIDS or <b>AIDS</b> <b>related</b> <b>complex.</b> INTERVENTION [...] Patients started zidovudine 200 mg orally every four hours. Fifty six of the patients died a median 17 months after starting zidovudine; the remaining 34 patients were followed up for a median 25. 5 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Changes in CD 4 + lymphocyte count and serum concentrations of p 24 antigen and antibody, beta 2 microglobulin, and neopterin; survival of the patient. RESULTS [...] The pretreatment characteristics that independently predicted poor survival were determined using a multivariate proportional hazards model: a diagnosis of AIDS (v <b>AIDS</b> <b>related</b> <b>complex),</b> age over 45 years, and the logarithm of serum neopterin concentration. When these baseline characteristics were controlled for the logarithm of CD 4 + lymphocyte count at weeks 8 - 12 of treatment (p = 0. 007) {{and an increase in}} serum beta 2 microglobulin concentration at weeks 8 - 12 (p = 0. 05) also independently correlated with survival. In the 38 patients with a better pretreatment prognosis, 24 month survival estimated by the product-limit method was 88 % for those with a good response on both surrogate markers during early treatment compared with only 50 % for those with a poor response on either marker. In the 38 with a worse pretreatment prognosis, 24 month survival was estimated to be 49 % for those with a good response on both surrogate markers compared with only 18 % for those with a poor response on either. CONCLUSION [...] These data suggest that CD 4 + lymphocyte count at 8 - 12 weeks and, perhaps, change in serum beta 2 microglobulin concentration could be surrogate end points for clinical outcome in trials of antiretroviral drugs for patients with HIV disease...|$|E

One or more infective agents was found in eight of 11 patients with severe acute pneumonia and in 26 of 62 patients with interstitial pneumonitis. In interstitial pneumonitis, the most frequently encountered agents were Pneumocystis carinii (12), cytomegalovirus (8), and Aspergillus fumigatus (3).

The increasing prevalence of HIV infection in children, associated with immune deficiency, has led to concern about the efficacy and complications of immunisation among these children. 1 2 The problem of whether children infected with HIV should receive live vaccines is complex: the risk of vaccina-tion must be balanced against the risk of infection in the non-vaccinated child...|$|E
