5|$|The next {{vignette}} {{focuses on}} Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) {{as she tries}} to create the perfect sandwich using bizarre science. After exhausting herself going to extreme <b>and</b> <b>ridiculous</b> lengths to produce and combine all the ingredients perfectly, she offers the sandwich to Cinnamon Bun (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker), who merely shoves it into his pastry body and belches foodstuff onto the princess. The action then shifts to the Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), who smells a stench in his ice castle. After mistakenly assuming that the smell was being caused by Gunter the penguin's flatulence, the Ice King realizes that his armpits are actually the source of the smell. After taking a shower, he ponders aloud as to how he got so smelly. Gunter then proceeds to flatulate underneath his arms.|$|E
5|$|Hogarth {{exhibited}} the painting at the Society of Artists in Spring Gardens in 1761. Although press reports – perhaps placed by Hogarth {{and his supporters}} – were enthusiastic, Sigismunda mourning over the Heart of Guiscardo was attacked by critics who marked Hogarth's attempt to emulate the drama depicted in older Italian paintings as foolhardy <b>and</b> <b>ridiculous.</b> Many critics were repulsed by the shocking contrast between the melancholy beauty of Sigismunda and the grotesquely bloody organ that she delicately touched. It was said that Hogarth placed an attendant next to the painting to note the remarks made by the viewers; changes to the painting suggest {{that he may have}} responded to these criticisms by altering his work, although it is impossible to ascertain whether many of the changes were made before or after the painting was exhibited.|$|E

25|$|The {{figure of}} Bertoldo/Berthold, a humble and clever farmer from Retorbido, who lived {{during the reign}} of Alboin (568-572), {{inspired}} many oral traditions throughout the Middle Ages and early modern period. In them the 17th scholar Giulio Cesare Croce found inspiration in his Le sottilissime astutie di Bertoldo ("the smart craftiness of Berthold") (1606), which in 1608 added the following Le piacevoli et ridicolose simplicità di Bertoldino ("The pleasant <b>and</b> <b>ridiculous</b> simplicity of Little Berthold"), about son of Berthold.|$|E
25|$|However, some Japanese fans {{of hip-hop}} find it {{embarrassing}} <b>and</b> <b>ridiculous</b> that these blackface fans {{do this because}} {{they feel like they}} shouldn't change their appearance to embrace the culture. In some instances it {{can be seen as a}} racist act, but for many of the young the Japanese fans it is a way of immersing in the hip hop culture the way they see fit. For example, the Japanese hip hop group Soul'd Out is extremely imitative of African American culture. Looking at Soul'd Out, their appearance stands out. Their wardrobe undoubtedly reminds one of African American fashion.|$|E

500|$|Greg Wohlwend is an American {{independent}} {{video game}} developer and artist whose games include Threes! <b>and</b> <b>Ridiculous</b> Fishing. He originally formed Intuition Games with Iowa State University classmate Mike Boxleiter in 2007 where {{they worked on}} Dinowaurs and other small Adobe Flash games. Trained as an artist, Wohlwend worked mainly on the visual assets. As Mikengreg, they released Solipskier (2010, iOS), whose success let the two take a more experimental approach with Gasketball, which did not fare as well. At the same time, Wohlwend collaborated with Asher Vollmer to make Puzzlejuice, and with Adam Saltsman to make Hundreds based on Wohlwend's first game design. He later released Threes! with Vollmer in 2014 to critical acclaim. His later games TouchTone and TumbleSeed were also the products of collaborations. Wohlwend was named among Forbes' 2014 [...] "30 under 30" [...] in the games industry.|$|E

When Cartman begins taking half credit for the joke, Kyle tells Jimmy he should stand up to Cartman. When Jimmy tells Cartman he feels he wrote most of the joke, Cartman fears Jimmy will try to take full credit and asks Kyle for {{advice on how to}} deal with Jimmy. Kyle instead says he believes Jimmy wrote the entire joke, and suggests that Cartman's ego is so big that he subconsciously remembers things incorrectly to make himself feel more important. This is supplemented by Cartman's flashbacks to the creation of the joke, which become more overblown <b>and</b> <b>ridiculous</b> as the episode goes on, showing him to truly believe that he deserves credit.|$|E

500|$|The {{period from}} 1866 to 1884 is {{characterized}} by his major illustrated stories, such as Helen Who Couldn't Help It. These stories are different in theme from works of his earlier period. The life of his characters start well, but disintegrate, as in Painter Squirtle (Maler Klecksel); someone sensitive who becomes a pedant. Others concern recalcitrant children or animals, or make the great or significant foolish <b>and</b> <b>ridiculous.</b> The early stories follow the pattern of children's books of orthodox education, such as those by Heinrich Hoffmann's Struwwelpeter, that aim to teach the devastating consequences of bad behaviour. Busch did not assign value to his work, as he once explained to Heinrich Richter: [...] "I look at my things for what they are, as Nuremberg trinkets , as Schnurr Pfeiferen [...] whose value {{is to be found}} not in its artistic content, but in public demand (...)".|$|E
500|$|Andersen's {{relationship}} with Scharff continued {{to develop and}} early in 1862 the two entered a relationship that brought Andersen [...] "joy, some kind of sexual fulfillment and a temporary end to loneliness." [...] Andersen referred to this {{time in his life}} as his [...] "erotic period", but he was not discreet in his conduct with Scharff and displayed his feelings much too openly. Onlookers regarded the relationship as improper <b>and</b> <b>ridiculous.</b> [...] The affair came to an end late in 1863 as Scharff gradually withdrew to focus on his friendship with Eckardt who had married an actress. [...] Andersen noted in his diary 13November 1863: [...] "Scharff has not visited me in eight days; with him it is over." [...] Andersen took the end of the affair calmly and the two former lovers thereafter met in overlapping social circles without bitterness. Andersen tried several times to lure Scharff into another intimate relationship but without success.|$|E
500|$|The {{failure of}} Stiffelio (attributable not {{least to the}} censors of the time taking offence at the taboo subject of the {{supposed}} adultery of a clergyman's wife and interfering with the text and roles) incited Verdi to take pains to rework it, although even in the completely recycled version of Aroldo (1857) it still failed to please. Rigoletto, with its intended murder of royalty, and its sordid attributes, also upset the censors. Verdi would not compromise: What does the sack matter to the police? Are they worried about the effect it will produce?...Do they think they know better than I?...I see the hero has been made no longer ugly and hunchbacked!! Why? [...] A singing hunchback...why not?...I think it splendid to show this character as outwardly deformed <b>and</b> <b>ridiculous,</b> and inwardly passionate and full of love. I chose the subject for these very qualities...if they are removed I can no longer set it to music.|$|E

The drummer attributed this to the acoustic tour leading the band to [...] "shed some of the fear of incorporating mellower stuff with the heavy stuff", and Grohl added that [...] "we wanted the stops to be pin-drop silent before exploding. If we had a beautiful melody, we'd throw a fucking string quartet in there. So we did everything we could to really magnify all those elements and that was fun.

500|$|The game {{is based}} on Ice Cold Beer, a {{mechanical}} arcade game in which the player controls the ends of a metal rod to raise a rolling, metal ball vertically in a wooden cabinet while avoiding holes cut into the wood. The Chicago-based indie development team found the machine at an arcade where they competitively played the 2013 video game Killer Queen. Developer Benedict Fritz later prototyped a version of Ice Cold Beer in the Unity game engine with a simple white background and black, circular holes. His friend, designer Greg Wohlwend, who had previously worked on Threes <b>and</b> <b>Ridiculous</b> Fishing, saw a short, online video of Fritz's prototype and the two began {{to work together on}} the project by adding enemies, an in-game world, and procedurally generated levels. Their prototypes included dungeon crawl and open world, action-adventure genre explorations. They spent two years designing the title and wanted to honor and contribute to the legacy of Ice Cold Beer. They also worked through a Cards Against Humanity game incubation program in 2015, and several other indie developers based in Chicago joined the production: David Laskey, Jenna Blazevich, and composer Joel Corelitz. Based on the project's loose, collaboratory nature, Metro called the game's pedigree [...] "as indie as indie gaming gets". The team released a promotional trailer in August 2016 ahead of a demo at the PAX West game show.|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast on November 12, 2009, [...] "The Camel" [...] {{was seen by}} 4.67 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. It drew a 2.1 rating/6 share among viewers aged between 18 and 49, about a five percent drop from the previous week's episode, [...] "Ron and Tammy". The episode received generally positive reviews. Matt Fowler of IGN said [...] "The Camel" [...] was a particularly funny episode, and that the parks department's collaboration on the mural allowed [...] "each character being able to instill their own level of brand-specific insanity into the mix". Fowler also praised the sewer department jokes, the [...] "murinal" [...] scene involving Jerry {{and the fact that}} no department ended up winning the mural contest, which Fowler called a commentary on [...] "the futility of local government in their attempts to accomplish anything". The Star-Ledger television columnist Alan Sepinwall declared [...] "The Camel" [...] one of the episodes he would suggest to newcomers seeking to become familiar with Parks and Recreation. Sepinwall said the Ron and Andy subplot [...] "made me laugh as hard as I have in a very long time", and said the episode had a good mix of funny, sweet <b>and</b> <b>ridiculous</b> moments, and said the ensemble cast was starting to work extremely well together.|$|E

In 1996, Computer Gaming World ranked it as the 95th best game of all time, calling it [...] "the adventure game that redefined 'wacky'." [...] The same year, Next Generation ranked it 27th best game of all time, explaining that its [...] "goofy charm" [...] was the tiebreaker in the decision to include it on the list instead of other acclaimed LucasArts games such as Day of the Tentacle. In 2004, Adventure Gamers listed Sam & Max Hit the Road as the eighth-best adventure game of all time, describing it as [...] "the most absurd <b>and</b> <b>ridiculous</b> game ever designed". IGN described Sam and Max Hit the Road in its 2007 top 100 games feature as [...] "known more for its story and characters", noting that [...] "the unusual and interesting gameplay is typically saddled in the shotgun position in fans' memories, but when you're driving a Porsche, even the trunk is a smooth ride". Writing for Adventure Classic Gaming in 2006, David Olgarsson noted that the game had [...] "undoubtedly... become [...] most critically acclaimed adventure game of all time", citing the game's production values, graphical effects, challenging puzzles and story techniques as the reason for this, concluding that the game was an [...] "enduring testament to adventure gaming’s finest hours".|$|E
500|$|In 1944, Cooper {{appeared}} in Cecil B. DeMille's wartime adventure film The Story of Dr. Wassell with Laraine Day—his third movie with the director. In the film, Cooper plays American doctor and missionary Corydon M. Wassell, who leads {{a group of}} wounded sailors through the jungles of Java to safety. Despite receiving poor reviews, Dr. Wassell {{was one of the}} top-grossing films of the year. With his Goldwyn and Paramount contracts now concluded, Cooper decided to remain independent and formed his own production company, International Pictures, with Leo Spitz, William Goetz, and Nunnally Johnson. The fledgling studio's first offering was Sam Wood's romantic comedy Casanova Brown with Teresa Wright, about a man who learns his soon-to-be ex-wife is pregnant with his child, just as he is about to marry another woman. The film received poor reviews, with the New York Daily News calling it [...] "delightful nonsense", and Bosley Crowther, in The New York Times, criticizing Cooper's [...] "somewhat obvious <b>and</b> <b>ridiculous</b> clowning". The film was barely profitable. In 1945, Cooper starred in and produced Stuart Heisler's Western comedy Along Came Jones with Loretta Young for International. In this lighthearted parody of his past heroic image, Cooper plays comically inept cowboy Melody Jones who is mistaken for a ruthless killer. Audiences embraced Cooper's character, and the film was one of the top box-office pictures of the year—a testament to Cooper's still vital audience appeal. It was also International's biggest financial success during its brief history before being sold off to Universal Studios in 1946.|$|E

The A.V.

David Buchanan of Consequence of Sound said both [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] and [...] "I Wanna Go" [...] "brings Dirty Vegas memories, plus phoning in that Far East Movement 'Like a G6' backing track {{would have been}} put to better use with Spears' producers". Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times noted Spears [...] "drags her down low as if she's Rihanna" [...] in the song. MTV writer Eliot Glazer said that, [...] "even as a mom with two kids, Britney still manages to ooze sex appeal in [...] "Beautiful," [...] cementing her place as the world's number one MILF". Hannah Rishel of The Daily Collegian said [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] was [...] "possibly [...] favorite song on the album", commenting that [...] "it's cheesy <b>and</b> <b>ridiculous,</b> but Spears makes it work in the song". Following the release of Femme Fatale, [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] reached number forty-one on South Korea's Gaon International Chart, after selling 7,500 digital units of the song alone.
