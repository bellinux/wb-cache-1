40|$|This paper studies consumers' {{preferences}} towards gluten-free products. We aim at investigating {{what are}} the factors that potentially motivate a healthy individual who is free from CD (celiac disease) and NCGS (non-celiac gluten sensitivity) to follow <b>a</b> <b>gluten-free</b> diet. The empirical analysis of our experiment suggests that the provision of additional information regarding to <b>gluten-free</b> products has <b>an</b> impact on consumers' preferences of following <b>a</b> <b>gluten-free</b> diet. Additionally, the analysis indicates that consumers' preferences of following <b>a</b> <b>gluten-free</b> diet can be influenced by their personal characteristics (reading habits, family background, etc) and any cognitive distortions (overgeneralization bias, herd behavior, etc) they might have. Lastly, the paper discusses how following <b>a</b> <b>gluten-free</b> diet is correlated with consumers' future food consuming behaviors. The results imply that consumers {{are more willing to}} try and accept a brand-new food diet if they already followed <b>a</b> <b>gluten-free</b> diet...|$|R
40|$|A {{group of}} teenage coeliac {{patients}} has been followed at three monthly intervals in the Outpatient Department {{to assess their}} progress and also to monitor their ability to maintain <b>a</b> <b>gluten-free</b> diet. After <b>a</b> follow-up period of four to six years a detailed reassessment {{was carried out in}} hospital on 10 patients, only five of whom had persevered with <b>a</b> <b>gluten-free</b> diet. The jejunal mucosal histology of those patients who did not persist with <b>a</b> <b>gluten-free</b> diet remained `flat' although these patients appeared to have remitted clinically. Those subjects who did persist with <b>a</b> <b>gluten-free</b> regime had <b>a</b> normal or near normal mucosal histology. It was difficult on the basis of clinical, haematological, or biochemical criteria to separate the two groups. The best single assessment of whether these patients were maintaining <b>a</b> <b>gluten-free</b> diet was serial serum folate estimations. It is often extremely difficult to say whether teenage coeliac patients are keeping to their diet unless repeated jejunal biopsies are obtained, and this study suggests that serial serum folate estimations can act as a reasonable criterion of whether subjects are maintaining <b>a</b> <b>gluten-free</b> regime...|$|R

40|$|Background: Canine epileptoid {{cramping}} syndrome (CECS) is a paroxysmal {{movement disorder}} of Border Terriers (BTs). These dogs might respond to <b>a</b> <b>gluten-free</b> diet. Objectives: The {{objective of this}} study was to examine the clinical and serological effect of <b>a</b> <b>gluten-free</b> diet in BTs with CECS. Animals: Six client-owned BTs with clinically confirmed CECS. Methods: Dogs were prospectively recruited that had at least a 6 -month history of CECS based on the observed phenomenology (using video) and had exhibited at least 2 separate episodes on different days. Dogs were tested for anti-transglutaminase 2 (TG 2 IgA) and anti-gliadin (AGA IgG) antibodies in the serum at presentation, and 3, 6, and 9 months after the introduction of <b>a</b> <b>gluten-free</b> diet. Duodenal biopsies were performed in 1 dog. Results: Serum TG 2 IgA titers were increased in 6 / 6 BTs (P =. 006) and AGA IgG titers were increased in 5 / 6 BTs at presentation compared to those of controls (P =. 018). After 9 months, there was clinical and serological improvement in all BTs with CECS strictly adhering to <b>a</b> <b>gluten-free</b> diet (5 / 5). One dog had persistently increased antibody titers. This dog scavenged horse manure. On the strict introduction of <b>a</b> <b>gluten-free</b> diet this dog also had an improved clinical and serological response. The diet-associated improvement was reversible in 2 dogs on completion of the study, both of which suffered a relapse of CECS on the re-introduction of gluten. Conclusions: Canine epileptoid cramping syndrome in BTs is a gluten-sensitive movement disorder triggered and perpetuated by gluten and thus responsive to <b>a</b> <b>gluten-free</b> diet. © 2015 American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT. Since {{the advent}} of serologic testing for celiac disease, most persons who receive a {{diagnosis}} of celiac disease have few or no symptoms. Although pathologic changes of celiac disease resolve on <b>a</b> <b>gluten-free</b> diet, how <b>a</b> <b>gluten-free</b> diet affects {{the quality of life}} for patients with screen-detected celiac disease is unclear. OBJECTIVE. To evaluate the effect of <b>a</b> <b>gluten-free</b> diet on the quality of life of patients with screen-detected celiac disease. DESIGN. Prospective study of patients before and 1 year after initiating <b>a</b> <b>gluten-free</b> diet. PARTICIPANTS. 19 patients with screen-detected celiac disease (found by serologically testing first-degree relatives of celiac patients) and 21 consecutive patients with symptom-detected disease. In all cases, celiac diagnosis was confirmed by finding vil-lous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia on small-bowel biopsy. INTERVENTION. Gluten-free diet (explained during a single physician visit).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Coeliac {{disease is}} a chronic disease with a various {{clinical}} presentation, including anxiety and depression. AIM: To investigate the quality of sleep in coeliac disease. METHODS: The participants were coeliacs at diagnosis; coeliacs on <b>a</b> <b>gluten-free</b> diet at follow-up and healthy volunteers. Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), SF 36, Zung and Fatigue scales and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). RESULTS: The PSQI score was higher in coeliacs at diagnosis and in <b>a</b> <b>gluten-free</b> diet than in healthy volunteers (P < 0. 001). <b>A</b> <b>gluten-free</b> diet did not improve the PSQI score (P = 0. 245) in coeliac disease. The other test scores were similar between coeliacs at diagnosis and those on <b>a</b> <b>gluten-free</b> diet, whereas {{significant differences were found}} between coeliacs and volunteers. PSQI score was inversely associated with the quality of the physical (r = - 0. 327, P = 0. 002) and mental (r = - 0. 455, P < 0. 001) component scores. The sleep quality scores were related to depression (r = 0. 633, P < 0. 001), fatigue (r = 0. 377, P < 0. 001), state anxiety (r = 0. 484, P < 0. 001) and trait anxiety (r = 0. 467, P < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disorders are common in coeliac disease not only at diagnosis but also during treatment with <b>a</b> <b>gluten-free</b> diet.

40|$|<b>A</b> <b>gluten-free</b> diet is {{currently}} the only effective means of treating individuals with celiac disease. Such a diet enables celiac patients to control their symptoms and avoid various complications associated with this condition. However, while the quality of gluten-free foods has significantly improved during recent decades, maintenance of <b>a</b> <b>gluten-free</b> diet does not necessarily ensure adequate nutritional intake. Because oats are {{an important source of}} proteins, lipids, vitamins, minerals, and fibre, their inclusion in <b>a</b> <b>gluten-free</b> diet might improve the nutritional status of a celiac patient. Although oats are included in the list of gluten-free ingredients specified in European regulations, their safety when consumed by celiac patients remains debatable. Some studies claim that pure oats are safe for most celiac people, and contamination with other cereal sources is the main problem facing people with this disease. However, it is necessary to consider that oats include many varieties, containing various amino acid sequences and showing different immunoreactivities associated with toxic prolamins.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>A</b> <b>gluten-free</b> diet is {{the only}} {{available}} treatment for celiac disease. Our aim {{was to investigate the}} effect of <b>a</b> <b>gluten-free</b> diet on celiac disease related symptoms, health care consumption, and the risk of developing associated immune-mediated diseases. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to 1, 560 randomly selected members of the Swedish Society for Coeliacs, divided into equal-sized age- and sex strata; 1, 031 (66 %) responded. Self-reported symptoms, health care consumption (measured by health care visits and hospitalization days), and missed working days were reported both for the year prior to diagnosis (normal diet) and the year prior to receiving the questionnaire while undergoing treatment with <b>a</b> <b>gluten-free</b> diet. Associated immune-mediated diseases (diabetes mellitus type 1, rheumatic disease, thyroid disease, vitiligo, alopecia areata and inflammatory bowel disease) were self-reported including the year of diagnosis. RESULTS: All investigated symptoms except joint pain improved after diagnosis and initiated gluten-free diet. Both health care consumption and missed working days decreased. Associated immune-mediated diseases were diagnosed equally often before and after celiac disease diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Initiated treatment with <b>a</b> <b>gluten-free</b> diet improves the situation for celiac disease patients in terms of reduced symptoms and health care consumption.
