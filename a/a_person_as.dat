5|$|Spirometry {{measures}} {{the amount of}} airflow obstruction present and is generally carried out after {{the use of a}} bronchodilator, a medication to open up the airways. Two main components are measured to make the diagnosis: the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), which is the greatest volume of air that can be breathed out in the first second of a breath, and the forced vital capacity (FVC), which is the greatest volume of air that can be breathed out in a single large breath. Normally, 75–80% of the FVC comes out in the first second and a FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 70% in someone with symptoms of COPD defines <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>as</b> having the disease. Based on these measurements, spirometry would lead to over-diagnosis of COPD in the elderly. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence criteria additionally require a FEV1 of less than 80% of predicted. People with COPD also exhibit a decrease in diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) due to decreased surface area in the alveoli, as well as damage to the capillary bed.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{objectification}} is the act {{of treating}} <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>as</b> a mere object of sexual desire. Objectification more broadly means treating <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>as</b> a commodity or an object without regard to their personality or dignity. Objectification is most commonly examined {{at the level of}} a society, but can also refer to the behavior of individuals.|$|E

25|$|The punishments for corrupt {{practices}} {{fall into}} two broad categories: non-criminal sanctions, and criminal punishments. The reporting, by an election court, of <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>as</b> guilty of a corrupt practice renders them immediately liable to the non-criminal sanctions, and they may additionally be prosecuted and subjected to the criminal punishments (but if they are prosecuted and acquitted, then the non-criminal sanctions are revoked). Where the election was not challenged by a petition at the time, but suspected corrupt practices are subsequently identified, a criminal prosecution can be instigated (but only within one year of the election concerned), and anyone found guilty is subject to both criminal punishment and the non-criminal sanctions.|$|E
25|$|Until August 2007 {{there was}} a system of color codes on checked baggage but the {{practice}} was discontinued after complaints of discrimination. In the past, checked baggage was screened following the personal interview and before passengers arrived at the check-in desks. Occasionally, if security assessed <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>as</b> a low risk, they were passed straight through to the check-in desks, bypassing the main X-ray machines, a practice which also drew some discrimination complaints. This process ceased in April 2014 when the main X-ray machines {{were removed from the}} passenger queuing area in terminal 3 and baggage screening began being performed after the baggage was checked-in by airline representatives (as is common in most airports around the world). Terminal 1 began using the same procedure in summer 2017.|$|E
25|$|Some Protestants confess {{their sins}} in private prayer before God, believing this suffices to gain God's pardon. However {{confession}} to another is often encouraged {{and in some}} sects or denominations required when a wrong {{has been done to}} <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>as</b> well as to God. Confession is then made to the person wronged and also to God, and is part of the reconciliation process. In cases where sin has resulted in the exclusion of a person from church membership due to unrepentance, public confession is often a prerequisite to readmission. The sinner confesses to the church his or her repentance and is received back into fellowship. In both cases there is a required manner to the confessions: for sins between God and Man and for sins between Man and Man.|$|E

25|$|Despite the uncongenial {{report of}} his Commission, the Malan {{government}} {{was willing to}} elevate Fagan to the Appellate Division, the country's highest court, in October 1950, to replace the departed Chief Justice Watermeyer. Concern was growing at that stage that the Nationalists were trying to fill the Appellate Division with loyalists, but in Fagan's case these concerns were, again, attenuated; despite his links with the government, he was a moderate whose appointment was justified on merit.Fagan's most significant judgments were about private law, raising little political intrigue: he established that gambling debts are unenforceable in South African law, and that undue influence vitiates a contract. But he did find against the government {{in its attempt to}} enforce the Population Registration Act, 1950, raising the standard of proof required to classify <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>as</b> 'non-European' on the provocative basis that Parliament could not have intended something so unjust as foisting that status on a person without adequate proof.|$|E
25|$|The story {{takes place}} in an {{alternate}} world dominated by a powerful church called the Magisterium, and where part of the soul resides outside <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>as</b> an animal companion called a dæmon. Lyra Belacqua (Dakota Blue Richards) is an orphan raised at Jordan College in Oxford, while her uncle, esteemed explorer and scholar Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig), is busy seeking the elusive Dust, a cosmic particle of which the Magisterium has forbidden even the mention. When Asriel returns from his latest expedition, Lyra and her dæmon Pantalaimon (Freddie Highmore) witness a Magisterium agent poison his wine. Lyra warns her uncle, saving his life; then she watches Asriel give a presentation regarding his findings on the North Pole, where {{he was able to}} prove the Dust's existence. The college gives Asriel a grant to fund another expedition that could lead to the discovery of the infinite worlds linked by Dust, which would severely undermine the Magisterium's hold on the world.|$|E
25|$|Bhishma {{is often}} {{considered}} as {{a great example of}} devotion and sacrifice. His name itself is an honour to him - Bhishma which means severe because he took a severe vow to remain celibate for life and Pitamah which means Grandfather. Bhishma {{was one of the greatest}} Bramhacharis of all time. Accumulation of Ojas due to his Bramhacharyam made him the strongest warrior of the era. He had stature and personality that in those times were fit for kings. He was a true Kshatriya as well as a disciplined ascetic - a rare combination. Like a true Kshatriya, he never unnecessarily exhibited passion and anger. A symbol of truth and duty, the benevolent Bhishma was in all senses a true human. It is unfortunate that <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>as</b> noble as Bhishma saw a life full of loneliness, frustration and sadness. But that was how Vashishta's curse was supposed to unfold. Bhishma's human birth was destined to be marked with suffering, and that was how his life transpired right till the last moment; even his death was very painful. But the strong as steel character which he possessed ensured that he never shied away from his duty, and never stopped loving those dear to him.|$|E

500|$|In Whitehead's view, {{there are}} a number of {{problems}} with this notion of [...] "irreducible brute matter." [...] First, it obscures and minimizes the importance of change. [...] By thinking of any material thing (like a rock, or <b>a</b> <b>person)</b> <b>as</b> being fundamentally the same thing throughout time, with any changes to it being secondary to its [...] "nature", scientific materialism hides the fact that nothing ever stays the same.
