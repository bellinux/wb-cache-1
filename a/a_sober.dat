In an odd way, perhaps incredible to you, she was always my child (it was not reciprocal as it often is in marriages)... I was her great reality, often the only liaison agent who could make the world tangible to her.|$|E
5|$|Taylor {{has lived}} a {{controversial}} lifestyle, {{during and after}} his playing career. He admitted to using drugs such as cocaine as early as his second year in the NFL, and was suspended several times by the league for failing drug tests. His drug abuse escalated after his retirement, and he was jailed three times for attempted drug possession. From 1998 to 2009, Taylor lived <b>a</b> <b>sober,</b> drug-free life. He worked as a color commentator on sporting events after his retirement, and pursued a career as an actor. His personal life came under public scrutiny in 2011 when {{he pleaded guilty to}} sexual misconduct involving a 16-year-old girl. After Taylor was put on trial, he was registered as a low-risk sex offender.|$|E
5|$|Vargas Llosa's fourth major novel, The War of the End of the World (La guerra del fin del mundo), was {{published}} in 1981 and was his first attempt at a historical novel. This work initiated a radical change in Vargas Llosa's style towards themes such as messianism and irrational human behaviour. It recreates the War of Canudos, an incident in 19th-century Brazil in which an armed millenarian cult held off a siege by the national army for months. As in Vargas Llosa's earliest work, this novel carries <b>a</b> <b>sober</b> and serious theme, and its tone is dark. Vargas Llosa's bold exploration of humanity's propensity to idealize violence, and his account of a man-made catastrophe brought on by fanaticism on all sides, earned the novel substantial recognition.|$|E

5|$|Felicia {{takes in}} Paul's son, Zach (Cody Kasch), informing him that Paul {{will not be}} returning. Zach violently attacks Felicia, forcing her to reveal that Mike has taken Paul away to kill him. Later that day, Susan goes to Mike's house to feed his dog and discovers Zach waiting with a gun. He holds Susan hostage and {{explains}} his plan to kill Mike when he returns home. Meanwhile, Mike takes Paul to a desert and coerces him into explaining the truth behind Dierdre's death. Paul explains that twelve years earlier, Dierdre, a drug addict, sold Mary Alice and Paul her baby. The couple relocate to Wisteria Lane to avoid the discovery of their crime. Sometime later, <b>a</b> <b>sober</b> Dierdre finally tracked down the Young family and attempted to take her son back. Mary Alice stabbed and killed Dierdre to prevent her from taking Zach. Together, Mary Alice and Paul buried Dierdre's body beneath their pool.|$|E
5|$|Literary scholar M. Keith Booker {{argues that}} Vargas Llosa perfects the {{technique}} of interlacing dialogues in his novel The Green House. By combining two conversations that occur at different times, he creates {{the illusion of a}} flashback. Vargas Llosa also sometimes uses this technique as a means of shifting location by weaving together two concurrent conversations happening in different places. This technique is a staple of his repertoire, which he began using {{near the end of his}} first novel, The Time of the Hero. However, he does not use interlacing dialogues in the same way in all of his novels. For example, in The Green House the technique is used in a serious fashion to achieve <b>a</b> <b>sober</b> tone and to focus on the interrelatedness of important events separated in time or space. In contrast, Captain Pantoja and the Special Service employs this strategy for comic effects and uses simpler spatial shifts. This device is similar to both Virginia Woolf's mixing of different characters' soliloquies and Gustave Flaubert's counterpoint technique in which he blends together conversation with other events, such as speeches.|$|E
5|$|The video {{introduces}} <b>a</b> <b>sober,</b> contemplative side of Madonna, {{revealing a}} mature mysticism. It {{begins with the}} camera skimming along a cracked, desiccated desert floor, and within seconds Madonna appears, hovering just above {{the ground in the}} distance. Her hands are covered with mehndi and an enigmatic symbol on one palm. In the video she slowly gestures and sways her arms toward the sky in the video, desperately pleading to her cold lover cited in the song. At one point Madonna falls, and as she hits the ground, she transforms into a flock of large, dark birds. Later, she transforms into a black dog. Three Madonnas also appear walking and crawling amid the desert throughout the video. As the song progresses, the sky darkens, and Madonna levitates from the ground. Her form then changes to a shiny black liquid, which runs along the desert floor and appears to be absorbed by the tattooed hands of another Madonna, who is curled up on the crenellated ground. The video ends with a desperate and melancholy Madonna.|$|E

25|$|The Juárez Institute {{is located}} on the corner of Cuauhtemoc and Abasolo Streets. It was built in the 19th century.

The building is two floors, with <b>a</b> <b>sober</b> facade made of stone and brick. The sides are framed by sandstone, with the main entrance on Cuauhtemoc.

25|$|Another {{important}} {{area of the}} historic center is the San Roque plaza and church. There is a stone cross, which indicates the ground was once used as a cemetery. Starting in the 1950s, this plaza was used for short one-act plays called Entremeses Cervantinos, which later developed into the Festival Cervantino. The plaza is still used for these plays as well as events associated with the annual event. The San Roque Church was dates from 1726. It has <b>a</b> <b>sober</b> Baroque façade and contains an important collection of colonial era paintings.|$|E

25|$|Hogg did {{not express}} much admiration for Shelley's poetry in the book.

The book contained many descriptions of Shelley breaking appointments, borrowing money {{that he could not}} repay, and fabricating odd stories. Hogg did not mention the atheism that he shared with Percy Shelley, fearing the effect that this disclosure could have on his reputation. He went to great lengths in the book to portray himself as conservative and loyal to the traditions of England.|$|E
