5|$|Platinum is an {{extremely}} rare metal, occurring at a concentration of only 0.005 ppm in Earth's crust. It is sometimes mistaken for silver. Platinum is often found chemically uncombined as native platinum and as alloy with the other platinum-group metals and iron mostly. Most often the native platinum is found in secondary deposits in <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposits.</b> The <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposits</b> used by pre-Columbian people in the Chocó Department, Colombia are still a source for platinum-group metals. Another large alluvial deposit is in the Ural Mountains, Russia, {{and it is still}} mined.|$|E
5|$|Once {{diamonds}} {{have been}} {{transported to the}} surface by magma in a volcanic pipe, they may erode out and be distributed over a large area. A volcanic pipe containing diamonds {{is known as a}} primary source of diamonds. Secondary sources of diamonds include all areas where a significant number of diamonds have been eroded out of their kimberlite or lamproite matrix, and accumulated because of water or wind action. These include <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposits</b> and deposits along existing and ancient shorelines, where loose diamonds tend to accumulate because of their size and density. Diamonds have also rarely been found in deposits left behind by glaciers (notably in Wisconsin and Indiana); in contrast to <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposits,</b> glacial deposits are minor and are therefore not viable commercial sources of diamond.|$|E
5|$|The main {{geological}} outcrops {{around the}} lake are mudstone, largely consisting of red siltstone resulting in the underlying characteristic of the gently rolling valley landscape.

India led the world in diamond production from the time of their discovery in approximately the 9th century BC to the mid-18th century AD, but the commercial potential of these sources had been exhausted by the late 18th century and at that time India was eclipsed by Brazil where the first non-Indian diamonds were found in 1725.|$|E
5|$|Soils in the San Juan {{watershed}} {{are mostly}} sedimentary rock and are highly erosive, resulting in large <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposits</b> along floodplains.

Steep hills in the San Juan watershed are prone to collapse during heavy rainfall or seismic activity.|$|E
50|$|Barisal is an <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposit,</b> but {{the date}} of its {{formation}} is not known. It appears probable, however, that it consisted of a chain of islands separated by wide rivers in the thirteenth century.

5|$|The main {{mining regions}} of the Empire were the Iberian Peninsula (gold, silver, copper, tin, lead); Gaul (gold, silver, iron); Britain (mainly iron, lead, tin), the Danubian provinces (gold, iron); Macedonia and Thrace (gold, silver); and Asia Minor (gold, silver, iron, tin). Intensive {{large-scale}} mining—of <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposits,</b> and by means of open-cast mining and underground mining—took place from the reign of Augustus up to the early 3rd century AD, when the instability of the Empire disrupted production. The gold mines of Dacia, for instance, were no longer available for Roman exploitation after the province was surrendered in 271. Mining seems to have resumed to some extent during the 4th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{surrounding}} valley formed {{because of}} a swell in the underlying rock of the Colorado Plateau that caused the regional elevation to intersect the Chinle and Moenkopi Formations, deposited in the Triassic about 208–245 million years ago. This area contains sandstone, siltstone, shale and limestone formed by the sediments on ancient seabeds and later <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposits</b> made by the Colorado and Paria Rivers. Because these are more easily eroded than the rock layers that lie above and below them, the Colorado Plateau gradually slopes down to river level at Lees Ferry {{through a series of}} flat benchlands.|$|E
5|$|Within Earth's crust, osmium, like iridium, {{is found}} at highest {{concentrations}} in {{three types of}} geologic structure: igneous deposits (crustal intrusions from below), impact craters, and deposits reworked {{from one of the}} former structures. The largest known primary reserves are in the Bushveld Igneous Complex in South Africa, though the large copper–nickel deposits near Norilsk in Russia, and the Sudbury Basin in Canada are also significant sources of osmium. Smaller reserves {{can be found in the}} United States. The <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposits</b> used by pre-Columbian people in the Chocó Department, Colombia are still a source for platinum group metals. The second large alluvial deposit was found in the Ural Mountains, Russia, which is still mined.|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} estimation {{is presented}} {{on the effects}} induced in an existing tunnel {{by the development of}} a fault from the deep bedrock during a seismic event. The spreading of the fault within the <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposit</b> hosting the tunnel, and the consequent effects on its permanent liner, are studied in static conditions through a series of elastic-plastic, plane strain finite element analyses. They account for the reduction of the shear strength and stiffness characteristics of the faulting zone with increasing irreversible strains. Even though the calculations require only ‘‘standard’’, e. g. peak and residual, material parameters it is shown that these properties can hardly be obtained for the <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposit</b> at hand. To overcome this drawback a relatively large scale insitu tests could be performed and its results could be interpreted through a suitable back analysis. This would permit characterizing the numerical model to be subsequently adopted for the analysis of the faulting process...|$|R

5|$|Grand Teton National Park and the {{surrounding}} region host over 1,000 species of vascular plants. With an altitude variance of over , the park {{has a number of}} different ecological zones including alpine tundra, the Rocky Mountains subalpine zone where spruce-fir forests are dominant, and the valley floor, where a mixed conifer and deciduous forest zone occupies regions with better soils intermixed with sagebrush plains atop <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposits.</b> Additionally, wetlands near some lakes and in the valley floor adjacent to rivers and streams cover large expanses, especially along the Snake River near Oxbow Bend near Moran and Willow Flats near the Jackson Lake Lodge. Altitude, available soils, wildfire incidence, avalanches and human activities have a direct impact on the types of plant species in an immediate area. Where these various niches overlap is known as an ecotone.|$|E
5|$|Karnataka {{consists}} of four main types of geological formations— the Archean complex made up of Dharwad schists and granitic gneisses, the Proterozoic non-fossiliferous sedimentary formations of the Kaladgi and Bhima series, the Deccan trappean and intertrappean deposits and the tertiary and recent laterites and <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposits.</b> Significantly, about 60% {{of the state is}} composed of the Archean complex which consist of gneisses, granites and charnockite rocks. Laterite cappings that are found in many districts over the Deccan Traps were formed after the cessation of volcanic activity in the early tertiary period. Eleven groups of soil orders are found in Karnataka, viz. Entisols, Inceptisols, Mollisols, Spodosols, Alfisols, Ultisols, Oxisols, Aridisols, Vertisols, Andisols and Histosols. Depending on the agricultural capability of the soil, the soil types are divided into six types, viz. red, lateritic, black, alluvio-colluvial, forest and coastal soils.|$|E
5|$|The main valleys {{between the}} hills {{are filled with}} <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposits</b> from the hills or sea. The county has many small rivers, most of which flow into the Bristol Channel. Many of the latter rivers now have clysts (the local name for a sluice) on them to control the sea, but {{formerly}} they were tidal for some way inland. The main exception to this is the River Parrett, which still has a tidal bore. However the Chew and the Frome flow into the Avon which forms most of the northern county boundary with Gloucestershire. The Cale flows into Dorset through the Blackmore Vale, while the Exe flows into Devon. The (Dorset) Axe, the Culm and the Otter rise in Somerset but flow into Dorset.|$|E

The bedrock under the whole area is predominantly sandstone, dating from both the Devonian period (Old Red Sandstone) and the Triassic (New Red Sandstone) laid down in arid conditions. These may subsequently have been ground down by the Taff valley glacier during the last ice age around 18,000 years ago. Radyr Stone is a Triassic breccia used widely for decorative work in the Cardiff area, including Llandaff Cathedral, Cardiff Docks and in the bridges of the Taff Vale Railway.|$|E
5|$|A silver boom {{occurred}} in England after {{the discovery of}} silver near Carlisle in 1133. Huge quantities of silver were produced from a semicircle of mines reaching across Cumberland, Durham and Northumberland – up to three to four tonnes of silver were mined each year, more than ten times the previous annual production across the whole of Europe. The result was a local economic boom and a major uplift to 12th-century royal finances. Tin mining was centred in Cornwall and Devon, exploiting <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposits</b> and governed by the special Stannary Courts and Parliaments. Tin formed a valuable export good, initially to Germany and then later in the 14th century to the Low Countries. Lead was usually mined as a by-product of mining for silver, with mines in Yorkshire, Durham and the north, {{as well as in}} Devon. Economically fragile, the lead mines usually survived as a result of being subsidised by silver production.|$|E

40|$|The diamond size-frequency {{distribution}} (SFD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} important factors determining the revenue of a diamond deposit. Since the diamond SFD typically varies spatially in an <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposit,</b> it should be modelled locally. A data set from an <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposit</b> was used to compute experimental simple- and cross-variograms for variables representing diamond abundance in a range of standard granulometric classes. These variograms display a number of striking features, firstly the larger the granulometric class the smaller the range, and secondly a negative correlation between the nugget effect (as a proportion of the total sill) and the proportion of available stones. For the sake of prediction and simulation, a simple model is proposed to reproduce these features, while also taking into account the particulate nature of diamond. At first, all points from a Cox process are interpreted as stones and assigned independent sizes. Then each stone is independently migrated as a function of its size, as would occur by geological processes. The resulting process is a marked Cox process, the properties of which are investigated...|$|R
