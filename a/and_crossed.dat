40|$|Many {{transportation}} agencies maintain grade as {{an attribute}} in roadway inventory databases; however, {{the information is}} often in an aggregated format.

5|$|Arsenal {{continued}} to dominate possession once {{the second half}} got underway, but struggled {{to use it to}} their advantage.

United threatened once the game reached the hour mark, winning duels and earning set-pieces. Gabriel Heinze's shot from about 20 yards tested Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann in the 65th minute. Five minutes later Wenger substituted Reyes off in place of Pirès.|$|E
5|$|As the two P-51s {{crossed over}} the Seine and reached Rambouillet, they sighted a {{formation}} of enemy aircraft. Brief bursts of machine gun fire dispatched four Focke-Wulf Fw 56 trainers—two falling to MacLachlan. Their victims were from JG 105. Gefreiter Walter Seigler was killed in Wrk. Nr. 1868 and Kurt Prager died in Wrk Nr. 2438. Gefreiter Alois Erdl was wounded and the aircraft written off and the fourth was able to force-land safely, damaged. Gefreiter Gotze-Gerd Kuhn was unhurt. They continued their hunt and flying near Bretigny spotted two Ju 88 night fighters or bombers coming into land. MacLachlan destroyed the first and shared the second with Page. Both aircraft belonged to IV./Kampfgeschwader 6 (KG 6—Bomber Wing 6). The pilots—Gefreiter Gerhard Zimmermann and Unteroffizier Karl Brocks—were killed. The Mustangs retreated when the airfield defences retaliated with gunfire. MacLachlan and Page returned at 1,000 feet <b>and</b> <b>crossed</b> the coast south-west of Dieppe <b>and</b> <b>crossed</b> between Brighton and Newhaven upon their return. MacLachlan was awarded a second Bar to his DFC while Page received the DFC.|$|E

30|$|Global {{trend towards}} {{sustainable}} developments have brought natural, renewable biodegradable raw material into the focus, {{but due to}} lack of technical knowhow, {{only a small fraction of}} these non-conventional fibres are harvested and utilized. In this study we have developed parallel laid 100 % banana nonwoven fabric <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> laid banana/polypropylene (60 : 40) nonwoven fabric. Three varieties of banana fibers namely Mahalaxmi, Shrimanti and Graint Naine were used for needle punched non-woven fabric preparations. Analysis of physical properties is carried out in machine direction <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> direction. This paper concludes that cross laid nonwoven fabric show superior tensile properties as compared to parallel laid nonwoven fabric. Shrimanti fibre nonwoven fabric is stronger than Graint Naine and Mahalaxmi fibre nonwoven fabric for both the parallel laid <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> laid structure. Parallel laid Mahalaxmi banana nonwoven fabric <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> laid Graint Naine banana nonwoven fabric gives higher elongation% for machine <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> direction. Increased air permeability of cross laid (60 : 40) banana/polypropylene non-woven fabric observed than parallel laid 100 % banana non-woven fabric. Parallel laid Graint Naine non-woven fabric showed higher air permeability than Shrimanti and Mahalaxmi parallel laid non-woven fabric. Bursting strength of parallel laid nonwoven fabric is higher, both in the machine as well as in cross direction than cross laid nonwoven fabric for three varieties of banana fibres. Shrimanti banana non-woven fabric showed higher bursting strength for parallel laid <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> laid structure than Graint Naine and Mahalaxmi parallel laid <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> laid structure.|$|R
