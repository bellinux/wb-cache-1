Over 130 species from numerous classes of the animal kingdom call the bank home at least temporarily. Some such fish are the Atlantic cod, silver hake, yellow-tail flounder, blue-fin and yellow-fin tuna, striped bass, blue fish and numerous species of shark including the great white shark. Shellfish such as the <b>American</b> lobster, <b>sea</b> <b>scallops,</b> squid and ocean quahogs are also prevalent. Many marine birds call the bank home including gannets, shearwaters, storm petrels, fulmars, puffins and razorbills. Reptiles are even present, primarily being represented by the leatherback sea turtle. Possibly the most famous animals on Stellwagen Bank are the mammals. Five species of seals (harp seal, gray seal, harbor seal, hooded seal, and ringed seal), and numerous whale species swim in the waters of Stellwagen. Whale watchers can frequently see humpback whales, minke whales and fin whales. There are occasional sightings {{of one of the most}} critically endangered whale species, North Atlantic right whale. Several other whale species can also be seen here including the sperm whale, beluga, orca, pilot whale, White-beaked dolphin, Atlantic white-sided dolphin, common dolphin, bottlenose dolphin, Risso’s dolphin, harbor porpoise, blue whale, and sei whale.|$|R

The Atlantic <b>sea</b> <b>scallop</b> (Placopecten magellanicus) supports {{one of the most}} economically important single-species commercial fisheries in the United States. Careful management appears to be the most powerful short-term factor affecting scallop populations, but in the coming decades scallops will be increasingly influenced by global environmental changes such as ocean warming and ocean acidification. In this paper, we describe an integrated assessment model (IAM) that numerically simulates oceanographic, population dynamic, and socioeconomic relationships for the U.

Our primary goal is to enrich resource management deliberations by offering both short- and long-term insight into the system and generating detailed policy-relevant information about the relative effects of ocean acidification, temperature rise, fishing pressure, and socioeconomic factors on the fishery using a simplified model system. Starting with relationships and data used now for <b>sea</b> <b>scallop</b> fishery management, the model adds socioeconomic decision making based on static economic theory and includes ocean biogeochemical change resulting from CO 2 emissions.

We conducted a laboratory experiment to assess interactions between larval bay scallops (Argopectin irradians irradians) and D. vexillum. We found that larval bay scallops avoid settling on D. vexillum colonies, possibly deterred by the low pH of the tunicate’s surface tissue.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the US Atlantic <b>sea</b> <b>scallop</b> fishery regulations has resulted in recovery from a biological standpoint. However, due to excessive harvest capability and regulatory inefficiencies, the industry is facing substantial harvesting costs and, hence, economic inefficiency. The main reason is that most regulations or restrictions do {{not take into account}} the fundamental importance of the property rights for inducing behavior more consonant with aggregate as well as individual rationality. This article conceptualizes the role and importance of property rights structures in their application to Atlantic <b>sea</b> <b>scallop</b> fishery management. Additionally, embryonic industry efforts in developing an enhancement program for this fishery may point to the need for more cooperative, area-based management strategies. By doing so, two important elements for achieving greater production and value from the scallop fishery are identified. First, establishing an ownership structure of private property rights in the form of Territorial User Rights in Fishing (TURFs) and second, having fishermen cooperate under an organizational structure, such as a harvesters' cooperative. These elements imply that an alternative, rights-based cooperative approach may become a compatible governance arrangement and provide an incentive for the rational management of the <b>scallop</b> fishery. <b>Sea</b> <b>scallop</b> Rights-based management TURFs Harvesters' cooperative...|$|R

40|$|Trembanis, Arthur C. After {{several decades}} of stock decline, the Atlantic <b>sea</b> <b>scallop</b> (Placopecten magellanicus) fishery {{is one of}} the most {{valuable}} in the United States due in part to the implementation of new management measures in 1994. The continued sustainability of the fishery is dependent on catch limits determined by yearly stock projection models. Incidental mortality is an important term in <b>sea</b> <b>scallop</b> stock projection models, but is historically difficult to measure. Current estimates are derived from experiments that relied heavily on qualitative observations and as a result lack precision. To better estimate incidental mortality, I used a Multiple-Before-After-Control-Impact (MBACI) experimental design to measure the effect of scallop dredging on the disposition of <b>sea</b> <b>scallops</b> that remain on the seafloor following dredging. An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) was employed to collect color photos and side-scan sonar images of the seafloor before and after controlled dredge treatments in the Mid-Atlantic and Georges Banks regions. Approximately 170, 000 photos were annotated for instances of dredge-induced mortality. I found 2. 5 % and 8 % incidental mortality for the Mid-Atlantic Bight and Georges Banks sites, respectively, a difference that is likely attributable to the relatively harder substrate of the scallop habitat on Georges Banks resulting in greater physical trauma. This study provides a quantitative estimate of incidental mortality using a precise and noninvasive platform. The spatial scale and distribution of the study sites are broader relative to past studies and represent the two principal stocks of the <b>sea</b> <b>scallop</b> resource. These results are lower than the incidental mortality values currently used in fishery stock models and suggest the existing values are conservative, but appropriate estimates.
