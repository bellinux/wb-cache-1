Polyaniline coating in {{direct contact with}} porous zinc electrode was found to restrict zincate movement away from the test electrode, which otherwise may lead to a decrease in electrode surface area �shape change of the electrode� on repeated cycling. Constant current charge/discharge cycles of the blank and polyaniline-coated zinc electrodes have been carried out to assess the performance of the polymer film.

Electrochemical results indicate that the CoO/RGO composites exhibite the highest performance when the weight ratio of CoO and RGO is 5 : 5.

40|$|A lithium cobalt {{phosphate}} (LiCoPO 4) cathode was synthesised by citric acid assisted sol–gel method and its electrochemical behaviour in <b>alkaline</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>battery</b> (using novel lithium hydroxide as the electrolyte) is reported. The sol–gel method using metal acetate precursors with citric acid as a chelating agent influenced the particle {{size and the}} homogeneity while yielding a single phase LiCoPO 4 at a considerably lower temperature and shortened heating time, {{compared to that of}} the conventional solid state reaction. The cyclic voltammogram of LiCoPO 4 showed a reversible redox process implying that de-intercalation and intercalation of lithium can occur in aqueous electrolyte. This was supported by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Infra-red (IR) studies. The charge–discharge performance of the Zn/LiCoPO 4 battery showed good capacity retention (after 25 cycles it delivered 90 % of its initial capacity). This enhanced capacity retention was attributed to the synergistic effect of particle homogeneity, reduced Li+ diffusion path and stability of the non-reactive aqueous electrolyte between the electrode and the electrolyte interface...|$|E

Although the primary zinc-air chemistry is well studied and commercially available to progress the technology into a large-scale electrically rechargeable system requires significant development.

40|$|Nickel-cadmium (Ni/Cd) and nickel-hydrogen (Ni/H 2) <b>secondary</b> <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries</b> {{are vital}} to {{aerospace}} applications. Battery performance and cycle life are significantly affected {{by the type of}} separators used in those batteries. A team from NASA Lewis Research Center's Electrochemical Technology Branch developed standardized testing procedures to characterize and evaluate new and existing separator materials to improve performance and cycle life of <b>secondary</b> <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries.</b> Battery separators must function as good electronic insulators and as efficient electrolyte reservoirs. At present, new types of organic and inorganic separator materials are being developed for Ni/Cd and Ni/H 2 batteries. The separator material previously used in the NASA standard Ni/Cd was Pellon 2505, a 100 -percent nylon- 6 polymer that must be treated with zinc chloride (ZnCl 2) to bond the fibers. Because of stricter Environmental Protection Agency regulation of ZnCl 2 emissions, the battery community has been searching for new separators to replace Pellon 2505. As of today, two candidate separator materials have been identified; however, neither of the two materials have performed as well as Pellon 2505. The separator test procedures that were devised at Lewis are being implemented to expedite the search for new battery separators. The new test procedures, which are being carried out in the Separator Laboratory at Lewis, have been designed to guarantee accurate evaluations of the properties that are critical for sustaining proper battery operation. These properties include physical and chemical stability, chemical purity, gas permeability, electrolyte retention and distribution, uniformity, porosity, and area resistivity. A manual containing a detailed description of 12 separator test procedures has been drafted and will be used by the battery community to evaluate candidate separator materials for specific applications.

40|$|Zinc {{electrode}} shape change, the {{redistribution of}} zinc material over the electrode during repeated cycling, {{has been identified}} as one of the main life-limiting factors for <b>alkaline</b> nickel oxide/zinc <b>secondary</b> <b>batteries.</b> To investigate his phe-nomenon in situ, a radiotracer, 6 ~Zn, is incorporated in the battery and its movement monitored uring repeated cycling of the battery. The changes in the distribution of 65 Zn over the electrode during battery operation are attributed to the dis-placement of radioactive zincate ions via the battery electrolyte. It is shown that the spatial distribution of ~Zn offers a reliable indication for the zinc material distribution over the electrode, provided an electrode with uniformly specific ra-dioactivity is used in the measurements. Radiotracer experiments using zinc electrodes containing 2 weight percent HgO as an additive and uniformly labeled with 2 ~ have revealed that during battery cycling no substantial net transport of mercury species occurs. It is concluded that {{it is highly unlikely that}} the mercury additive detaches from or moves over the zinc electrode surface during the cycling process.
