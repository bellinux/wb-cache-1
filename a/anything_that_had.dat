5|$|Reception {{towards the}} {{introduction}} of Takedowns was highly positive. Reviewers admired the impact that Takedowns had in transforming the boost mechanic and shifting the game's focus to a more aggressive style of driving. GamesTM {{pointed out that the}} hostile behaviour of AI rivals supplemented the system by presenting more opportunities to perform Takedowns, culminating in an intense and dramatic racing experience. Lopez explained that Burnout 3 had intelligently integrated elements of vehicular combat games by introducing Takedowns. Gerstmann commended the game's use of Impact Time and Aftertouch mechanics, which he believed made crashing an entertaining aspect of the game unlike other racers. IGN's Fran Mirabella III was amazed by the crash system; he considered it to be far ahead of <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> been done before.|$|E
5|$|The two {{go ahead}} with their plans to meet Alex, who brings along his friend, Junior (Chaddha) to the hotel. The group discuss their lives over supper, which is cut short by an {{argument}} between Alex and Sahil over the former's irresponsible behaviour. The four {{head back to the}} hotel room to collect Sahil's belongings, as Jai plans to leave later that night. Alex notices the guitar and later forces Sahil to play for him, to which Sahil obliges with an original song. Alex dances with Jai, who looks even more impressed with Sahil's artistry. Alex offers to take back Sahil's belongings and give the two some more time together. When he leaves, Sahil and Jai embrace, but do not talk about <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> happened.|$|E
5|$|At Kelmscott Press the {{perfection}} of book-making was under his constant supervision and practical assistance. It was his ambition to produce a perfect work to restore all the beauty of illuminated lettering, richness of gilding and grace of binding that {{used to make a}} volume the treasure of a king. His efforts were constantly directed towards giving the world at least one book that exceeded <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> ever appeared. Morris designed his type after the best examples of early printers, what he called his “golden type” which he copied after Jenson, Parautz, Coburger and others. With this in mind, Morris took equal care on the choice of his paper which he adapted to his subject with the same care that governed his selection of material for binding. As a result, few but only the wealthy could purchase his lavish works, mainly due to how intrinsic his work was. However, he realized that creating works in the manner of the middle ages was difficult in a profit-grinding society.|$|E

25|$|Guernica {{quickly became}} a world-renowned symbol of {{civilian}} suffering resulting from conflict and inspired Pablo Picasso to adapt one of his existing commissions into Guernica. The Spanish Republican Government had commissioned a work from him for the Spanish pavilion at the Paris International Exposition. Though he accepted the invitation to display a piece, he remained uninspired until he heard of the bombing of Guernica. Before the bombing of Guernica took place, Picasso never cared much for <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> to do with politics. Once Picasso heard the news he changed his commissioned work for Spain into a reflection on the massacre.|$|E
500|$|The new North Korean-trained unit, dubbed 5Brigade, {{passed out}} in December 1982, and was {{deployed}} by Mugabe to Matabeleland, where it remained {{for the next}} five years. In what became known as Gukurahundi, it perpetrated a number of brutal massacres and atrocities against civilians in Matabeleland accused of supporting [...] "dissidents", far exceeding <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> occurred during the Bush War. Estimates for the number of deaths range from 10,000 to 30,000. The campaign officially ended in December 1987 when Mugabe and Nkomo signed a unity accord merging ZAPU into ZANU–PF with the stated goal of a one-party state.|$|E
500|$|Musicologist Dale Cockrell {{argues that}} [...] "Old Dan Tucker" [...] {{represents}} {{a bridge between}} the percussive blackface songs of the 1830s and the more refined compositions of songwriters such as Stephen Foster. Cockrell says that, unlike previous minstrel songs, [...] "Old Dan Tucker" [...] is meant for more than just dancing; its tune is developed enough to stand on its own. Contemporary critics certainly noticed the difference. Y. S. Nathanson called it [...] "the best of what I have denominated the ancient negro ballads. The melody is far superior to <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> preceded it." [...] Nathanson compared the song to works by Gaetano Donizetti and Daniel Auber.|$|E

500|$|New Worlds {{greatest}} {{influence on}} science fiction {{came in the}} 1960s, with the [...] "New Wave" [...] that began with Moorcock's polemical editorials. [...] Moorcock asserted in 1965 that a writer of good sf [...] "can learn from his predecessors, but he should not imitate them"; and he was soon publishing stories that were quite different in technique and style from <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> appeared before, not just in New Worlds itself, but {{in any of the}} sf magazines. Moorcock's goal was to use the magazine to [...] "define a new avant-garde role" [...] for the genre. [...] New Worlds thus became the [...] "ideological center of the [...] movement to rejuvenate conjectural literature".|$|E
500|$|The Rescue {{was written}} as a short vehicle to {{introduce}} Vicki {{as the new}} companion, replacing Carole Ann Ford (Susan) when Ford decided she wanted to leave the series, and is thus more character-driven than <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> preceded it. Vicki was a replacement for the Doctor's granddaughter, Susan (Carole Ann Ford). In contrast to Susan, Vicki is an Earth orphan from the future; the production team considered many names from here, some of them odd like [...] "Lukki" [...] and [...] "Tanni". Doctor Who creator Sydney Newman told actress Maureen O'Brien that they were considering having her cut her hair and dye it black. O'Brien refused, saying, [...] "Why don't you just get Carole Ann Ford back?" ...|$|E

Burton {{recalled}} his experience {{of seeing the}} show, saying, [...] "I was still a student, I didn't know if I would be making movies or working in a restaurant, I {{had no idea what}} I would be doing. I just wandered into the theatre and it just blew me away because I'd never really seen <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> the mixture of all those elements. I actually went three nights in a row because I loved it so much." [...] Although not a fan of the musical genre, Burton was struck by how cinematic the musical was, and repeatedly attended subsequent performances. He described it as a silent film with music, and was [...] "dazzled both by the music and its sense of the macabre." [...] When his directing career took off in the late 1980s, Burton approached Sondheim with a view to making a cinematic adaptation, but nothing came of it. In Sondheim's words, [...] " [...] went off and did other things." ...|$|E

[...] Game industry executives were confused by Mysts success, not understanding how an [...] "interactive slide show" [...] {{turned out to be a}} huge hit. Online magazine writer Russell Pitts of The Escapist called Myst [...] "unlike <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> come before, weaving video almost seamlessly into a beautifully rendered world, presenting a captivating landscape filled with puzzles and mystery. In a game market dominated by Doom clones and simulators, Myst took us by the hand and showed us the future of gaming. It took almost a decade for anyone to follow its lead." [...] Critics from Wired and Salon considered the games approaching the level of art, while authors Henry Jenkins and Lev Manovich pointed out the series as exemplifying the promise of new media to create unseen art forms.|$|E
500|$|After {{the already}} tense {{relations}} between ZANU–PF and ZAPU disintegrated amid Mugabe's wish {{to adopt a}} one-party system in Zimbabwe, Mugabe expelled Nkomo from the government in February 1982, accusing him and ZAPU of plotting a coup. About a year later, Mugabe deployed the North Korean-trained 5Brigade to Matabeleland, ZAPU's heartland, where it massacred thousands of civilians accused of supporting [...] "dissidents" [...] in what became called Gukurahundi. Meredith asserts that this far exceeded <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> occurred during the Bush War, an opinion shared by Geoff Hill. Some white farmers were also killed. Estimates {{for the number of}} deaths during the five-year Gukurahundi campaign range from 10,000 to 30,000. Mugabe concurrently took steps to marginalise the other main black nationalist leaders from the Chimurenga. Nkomo fled to the UK in March 1983, fearing for his life; Sithole similarly exiled himself in the United States. Muzorewa stayed in Zimbabwe and was detained in late 1983 for alleged [...] "subversive links" [...] with South Africa. On arriving in England, Nkomo accused Mugabe of genocide and asserted that [...] "Things are worse now than they ever were under Ian Smith". Mugabe denied that anything improper was happening and put reports to the contrary down to [...] "reactionary foreign journalists".|$|E
500|$|Knights of the Old Republic II {{uses the}} same d20 System as the first Knights of the Old Republic with some changes, and the level cap has also been removed. For the most part, the team didn't want to redo any of the design {{elements}} from the first game, as they {{felt that there was}} no need to change <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> already proved successful; instead, they opted to look for areas that could be improved and expanded upon them in a way that retained the base style of Knights of the Old Republic. Obsidian put much work into the game's graphics, including the appearances of non-player characters. Other technological improvements include the lighting and weather effects, in addition to increasing the level sizes. Knights of the Old Republic IIs lead artist was Aaron Meyers; he decided which people would join the art team after looking through [...] "tons of applications, resumes, and demo reels", and he said that he was pleased with the amount of people who wanted to work for Obsidian. Meyers also complained about the short deadline the development team had to deal with. Obsidian's COO, Chris Parker, said that the schedule set for the development team was [...] "extremely aggressive", and that the team felt a lot of pressure because they were [...] "making a sequel to the game of the year for 2003".|$|E

500|$|Phantasmagoria {{took more}} than two years to develop. Sierra {{officials}} said this was because it was so different from <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> been done previously, in both the Hollywood or computer game industries, and the new challenges led to complexities. Roberta Williams said: [...] "It took a full year just to get people to understand what I wanted to do." [...] The game experienced multiple delays before it was ultimately released. It was originally planned that the game would be in stores by late 1993 or early 1994, with Sierra saying it would come out no later than the fall of 1994. The game was previewed at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago in June 1994, where it was announced the release date had been pushed back to October 1994 and that the game would be made available on two discs. The game ultimately required seven discs. The shipping date was later changed again to Christmas 1994, and then February 1995, before Sierra said it would be delayed yet again as the company continued to refine the technology of live-action video. It was announced the game would be ready in June 1995, but when Sierra organized road shows that month to market 18 of its new games, Phantasmagoria was not among them because it was not ready yet.|$|E
500|$|According to Nicholson, Agharta {{and other}} jazz-rock {{recordings}} such as Emergency! (1970) by the Tony Williams Lifetime suggested the genre was progressing toward [...] "a whole new musical language... a wholly independent genre {{quite apart from}} the sound and conventions of <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> gone before". This development dwindled with the commercialism of jazz in the 1980s, he said, although Agharta remained a pivotal and influential record through the 1990s, especially on artists in the experimental rock genre. It became one of the favorite albums for English musician Richard Kirk, who recalled playing the record often while working at Chris Watson's loft during their early years in the band Cabaret Voltaire. [...] "I can see how this album might have annoyed people but for me it was really nice grooves with improvisation and would open out and become more minimal", Kirk later told The Quietus. Along with On the Corner, it was also a major influence on the Beastie Boys' 1994 hip hop album Ill Communication. In 1998, composer and bandleader David Sanford completed his dissertation on Agharta as a doctoral student in composition at Princeton University. In it, he argued that the album demonstrated how jazz has utilized a variety of external influences [...] "to evolve or modernize itself". In an interview several years later, Sanford said it was an important work that had gone to the [...] "fringes of jazz" [...] and a place most other music has not explored since. In the All Music Guide to Jazz (2002), Thom Jurek considered the album to be inarguably the [...] "greatest electric funk-rock jazz record ever" [...] and declared [...] "there is simply nothing like Agharta in the canon of recorded music." ...|$|E
