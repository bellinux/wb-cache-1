Superboy becomes a core member of the Legion during two extended, full membership stints in the Legion, including two terms as Deputy Leader.

2500|$|The {{lifespan}} of {{killer whales}} in captivity versus wild killer whales is disputed. [...] Several studies published in scientific journals {{show that the}} average mortality rate for captive killer whales is approximately three times {{higher than in the}} wild. A 2015 study in the Journal of Mammalogy, authored by SeaWorld's vice-president of theriogenology, Todd Robeck, concluded that the life expectancy for killer whales born at SeaWorld is the same as those in the wild. In the wild, female killer whales have a typical lifespan of 60–80 years, and a maximum recorded lifespan of 103 years. [...] The average lifespan for males in the wild is 30 years, but some live up to 50–60 years. The 2015 study has been criticised by Trevor Willis, senior lecture in marine biology at the University of Portsmouth, who stated that the study is misleading, [...] "clearly wrong" [...] and indicative of [...] "poor practice". [...] He stated that it is misleading in two ways: [...] "First, it compares two completely different circumstances: the controlled environment of a swimming pool, with highly trained vets on hand; and the wild ocean. [...] "There are no predators in a swimming pool. Second, {{and in the absence of}} <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>information,</b> it appears they’ve looked at the survival rate of calves in the first two years of life and extrapolated it out 50 years into the future." [...] He also stated that no captive orca has lived for 55.8 years, the recorded average life expectancy of adult orcas at SeaWorld.|$|E
2500|$|However, in 2007 the U.S. District Court {{struck down}} even the reauthorized NSLs because the gag power was unconstitutional as courts could still {{not engage in}} {{meaningful}} judicial review of these gags. On August 28, 2015, Judge Victor Marrero of the federal district court in Manhattan ruled the gag order of Nicholas Merrill was unjustified. In his decision, Judge Marrero described the FBI's position as, [...] "extreme and overly broad," [...] affirming that [...] "courts consistent with the First Amendment, simple accept the Government's assertions that disclosure would implicate and create a risk." [...] He {{also found that the}} FBI's gag order on Mr. Merrill [...] "implicates serious issues, both with respect to the First Amendment and accountability of the government to the people." [...] Initially, the ruling was released in redaction by Judge Marrero. The FBI was given 90 days to pursue any other alternative course of action, but elected not to do so. Upon release of the unredacted ruling on November 30, 2015, it was revealed {{for the first time the}} extent to which the FBI's NSL accompanied by a gag order sought to collect information. Through the court documents, it was revealed for the first time that through an NSL, the FBI believes it can legally obtain information including an individual's complete web browsing history, the IP addresses of everyone a person has corresponded with, and all the records of all online purchases within the last 180 days. The FBI also claims via the extension of a NSL, it can obtain cell site location information. In the landmark case of Nicholas Merrill the FBI in specific sought to seek the following information on an account: DSL account information, radius log, subscriber name and related subscriber information, account number, date the account opened or closed, addresses associated with the account, subscriber day/evening telephone numbers, screen names or other on-line names associated with the account, order forms, records relating to merchandise orders/shipping information for the last 180 days, all billing related to the account, internet service provider (ISP), all email addresses associated with the account, internet protocol address assigned to the account, all website information registered to the account, uniform resource locator address assigned to the account, <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>information</b> which you consider to be an electronic communication transactional record. This was the first time it was revealed the extent to which an NSL under the Patriot Act could request communication information.|$|E
