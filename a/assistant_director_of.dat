5|$|Creating the {{new design}} was the {{responsibility}} of Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock, {{who had been in}} his position since 1925. Much of the work in preparing the new coin was done by Sinnock's assistant, later chief engraver Gilroy Roberts. In early October 1945, Sinnock submitted models to <b>Assistant</b> <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> the Mint F. Leland Howard (then acting as director), who transmitted them to the Commission of Fine Arts.

5|$|In 1979, {{problems}} with the export policy were becoming apparent. The Soviets continued to sell newer aircraft designs to their clients, placing allies of the U.S. at a disadvantage. Denied by the U.S., countries were turning to other vendors for modern fighters, notably France's Dassault Mirage 2000. Barry N. Blechman, <b>Assistant</b> <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, testified that the US reductions in foreign arms transfers had actually encouraged other nations and increased worldwide arms sales. At the same time, there was considerable pressure to provide a suitable aircraft for Taiwan.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} case study of {{leadership}} processes and the creation of quality assurance routines within a newly formed large department (approximately 260 employees) at a major Swedish university. The study focuses on social actions taken by two assistant heads of departments and twelve <b>assistant</b> <b>directors</b> <b>of</b> study and shows how the two assistant heads of department used listening dialogue as an important aspect of their leadership style. The leadership process of enhancing the department’s quality assurance routines was characterized by active listening, and the study describes how one of the two assistant heads of department negotiated with the twelve <b>assistant</b> <b>directors</b> <b>of</b> study, leading to a) a departmental consensus among the twelve <b>assistant</b> <b>directors</b> <b>of</b> study as to the design and use of online student evaluation forms and b) enhanced quality assurance dialogues between the assistant head of department and the twelve <b>assistant</b> <b>directors</b> <b>of</b> study. The findings are discussed in the light of research on leadership styles in Swedish knowledge-intensive workplaces. This research has shown that successful leadership in such contexts is often characterized by leaders displaying non-hierarchical behaviour and having good listening skills, leading to high levels of mutual trust within the organization...|$|R
