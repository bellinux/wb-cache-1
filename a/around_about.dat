The ShadowClan medicine cat recognizes it as parsley, a herb that stops the milk of a cat whose kits die. Jayfeather remembers that while going back to the camp after birth, there is another cat with him besides Squirrelflight: Leafpool, Jayfeather's true mother.|$|E

Cassani then alleged that a motor could easily be stowed in the seattube of the bike and the button {{to turn it on}} would be located on the handlebars. In the YouTube video, Cassani showed clips of Cancellara at the two races allegedly [...] "turning on" [...] the motor while riding and showing the drastic increase in speed.

500|$|In December 1917, {{because the}} Russian {{divisions}} were deserting the region en masse, the Russian command authorized {{the formation of}} the Armenian Army Corps under the Transcaucasian Commissariat. Under the command of General Nazarbekian, the Corps was positioned in the front line from Van to Erzincana city of <b>around</b> <b>about</b> 20,000 people. Two of the Corps' three divisions were made up of Russian Armenians, while Andranik commanded the Turkish (Western) Armenian division. The Georgian forces patrolled the area between Erzincan and the Black Sea. Hovannisian states that the only [...] "several thousand men now defended a 300-mile front formerly secured by a half million Russian regulars". Since December 1917, Andranik commanded the Armenian forces in Erzurum. In January 1918, he was appointed commander of the Western Armenian division of the Armenian Army Corps and given the rank of major-general by the Caucasus Front command. Andranik was unable to defend Erzurum for long and the outnumbering Turks captured the city on 12 March 1918, forcing the Armenians to evacuate.|$|E
500|$|Lorraine Calvert {{joined the}} series as costume {{designer}} for the season. On adapting Elektra's costume for the season, {{which in the}} comics usually consists of impractically [...] "strappy" [...] red cloth, Calvert decided to make it utilitarian and appealing, while still being faithful to the comics. Originally starting out opposite of the eventual sleek design for both her fighting and daytime attire, Calvert said, [...] "Ideas were tossed <b>around</b> <b>about</b> how she was possibly bohemian, [...] she was a free spirit who traveled {{all over the world}} with as much money as she possibly could." [...] This eventually led to the final, sleeker design, because Elektra [...] "really needs a very simple, elegant line because too much cloth is overwhelming." [...] The costume consisted of [...] "black moto pants, a one-piece zippered body suit, a sleeveless vest, and red cloth to provide the highlights and the hood covering Elektra’s face." [...] The shade of the red used for Elektra throughout the season was chosen so it would not clash with the red in Daredevil's costume, as well as to match the darker tone of the series.|$|E

500|$|The book {{consists}} of 18 chapters, each covering roughly {{one hour of}} the day, beginning <b>around</b> <b>about</b> 8a.m. and ending sometime after 2a.m. the following morning. Each of the 18 chapters of the novel employs its own literary style. Each chapter also refers to a specific episode in Homer's Odyssey and has a specific colour, art or science and bodily organ associated with it. This combination of kaleidoscopic writing with an extreme formal, schematic structure {{represents one of the}} book's major contributions to the development of 20th century modernist literature. The use of classical mythology as a framework for his book and the near-obsessive focus on external detail in a book in which much of the significant action is happening inside the minds of the characters are others. Nevertheless, Joyce complained that, [...] "I may have oversystematised Ulysses," [...] and played down the mythic correspondences by eliminating the chapter titles that had been taken from Homer. Joyce was reluctant to publish the chapter titles because he wanted his work to stand separately from the Greek form. [...] It was only when Stuart Gilbert published his critical work on Ulysses in 1930 that the schema was supplied by Joyce to Gilbert. But as Terrence Killeen points out this schema was developed after the novel had been written and was not something that Joyce consulted as he wrote the novel.|$|E
500|$|The {{conceptual}} Persona 3 {{was submitted}} to Atlus in 2003 by Katsura Hashino, {{who had worked}} as a designer for multiple Megami Tensei titles and had been the director for Nocturne. Gaining Atlus' approval of the concept, development started in the same year, after the completion of Nocturne and the [...] duology. Persona 3 was part of Atlus' push to expand their player base in the West. Ideas were being passed <b>around</b> <b>about</b> Persona 4, but the title did not begin official development until after the release of Persona 3. Preparations for Persona 5s development began in 2010. The team decided to shift towards more challenging story themes, saying that the shift would be more drastic than that experienced with Persona 3. Persona 4 Arena and its sequel were the first non-RPG collaborative project in the series: its success inspired the creation of both Persona Q and Dancing All Night. Beginning with Persona 3, a dedicated team originally referred to as [...] "2nd Creative Production Department" [...] has handled development for the series. The team was later dubbed [...] "P-Studio". Aside from Atlus, other developers have helped develop entries in the Persona series. During the pre-production stage of Persona 4 Arena, Hashino approached Arc System Works after being impressed by their work on the BlazBlue series. For Dancing All Night, development was initially handled by Dingo, who were well known for the [...] series. Citing quality concerns, Atlus took over development.|$|E
500|$|... "I Luv This Shit" [...] {{was written}} by August Alsina, The Exclusives (Sean McMillion and Ralph Jeanty), Samuel Irving III, Christine Massa, and Trinidad James and was {{produced}} by Knucklehead. It was recorded by McMillion and Cody Sciara at Goldie's Playhouse and Zac Recording Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, and mixed by Jaycen Joshua with assistance from Trehy Harris at Larrabee Sound Studios, North Hollywood. Vocals were produced by The Exclusives. Knucklehead told Vibe in 2014 that he created the song's beat and {{knew it would be}} successful, stating: [...] "I just knew what [...] voice was gonna do over my beat. And that beat didn't sound like thing else at the time that was out ... When I made the beat, I called him immediately after I finished it." [...] After playing the beat to Alsina and The Exclusives, they recorded the song in one hour. It is an R song instrumented by guitar, synthesizer, synth-horns and a heavy bassline. The production was compared by Spin Brandon Soderberg to the work of The-Dream. It revolves <b>around</b> <b>about</b> partying with alcohol and drugs with the central hook [...] "I love this shit", and references the vodka Ciroc, yet {{there is an element of}} sorrow to Alsina's vocals. James' verse contemplates human nature, according to Gregory Adams of Exclaim!. [...] "I Luv This Shit" [...] was originally recorded for Alsina's mixtape The Product 2 (2013), and was included on his debut EP [...] (2013). It was also a bonus track on his first studio album, Testimony (2014).|$|E
