5|$|Biblical Hebrew {{after the}} Second Temple period evolved into Mishnaic Hebrew, which ceased being spoken and {{developed}} into <b>a</b> <b>literary</b> language around 200 CE.

Currently, Classical Hebrew is generally taught in public schools in Israel, and Biblical Hebrew forms are sometimes used in Modern Hebrew literature, much as archaic and biblical constructions are used in Modern English literature. Since Modern Hebrew contains many biblical elements, Biblical Hebrew is fairly intelligible to Modern Hebrew speakers.|$|E

Despite the initial excitement surrounding the project and content from noted writers such as John Sylvester John Gardiner, The Tablet lasted {{only a few months}} before folding, having published thirteen issues.|$|E

5|$|Despite much speculation, {{there is}} no {{definitive}} explanation of either Linnaeus fils or Herbert's thinking.

The flower name has even been compared to the mediaeval weapon, the spoked mace or Morning Star which it superficially resembles.|$|E
