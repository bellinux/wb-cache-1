25|$|Individuals of African descent have a {{lower level}} of binge {{drinking}} followed by those of Asian descent. In the case of Asians their low level of binge drinking {{may be due to the}} presence of the <b>aldehyde</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> gene (ALDH2, Chromosome 12) in many (but by no means the vast majority) that results in poor metabolism of alcohol, which leads to severe adverse effects such as facial flushing.|$|E
25|$|In {{traditional}} medicine, kudzu {{has been}} used as a remedy for alcoholism, hangover, measles, menopausal symptoms, diabetes mellitus, fever, common cold, and neck or eye pain. However, a 2007 study suggested that the use of the kudzu root is inappropriate as a hangover remedy due to increased acetaldehyde accumulation through mitochondrial <b>aldehyde</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> inhibition. Kudzu has no benefit for treating cancer and is specifically contraindicated in people with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|Genetics: alleles {{associated}} with <b>aldehyde</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> (ALDH) and flushing phenotypes (alcohol flush reaction) in Asians are known genetic {{factors that influence}} alcohol tolerance {{and the development of}} hangover effects. Existing data shows that drinkers with genotypes known to lead to acetaldehyde accumulation are more susceptible to hangover effects. The fact that about 25% of heavy drinkers claim that they have never had a hangover is also an indication that genetic variation plays a role in individual differences of hangover severity.|$|E
50|$|In humans, {{there are}} three known genes which encode this enzymatic activity, ALDH1A1, ALDH2, and the more {{recently}} discovered ALDH1B1 (also known as ALDH5). These enzymes {{are members of the}} larger class of <b>aldehyde</b> <b>dehydrogenases.</b>|$|R
50|$|The best studied {{cellular}} antioxidants are the enzymes {{superoxide dismutase}} (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. Less well studied (but probably just as important) enzymatic antioxidants are the peroxiredoxins and the recently discovered sulfiredoxin.

50|$|<b>Aldehyde</b> <b>dehydrogenases</b> oxidize various <b>aldehydes</b> to the {{corresponding}} acids. They {{are involved in}} the detoxification of alcohol-derived acetaldehyde and in the metabolism of corticosteroids, biogenic amines, neurotransmitters, and lipid peroxidation. The enzyme encoded by this gene forms a cytoplasmic homodimer that preferentially oxidizes aromatic aldehyde substrates. The gene is located within the Smith-Magenis syndrome region on chromosome 17.|$|R
25|$|It is {{also thought}} there {{is perhaps a}} genetic {{predisposition}} for some alcoholics that results in increased frequency of alcoholic polyneuropathy in certain ethnic groups. During the body’s processing of alcohol, ethanol is oxidized to acetaldehyde mainly by alcohol dehydrogenase; acetaldehyde is then oxidized to acetate mainly by <b>aldehyde</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> (ALDH). ALDH2 is an isozyme of ALDH and ALDH2 has a polymorphism (ALDH2*2, Glu487Lys) that makes ADLH2 inactive; this allele is more prevalent among Southeast and East Asians and results in a failure to quickly metabolize acetaldehyde. The neurotoxicity resulting from the accumulation of acetaldehyde {{may play a role}} in the pathogenesis of alcoholic polyneuropathy.|$|E

During this work he collaborated with Frederick Sanger whose group he joined with a short-term Medical Research Council appointment.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{indicated}} keratoconic corneas show signs of increased activity by proteases, a class of enzymes that break some of the collagen cross-linkages in the stroma, with a simultaneous reduced expression of protease inhibitors. Other studies have suggested that reduced activity by the enzyme <b>aldehyde</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> may be responsible for a build-up of free radicals and oxidising species in the cornea. Whatever the pathogenetical process, the damage caused by activity within the cornea likely results in a reduction in its thickness and biomechanical strength. At an ultrastructural level the weakening of the corneal tissue is associated with a disruption of the regular arrangement of the collagen layers and collagen fibril orientation. While keratoconus is considered a noninflammatory disorder, one study shows wearing rigid contact lenses by people leads to overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, TNF-alpha, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 in the tear fluid.|$|E

500|$|A common local {{belief is}} that the durian is harmful when eaten with coffee or {{alcoholic}} beverages. The latter belief {{can be traced back}} at least to the 18th century when Rumphius stated that one should not drink alcohol after eating durians as it will cause indigestion and bad breath. In 1929, J. D. Gimlette wrote in his Malay Poisons and Charm Cures that the durian fruit must not be eaten with brandy. In 1981, J. R. Croft wrote in his Bombacaceae: In Handbooks of the Flora of Papua New Guinea that [...] "a feeling of morbidity" [...] often follows the consumption of alcohol too soon after eating durian. Several medical investigations on the validity of this belief have been conducted with varying conclusions, though a study by the University of Tsukuba finds the fruit's high sulphur content inhibits the activity of <b>aldehyde</b> <b>dehydrogenase,</b> causing a 70% reduction of the ability to clear toxins from the body.|$|E
500|$|The {{three main}} systems {{affected}} by ethylene glycol poisoning are {{the central nervous}} system, metabolic processes, and the kidneys. The central nervous system is affected early {{in the course of}} poisoning {{as the result of a}} direct action of ethylene glycol. Similar to ethanol, it causes intoxication, followed by drowsiness or coma. Seizures may occur due to a direct effect. The toxic mechanism of ethylene glycol poisoning is mainly due to the metabolites of ethylene glycol. Initially it is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to glycolaldehyde, which is then oxidized to glycolic acid by <b>aldehyde</b> <b>dehydrogenase.</b> [...] The increase in metabolites may cause encephalopathy or cerebral edema. The metabolic effects occur 12 to 36 hours post ingestion, causing primarily metabolic acidosis which is due mainly to accumulated glycolic acid. Additionally, as a side effect of the first two steps of metabolism, an increase in the blood concentration of lactic acid occurs contributing to lactic acidosis. The formation of acid metabolites also causes inhibition of other metabolic pathways, such as oxidative phosphorylation.|$|E
40|$|Background: Variation {{in alcohol}} {{metabolism}} affects {{the duration of}} intoxication and alcohol use. While the majority of genetic association studies investigating variation in alcohol metabolism have focused on polymorphisms in alcohol or <b>aldehyde</b> <b>dehydrogenases,</b> we have now tested for association with genes in alternative metabolic pathways that catalyze the carbon skeleton of ethanol (EtOH) and NADH reoxidation. Methods: Nine hundred fifty single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning 14 genes (ACN 9...|$|R
40|$|Influence {{of vitamin}} A (retinol) on growth {{depends on its}} {{sequential}} oxidation to retinal and then to retinoic acid (RA), producing a ligand for RA receptors essential in development of specific tissues. Genetic studies have revealed that <b>aldehyde</b> <b>dehydrogenases</b> function as tissue-specific catalysts for oxidation of retinal to RA. However, enzymes catalyzing {{the first step of}} RA synthesis, oxidation of retinol to retinal, remain unclear because none of the present candidate enzymes have expression patterns that fully overlap with those of <b>aldehyde</b> <b>dehydrogenases</b> during development. Here, we provide genetic evidence that alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) performs this function by demonstrating a role for Adh 3, a ubiquitously expressed form. Adh 3 null mutant mice exhibit reduced RA generation in vivo, growth deficiency that can be rescued by retinol supplementation, and completely penetrant postnatal lethality during vitamin A deficiency. ADH 3 was also shown to have in vitro retinol oxidation activity. Unlike the second step, the first step of RA synthesis is not tissue-restricted because it is catalyzed by ADH 3, a ubiquitous enzyme having an ancient origin...|$|R
40|$|<b>Aldehyde</b> <b>dehydrogenases</b> (ALDHs) are {{a family}} of enzymes which {{catalyze}} the oxidation of reactive aldehydes to their corresponding carboxylic acids. Here we summarize molecular genetic and biochemical analyses of selected Arabidopsis ALDH genes. Aldehyde molecules are very reactive and are involved in many metabolic processes but when they accumulate in excess they become toxic. Thus activity of <b>aldehyde</b> <b>dehydrogenases</b> is important in regulating the homeostasis of aldehydes. Overexpression of some ALDH genes demonstrated an improved abiotic stress tolerance. Despite the fact that several reports are available describing a role for specific ALDHs, their precise physiological roles are often still unclear. Therefore a number of genetic and biochemical tools have been generated to address the function {{with an emphasis on}} stress-related ALDHs. ALDHs exert their functions in different cellular compartments and often in a developmental and tissue specific manner. To investigate substrate specificity, catalytic efficiencies have been determined using a range of substrates varying in carbon chain length and degree of carbon oxidation. Mutational approaches identified amino acid residues critical for coenzyme usage and enzyme activities...|$|R
500|$|The ectomycorrhizae of T.vaccinum {{has been}} the subject of {{considerable}} research. Ectomycorrhizae of Tricholoma species can vary considerably among species in the genus, and differences in the structure of [...] rhizomorphs (a cordlike fusions of hyphae resembling a root) have been used to key out species. Mycorrhizae formed with Norway spruce (Picea abies) are conspicuously hairy with numerous hyphae. The hyphae are partly densely interconnected to rhizomorphs that have a pigment in their outer membrane. The emanating hyphae mostly lack [...] "contact septae" [...] (fully developed simple septae) and contact clamps, and the rhizomorph hyphae vary markedly in diameter. The Hartig net (a network of hyphae that extend into the root) formed by T.vaccinum grows more deeply towards the epidermis, is composed of more rows of hyphae and has more tannin cells in close proximity to the epidermis, and consequently, fewer cortical cells in this position. It is here that the rhizomorphs make the closest contact with the rootlets. The mantle is prosenchymatous, meaning that the constituent hyphae are loosely organized with spaces between them. A combination of techniques including freeze fracturing and scanning electron microscopy has been used to probe the microstructure of the ectomycorrhizae, including inner mantle thickness and the nature of the interface between the Hartig net and host cells. Several fungal genes specifically expressed during ectomycorrhizal interaction between T.vaccinum and Picea abies have been identified, including some involved in a plant pathogen response, nutrient exchange and growth in the plant, signal transduction, and stress response. The first characterized fungal <b>aldehyde</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> enzyme, ALD1, helps circumvent ethanol stress—a critical function in mycorrhizal habitats.|$|E

Methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency is characterized by elevated beta-alanine, 3-hydroxypropionic acid, and both isomers of 3-amino and 3-hydroxyisobutyric acids in urine organic acids. Methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency is caused by mutations in this gene and the resulting protein.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} elevated levels of biogenic aldehydes in the brains of patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). In the brain, aldehydes are primarily detoxified by <b>aldehyde</b> <b>dehydrogenases</b> (ALDH). Reduced ALDH 1 expression in surviving midbrain dopamine neurons {{has been reported in}} brains of patients who died with PD. In addition, impaired complex I activity, which is well documented in PD, reduces the availability of the NAD+ co-factor required by multiple ALDH isoforms to catalyze the removal of biogenic aldehydes. We hypothesized that chronically decreased function of multiple <b>aldehyde</b> <b>dehydrogenases</b> consequent to exposure to environmental toxins and/or reduced ALDH expression, {{plays an important role in}} the pathophysiology of PD. To address this hypothesis, we generated mice null for Aldh 1 a 1 and Aldh 2, the two isoforms known to be expressed in substantia nigra dopamine neurons. Aldh 1 a 12 / 26 Aldh 22 / 2 mice exhibited age-dependent deficits in motor performance assessed by gait analysis and by performance on an accelerating rotarod. Intraperitoneal administration of L-DOPA plus benserazide alleviated the deficits in motor performance. We observed a significant loss of neurons immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the substantia nigra and a reduction of dopamine and metabolites in the striatum of Aldh 1 a 12 / 26 Aldh 22 / 2 mice.
