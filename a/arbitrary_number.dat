Dirks wrote the initial code for the NUPACK suite of nucleic acid design and analysis tools, which generates base pairing probabilities through calculation of the statistical partition function. Unlike other structure prediction tools, NUPACK is capable of handling an <b>arbitrary</b> <b>number</b> of interacting strands rather than being limited to one or two. Dirks also developed an algorithm capable of efficiently handling certain types of pseudoknots, a class of structure that is more computationally intensive to analyze, although NUPACK only implements this ability for single RNA strands.|$|E

Here, the ability to detect heterozygous mutations is important and this can only be done if the sequence of the diploid genome is obtained.

Wendl and Wilson followed with a more general theory that allowed for an <b>arbitrary</b> <b>number</b> of coverings of each allele and arbitrary ploidy.

25|$|In {{the media}} and popular science, quantum non-locality is often portrayed as being {{equivalent}} to entanglement. While {{it is true that}} a pure bipartite quantum state must be entangled in order for it to produce non-local correlations, there exist entangled states that do not produce such correlations, and there exist non-entangled (separable) quantum states that present some non-local behaviour. A well-known example of the first case is the Werner state that is entangled for certain values of , but can always be described using local hidden variables. In short, entanglement of a two-party state is necessary but not sufficient for that state to be non-local. Moreover, it was shown that, for <b>arbitrary</b> <b>number</b> of party, there exist states that are genuinely entangled but admits a fully local strategy. It {{is important to recognize that}} entanglement is more commonly viewed as an algebraic concept, noted for being a precedent to non-locality as well as to quantum teleportation and to superdense coding, whereas non-locality is defined according to experimental statistics and is much more involved with the foundations and interpretations of quantum mechanics.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} integer {{random access}} machines (RAMs) that receive {{one of two}} types of special integers as extra inputs: <b>arbitrary</b> <b>numbers</b> and random <b>numbers.</b> <b>Arbitrary</b> <b>numbers</b> are numbers that have no special property, other than being large-valued. Informally, one can consider them as adversarially-chosen numbers. Intuitively, it would not seem that <b>arbitrary</b> <b>numbers</b> offer any value. However, previous studies have shown for specific problems that such numbers contribute to the computational power of a RAM. The present work gives, for the first time, a broad characterisation of the scenarios in which <b>arbitrary</b> <b>numbers</b> do and those in which they do not increase computational power, rather than considering specific problems. The second type of extra inputs, random numbers, is conceptually an intermediate ground between Oracle-given certificates and adversarially-chosen <b>arbitrary</b> <b>numbers.</b> The contribution of random inputs to Turing machines is the famous P=RP problem. In the context of RAMs, it was posed as an open question by Simon (1981). The present study closes this problem, by showing that for certain RAMs randomness does provide an advantage, whereas for others it does not. In order to achieve the results presented, this work also reviews classical results regarding certificates {{and the use of}} indirect addressing (which is a pseudo-operation available to RAMs, but which can be conceptually disabled so as to have its contribution modelled). In both cases, our results sharpen the state-of-the-art. In the case of certificates, we show how results by Simon (1981) on RAMs with certificates continue to hold also with a slightly reduced operation set (as well as with new operation sets). In the case of indirect addressing, we show how, for specific RAMs, this pseudo-operation can be simulated with no loss of complexity, whereas previously {{the state of the art}} was for a loss of complexity by a factor of the inverse Ackermann function. The following are some of our main results. We define a new complexity class, PEL, which formalises the idea of describing the power of a RAM in terms of its capacity to generate large numbers, and show that for a wide class of RAMs (specifically those that support addition, Boolean operations, left-shift by a variable amount and division) computational power is, indeed, directly related to this capacity. In particular, the addition of an <b>arbitrary</b> large <b>number</b> to any RAM belonging to this class gives it the ability to recognise any recursively enumerable set in O(1) time. Indeed, functions computable in this model are on the second level of the arithmetical hierarchy. When adding to this the ability to generate additional <b>arbitrary</b> large <b>numbers</b> at will, we show that an O(1) -time computation has the same power as the entire arithmetical hierarchy, and an omega(1) -time computation extends even beyond that. For certain other RAMs, we are able to show that the addition of <b>arbitrary</b> large <b>numbers</b> does not increase their computational power at all. For RAMs that have access to random numbers, we close an open problem raised by Simon (1981), who asked for a characterisation of the power of certain RAMs working in polynomial time on random numbers. Intriguingly, the power of these RAMs is PEL, too. However, it remains an open question whether they, too, enjoy the power-boost afforded by <b>arbitrary</b> large <b>numbers.</b> Awards: Winner of the Mollie Holman Doctoral Medal for Excellence, Faculty of Information Technology, [2013]...|$|R
