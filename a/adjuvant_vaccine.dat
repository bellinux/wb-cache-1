This encourages an extended duration of the drug’s effects (namely, reduction of active/unbound GnRH in the animal’s system). Though the endocrinology behind Gonacon is sound, the need for multiple lifetime doses for full efficacy make it a less-guaranteed and less-permanent solution for wildlife than lethal culls. Even among domestic animals in controlled conditions, Gonacon cannot ensure 100% reduction in the occurrence of pregnancies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Although {{seasonal}} influenza vaccine {{is effective in}} the elderly, immune responses to vaccination are lower in the elderly than in younger adults. Strategies to optimise responses to vaccination in the elderly include using an <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> or using an intradermal vaccination route. The immunogenicity of an intradermal {{seasonal influenza}} vaccine was {{compared with that of}} an <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> in the elderly. Methods Elderly volunteers (age ≥ 65 years) were randomised to receive a single dose of trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine: either a split-virion vaccine containing 15 μg haemagglutinin [HA]/strain/ 0. 1 -ml dose administered intradermally, or a subunit vaccine (15 μg HA/strain/ 0. 5 -ml dose) adjuvanted with MF 59 C. 1 and administered intramuscularly. Blood samples were taken before and 21 ± 3 days post-vaccination. Anti-HA antibody titres were assessed using haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and single radial haemolysis (SRH) methods. We aimed to show that the intradermal vaccine was non-inferior to the <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Results A total of 795 participants were enrolled (intradermal vaccine n = 398; <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> n = 397). Non-inferiority of the intradermal vaccine was demonstrated for the A/H 1 N 1 and B strains, but not for the A/H 3 N 2 strain (upper bound of the 95 % CI = 1. 53) using the HI method, and for all three strains by the SRH method. A post-hoc analysis of covariance to adjust for baseline antibody titres demonstrated the non-inferiority of the intradermal vaccine by HI and SRH methods for all three strains. Both vaccines were, in general, well tolerated; the incidence of injection-site reactions was higher for the intradermal (70. 1 %) than the <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> (33. 8 %) but these reactions were mild and of short duration. Conclusions The immunogenicity and safety of the intradermal seasonal influenza vaccine in the elderly was comparable with that of the <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Intradermal vaccination to target the immune properties of the skin appears to be an appropriate strategy to address the challenge of declining immune responses in the elderly.

40|$|Since initial {{reports in}} April 2009, the {{pandemic}} influenza A (H 1 N 1) virus has spread globally. Influenza vaccines {{are the primary}} method for the control of influenza and its complications. We conducted a multicenter clinical trial to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of H 1 N 1 vaccine (Green Cross Co.) in young adults (18 to 64 years) and the elderly (> 65 years) using a two-dose regimen, with the doses administered 21 days apart. Three different regimens of hemagglutinin antigen were comparatively analyzed: 3. 75 g (MF 59 adjuvanted) versus 7. 5 g (MF 59 adjuvanted) versus 15 g (nonadjuvanted) in young adults and 3. 75 g (MF 59 adju-vanted) versus 7. 5 g (MF 59 adjuvanted) in the elderly. In young adults, all three vaccine regimens met the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMA) criteria after the first dose. In the elderly, on day 21 after the first dose, the rates of seroprotection and seroconversion were significantly higher for the 7. 5 -g dose of MF 59 <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> than for the 3. 75 -g dose (58. 0 % versus 44. 3 % [P 0. 03] and 53. 7 % versus 37. 2 % [P < 0. 01], respectively).

40|$|Introduction In 2009 {{there was}} a {{pandemic}} of a new influenza virus: 2009 A (H 1 N 1) influenza virus. Pregnant women in the Netherlands were vaccinated against this virus with an <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine.</b> <b>Adjuvants</b> have proinflammatory properties that could theoretically induce preeclampsia in pregnant women. The safety of <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccines</b> during pregnancy has not been tested in clinical trials. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the safety of <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccines</b> during pregnancy by looking at the pregnancy outcome preeclampsia. The research question is: "Are pregnant women with preeclampsia more often vaccinated against 2009 A (H 1 N 1) influenza with an <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> compared to pregnant women without preeclampsia?" Methods This was a retrospective case-control study. The study participants had all given birth in the UMCG and were pregnant at the time the vaccination took place: they gave birth after November 8, 2009 and were aterm before November 19, 2010. The women in the patient group were diagnosed with preeclampsia or HELLP during pregnancy. The women in the control group had had a normal pregnancy. Of the patient and control group demographic data, medical history, obstetric data, neonate data and data about vaccination were collected. In this study we examined the outcome variable preeclampsia/HELLP and the determinant vaccinated with 2009 A (H 1 N 1) influenza vaccination. Results There was no significant difference (p< 0. 05) between the patient and control group regarding the percentage vaccinated against 2009 A (H 1 N 1) influenza virus (p= 0. 611). Our study showed that within the preeclampsiagroup a higher percentage of patients with late preeclampsia/HELLP had been vaccinated, compared to women with early preeclampsia/HELLP. After correction for confounders it showed that 2009 A (H 1 N 1) influenza vaccination had no significant influence to preeclampsia/HELLP (p= 0. 644; odds ratio 1. 228; 95 % confidence interval 0. 514 - 2. 930) Conclusion In conclusion, pregnant women with preeclampsia were not more often vaccinated against 2009 A (H 1 N 1) influenza virus with an <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> than pregnant women without preeclamspia. Within the preeclampsiapatientgroup there are indications that patients with late preeclampsia are more often vaccinated against 2009 A (H 1 N 1) influenza virus than patients with early preeclampsia. A study with a larger population could look into this specifically because this is a possible indication that a <b>vaccine</b> with an <b>adjuvant</b> that is given from the second trimester of pregnancy could have a potential effect on the pregnancy outcome preeclampsia. ...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{propensity}} for influenza viruses to mutate and recombine makes them both a familiar threat and a prototype emerging infectious disease. Emerging {{evidence suggests that}} the use of MF 59 -adjuvanted vaccines in older adults and young children enhances protection against influenza infection and reduces adverse influenza-attributable outcomes compared to unadjuvanted vaccines. The health and economic impact of such vaccines in the Canadian population are uncertain. METHODS: We constructed an age-structured compartmental model simulating the transmission of influenza in the Canadian population over a ten-year period. We compared projected health outcomes (quality-adjusted life years (QALY) lost), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for three strategies: (i) current use of unadjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine; (ii) use of MF 59 -adjuvanted influenza vaccine adults ≥ 65 in the Canadian population, and (iii) <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> used in both older adults and children aged < 6. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, use of <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> in older adults was highly cost-effective (ICER = $ 2111 /QALY gained), but such a program was "dominated" by a program that extended the use of <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> to include young children (ICER = $ 1612 /QALY). Results were similar whether or not a universal influenza immunization program was used in other age groups; projections were robust in the face of wide-ranging sensitivity analyses. INTERPRETATION: Based on the best available data, it is projected that replacement of traditional trivalent influenza vaccines with MF 59 -adjuvanted vaccines would confer substantial benefits to vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, and would be economically attractive relative to other widely-used preventive interventions...|$|R

The immune response administrated with half-dose of monovalent vaccine plus CVCVA 5 were higher than those of one dose of monovalent vaccine without immunopotentiators as measured by levels of antibodies from serum, tears and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, and cytokines of IFNγ and IL- 4 from serum. Vaccines included the univalent vaccine of Newcastle Disease virus (ND), Egg Drop Syndrome virus (EDS), Infectious Bronchitis virus (IB), and Infectious Bursal Disease virus (IBD).

The CVCVA 5 also boosted the immune efficacy of the tetravalent vaccine (ND-IB-EDS-H 9). A half-dose of <b>adjuvanted</b> commercial <b>vaccine</b> or 75 % antigen-sparing <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> elicited similar antibody levels to those of one dose non-adjuvanted commercial vaccines. The CVCVA 5 improved the effect of a booster vaccination as measured by the antibody levels against H 5 or H 9 virus antigens, in which chickens primed with the <b>adjuvanted</b> ND-IB <b>vaccines</b> given a booster with H 5 –H 9 bivalent vaccines without CVCVA 5 using 5 -day intervals. The inflammatory response may contribute to these additional effects by increasing the levels of IFNγ and IL- 4 after the injection of the <b>adjuvanted</b> ND-IB <b>vaccines.</b> Results indicated that the CVCVA 5 improved the serum and mucosal antibody levels, cytokine levels of the chickens given the univalent vaccine, and also improved serum antibody titers in bivalent and tetravalent vaccines. This has a potential as an improve vaccine...|$|R

Residents of 25 long-term care facilities received either the adjuvant or a non-adjuvant vaccine. The odds ratios (OR) of influenza-like illness {{were calculated for}} non-adjuvant vs. <b>adjuvant</b> <b>vaccine</b> recipients, also stratifying for chronic cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal diseases. The risk was higher for the non-adjuvant vaccine recipients and highest for those with respiratory disease (OR 2. 27, 95 % CI 1. 09 - 4. 82) and cardiovascular disease (OR 1. 88; 95 % CI 1. 31 - 2. 72). In this study the MF 59 -adjuvant vaccine provided superior clinical protection among the elderly, especially those with chronic diseases...|$|E
40|$|In {{contrast}} to adult sheep, 2 - to 3 -month-old lambs {{do not respond}} well to a single injection of Clostridium perfringens Type D oil adjuvant epsilon toxoid. This unresponsiveness can be overcome, however, by administering 2 injections of oil <b>adjuvant</b> <b>vaccine</b> or one injection of oil adjuvant followed 4 weeks later by an injection of alum-precipitated toxoid. The latter procedure evokes protective antitoxin levels which persist for 8 months, and a booster injection of alum-precipitated toxoid given at this stage results in an immunity which lasts for at least 1 year.

40|$|Background: The {{development}} of effective adjuvant therapies {{for the treatment}} of high-risk melanoma patients is critical for the prevention of metastatic disease and improvement of patient survival. Active specific immunotherapy has been tested as an adjuvant treatment in numerous dinical trials with overall limited, but occasionally promising, success rates. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) oncolysate has been utilized as an adjunctive immunotherapeutic agent in the postsurgical management of these patients. A phase II study initiated in 1975 using <b>adjuvant</b> <b>vaccine</b> therapy composed of allogeneic and autologous human melanoma cells infected with live NDV (NDV oncolysate) in patients with AJCC stage HI melanoma following therapeutic lymph node dissection has shown> 60 % survival rate at 10 years with no adverse effects. Continued long-term analysis of trials with promising early results as well as assessment of immunologic responses generated in these patients may result in improved therapeutic decisions for dinical trials in the future...|$|E
40|$|In spring 2013, human infections {{with a novel}} avian {{influenza}} A (H 7 N 9) virus were reported in China. The number of cases has increased with over 200 mortalities reported to date. However, there is currently no vaccine available for the H 7 subtype of influenza A virus. Virus-specific cellular immune responses {{play a critical role}} in virus clearance during influenza infection. In this study, we undertook a side-by-side evaluation of two different adjuvants, Salmonella typhimurium flagellin (fliC) and polyethyleneimine (PEI), through intraperitoneal administration to assess their effects on the immunogenicity of the recombinant HA 1 - 2 subunit vaccine of H 7 N 9 influenza. The fusion protein HA 1 - 2 -fliC and HA 1 - 2 combined with PEI could induce significantly higher HA 1 - 2 -specific IgG and hemagglutination inhibition titers than HA 1 - 2 alone at 12 days post-boost, with superior HA 1 - 2 specific IgG titers in the HA 1 - 2 -fliC group compared with the PEI adjuvanted group. The PEI <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> induced higher IgG 1 /IgG 2 a ratio and significantly increased numbers of IFN-γ- and IL- 4 -producing cells than HA 1 - 2 alone, suggesting a mixed Th 1 /Th 2 -type cellular immune response with a Th 2 bias. Meanwhile, the HA 1 - 2 -fliC induced higher IgG 2 a and IgG 1 levels, which is indicative of a mixed Th 1 /Th 2 -type profile. Consistent with this, significant levels, and equal numbers, of IFN-γ- and IL- 4 -producing cells were detected after HA 1 - 2 -fliC vaccination. Moreover, the marked increase in CD 69 expression and the proliferative index with the HA 1 - 2 -fliC and PEI <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccines</b> indicated that both <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> candidates effectively induced antigen-specific cellular immune responses. Taken together, our findings indicate that the two <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> candidates elicit effective and HA 1 - 2 -specific humoral and cellular immune responses, offering significant promise for the development of a successful recombinant HA 1 - 2 subunit vaccine for H 7 N 9 influenza...|$|R
