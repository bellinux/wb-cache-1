5|$|<b>A</b> <b>preoccupation</b> {{with his}} own {{mortality}} permeates Shostakovich's later works, among them the later quartets and the Fourteenth Symphony of 1969 (a song cycle based {{on a number of}} poems on the theme of death). This piece also finds Shostakovich at his most extreme with musical language, with twelve-tone themes and dense polyphony used throughout. Shostakovich dedicated this score to his close friend Benjamin Britten, who conducted its Western premiere at the 1970 Aldeburgh Festival. The Fifteenth Symphony of 1971 is, by contrast, melodic and retrospective in nature, quoting Wagner, Rossini and the composer's own Fourth Symphony.|$|E
25|$|Self-consciousness: {{an acute}} sense of self-awareness. It is <b>a</b> <b>preoccupation</b> with oneself, {{as opposed to}} the {{philosophical}} state of self-awareness, which is the awareness that one exists as an individual being; although some writers use both terms interchangeably or synonymously.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have suggested that}} Rajneesh, like other charismatic leaders, {{may have had a}} narcissistic personality. In his paper The Narcissistic Guru: A Profile of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, Ronald O. Clarke, Emeritus Professor of Religious Studies at Oregon State University, argued that Rajneesh exhibited all the typical features of narcissistic personality disorder, such as a grandiose sense of self-importance and uniqueness; <b>a</b> <b>preoccupation</b> with fantasies of unlimited success; a need for constant attention and admiration; a set of characteristic responses to threats to self-esteem; disturbances in interpersonal relationships; <b>a</b> <b>preoccupation</b> with personal grooming combined with frequent resorting to prevarication or outright lying; and a lack of empathy. Drawing on Rajneesh's reminiscences of his childhood in his book Glimpses of a Golden Childhood, he suggested that Rajneesh suffered from a fundamental lack of parental discipline, due to his growing up in the care of overindulgent grandparents. Rajneesh's self-avowed Buddha status, he concluded, was part of a delusional system associated with his narcissistic personality disorder; a condition of ego-inflation rather than egolessness.|$|E
25|$|Scott and McCrea's {{farewell}} Western {{is characterized}} by a nostalgic sense of the passing of the Old West; <b>a</b> <b>preoccupation</b> with the emotionality of male bonding and of the experiential 'gap' between the young and the old; and the fearful evocation, {{in the form of the}} Hammonds (the villains in the film), of these preoccupations transmuted into brutal and perverse forms.McCrea, like Scott, retired from filmmaking after this picture, although he returned to the screen twice in later years.|$|E
25|$|Disinterested benevolence was {{the basis}} for piety, {{according}} to the New Divinity. It originates at conversion when the Holy Spirit was believed to renew the heart so that the convert desires union with Christ through faith and embraces the way of the cross, which is self-sacrifice. In this, self-love is eliminated and the convert seeks happiness in God and his creation. For Edwards, a disinterest in one's self and <b>a</b> <b>preoccupation</b> with God's moral excellence was an indication that such a person had been regenerated. Such persons no longer worried over the status of their own souls because their love for God and the contemplation of his glory made assurance of one's salvation virtually an afterthought.|$|E
50|$|Sexual obsessions are obsessions {{with sexual}} activity. In {{the context of}} {{obsessive-compulsive}} disorder (OCD), these are extremely common, and can become extremely debilitating, making the person ashamed of the symptoms and reluctant to seek help. <b>As</b> <b>preoccupation</b> with sexual matters, however, does not only occur as a symptom of OCD, they may be enjoyable in other contexts (i.e. sexual fantasy).|$|R

25|$|In the 1930s Lewis kept Froanna in the background, {{and many}} of his friends were simply unaware of her existence. It seems that Lewis was {{extraordinarily}} jealous and protective of his wife, owing to her youth and beauty (she was eighteen years his junior). They lived together for ten years before marrying. Froanna was patient and caring toward her husband through financial troubles and his frequent illnesses. She was the model for some of Lewis’s most tender and intimate portraits, {{as well as a number}} of characters in his fiction. In contrast to his earlier, rather impersonal portraits, which are purely concerned with external appearance, the portraits of Froanna show <b>a</b> <b>preoccupation</b> with her inner life.|$|E

She was originally a columnist for Dimineața, with Pagina femeii ("The Woman's Page"); at the same time, Viața Românească serialized her biographic series Profiluri feminine ("Feminine Profiles"), later taken up by Adevărul Literar și Artistic. The latter also published her April 1928 interview with writer Sylvia Stevenson, on the state of English literature, discussing authors from Virginia Woolf to John Galsworthy (<b>a</b> <b>preoccupation</b> which resurfaced in Sadoveanu's articles as late as 1937). Sadoveanu's work for Adevărul itself originally included a series of her essays on English writers.|$|E

He also played (and {{continues}} to play) various instruments for Danielson Famile. While in his final semester at Hope College, Stevens wrote and recorded his debut solo album, A Sun Came, which he released on Asthmatic Kitty Records. He later moved to New York City, where he enrolled in a writing program at the New School for Social Research. During his time at the New School, Stevens developed <b>a</b> <b>preoccupation</b> with short story that he believed would lead him to write a novel, but ultimately returned him to songwriting.|$|E

25|$|When {{the land}} was bought, trees were planted on bare land. Today, the gardens of Girton are large {{compared}} {{to those of other}} Cambridge colleges. They became <b>a</b> <b>preoccupation</b> for the college in 1875 when Miss Davies handed over the responsibility for developing the gardens to Miss Bernard. A pond, which originated from excavations for the construction of the Stanley library and the Orchard Wing, dates from 1884. A 1983 report of the college ornithologists' society found sixty species of birds, and a moth report from 1986 recorded over 100 species. The Fellows' garden was redesigned in 1992 and hosts a green theatre. Outdoor plays are no longer performed in the Fellows' garden because of noise from the A14. A rare breed of black squirrels can sometimes be seen in Girton.|$|E
25|$|Several cultures' backstories had to {{be shown}} through only {{subliminal}} glimpses on screen, as are the miniatures, and for the Elves and Gondorians, fictional histories {{had to be}} presented within the changes of armour. The Elves have an Art Nouveau influence that involves leaves and flowers, whilst the Dwarves have <b>a</b> <b>preoccupation</b> with geometry {{that is supposed to}} remind the audience of their digging nature. The Hobbits hark back to 18th century England, the Rohirrim have numerous horse and sun motifs and draw visual inspiration from Beowulf and the Anglo-Saxon artifacts found in the Sutton Hoo burial ship, and the Gondorians reflect 16th-century German and Italian armour as well as tree motifs. The evil Haradrim Men take influence from Aztecs and Kiribati after bad feedback from Phillipa Boyens over looking African. Most of the Orc armour is sharp, reflecting secateurs, and have runes written on them to reflect a worship of Sauron.|$|E
500|$|Kenyatta was a Pan-Africanist. Assensoh {{suggested}} that Kenyatta initially had socialist inclinations but [...] "became {{a victim of}} capitalist circumstances"; conversely, Savage stated that [...] "Kenyatta's direction was hardly towards {{the creation of a}} radical new socialist society". When in power, he displayed <b>a</b> <b>preoccupation</b> with individual and mbari land rights that were at odds with any socialist-oriented collectivisation. He had been exposed to Marxist-Leninist ideas through his friendship with Padmore and the time spent in the Soviet Union, but had also been exposed to Western forms of liberal democratic government through his many years in Britain.|$|E

500|$|Historian Alan Axelrod {{wrote that}} [...] "for Patton, {{leadership}} was never simply about making plans and giving orders, {{it was about}} transforming oneself into a symbol". Patton intentionally expressed a conspicuous desire for glory, atypical of the officer corps of the day which emphasized blending in with troops on the battlefield. He was an admirer of Admiral Horatio Nelson for his actions in leading the Battle of Trafalgar in a full dress uniform. Patton had <b>a</b> <b>preoccupation</b> with bravery, wearing his rank insignia conspicuously in combat, {{and at one point}} during World War I rode atop a tank into a German-controlled village seeking to inspire courage in his men.|$|E
500|$|As an art theory, the {{progressive}} approach falls between formalism and eclecticism. [...] "Formalism" [...] refers to <b>a</b> <b>preoccupation</b> with established external compositional systems, structural unity, and {{the autonomy of}} individual art works. Like formalism, [...] "eclecticism" [...] connotates a predilection toward style synthesis or integration. However, contrary to formalist tendencies, eclecticism foregrounds discontinuities between historical and contemporary styles and electronic media, sometimes referring simultaneously to vastly different musical genres, idioms, and cultural codes. In marketing, [...] "progressive" [...] is used to distinguish a product from [...] "commercial" [...] pop music. [...] Progressive music may also be associated with auteur-stars and concept albums, considered traditional structures of the music industry.|$|E
500|$|The song's lyrical {{theme is}} reincarnation, {{in keeping with}} its composer's {{absorption}} in Hindu philosophy – <b>a</b> <b>preoccupation</b> that had led the Beatles to the Maharishi's teachings and would result in Harrison's introduction to the Hare Krishna movement in December 1968. Harrison had first taken reincarnation as his theme for [...] "Art of Dying", which he began writing in 1966, and it {{would continue to be}} the focus of many of his compositions as a solo artist, notably the 1973 hit [...] "Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)". Theologian Dale Allison highlights [...] "Circles" [...] as the only Harrison song to use the term [...] "reincarnate", however, and he also notes the composer's use of the word [...] "soul" [...] "in its proper metaphysical sense".|$|E

500|$|There is {{no doubt}} that beliefs about elves have their origins before the {{conversion}} to Christianity and associated Christianization of north-west Europe. For this reason, belief in elves has, from the Middle Ages through into recent scholarship, often been labelled [...] "pagan" [...] and a [...] "superstition". However, almost all surviving textual sources about elves were produced by Christians (whether Anglo-Saxon monks, medieval Icelandic poets, early modern ballad-singers, nineteenth-century folklore collectors, or even twentieth-century fantasy authors). Attested beliefs about elves therefore need to be understood as part of Germanic-speakers' Christian culture and not merely relic of their pre-Christian religion. Accordingly, investigating the relationship between beliefs in elves and Christian cosmology has been <b>a</b> <b>preoccupation</b> of scholarship about elves both in early times and in modern research.|$|E
500|$|The film is loosely {{connected}} to Cat People (1942) {{by the appearance}} of Tom Conway as Dr. Louis Judd, who had roles in both films. Judd recounts to a poet that he once knew a mysterious woman who was in fact a [...] "raving lunatic" [...] (referencing Irena Dubrovna, the protagonist of Cat People). In memos and early drafts of the script, Conway's character was referred to as [...] "Mr. Siegfried"; film scholars believe that the character's name was changed to provide continuity between the two films and to capitalize on Cat Peoples success. The Judd character, however, had died in Cat People, calling into question the relation of the two fictional narratives. Val Lewton historian Edmund Bansak notes that the films are also linked thematically through <b>a</b> <b>preoccupation</b> with nihilism.|$|E
500|$|Gospel poems: Throughout her life, Dickinson wrote poems {{reflecting}} <b>a</b> <b>preoccupation</b> {{with the}} teachings of Jesus Christ and, indeed, many are addressed to him. She stresses the Gospels' contemporary pertinence and recreates them, often with [...] "wit and American colloquial language". Scholar Dorothy Oberhaus finds that the [...] "salient feature uniting Christian poets ... is their reverential attention {{to the life of}} Jesus Christ" [...] and contends that Dickinson's deep structures place her in the [...] "poetic tradition of Christian devotion" [...] alongside Hopkins, Eliot and Auden. In a Nativity poem, Dickinson combines lightness and wit to revisit an ancient theme: [...] "The Savior must have been/ A docile Gentleman–/ To come so far so cold a Day/ For little Fellowmen/ The Road to Bethlehem/ Since He and I were Boys/ Was leveled, but for that twould be/ A rugged billion Miles–".|$|E
