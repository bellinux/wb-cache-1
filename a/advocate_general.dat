40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{primarily the}} role of the <b>Advocates</b> <b>General</b> of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in the post-Lisbon Treaty environment. That role has so far evolved alongside with the evolution of the CJEU itself. After providing a brief historical overview, the author focuses on the appointment of <b>Advocates</b> <b>General</b> and the composition of their cabinets, and discusses the relevance of the <b>Advocates</b> <b>General</b> in the post-Lisbon judicial architecture of the EU. The latter assumes consideration of the ongoing transformation of the EU judicial system. The second focal point of this paper is a discussion on the question whether <b>Advocates</b> <b>General</b> are still needed, and whether they shall be needed in view of the challenges the CJEU may reasonably be expected to face in the future. The reflection comprises arguments in favor and against keeping the institute of <b>Advocates</b> <b>General</b> within the CJEU structure. Upon balancing the provided arguments, it can be concluded that the mechanism of <b>Advocates</b> <b>General</b> is indispensable to the EU since its ongoing transformation requires constant creation of legal rules. The practice so far has proved the great value of <b>Advocates</b> <b>General</b> for that particular need...|$|R
2500|$|The {{judges are}} {{assisted}} by eleven <b>Advocates</b> <b>General,</b> whose number {{may be increased}} by the Council if the Court so requests. The <b>Advocates</b> <b>General</b> are responsible for presenting a legal opinion on the cases assigned to them. They can question the parties involved and then give their opinion on a legal solution to the case before the judges deliberate and deliver their judgment. The intention behind having <b>Advocates</b> <b>General</b> attached is to provide independent and impartial opinions concerning the Court's cases. Unlike the Court's judgments, the written opinions of the <b>Advocates</b> <b>General</b> are the works of a single author and are consequently generally more readable {{and deal with the}} legal issues more comprehensively than the Court, which is limited to the particular matters at hand.|$|R

5|$|In 1893, Jardine {{was called}} to the Bar by the Middle Temple in 1893. He {{returned}} to India, where he practised at the Bombay Bar until 1916. At the time, British barristers dominated the Indian legal system, finding considerable financial reward, but causing resentment among the Indian legal profession. At the same time, Jardine held positions of increasing influence in India. He was Perry Professor of Jurisprudence and Roman Law from 1898 to 1902 and then Principal of the Government Law School until 1903. Subsequently, he was Clerk of the Crown, before being appointed <b>Advocate</b> <b>General</b> of Bombay in 1915 before retiring from India in 1916.|$|E

5|$|The Australian {{military}} has been an all-volunteer force since the abolition of conscription in 1972. Both men and women can enlist in the ADF, with women being able to apply for all roles. Only Australian citizens and permanent residents who are eligible for Australian citizenship can enlist. Recruits must be aged between 17 and 55, and meet health and educational standards. The ADF {{is one of the}} few areas of the Australian Government to continue to have compulsory retirement ages: permanent personnel must retire at 60 years of age and reservists at 65. Discipline of defence personnel is guided by the Defence Force Discipline Act (1982), ultimately overseen by the Judge <b>Advocate</b> <b>General</b> of the ADF.|$|E
5|$|The verdict (8 November 2013) and {{sentence}} (6 December 2013) {{were both}} {{delivered at the}} Military Court Centre in Bulford, Wiltshire. The judge advocate (the civilian judge heading the panel at a court-martial) was Judge <b>Advocate</b> <b>General</b> Jeff Blackett. The verdict carried with it a mandatory life sentence, so {{it was only in}} the judge advocate's and court-martial board's power to decide on the minimum sentence once the board had found Blackman guilty. He was sentenced to a minimum of 10 years in prison. On 22 May 2014, at the Courts Martial Appeal Court, its most senior judge, Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, upheld the life sentence, but reduced Blackman's minimum term to 8 years.|$|E
5|$|After {{establishing}} a legal {{career in the}} field of insolvency, Stevenson served during the Second World War as a Deputy Judge <b>Advocate</b> <b>General</b> of the Armed Forces. He was subsequently Judge Advocate at the 1945 war crimes trial of former personnel of the German submarine U-852 for their actions in {{what became known as the}} Peleus affair. In 1954 Stevenson represented the government of British Kenya during Jomo Kenyatta's unsuccessful appeal against his conviction for membership of the rebel organisation Mau Mau. Later that year he represented the litigants in the Crichel Down affair, which led to changes in the law on compulsory purchase. In 1955 he defended Ruth Ellis, the last woman to be executed for murder in the United Kingdom, and two years later took part in the unsuccessful prosecution of suspected serial killer John Bodkin Adams. He was deeply distressed by the execution of Ellis, for whom there had been no defence in law, but who was expected to have been reprieved by Home Secretary Gwilym Lloyd George.|$|E

5|$|Capitol Hill {{is one of}} {{the largest}} and most densely {{populated}} neighborhoods in Washington, D.C. It is bounded by F Street NE on the north and Southeast/Southwest Freeway on the south. The U.S. Capitol marks its western boundary, while the Anacostia River is its eastern limit. Although Capitol Hill has been home to many of the city's powerful, its hauntings appear to be few. One ghost, however, is said to haunt First Street NE. Joseph Holt was Judge <b>Advocate</b> <b>General</b> of the United States Army from 1862 to 1875. He presided over the trials of the Lincoln assassination conspirators. During the trials, accused conspirators Dr. Samuel Mudd (who treated John Wilkes Booth's broken leg) and Mary Surratt (at whose downtown boarding house the conspirators met) were held at the Old Capitol Prison opposite the U.S. Capitol (the modern day United States Supreme Court Building stands on the site today). After Holt retired, he allegedly became a recluse in his Capitol Hill home. Although the Holt house no longer exists, local residents have told stories of Holt's ghost walking down First Street NE in a blue suit and cape, pondering the guilt of Mudd and Surrat as he heads for the site of the Old Capitol Prison.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, a {{board of}} five Army generals on the retired list convened under act of law to review every Army Medal of Honor awarded. The board was to report on any Medals of Honor awarded or issued for any cause other than {{distinguished}} service. The commission, led by Nelson A. Miles, identified 911 awards for causes other than distinguished service. This included the 864 medals awarded {{to members of the}} 27th Maine regiment; 29 servicemen who served as Abraham Lincoln's funeral guard; six civilians, including Mary Edwards Walker and Buffalo Bill Cody; and 12 others. Walker's medal was restored by President Jimmy Carter in 1977. Cody and four other civilian scouts who rendered distinguished service in action, and who were therefore considered by the board to have fully earned their medals, had theirs restored in 1989. The report was endorsed by the Judge <b>Advocate</b> <b>General,</b> who also advised that the War Department should not seek the return of the revoked medals from the recipients identified by the board. In the case of recipients who continued to wear the medal, the War Department was advised to take no action to enforce the statute.|$|E
5|$|Royall and Marbury envisaged {{nuclear energy}} being {{controlled}} by experts, {{with a minimum}} of political interference. The commissioners would be appointed for indefinite terms, and the President's power to remove them would be limited. They would be supported by four advisory boards, for military applications, industrial uses, research and medicine, the membership of which would be restricted to those with technical qualifications. Day-to-day running of the organization would {{be in the hands of}} an administrator and his deputy. The Royall–Marbury Bill was reviewed by the Interim Committee at its July 19 meeting and revised in line with their suggestions. After the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki lifted the veil of secrecy surrounding the Manhattan Project, Royall and Marbury were able to consult with the Attorney General, the Judge <b>Advocate</b> <b>General</b> and the Office of Scientific Research and Development. The draft was sent to the President in August for circulation among, and comment from, affected government agencies. Only the State Department had objections, on the basis that it was still involved in trying to hammer out an international agreement on nuclear energy.|$|E

25|$|The {{opinions}} of the Advocates General are advisory and do not bind the Court, but they are nonetheless very influential and are followed {{in the majority of}} cases.
