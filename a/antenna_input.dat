The exact quality factor (), computed indirectly from the <b>antenna’s</b> <b>input</b> reactance and far field, is compared to twice the inverse of the matched half-power VSWR bandwidth (BW) and to an approximate quality factor () determined from the frequency derivative of the <b>antenna’s</b> <b>input</b> impedance. The well-established approximate equalities BW for antennas exhibiting an isolated single impedance resonance within their operating band are shown to become highly inaccurate for an electrically small antenna exhibiting two closely spaced impedance resonances.

Multiple antennas may be spread over the user platform and provide signals required for the platform attitude estimation or may be arranged in an antenna array to be used together with array processing algorithms for improving signal reception, e. g. for multipath and interference mitigation.

40|$|Depending on {{the basis}} used for comparison, it is {{possible}} to predict different gains when applying carrier arraying to a conventional coherent receiver. In the past, the specific performance comparisons were made between the arrayed and nonarrayed cases assuming a fixed carrier-tracking closed-loop bandwidth. While the notion of loop bandwidth for the nonarrayed loop with a single input is well defined and meaningful, the comparable notion for an arrayed loop with multiple inputs is not uniquely defined since it depends on the knowledge of the statistical relation, e. g., degree of correlation, among the various <b>antenna</b> <b>inputs.</b> To circumvent the need for such knowledge, which is often not completely available, we suggest in this article an alternate criterion for comparing arrayed and nonarrayed loops, namely, fixed steady-state phase error, which, in the arrayed case, is independent of the statistical relation among the <b>antenna</b> <b>inputs.</b> We show that, in this case, the gain derived from carrier arraying is quite different from that obtained under the assumption of fixed-loop bandwidth, which suggests that one should exercise care when comparing arrayed and unarrayed loops in that the criterion used for comparison should be directly applicable to the situation at hand...|$|R
