The upper limit of the effective O H number density sug-gested by the observations is at the most one fifth of that predicted by Levy. I t ap-pears that the reconversion of HO, to OH radicals is not as effective as assumed in the model. Calculations are presented for the loss of radicals to aerosol particles.

40|$|A global {{three-dimensional}} model {{is used to}} investigate the transport and tropospheric residence time of Pb- 210, an aerosol tracer produced in the atmosphere by radioactive decay of Rn- 222 emitted from soils. The model uses meteorological input with 4 deg x 5 deg horizontal resolution and 4 -hour temporal resolution from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies general circulation model (GCM). It computes <b>aerosol</b> <b>scavenging</b> by convective precipitation {{as part of the}} wet convective mass transport operator in order to capture the coupling between vertical transport and rainout. Scavenging in convective precipitation accounts for 74 % of the global Pb- 210 sink in the model; scavenging in large-scale precipitation accounts for 12 %, and scavenging in dry deposition accounts for 14 %. The model captures 63 % of the variance of yearly mean Pb- 210 concentrations measured at 85 sites around the world with negligible mean bias, lending support to the computation of <b>aerosol</b> <b>scavenging.</b> There are, however, a number of regional and seasonal discrepancies that reflect in part anomalies in GCM precipitation. Computed residence times with respect to deposition for Pb- 210 aerosol in the tropospheric column are about 5 days at southern midlatitudes and 10 - 15 days in the tropics; values at northern midlatitudes vary from about 5 days in winter to 10 days in summer. The residence time of Pb- 210 produced in the lowest 0. 5 km of atmosphere is on average four times shorter than that of Pb- 210 produced in the upper atmosphere. Both model and observations indicate a weaker decrease of Pb- 210 concentrations between the continental mixed layer and the free troposphere than is observed for total aerosol concentrations; an explanation is that Rn- 222 is transported to high altitudes in wet convective updrafts, while aerosols and soluble precursors of <b>aerosols</b> are <b>scavenged</b> by precipitation in the updrafts. Thus Pb- 210 is not simply a tracer of aerosols produced in the continental boundary layer, but also of aerosols derived from insoluble precursors emitted from the surface of continents. One may draw an analogy between Pb- 210 and nitrate, whose precursor NO(sub x) is sparingly soluble, and explain in this manner the strong correlation observed between nitrate and Pb- 210 concentrations over the oceans...|$|R
40|$|An {{explicit}} and detailed representation of in-droplet and in-crystal aerosol particles in stratiform clouds {{has been introduced}} in the global aerosol-climate model ECHAM 5 -HAM. The new scheme allows {{an evaluation of the}} cloud cycling of aerosols and an estimation of the relative contributions of nucleation and collision scavenging, as opposed to evaporation of hydrometeors in the global aerosol processing by clouds. On average an aerosol particle is cycled through stratiform clouds 0. 5 times. The new scheme leads to important changes in the simulated fraction of <b>aerosol</b> <b>scavenged</b> in clouds, and consequently in the aerosol wet deposition. In general, less <b>aerosol</b> is <b>scavenged</b> into clouds with the new prognostic treatment than what is prescribed in standard ECHAM 5 -HAM. Aerosol concentrations, size distributions, scavenged fractions and cloud droplet concentrations are evaluated and compared to different observations. While the scavenged fraction and the aerosol number concentrations in the marine boundary layer are well represented in the new model, aerosol optical thickness, cloud droplet number concentrations in the marine boundary layer and the aerosol volume in the accumulation and coarse modes over the oceans are overestimated. Sensitivity studies suggest that a better representation of below-cloud scavenging, higher in-cloud collision coefficients, or a reduced water uptake by seasalt aerosols could reduce these biases...|$|R
40|$|An {{explicit}} and detailed treatment of cloud-borne particles {{allowing for the}} consideration of aerosol cycling in clouds has been implemented into COSMO-Model, the regional weather forecast and climate model of the Consortium for Small-scale Modeling (COSMO). The effects of <b>aerosol</b> <b>scavenging,</b> cloud microphysical processing and regeneration upon cloud evaporation on the aerosol population and on subsequent cloud formation are investigated. For this, two-dimensional idealized simulations of moist flow over two bell-shaped mountains were carried out varying the treatment of <b>aerosol</b> <b>scavenging</b> and regeneration processes for a warm-phase and a mixed-phase orographic cloud. The results allowed us to identify different aerosol cycling mechanisms. In the simulated non-precipitating warm-phase cloud, aerosol mass is incorporated into cloud droplets by activation scavenging and released back to the atmosphere upon cloud droplet evaporation. In the mixed-phase cloud, a first cycle comprises cloud droplet activation and evaporation via the Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen (WBF) process. A second cycle includes below-cloud scavenging by precipitating snow particles and snow sublimation and {{is connected to the}} first cycle via the riming process which transfers aerosol mass from cloud droplets to snowflakes. In the simulated mixed-phase cloud, only a negligible part of the total aerosol mass is incorporated into ice crystals. Sedimenting snowflakes reaching the surface remove aerosol mass from the atmosphere. The results show that aerosol processing and regeneration lead to a vertical redistribution of aerosol mass and number. Thereby, the processes impact the total aerosol number and mass and additionally alter the shape of the aerosol size distributions by enhancing the internally mixed/soluble Aitken and accumulation mode and generating coarse-mode particles. Concerning subsequent cloud formation at the second mountain, accounting for aerosol processing and regeneration increases the cloud droplet number concentration with possible implications for the ice crystal number concentration...|$|R

The analysis of radioactive <b>aerosol</b> <b>scavenged</b> by rain after the Chernobyl accident highlights certain differences between the modelling studies and the environmental measurements.

In this paper, attention is first focused on the efficiency with which aerosol particles in the accumulation mode are collected by raindrops with a diameter of 2 mm.

In the experimental conditions the thermo- and diffusiophoretic forces are the only ones that can determine the <b>scavenging</b> of the <b>aerosol.</b> The research is finalized to help solve the open question concerning the contribution of thermo- and diffusiophoretic forces in <b>aerosol</b> <b>scavenging</b> process due to cloud droplets. Although earlier theoretical and experimental papers have addressed this problem, the results are contradictory and inconclusive. As phoretic forces depend on aerosol diameter and water vapour pressure gradient, experiments were performed by changing the aerosol diameter (range 0. 4. μm- 2. μm) and the water vapour gradient. The experimental results show a prevalence of the diffusiophoretic over thermophoretic force, for the considered aerosol. The measured values of the particle velocities due to phoretic forces increase with increasing aerosol diameter and vapour pressure gradient. © 2013 Elsevier B. V.

Vertical turbulence does not influence the theoretical formulation of Λ (r), but contributed to the field-generated Λ (r) due to its influence on the overall concentration changes of aerosol particles in the layers undergoing impaction scavenging. A detailed one-dimensional cloud microphysics model is used to simulate rain production and below-cloud particle scavenging, and to quantify the contribution of turbulent diffusion to the overall Λ (r) generated from concentration changes. The relative contribution of vertical diffusion to below-cloud scavenging {{is found to be}} largest for submicron particles under weak precipitation conditions. The discrepancies between theoretical and field Λ (r) values can largely be explained by the contribution of vertical diffusion for all particles larger than 0. 01 μm in diameter for which field data were available.

40|$|International audienceThe Model of Multiphase Cloud Chemistry M 2 C 2 has {{recently}} been extended to account for nucleation <b>scavenging</b> of <b>aerosol</b> particles in the cloud water chemical composition. This extended version {{has been applied to}} multiphase measurements available at the Puy de Dôme station for typical wintertime anthropogenic air masses. The simulated ion concentrations in cloud water are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data. The analysis of the sources of the chemical species in cloud water shows an important contribution from nucleation scavenging of particles which prevails for nitrate, sulphate and ammonium. Moreover, the simulation shows that iron, which comes only from the dissolution of aerosol particles in cloud water, has a significant contribution in the hydroxyl radical production. Finally, the simulated phase partitioning of chemical species in cloud are compared with measurements. Numerical results show an underestimation of interstitial particulate phase fraction with respect to the measurements, which could be due to an overestimation of activated mass by the model. However, the simulated number scavenging efficiency of particles agrees well with the measured value of 40 % of total number of aerosol particles activated in cloud droplets.

40|$|Historical {{changes of}} global {{precipitation}} in the 20 th century simulated by a climate model are investigated. The results simulated with alternate configurations of cloud microphysics are analyzed {{in the context}} of energy balance controls on global precipitation, where the latent heat changes associated with the precipitation change is nearly balanced with changes to atmospheric radiative cooling. The atmospheric radiative cooling is dominated by its clear-sky component, which is found to correlate with changes to both column water vapor and aerosol optical depth (AOD). The water vapor-dependent component of the clear-sky radiative cooling is then found to scale with global temperature change through the Clausius–Clapeyron relationship. This component results in a tendency of global precipitation increase with increasing temperature at a rate of approximately 2 %K− 1. Another component of the clear-sky radiative cooling, which is well correlated with changes to AOD, is also found to vary in magnitude among different scenarios with alternate configurations of cloud microphysics that controls the precipitation efficiency, a major factor influencing the <b>aerosol</b> <b>scavenging</b> process that can lead to different aerosol loadings. These results propose how different characteristics of cloud microphysics can cause different aerosol loadings that in turn perturb global energy balance to significantly change global precipitation.

The simulated aerosol fields are compared with Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) by P. Ginoux in this session. The main focus is how ventilation of the assimilation winds will impact the simulated aerosol vertical distribution. Excessive ventilation would transport too much aerosol in the upper troposphere and lead to errors in the long range transport as well as errors in any radiative forcing calculations derived from the simulated aerosol fields. Simulated aerosol fields using GEOS- 1 DAS wind fields for September 1994 will be compared with lidar observations during the Lidar In-space Technology Experiment (LITE).

The experiment took place from 20 June to 10 July 2007 in southern France. The results are based on three case studies with measurements coincident to CALIOP observations: the first case study illustrates a large-scale pollution event with an aerosol optical thickness at 532 nm (τa 532) of ∼ 0. 25, and the two other case studies are devoted to background conditions due to <b>aerosol</b> <b>scavenging</b> by storms with τa 532 < 0. 1.

The cloud droplet number concentration is diagnosed empirically from field experiment datasets over land and ocean that observe droplet number and all three aerosol types simultaneously; corrections are made for implied variations in cloud turbulence levels. The resulting cloud droplet number is used to calculate variations in droplet effective radius, which in turn allows us to predict aerosol effects on cloud optical thickness and microphysical process rates. We calculate the aerosol indirect effect by differencing the top-of-the-atmosphere net cloud radiative forcing for simulations with present-day vs. pre-industrial emissions. Both the first (radiative) and second (microphysical) indirect effects are explored. We test the sensitivity of our results to cloud parameterization assumptions that control the vertical distribution of cloud occurrence, the autoconversion rate, and the <b>aerosol</b> <b>scavenging</b> rate, each of which feeds back significantly on the model aerosol burden. The global mean aerosol indirect effect for all three aerosol types ranges from - 1. 55 to - 4. 36 W m(exp - 2) in our simulations.

The advection of desertic aerosols by air mass flux from West Africa to the Atlantic enriches {{the surface of the}} ocean in nutrients through atmospheric deposition. It has been shown that dust deposition is seasonal and in opposite phase between the eastern and the western Tropical Atlantic. This seasonality is driven by processes distributing the aerosol through the atmosphere over the continent and by other processes involved in the atmosphere-land-sea interactions. We used the LMD General Circulation Model in a West Africa regional configuration to investigate the processes at work in the fate of dusts. We quantify the atmospheric dust dry and wet deposition respectively in winter and boreal summer for the year 2006. In these estimates, we use simulations with <b>aerosols</b> <b>scavenged</b> by convection or convective features and large-scale precipitations.

Sensitivity studies are presented, which compare aerosol concentrations, and deposition between a variety of in-cloud scavenging approaches, including prescribed fractions, several diagnostic schemes, and a prognostic aerosol cloud processing treatment that passes aerosol in-droplet and in-ice crystal concentrations between model time steps. For one sensitivity study, assuming 100 % of the in-cloud <b>aerosol</b> is <b>scavenged</b> into the cloud droplets and ice crystals, the annual global mean accumulation mode number burden is decreased by 65 %, relative to a simulation with prognostic aerosol cloud processing. Diagnosing separate nucleation <b>scavenging</b> ratios for <b>aerosol</b> number and mass distributions, as opposed to equating the <b>aerosol</b> mass <b>scavenging</b> to the number scavenging ratios, reduces the annual global mean sulfate burden by near to 10 %.

HCl was not detected, but we determined the most stringent upper limits so far, improving on previous studies by two orders of magnitude. If HCl is assumed to be uniformly mixed, with a constant volume mixing ratio above the 1 mbar pressure level and has zero abundance below, we obtain a 3 -σ upper limit of 0. 061 ppb; in contrast, if we assume uniform mixing above the 1 mbar level and allow a non-zero but downward-decreasing abundance from 1 mbar to the troposphere based on eddy diffusion, we obtain a 3 -σ upper limit of 0. 027 ppb. This is below the abundance expected for a solar composition cometary source and implies that upper stratospheric HCl loss processes are required for consistency with observations of the external oxygen flux. We investigated loss via <b>aerosol</b> <b>scavenging</b> using a simple diffusion model and conclude that it could be a very effective mechanism for HCl removal. Transient scavenging by stratospheric NH 3 from impacts is another potentially important loss mechanism.

For an accurate description of <b>aerosol</b> <b>scavenging</b> and ice nucleation in contact mode, collision efficiency between droplets and aerosol particles {{needs to be}} known. This study derives the collision rate from experimental contact freezing data obtained with the ETH CoLlision Ice Nucleation CHamber (CLINCH). Freely falling 80 μm diameter water droplets are exposed to an aerosol consisting of 200 and 400 nm diameter silver iodide particles of concentrations from 500 to 5000 and 500 to 2000 cm − 3, respectively, which act as ice nucleating particles in contact mode. The experimental data used to derive collision efficiency are in a temperature range of 238 – 245 K, where each collision of silver iodide particles with droplets can be assumed to result in the freezing of the droplet. An upper and lower limit of collision efficiency is also estimated for 800 nm diameter kaolinite particles. The chamber is kept at ice saturation at a temperature range of 236 to 261 K, leading to the slow evaporation of water droplets giving rise to thermophoresis and diffusiophoresis. Droplets and particles bear charges inducing electrophoresis. The experimentally derived collision efficiency values of 0. 13, 0. 07 and 0. 047 – 0. 11 for 200, 400 and 800 nm particles are around 1 order of magnitude higher than theoretical formulations which include Brownian diffusion, impaction, interception, thermophoretic, diffusiophoretic and electric forces. This discrepancy is most probably due to uncertainties and inaccuracies {{in the description of}} thermophoretic and diffusiophoretic processes acting together.

Our results show that while uncertainties in the representation of in-cloud scavenging processes can lead to differences in the range of 20 – 30 % for the predicted annual, global mean aerosol mass burdens, and near to 50 % for accumulation mode aerosol number burden, the differences in predicted aerosol mass concentrations can be up to one order of magnitude, particularly for regions of the middle troposphere with temperatures below 273 K where mixed and ice phase clouds exist. Different parameterizations for impaction scavenging changed the predicted global, annual mean number removal attributed to ice clouds by seven-fold, and the global, annual dust mass removal attributed to impaction by two orders of magnitude.

A marked seasonal pattern is observed in the occurrence of the different clusters, with fast westerly and northerly Atlantic flows during winter and weak circulation flows in summer. Spring and fall were characterised by advection of moderate flows from northeastern and eastern Europe. Significant inter-cluster differences were observed for concentrations of receptor aerosol components, with the highest concentrations of EC, OC, SO 42 −, K+ and 210 Pb associated with local and mesoscale aerosol sources located over central Europe related to enhanced photochemical processes. Emissions produced by fossil fuel and biomass burning processes from the Baltic countries, Byelorussia, western regions of Russia and Kazakhstan in spring and fall also contribute to elevated levels of EC, OC, SO 42 −, K+ and 210 Pb. In the summer period long-range transport episodes of mineral dust from North-African deserts were also frequently detected, which caused elevated concentrations of coarse Ca 2 + at sites. The baseline aerosol concentrations in central Europe at the high altitude background sites were registered in winter, {{with the exception of}} coarse Na+. While the relatively high concentrations of Na+ can be explained by sea salt advected from the Atlantic, the low levels of other aerosol components are caused by efficient <b>aerosol</b> <b>scavenging</b> associated to advections of Atlantic air masses, as well as lower emissions of these species over the Atlantic compared to those over the European continent and very limited vertical air mass exchange over the continent...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA new {{formulation}} of <b>aerosol</b> <b>scavenging</b> by convective precipitations, {{consistent with the}} Emanuel convective mass-flux scheme, is implemented into the Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique general circulation model, LMDz. The aerosols 210 Pb and 7 Be are used as inert tracers to evaluate LMDz performance in terms of atmospheric transport in the tropics. Wind fields are calculated over 2007 in a regular grid with a resolution of 1. 875 ° in longitude, 1. 24 ° in latitude and 40 vertical levels. The {{first part of the}} paper addresses the sensitivity of LMDz simulations to convective schemes and to scavenging parameterizations. Results are analyzed at two tropical stations and one mid-latitude station by comparing simulated aerosol concentrations with available data, collected at surface stations. On a daily scale, the observed variations of concentrations are poorly reproduced by any considered model at both tropical stations. Nevertheless, fluctuations at timescales longer than a few days may be captured over periods of a few weeks to a few months by the new formulation. The second part of this paper focuses on the new implemented parameterization of convective scavenging. The objective is to interpret mismatches of simulated concentrations with observed data and to determine which transport mechanisms are responsible for peaks of 7 Be concentrations recorded at tropical stations. Typical meteorological situations in Polynesia are analyzed in view of convective transport and scavenging of 7 Be. In particular, the sensitivity to the location of the South Pacific Convergence Zone is examined on concentrations in Polynesia. Results demonstrate that 7 Be plumes are brought downward in the middle atmosphere by large-scale subsidence associated to the subtropical jet, in a 35 °– 25 °S band. At surface, 7 Be plumes are associated either to shallow convection or to deep convection with moderate precipitations. Within moderate convective events, surface concentrations are enhanced by surface release due to re-evaporation of precipitations. Most 7 Be surface plumes reaching the Polynesian stations are produced locally in the neighborhood of stations and advected over one or two days by surface large-scale winds. The largest mismatches may be attributed to uncertainties in the simulation of precipitations within deep convective cloud systems that develop along troughs...|$|R
40|$|The {{nature and}} {{mechanism}} of chemical elements distribution among 3 phases, atmospheric air, aerosol particle and snow, were studied on the Mizuho Plateau and the inland area toward Dome Station, in the summer, December, 1992 to January, 1993. Aerosols and acid gases were sampled {{by the use}} of an air filtering system consisting of a 1 -stage of 0. 2 μm Nuclepore Filter with 3 successive stages of alkali-impregnated filter paper at 5 locations where the fresh drifting snow was also sampled. The chemical species studied were Cl^-, NO_ 2 ^-, NO_ 3 ^-, SO_ 3 ^, SO_ 4 ^, MSA, Na^+, K^+, and NH_ 4 ^+ using an ion chromatograph. At the point nearest the ocean, S 16,atmospheric concentrations of gaseous acids (HCl, HNO_ 2,HNO_ 3 and SO_ 2) are quite high and far exceed those of aerosols, especially for Cl^-, NO_ 3 ^- and SO_ 3 ^ (determined as SO_ 4 ^). However, at inland stations, gaseous concentrations fall to lower levels than those of aerosols, which also decrease inland. This behavior suggests that the source of these gaseous species is at the sea shore or at the sea surface and they are transformed to aerosol particles by condensation and/or scavenging in a short time. In many cases, the concentrations of most chemical species in aerosols show a linear relationship to those in fresh snow. This suggests possible <b>scavenging</b> of <b>aerosol</b> particles with the same efficiency irrespective of particle size, and leads to a plausible conclusion that all concentrations as well as the composition observed in ancient ice reflect those of aerosols in the ancient atmosphere. However, in some cases, the above relationship tends to disappear, even at the same position, after few days. The factor which controls the mechanism of <b>aerosol</b> <b>scavenging</b> by snow particles is not clear; more observations are needed. The fresh drifting snow sampling was also carried out on a foot traverse from the base camp, close to the coast of the Weddell Sea, to South Pole Station. The distribution of chemical elements in fresh drifting snow showed a shift to the inland-type distribution at altitudes higher than 2500 m as had been observed on the Mizuho Plateau...|$|R
40|$|The {{uncertainties}} {{associated with}} the wet removal of aerosols entrained above convective cloud bases are investigated in a global aerosol-climate model (ECHAM 5 -HAM) under a set of limiting assumptions for the wet removal of the entrained aerosols. The limiting assumptions for the wet removal of entrained <b>aerosols</b> are negligible <b>scavenging</b> and vigorous scavenging (either through activation, with size-dependent impaction scavenging, or with the prescribed fractions of the standard model). To facilitate this process-based study, an explicit representation of cloud-droplet-borne and ice-crystal-borne aerosol mass and number, {{for the purpose of}} wet removal, is introduced into the ECHAM 5 -HAM model. This replaces and is compared with the prescribed cloud-droplet-borne and ice-crystal-borne <b>aerosol</b> fraction <b>scavenging</b> scheme of the standard model. A 20 % to 35 % uncertainty in simulated global, annual mean aerosol mass burdens and optical depth (AOD) is attributed to different assumptions for the wet removal of aerosols entrained above convective cloud bases. Assumptions about the removal of aerosols entrained above convective cloud bases control modeled upper tropospheric aerosol concentrations by as much as one order of magnitude. Simulated aerosols entrained above convective cloud bases contribute 20 % to 50 % of modeled global, annual mean aerosol mass convective wet deposition (about 5 % to 10 % of the total dry and wet deposition), depending on the aerosol species, when including wet scavenging of those entrained aerosols (either by activation, size-dependent impaction, or with the prescribed fraction scheme). Among the simulations, the prescribed fraction and size-dependent impaction schemes yield the largest global, annual mean aerosol mass convective wet deposition (by about two-fold). However, the prescribed fraction scheme has more vigorous convective mixed-phase wet removal (by two to five-fold relative to the size-dependent impaction scheme) since nearly all entrained accumulation and coarse mode aerosols are assumed to be cloud-droplet borne or ice-crystal borne, and evaporation due to the Bergeron-Findeisen process is neglected. The simulated convective wet scavenging of entrained accumulation and coarse mode aerosols has feedbacks on new particle formation and the number of Aitken mode aerosols, which control stratiform and convective cloud droplet number concentrations and yield precipitation changes in the ECHAM 5 -HAM model. However, the geographic distribution of aerosol annual mean convective wet deposition change in the model is driven by changes to the assumptions regarding the <b>scavenging</b> of <b>aerosols</b> entrained above cloud bases rather than by precipitation changes, except for sea salt deposition in the tropics. Uncertainty in the seasonal, regional cycles of AOD due to assumptions about entrained <b>aerosol</b> wet <b>scavenging</b> is similar in magnitude to the estimated error in the AOD retrievals. The uncertainty in aerosol concentrations, burdens, and AOD attributed to different assumptions for the wet <b>scavenging</b> of <b>aerosols</b> entrained above convective cloud bases in a global model motivates the ongoing need to better understand and model the activation and impaction processes that aerosols undergo after entrainment into convective updrafts...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDuring {{the second}} Specific Observing Period (SOP) of the African Monsoon Multidisplinary Analyses (AMMA) campaign, several intense {{mesoscale}} convective systems (MCS) developed over Niger. An examination {{of a particular}} convective storm simulated with a mesoscale model near Banizoumbou, Niger, on 1 July, 2006, shows that this MCS generates a strong emission of dust particles {{at the leading edge}} of its density current. A fraction of these dust aerosols are uplifted by the convective core of the system and redistributed by aqueous processes. <b>Aerosol</b> impaction <b>scavenging</b> is the main process by which particles are deposited within the mesoscale convective system. However, small particles (smaller than 1 μm) that are not efficiently scavenged, are able to reach the upper troposphere at a concentration of 6 particles per cm 3. This suggests that deep convection over semi-arid regions is able to create its own ice nuclei in high concentrations. This leads to the question: can deep convection over semi-arid regions affect particular ice properties such as ice anvil extension or induce possible feedbacks of dust on precipitation through ice sedimentation...|$|R
40|$|Synoptic {{variations}} {{associated with}} changes in satellite-derived cloud droplet number concentrations (Nd) for the southeast Pacific stratocumulus deck were examined using a composite analysis applied to daily values from the five October months of 2001, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. MAX and MIN Nd composites were defined by {{the top and bottom}} terciles of daily area-mean Nd values over the Arica Bight, the region with the largest mean oceanic Nd. Nd and ship-based accumulation mode aerosol concentrations (Na) correlate well (r= 0. 65), with a best-fit aerosol activation value dln Nddln Na of 0. 53 for pixels with Nd> 50 cm&minus; 3 . The adiabatically-derived MODIS cloud depths also correlate well with the ship-based cloud depths (r= 0. 7), though are consistently higher (mean bias of almost 60 m). The MAX-Nd composite is characterized by a weaker subtropical anticyclone and weaker winds both at the surface and the lower free troposphere than the MIN-Nd composite. The MAX-Nd composite clouds over the Arica Bight are thinner than the MIN-Nd composite clouds, have lower cloud tops, and occur within warmer, drier free tropospheres (as deduced from radiosondes) that imply greater coastal subsidence. The cloud thinning compensates radiatively for increased reflectance from increases in Nd, most apparent near the coast. CloudSat radar reflectivities do not imply significant <b>aerosol</b> <b>scavenging</b> by precipitation near the coast, indicating that variability in wind transport contributes to the aerosol variability. The co-occurrence of more boundary-layer aerosol/higher Nd within a more stable atmosphere suggests a boundary layer source for the aerosol, rather than the free troposphere. Along 85 &deg; W, the top-of-atmosphere shortwave fluxes are significantly higher (~ 50 %) for the MAX-Nd composite than for the MIN-Nd composite, with thicker clouds and higher cloud fractions. The change in Nd at this location is small (though positive), so that the composite difference primarily reflects synoptic changes. A one-point spatial correlation map reveals anomalous northerly winds at 850 hPa account for an anomalous warm temperature advection. The increase in the static stability along 85 &deg; W is highly correlated to the increased cloud fraction, despite accompanying weaker free tropospheric subsidence. This synoptic impact on offshore cloud properties is arguably our most radiatively important finding, and draws attention to the free tropospheric meridional flow as a meteorological control...|$|R

40|$|It {{is shown}} {{that the effects of}} {{radiative}} heating or cooling can have a substantial influence on the mass budget of a cloud droplet and thus on the microphysical properties of a cloud as a whole. The radiative transfer equation, including all orders of multiple scattering, is solved for spectral windows of earth's atmosphere by adopting the Eddington approximation and assuming that the cloud is isothermal and illuminated by fluxes from both the ground and the sky. The results obtained for the 8 - 12 -micron window indicate that radiative cooling can increase a droplet's growth rate and may also make the droplet cooler than the surrounding gas while water vapor is diffusing in, which would cause diffusiophoreisis and thermophoreisis to combine and increase the efficiency with which droplets would <b>scavenge</b> <b>aerosols...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{systematically}} {{investigate the}} effects of Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen process (hereafter WBF) on black carbon (BC) scavenging efficiency, surface BC air, deposition flux, concentration in snow (BC snow, ng g − 1), and washout ratio using a global 3 -D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). We differentiate riming- versus WBF-dominated in-cloud scavenging based on liquid water content (LWC) and temperature. Specifically, we implement an implied WBF parameterization using either temperature or ice mass fraction (IMF) in mixed-phase clouds based on field measurements. We find that at Jungfraujoch, Switzerland, and Abisko, Sweden, where WBF dominates in-cloud scavenging, including the WBF effect strongly reduces the discrepancies of simulated BC scavenging efficiency and washout ratio against observations (from a factor of 3 to 10  % and from a factor of 4 – 5 to a factor of 2). However, at Zeppelin, Norway, where riming dominates, simulation of BC scavenging efficiency, BC air, and washout ratio become worse (relative to observations) when WBF is included. There is thus an urgent need for extensive observations to distinguish and characterize riming- versus WBF-dominated <b>aerosol</b> <b>scavenging</b> in mixed-phase clouds and the associated BC scavenging efficiency. Our model results show that including the WBF effect lowers global BC scavenging efficiency, with a higher reduction at higher latitudes (8  % in the tropics and up to 76  % in the Arctic). The resulting annual mean BC air increases by up to 156  % at high altitudes and at northern high latitudes because of lower temperature and higher IMF. Overall, WBF halves the model–observation discrepancy (from − 65 to − 30  %) of BC air across North America, Europe, China and the Arctic. Globally WBF increases BC burden from 0. 22 to 0. 29 – 0. 35  mg m − 2  yr − 1, which partially explains the gap between observed and previous model-simulated BC burdens over land. In addition, WBF significantly increases BC lifetime from 5. 7 to [*]∼[*]  8  days. Additionally, WBF results in a significant redistribution of BC deposition in source and remote regions. Specifically, it lowers BC wet deposition (by 37 – 63  % at northern mid-latitudes and by 21 – 29  % in the Arctic), while it increases dry deposition (by 3 – 16  % at mid-latitudes and by 81 – 159  % in the Arctic). The resulting total BC deposition is lower at mid-latitudes (by 12 – 34  %) but higher in the Arctic (by 2 – 29  %). We find that WBF decreases BC snow at mid-latitudes (by [*]∼[*]  15  %) but increases it in the Arctic (by 26  %) while improving model comparisons with observations. In addition, WBF dramatically reduces the model–observation discrepancy of washout ratios in winter (from a factor of 16 to 4). The remaining discrepancies in BC air, BC snow and BC washout ratios suggest that in-cloud removal in mixed-phased clouds is likely still excessive over land...|$|R
40|$|We apply our Snow, Ice, and Aerosol Radiative (SNICAR) model, {{coupled to}} a general {{circulation}} model with prognostic carbon aerosol transport, to improve understanding of climate forcing and response from black carbon (BC) in snow. Building on two previous studies, we account for interannually varying biomass burning BC emissions, snow aging, and <b>aerosol</b> <b>scavenging</b> by snow meltwater. We assess uncertainty in forcing estimates from these factors, as well as BC optical properties and snow cover fraction. BC emissions are the largest source of uncertainty, followed by snow aging. The rate of snow aging determines snowpack effective radius (r e), which directly controls snow reflectance and the magnitude of albedo change caused by BC. For a reasonable r e range, reflectance reduction from BC varies threefold. Inefficient meltwater scavenging keeps hydrophobic impurities near the surface during melt and enhances forcing. Applying biomass burning BC emission inventories for a strong (1998) and weak (2001) boreal fire year, we estimate global annual mean BC/snow surface radiative forcing from all sources (fossil fuel, biofuel, and biomass burning) of + 0. 054 (0. 007 – 0. 13) and + 0. 049 (0. 007 – 0. 12) W m− 2, respectively. Snow forcing from only fossil fuel + biofuel sources is + 0. 043 W m− 2  (forcing from only fossil fuels is + 0. 033 W m− 2), suggesting that the anthropogenic contribution to total forcing is at least 80 %. The 1998 global land and sea-ice snowpack absorbed 0. 60 and 0. 23 W m− 2, respectively, because of direct BC/snow forcing. The forcing is maximum coincidentally with snowmelt onset, triggering strong snow-albedo feedback in local springtime. Consequently, the “efficacy” of BC/snow forcing is {{more than three times}} greater than forcing by CO 2. The 1998 and 2001 land snowmelt rates north of 50 °N are 28 % and 19 % greater in the month preceding maximum melt of control simulations without BC in snow. With climate feedbacks, global annual mean 2 -meter air temperature warms 0. 15 and 0. 10 °C, when BC is included in snow, whereas annual arctic warming is 1. 61 and 0. 50 °C. Stronger high-latitude climate response in 1998 than 2001 is at least partially caused by boreal fires, which account for nearly all of the 35 % biomass burning contribution to 1998 arctic forcing. Efficacy was anomalously large in this experiment, however, and more research is required to elucidate the role of boreal fires, which we suggest have maximum arctic BC/snow forcing potential during April–June. Model BC concentrations in snow agree reasonably well (r = 0. 78) with a set of 23 observations from various locations, spanning nearly 4 orders of magnitude. We predict concentrations in excess of 1000 ng g− 1  for snow in northeast China, enough to lower snow albedo by more than 0. 13. The greatest instantaneous forcing is over the Tibetan Plateau, exceeding 20 W m− 2  in some places during spring.

40|$|In the Amazonian atmosphere, the aerosol coarse mode {{comprises}} a complex, diverse, {{and variable}} mixture of bioaerosols emitted {{from the rain}} forest ecosystem, long-range transported Saharan dust, marine aerosols from the Atlantic Ocean, and coarse smoke particles from deforestation fires. For the rain forest, the coarse mode particles are of significance with respect to biogeochemical and hydrological cycling as well as ecology and biogeography. However, detailed knowledge on the physicochemical and biological properties {{as well as the}} ecological role of the Amazonian coarse mode is still sparse. This study presents results from multi-year coarse mode measurements at the remote Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO) site. It combines online aerosol observations, selected remote sensing and modelling results, as well as dedicated coarse mode sampling and analysis. The focal points of this study are a systematic characterization of aerosol coarse mode abundance and properties in the Amazonian atmosphere as well as a detailed analysis of the frequent, pulse-wise intrusion of African long-range transport (LRT) aerosols (comprising Saharan dust and African biomass burning smoke) into the Amazon Basin. We find that, on a multi-year time scale, the Amazonian coarse mode maintains remarkably constant concentration levels (with 0. 4  cm − 3 and 4. 0  µg m − 3 in the wet vs. 1. 2  cm − 3 and 6. 5  µg m − 3 in the dry season) with rather weak seasonal trends (in terms of abundance and size spectrum), which is {{in stark contrast to the}} pronounced biomass burning-driven seasonality of the submicron aerosol population and related parameters. For most of the time, bioaerosol particles from the forest biome account for a major fraction of the coarse mode background population. However, from Dec to Apr there are episodic intrusions of African LRT aerosols, comprising Saharan dust, sea salt particles from the transatlantic passages, and African biomass burning smoke. Remarkably, during the core period of this LRT season (i. e., Feb–Mar), the presence of LRT influence, occurring as a sequence of pulse-like plumes, appears to be rather the norm than an exception. The LRT pulses increase the coarse mode concentrations drastically (up to 100  µg m − 3) and alter coarse mode composition as well as its size spectrum. Efficient transport of the LRT plumes into the Amazon Basin takes place in response to specific mesoscale circulation patterns in combination with the episodic absence of rain-related <b>aerosol</b> <b>scavenging</b> en route. Based on a modelling study, we estimated a dust deposition flux of 5 – 10  kg ha − 1  a − 1 in the region of the ATTO site. Furthermore, a chemical analysis quantified the substantial increase of crustal and sea salt elements under LRT conditions in comparison to the background coarse mode composition. With these results, we estimated the deposition fluxes of various elements that are considered as nutrients for the rain forest ecosystem. These estimates range from few g ha − 1  a − 1 up to several hundreds of g ha − 1  a − 1 in the ATTO region. The long-term data presented here provide a statistically solid basis for future studies of the manifold aspects of the dynamic coarse mode aerosol cycling in the Amazon. Thus, it may help to understand its biogeochemical relevance in this ecosystem as well as to evaluate to what extent anthropogenic influences have altered the coarse mode cycling already...|$|R
