Previously expected to be complete in summer 2012, the structure opened in April 2013.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Wataru Takeishi. The video opens with shots of New York City, and then has Hamasaki on <b>a</b> <b>rooftop.</b> Hamasaki is then singing the track with several different camera angles circulating her and the city. During the first verse, it has her in an apartment, sitting on a couch with a butterfly hair clip; this scene is used throughout the entire video. It then has three shots of her in different clothes; one with a brown leather jacket, brown wig and cowboy hat, the second with a red dress on, and the third with a black jacket and crop hair style. The shot {{with her in the}} brown leather jacket, brown wig and cowboy hat then shows her on <b>a</b> <b>rooftop</b> singing the song. The final pre-chorus and chorus has her driving through New York City, and has her in a pink dress watching the snow fall; it ends with her in the red dress, holding her hands out for the snow to fall. The music video was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: A Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014), and the DVD and Blu-Ray re-release edition of her 2001 compilation album A Best (2016).|$|E

Outside the palace grounds, an American contractor died after falling from <b>a</b> <b>rooftop</b> {{where he had}} been watching the bombing. Despite the confusion, most of the city's inhabitants went about their usual business, indifferent to the chaos. The attack lasted 30 minutes and though they carried enough bombs to level the palace, the pilots did not expend all their munitions.|$|E
5|$|Franklin {{realized}} that wooden buildings could {{be protected from}} lightning strikes, and the deadly fires that often resulted, by placing a pointed iron on <b>a</b> <b>rooftop,</b> with {{the other end of}} the rod placed deep into the ground. The sharp point of the lightning rod would attract the electrical discharge from the cloud, and the lightning bolt would hit the iron rod instead of the wooden building. The electric charge from the lightning would flow through the rod directly into the earth, bypassing the structure, and preventing a fire.|$|E
5|$|On September 29, 2006, Monsoor's platoon engaged four {{insurgents in}} a firefight, killing one and {{injuring}} another.

Civilians aiding the insurgents blocked off the streets, and a nearby mosque broadcast {{a message for}} people {{to fight against the}} Americans and the Iraqi soldiers. Monsoor was protecting other SEALs, two of whom were 15 feet away from him. Monsoor's position made him the only SEAL on the rooftop with quick access to an escape route.|$|E

5|$|The Blathwayt {{family owned}} the house until 1956, when the {{government}} acquired it, but during the Second World War it was used for child evacuees while rented by Lady Anne Islington, the wife of John Dickson-Poynder, 1st Baron Islington, who redecorated many of the rooms. The National Trust acquired it in 1961. In 2015 major renovation work, costing £3.8 million, included replacing the roof. Part of the cost was met from a Heritage Lottery Fund grant of £85,000. While the repairs were in progress, visitors could view the house from <b>a</b> <b>rooftop</b> walkway.|$|E

5|$|Construction on the Modernist {{hotel was}} to have started {{in the spring of}} 1970. However, {{construction}} on the , $23 million hotel and office building did not begin until June 1971. The Loews Hotels chain agreed to co-finance construction of the property with L'Enfant Plaza Corp., although details of the agreement were not provided. The hotel would occupy the top four floors and lobby of the 12-story building, with separate elevators for office tenants and hotel guests. The 378-room hotel, designed by Koubek, had <b>a</b> <b>rooftop</b> swimming pool, two restaurants, a cocktail lounge, and meeting rooms. The general contractor for the building was George Hyman Construction Co. (now Clark Construction Group).|$|E

The explosion threw Van Winkle into the street. Cowdrey was killed, his body never found. His company continued to search for him amid the rubble for two days. His name appears along with many others on a memorial in Trinity Churchyard in New York for volunteer firefighters {{who died in the}} line of duty.|$|E

They were recovered after 18 months and a former movie studio security guard and an accomplice were arrested. Production moved to New York City for two weeks, taking in locations such as the Queensboro Bridge, the exteriors of Columbia University's Low Memorial Library and the New York Public Library, and <b>a</b> <b>rooftop</b> garden in the Rockefeller Center.

As he staggered, one of the rioters took Ladd's musket from him and fired, wounding him in the leg. Ladd died on Pratt Street. He is known as the first Union soldier to be killed in action during the Civil War. Three other militiamen were killed during the riot: Private Addison O. Whitney, Private Charles A. Taylor and Corporal Sumner H. Needham. A total of 36 members of the 6th Massachusetts were wounded.|$|E
5|$|The library {{incorporates}} {{many aspects}} of environmentally-sensitive design, in accordance to Clinton's work involving sustainable development.

The library's flooring is made of recycled rubber tires and there are charging stations for electric vehicles in the parking lot. In 2007, <b>a</b> <b>rooftop</b> garden was established atop the library, in addition to existing solar panels.

5|$|The {{third and}} current DeKalb County Courthouse was {{constructed}} in 1905 at an approximate cost of $137,000. The project reignited {{the debate over the}} county courthouse's location and, once again, the debate over which town would hold the coveted title of county seat. The county Board of Supervisors authorized the project in 1901 and appropriated $100,000 for the new building. The idea for a new courthouse originated as early as 1900, when the essential design elements of the Lee County courthouse were chosen as the model for the new DeKalb County Courthouse. Though the courthouse was modeled after the Lee County structure it does differ; the Lee County building, in Dixon, Illinois, has <b>a</b> <b>rooftop</b> dome and also is longer and wider than the DeKalb County building. By 1903, the appropriation had been upped to $140,000 and the battle over the county seat had begun.|$|E
5|$|After Andrianampoinimerina reunited {{the divided}} and warring Kingdom of Imerina, he {{successfully}} pursued an expansionist policy that saw his authority extended {{over a large}} portion of Madagascar by {{the time of his death}} in 1810. Having captured Antananarivo by 1793 and transferred his capital from Ambohimanga to Antananarivo the following year, Andrianampoinimerina established new structures on the Rova grounds that would become imbued with the political and historic significance of his reign. In keeping with the tradition of Merina sovereigns before him, each building was assigned a name by which it could be distinguished. Several of the buildings were used interchangeably by the king as personal residences, including Manjakamiadana ("Where It is Pleasant to Rule"), Besakana, Manatsaralehibe ("Vast Improvement", also called Manatsara)—which he alone was authorised to enter—and Marivolanitra ("Beneath the Heavens"), a building reportedly designed with a staircase leading to <b>a</b> <b>rooftop</b> observation deck from which the king could observe the town and plains below.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, civil {{engineer}} Virgil Bogue presented {{a comprehensive plan}} {{for the city of}} Seattle, including an elevated rapid transit line running southeast from King Street Station through Chinatown towards the Rainier Valley. The plan was, however, rejected by voters on March 5, 1912, leaving it unimplemented. In 1957, Seattle City Engineer M. O. Anderberg and the Seattle Transit Commission proposed a rapid transit system utilizing the right-of-way cleared for Interstate 5 between Everett and Tacoma. The rapid transit line would travel through downtown Seattle in a tunnel under 5th Avenue, with one of its two stations at South Jackson Street at the site of Union Station. The proposal included redevelopment of Union Station into a multi-level transportation hub, with a bus terminal for intercity and suburban buses, a public parking garage, and <b>a</b> <b>rooftop</b> heliport. The proposal was rejected by the federal government, not wanting to jeopardize freeway construction, and was ultimately shelved.|$|E
