25|$|Important {{forms of}} {{intangible}} rewards include praise, recognition and rewards. Intangible rewards <b>are</b> <b>ones</b> from which an employee does not derive any material gain.

Hits above the threshold indicate extraordinary performance. Furthermore, if more than half the dice rolled <b>are</b> <b>ones,</b> then the player has made a glitch. Glitches cause bad things to happen to the player and game masters are encouraged to be inventive and funny.|$|E

Annually, an estimated 40% of all Antesaka migrants resettled permanently outside their traditional territory in the early 1960s; these migrants typically sent cash back to their family members at home.|$|E
25|$|The 2003–2005 Under Grand Hotel, {{set in a}} men's prison, {{has been}} praised for showing a more {{realistic}} depiction of rape. Authors such as Fusanosuke Inariya (of Maiden Rose fame) utilize rape not as the traditional romantic catalyst, but as a tragic dramatic plot element, rendering her stories a subversion of contemporary tropes that reinforce and reflect older tropes such as the prevalence of romantic tragedy themes. Other yaoi tend to depict a relationship that begins as non-consensual and evolves into a consensual relationship. However, Fusanosuke's stories <b>are</b> <b>ones</b> where the characters' relationship begins as consensual and devolves into non-consensual, often due to external societal pressures that label the character's gay relationship as deviant. Her stories are still characterized by fantasy, yet they do brutally and realistically illustrate scenes of sexual assault between characters.|$|E
25|$|Taken together, {{proponents of}} {{reconciliation}} ecology see the species-area relationship and human domination {{of a large}} percentage of the earth's area as a sign that we will not be able to set aside enough land to protect all of life's biodiversity. There can be negative effects of setting land aside because it means the remaining land is used more intensely. For example, less land is required for crop production when high levels of inorganic fertilizer is applied, but these chemicals will affect nearby land set aside for natural ecosystems. The direct benefits of land transformation for the growing world population often make it ethically difficult to justify the tradeoff between biodiversity and human use. Reconciled ecosystems <b>are</b> <b>ones</b> in which humans dominate, but natural biodiversity is encouraged to persist within the human landscape. Ideally, this creates a more sustainable socio-ecological system and does not necessitate a trade off between biodiversity and human use.|$|E

25|$|The tackle is {{complete}} when the ball-carrier {{is brought to}} the ground; this is judged {{to be the case}} as soon as a knee touches the ground while being held by the opposition. The tackler is designated as any player that also goes to ground when making the tackle. If no player goes to ground when tackling a player, then there is no tackler. The tackler has to immediately let the tackled player go and get to their feet before attempting to compete for the ball. If they do not get to their feet, they must roll away from the tackled player. The player that is tackled must immediately play the ball by pushing, passing or placing it in any direction. If a player is involved in the tackle, but does not go to ground, they must also release the tackled player, allowing them the chance to play the ball. Only players on their feet, and supporting their own weight, may pick up the ball and any players on the ground must not prevent them from gaining possession. Except for the tackler (player who went to ground when making the tackle) and the tackled player, all other players must enter the tackle area from behind the ball. The tackle must not be dangerous. Dangerous tackles <b>are</b> <b>ones</b> that make contact with their opponent around their neck or head, with a locked elbow and extended arm ("stiff arm"), without using their arms ("shoulder charge"), when they are in the air, when they don't have the ball, or ones that drive or drop a players head or neck into the ground while their feet are in the air ("spear tackle"). Using a foot to trip a player is also illegal.|$|E

500|$|Other die {{components}} include cores and slides. Cores are {{components that}} usually produce holes or opening, {{but they can}} be used to create other details as well. There are three types of cores: fixed, movable, and loose. Fixed cores <b>are</b> <b>ones</b> that are oriented parallel to the pull direction of the dies (i.e. the direction the dies open), therefore they are fixed, or permanently attached to the die. Movable cores <b>are</b> <b>ones</b> that are oriented in any other way than parallel to the pull direction. These cores must be removed from the die cavity after the shot solidifies, but before the dies open, using a separate mechanism. Slides are similar to movable cores, except they are used to form undercut surfaces. The use of movable cores and slides greatly increases the cost of the dies. Loose cores, also called pick-outs, are used to cast intricate features, such as threaded holes. These loose cores are inserted into the die by hand before each cycle and then ejected with the part {{at the end of the}} cycle. The core then must be removed by hand. Loose cores are the most expensive type of core, because of the extra labor and increased cycle time. Other features in the dies include water-cooling passages and vents along the parting lines. These vents are usually wide and thin (approximately [...] ) so that when the molten metal starts filling them the metal quickly solidifies and minimizes scrap. No risers are used because the high pressure ensures a continuous feed of metal from the gate.|$|E
