In this 10 -month study, we examined temporal changes in <b>virus-host</b> <b>interactions</b> and viral life cycles (lytic versus lysogenic) {{in relation to the}} prevailing environmental conditions in a subtropical water reservoir (Wivenhoe) in southeast Queensland, Australia. Heterotrophic prokaryotes and picocyanobacteria were positively correlated with concentrations of viruses throughout the study, indicating the presence of both bacteriophages and cyanophages in the reservoir. The percentage of heterotrophic prokaryotes and picocyanobacteria containing intracellular viruses (FVIC) ranged between 0. 2 % and 2. 4 % and did not vary significantly over the 10 -month study, whereas lysogenic heterotrophic prokaryotes were only detected in the drier months of June and July. Spearman rank correlation analysis showed that the oxidative-reduction potential (ORP) of the water reservoir influenced the concentrations of viruses, heterotrophic prokaryotes and picocyanobacteria significantly, with low ORP offering a favourable environment for these components. There was a negative relationship between FVIC and rainfall suggesting the associated run-off altered <b>virus-host</b> <b>interactions.</b> Overall, our study provides novel information and inferences on how <b>virus-host</b> <b>interactions</b> in subtropical freshwaters might respond to changes in precipitation predicted to occur with global climate change.

40|$|<b>Virus-host</b> <b>interactions</b> drive a {{remarkable}} diversity of immune responses and countermeasures. We found that two RNA viruses with broad host ranges, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Sindbis virus (SINV), are completely restricted in their replication after entry into Lepidopteran cells. This restriction is overcome when cells are co-infected with vaccinia virus (VACV), a vertebrate DNA virus. Using RNAi screening, {{we show that}} Lepidopteran RNAi, Nuclear Factor-kappaB, and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways restrict RNA virus infection. Surprisingly, a highly conserved, uncharacterized VACV protein, A 51 R, can partially overcome this virus restriction. We show that A 51 R is also critical for VACV replication in vertebrate cells and for pathogenesis in mice. Interestingly, A 51 R colocalizes with, and stabilizes, host microtubules and also associates with ubiquitin. We show that A 51 R promotes viral protein stability, possibly by preventing ubiquitin-dependent targeting of viral proteins for destruction. Importantly, our studies reveal exciting new opportunities to study <b>virus-host</b> <b>interactions</b> in experimentally-tractable Lepidopteran systems...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHuman, animal, fungal, {{and plant}} viruses encode papain-like proteinases that {{function}} in polyprotein processing, RNA synthesis, and <b>virus–host</b> <b>interactions.</b> To compare the functional profiles of diverse papain-like proteinases, we replaced a proteinase gene of the beet yellows virus (BYV) with those derived from equine arteritis virus (EAV), {{foot-and-mouth disease virus}} (FMDV), and the fungal virus CHV 1. We found that, although each of the foreign proteinases efficiently processed the viral polyprotein, only the EAV proteinase supported vigorous replication of the chimeric BYV in plant protoplasts. This result demonstrated that the proteinases of BYV and EAV, but not FMDV or CHV 1, provide a function that is critical for genome replication and that is separable from polyprotein processing. Further characterization of the BYV–EAV chimera revealed that BYV proteinase is also required for virus invasion and cell-to-cell movement. Thus, the same viral protein can combine both replication-related functions shared by plant and animal viruses and specialized functions in <b>virus–host</b> <b>interactions...</b>|$|R

The HIV- 1 pathogenesis in LTs has been extensively studied; however, our understanding of the <b>virus-host</b> <b>interactions</b> in the very early stages of infection remains incomplete. We investigated <b>virus-host</b> <b>interactions</b> in the rectal draining lymph nodes (dLNs) of rhesus macaques at different times after intrarectal inoculation (days postinoculation [dpi]) with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). At 3 dpi, 103 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected using next-generation mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq). At 6 and 10 dpi, concomitant with increased SIV replication, 366 and 1, 350 DEGs were detected, respectively, including upregulation of genes encoding proteins that play a role in innate antiviral immune responses, inflammation, and immune activation. Notably, genes (IFI 16, caspase- 1, and interleukin 1 β [IL- 1 β]) in the canonical pyroptosis pathway were significantly upregulated in expression. We further validated increased pyroptosis using flow cytometry and found that the number of CD 4 + T cells expressing activated caspase- 1 protein, the hallmark of ongoing pyroptosis, were significantly increased, which is correlated with decreased CD 4 + T cells in dLNs. Our results demonstrated that pyroptosis contributes to the CD 4 + T cell death in vivo in early SIV infection, which suggests that pyroptosis may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of SIV, and by extension, that of HIV- 1, since pyroptosis not only induces CD 4 + T cell death but also amplifies inflammation and immune activation. Thus, blocking CD 4 + T cell pyroptosis could be a complementary treatment to antiretroviral therapy...|$|R
30|$|<b>Virus-host</b> <b>interaction</b> is {{a common}} process in environment, {{including}} infection, symbiosis and predation that can dynamically alter the evolution, diversity and metabolic potential of its host and finally affect the function of this interaction (De Smet et al., 2017). Traditionally, the studies of <b>virus-host</b> <b>interaction</b> were mainly based on laboratory experiments with pure cultures or indirect analyses of signatures using metagenomic approaches (Wang et al., 2016). However, the unculturable characteristic of most microbes limits such analysis of <b>virus-host</b> <b>interaction,</b> and similarly, metagenomics {{does not allow for}} the unambiguous identification of individual virus-host pairs. Single-cell genomics, owing to its culture-independent feature, can recover bacterial nuclear sequences and extra-chromosomal genetic elements in a cell simultaneously and thus can greatly facilitate cultivation-independent and cell-specific <b>virus-host</b> <b>interaction</b> studies. By using this approach, Yoon et al found a novel nanovirus from uncultivated Picozoan protist cells and obtained its whole genome sequence (Yoon et al., 2011). In another study, by analyzing 127 single amplified genomes (SAGs) of the uncultured gamma-proteobacterial clade SUP 05, Roux et al found that a third of these cells were infected by Caudovirales (dsDNA) or Microviridae (ssDNA) bacteriophages (Roux et al., 2014). Similarly, Labonté et al. employed single-cell sequencing to analyze individual bacterial and archaeal cells simultaneously with viruses being inside or attached to them in their native environment (Labonte et al., 2015). They found that the viruses could be identified in 20 out of 58 phylogenetically and geographically diverse single amplified genomes (SAGs) of marine bacteria and archaea and at least four phage-host interactions had the characteristics of late lytic infections. This study demonstrates that single-cell genomics, in conjunction with sequence-based computational tools, enables in situ and cultivation-independent insights into host-virus interactions in complex microbial communities. Martinez-Garcia et al. combined SAG and microarrays to pinpoint the interaction between viruses and the ubiquitous hyperhalophilic Nanohaloarchaeota (Martinez-Garcia et al., 2014). Avital et al. used the scDual-Seq technology to analyze the interaction between intracellular pathogen Salmonella typhimurium and mouse macrophages, the RNA of the single-cell host macrophages cell and it’s infecting bacteria were sequenced simultaneously (Avital et al., 2017). They found three subpopulations of infected macrophages and many evidences of linear progression through these subpopulations which supporting a model that these three states correspond to consecutive stages of infection. Munson-McGee et al. combined single-cell sequencing with environmental metagenomics to explore the <b>virus-host</b> <b>interactions</b> in a Yellowstone National Park hot spring microbial community (Munson-McGee et al., 2018). They found that a broad spectrum of virus types from specialists to generalists coexist in a relatively low-diversity community. More than 60 % of cells contain at least one virus type and a majority of these cells contain two or more virus types. Another study applied single-virus genomics and viral metagenomics to study the viral community structure of the oral cavity in human salivary samples (de la Cruz Peña et al., 2018), in which salivary viruses could be classified into about 200 major viral clusters, corresponding to approximately genus-level grouping. These studies demonstrate the power of single-cell metagenomics to unveil the diversity and genetic information of uncultured viruses in various communities.|$|R

40|$|At a {{crossroads}} between biology and medicine, epidemiology {{is the study}} of infectious and non infectious diseases in populations. In particular, epidemiology of infectious diseases relies on the articulation between the biology of the germ(s) and the biology of the host population(s). <b>Virus-host</b> <b>interactions</b> are studied by epidemiologists at different levels and from different perspectives. The concept of emerging infectious disease, elaborated in the 1990 s, emphasizes the need to investigate both the molecular and ecological aspects of <b>virus-host</b> <b>interactions.</b> Molecular approaches in epidemiology focus on the genetic, subcellular and cellular aspects of the host-germ relationship at the individual and population levels, while ecological approaches insist on the spatial distribution of host and germ populations, their relationships with their environment, and their interactions with other species. This paper describes integration processes at work between ecological and molecular approaches in the epidemiology of two RNA viruses since the advent of the concept of emerging infectious disease.

40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{events in}} the molecular arms race between the host and pathogen in evaluating plant immunity, a zigzag model is useful for uncovering aspects common to different host-pathogen interactions. By analogy of the steps in <b>virus-host</b> <b>interactions</b> with the steps in the standard zigzag model outlined in recent papers, we may regard RNA silencing as pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) against viruses, RNA silencing suppressors (RSSs) as effectors to overcome host RNA silencing and resistance gene (R-gene) -mediated defense as effector-triggered immunity (ETI) recognizing RSSs as avirulence proteins. However, because the standard zigzag model does not fully apply to some unique aspects in the interactions between a plant host and virus, we here defined a model especially designed for viruses.

40|$|The {{natural history}} of human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) is inextricably associated with mucosal surfaces. The vast preponderance of primary infections occur following mucosal exposure to infectious virions, and the high seroprevalence of HCMV throughout the world is due to long-term excretion of HCMV in bodily fluids from multiple mucosal sites. Accumulating evidence presents a model where the earliest <b>virus-host</b> <b>interactions</b> following infection dictate the long-term pattern of infection, alter innate immune responses that skew adaptive responses to enable persistence within an immune host, and are essential for reinfection of a host with prior immunity. HCMV has evolved a complex repertoire of viral functions fine-tuned to manipulate the immune environment both locally at the sites of infection and systemically within an infected host. Collectively, viral immune modulation represents a significant impediment for an HCMV vaccine. As HCMV can disseminate beyond mucosal surfaces to reinfect immune hosts, it may not matter whether prior immunity results from prior infection or immunization.
