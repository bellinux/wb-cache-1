Croatian forces failed in their primary objective: containing the garrison. Nonetheless, the JNA threat from the Logorište barracks was removed (freeing up forces assigned to the blockade of the barracks) <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of weapons were captured.|$|E

Houphouët reacted by creating a multi-ethnic all-African roll with both non-citizens and citizens (mostly Senegalese with French citizenship). As a result, most of the African contenders withdrew <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of the French protested by abstaining, thus assuring a decisive victory for his African Bloc.|$|E
5|$|However, {{war with}} England {{continued}} {{for several decades}} {{after the death of}} Bruce.

Although the Bruce dynasty was successful, David II's lack of an heir allowed his half-nephew Robert II to come to the throne and establish the Stewart Dynasty. The Stewarts ruled Scotland {{for the remainder of the}} Middle Ages. The country they ruled experienced greater prosperity from the end of the 14th century through the Scottish Renaissance to the Reformation.
