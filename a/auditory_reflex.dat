40|$|Cochlear nucleus (CN), the {{exclusive}} destination of the auditory nerve, is the gateway for all central processing of auditory information. The CN comprises three major subdivisions: anteroventral, posteroventral and dorsal (AVCN, PVCN and DCN, respectively), {{each of which}} contains anatomically and physiologically distinct neurons projecting onto different targets. This research used focal electric stimulation of small, confined parts of the CN in anesthetized guinea pigs to resolve {{the roles of the}} CN divisions, in two contexts. Part i explored the effect of stimulation on the gross neural potential (electrically evoked auditory brainstem response, EABR). In AVCN and PVCN away from the 8 th nerve fibers entering the brainstem, stimulation consistently evoked waveforms comprising 3 waves, suggesting a diffuse distribution of cellular generator of the EABR. On the other hand, in vestibular structures (vestibular nerve root and Scarpa's ganglion), the characteristic waveform comprised only two waves. Stimulation of multiple neural structures, as seen with higher stimulus levels or stimulation in auditory nerve root area generally produced more complex and variable waveforms. Part 2 explored the effects of stimulation on the activation of one type of <b>auditory</b> <b>reflex,</b> medial olivocochlear (MOC) reflex. The reflex was monitored through its effects on distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE). The MOC reflex was activated bilaterally by stimulating PVCN or AVCN shell, but not AVCN core. These results suggest that there are two groups of MOC interneurons in specific parts of CN. by Ryuji Suzuki. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, 2010.

40|$|The latency {{and pattern}} of muscle {{recruitment}} in the startle response elicited by unexpected auditory stimulation was determined in 12 healthy subjects. Reflex EMG activity was recorded first in orbicularis oculi. This was of similar latency {{to the normal}} <b>auditory</b> blink <b>reflex</b> and, unlike the generalized startle response, persisted despite the frequent presentation of the test stimulus. It is argued that this early latency activity in orbicularis oculi represents a normal <b>auditory</b> blink <b>reflex</b> and {{is not part of}} the generalized <b>auditory</b> startle <b>reflex.</b> With the exception of this early latency activity in orbicularis oculi, the relative latencies of both cranial and distal muscles in the auditory startle response increased with the distance of their respective segmental innervations from the caudal brainstem. Thus the earliest EMG activity was recorded in sternocleidomastoid. The recruitment of caudal muscles was relatively slow and the latencies of the intrinsic hand muscles were disproportionately long. The pattern of recruitment of cranial muscles suggests a brainstem origin for the normal startle response. Studies on the <b>auditory</b> startle <b>reflex</b> in animals are reviewed in the light of this finding...|$|R

40|$|Background: Exaggerated startle {{reactions}} {{have been}} frequently described {{in patients with}} functional movement disorders (FMD). Long onset latencies and inconsistent recruitment pattern {{are thought to be}} a hallmark in these patients. The <b>auditory</b> startle <b>reflex</b> has not been systematically assessed though. Objectives: Assessing the frequency and pattern of the early and late component of the auditory startle response in patients with functional jerky movement disorders. Methods: A case-control design was used to study 17 patients with functional jerky movement disorders and 15 healthy gender- and age-matched control subjects. The <b>auditory</b> startle <b>reflex</b> was elicited by 108 dB loud tones and assessed with electromyography in multiple muscles. Results: Response probability of the early and the late response were significantly enlarged in patients with FMD. The early response showed a normal muscle recruitment pattern whereas the late response revealed a more variable pattern compared to controls. The early and late responses showed normal habituation in both groups. Remarkably, a high response rate of the abdominal muscle was noted especially in patients suffering from abdominal jerks. Conclusions: This study shows enlarged, but normally patterned early startle responses in FMD. The high response frequency of the late responses found in these patients reflects a behavioral component. Hypersensitivity to external stimuli, often noted in FMD is supported by high response probabilities of both components of the auditory startle response. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The differences in behavior of these groups suggest that two learning strategies may be involved.

40|$|<b>Auditory</b> startle <b>reflexes</b> can {{accelerate}} simple voluntary reaction times (StartReact effect). To {{investigate the}} role of startle reflexes on more complex motor behaviour we formulated two questions: (1) can <b>auditory</b> startle <b>reflexes</b> shorten choice reaction times?; (2) is the StartReact effect differentially modulated when startling auditory stimuli are delivered ipsilaterally or contralaterally to an imperative ‘go’ signal? We instructed 16 healthy subjects to rotate their head {{as rapidly as possible}} to the left or to right in response to a guiding visual imperative stimulus (IS), in both a simple and choice reaction protocol. Startling acoustic stimuli (113 dB) were delivered simultaneously with the IS (from either the same or opposite side) to induce the StartReact effect. We recorded kinematics of head rotations and electromyographic responses. The StartReact effect was present during choice reaction tasks (56 ms onset reduction; P < 0. 001). The presentation side of the startling stimulus (left/right) did not influence the effect in choice reaction tasks. We observed a directional effect in simple reaction tasks, but this probably occurred due to a flooring effect of reaction times. Onsets of EMG responses in neck muscles were not influenced by the direction of the acoustic startling stimulus. Startling acoustic stimuli decrease reaction times not only in simple but also in choice reaction time tasks, suggesting that startle reflexes can accelerate adequate human motor responses. The absence of a clear directional sensitivity of reaction times to startling acoustic stimuli suggests that the acceleration is not highly specific, but seems to provide a global preparatory effect upon which further tailored action can be undertaken more quickly...|$|R

This rat strain is an experimental model usually employed to study photoreceptor degeneration. Although the mutated protein should not interfere with other sensory functions, observing severe loss of <b>auditory</b> <b>reflexes</b> in response to natural sounds led us to study auditory brain response (ABR) recording. Animals were separated into different hearing levels following the response to natural stimuli (hand clapping and kissing sounds). Of all the analyzed animals, 25. 9 % presented auditory loss before 50 days of age (P 50) and 45 % were totally deaf by P 200. ABR recordings showed that all the rats had a higher hearing threshold than the control Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, which was also higher than any other rat strains. The integrity of the central and peripheral auditory pathway was analyzed by histology and immunocytochemistry. In the cochlear nucleus (CN), statistical {{differences were found between}} SD and P 23 H- 1 rats in VGluT 1 distribution, but none were found when labeling all the CN synapses with anti-Syntaxin. This finding suggests anatomical and/or molecular abnormalities in the auditory downstream pathway. The inner ear of the hypoacusic P 23 H- 1 rats showed several anatomical defects, including loss and disruption of hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons. All these results can explain, at least in part, how hearing impairment can occur in a high percentage of P 23 H- 1 rats. P 23 H- 1 rats may be considered an experimental model with visual and auditory dysfunctions in future research...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} posture on the EMG {{pattern of the}} normal <b>auditory</b> startle <b>reflex</b> was investigated. The startle {{response}} to an unexpected auditory tone was studied in eleven normal subjects when standing, and in six normal subjects when sitting relaxed or tonically plantar flexing both feet. Reflex EMG activity was recorded in the tibialis anterior and soleus about twice as frequently when standing, than when sitting relaxed. In addition, the median latencies to onset of reflex EMG activity in the tibialis anterior and soleus were about 40 and 60 ms shorter during standing, than when sitting relaxed. No short latency EMG activity was recorded in the calf muscles during tonic plantar flexion of the feet, while sitting. The effect of posture on the EMG pattern of the pathological <b>auditory</b> startle <b>reflex</b> was studied in five patients with hyperekplexia. In three patients the latency to onset of reflex EMG activity in the tibialis anterior was shorter when standing, than when sitting relaxed. The EMG pattern of the reflex response to sound was studied in detail in two of these patients and consisted of up to three successive components. The expression of each EMG component depended on the postural set of the limbs. In particular, a distinct short latency component was found in posturally important muscles following auditory stimulation. This short latency component was not recorded when sitting relaxed. It is concluded that the EMG pattern of the physiological and pathological auditory startle response is not fixed, but may change with the postural stance of the body. This finding supports {{the theory that the}} normal startle reflex and the abnormal startle reflex in hyperekplexia have a common brainstem origin...|$|R
40|$|While {{many studies}} have shown that there is a phase-dependent {{modulation}} of proprioceptive and exteroceptive reflexes during gait, little is known about such modulation for <b>auditory</b> <b>reflexes.</b> To examine how startle reactions are incorporated in an ongoing gait pattern, unexpected auditory stimuli were presented to eight healthy subjects in six phases of the step cycle during walking on a treadmill at 4 km/h. For both legs, electromyographic activity (EMG) was recorded in the biceps femoris (BF), the rectus femoris (RF), the tibialis anterior (TA), and the soleus (SO). In addition, stance and swing phases of both legs, along with knee angles of both legs and the left ankle angle, were measured. All subjects showed various response peaks. Responses with latencies of ~ 60 ms (F 1), ~ 85 ms (F 2), and ~ 145 ms (F 3) were found. The amplitude of the reflex responses was dependent on the timing of the startle stimulus in the step cycle. Although the startle response habituated rapidly, the phase-dependent modulation pattern generally remained the same. The phase-dependent amplitude modulations were not strictly correlated with the modulation of the background activity. The TA even showed a transition from facilitatory F 2 responses during stance to suppressive responses during midswing. Responses were observed in both flexors and extensors, often in coactivation, especially during stance. Furthermore the gait characteristics showed a shortening of the subsequent step cycle and a small decrease in the range of motion of ankle and knees. These results suggest that the responses are adapted to achieve extra stability dependent on the phase of the step cycle. However, even in the first trials, the changes in kinematics were small allowing a smooth progression of gait...|$|R
50|$|The {{superior}} cerebellar peduncles (brachia conjunctiva) {{emerge from}} the cerebellum and ascend to form the lateral portion of {{the roof of the}} fourth ventricle, where they enter the brainstem below the inferior colliculi. They are bridged by the superior medullary velum. The superior cerebellar peduncles represent the main output route from the cerebellum, and as such, most of their fibers are efferent. A relatively small afferent contribution is present. The efferent pathways include the cerebellorubral, dentatothalamic, and fastigioreticular tracts. All of them emerge from cerebellar nuclei; the cerebellorubral fibers from the globose and emboliform nuclei, the dentatothalamic fibers from the dentate nucleus, and the fastigioreticular fibers from the fastigial nucleus. They emerge together from the various nuclei to ascend in the roof of the fourth ventricle and proceed anteriorly to the midbrain tegmental area medial to the lateral lemniscus. The cerebellorubral fibers cross over at this point to enter the contralateral red nucleus. The dentatothalamic fibers also cross over and ascend to synapse in the ventral intermediate (VI) and ventral anterior (VA) nuclei of the thalamus. The fastigioreticular fibers enter the reticular formation of the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata.Afferent pathways include the anterior spinocerebellar and tectocerebellar tracts. The fibers of the anterior spinocerebellar tract originate in Clarke's column of the spinal cord and cross in the anterior white commissure to the lateral funiculus, where they ascend to upper pontine levels before crossing back to enter the cerebellum through the superior peduncle. They terminate in the hind limb region of the cerebellar cortex. The tectocerebellar tracts {{emerge from the}} superior and inferior colliculi on both sides, terminating in the intermediate vermis (culmen, declive, folium, tuber, pyramid) and the lobulus simplex. The function of the tectocerebellar tract is not known, but it is widely believed to mediate visual and <b>auditory</b> <b>reflexes.</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe the audiologic and related characteristics of a group patient with speech perception affected out of proportion to pure tone hearing loss. A case series of patient were referred for evaluation and management to the Hearing Research Center. To describe the clinical picture of the patients with the key clinical feature of hearing loss for pure tones and reduction in speech discrimination out of proportion to the pure tone loss, having some of the criteria of auditory neuropathy (i. e. normal otoacoustic emissions, OAE, and abnormal auditory brainstem evoked potentials, ABR) and lacking others (e. g. present <b>auditory</b> <b>reflexes).</b> Methods: Hearing abilities were measured by Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA) and Speech Discrimination Scores (SDS)), measured in all patients using a standardized list of 25 monosyllabic Farsi words at MCL in quiet. Auditory pathway integrity was measured by using Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) and Otoacoustic Emission (OAE) and anatomical lesions Computed Tomography Scan (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) of brain and retrocochlea. Patient included in the series were 35 patients who have SDS disproportionably low with regard to PTA, absent ABR waves and normal OAE. Results: All patients reported the beginning of their problem around adolescence. Neither of them had anatomical lesion in imaging studies and neither of them had any finding suggestive of conductive hearing lesion. Although in most of the cases the hearing loss had been more apparent in the lower frequencies (i. e. 1000 Hz and less), a stronger correlation was found between SDS and hearing threshold at higher frequencies. These patients may not benefit from hearing aids, as the outer hair cells are functional and amplification doesn’t seem to help; though, it was tried for all. Conclusion: These patients share a pattern of sensory –neural loss with no detectable lesion. The age of onset and the gradual deterioration are remarkable. It seems that this is a new category of sensory –neural haring loss which deserves more attention...|$|R

Timed pregnant dams were fed, beginning on d 2 of gestation and throughout lactation, either nonpurified diet (reference) or a purified diet whose fat source (22 % of energy) was either corn oil or menhaden fish oil. On postnatal d 3, pups were randomly cross-fostered among dams {{of the same}} diet group and culled to 10 pups per dam. Milk was removed from stomachs of culled pups for fatty acid analyses. From postnatal d 4 to 30, pups were assessed daily for the appearance of neurodevelopmental <b>reflexes.</b> <b>Auditory</b> brainstem conduction times were measured on postnatal d 23 and 29. Pups were killed on postnatal d 30, and cerebrums were removed for fatty acid analyses. The fatty acid composition of maternal milk and pup cerebrums reflected maternal diet {{with higher levels of}} (n- 3) and (n- 6) fatty acids in the fish oil and corn oil groups, respectively. The time of appearance of auditory startle was significantly delayed (P 0. 004), and auditory brainstem conduction times on postnatal d 23 and 29 were significantly longer in pups of the fish oil – than corn oil–fed dams (P ¡ 0. 05). A delay in the appearance of the <b>auditory</b> startle <b>reflex</b> and longer <b>auditory</b> brainstem conduction times in pups of dams fed fish oil–supplemented diet may be due to negative effects on myelination of the auditory brainstem pathway.

Study design <b>Auditory</b> startle <b>reflexes</b> were assessed in 20 children classified according to Rome III classifications of abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders (13 irritable bowel syndrome [IBS], 7 functional abdominal pain syndrome; mean age, 12. 4 years; 15 girls) and 23 control subjects (14 girls; mean age, 12. 3 years) using a case-control design. The activity of 6 left-sided muscles and the sympathetic skin response were obtained by an electromyogram. We presented sudden loud noises to the subjects through headphones.

40|$|Summary: The {{mechanisms}} of weight gain or behavioral and affective changes known {{to occur in}} patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) treated with deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN DBS) are incompletely understood. We hypothesize {{that some of these}} non-motor side-effects may be related to changes in motivational processing due to STN DBS. Motivational processing to appetitive and aversive stimuli can be assessed using subjective evaluation of emotional relevance (i. e. incentive salience attribution) or affective modulation of the <b>auditory</b> blink <b>reflex</b> (ABR). The latter provides an objective measure of changes in emotional reactivity: ABRs are physiologically potentiated by unpleasant and inhibited by pleasant stimuli, reflecting activation of the aversive and appetitive motivational systems. Our aim was to assess the effects of STN DBS on motivational processing of pictures from 4 categories, two representing primary rewards, erotica and food, one aversive fearful and one neutral, using the subjective evaluation of motivational relevance (Study 1.) and the modulation of the ABR reactivity (Study 2.) in off-medicated PD patients with DBS switched ON and OFF.

40|$|Abstract Background Cannabis use is {{associated}} with an attention-dependent deficit in prepulse inhibition of the startle reflex (PPI). The aim {{of the current study}} was to investigate startle habituation in cannabis users and healthy controls during two attentional tasks. Methods <b>Auditory</b> startle <b>reflex</b> was recorded from orbicularis oculi muscle while participants (12 controls and 16 regular cannabis users) were either attending to or ignoring 100 dB startling pulses. Startle habituation was measured as the absolute reduction in startle magnitude on block 2 (last nine trials) vs. block 1 (first nine trials). Results Startle habituation with moderate effect sizes was observed in controls and cannabis users only while they were ignoring the startling pulses but not while they were attending to them. Similar results were also observed in controls (lifetime non-users of cannabis) and cannabis users with lifetime cannabis use disorders (CUD). Conclusion Startle habituation appears to depend on selective attention but not on cannabis use. Startle habituation was present when attention was directed away from auditory startling pulses in healthy controls and cannabis users. Such a similar pattern of results in both groups suggests that at least a trend exists towards presence of startle habituation regardless of cannabis use or CUD in otherwise healthy members of the general population...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To find an {{adequate}} tool {{to assess the}} <b>auditory</b> startle <b>reflex</b> (ASR) in children. Methods: We investigated the effect of stimulus repetition, gender and age on several quantifications of the ASR. ASR's were elicited by eight consecutive auditory stimuli in 27 healthy children. Electromyographic activity of orbicularis oculi, masseter, sternocleidomastoid, deltoid, abductor pollicis brevis, quadriceps muscles and the sympathetic skin response were recorded. ASR parameters (response probability in % and magnitude in area-under-the-curve) were: (1) combined response of all six muscles (2) blink response. Results: Response probabilities were 78 % in orbicularis oculi (median latency 41 ms), 17 % in sternocleidomastoid (median latency 66 ms), 10 % in masseter (median latency 66 ms) and lower in other muscles. The ASR combined response probability and the sympathetic skin response significantly decreased with the repetitive stimuli, but the blink response probability did not. The magnitude (area-under-the-curve) of both the blink response and the combined response did not decrease with the repetitive stimuli. There were no gender or age effects. Conclusion: As in adults, the blink response and the combined response of multiple muscles show different habituation patterns in children.

40|$|Pharmacological {{and genetic}} studies support {{a role for}} NMDA {{receptor}} (NMDAR) hypofunction in the etiology of schizophrenia. We have previously demonstrated that NMDAR obligatory subunit 1 (GluN 1) deletion in corticolimbic interneurons during early postnatal development is sufficient to confer schizophrenia-like phenotypes in mice. However, the consequence of NMDAR hypofunction in cortical excitatory neurons is not well delineated. Here, we characterize a conditional knockout mouse strain (CtxGluN 1 KO mice), in which postnatal GluN 1 deletion is largely confined to the excitatory neurons in layer II/III of the medial prefrontal cortex and sensory cortices, {{as evidenced by the}} lack of GluN 1 mRNA expression in in situ hybridization immunocytochemistry as well as the lack of NMDA currents with in vitro recordings. Mutants were impaired in prepulse inhibition of the <b>auditory</b> startle <b>reflex</b> as well as object-based short-term memory. However, they did not exhibit impairments in additional hallmarks of schizophrenia-like phenotypes (e. g. spatial working memory, social behavior, saccharine preference, novelty and amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion, and anxiety-related behavior). Furthermore, upon administration of the NMDA receptor antagonist, MK- 801, there were no differences in locomotor activity versus controls. The mutant mice also showed negligible levels of reactive oxygen species production following chronic social isolation, and recording of miniature-EPSC/IPSCs from layer II/III excitatory neurons in medial prefrontal cortex suggested no alteration in GABAergic activity.

40|$|The startle {{response}} to unexpected auditory and somaesthetic stimulation was studied in 8 patients with hereditary or symptomatic hyperekplexia. It was abnormal in its resistance to habituation {{and in its}} exaggerated motor response. Both noise and taps to the face and head elicited a normal early blink response, separate from the subsequent true startle reflex. The earliest reflex EMG activity recorded after the blink was in sternocleidomastoid. EMG activity in masseter, and trunk and limb muscles followed later. This pattern of muscle recruitment suggests a brainstem origin for the abnormal {{startle response}}s. In addition, the abnormal startle responses exhibited disproportionately long latencies to the intrinsic hand and foot muscles and relatively slow recruitment of caudal muscles. The pattern of muscle recruitment was similar between patients, irrespective of the absolute latency of the response, and regardless of whether stimulation was auditory or somaesthetic. This suggests that auditory and somaesthetic afferents converge on a common brainstem efferent system, and that this system forms the final common pathway for abnormal startle responses of differing latency. The characteristics of this efferent system differ from those previously described in brainstem reticular reflex myoclonus, but {{are similar to those}} described in the normal <b>auditory</b> startle <b>reflex</b> in man. This suggests that the abnormal startle response in hyperekplexia, and the normal startle reflex represent pathological and physiological activity in the same brainstem efferent system...|$|R

CRNs project, among other targets, to the nucleus reticularis pontis caudalis (PnC), a major component of the ASR circuit, but {{little is known about the}} organization of this projection. Thus, we injected biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) in CRNs to study their projections with light and electron microscopy. Also, we performed double-labeling experiments, injecting BDA in the CRNs and subunit B of the cholera toxin or Fluorogold in the spinal cord to verify that CRNs project onto reticulospinal neurons. Electron microscopy of the labeled CRNs axons and terminals showed that even their most central and thinnest processes are myelinated. Most of the terminals are axodendritic, with multiple asymmetric synapses, and contain round vesicles (50 nm diameter). Double-labeling experiments demonstrated that CRN terminals are apposed to retrogradely labeled reticulospinal neurons in the contralateral nucleus reticularis PnC and bilaterally in the lateral paragigantocellular nucleus. Analyses of serial sections revealed that multiple CRNs synapse on single reticulospinal neurons in PnC, suggesting a convergence of auditory information. The morphometric features of these neurons classify them as giant neurons. This study confirms that CRNs project directly onto reticulospinal neurons and presents other anatomical features of the CRNs that contribute to a better understanding of the circuitry of the ASR in the rat...|$|R

40|$|The {{nature of}} culture-specific startles syndromes such as "Latah" in Indonesia and Malaysia is ill understood. Hypotheses {{concerning}} their origin include sociocultural behavior, psychiatric disorders, and neurological syndromes. The various disorders show striking similarities despite occurring in diverse cultural settings and genetically distant populations. They are characterized clinically by exaggerated startle responses and involuntary vocalizations, echolalia, and echopraxia. Quantifying startle reflexes may help define Latah within the 3 groups of startle syndromes: (1) hyperekplexia, (2) startle-induced disorders, and (3) neuropsychiatric startle syndromes. Twelve female Latah patients (mean age, 44. 6 years; SD, 7. 7 years) and 12 age-, sex- and socioeconomically matched controls (mean age, 42. 3 year; SD, 8. 0) were studied using structured history taking and neurological examination including provocation of vocalizations, echolalia, and echopraxia. We quantified <b>auditory</b> startle <b>reflexes</b> with electromyographic activity of 6 left-sided muscles following 104 -dB tones.

Early as well as late motor startle responses were significantly increased in patients compared with controls (P ≤. 05). Following their startle response, Latah patients showed stereotyped responses including vocalizations and echo phenomena. Startle responses were increased, but clinically these proved insignificant compared with the stereotyped behavioral responses following the startle response. This study supports the classification of Latah as a "neuropsychiatric startle syndrome. ...|$|R
40|$|A working {{model of}} the {{neurophysiology}} of hypnosis suggests that highly hypnotizable individuals (HHs) have more effective frontal attentional systems implementing control, monitoring performance, and inhibiting unwanted stimuli from conscious awareness, than low hypnotizable individuals (LHs). Recent studies, using prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the <b>auditory</b> startle <b>reflex</b> (ASR), suggest that HHs, in the waking condition, may show reduced sensory gating although they may selectively attend and disattend different stimuli. Using a within subject design and a strict subject selection procedure, in waking and hypnosis conditions we tested whether HHs compared to LHs showed a significantly lower inhibition of the ASR and startle-related brain activity in both time and intracerebral source localization domains. HHs, as compared to LH participants, exhibited (a) longer latency of the eyeblink startle reflex, (b) reduced N 100 responses to startle stimuli, and (c) higher PPI of eyeblink startle and of the P 200 and P 300 waves. Hypnosis yielded smaller N 100 waves to startle stimuli and greater PPI of this component than in the waking condition. sLORETA analysis revealed that, for the N 100 (107 msec) elicited during startle trials, HHs had a smaller activation in the left parietal lobe (BA 2 / 40) than LHs. Auditory pulses of pulse-with prepulse trials in HHs yielded less activity of the P 300 (280 msec) wave than LHs, in the cingulate and posterior cingulate gyrus (BA 23 / 31). The present results, on the whole, are {{in the opposite direction}} to PPI findings on hypnotizability previously reported in the literature. These results provide support to the neuropsychophysiological model that HHs hav...|$|R
40|$|Ten {{patients}} {{presented as}} children or young adults with hearing impairments that, by behavioural and physiological testing, we compatible with a disorder of the auditory {{portion of the}} VIII cranial nerve. Evidence of normal cochlear outer hair cell function was provided by preservation of otoacoustic emissions and cochlear microphonics {{in all of the}} patients. Auditory brainstem potentials showed evidence of abnormal auditory pathway function beginning with the VIII nerve: the potentials were absent in nine patients and severely distorted in one patient. <b>Auditory</b> brainstem <b>reflexes</b> (middle ear muscles; crossed suppression of otoacoustic emissions) were absent in all of the tested patients. Behavioural audiometric testing showed a mild to moderate elevation of pure tone threshold in nine patients. The extent of the hearing loss, if due to cochlear receptor damage, should not have resulted in the loss of auditory brainstem potentials. The shape of the pure tone loss varied, being predominantly low frequency in five patients, flat across all frequencies in three patients and predominantly high frequency in two patients. Speech intelligibility was tested in eight patients, and in six was affected out of proportion to what would have been expected if the pure tone loss were of cochlear origin. The patients were otherwise neurologically normal when the hearing impairment was first manifest. Subsequently, eight of these patients developed evidence for a peripheral neuropathy. The neuropathy was hereditary in three and sporadic in five. We suggest that this type of hearing impairment is due to a disorder of auditory nerve function and may have, as one of its causes, a neuropathy of the auditory nerve, occurring either in isolation or as part of a generalized neuropathic process...|$|R
40|$|The age {{at which}} {{children}} are receiving cochlear implants has dropped dramatically; some children now undergo surgery when less than 12 months old. Considerable feedback is required from the patient in order to set the device optimally. This can be difficult in very young children, who {{may be unable to}} provide any behavioral information. It is therefore vital that objective measures are available in order to evaluate the device and auditory system function, set the programming parameters, and even assess performance. This book covers cochlear implant objective measures used before, during and after surgery. It provides a handbook for clinicians detailing the many techniques currently used, including telemetry, averaged electrode voltages, and electrically–evoked stapedial <b>reflexes,</b> <b>auditory</b> brainstem responses, compound action potentials, middle, late and event–related potentials. The internationally respected chapter authors from Europe and the USA provide coverage of the objective measures used in several commercially available cochlear implant devices.

40|$|Post-traumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) patients {{are considered to}} have excessive EMG responses in the orbicularis oculi (OO) muscle and excessive autonomic responses to startling stimuli. The aim {{of the present study}} was to gain more insight into the pattern of the generalized <b>auditory</b> startle <b>reflex</b> (ASR). Reflex EMG responses to auditory startling stimuli in seven muscles rather than the EMG response of the OO alone as well as the psychogalvanic reflex (PGR) were studied in PTSD patients and healthy controls. Ten subjects with chronic PTSD (> 3 months) and a history of excessive startling and 11 healthy controls were included. Latency, amplitude and duration of the EMG responses and the amplitude of the PGR to 10 auditory stimuli of 110 dB SPL were investigated in seven left-sided muscles. The size of the startle reflex, defined by the number of muscles activated by the acoustic stimulus and by the amplitude of the EMG response of the OO muscle as well, did not differ significantly between patients and controls. Median latencies of activity in the sternocleidomastoid (SC) (patients 80 ms; controls 54 ms) and the deltoid (DE) muscles (patients 113 ms; controls 69 ms) were prolonged significantly in PTSD compared to controls (P < 0. 05). In the OO muscle, a late response (median latency in patients 308 ms; in controls 522 ms), probably the orienting reflex, was more frequently present in patients (56 %) than in controls (12 %). In patients, the mean PGR was enlarged compared to controls (P < 0. 05). The size of the ASR response is not enlarged in PTSD patients. EMG latencies in the PTSD patients are prolonged in SC and DE muscles. The presence of a late response in the OO muscle discriminates between groups of PTSD patients with a history of startling and healthy controls. In addition, the autonomic response, i. e. the enlarged amplitude of the PGR can discriminate between these group...|$|R
40|$|Background: Young {{patients}} with anxiety disorders {{are thought to}} have a hypersensitive fear system, including alterations of the early sensorimotor processing of threatening information. However, there is equivocal support in auditory blink response studies for an enlarged <b>auditory</b> startle <b>reflex</b> (ASR) in such patients. We sought to investigate the ASR measured over multiple muscles (whole-body) in children and adolescents with anxiety disorders. Methods: Between August and December 2006, we assessed ASRs (elicited by 8 consecutive tones of 104 dB, interstimulus interval of about 2 min) in 25 patients and 25 matched controls using a case-control design and in 9 nonaffected siblings. We recorded the electromyographic activity of 6 muscles and the sympathetic skin response. We investigated response occurrence (probability %) and response magnitude (area under the curve in mu V x ms) of the combined response of 6 muscles and of the single blink response. Results: In patients (17 girls, mean age 12 years; 13 social phobia, 9 generalized anxiety, 3 other), the combined response probability (p = 0. 027) of all muscles, the combined area under the curve of all muscles (p = 0. 011) and the sympathetic skin response (p = 0. 006) were enlarged compared with matched controls. The response probability (p = 0. 48) and area under the curve (p = 0. 07) of the blink response were normal in patients compared with controls. The ASR pattern was normal with normal latencies in patients compared with controls. In nonaffected siblings, the sympathetic skin response (p = 0. 038), but not the combined response probability of all muscles (p = 0. 15), was enlarged compared with controls. Limitations: Limitations are the sample size and restricted comparison to the psychophysiological ASR paradigm. Conclusion: The results point toward a hypersensitive central nervous system (fear system), including early sensorimotor processing alterations and autonomic hyperreactivity. The multiple muscle (whole-body) ASR is suggested to be a better tool to detect ASR abnormalities in {{patients with}} anxiety disorders than the blink response alone. Abnormalities in ASR serve as a candidate endophenotype of anxiety disorder...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Auditory</b> Startle <b>Reflex</b> (ASR) is a {{transient}} motor response {{mediated by the}} brainstem to an unexpected, intense acoustic stimulus. It represents a sensitive, non-invasive measurement of central nervous system activity and {{can be applied to}} assess auditory function and cerebral gating ability. During ASR measurement, the latency, intensity and duration of the reaction to a sudden short acoustic signal is quantified, the habituation to a repeated signal is assessed and the pre-pulse inhibition (the reduced startle reflex after a "warning" signal) can be measured. Increases in the response to acoustic stimuli and a shorter latency are described in Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and fragile X-syndrome while a decrease or lack in habituation can be seen in post-traumatic stress disorder and schizophrenia. In order to track the development of reflex response in juvenile rats, litters of juvenile Wistar WU were exposed to a pre-defined program of acoustic stimuli at 10, 15, 20, 40 and 60 days post partum (pp) and the intensity and duration of the response to acoustic stimuli as well as the progress in pre-pulse inhibition and habituation were measured. Our results demonstrate the practicability of ASR measurements as early as day 10 pp with a coordinated animal response showing a significant pre-pulse inhibition around day 15 pp, in coincidence with ear and eye opening. During the juvenile period of hyperactivity and -reactivity (around day 15 - 20 pp) the juvenile rats show high intensity reactions with a long duration. The development of a gender-specific response starts around day 40 pp in coincidence with sexual maturation, with females demonstrating a higher degree of habituation and pre-pulse inhibition. Adult-like patterns of habituation can be assessed by day 60 pp. In contrast to general experimental habit (assessing ASR at weaning and day 60 pp), our data demonstrate the practicability of ASR measurement at day 15 pp with comparable results, enabling an earlier assessment of cerebral function...|$|R
40|$|The {{environmental}} contaminant, trimethyltin (TMT), {{produces a}} profound elevation in tone intensity necessary to inhibit the acoustic startle reflex in laboratory animals which recovers over {{a prolonged period}} except at very high frequencies. The recovery that is observed does not begin until 3 to 5 weeks after a single acute administration depending upon dosage. As opposed to the very temporary threshold shifts by the salicylates and loop diuretics or the permanent and progressive ototoxicity resulting from aminoglycoside antibiotics the time course for recovery of acoustic startle reflex inhibition after TMT {{appears to be an}} anomaly for a chemical ototoxicant. In terms of the duration of loss only, this pattern appears similar to that sometimes observed after noise exposure. The current investigation replicates the finding that recovery of acoustic startle reflex inhibition after TMT is frequency related in that only the highest frequency impairment appears to be permanent. While this frequency dependence suggests a cochlear locus of injury, both the known neurotoxic effects of TMT and the time course of the behavioral impairment suggest a more central locus of injury. Compound action potential and cochlear microphonic recordings made from the round window in the current study confirm a preferential high frequency effect of TMT and demonstrate a significant cochlear component to the ototoxic effects of this agent. ototoxicity, peripheral <b>auditory</b> damage, trimethyltin, <b>reflex</b> modification audiometry, compound action potential, cochlear microphoni...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRetrograde transneuronal tracing with {{rabies virus}} {{from the right}} orbicularis oculi muscle was used to {{identify}} neural networks underlying spontaneous, reflex, and learned blinks. The kinetics of viral transfer was studied at sequential 12 hr intervals between 3 and 5 d after inoculation. Rabies virus immunolabeling was combined with the immunohistochemical detection of choline acetyltransferase expression in brainstem motoneurons or Fluoro-Ruby injections in the rubrospinal tract. Virus uptake involved exclusively orbicularis oculi motoneurons in the dorsolateral division of the facial nucleus. At 3 - 3. 5 d, transneuronal transfer involved premotor interneurons of trigeminal, <b>auditory,</b> and vestibular <b>reflex</b> pathways (in medullary and pontine reticular formation, trigeminal nuclei, periolivary and ventral cochlear nuclei, and medial vestibular nuclei), motor pathways (dorsolateral quadrant of contralateral red nucleus and pararubral area), deep cerebellar nuclei (lateral portion of interpositus nucleus and dorsolateral hump ipsilaterally), limbic relays (parabrachial and K?ker-Fuse nuclei), and oculomotor structures involved in eye-eyelid coordination (oculomotor nucleus, supraoculomotor area, and interstitial nucleus of Cajal). At 4 d, higher order neurons were revealed in trigeminal, auditory, vestibular, and deep cerebellar nuclei (medial, interpositus, and lateral), oculomotor and visual-related structures (Darkschewitsch, nucleus of the posterior commissure, deep layers of superior colliculus, and pretectal area), lateral hypothalamus, and cerebral cortex (particularly in parietal areas). At 4. 5 and 5 d the labeling of higher order neurons occurred in hypothalamus, cerebral cortex, and blink-related areas of cerebellar cortex. These results provide a comprehensive picture of the premotor networks mediating reflex, voluntary, and limbic-related eyelid responses and highlight potential sites of motor learning in eyelid classical conditioning...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Modern society's {{constant}} {{exposure to}} electro-magnetic fields has raised {{a number of}} concerns including possible effects on developing organ systems and reproduction. Especially {{in the range of}} extremely low frequencies epidemiological and experimental data are not consistent. The presented data show the results of a pre- and postnatal exposure study in 2 sub-sets performed on behalf of the German Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS) in an animal model with magnetic field ranges covering epidemiological threshold values for children as well as occupational safety limits. Methods: Time-mated CD- 1 mice were exposed to 50 Hz sinusoidal magnetic fields of 10 MicroT, 1 mT or 10 mT continuously for 20 h/d starting gestational day 10. Two additional control groups were either cage controls or sham exposed. Temperature, relative humidity and noise level were controlled and did not differ between experimental groups. Dams were allowed to litter naturally and litters were standardized at postnatal day (PND) 4 - 8 pups. Litters were weaned PND 21 and the animals group housed afterwards. Clinical observations were performed daily and bodyweight measurements at PND 4, 7, 10, 14, 17, 21 and weekly afterwards up to PND 90. In a second subset with analogous set-up, additionally reflex ontogenesis was tested PND 1 - 3 for surface righting and PND 10 - 12 for negative geotaxis. Spontaneous locomotor activity and functional observational battery were tested PND 20, 30 and 60, <b>auditory</b> startle <b>reflex</b> with habituation and pre-pulse inhibition at PND 20 and 60. Vaginal opening and the corresponding bodyweight were assessed PND 22 - 30. Differences between experimental groups were considered statistically significant when p < 0. 05. ANOVA and Dunnett's test or Chi Square testing were performed depending on data type. Results: The exposure did not affect maternal clinical findings, bodyweight or delivery data. Pre- and postnatal mortality were low and did not differ between exposure and control groups. Pup bodyweight development did not differ between sham and field exposure groups but was slightly elevated or decreased (1 sub-study each) in cage controls. No differences were seen in reflex development and behavioural testings. No dose-related effect was seen in age at vaginal opening but the parameter was achieved at a higher bodyweight in all exposure groups and cage controls in comparison to sham controls, again with no apparent dose-relation. Conclusion: The presented data do not imply a detrimental effect of extremely low frequency magnetic fields on the reproductive performance, any teratogenic effects, the postnatal survival or reflex and behavioural development...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aim: Hyperbilirubinemia {{during the}} {{neonatal}} period {{is known to}} be an important risk factor for neonatal auditory impairment, and may reveal as a permanent brain damage, if no proper therapeutic intervention is considered. In the present study some electroacoustic and electrophysiologic tests were used to evaluate function of auditory system in a group of children with severe neonatal Jaundice. Materials and Methods: Forty five children with mean age of 16. 1 14. 81 months and 17 mg/dl and higher bilirubin level were studied, and the transient evoked otoacoustic emission, acoustic <b>reflex,</b> <b>auditory</b> brainstem response and auditory steady-state response tests were performed for them. Results: The mean score of bilirubin was 29. 37 8. 95 mg/dl. It was lower than 20 mg/dl in 22. 2 %, between 20 - 30 mg/dl in 24. 4 % and more than 30 mg/dl in 48. 0 % of children. No therapeutic intervention in 26. 7 %, phototherapy in 44. 4 %, and blood exchange in 28. 9 % of children were reported. 48. 9 % hypoxia and 26. 6 % preterm birth history was shown too. TEOAEs was recordable in 71. 1 % of cases. The normal result in acoustic reflex, ABR and ASSR tests was shown just in 11. 1 % of cases. The clinical symptoms of auditory neuropathy were revealed in 57. 7 % of children. Conclusion: Conducting auditory tests sensitive to hyperbilirubinemia place of injury is necessary to inform from functional effect and severity of disorder. Because the auditory neuropathy/ dys-synchrony is common in neonates with hyperbilirubinemic, the OAEs and ABR are the minimum essential tests to identify this disorder...|$|R

Here, we report {{the results of a}} test, run as a smartphone application (app), assessing <b>auditory</b> and visual <b>reflexes</b> in a sample of 300 drivers. The scope of the test is to provide both the police force and medication-taking drivers with a tool that can evaluate the individual’s capacity to drive safely. Methods: The test is run as an app for Apple iOS and Android mobile operating systems and facilitates four different reaction times to be assessed: simple visual and auditory reaction times and complex visual and auditory reaction times. Reference deciles were created for the test results obtained from a sample of 300 Italian subjects. Results lying within the first three deciles were considered as incompatible with safe driving capabilities. Results: Performance is both age-related (r> 0. 5) and sex-related (female reaction times were significantly slower than those recorded for male subjects, P< 0. 05). Only 21 % of the subjects were able to perform all four tests correctly. Conclusion: We developed and fine-tuned a test called Safedrive that measures visual and auditory reaction times through a smartphone mobile device; the scope of the test is two-fold: to provide a clinical tool for the assessment of the driving capacity of individuals taking pain relief medication; to promote the sense of social responsibility in drivers who are on medication and provide these individuals with a means of testing their own capacity to drive safely.
