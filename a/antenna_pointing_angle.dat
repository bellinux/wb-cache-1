40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the theoretical model for short pulse scattering from a statistically random planar surface with particular application to current state of the art radar altimetry. A short review of the assumptions inherent in the convolutional model is presented. Simplified expressions are obtained for both the impulse response and the average backscattered power for near normal incidence under the assumptions common to satellite radar altimetry systems. In particular, it is shown that the conventional two-dimensional surface integration can be reduced to a closed form solution. Two applications of these results are presented relative to radar altimetry, namely, radar <b>antenna</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>angle</b> determination and altitude bias correction for pointing angle and surface roughness effects. It is also shown that these results have direct application to the analysis of the two frequency system proposed by Weissman, and a possible combined long pulse altimeter and two frequency system is suggested...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The idea {{of using}} the Radon {{transform}} to measure the alignment of linear features in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data has breathed {{new life into the}} “look displacement ” class of Doppler ambiguity resolution algorithms. In these algorithms, the slope of target energy is estimated to obtain the satellite beam pointing angle accurately enough to resolve the Doppler ambiguity. After explaining the method and adding some minor improvements, it is shown how it can work well on satellite SAR data. Then, an alternate method is developed that combines the ideas of the Radon and look displacement algorithms to obtain a computationally simpler and more accurate algorithm. In addition, the quality checks of the “spatial diversity ” approach are used to increase the robustness of the algorithm. Even though the algorithm was conceived for high-contrast scenes, it works remarkably well in low to medium contrast scenes as well.

The 28 GHz measurements did not systematically seek the optimum <b>antenna</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>angles</b> and resulted in 33 % outage for 39 T-R separation distances within 200 m. The 73 GHz measurements systematically found the best <b>antenna</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>angles</b> and resulted in 14. 3 % outage for 35 T-R separation distances within 200 m, all for mobile height receivers. <b>Pointing</b> the <b>antennas</b> to yield the strongest received power is shown to significantly reduce RMS delay spreads in line-of-sight (LOS) environments. A new term, distance extension exponent (DEE) is defined, and used to mathematically describe the increase in coverage distance that results by combining beams from angles with the strongest received power at a given location. These results suggest that employing directionality in millimeter-wave communications systems will reduce inter-symbol interference, improve link margin at cell edges, and enhance overall system performance.

40|$|Abstract—The multilook beat {{frequency}} (MLBF) algorithm is the Doppler centroid estimator {{most commonly used}} in practice to solve the Doppler ambiguity. However, it still makes errors, notably in medium- or low-contrast scenes. In this paper, we present two {{ways in which the}} estimation sensitivity of the MLBF algorithm can be improved. First, we give a more thorough frequencydomain explanation of how the MLBF algorithm works and explain how cross beating and range migration cause estimation difficulties. The first improvement to the algorithm replaces the fast Fourier transform (FFT) -based {{beat frequency}} estimator with a more accurate one that uses phase increments. It avoids the FFT limitations of resolution and quantization, especially when the signal is discontinuous in one range cell due to range cell migration or burst mode operation (ScanSAR). A second improvement uses range cell migration correction to straighten the target trajectories before the beat frequency estimator is applied. This has the effect of narrowing the bandwidth of the beat signal and reducing the effect of cross beating. Finally, experiments with RADARSAT- 1 data are used to illustrate the improved estimation accuracy of the modified algorithm.

40|$|<b>Antenna</b> <b>{{pointing}}</b> <b>angle</b> is {{the core}} {{of the quality of the}} transmitted/received signal. Since most of the antennas work in an outdoor environment, their pointing angles might be subjected to different types of disturbances- specifically wind gust- that might deviate them from their correct positions. The process of the position re-correction might be difficult especially if this is done manually due to the precision needed, and sometimes the location of the antenna, as well as its size, are another challenging issues that make the manual correction more difficult. This work is a study and design of a control system that can carry the antenna to the required position as well as fix it on that position by resisting the disturbances. The resistance and the removal of the effect of disturbances require a closed loop control system and application of control algorithm (The one that is used here is Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller). The total work is a simulation and real-time prototyping implantation of an antenna control system that is made of two motors to drive the azimuth and elevation subsystems. An Arduino Mega 2560 board is used as a controller through which the PID control algorithm and the other control commands will be performed.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{assisting}} the tracking antenna during a satellite {{pass over the}} tracking ground station is addressed in this work. The assisted tracking provides the <b>antenna</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>angles</b> so as to allow AOS (acquisition of signal), and to avoid or minimize loss of communication with a reduced computation time. It estimates two orbit elements: the mean anomaly and the right ascension of the ascending node. The other keplerian elements are considered constant. Whenever the communication with the satellite is established (locked), the assisted tracking process transforms the measured input tracking angles in {{an estimate of the}} mean anomaly and right ascension. The process was simulated in a digital computer for different tracking situations. It was supposed that in a given instant, the signal was lost.

40|$|An {{iterative}} method {{has been used}} to produce rain-rate estimates for an attenuating frequency radar. An infinite number of higher-order estimates are shown to converge in the limit to the Hitschfeld-Bordan solution under certain conditions. An error analysis was performed by a model accounting for the randomness of the radar return power, the k-Z, Z-R relations, and offsets in the radar calibration constant. Since the behavior of the estimates strongly depends on system errors, the choice of the best estimate requires a knowledge of the variance and range of offsets in meteorological data and the calibration constant. As the errors increase, the use of the lower orders avoids significant overpredictions. In order to obtain reliable rain-rate predictions in the presence of realistic errors, an <b>antenna</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>angles</b> away from the horizontal at frequencies in {{the lower end of the}} X-band may be used.

40|$|The radar (an {{acronym for}} radio {{detection}} and ranging) is an instrument developed {{just before the}} WW-II to precisely measure the position of an object (target) in space. This is done by emitting a narrow pulse of electromagnetic energy in the RF spectrum, receiving the return echo and measuring the time of flight in the two-way path from the emitter to the target. The propagation delay provides {{a measure of the}} range to the target, which is not in itself sufficient to uniquely locate the position of the same in space. However, if a directional antenna is used, the direction of the echo can be assessed by the <b>antenna</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>angles.</b> In this way the position of the target can be uniquely determined in space.

40|$|Since the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) {{satellite}} {{launch in}} November 1997, the TRMM Satellite Validation Office (TSVO) at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has been performing quality control and estimating rainfall from the KPOL S-band radar at Kwajalein, Republic of the Marshall Islands. Over this period, KPOL has incurred many episodes of calibration and <b>antenna</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>angle</b> uncertainty. To address these issues, the TSVO has applied the Relative Calibration Adjustment (RCA) technique {{to eight years}} of KPOL radar data to produce Ground Validation (GV) Version 7 products. This application has significantly improved stability in KPOL reflectivity distributions needed for Probability Matching Method (PMM) rain rate estimation and for comparisons to the TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR). In years with significant calibration and angle corrections, the statistical improvement in PMM distributions is dramatic. The intent {{of this paper is}} to show improved stability in corrected KPOL reflectivity distributions by using the PR as a stable reference. Inter-month fluctuations in mean reflectivity differences between the PR and corrected KPOL are on the order of 1 - 2 dB, and inter-year mean reflectivity differences fluctuate by approximately 1 dB. This represents a marked improvement in stability with confidence comparable to the established calibration and uncertainty boundaries of the PR. The practical application of the RCA method has salvaged eight years of radar data that would have otherwise been unusable, and has made possible a high-quality database of tropical ocean-based reflectivity measurements and precipitation estimates for the research community...|$|E
40|$|The {{secondary}} {{surveillance radar}} (SSR), that is an evolution of the military identification friend-or-foe systems, is widely used by {{air traffic control service}} providers to localize and identify co-operating aircraft equipped with a standard transponder [1]. The ground SSR installation transmits interrogations, from a rotating, narrow azimuthal beam antenna. The airborne transponders, once they have received an interrogation, transmit at a 1, 090 -MHz carrier a reply signal containing the requested data, i. e., identity (mode A reply) or fight level (mode C reply). Azimuth and range of the aircraft are measured by the interrogator, based on the delay of the reply and on the <b>antenna</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>angle.</b> The current SSR standard is based on the use of selective interrogations and replies and is called mode S: to reduce the interferences, the mode S protocol is based on a message format that includes the unique address of the aircraft. The airborne segment of the SSR is composed of the transponder and a pair of antennas on top and {{on the bottom of the}} fuselage. As the aircraft antennas are omnidirectional, many ground stations can receive the replies. This allowed the development of multilateration (MLAT) systems for the aircraft localization based on 1, 090 -MHz signals [2]. A typical MLAT system is composed of a distributed network of 1, 090 -MHz sensors, an interconnecting facility, and a central processor for the fusion of the sensor data. The data fusion relies on the estimation of the signals arrival time at the different stations and on hyperbolic localization. To identify the emitters, the processing is done with mode A replies or mode S replies that contain the emitter identity. A transponder with mode S capability can also transmit a particular downlink format message, called squitter, containing the aircraft's unique address and other information. The squitter signals are not elicited by the SSR interrogation, but they are spontaneously emitted at pseudoperiodical intervals. They are the basis of the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) concept [3]: the ADS-B OUT function periodically transmits information (identity, position, state, etc.) about the aircraft, and the ADS-B IN function receives the messages from nearby traffic. On the airborne side, the ADS-B OUT broadcasts data with onboard equipment using the squitter signals. The airborne ADS-B IN equipment provides to the pilot the traffic scenario, receiving the messages from ground and nearby aircraft ADS-B OUT. Moreover, the ADS-B IN can receive other ground services: the traffic information services-broadcast (TIS-B) and the fight information services-broadcast (FIS-B) [3]. Airport vehicles can be equipped with an ADS-B OUT, a simplified, nonflyable device transmitting 1, 090 -MHz squitter signals containing the identity and the position. As a matter of fact, there are various users of the 1, 090 -MHz channel: 1) SSR transponder replies (modes A, C, S); 2) ADS-B OUT messages; 3) MLAT systems with interrogation capability; and 4) TIS-B.

40|$|For {{planetary}} lander missions, {{the most}} challenging phase of the spacecraft to ground communications is during the entry, descent, and landing (EDL). As each 2003 Mars Exploration Rover (MER) enters the Martian atmosphere, it slows dramatically. The extreme acceleration and jerk cause extreme Doppler dynamics on the X-band signal received on Earth. When the vehicle slows sufficiently, the parachute is deployed, causing almost a step in deceleration. After parachute deployment, the lander is lowered beneath the parachute on a bridle. The swinging motion of the lander imparts high Doppler dynamics on the signal and causes the received signal strength to vary widely, due to changing <b>antenna</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>angles.</b> All this time, the vehicle transmits important health and status information that is especially critical if the landing is not successful. Even using the largest Deep Space Network antennas, the weak signal and high dynamics render it impossible to conduct reliable phase coherent communications.

The measurements consisted of ten random receiver locations at pedestrian level (1. 4 meters) and ten random transmitter locations at lamppost level (4. 0 meters) that provided 36 individual transmitter-receiver (TX-RX) combinations. For each of the 36 radio links, extensive directional measurements were made to give insights into small-cell base station diversity at millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands. High-gain steerable horn antennas with 7 -degree and 15 -degree half-power beamwidths (HPBW) were used at the transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX), respectively. For each TX-RX combination, the TX antenna was scanned over a 120 -degree sector and the RX antenna was scanned over the entire azimuth plane at the strongest RX elevation plane and two other elevation planes {{on both sides of}} the strongest elevation angle, separated by the 15 -degree HPBW.
