Move ordering is an optimization for <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> <b>pruning</b> that attempts to guess the most probable child nodes that yield the node's score. The algorithm searches those child nodes first. The result of good guesses is earlier and more frequent alpha/beta cut offs occur, thereby pruning additional game tree branches and remaining child nodes from the search tree.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Traditionally chess gaming {{software}} takes {{considerable amount}} of time in calculating the optimal move that can be made by a computer system. Most computer systems that make such calculations use some version of the minimax search with <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> <b>pruning.</b> Minimax with <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> <b>pruning</b> can be made distributed with principal variation splitting. The system can thus be used to reduce the time necessary to calculate the optimal move. Additionally, to select the distributed node containing less workload from the grid, a dynamic CPU availability prediction can be deployed to enhance the performance of task (searching game tree to find the optimal move) execution. An algorithm for dynamic monitoring of CPU has been proposed and discussed in this paper besides PV-Splitting minimum and maximum algorithms. Prediction of CPU availability is important in the context of making task assignment and scheduling decisions. Extensive experimental studies and statistical analysis are performed to evaluate the performance improvement of the model using the chess software system which uses the PV-Splitting for task parallelism...|$|E

We {{propose the}} novel concept of ‘group chess’, with the objective of using information technology as an educational aid for novice chess players, as well as for experienced players to play as groups.

Artificial intelligence and networking technologies are used in the system. The <b>Alpha</b> <b>Beta</b> <b>pruning</b> algorithm is used to find the best movement out of a set of given inputs. This is a new adaptation of the <b>Alpha</b> <b>Beta</b> <b>pruning</b> which is normally used to find the best possible move.

We use a {{combination}} of propagation, lookahead and heuristics and show how all three improve performance. For adversarial opponents we show that we can achieve promising results through good lookahead and heuristics and that a version of <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> <b>pruning</b> performs strongly. For random opponents, we show that we can frequently achieve solutions even on problems which lack a winning strategy and that we can improve our success rate by using Existential Quantified Generalised Arc Consistency, a lower level of consistency than SQGAC, to maximise pruning without removing solutions. We also consider the power of the universal opponent and show that through good heuristic selection we can generate a significantly stronger player than a static heuristic provides. ...|$|E

Various combinations of <b>alpha,</b> <b>beta,</b> gamma, and delta subunit RNAs were injected into oocytes, and membrane currents elicited by AcCho were recorded under voltage clamp. Judging by the amplitudes of AcCho currents generated, {{the levels of}} functional receptor expression were: <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> gamma delta > <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> delta > <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> gamma > <b>alpha</b> gamma delta. The <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> gamma delta and <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> delta AcChoR Subtypes were strongly blocked by 5 HT, whereas the <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> gamma receptor was blocked only slightly.

For program purposes I created "block oriented" position representation, I implemented simpliffied static analysis of life and death of the group and I proposed a set of heuristic.

40|$|<b>Alpha</b> <b>Beta</b> <b>Pruning</b> is an {{algorithm}} {{to prune}} unnecessary branches. The idea of not exploring the branches {{if we know}} that it is worthless makes it a powerful algorithm ever invented. The algorithm is useful in some of the game search available today. Meanwhile, the ability of greedy algorithm to solve problem by choosing any alternatives that leads to the optimal solution without having care of what will happen after that as long as it achieves its goal makes it suitable in any game it applies. Some of the games are checkers. Checkers uses game search to find the solution to win the game. There are many available locations that the pieces can move in the board. It makes it difficult for the player to determine the next move that it should go to win the game. This game will be used to compare both algorithm based on time and the number of moves it takes to win the game. By applying both algorithms, we can determine which algorithm is the most powerful algorithm to generate the winning strategies in the game of checkers. The result will also show how the algorithms generate the winning solution...|$|E
40|$|HLA-DR {{molecules}} are heterodimeric transmembrane glycoproteins that associate intracellularly with a polypeptide {{known as}} the invariant (I) chain. Shortly before expression of the HLA-DR <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> dimer on the cell surface, however, the I chain {{is removed from the}} intracellular <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> I complex by a mechanism thought to involve proteolysis. In this report, we show that treatment of purified <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> I with the cysteine proteinase cathepsin B results in the specific proteolysis of the HLA-DR-associated I chain in vitro. As a consequence of this, the I chain is removed and free <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> dimers are released from <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> I. Although <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> I fails to bind an immunogenic peptide, the released <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> dimers acquire the ability to bind the peptide after proteolysis of the I chain.

Although {{it is known that}} gamma binds tightly to <b>alpha</b> <b>beta,</b> the binding affinity for each gamma subunit to <b>alpha</b> <b>beta,</b> the domains on gamma that interact with <b>alpha</b> <b>beta,</b> and the allosteric interactions between gamma and the regulatory and catalytic regions on <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> are not well understood. We show here that the gamma subunit binds to two distinct sites on the catalytic <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> dimer (K-D 1 to <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> is absent when cAMP occupies the noncatalytic sites. Two major domains on gamma can interact independently with <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> with the N-terminal half of gamma binding with 50 -fold greater affinity than its C-terminal, inhibitory region.

Using synthetic peptides, we identified regions of the amino acid sequence of gamma that bind to <b>alpha</b> <b>beta,</b> restore high affinity cGMP binding to low affinity noncatalytic sites, and retard cGMP exchange with both noncatalytic sites.

Recent {{evidence suggests that}} insulin and IGF-I half-receptors can heterologously assemble to form <b>alpha</b> 2 <b>beta</b> 2 insulin/IGF-I hybrid receptor complexes in vivo and in vitro. We have utilized hybrid receptor complexes to examine ligand-stimulated transmembrane signaling of wild-type insulin (<b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> INS. WT) or IGF-I (<b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> IGF. WT) half-receptors assembled with a kinase-defective insulin half-receptor mutant (<b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> INS. A/K). In vitro assembly of either (<b>alpha</b> <b>beta)</b> IGF. WT/(alpha beta) INS. A/K or (<b>alpha</b> <b>beta)</b> INS. WT/(alpha beta) INS. A/K hybrid receptors resulted in decreased substrate protein kinase activity. The degree of protein kinase inactivation directly correlated {{with the amount of}} immunologically cross-reactive hybrid receptors formed. In contrast to substrate kinase activity, insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of the (<b>alpha</b> <b>beta)</b> INS. WT/(alpha beta) INS.

40|$|Project (M. S., Computer Science) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. Games are an {{interesting}} field of study in field of artificial intelligence. Minimax search is a game theory applied to game playing and it {{has proved to be}} successful for many games but not all. One of them is the Game of Go. Go is an ancient Chinese Game usually played on 19 x 19 board. It is a 2 -player game where the objective is to capture the opponent???s stones and control as many territories as possible to win the game. Go has its own set of challenges that makes it difficult for Minimax to be efficient. Some of the challenges of Computer Go involve huge branching factor and difficulty {{to come up with an}} optimal evaluation function for the leaf nodes. The objective of this project is to implement a system that combines the Selective Minimax search and the Neural Network to evolve the Computer Go player. The limitations of Minimax approach are addressed by using the concepts of Selective Minimax tree and <b>Alpha</b> <b>Beta</b> <b>Pruning.</b> Selective Minimax search provides focused search space and faster evaluation of the moves for the computer. The idea of Selective Minimax is to search and evaluate only those moves that look promising among the legal moves or empty intersections. The Neural Network is trained using supervised learning and Resilient Backpropagation is used for the learning process. The learning method of Resilient Backpropagation proves to be faster and more efficient than the standard Backpropagation for the game of Go. The trained Neural Network combined with an evaluation function is used to evaluate the leaf nodes of the Selective Minimax tree. For Minimax to suggest an optimal move for the computer, it would need to search at greater depths to look ahead which in result would be very costly. For Neural Network to suggest an optimal move, it would need many data and game records to recognize patterns from the board that might not be feasible. Using the hybrid method, the Neural Network helps Minimax to look ahead and the static evaluation function helps Neural Network to suggest a sensible move in case of unseen patterns. This hybrid method provides an advantage over Minimax search as the learning and the experience of Neural Network helps to look ahead without actually searching at greater depths and helps to avoid falling for local maxima. NNGo 9 x 9 uses the hybrid method of Neural Network and Selective Minimax and proves to be an effective player which minimizes the drawbacks of each method. Computer Scienc...|$|E

Cross-linking in conjunction with reimmunoprecipitation indicated that larger multi-component <b>alpha</b> 3 <b>beta</b> 1 /TM 4 /TM 4 complexes (<b>alpha</b> 3 <b>beta</b> 1 /CD 9 /CD 63, <b>alpha</b> 3 <b>beta</b> 1 /CD 81 /CD 63, and <b>alpha</b> 3 <b>beta</b> 1 /CD 9 /CD 81) also could be detected on the cell surface. Immunofluorescent staining showed redistribution of <b>alpha</b> 3 <b>beta</b> 1 /TM 4 complexes toward the periphery of cells plated on various extracellular matrix substrates and also showed that these complexes were localized in cell footprints. Staining of human tissues yielded additional results consistent with co-localization of <b>alpha</b> 3 <b>beta</b> 1 and CD 9, CD 63, and CD 81 proteins. In conclusion we suggest that the prevalence of integrin/TM 4 complexes in diverse cellular environments is indicative of their general physiological importance...|$|R

We utilized 125 I-insulin affinity cross-linking to examine the structural properties of insulin receptors from rat liver and turkey erythrocyte membranes prepared in the absence and presence of sulphydryl alkylating agents. Rat liver membranes prepared in the absence of sulphydryl alkylating agents displayed specific labelling of Mr 400, 000 and 200, 000 bands, corresponding to the <b>alpha</b> 2 <b>beta</b> 2 heterotetrameric and <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> heterodimeric insulin receptor complexes respectively. In contrast, affinity cross-linking of membranes prepared with iodoacetamide (IAN) or N-ethylmaleimide identified predominantly the <b>alpha</b> 2 <b>beta</b> 2 heterotetrameric insulin receptor complex. Similarly, affinity cross-linking and solubilization of intact turkey erythrocytes in the presence of IAN resulted in exclusive labelling of the <b>alpha</b> 2 <b>beta</b> 2 heterotetrameric insulin receptor complex, whereas in the absence of IAN both <b>alpha</b> 2 <b>beta</b> 2 and <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> species were observed. Turkey erythrocyte <b>alpha</b> 2 <b>beta</b> 2 heterotetrameric insulin receptors from IAN-protected membranes displayed a 3 - 4 -fold stimulation of beta subunit autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation by insulin, equivalent to that observed in intact human placenta insulin receptors. Turkey erythrocyte <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> heterodimeric insulin receptors, prepared by defined pH/dithiothreitol treatment of IAN-protected membranes, were also fully competent in insulin-stimulated protein kinase activity compared with <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> heterodimeric human placenta receptors. In contrast, endogenous turkey erythrocyte <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> heterodimeric insulin receptors displayed basal protein kinase activity which was insulin-insensitive. These data indicate that native turkey erythrocyte and rat liver insulin receptors are structurally and functionally similar to <b>alpha</b> 2 <b>beta</b> 2 heterotetrameric human placenta insulin receptors. The <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> heterodimeric insulin receptors previously identified in these tissues most likely resulted from disulphide bond reduction and denaturation of the <b>alpha</b> 2 <b>beta</b> 2 holoreceptor complexes during membrane preparation...|$|R
40|$|A T {{lymphocyte}} expresses on {{its surface}} one of two types of antigen receptor, T-cell receptor <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> or T-cell receptor gamma delta, encoded {{by a pair of}} somatically rearranged <b>alpha</b> and <b>beta</b> or gamma and delta genes. It has been suggested that <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> T cells are generated only from precursor T cells that failed to rearrange gamma and delta genes in a functional form. However, we found that transgenic mice constructed with functionally rearranged gamma and delta genes produce a normal number of <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> T cells. The transgene gamma present in these <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> T cells is repressed apparently through an associated cis DNA element (silencer). We propose that some T-cell precursors are committed to generate <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> T cells independent of the rearrangement status of their gamma gene and that this commitment involves activation of a factor(s) that interacts with the gamma gene-associated silencer...|$|R
40|$|Circular dichroism (CD) spectra {{and density}} {{functional}} theory (DFT) calculations are reported {{for a series}} of conformationally bistable chiroporphyrins with 8 -methylene bridles MBCP- 8, which can display either an alpha alpha alpha alpha or an <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> orientation of their meso substituents. From DFT geometry optimizations, the most stable form of ZnBCP- 8 is found to be the alpha alpha alpha alpha conformer. By passing to NiBCP- 8, there is a strong stabilization of the <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> conformation with respect to the alpha alpha alpha alpha conformation, consistent with the X-ray structures of alpha alpha alpha alpha-ZnBCP- 8 and <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> <b>alpha</b> beta- NiBCP- 8. A correlation between the sign of the CD signal in the Soret region and the conformation of the BCP- 8 compounds is reported: the alpha alpha alpha alpha conformers H 2 BCP- 8 and ZnBCP- 8 show a positive CD signal, whereas the <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> conformers NiBCP- 8 and CuBCP- 8 exhibit a negative signal. The possible contributions to the rotational strengths of <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> <b>alpha</b> beta-NiBCP- 8 and alpha alpha alpha-ZnBCP 8, calculated {{on the basis of their}} crystal structures, have been analyzed. The CD signals are found to result from a combination of both the inherent chirality of the porphyrin and of extrinsic contributions due to the chiral bridles. These results may have a broad significance for understanding the chiroptical properties of chiral porphyrins and hemoproteins and for monitoring stimuli-responsive, conformationally bistable chiroporphyrin compounds...|$|R

40|$|The liver {{comprises}} unique T cells differentiating extrathymically {{and expressing}} an intermediate intensity of <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> T-cell receptor (TcR) {{and a high}} intensity of leucocyte function antigen- 1 (LFA- 1). To elucidate the functional roles of the intermediate <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> TcR cells in host defence against bacterial infection, we {{examined the effects of}} depletion of the intermediate <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> TcR cells by in vivo administration of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) /LFA- 1 and <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> TcR on the bacterial growth in the liver after infection with Salmonella chorelaesuis in mice. Pretreatment with mAb to LFA- 1 (200 micrograms/mouse) together with mAb to ICAM- 1 (200 micrograms/mouse), which could preferentially deplete the intermediate <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> TcR cells and gamma delta TcR cells in the liver, resulted in a severely reduced ability to resolve acute phase of Salmonella infection in the liver. Pretreatment with a low dose of anti-alpha beta TcR mAb (60 micrograms/mouse), which depleted only bright <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> TcR cells, did not affect the bacterial growth in the liver at the early stage after Salmonella infection, while the depleting of both intermediate and bright <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> TcR cells by pretreatment with a high dose of anti-alpha beta TcR mAb (120 micrograms/mouse) allowed the bacteria to multiply exaggeratedly in the liver at this stage. These results suggest that intermediate <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> TcR cells may {{play an important role in}} protection at the early stage after Salmonella infection in liver and that the interaction of ICAM- 1 /LFA- 1 is critically involved in protective roles of extrathymic T cells bearing intermediate <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> TcR in liver at the early stage after Salmonella infection...|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} of T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> {{was investigated in}} rat CD 4 - CD 8 - thymocytes during thymic reconstitution after the exposure of animals to irradiation or glucocorticoid. The effect of the immunosuppressant FK 506 on the {{expression of}} TCR <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> in rat CD 4 - CD 8 - thymocytes was also examined. The percentage of CD 4 - CD 8 - thymocytes constituted 2. 6 % of total thymocytes and that of CD 4 - CD 8 - TCR <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> high cells constituted 12. 6 % of CD 4 - CD 8 - thymocytes in normal adult Lewis rats. The percentage of CD 4 - CD 8 - TCR <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> high cells increased during thymic reconstitution after irradiation, and maximally constituted 28. 6 % of CD 4 - CD 8 - thymocytes on day 7. Similar results were obtained during thymic reconstitution after glucocorticoid treatment. In contrast, continuous treatment with FK 506 for 7 days markedly decreased not only the percentages of CD 4 + CD 8 - TCR <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> high and CD 4 - CD 8 + TCR <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> high thymocytes, but also that of CD 4 - CD 8 - TCR <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> high thymocytes. These results indicate that rat CD 4 - CD 8 - thymocytes contain a subpopulation of mature (TCR <b>alpha</b> <b>beta</b> high) cells.
