There are two broad carbon cycles on earth: the fast carbon cycle and the slow carbon cycle.

For many years the statues were {{thought to have been}} produced locally at the sites in which they were discovered, but recent scientific analysis (X-ray diffraction, sequential <b>acid</b> <b>dissolution,</b> and inductively coupled plasma analyses) has shown all of the statues to have been produced from a flint clay only found in the vicinity of St. Louis, Missouri. The particular pipestone used by the artists of Cahokia has a distinctive combination of a lithium bearing chlorite, abundant boehmite (an aluminium oxyhydroxide) and a heavy-metal phosphate mineral suite. It is believed that the objects were considered to be valuable trade and religious objects, and spread far and wide from their place of production in the American Bottom. Many of the figurines depict mythological characters from the Chiefly Warrior cult and the Earth/fertility cult.

40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} clays {{typically are}} mixtures of clay minerals and non-clay minerals, such as quartz, feldspar, carbonates, metal oxides and hydroxides. The use of particular clays often {{depends on their}} mineralogical composition, because the presence of some non-clay minerals may change few physicochemical properties and influence the purification of clay minerals. Carbonates and iron containing compounds behave as cementing agents, thereby inducing the aggregation of clay particles. Because of these aggregates the stability of clay suspensions decreases and the purification of raw clay samples from non-clay minerals is hindered. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the changes in the aggregation and size distribution of clay particles and the stability of clay-water suspensions after complete or partial removal of carbonates with different organic acids. The influence of acid treatment on the dissolution of iron containing compounds was also investigated. The clay samples were taken from deposits in Latvia, containing 13 - 15 % carbonates and illite as the main clay mineral.

50|$|X-ray equipment, like CAT scans, {{are used}} to study the {{interior}} of fossil eggs. Unlike CAT scans, x-ray imaging condenses the entire interior of the egg into a single two-dimensional image rather than a series of images documenting the interior in three dimensions. X-ray imaging {{in the context of}} dinosaur research has generally been used to look for evidence of embryonic fossils contained inside the egg. However, as of Kenneth Carpenter's 1999 book Eggs, Nests, and Baby Dinosaurs, all putative embryos discovered using x-rays have been misidentifications. This is because the use of x-rays to find embryos is conceptually flawed. Embryo bones are incompletely developed and will generally lack their own mineral content, as such the only source of minerals for these bones is the sediment that fills the egg after burial. The fossilized bones will therefore have the same density as the sediment filling the interior of the egg which served as the source for their mineral content and will be poorly visible in an x-ray image. So far the only reliable method for examining embryonic fossils preserved in dinosaur eggs is to physically extract them through means such as <b>acid</b> <b>dissolution.</b>|$|E

40|$|Iron (Fe) is an {{important}} micronutrient in soils, essential for bacterial growth and carbon metabolism, serving as an enzymatic cofactor for many central carbon metabolic reactions. It has limited bioavailability due to being embedded in Fe oxide and hydroxide minerals. Bacteria secrete high-affinity metal-binding molecules, or siderophores, along with low-affinity organic acids to cope with Fe limitation and facilitate mineral dissolution. In the research presented, I investigated the role of available carbon sources (glucose, succinate, acetate, and citrate) on the secretion of these molecules from the ubiquitous soil bacteria Pseudomonas putida and their effectiveness in dissolving Fe from common soil minerals. Fe limited cells secreted the siderophore pyoverdine in addition to secreting higher levels of small organic <b>acids.</b> <b>Dissolution</b> experiments were carried out with bacterial secretions, substrates, and detected organic acids to {{determine the amount of}} Fe released with each organic compound. Overall, bacterial secretions were more effective in dissolving Fe than the individual substrates and organic acids. Additionally, to elucidate the changes in metabolic flux with respect to Fe, kinetic and steadystate isotopic labeling experiments were performed with [U- 13 C] and [1, 2 - 13 C] glucose under Felimited and replete conditions. Steady-state experiments were also performed with [2, 3 - 13 C] succinate under Fe-replete conditions to compare changes in metabolic flux between carbon sources. Overall, most fluxes decreased under Fe-limited conditions with glucose as the sole carbon source, but the flux to the amino acid precursor phosphoenolpyruvate increased. The succinate flux model showed a decrease in flux through the citric acid cycle under Fe-replete conditions, with a corresponding decrease in the amount of CO 2 produced compared to Fereplete glucose.

The X-ray diffraction analyses showed that vermiculite and mixed-layer micavermiculite structures in the natural sample were completely destroyed following dissolution in 4 N H 2 SO 4, whereas the basal peak related to mica, which exist in minor amounts in the natural sample, was observed in the X-ray diffraction patterns even after the dissolution in 8 N H 2 SO 4.

The behavior of gaseous species and their chemical transformation in clouds are difficult to observe experimentally given the complex nature of clouds. During a winter field campaign at the summit of the Puy de Dôme (central France, 1465 m a. s. l), we have deployed an experimental set-up to provide a quantification of phase partitioning of both organic (CH 3 COOH, HCOOH, H 2 C 2 O 4) and inorganic (NH 3, HNO 3, SO 2, HCl) species in clouds. We found that nitric and hydrochloric acids can be considered close to Henry's law equilibrium, within analytical uncertainty and instrumental errors. On another hand, for NH 3 and carboxylic <b>acids,</b> <b>dissolution</b> of material from the gas phase is kinetically limited and never reaches the equilibrium predicted by thermodynamics, resulting in significant sub-saturation of the liquid phase.

Upon droplet evaporation, a significant part of most species, including S IV, tends to efficiently return back into the gas phase. Overall, gas contribution to the droplet solute concentration ranges from at least 48. 5 to 98 % depending on the chemical species.
