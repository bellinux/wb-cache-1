5|$|According to Transport for London (TfL), {{the station}} is at {{capacity}} {{because of the large}} number of passengers leaving and entering the station, as well as the large numbers of passengers changing between lines. Currently, everyone who uses the station has to pass through the intermediate concourse {{at the bottom of the}} main escalators. This causes congestion <b>and</b> <b>delays.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tremors were felt {{to varying}} degrees {{throughout}} New York State, including by people in some buildings in Manhattan.

Amtrak train service at Penn Station was also delayed.|$|E
30|$|However, the {{differences}} between <b>delayed</b> cosine <b>and</b> <b>delayed</b> sine <b>and</b> cosine and sine are that the <b>delayed</b> cosine <b>and</b> <b>delayed</b> sine appear in the interval segment [-τ, 0] and with the increasing of variables t, {{the upper and lower}} bounds of <b>delayed</b> cosine <b>and</b> <b>delayed</b> sine are also increasing. When the delay τ= 0, by (3) <b>and</b> (4), the <b>delayed</b> cosine <b>and</b> <b>delayed</b> sine coincide with the cosine and sine functions.|$|R
5000|$|Used {{most often}} {{to turn down}} the music when the DJ speaks, ducking may be used to combat the {{muffling}} and distancing effect of reverb <b>and</b> <b>delay.</b> The ducker is inserted into the reverb <b>and</b> <b>delay</b> line <b>and</b> keyed to a dry track to duck its own reverb <b>and</b> <b>delay</b> so that when the dry track exceeds the ducker's threshold by reaching a certain amplitude the reverb <b>and</b> <b>delay</b> are attenuated. Clear examples include Céline Dion's [...] "The Power Of Love" [...] where the reverb <b>and</b> <b>delay</b> become audible when Dion pauses and Adele's [...] "Cold Shoulder".|$|R
40|$|The two-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) {{interference}} channel (IC) with {{arbitrary number}} of antennas at each terminal is considered and the {{degrees of freedom}} (DoF) region is characterized {{in the presence of}} noiseless channel output feedback from each receiver to its respective transmitter <b>and</b> availability of <b>delayed</b> channel state information at the transmitters (CSIT). It is shown that having output feedback <b>and</b> <b>delayed</b> CSIT can strictly enlarge the DoF region of the MIMO IC when compared to the case in which only delayed CSIT is present. The proposed coding schemes that achieve the corresponding DoF region with feedback <b>and</b> <b>delayed</b> CSIT utilize both resources, i. e., feedback <b>and</b> <b>delayed</b> CSIT in a non-trivial manner. It is also shown that the DoF region with local feedback <b>and</b> <b>delayed</b> CSIT is equal to the DoF region with global feedback <b>and</b> <b>delayed</b> CSIT, i. e., local feedback <b>and</b> <b>delayed</b> CSIT is equivalent to global feedback <b>and</b> <b>delayed</b> CSIT {{from the perspective of the}} degrees of freedom region. The converse is proved for a stronger setting in which the channels to the two receivers need not be statistically equivalent.

5|$|U-20 {{was one of}} two boats of {{the class}} to be built at the Pola Navy Yard. Due to demands by the Hungarian government, {{subcontracts}} for the class were divided between Hungarian and Austrian firms, but this politically expedient solution worsened technical problems with the design and resulted in numerous modifications <b>and</b> <b>delays</b> for the class in general.|$|E
5|$|Before {{construction}} could begin, the Navy {{found itself}} {{in the midst of}} political situation because the Hungarian government demanded that {{a substantial portion of the}} submarine contracts be allocated to Hungarian firms. After intricate negotiations, the order was split into two orders of two submarines each, with U-20 and U-21 built at the Pola Navy Yard, and U-22 and U-23 built at the Hungarian UBAG yard at Fiume. The subcontracts were also divided between Hungarian and Austrian firms, with about two-thirds going to Hungarian companies and one-third to Austrian companies. This allocation of contracts, while politically expedient, exacerbated technical problems that resulted in numerous modifications <b>and</b> <b>delays.</b>|$|E
5|$|By the 1970s and 1980s, the New York City Subway was at {{an all-time}} low. Ridership had dropped to 1910s levels, and {{graffiti}} and crime were rampant on the subway; in general, the subway was very poorly maintained during that time, <b>and</b> <b>delays</b> and track problems were common. Still, the NYCTA managed to open six new subway stations in the 1980s, make the current fleet of subway cars graffiti-free, as well as order 1,775 new subway cars. By the early 1990s, conditions had improved significantly, although maintenance backlogs accumulated during those 20 years are still being fixed today.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{design of}} packet schedulers {{involves}} a tradeoff between implementation complexity, on one hand, <b>and</b> <b>delay</b> <b>and</b> fairness guarantees, on the other. In this paper, we present worst-case fair bin sort queuing (WBSQ), a new scheduler that has good worst-case fairness <b>and</b> <b>delay</b> properties, yet has low complexity and is amenable to simple hardware implementation. WBSQ achieves this performance by combining features of BSFQ and WF 2 Q+. We establish the worst-case fairness <b>and</b> <b>delay</b> properties of WBSQ through both analysis and simulation.

5|$|Cordon area {{congestion}} pricing is a fee or tax paid by users {{to enter a}} restricted area, usually within a city center, {{as part of a}} demand management strategy to relieve traffic congestion within that area. The economic rationale for this pricing scheme is based on the externalities or social costs of road transport, such as air pollution, noise, traffic accidents, environmental and urban deterioration, and the extra costs <b>and</b> <b>delays</b> imposed by traffic congestion upon other drivers when additional users enter a congested road.|$|E
5|$|Despite precautions, the {{post-production}} faced significant delays {{owing to}} the digital inter-mediation, increased work-load due to the 3-D and dubbed versions of the film, <b>and</b> <b>delays</b> in {{the completion of the}} visual effects. The post-production also faced budget constraints and witnessed an overuse of CGI according to the cinematographer. The delays left only two days for printing the film and sending it to theatres, generating significant anxiety over a possible delay in the release. Khan subsequently kept strict tabs on the progress of work, and postponed his knee surgery to complete the film on time.|$|E

By June 2010, the project's cost had risen to £600 million. Council project managers were reported to be in crisis talks, considering options including: borrowing £55 million to fund the increased costs; phasing {{the introduction of the}} tram line, so that trams would initially run between the airport and Haymarket; and terminating the contract with Bilfinger Berger. The council asked TIE to draw up costs for truncating the line at four places: Haymarket station, York Place, the foot of Leith Walk or Ocean Terminal.|$|E
5|$|From a {{military}} point of view, the outcome at Vukovar {{was not a}} disaster for Croatia's overall war effort. The battle broke {{the back of the}} JNA offensive and left Croatia's main adversary exhausted and unable to press its offensive deeper into the country. Vukovar was probably indefensible, being almost surrounded by Serb-held territory and closer to Belgrade than to Zagreb, and although the defeat was damaging to morale, in a strategic context the damage <b>and</b> <b>delays</b> inflicted on the JNA more than made up for the loss of the town.|$|E
5|$|Further {{investments}} beyond {{construction of}} the new terminal were planned since 2007 for bulk cargo terminal equipment worth €80M, cargo terminal equipment worth €11million, replacement of equipment in pre-2007 port facilities valued at €26million and re{{construction of the}} liquid cargo terminal worth €70million. These investments were originally scheduled for 20072014, but the pace of development is slower than expected, <b>and</b> <b>delays</b> of a year to two had been observed by 2010. The required superstructure is planned to be funded through build-operate-transfer contracts and public–private partnerships. The investments made since 2007 and those planned as of 2011 are aimed at increasing the port's throughput from 8 to 10million tonnes of cargo per year.|$|E

5|$|In April 2011, {{after many}} years of {{proposals}} <b>and</b> <b>delays,</b> construction began on a major upgrade of the Henlys Corner interchange. An underpass was originally proposed but this was heavily criticised by local residents, and would have been very costly, and was subsequently scrapped. The upgrade scheme improved on the current junction by adding extra lanes and allowing easier left and right turns, speeding up queue times. Cycle paths and safer pedestrian crossings were included.|$|E
