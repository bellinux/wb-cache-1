5|$|His vocal {{style has}} varied from <b>a</b> <b>screaming,</b> yowling {{delivery}} as lead vocalist of the Pixies {{to a more}} measured and melodic style in his solo career. His cryptic lyrics mostly explore unconventional subjects, such as surrealism, incest and biblical violence, along with science fiction and surf culture. His use of atypical meter signatures, loud–quiet dynamics and distinct preference for live-to-two-track recording in {{his career as a}} solo artist give him a distinct style within alternative rock.|$|E
5|$|After {{signing a}} three-year contract, worth $850,000 per {{year with the}} Canucks on May 4, 2006, Bourdon earned {{a spot on the}} team's 2006–07 opening roster. He played his first NHL game on October 10, 2006 against the Minnesota Wild, but after playing nine games and scoring no points, he was sent again to the QMJHL for further development. On January 8, 2007, Bourdon was again traded in the QMJHL, with Moncton sending him to the Cape Breton Screaming Eagles in {{exchange}} for Mark Barberio and a first round selection in the 2007 QMJHL draft. As <b>a</b> <b>Screaming</b> Eagle, Bourdon lost in the QMJHL semi-final against his former team, Val-d'Or. He finished the 2006–07 QMJHL season with 20 points in 36 games. When the Canucks did not qualify for the playoffs, they sent Bourdon to play five games for the Manitoba Moose, who {{were in the middle of}} the AHL playoffs. He was held pointless through five AHL playoff games. Including his participation in the 2007 World Junior Championships, Bourdon played for five different teams throughout the 2006–07 season.|$|E

Cimino was new to his post and intervened in a match finish involving Sammartino, who took a shot at Cimino in the ring and the argument continued backstage.

25|$|With {{the speedy}} Mays on second, any base {{hit by the}} next batter, Willie McCovey, would likely win the series for the Giants. McCovey hit <b>a</b> <b>screaming</b> line drive right at second baseman Bobby Richardson, who snared it after a step or two, {{bringing}} the Series to a sudden end. Earlier in the inning, a failed sacrifice bunt by Felipe Alou with nobody out had ultimately kept his brother Matty, who couldn't advance to second, from scoring on Mays' two-out double. Finally, Richardson was not originally positioned to catch the drive until he moved three steps to his left in reaction to a McCovey's foul smash on the preceding pitch.|$|E

The Ghostface persona remains the same throughout the Scream series, featuring a black hood and cloak with a jagged base and a white rubber-mask resembling a ghost with <b>a</b> <b>screaming</b> expression. Though each iteration of Ghostface is human, they often exhibit extreme durability against physical harm, high levels of physical strength, and an almost supernatural stealth ability; able to appear and disappear in seemingly impossible situations. The character has often appeared in popular culture since its inception, referenced in film and television as well as spawning a series of action figures and merchandise.|$|E

Chester later dumps and then fires Claire to support Jessica during the trial, which sends Claire into <b>a</b> <b>screaming</b> rage in the restaurant, trashing their meal in the process.

25|$|Tyrone Dobbs {{was also}} the centre of a {{domestic}} abuse storyline when he was introduced to police officer Kirsty Soames whilst on a night out. Tyrone and Kirsty immediately hit it off. Kirsty's temper began to show when she used to become jealous of Tyrone's friends, specifically his friendship with Fiz Stape. Kirsty fell pregnant and her temper soon turned violent as she lashed out at Tyrone on numerous occasions, attacking him with her fists and kitchen appliances. Tyrone hid his injuries from his concerned friends and refused to leave the house. Kirsty gave birth in the Rovers Return after a heated confrontation with Tina, yet Tyrone was absent due to him fixing Fiz's boiler. This made Kirsty secretly leave out Tyrone's name as their newborn daughter Ruby's father on the birth certificate. Kirsty's violent outbursts become more frequent and a terrified Tyrone finally confides in a horrified Fiz about Kirsty's domestic abuse, this leads to Tyrone and Fiz embarking on a secret affair after she confesses her love for him. Fiz and Tyrone conspire a plan together for Tyrone to wed Kirsty then report Kirsty to the police for her domestic abuse, resulting in Kirsty being sent to prison and Tyrone getting full custody of his daughter Ruby. Tyrone proposes to a delighted Kirsty, but Kirsty eventually discovers his affair with Fiz, and their plan. Kirsty eventually reveals Fiz and Tyrone's affair {{in front of everybody}} at her and Tyrone's wedding. After the wedding, Kirsty and Tyrone have a blazing row back at their house, resulting in Kirsty falling down the stairs after trying to attack Tyrone. The row is overheard by several neighbours and they think Tyrone has been assaulting Kirsty and call the police. Kirsty lies to the police and makes a false accusation that Tyrone has been beating her for months. This leads to Tyrone's arrest and he is bailed until his appending trial. Whilst on bail, Tyrone flees Weatherfield with Fiz, her daughter Hope and his daughter Ruby causing the police to issue a warrant for his arrest. Tyrone is caught and arrested. Kirsty lies again whilst giving evidence at Tyrone's trial by playing the victim to the jury. But whilst struggling being a single mum at home, Kirsty snaps at <b>a</b> <b>screaming</b> Ruby and starts screaming at her child to stop crying. Realising that she does not trust herself around her daughter, Kirsty interrupts Tyrone's trial and confesses to the judge that it was her who had been assaulting Tyrone and he was innocent. Tyrone gets released and Kirsty gets charged and is sentenced to three years in prison. Tyrone gets full custody of Ruby and starts his new life with his girlfriend Fiz.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Rose became a staunch believer in homeopathic medicine, and began {{regularly}} undergoing past life regression therapy.

[...] His dislike of touring was caused in part by the various illnesses he contracted over time.

[...] Warren, who regrets {{the decision to}} publicise the film in such a graphic manner, comments, [...] "The problem with mail-drops {{is that you have}} no way of knowing who lives in the house, or who will see it first.

500|$|Hemingway {{learned from}} Ezra Pound {{how to achieve}} a stripped-down style and how to {{incorporate}} the concepts of imagism in his prose. He said Pound [...] "had taught him more 'about how to write and how not to write' than any {{son of a bitch}} alive"; and his friend James Joyce told him [...] "to pare down his work to the essentials". The prose is spare and lacks a clear symbolism. Instead of more conventional literary allusions, Hemingway relied on repetitive metaphors or metonymy to build images. The caesarian is repeatedly associated with words such as [...] "the blanket" [...] and [...] "the bunk" [...] in a series of objective correlatives, a technique Hemingway learned from T.S. Eliot. Tetlow believes in this early story Hemingway ignored character development; he simply places a character in a setting, and adds descriptive detail such as <b>a</b> <b>screaming</b> woman, men smoking tobacco, and an infected wound, which give a sense of truth.|$|E
500|$|Wesley Yin-Poole of VideoGamer.com {{said that}} despite the {{controversy}} the game was attracting due to alleged racism, no expert opinion had been sought. He asked Glenn Bowman, senior lecturer in social anthropology at the University of Kent, whether he thought the game was racist. Bowman considered the racism accusations [...] "silly", saying that the game had an anti-colonial theme and those complaining about the game's racism might be expressing an [...] "inverted racism which says that you can't have scary people who are black." [...] It was reported that one cutscene in the game scene showed [...] "black men" [...] dragging off <b>a</b> <b>screaming</b> white woman; according to Yin-Poole, the allegation was incorrect and the single man dragging the woman was [...] "not obviously black". The scene was submitted to the British Board of Film Classification for evaluation. BBFC head of communications Sue Clark said, [...] "There is only one man pulling the blonde woman in from the balcony [...] is not black either. As the whole game is set in Africa {{it is hardly surprising}} that some of the characters are black ... we do take racism very seriously, but in this case there is no issue around racism." ...|$|E

500|$|The way Ned Flanders {{prepares the}} cocktails {{at the party}} is similar to actor Tom Cruise's bartending stunts in the 1988 film Cocktail. Songs heard at the party include Tom Jones's [...] "It's Not Unusual" [...] (1965), Dusty Springfield's [...] "The Look of Love" [...] (1967), KC and the Sunshine Band's [...] "That's the Way (I Like It)" [...] (1975), and Glen Campbell's [...] "Wichita Lineman" [...] (1968). Homer's false memory of the party the {{following}} day (in which he imagines himself as being erudite and witty instead of drunk) is {{a reference to the}} Algonquin Round Table, a group of New York City writers, critics, actors, and wits. The [...] "Mexican Hat Dance" [...] song is heard when Marge turns on the radio in the car to mute the conversation between her and Homer so that the children cannot hear them fight. When Homer comes into the church late, while looking for his chair, a character who strikes a resemblance to Adolf Hitler is seen. In a flashback sequence, Bart remembers chasing away <b>a</b> <b>screaming</b> babysitter with the car as a toddler. This sequence and the music in it are references to a scene in the 1976 film The Omen, in which the Devil's child Damien makes animals shriek in terror as Damien approaches. The picture of General Sherman at the bait shop is a reference to the [...] of the Loch Ness Monster. John and Gloria are a reference to George and Martha from Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Homer's attempt at catching General Sherman, his bludgeoning of the fish and the line [...] "I love you but I have to kill you" [...] are all based on Santiago's fight with the marlin in Ernest Hemingway's novel The Old Man and the Sea. The battle between Homer and General Sherman is also reminiscent of Captain Ahab's battle with the white whale Moby-Dick in the novel Moby-Dick.|$|E
