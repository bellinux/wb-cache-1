5|$|When {{he learned}} of the complaint, Arafiles spoke with the sheriff of Winkler County, who was his friend {{and one of his}} patients. Arafiles alleged that the nurses' reports to the medical board {{constituted}} harassment.

Galle <b>and</b> <b>Mitchell</b> were terminated from the hospital and faced criminal charges of misuse of official information. Galle's charges were dropped before trial <b>and</b> <b>Mitchell</b> was acquitted by a jury. In the aftermath of Mitchell's trial, Arafiles, several county officials and a hospital administrator all faced jail time for their roles in the retaliation against the nurses.|$|E

5|$|Sheila is {{kidnapped by}} Steiner, who interrogates {{her in her}} {{apartment}}. She reveals that Blanchard and Latham planned against him, angering Steiner.

Meanwhile, Davis has examined Latham's body and realizes that the electric marks left on Latham {{were the same as}} the criminals. Steiner shows up at Hill's house, where he finds her <b>and</b> <b>Mitchell.</b> Steiner demands that they tell him where he can find more electricity, since after the projection he needs energy to survive.
