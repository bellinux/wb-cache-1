5|$|For acute {{cases in}} the leg, the ACCP {{recommended}} a parenteral anticoagulant (such as LMWH, fondaparinux, or unfractionated heparin) {{for at least five}} days and a VKA, the oral anticoagulant, the same day. LMWH and fondaparinux are suggested over unfractionated heparin, but both are retained in those with compromised kidney function, unlike unfractionated heparin. The VKA is generally taken for a minimum of three months to maintain an international normalized ratio of 2.0–3.0, with 2.5 as the target. The benefit of taking a VKA declines as the duration of treatment extends, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of bleeding increases with age.|$|E
5|$|Genetics {{may play}} a role in a person's {{disposition}} to SAH; risk is increased three- to fivefold in first-degree relatives of people having had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, lifestyle factors are more important in determining overall risk. These risk factors are smoking, hypertension (high blood pressure), and excessive alcohol consumption. Having smoked in the past confers a doubled risk of SAH compared to those who have never smoked. Some protection of uncertain significance is conferred by caucasian ethnicity, hormone replacement therapy, and diabetes mellitus. There is likely an inverse relationship between total serum cholesterol <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of non-traumatic SAH, though confirmation of this association is hindered by a lack of studies. Approximately 4 percent of aneurysmal bleeds occur after sexual intercourse and 10 percent of people with SAH are bending over or lifting heavy objects at the onset of their symptoms.|$|E
5|$|If {{the patient}} {{presents}} {{less than eight}} hours after paracetamol overdose, then acetylcysteine significantly {{reduces the risk of}} serious hepatotoxicity and guarantees survival. If acetylcysteine is started more than 8hours after ingestion, there is a sharp decline in its effectiveness because the cascade of toxic events in the liver has already begun, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of acute liver necrosis and death increases dramatically. Although acetylcysteine is most effective if given early, it still has beneficial effects if given as late as 48hours after ingestion. In clinical practice, if the patient presents more than eight hours after the paracetamol overdose, then activated charcoal is not useful, and acetylcysteine is started immediately. In earlier presentations, charcoal can be given when the patient arrives and acetylcysteine is initiated while waiting for the paracetamol level results to return from the laboratory.|$|E

5|$|In humans, plasma {{triglycerides}} such as triacylglycerols {{have been}} long debated {{as an important}} risk factor for not only cardiovascular disease but also for other relevant morbidities, such as cancer, renal disease, suicide, and all-cause mortality. The APOA5 gene was found by comparative sequencing of ~200 kbp of human and mice DNA as the last member of the gene cluster of apolipoproteins located on human chromosome 11 at 11q23. Two mouse transgenic mouse models (APOA5 transgenic and APOA5 knockout) confirmed {{the important role of}} this gene in plasma triglyceride levels of plasma triglycerides. Obesity and metabolic syndrome are both closely related to plasma triglyceride levels and APOA5. Recent meta-analyses suggest that the effect on metabolic syndrome development is more profound for rs662799 in Asian population and for rs3135506 for Europeans. Moreover, meta-analysis that focused on rs662799 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of type 2 diabetes mellitus has suggested a significant association in Asian populations, but not in European populations.|$|E
5|$|Territorial {{males are}} very site-faithful; 90% {{return to the}} same lekking sites in {{subsequent}} seasons, the most dominant males being {{the most likely to}} reappear. Site-faithful males can acquire accurate information about the competitive abilities of other males, leading to well-developed dominance relationships. Such stable relationships reduce conflict <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of injury, and the consequent lower levels of male aggression are less likely to scare off females. Lower-ranked territorial males also benefit from site fidelity since they can remain on the leks while waiting for the top males eventually to drop out.|$|E

5|$|The most {{frequent}} complication of proximal DVT is post-thrombotic syndrome, {{which is caused}} by a reduction in the return of venous blood to the heart. Some symptoms of post-thrombotic syndrome are pain, edema, paresthesia, and in severe cases, leg ulcers. An estimated 20–50% of those with DVT will develop it, and 5–10% will develop the severe form. PE is the most serious complication of proximal DVT, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of PE is higher when clots are present in the thigh and pelvis. Distal DVT itself is hardly if ever associated with post-thrombotic syndrome or PE. Untreated lower extremity DVT has a 3% PE-related mortality rate, while deaths associated with upper extremity DVT are extremely rare. The presence of a remaining thrombus after a DVT frequently occurs in a minority of people, and it increases the risk of recurrence, though to a lesser extent than an elevated D-dimer. In the 10 years following a DVT, approximately a third of individuals will have a recurrent episode.|$|E
5|$|The {{second most}} {{frequent}} mode of HIV transmission is via blood and blood products. Blood-borne transmission can be through needle-sharing during intravenous drug use, needle stick injury, transfusion of contaminated blood or blood product, or medical injections with unsterilized equipment. The risk from sharing a needle during drug injection is between 0.63 and 2.4% per act, {{with an average}} of 0.8%. The risk of acquiring HIV from a needle stick from an HIV-infected person is estimated as 0.3% (about 1 in 333) per act <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> following mucous membrane exposure to infected blood as 0.09% (about 1 in 1000) per act.

5|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} are {{the most}} important adverse effect of bupropion. A high incidence of seizures was responsible for the temporary withdrawal of the drug from the market between 1986 and 1989. The risk of seizure is strongly dose-dependent, but also dependent on the preparation. The sustained-release preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0.1% at daily dosages of less than 300mg of bupropion and 0.4% at 300–400mg. The immediate release preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0.4% for dosages below 450mg; the incidence climbs to 5% for dosages between 450–600mg per day. For comparison, the incidence of unprovoked seizure in the general population is 0.07 to 0.09%, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of seizure for a variety of other antidepressants is generally between 0.1 and 1.5% at recommended dosage levels. Clinical depression itself has been reported to increase the occurrence of seizures, and a study examining FDA clinical trial data has suggested that in most cases, low to moderate doses of antidepressants may not actually increase seizure risk at all. However, this study also found that bupropion and clomipramine were unique among antidepressants in that they were associated with increased incidence of seizures.|$|E
