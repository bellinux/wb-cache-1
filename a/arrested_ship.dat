40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{introduce}} one of the international <b>ship</b> <b>arrest</b> problems, <b>ship</b> <b>arrest</b> trends and compare these trends with the current <b>ship</b> <b>arrest</b> regime in Lithuania. The research shows that the present international regime is suitable for the current fast-changing society and a new convention should be drafted. The modern view of a <b>ship</b> <b>arrest</b> regime seems to be arrest-friendly since more and more various jurisdictions introduce presumptions or abolish strict requirements to make it easier for the creditor to arrest the vessel. The conclusion is that some changes should be made in Lithuania by introducing separate <b>ship</b> <b>arrest</b> rules in the Civil Procedure Code, which will eliminate uncommon and unnecessary restraints. The article will be useful to anyone interested in maritime law, i. e. lawyers, judges and law students...|$|R

The basic approach to the principle of temporary <b>arrest</b> of <b>ships</b> remained unchanged according to the Convention of 1999 compared to the 1952 Convention. Still, temporary <b>arrest</b> of <b>ships</b> can only be effected for maritime claims. Having in mind that the 1999 Convention increases the number of maritime claims in relation to the Convention of 1952, and in a way that certain maritime claims that were previously considered claims for purely business relationship, for which creditors {{had not been able to}} enjoy the protection relating to <b>arrest</b> of the <b>ship,</b> are deemed to be maritime claims. Changes were also made to the right of re-arrest and multiple <b>arrest</b> of the <b>ship.</b> Convention of 1999 does not greatly alter the existing international regulations as established by the previous Convention, but attempts to additionally specify certain solutions contained in both the Conventions, in terms of their improvement and modernization...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{overview}} of specific possibilities to secure a maritime claim available to claimants {{from all over the}} world, based on the legal regimes of <b>arrest</b> of <b>ships</b> in Norway and Ukraine, as well as on Rule B attachment is given. Due to the fact, that International Convention Relating to the <b>Arrest</b> of Sea-Going <b>Ships</b> (Brussels, May 10, 1952) was ratified by Norway, and not ratified by Ukraine, such analysis, I hope, will give to the reader {{an overview of}} possible complications, which can arise, when <b>arrest</b> of a <b>ship</b> is sought in a country party to Brussels convention and in a country, which is not. With respect to Norway specific attention will be paid to the issues of <b>arrest</b> of a <b>ship,</b> not owned by a debtor, {{as well as to the}} specific requirements of “arrest ground”. Regarding Ukraine, which has very unclear rules regarding <b>arrest</b> of <b>ships,</b> I intend to focus on specific problems, which the claimant can face and come with specific proposals regarding amendments to Ukrainian legislation in order to bring arrest rules in compliance with internationally recognized practice. Moreover, a brief legal analysis of Rule B attachment of EFTs will be made with a view to its advantages and disadvantages comparing to <b>ship</b> <b>arrest,</b> in order to provide the reader with a broader view on specific remedies, which are used to secure maritime claims nowadays...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of <b>ship</b> <b>arrest</b> law in the West and the East, namely the US and the People’s Republic of China (PRC), {{understanding}} the different approaches adopted in these countries’ maritime courts would be a topic of interest to both comparative lawyers and international traders. The tremendous volume of shipping activities {{taking place in the}} US and China makes the two countries popular forums for <b>ship</b> <b>arrest</b> proceedings. In the US, maritime imports accounted for 42 percent of all imports in 2004. In China, the container volume exported is expected to reach 100 million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) by 2010. This article argues that a through comparative longitudinal study of these countries’ court practices concerning <b>ship</b> <b>arrest,</b> {{it may be possible to}} uncover any consistent approaches taken by the maritime courts. The aim of this article is twofold: (I) to provide an overview of the developments in <b>ship</b> <b>arrest</b> law in today’s US and China, and (ii) to contribute to the comparative study of the different approaches adopted in Chinese and US <b>ship</b> <b>arrest</b> laws by filling a gap in the existing literature in this area. The last section of the article is devoted to a review of the 2003 New Practice Direction, issued by the Supreme People’s Court, on Chinese maritime procedural law. As there are ten maritime courts in China, different interpretations of the ambiguous maritime statutes are inevitable. The discussion will focus on those approaches to <b>ship</b> <b>arrest</b> laws that were reviewed in the 2003 New Practice Direction. This article is designed to provide helpful information to European legal professionals who are new to <b>ship</b> <b>arrest</b> law practices in the Chinese maritime courts as well as to more experienced practitioners who may need to enforce a <b>ship</b> <b>arrest</b> order in the PRC’s jurisdiction.

In respect of that, <b>ship</b> <b>arrest</b> has been introduced in Indonesia through the Law number 17 Year 2008 “Shipping Law”.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this thesis is to discuss in detail privileged marithne claims, Maritime Liensfocusing on their {{existence}} in Enghsh Law, {{and deal with the}} aspects of their enforcement, whilst also considering the problems which can -and in practice usually do- arise while the entitied claimants attempt to enforce their Maritime Liens. The points covered by this thesis include the principle of Maritime Liens as recognised under English Law, and the way that these can be enforced against the offending maritime property in order to satisfy the existing claims. Also, discussed are the-various problems with which maritime lienholders aire often faced, such as the conflict'of laws existing between the numerous maritime nations-as well as the various Conventions that have been createdin order to eliminate the existing problems relating to Maritime lines arid the <b>Arrest</b> of <b>Ships!.</b> Additionally, a brief discussion about the need for the creation of uniform rules regarding Maritime Liens wiU be made, followed by an outline of the practice of forum shopping. To give a more specific preview of this thesis, the stmcture of the chapters presented is this: In the first -introductory- chapter Maritime Liens are defined and historically reviewed; the concept of Maritime Liens is closely examined by discussing their fundamental characteristics and properties, and, finally, their worth as a privileged maritime claim is evaluated. At the same time, a brief introduction to the problems that claimants may face while trying to enforce them, as weU as the attempts that have been made to unify the Intemational law regarding Maritime Liens, is given. The second chapter deals with Maritime Liens recognised in English Law, discussing those claims which give the claimant the right to proceed in rem against maritime property. In the third chapter, the enforcement of Maritime Liens is discussed. The whole procedure of enforcing a claim is dealt with in detail, startmg from the action in rem, and its nature, to the <b>arrest</b> of <b>ships.</b> The right to <b>arrest</b> a sister <b>ship</b> is also considered as well as the issue of <b>arresting</b> a <b>ship</b> chartered by demise charterers. The actual procedure of arrest is also mentioned, including the practicalities of arrest; further, the difficulties that claimants encounter in enforcing Maritime Liens are discussed -such as the extinction of Maritime Liens, the provisions of the 1976 Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims and the Caveat Against Arrest. The fourth chapter introduces the issue of the conflict of laws relating to Maritime Liens; it concentrates into the numerous forms the problem can take, extensively discussing the matter of priority of Maritime Liens. The priority given under the English, American and the 1926 Maritime Liens and Mortgages Convention are briefly mentioned. Finally, the attempts that have so far been, made to settie and unify the existing Maritime Liens conflicts are reviewed, considering the various Conventions relating to both Maritime Liens and Mortgages and the <b>Arrest</b> of <b>ships.</b> In the fifth Chapter, aspects such as the uniformity that could be achieved through the ratification of international conventions and the practice of forum shopping are dealt with. Finally, in the sbcth Chapter, a brief summary of the project and its scope is made and conclusions are drawn...|$|R
