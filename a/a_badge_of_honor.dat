25|$|Most Japanese {{people and}} {{agencies}} have adopted customs {{to deal with}} these issues. Address books, for instance, often contain furigana or ruby characters to clarify the pronunciation of the name. Japanese nationals are also required to give a romanized name for their passport. The recent use of katakana in Japanese media when referring to Japanese celebrities who have gained international fame has started a fad among young socialites who attempt to invoke a cosmopolitan flair using katakana names as <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor.</b> All of these complications are also found in Japanese place names.|$|E
25|$|Dodd {{was given}} several awards in {{recognition}} of {{his work at the}} Nuremberg trials.

Dodd also received the Czechoslovak Order of the White Lion. In 1949, the Polish government had intended to award Dodd with <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor</b> called the Officer's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta, but Dodd rejected the medal due to his commitment to human rights and views that the Polish government was imposing a tyranny similar to that imposed by the Nazis, and accepting an honor from the President of Poland would be like accepting one from the Nazis.|$|E

500|$|There was a noted {{effort on}} the part of Corps staff and other Transylvanian exiles (Ion Agârbiceanu, Laurian Gabor, Octavian Tăslăuanu etc.) to {{encourage}} the rapid integration of Podil-formed units into the Romanian line of defense. After a quick session of retraining, the Corps units were attached to the 11th Division, which was recovering in Iași. It was, however, decided that the formations, particularly those from Transylvania, were to be kept distinguished from the rest under the common command structure. An official act of 1918 explained the rationale behind this act: [...] "Transylvanians should fight as Transylvanians [...] against the Hungarian state, so as to assert, clearly and beyond all doubt, that the Romanian nationals of the Hungarian state do not recognize its authority. To have fought against Hungary, however the war may end, ought to have been <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor</b> for the Romanian nation in Hungary and a moral reinforcement during the battles to come". When it was proposed that men from the Corps be assigned noms de guerre so as to avoid execution if captured, Deleu reacted strongly: [...] "We intend to be the army of Transylvania! We aim to be the conscience of Transylvania, which is for absolute freedom and The Union! We do not want [...] a conquered land, we wish to liberate ourselves with our own forces! Hangings? Let them hang us! But let them be aware that Transylvania herself is fighting for liberty and The Union!" ...|$|E
500|$|As in {{the case}} of the first Mortal Kombat game, the content of Mortal Kombat II became the subject of a great deal of {{controversy}} regarding violent video games. Nancian Cherry of Toledo Blade wrote that both games had [...] "an army of critics too: people upset by the bone-crunching, blood-spurting, limb-ripping violence depicted on the small screen." [...] According to IGN, [...] "Mortal Kombat II wore its notoriety as <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor,</b> boasting about it in promotional materials, and even parodying it in-game." [...] The game was banned in Germany, where MKII was put in the index by the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons (BPjM) and all versions of the game except for the Game Boy version were subjected to being confiscated from the nation's market for violating the German Penal Code by showing excessive violence and cruel acts against representations of human beings. Due to regional censorship, the game was also released with green-colored blood and black-and-white fatality sequences in Japan; it was at that time a unique occurrence of a western game being censored in Japan, not the reverse. Years later, Boon recalled: [...] "I've always had the position that the rating system was a good idea and should be put in place. Once Mortal Kombat II came out, there was a rating system in place. We were an M-rated game, and everybody knew the content that was in there, so it became almost a non-issue." [...] Tobias agreed, saying that they [...] "were content with the M for mature on our packaging." ...|$|E

During the operation, her air group, led by V.G. Semkin, reportedly distinguished itself. On 25 July, the ship was given a commemorative Red Banner by the Executive Committee of the City Committee of the Communist Party of Sochi.

2500|$|... "Shine", {{written in}} 1910 by Cecil Mack (R.C.

5000|$|Boatswain's mates also stand {{watch on}} ship's bridges, passing {{information}} relating to routine and special activities to the crew with the distinctive boatswain's call or boatswain's pipe. On the ancient row-galleys, the boatswain used his pipe to [...] "call the stroke". Later, because its shrill tune could be heard above most of the activity on board, {{it was used to}} signal various happenings such as pipe down, and the Side or Away Galley (the boarding or debarking of officials). So essential was this signaling device to the well-being of the ship, that it became <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> office and <b>honor</b> in the British and American Navies.|$|R
40|$|T. S. Eliot (1963 : 112), who famously {{declared}} in 1921 that "poets in our civilization, {{as it exists}} at present, must be difficult," made difficulty <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> modernist <b>honor.</b> The attitudes <b>of</b> academic criticism since then might be categorized according to their degree of acceptance or rejection of this premise. New Criticism, by and large, made a virtue of difficulty, measuring poetic achievement {{in terms of the}} poet's management of tension and paradox. Conversely, recent criticism has often looked askance at difficulty, suspecting that it may be a form of mystificatory elitism or an instance of dishonestly evasive impersonality. However one chooses to view the matter theoretically, difficulty is an inescapable dimension of modernist texts, especially those that exemplify high-modernist experimentation [...] Eliot's The Waste Land, Pound's Cantos, Joyce's Ulysses, Barnes's Nightwood, Stein's Tender Buttons, Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury, Toomer's Cane, Dos Passos's U. S. A. trilogy [...] in short, many of the most frequently taught works in the curriculum of twentieth-century literature. This essay proposes that hypertext is a practical, though partial, solution to the nearly insuperable problems associated with reading and teaching the difficult modernist text. Because my students and I have created and studied with a hypertext of Pound's Canto 81, my examples are drawn primarily from that poem. The hypertextual version of this Canto provides access not only to the poem's "information" but to Pound's working methods, his aims in writing this "poem including history," and his presentation of the poem as covert and overt pedagogy...|$|R
5000|$|The Everleigh sisters spared {{no expense}} in their redecoration of their brothel which they named the Everleigh Club. A dozen parlors were {{located on the}} first floor. Each parlor {{consisted}} of a certain theme such as : the Silver Parlor, the Gold Parlor, the Rose Parlor, or the Japanese Throne Room—all of which appealed to the varying groups of clientele the club received. The upstairs of the Everleigh Club held the private bedrooms where clientele could enjoy a more personal encounter with the women of his choosing alongside luxurious divans, damask chairs, gilt bathtubs and warbling canaries. As luxurious, the dining room's design emulated a private Pullman railroad passenger car with the corresponding ornate gold and mahogany trimmings. The menu featured only the finest entrees such as: duck, caviar, lobster, deviled crab, fried oysters, goose capton, and an excellent selection of wine. It is due to all these extravagant amenities the Everleigh Club was dubbed [...] "probably the most famous and luxurious house of prostitution in the country" [...] by the Chicago Vice Commission. The Everleigh quickly gained a reputation as an upscale gentlemen's club, {{so much so that}} the Everleigh sisters were forced to turn away prospective clients even on opening day on February 1, 1900. The club's extensive popularity afforded Minna and Ada the opportunity to select their clientele. Only those men deemed suitable by Minna and Ada gained admittance into the Everleigh Club. The Everleigh sisters deemed a prospective client [...] "worthy" [...] to be admitted into the club if: the prospective client provided a letter of recommendation from an existing member, an engraved card, or through a formal introduction by Minna or Ada. These standards made the club extremely exclusive, indulging the desires of only the wealthy and influential men. Author Karen Abbott wrote, [...] "The cachet of being able to go there, just because they turned down so many people. It became <b>an</b> exclusive <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor</b> just to be admitted." ...|$|R

Williams added that Helms would [...] "wear this conviction like <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor,</b> like a banner", a sentiment later seconded by James R. Schlesinger, who had followed Helms as DCI in 1973. After his court appearance and sentencing, Helms attended a large gathering of CIA officers in Bethesda, Maryland, where he received a standing ovation. A collection was taken, netting enough to pay his fine.|$|E
2500|$|During {{a spring}} {{training}} {{game against the}} Chicago White Sox in 1963, the Reds' regular second baseman, Don Blasingame, pulled a groin muscle; Rose got his chance and {{made the most of}} it.

Despite (or perhaps because of) the manner in which Ford intended it, Rose adopted that nickname as <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor.</b> In Ken Burns' documentary Baseball, Mickey Mantle claimed that Ford gave Rose the nickname after Rose, playing in left field, made an effort to climb the fence to try to catch a Mantle home run that everyone could see was headed over everything.|$|E

2500|$|Although Chinese {{culture is}} replete with lists of {{significant}} works or achievements (e.g. Four Great Beauties, [...] Four Great Books of Song, Four Great Classical Novels, Four Books and Five Classics, Five Elders, Three Hundred Tang Poems, etc.), {{the concept of the}} Four Great Inventions originated from the West, and is adapted from the European intellectual and rhetorical commonplace of the Three Great (or, more properly, Greatest) Inventions. This commonplace spread rapidly throughout Europe in the 16th century and was appropriated only in recent times by Chinese scholars. The origin of the Three Great Inventions—these being the printing press, firearms, and the nautical compass—was originally ascribed to Europe, and specifically to Germany {{in the case of the}} printing press and firearms. These inventions were <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> <b>honor</b> to modern Europeans, who proclaimed that there was nothing to equal them among the ancient Greeks and Romans. After reports by Portuguese sailors and Spanish missionaries began to filter back to Europe beginning in the 1530s, the notion that these inventions had existed for centuries in China took hold. By 1620, when Francis Bacon wrote in his Instauratio magna that [...] "printing, gunpowder, and the nautical compass [...] [...] [...] have altered the face and state of the world: first, in literary matters; second, in warfare; third, in navigation," [...] this was hardly an original idea to most learned Europeans.|$|E
2500|$|On June 7, 1862, Butler {{ordered the}} {{execution}} of William B. Mumford for tearing down a United States flag placed by Admiral Farragut on the United States Mint in New Orleans.

Before Mumford was executed Butler permitted him to make a speech {{for as long as he}} wished, where Mumford defended his actions claiming that he was acting out of a high sense of patriotism. Most, including Mumford and his family, expected Butler to pardon him; the general refused, but promised to care for his family if necessary. (After the war Butler fulfilled his promise, paying off a mortgage on Mumford's widow's house and helping her find government employment.) For the execution and General Order No. 28 he was denounced (December 1862) by Confederate President Jefferson Davis in General Order 111 as a felon deserving capital punishment, who if captured should be reserved for execution. [...] Butler's action was successful in reducing the number of violent acts and vandalism made against the Union occupiers.|$|E
