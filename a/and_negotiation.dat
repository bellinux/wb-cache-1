5|$|Following {{the release}} of Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, the team {{intended}} to continue updating the game with post-release content, develop a port for the Xbox console, and create a sequel. Projected to take only nine months to develop, the Xbox version also known as , was released in 2005, {{four years after the}} game's initial release. The reason for the long development cycle stemmed from the team's unfamiliarity with the console's structure. With {{the release of}} a new generation of hardware including a new Xbox console, Elites release did not gain its audience's attention. Sales were lackluster and the development suffered a huge financial loss. In 2005 the company also founded the Independent Developers Association (IDEA) with Black Element Software and Altar Games.

5|$|Muirchertach was {{skilled in}} diplomacy, <b>and</b> <b>negotiation</b> with the dowries {{of his daughters}} may {{have been part of}} a {{political}} game. While he may not have intended to honour his agreements with Magnus (or others), he needed the latter's assistance to crush Domnall. Magnus and Muirchertach went on joint raiding expeditions after the peace agreement, only interrupted by the winter of 1102–03. The sagas claim that Magnus wintered in Connacht, but since Connacht is incorrectly claimed to be Muirchertach's kingdom the location was corrected to Kincora, Munster by modern historians. Rosemary Power considered it more likely that Magnus would have kept his fleet near Dublin. Magnus was probably allied with Muirchertach during his campaigns against Domnall and the Cenél nEógain in 1103, but (in contrast to the Norse sources) Irish sources (the Annals of Ulster and Annals of the Four Masters) do not describe their campaigns as successful. On 5 August 1103, Muirchertach unsuccessfully tried to subdue Domnall in the Battle of Mag Coba. Magnus did not take part, but his Dublin subjects fought with Muirchertach. Since Magnus was closing in on the Irish throne, Muirchertach may have wanted him out of the way. According to Morkinskinna and Heimskringla, the two agreed that Muirchertach was to bring Magnus and his men cattle provisions for their return to Norway; as this dragged on past the agreed time, Magnus became suspicious that the Irish planned an attack. He gathered his men on St. Bartholomew's Day (or the day before, according to Ágrip), 24 August 1103, and ventured into the country. It is possible that Magnus and his men made an incautious landing to raid cattle, or the Ulaid mistook the Norwegians for cattle-raiding Hebrideans. Alternatively, Muirchertach may have ordered the Ulaid to bring provisions to Magnus, inciting the Ulaid to ambush the Norwegians.|$|E

40|$|We study a novel {{data set}} on the auctions <b>and</b> <b>negotiations</b> {{conducted}} prior to the public announcement of a corporate takeover. We use this data to test different theories that model the wealth effects that the choice of an auction or a negotiation has on the target, the bidder, and the combined firm in a takeover. We find that the returns to target firms are comparable in auctions <b>and</b> <b>negotiations.</b> The results hold both in singleequation analysis and in two-stage regressions that control for the endogeneity of the choice between an auction <b>and</b> a <b>negotiation.</b> We also find that bidder returns do not differ between auctions <b>and</b> <b>negotiations</b> <b>and</b> that bidder returns in auctions are insignificantly different from zero, suggesting {{the lack of a}} winner’s curse for the takeovers in our sample. Finally, we find that the combined returns are similar for auctions <b>and</b> <b>negotiations.</b> Overall, the results are consistent with the models of French and McCormick (1984) and Hansen (1987, 2001) that argue that the choice between an auction <b>and</b> a <b>negotiation</b> in a particular takeover reflects a trade-off between competition and information costs.
