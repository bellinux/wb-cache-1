2500|$|While male {{prisoners were}} {{often used in}} single studies, so {{that the results of}} the {{experimentation}} on them would not be clouded by other variables, women were sometimes used in bacteriological or physiological experiments, sex experiments, and as the victims of sex crimes. The testimony of a unit member that served as guard graphically demonstrated this reality:"One of the former researchers I located told me that one day he had a human experiment scheduled, but there was still time to kill. So he and another unit member took the keys to the cells and opened one that housed a Chinese woman. One of the unit members raped her; the other member took the keys and opened another cell. There was a Chinese woman in there who had been used in a frostbite experiment. She had several fingers missing and her bones were black, with gangrene set in. He was about to rape her anyway, then he saw that her sex organ was festering, with pus oozing to the surface. He gave up the idea, left <b>and</b> <b>locked</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> then later went on to his experimental work." ...|$|E

60|$|Ken {{found himself}} running across Grant Field, pursued by a happy, roaring mob of students. They {{might have been}} Indians, judging from the way Ken and his fellow-players fled before them.

The boys bounded up the street into the training-house <b>and</b> <b>locked</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> till the puffing Arthurs arrived. They let him in <b>and</b> <b>locked</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> again.|$|E

60|$|So did his father, for Godfrey {{heard him}} go to his study <b>and</b> <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> doubtless as a sign and a token.|$|R
60|$|There came a {{knock at}} <b>the</b> outer office <b>door.</b> Eddie sprang back into the front room, closing <b>and</b> <b>locking</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> after him, just as Barbara entered.|$|R
60|$|Poor Oliver unwillingly complied. Master Bates {{rolling up}} the new clothes under his arm, {{departed}} from the room, leaving Oliver in <b>the</b> dark, <b>and</b> <b>locking</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> behind him.|$|R

60|$|He {{got up and}} went. Defeat was {{apparent}} enough, although it was unexpected. Lois stole back to the house--stole {{back to her room}} <b>and</b> <b>locked</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "That's right," [...] said Mrs. Petty. [...] "I trust you." [...] And, bolting the window, she whisked out of {{the room}} <b>and</b> <b>locked</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> behind her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thy {{wife and}} cousin--so they say;--hope they may be; they may stay till twelve;" [...] wheezingly {{answered}} a turnkey, pushing the tottering girls into <b>the</b> cell, <b>and</b> <b>locking</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> upon them.|$|R
