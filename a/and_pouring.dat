5|$|One of the {{thatched}} {{houses in}} Little Thetford {{was destroyed by}} fire. Reported in the Cambridge Chronicle 6 November 1930, {{the cause of the}} fire at the c.13th-century six-room building was not known. Fireworks were being discharged {{at the other end of}} the village. All that remained were burnt beams and smouldering walls, which were apparently made of old fen-mud. The villagers saved the nearby Three Horseshoes public house, by forming a bucket chain, <b>and</b> <b>pouring</b> water on its thatched roof.|$|E
5|$|A {{groundbreaking}} {{ceremony for}} the first Swift station, located at Airport Road in south Everett, was held on December 3, 2008, and was attended by Community Transit CEO Joyce Eleanor, U.S. Senator Patty Murray, and the mayors of Everett and Marysville. Stations were constructed in two phases: the first consisting of utility relocation <b>and</b> <b>pouring</b> of the concrete shelter pad; the second being {{the installation of the}} shelters, beacons, and other amenities beginning in June 2009. The first station to be completed, a training facility at the Merrill Creek bus base, was opened during a media event on May 5, 2009; in September 2009, the first station on the line was completed at 196th Street in Lynnwood.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{he invited}} Perrie {{to be his}} date after she fell off her bike while staring at him work out on a field <b>and</b> <b>pouring</b> water over his torso to cool down. He helps her up, and gives her a corsage. Toward {{the end of the}} video, they sit on a bench next to the entrance, and see their date walk in with another girl wearing the same corsage as the ones that he had given each of them. They realise that they have all been two-timed by the same guy, and are all dateless. It ends with the girls being each other's date and solemnly dancing whilst {{everyone}} else has a good time. Metro writer Rebecca Lewis noted that the man in the video strongly resembled Perrie's former fiancé Zayn Malik of One Direction. She also wrote that fans had noticed that she was still wearing her engagement ring in the video, meaning that the video was filmed before they split up in August 2015.|$|E

5|$|To {{understand}} {{the effects of}} sand for the Sandman, experiments were done with twelve types of sand, such as splashing, launching it at stuntmen, <b>and</b> <b>pouring</b> it over ledges. The results were mimicked on the computer to create the visual effects for Sandman. For scenes involving visual effects, Thomas Haden Church was super-imposed onto the screen, where computer-generated imagery was then applied. With sand as a possible hazard in scenes that buried actors, ground-up corncobs were used as a substitute instead. Because of its resemblance to the substance, sand from Arizona {{was used as the}} model for the CG sand. In a fight where Spider-Man punches through Sandman's chest, amputee martial arts expert Baxter Humby took Tobey Maguire's place in filming the scene. Humby, whose right hand was amputated at birth, helped deliver the intended effect of punching through Sandman's chest.|$|E
5|$|By 21:15, Pinsum {{realised}} {{that his}} heavily laden ship could not outrun Amethyst and reduced his speed, turning sharply {{in front of}} the British ship in an attempt to rake her. Seymour was prepared for the manoeuvre and countered it by turning sharply away from Thétis so that the French broadside fell harmlessly into the sea and both frigates performed a complete circle before returning to their previous course. Seymour then swung back towards the French ship, bringing Amethyst alongside <b>and</b> <b>pouring</b> a heavy fire into Thétis, which replied in kind. For 25 minutes, the frigates continued firing on one another from close range as they sailed westwards. At 21:40, Pinsum again attempted to rake Amethyst, trying to cross the British ship's stern as she pulled ahead. Seymour countered by slowing his ship and the French rigging became tangled in the British, the firing continuing as the crews worked to free their ships from one another. Separating a few minutes later, the frigates continued their close-range duel. Amethyst again pulled ahead at 22:05, Seymour successfully crossing the bow of the French ship from port and raking her before swinging back along the starboard side to resume the close range exchange of broadsides.|$|E
25|$|Another {{factor that}} also precipitated {{the move to}} Dallas {{was the fact that}} the team refused to be moved to the Target Center, where the NBA's Minnesota Timberwolves played, due to the fact that the Target Center had {{advertising}} <b>and</b> <b>pouring</b> rights for Coca-Cola at their arena, whereas the North Stars and the Met Center had Pepsi as their sponsor.|$|E

25|$|Converting the {{assembled}} barges into landing craft involved cutting {{an opening in}} the bow for off-loading troops and vehicles, welding longitudinal I-beams and transverse braces to the hull to improve seaworthiness, adding a wooden internal ramp <b>and</b> <b>pouring</b> a concrete floor in the hold to allow for tank transport.

Sulfonated melamine formaldehyde (SMF) is a polymer used as cement admixture {{to reduce the}} water content in concrete while increasing the fluidity and the workability of the mix during its handling <b>and</b> <b>pouring.</b> It results in concrete with a lower porosity and a higher mechanical strength, exhibiting an improved resistance to aggressive environments and a longer lifetime.|$|E

25|$|In December 2007, The Washington Post {{reported}} {{that there were some}} discrepancies regarding reports about the number of times Zubaydah was waterboarded. According to a previous account by former CIA officer John Kiriakou, Abu Zubaydah broke after just 35seconds of waterboarding, which involved stretching cellophane over his mouth and nose <b>and</b> <b>pouring</b> water on his face to create the sensation of drowning. Kiriakou later admitted that he had no first hand knowledge of the interrogation and accused the CIA of using him to spread disinformation.|$|E
25|$|Although Flagler {{remained}} {{on the board of}} directors of Standard Oil, he gave up his day-to-day involvement in the corporation to pursue his interests in Florida.

The project's two tunnel boring machines arrived at University of Washington station for assembly in April 2011 and were dedicated by local and state politicians on May 16. The tunnel boring machines were launched in June and July towards Capitol Hill station, arriving in spring 2012. Station box excavation was completed in June 2012, and contractors Hoffman Construction Company moved on to steel erection <b>and</b> <b>pouring</b> {{of the station}}'s upper levels.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, both Japanese {{military}} personnel, {{especially the}} Kempeitai, {{and the officers}} of the Gestapo, the German secret police, used waterboarding {{as a method of}} torture. During the Japanese occupation of Singapore, the Double Tenth Incident occurred. This included waterboarding, by the method of binding or holding down the victim on his back, placing a cloth over his mouth and nose, <b>and</b> <b>pouring</b> water onto the cloth. In this version, interrogation continued during the torture, with the interrogators beating the victim if he did not reply and the victim swallowing water if he opened his mouth to answer or breathe. When the victim could ingest no more water, the interrogators would beat or jump on his distended stomach.|$|E

The weavers kept the floor beneath the loom moist, sometimes by digging channels into the clay floor <b>and</b> <b>pouring</b> in water. The loomshop was entered through the family accommodation so humidity was not lost to the outside. In such a cottage, one ground floor room became the manufactory, and the family lived in the other, a kitchen living room. Sometimes a basement was excavated beneath the family home lit by elongated windows. The term 'cellar loomshop' was used for both ground floor and basement establishments.|$|E

25|$|Though the feud raised many {{concerns}} {{as to its}} effect on the league, and the Russian national team at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, it apparently dissipated as mysteriously as it started.

Malkin handed Ovechkin his props for the stunt as well as handing him his stick <b>and</b> <b>pouring</b> some sports drink down Ovechkin's throat. Though there is no final word on the nature and status of the feud, considering their past interactions, this incident appears to show that the feud has effectively ended.
