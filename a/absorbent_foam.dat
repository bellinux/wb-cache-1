40|$|<b>Absorbent</b> <b>foams</b> were {{produced}} {{at both the}} gram scale and the kilogram scale by treating bleached softwood kraft pulp fibers to TEMPO oxidation, followed by washing, fiber disintegration, and freeze drying. Two reaction temperatures and three different dosages of primary oxidant were evaluated to find suitable oxidation conditions.

SEM studies showed that the kilogram-scale foams had larger pores than the gram-scale foams; this explains the major differences in absorption and retention. The oxidation treatments performed in both scales resulted in a major increase in the amount of carboxylate groups and a major decrease in DPV, but only minor differences in these factors were found in a comparison between pulps from gram-and kilogram-scale experiments. However, the kilogram-scale dispersing equipment appeared to cause more fiber cutting, while the equipment used in the gram-scale experiments promoted the liberation of microfibrils to a greater extent. Furthermore, in both the gram- and kilogram-scale samples, a high dosage of primary oxidant and a low oxidation temperature were found to maximize the retention of liquid...|$|R
50|$|The RingMute is a {{dampening}} ring (Patent US 7049501 B2) that {{attaches to the}} bell rim of a standard Bb trumpet. Since the mute {{is attached to the}} outside of the trumpet and is not placed inside the trumpet, it is known as an external mute. The construction consists of a lightweight urethane foam ring held in place by an adhesive strip. The distinctive round shape of the RingMute is maintained over time by a cardboard (or similar material) round mold that is placed inside the {{dampening ring}} where the bell rim would normally go. The purpose of the RingMute is twofold:1)According to the University of New South Wales, Sydney Australia, the highest overtones that typically give the trumpet its brassy sound, are emitted at the bell rim.(Brass Acoustics: An Introduction(newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/brassacoustics.html). The <b>absorbent</b> <b>foam</b> dampening ring is attached to the bell rim of a Bb trumpet and assists in diminishing the higher overtones. This is helpful when performing in small areas where the sound of a trumpet can be overbearing but the performer wishes to maintain an open trumpet sound. 2)The other use of the RingMute is when practicing in apartments or close areas where the sound can be disturbing to others. An interesting feature that the RingMute possesses that many mutes do not is that intonation is basically unaltered. With almost all internal mutes such as Harmon, Straight, Cup, Renuzit, etc. that are fitted into the trumpet, the main tuning slide must be extended from its normal setting in order to be in tune. This adjustment is due to the opening of the trumpet bell being plugged. The RingMute Dampening Ring (by virtue of being an external mute and fitted onto the trumpet)requires no altering of the main tuning slide.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to develop}} new materials based on renewable resources that can fulfill the functions necessary in the absorption core of a disposable diaper. <b>Absorbent</b> <b>foam</b> was recently produced from softwood kraft pulp by TEMPO oxidation, disintegration and freeze drying. In this study, the TEMPO-oxidized MFC was mixed with pulp fibres, thus forming a cellulosic composite, {{in an attempt to}} improve the mechanical stability of the freeze-dried absorbent material. The fibres were added in different amounts and the freeze-dried materials were evaluated for their absorption and retention properties. The {{results of this study suggest}} that the composite material has a better mechanical stability than the <b>absorbent</b> <b>foam</b> without fibres. It was shown that using spruce CTMP fibres in the composite resulted in better absorption and retention capacities than in a composite with softwood kraft pulp fibres. The higher stiffness of the CTMP fibres is a probable explanation for this difference. For the composite material with CTMP fibres, liquid porosimetry showed that pore size distribution was more or less retained when put under load. Furthermore, it was seen that the retention properties reached a maximum around 85 % CTMP fibres and 15 % TEMPO-oxidized MFC. In the centrifuge retention test, the retention of the TEMPO-oxidized MFC in the composite material reached about the same capacity as conventional superabsorbent polymers...|$|E

The blend of industrial and residential areas in turn resulted in many environmental problems. In particular, machine operation causes noise pollution that easily causes physiological and psychological discomfort for the human body thus makes noise abatement a crucial and urgent issue. In this study, vermiculite functional fillers were added to polyurethane (PU) foam mixtures in order to form sound <b>absorbent</b> PU <b>foams.</b> The correlations between the contents of functional fillers and the sound absorption of flexible and rigid PU foams were then examined. The optimal PU foams were combined with PET/carbon fiber matrices in order to yield the electromagnetic shielding effectiveness.

These materials can be submitted to low energy impacts like tool drop, routine operations‚Ä¶ Such impacts can generate damages in the material that significantly reduce the structure strength. A solution to reduce the severity of damages due to impact is to add a mechanical protection on composite structures (patent n¬∞ 2 930 478). In this paper, an experimental study on different concepts of protective layers is presented. This protection is made of a certain thickness of low density energy <b>absorbent</b> material (<b>foam,</b> honeycomb or stacking of hollow spheres) and {{a thin layer of}} composite laminate (Kevlar). Experimental impact tests with a spherical impactor of 20 mm diameter at low velocity and low energy are made on aluminum plates, with different protections, and for different levels of energy.

Resistance of these protections is then compared and discussed, taking into account the thickness and the surface density of the protections...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSanitary pads for {{menstrual hygiene}} have a layered design {{consisting}} of a fluid permeable surface (topsheet), an absorbent core, and an impermeable backing with adhesive. Most sanitary pads employ cellulose-based cores. This describes the safety evaluation of a menstrual pad with an emollient-treated topsheet and a novel polymeric foam core. A quantitative risk assessment was performed, which included: (1) toxicological evaluation of the raw material components; (2) quantitative exposure assessments of pad constituents, accounting for the fluid handling properties of the product and pertinent conditions of use; and (3) risk characterization for exposure to raw materials (e. g., potential for skin irritation, contact sensitization, or systemic effects, if relevant) and to the physical article itself (potential effects on skin friction, etc.). No significant risk of adverse effects was found. Five years of post-market surveillance substantiates that the product is well-tolerated (1 health complaint reported per 2 million products shipped to market) and surpasses women's expectations for menstrual protection and overall comfort and dryness. This report illustrates how the classical risk assessment paradigm, informed by the impact of product design, functionality and pertinent use conditions, allowed the systematic safety evaluation of a personal hygiene product with a novel, non-cellulosic <b>absorbent</b> <b>foam</b> core technology...|$|E
40|$|Underground {{and surface}} arteries for vehicle or railway traffic can create {{vibrations}} that travel to nearby buildings. These vibrations can cause structural damage or human discomfort. Displacement time histories collected from buildings abutting the central surface artery {{were used to}} drive mathematical models so that asphaltic and polymeric bearings could be studied as possible passive mitigators of such vibrations. Neither material attenuated vibrations to below threshold levels for human annoyance, but they could dampen levels to resist structural damage if enough material was used to bring the apparent natural frequency away from the range characteristic of traffic vibration. In addition, for resonant cases, the materials did not create enough damping force to counter the inertia of heavy structures, because the materials were too stiff and the displacements and velocities too small. For new construction, {{it is suggested that}} these vibrations should be prevented from entering the foundation area by surrounding the foundation with a concrete wall or <b>absorbent</b> <b>foam</b> blocks. For retrofits, polymeric or asphaltic pads could be used and would be relatively easy to install. by Diane Lee Bosuego Floresca. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|Superabsorbent {{polymers}} (SAP) have, {{since being}} {{introduced in the}} 1980 s, become an important constituent in hygiene products, such as disposable diapers. The design of disposable diapers {{has changed over the}} years and today thinner products can be produced partly because of the excellent absorption and retention properties of the petrochemical-based SAP. The possibilities of producing alternative absorbent materials from a renewable resource, kraft pulp, are investigated in this thesis. In this work, a four step process was developed using kraft pulp from either softwood or hardwood as the raw material. In the process, kraft pulp fibers were treated with TEMPO oxidation followed by washing, disintegration of the fibers into microfibrillar cellulose (MFC), and porous <b>absorbent</b> <b>foam</b> was then obtained by freeze drying the MFC. Process conditions were evaluated to optimize the properties of the obtained foams. In an attempt to improve the mechanical stability of the foam, un-modified fibres were added before the drying step, thus forming a cellulosic composite material. Tests of absorption properties showed that the absorbent foams had a more rapid absorption rate, similar absorption capacity and about half the retention capacity as compared to commercial SAP. In the foam, wet integrity was provided by the aldehyde groups introduced by TEMPO oxidation possibly through the formation of hemiacetal bonds. A high dosage of primary oxidant and the use of wood from birch as the raw material were the most favourable for maximizing liquid retention in the foams. An increase in the oxidation temperature from 25 ÀöC to 50 ÀöC decreased the reaction time, reduced the energy demand to disintegrate the fibers, while the retention capacity remained more or less unchanged. Washing experiments showed that in comparison with washing reference pulp, oxidized pulps had a higher specific filtration resistance and thus a larger filter area or longer hold-up time was needed for oxidized pulps. The addition of CTMP fibres increased the liquid retention capacity of the TEMPO-oxidized MFC. At fibre contents around 85 %, the retention capacities of the TEMPO-oxidized MFC were comparable with the capacity of commercial SAP. The preparation of foam on the kilogram-scale showed that a similar morphology to gram-scale experiments was not achieved and consequently liquid retention was lower for kilogram-scale foams...|$|E

TEMPO oxidation was performed using five different dosages of primary oxidant. The time of disintegration treatment was varied to study its influence on the properties of the produced MFCs and foams. Both the birch and the softwood pulps could be used for producing superabsorbent foams, depending on the process conditions, the absorption capacities were about the same for the two pulps and varied between 25 and 55 g saline solution/g <b>absorbent.</b> The <b>foams</b> based on birch pulp had, however, on average, 30 % higher retention capacity than the foams based on softwood pulp. The maximum retention capacity obtained was 16. 6 g saline solution/g absorbent. The greater retention capacity of birch-based foams is not fully understood, but a smaller pore size may be the reason, which in turn would generate greater capillary forces. In addition to this, it was found that birch pulps, contrary to softwood pulps, had a substantial amount of fibers that were relatively unaffected by the disintegration treatment. These oxidized fibers are likely to reinforce the foam, thereby making the foam more resistant to external pressures, which is in accordance with earlier findings...|$|R
