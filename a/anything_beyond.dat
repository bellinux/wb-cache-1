5|$|Written by James Follett, this {{involved}} monsters {{attacking a}} race of beings who live inside Halley's Comet, unaware that there is <b>anything</b> <b>beyond</b> it they believe that their world is the sum and total of the universe. Into the Comet would have used the companions of Romana and K9. Follett was a novelist who pitched this idea to script editor Douglas Adams circa September 1979 when they met up and discussed the forthcoming return of Halley's Comet. Unfortunately the storyline was rejected by Adams. Follett resubmitted Into the Comet to new script editor Christopher H. Bidmead around May 1980, but once again the storyline was not pursued.|$|E

25|$|The 1928 {{convention}} {{voted to}} reduce membership dues to just $1 per year, with {{only half of}} that sum going {{to the use of}} the National Office, the balance being retained by state and local organizations. This level of funding proved insufficient for <b>anything</b> <b>beyond</b> the bare minimum of operations by the National Office in Chicago; no official party publication was made available to the members of the organization, with several privately held socialist newspapers fulfilling the function as fonts of party information.|$|E

Of all the teams only the storyline between finalists Rush and El Terrible {{developed}} into a major storyline. The two faced off on several occasion through most of 2012 until the two met in the main event of the CMLL 79th Anniversary Show where Rush defeated El Terrible, forcing El Terrible to be shaved bald due to the Luchas de Apuestas stipulation.|$|E

In retaliation, Tomko cost Styles his King of the Mountain qualifying match against Booker T. At Slammiversary, Styles defeated Angle, but was beat-down by Angle and Tomko after the match. The feud continued through Hard Justice, with Styles and Angle trading wins {{and on the}} following episode of Impact! he defeated Angle for his Olympic gold medal. Styles also won the rematch ladder match the following week to end their feud, but he was later asked to give Angle back his gold medal by Jeff Jarrett {{in an effort to}} try to mend things with Angle.|$|E
25|$|On {{the same}} cliff path where Nofret and Satipy died, Renisenb, {{apparently}} summoned by Hori, hears footsteps {{behind her and}} turns to see Yahmose. She then sees the look of murderous hatred in her brother's eyes that the other women saw before they were killed. On the brink of her own death, she realises that Satipy was not looking in fear at <b>anything</b> <b>beyond</b> Yahmose — she was looking straight at him. He had consumed a non-lethal dose of poison and pretended to recuperate while committing murders, both to make himself chief heir and to indulge his newfound love of violence. As Renisenb realises some of this, Hori slays Yahmose with an arrow and saves her. Hori explains all. Renisenb's final choice is whom to marry: Kameni, a lively husband not unlike her first, or Hori, an older and more enigmatic figure. She makes her choice and falls into Hori’s arms.|$|E
25|$|The college seal, {{designed}} by alumnus Harold G. Gardner and incorporating the college motto, Via, Veritas, Vita, {{was adopted by}} the trustees on the recommendation of the president and the student body in 1932, along with a college banner to display the emblems of , Lux, , Crux. The college had been chartered in 1918 with a school of music, President Gardner secured certification for the college as a teacher-training institution with the Massachusetts Department of Education in 1933, and the college would institute a graduate program in theology starting in 1938, thus becoming one of only two Nazarene schools to offer <b>anything</b> <b>beyond</b> a Bachelor of Arts before 1945. Evolutionary biology was taught in the classroom at least as early as 1937, and on May 8, 1941, Governor Leverett Saltonstall approved Eastern Nazarene to grant Bachelor of Science degrees. ENC also had a cooperative degree program in engineering with Northeastern University by 1943.|$|E
60|$|Incredulity is {{sometimes}} the vice of a fool, and credulity the defect {{of a man}} of intelligence. The latter sees far into the immensity of the Possible; the former scarcely sees <b>anything</b> possible <b>beyond</b> the Actual. Perhaps this is what produces the timidity of the one, and the temerity of the other.|$|R

25|$|The second series, Ben Harper, {{husband and}} father to three {{different}} and often difficult children, has spent his working life as a dentist. Just {{as well as most}} of his life seems rather like pulling teeth. His wife Susan is usually busy showing foreign tourists around London, a place she knows much better than her own kitchen. Ben and Susan have been married happily enough to have three children. However, Ben has the feeling that most of the time his children seem to speak a different language. Nick (20) has persuaded his parents he would benefit from a gap year to see something of the world, but he has hardly seen <b>anything</b> <b>beyond</b> the confines of the sofa. Janey (17) is into boys, fashion labels (expensive ones), and getting her own way. Michael (14) is the brightest of the trio. He is seriously into computers and not so seriously (yet) into girls.|$|E
25|$|Apart from that, Reform {{had little}} to no {{influence}} {{in the rest of}} the continent. Radical lay societies sprang in Hungary during the 1848 Revolution but soon dispersed. Only in Germany, commented Steven M. Lowenstein, did the extinction of old Jewish community life lead to the creation of a new, positive religious ideology that advocated principled change. In Western and Central Europe, personal observance disappeared, but the public was not interested in bridging the gap between themselves and the official faith. Secular education for clergy became mandated by mid-century, and yeshivas all closed due to lack of applicants, replaced by modern seminaries; the new academically-trained rabbinate, whether affirming basically traditional doctrines or liberal and influenced by Wissenschaft, was scarcely prone to <b>anything</b> <b>beyond</b> aesthetic modifications and de facto tolerance of the laity's apathy. Further to the east, among the unemancipated and unacculturated Jewish masses in Poland, Romania and Russia, the stimulants that gave rise either to Reform or modernist Orthodoxy were virtually unheard of. The few rich and westernized Jews in cities like Odessa or Warsaw constructed modern synagogues where mild aesthetic reforms, like vernacular sermons or holding the wedding canopy indoors rather than under the sky, were introduced. Regarded as boldly innovative in their environs, these were long since considered trivial even by the most Orthodox in Germany, Bohemia or Moravia. In the east, the belated breakdown of old mores led not to the remodification of religion, but to the formulation of secular conceptions of Jewishness, especially nationalistic ones.|$|E
25|$|From 1897 to 1899, Zitkala-Ša played violin {{with the}} New England Conservatory of Music in Boston. In 1899, {{she took a}} {{position}} at the Carlisle Indian School where she taught music to the children and conducted debates on the treatment of Native Americans. In 1900, Zitkala-Ša played violin at the Paris Exposition with the school's Carlisle Indian Band. In the same year, she began writing articles on Native American life which were published in such popular periodicals as Atlantic Monthly and Harper's Monthly. Also in 1900, Zitkala-Ša was sent by Captain Pratt back to the Yankton Reservation {{for the first time}} in several years to recruit students. She was greatly dismayed to find there that her mother's house in disrepair, her brother's family in poverty, and that white settlers were beginning to occupy the land promised to the Yankton Dakota by the Dawes Act of 1877. Upon returning to Carlisle, she came into conflict with Pratt. She resented the rigid program of assimilation and argued that the curriculum did not encourage Native American children to aspire to <b>anything</b> <b>beyond</b> lives spent in menial labor. In 1901 Zitkala-Ša was dismissed, likely for an article she had published in Harper's Monthly describing the profound loss of identity felt by a Native American boy after being given an assimilationist education at Carlisle. Concerned with her mother's advanced age and her family's struggles with poverty, she returned to the Yankton Reservation in 1901. Zitkala-Ša dedicated her life to Indian reform, voting rights and education.|$|E

On February 5, 2014, Twitter published its first results as a public company, showing a net loss of $511 million {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2013. On January 5, 2016, CEO Jack Dorsey commented on a report that Twitter planned to expand its character limit to 10,000 (private messages already had the longer limit as of July), requiring users to click to see <b>anything</b> <b>beyond</b> 140 characters.

500|$|Delius, {{but well}} ahead of Grieg and Tchaikovsky.

[...] His failure to be recognised as a composer for <b>anything</b> <b>beyond</b> his [...] popular folk-song arrangements was a source of frustration and disappointment; for years after his death [...] the bulk of his output remained largely unperformed. From the 1990s {{an increase in the number}} of Grainger [...] recordings has brought a revival of interest in his works, and has enhanced his reputation as a composer. An unsigned tribute published on the Gramophone website in February 2011 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Grainger's death opined that [...] "though he would never be put on a pedestal to join the pantheon of immortals, he is unorthodox, original and deserves better than to be dismissed by the more snooty arbiters of musical taste".|$|E

500|$|On {{the other}} hand, others thought the music felt forced. Inevitably, almost all reviews, both {{positive}} and negative, compared the episode to Buffy the Vampire Slayers musical episode, [...] "Once More, with Feeling". This comparison was also made by Bill Lawrence, who credits Buffy for inspiring Scrubs propensity for [...] "big" [...] episodes (such as this one, the multi-camera [...] "My Life in Four Cameras", and the Wizard of Oz parody [...] "My Way Home"). The singing abilities of the cast (Chalke in particular) came under some fire, but most critics agreed that most were competent, and that <b>anything</b> <b>beyond</b> that simply did not matter. Reyes and Faison were the only members of the cast (besides the Broadway star D'Abruzzo) to receive praise for their singing abilities. In general, the final assessments were positive. The episode was called [...] "the show's best episode thus far this season", [...] "worth all the hype", and [...] "a {{heck of a lot}} of fun". The episode is also the most popular download of the entire series of Scrubs in the iTunes Store.|$|E
500|$|Good Vibes Gazette {{surveyed}} sex {{toy store}} customers in 1995 {{and asked them}} to rank their opinions of sex toys. The Magic Wand was identified as outstanding. The 1995 book about censorship , which included works confiscated by Canadian authorities for being [...] "obscene", featured a contribution involving a woman who used a Magic Wand for pain relief. In 1997, the Magic Wand was the most popular holiday gift item sold at the Good Vibrations store in Berkeley, California. According to Out magazine, the Magic Wand was the best-selling sex toy of 1998. Chatelaine received criticism from the Alberta Report in 1999 for reporting on the increasing popularity of the Magic Wand and other sex toys among women. In 1999 the Magic Wand was promoted to consumers as a [...] "personal massager" [...] device. The Village Voice reported in 1999 that the device was marketed by the company as the [...] "Hitachi Magic Wand Household Electric Massager".

500|$|Smithers' {{relationship}} with Mr. Burns {{has long been}} a running gag on The Simpsons. Smithers is an obedient and sycophantic assistant to Mr. Burns. There have often been strong hints about Smithers' true feelings for his boss, with one of the earliest references being in the season one episode [...] "The Telltale Head". Smithers' sexual orientation has often come into question, with some fans claiming he is a [...] "Burns-sexual" [...] and only attracted to his boss, while others maintain that he is, without a doubt, gay. During the Bill Oakley/Josh Weinstein era, they still tried to keep his sexuality mysterious and there was debate among the writers about his orientation. Al Jean, who thinks of Smithers as being a [...] "Burns-sexual", felt that had Mr. Burns been a woman, then Smithers would not be gay. David Silverman, a former supervising director has said, [...] " [...] seems to be focused on one particular human, as opposed to <b>anything</b> <b>beyond</b> that. , he's sort of 'Burns-sexual.'" [...] In a 2006 study conducted by the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, it was determined that nine of the 679 lead and supporting characters on scripted broadcast television were gay or lesbian, but Smithers was not included.
