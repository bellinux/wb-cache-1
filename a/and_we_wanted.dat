25|$|On {{all their}} {{projects}} since 1972 they worked exclusively with photographer Wolfgang Volz. At least five of their major projects were subjects of documentary films by Albert and David Maysles. Although, Jeanne-Claude and Christo worked as creative equals {{on all of}} their art projects, only Christo’s name appeared on the finished products. This was a conscious decision by both Jeanne-Claude and Christo because of the prejudices against female artists in the art world. Jeanne-Claude said, “‘The decision to use only the name Christo was made deliberately {{when we were young}} because it was difficult for one artist to be established <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to put all the chances on our side.’” Therefore, Jeanne-Claude took on the role as Christo’s manager in order to advance their success. The pair did not reveal Jeanne-Claude as the second half in the creative process until 1994.|$|E

Whannell wanted to play the lead character in the feature film. The short helped show that Wan and Whannell was a [...] "director-actor team" [...] rather than just wanting to sell the script. Wan said, [...] "Leigh and I just loved the project so much <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> a career in filmmaking so we stuck to our guns and said, 'Look, guys, if you want this project, we're coming on board - Leigh has to act in it and I have to direct it." ...|$|E

We didn’t want it to feel ridiculously futuristic or viewers would be jarred by the contrast." [...] Bree's garage was remodeled into a testing kitchen as result of the character's catering business. Additionally, all houses were repainted with bolder colors, with the exception of Gabrielle's home, in order to reflect the Solis' financial situation.|$|E
500|$|The {{basic concept}} behind [...] "Rush" [...] {{had been coming}} {{together}} since the sixth season. According to series creator Chris Carter, {{the way in which}} to portray the teenagers on screen was [...] "tricky". He noted, [...] "it {{had been a long time}} since we had dealt with teenage angst. [...] it was being done everywhere else <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to take a run at it." [...] David Amman, who wrote the episode, later explained that the original idea for the episode was simply [...] " [...] effect having the power of super speed would have on troubled teens." [...] However, the story quickly developed [...] "deeper" [...] meanings: drug abuse, boredom, and the teenage experience.|$|E

500|$|The {{members of}} DecembeRadio all began playing music in their teens. [...] Josh Reedy and Brian Bunn {{attended}} the same schools, and the former's rendition of [...] "Johnny B.

We played Hootie & the Blowfish covers {{and that sort of}} thing. Then shortly thereafter, we realized that God had given us these gifts, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to utilize them for him," [...] recalled Bunn. [...] The pair decided to pursue music full-time upon graduation from Auburn High School in Riner, Virginia.|$|E
500|$|The title track, Loughnan's [...] "Big Red Rock", is an eight-and-a-half minute {{instrumental}} {{described by}} Juke Magazine as [...] "expertly capturing the stark loneliness and cosmic tranquility one gets standing before their namesake rock". According to Loughnan, the atmosphere {{they wanted to}} create was [...] "that spacey sort of feeling—like desert <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to get {{the sound of the}} didgeridoo—which we did electronically". Doyle imitated a didgeridoo by playing guitar with a wah-wah pedal. Tony Catterall of The Canberra Times praised [...] "Big Red Rock", saying that it [...] "suggests the huge expanse of the outback, then takes you to the Aboriginal secrets [...] the power surrounding the area [...] in a burst of truly inspired musicianship".|$|E
500|$|In a {{deviation}} from the previous films, the Spinosaurus is considered the primary antagonist: Johnston stated, [...] "A lot of dinosaurs have a very similar silhouette to the T-Rex ... <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> the audience to instantly recognize this as something else." [...] The silhouette of the Spinosaurus {{is also on the}} poster behind the Pteranodon, taking the place of the Tyrannosaurus which had been used in the previous films' posters. Baryonyx was originally considered to be the [...] "big bad" [...] before Spinosaurus was chosen, and early concept posters reflected this. Within film dialogue, Billy interprets the animal encountered as a Baryonyx or Suchomimus, but Dr. Grant corrects his analysis based on its size and its sail.|$|E

I had been to a music festival so I hadn't slept the whole weekend. Then I was jumping in the Irish sea. It was a totally manic day. We did a million different takes.

500|$|An {{interview}} with actress Kristin Chenoweth, who was originally cast as Rapunzel, reveals {{that at some}} point Rapunzel was intended to be a squirrel. As directors, Greno and Howard felt it essential that Rapunzel resemble a less [...] "passive" [...] heroine than the way she is depicted in the original fairy tale. [...] "We knew we were making this movie for a contemporary audience <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> Rapunzel to be a real role model in a way. We wanted all this girl power and to really drive this story, so she doesn't wait around for anything ... she's a smart girl, she has these hopes and dreams and she's going to get what she wants out of life."

500|$|In June 2008, EMI {{released}} a greatest hits album, [...] It was made without Radiohead's input and only contains songs released under their recording contract with EMI. Yorke {{was critical of}} the release, saying: [...] "There's {{nothing we can do}} about it. The work is really public property now anyway, in my head at least. It's a wasted opportunity in that if we'd been behind it, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to do it, then it might have been good." [...] In August 2008, EMI reissued [...] "special editions" [...] of Radiohead's back catalogue as part of its [...] "From the Capitol Vaults" [...] series. From mid-2008 to early 2009, Radiohead toured North America, Europe, Japan and South America to promote In Rainbows, and headlined the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2009.|$|E

500|$|Yeats {{used the}} {{occasion}} of his acceptance lecture at the Royal Academy of Sweden to present himself as a standard-bearer of Irish nationalism and Irish cultural independence. As he remarked, [...] "The theatres of Dublin were empty buildings hired by the English travelling companies, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> Irish plays and Irish players. When we thought of these plays we thought of everything that was romantic and poetical, because the nationalism we had called up—the nationalism every generation had called up in moments of discouragement—was romantic and poetical." [...] The prize led to {{a significant increase in}} the sales of his books, as his publishers Macmillan sought to capitalise on the publicity. For the first time he had money, and he was able to repay not only his own debts, but those of his father.|$|E
500|$|Black Sabbath {{began work}} on their sixth album in February 1975, again in England at Morgan Studios in Willesden, {{this time with a}} decisive vision to differ the sound from Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath. [...] "We could've {{continued}} and gone on and on, getting more technical, using orchestras and everything else which we didn't particularly want to. We took a look at ourselves, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to do a rock album – Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath wasn't a rock album, really." [...] Produced by Black Sabbath and Mike Butcher, Sabotage was released in July 1975. As with its precursor, the album initially saw favourable reviews, with Rolling Stone stating [...] "Sabotage is not only Black Sabbath's best record since Paranoid, it might be their best ever", although later reviewers such as AllMusic noted that [...] "the magical chemistry that made such albums as Paranoid and Volume 4 so special was beginning to disintegrate".|$|E
500|$|The band {{wanted to}} avoid repeating the {{protracted}} recording process of their previous album In Rainbows (2007).

[...] Cover artist Stanley Donwood said: [...] "In Rainbows was very much a definitive statement, and that isn't where the band are at the moment. Where they are now is more transitory ... this album shows where Radiohead are at the moment the record was released. The music is a continuing thing. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to make the album representative of that." [...] Multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood told Rolling Stone that the band had not wanted to [...] "pick up guitars and write chord sequences. We didn't want to sit {{in front of a computer}} either. We wanted a third thing, which involved playing and programming." ...|$|E
