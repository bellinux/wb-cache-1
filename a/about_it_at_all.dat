Yet what he did write {{turned out to be a}} major piece of literary criticism that contributed to his general concepts about tragedy and poetry, and made a powerful impression on the poet John Keats.|$|E
500|$|We paid our {{shilling}} at the gate, {{and then}} we saw for the first time, that the entrance, {{if there had been}} any magic <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> was now decidedly disenchanted, being, in fact, nothing more nor less than a combination of very roughly-painted boards and sawdust. We glanced at the orchestra and supper-room as we hurried past—we just recognised them, and that was all. We bent our steps to the firework-ground; there, at least, we should not be disappointed. We reached it, and stood rooted to the spot with mortification and astonishment. That the Moorish tower—that wooden shed with a door in the centre, and daubs of crimson and yellow all round, like a gigantic watch-case! That the place where night after night we had beheld the undaunted Mr. Blackmore make his terrific ascent, surrounded by flames of fire, and peals of artillery, and where the white garments of Madame Somebody (we forget even her name now), who nobly devoted her life to the manufacture of fireworks, had so often been seen fluttering in the wind, as she called up a red, blue, or party-coloured light to illumine her temple! ...|$|E
500|$|Heydrich {{spoke for}} nearly an hour. Then {{followed}} about thirty minutes of questions and comments, followed by some less formal conversation. Otto Hofmann (head of the SS Race and Settlement Main Office (RuSHA)) [...] and Wilhelm Stuckart (State Secretary of the Reich Interior Ministry) pointed out the legalistic and administrative difficulties over mixed marriages, and suggested compulsory dissolution of mixed marriages or the wider use of sterilisation as a simpler alternative. Erich Neumann from the Four Year Plan argued for the exemption of Jews who were working in industries vital {{to the war effort}} and for whom no replacements were available. Heydrich assured him that this was already the policy; such Jews would not be killed. Josef Bühler, State Secretary of the General Government, stated his support for the plan and his hope that the killings would commence as soon as possible. Towards the end of the meeting cognac was served, and after that the conversation became less restrained. [...] "The gentlemen were standing together, or sitting together", Eichmann said, [...] "and were discussing the subject quite bluntly, quite differently from the language which I had to use later in the record. During the conversation they minced no words <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>all...</b> they spoke about methods of killing, about liquidation, about extermination". Eichmann recorded that Heydrich was pleased with the course of the meeting. He had expected a lot of resistance, Eichmann recalled, but instead he had found [...] "an atmosphere not only of agreement {{on the part of the}} participants, but more than that, one could feel an agreement which had assumed a form which had not been expected".|$|E

I honestly don't understand the big fuss made over nudity and sex in films. It's silly.

I think that as far as children are concerned, parents should have control over what they listen to. If they don't want them to listen to records that are very sexual or explicit or outrageous, they should have control over that situation. As for adults, they're going to buy whatever kind of music they want to hear, so if they buy music with explicit lyrics, they must like it." ...|$|E
2500|$|After much {{personal}} {{struggle and}} a turbulent on-off engagement, he married the Chilean-born American actress Felicia Cohn Montealegre on September 10, 1951. One {{suggestion is that}} he chose to marry partly to dispel rumors about his private life to help secure a major conducting appointment, following advice from his mentor Dimitri Mitropoulos about the conservative nature of orchestra boards. In a book released in October 2013, The Leonard Bernstein Letters, his wife reveals his homosexuality. Felicia writes: [...] "you are a homosexual and may never change—you don’t admit {{to the possibility of}} a double life, but if your peace of mind, your health, your whole nervous system depend on a certain sexual pattern what can you do?" [...] Arthur Laurents (Bernstein's collaborator in West Side Story) said that Bernstein was [...] "a gay man who got married. He wasn't conflicted <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> He was just gay." [...] Shirley Rhoades Perle, another friend of Bernstein, said that she thought [...] "he required men sexually and women emotionally." [...] But the early years of his marriage seem to have been happy, and no one has suggested Bernstein and his wife didn't love each other. They had three children, Jamie, Alexander, and later Nina. There are reports, though, that Bernstein did sometimes have brief extramarital liaisons with young men, which several family friends have said his wife knew about.|$|E

50|$|Bruce Beresford {{claimed the}} film was often {{misunderstood}} as the story of men railroaded by the British:But that's not what <b>it's</b> <b>about</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> The film never pretended {{for a moment that}} they weren't guilty. It said they are guilty. But what was interesting <b>about</b> <b>it</b> was that it analysed why men in this situation would behave as they had never behaved before in their lives. It's the pressures that are put to bear on people in war time... Look <b>at</b> <b>all</b> the things that happen in these countries committed by people who appear to be quite normal. That was what I was interested in examining. I always get amazed when people say to me that this is a film about poor Australians who were framed by the Brits.|$|R

60|$|GILBERT. More {{difficult}} to do a thing than to talk <b>about</b> <b>it?</b> Not <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> That is a gross popular error. It is very much more {{difficult to}} talk about a thing than to do it. In the sphere of actual life that is of course obvious. Anybody can make history. Only a great man can write it. There is no mode of action, no form of emotion, that we do not share with the lower animals. It is only by language that we rise above them, or above each other--by language, which is the parent, and not the child, of thought. Action, indeed, is always easy, and when presented to us in its most aggravated, because most continuous form, which I take to be that of real industry, becomes simply the refuge of people who have nothing whatsoever to do. No, Ernest, don't talk <b>about</b> action. <b>It</b> is a blind thing dependent on external influences, and moved by an impulse of whose nature it is unconscious. It is a thing incomplete in its essence, because limited by accident, and ignorant of its direction, being always at variance with its aim. Its basis is the lack of imagination. It is the last resource of those who know not how to dream.|$|R
40|$|Some {{years ago}} I {{went to visit}} Max Weber’s old house in Heidelberg on the Ziegelhauser Landstrasse. It was in {{considerable}} disrepair and was used, if I remember rightly, as a student hostel owned by the evangelical church; it had something of {{a reputation as a}} centre for student radicalism. As I wandered <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> nothing <b>at</b> <b>all</b> indicated that <b>it</b> had once been Weber’s home and a centre of some intellectual importance in the life of Heidelberg. It was with a sense of shock that I recognized in the garden the beech tree and the lion fountain mentioned by Marianne Weber in her biography of her husband and her description of their lives there {{in the early years of}} this century. The last time I visited, a year or so ago, things could hardly have been more different: the house had been extensively renovated, its rooms had names (Der Mari-anne Webersaal- that sort of thing) and it was being used as a centre for teaching German as a foreign language. I am not sure which incarnation I pre-ferred. It was as though the house had gone from being an uncomfortable and unassimilated part of Heidelberg’s history to becoming neat, clean and ren...|$|R

60|$|Sometime {{during that}} night Leo {{had a strange}} dream, of which {{he told me the}} next morning. I suppose that {{it must have been a}} dream as {{certainly}} I saw or was aware of nothing. Well, he dreamed--I use his own words as nearly as possible--that again he heard those accursed death-hounds in full cry. Nearer and nearer they came, following our spoor to the edge of the river--all the pack that had run down the horses. At the water's brink they halted and were mute. Then suddenly a puff of wind brought the scent of us upon the island to one of them which lifted up its head and uttered a single bay. The rest clustered <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and <b>all</b> <b>at</b> once they made a dash at the water.|$|R
60|$|So, on {{the sixteenth}} of December, one {{thousand}} six hundred and fifty-three, a great procession was formed at Oliver's door, {{and he came}} out in a black velvet suit and a big pair of boots, and got into his coach and went down to Westminster, attended by the judges, and the lord mayor, and the aldermen, and all the other great and wonderful personages of the country. There, in the Court of Chancery, he publicly accepted the office of Lord Protector. Then he was sworn, and the City sword was handed to him, and the seal was handed to him, and all the other things were handed to him which are usually handed to Kings and Queens on state occasions. When Oliver had handed them all back, he was quite made and completely finished off as Lord Protector; and several of the Ironsides preached <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> great length, <b>all</b> the evening.|$|R

40|$|If truth hurts, this is {{no doubt}} because it is often enough forced on us. And the {{question}} as to whether the reception of “nice,” “easy” truths is similarly an outcome of coercion negates itself in its very formulation—we do not ask “why are things the way they are?” from a feeling of comfort; the plaintiff cry of “how, then, shall we live?” does not come to us {{out of a sense of}} security. Indeed, insofar as truth overtakes us and interrupts the conventions of our lives, it occurs to us quite apart from our ordinary desires and wants. We are thus faced with a paradox: what claim can truth make on a being that “doesn’t need it and doesn’t care <b>about</b> it—since <b>it</b> doesn’t <b>at</b> <b>all</b> concern his needs”? When one considers that the awareness of truth is indexed to lived experience, the paradox is only heightened...|$|R
60|$|It was {{a stormy}} night! and, as I drew down my curtain, I said to myself, after {{peering through the}} driving snow {{to catch a glimpse}} of my neighbour, 'Poor Goldy! he'll have a rough time of it. I hope this northeaster won't blow him off his perch.' Then I sat down by my fire, took my knitting, and began to meditate. I'm sure I didn't fall asleep; but I can't prove it, so we'll say no more <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> <b>All</b> <b>at</b> once there came a tap at my door, as I thought; and I said 'Come in,' just as Mr. Poe did when that {{unpleasant}} raven paid him a call. No one came, so I went to see who it was. Not a sign of a human soul in the long hall, only little Jessie, the poodle, asleep on her mat. Down I sat; but in a minute the tap came again; this time so loud that I knew <b>it</b> was <b>at</b> the window, and went to open it, thinking that one of my doves wanted to come in perhaps. Up went the sash, and in bounced something so big and so bright that it dazzled and scared me.|$|R
60|$|This {{sharpened}} our curiosity to the keenest edge; but {{of course}} we controlled it, hoping he would volunteer some further information with regard to so singular a misfortune; but when day after day went by {{and he did not}} allude to the matter, we got worked up into a fever of excitement <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> One evening after Dennison had gone, we held a kind of political meeting <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> <b>at</b> which <b>all</b> possible and impossible methods of decapitation were suggested as the ones to which Mrs. D. probably owed her extraordinary demise. I am sorry to add that we so far forgot the grave character of the event as to lay small wagers that it was done this way or that way; that it was accidental or premeditated; that she had had a hand in it herself or that it was wrought by circumstances beyond her control. All was mere conjecture, however; but from that time Dennison, as the custodian of a secret upon which we had staked our cash, was an object of more than usual interest. It wasn't entirely that, either; aside from our paltry wagers, we felt a consuming curiosity to know the truth for its own sake. Each set himself to work to elicit the dread secret in some way; and the misdirected ingenuity we developed was wonderful. All sorts of pious devices were resorted to to entice poor Dennison into clearing up the mystery. By a thousand indirect methods we sought to entrap him into divulging all. History, fiction, poesy--all were laid under contribution, and from Goliah down, through Charles I., to Sam Spigger, a local celebrity who got his head entangled in mill machinery, every one who had ever mourned the loss of a head received his due share of attention during office hours. The regularity with which we introduced, and the pertinacity with which we stuck to, this one topic came near getting us all discharged; for one day the cashier came out of his private office and intimated that if we valued our situations the subject of hanging would afford us the means of retaining them. He added that he always selected his subordinates with an eye to their conversational abilities, but variety of subject was as desirable, at times, as exhaustive treatment.|$|R
