25|$|With the Salon d'Automne of {{that same}} year, 1911, the fury broke out again, just as violent {{as it had been}} at the Indépendants.

25|$|Harold is aghast, worried if {{the foreign}} police will believe the story {{both he and}} Elsie have to tell and that their 'relationship' is innocent.

That is until the two Polish women approach Mrs Rice and speak to her.

25|$|Bunthorne, heartbroken by Patience's rejection, {{has chosen}} to raffle himself off among his lady {{followers}} ("Let the merry cymbals sound"), the proceeds going to charity. The Dragoons interrupt the proceedings, and, led by the Duke, attempt to reason with the ladies ("Your maiden hearts, ah, do not steel"), but the ladies are too busy clamouring for tickets to the raffle to listen ("Come walk up"). Just as Bunthorne is handing the bag to the unattractive Jane, ready for the worst, Patience interrupts the proceedings and proposes to unselfishly sacrifice herself by loving the poet ("True Love must single-hearted be").

25|$|As the {{deadline}} nears, the LBA executives begin to panic and lash out, {{resulting in a}} contradictory sequence where Wolfe is fired and then rehired within a span of minutes. When <b>all</b> <b>seems</b> lost, however, an anonymous source sends copies of the answers {{to each of the}} contestants, thus voiding the contest and saving LBA. Although Archie, the LBA executives and the police suspect Wolfe of doing so, he insists that he was not responsible, and begins to suspect one of the advertising executives of at least stealing the wallet, if not murdering Dahlmann. After the letters are sent, Vernon Assa approaches Wolfe and attempts to unilaterally dismiss him from the case, but Wolfe refuses. His suspicions aroused, Wolfe summons the major players to his office and claims he will reveal the identity of the thief, and in doing so provide the police with vital information to help them identify the murderer. Before he can do so, however, Vernon Assa is poisoned with cyanide surreptitiously slipped into his drink and dies on the floor of Wolfe's office. Dahlmann's wallet is found in his pocket, suggesting that he was the thief and murderer.|$|E

500|$|Following the complaints, Fox removed {{any mention}} of Catholicism from the scene, {{resulting}} in the line [...] "The church..." [...] Scully was reportedly furious with Fox's actions. In an interview in Los Angeles Times, Scully said, [...] "people can say hurtful things {{to each other about}} their weight, their race, their intelligence, their sexual preference, and that <b>all</b> <b>seems</b> up for grabs, but when you get into religion, some people get very nervous." [...] Marisa Guthrie of Boston Herald also criticized the network, describing it as [...] "caving in" [...] to the Catholic League's protests. She wrote, [...] "Hollywood has always been gun shy of controversy, but recent displays of self-censorship on the part of entertainment industry executives make us cringe [...] Granted Catholics, as a group have endured an ample amount of bashing, but The Simpsons is an equal opportunity offender." [...] Howard Rosenberg, a writer for Los Angeles Times, criticized Fox's actions as well. He argued that the network had a biased opinion towards Catholicism and that, had the scene mentioned a different religion, it would have been accepted. He also wrote, [...] "Given its famous flaunting of sleaze and death-defying motorcycle leaps, the big news here is that Fox has standards. Its latest production is Censors Who Kill Jokes." ...|$|E

500|$|James Panero, {{reviewer}} for The New York Times, called Street Gang a [...] "behind {{the lens}} story" [...] and the [...] "first comprehensive account" [...] of Sesame Street. [...] Panero found Davis' history tireless, but objected to Davis' emphasis on unimportant details. [...] As a result, {{and due to}} Davis' inclusion of every anecdote and biography of everyone involved with its creation and history, Panero considers the book an oral history rather than a tightly organized narrative. [...] Other reviewers note that Street Gang is too much like its subject, episodic and unfocused. [...] Diana Wagman of The L.A. Times states that Davis choice of what to focus on is odd; for example, {{there is a great}} deal of focus in the book on things like the licensing and merchandising agreement of the Muppets, but very little attention on Mississippi's 1970 ban of the show. [...] Wagman states, [...] "Yes, we get a little past-tense womanizing, a lot of drinking and a psychotic breakdown later in the book, but it <b>all</b> <b>seems</b> sad, not salacious, and not germane to the basic story". [...] Nick Gillespie of The Washington Post agrees. [...] He calls Jim Henson, who is mentioned often in the book, [...] "an almost completely enigmatic character".|$|E
500|$|The Edge of Glory was {{met with}} general acclaim from critics. While {{previewing}} the song Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone wrote a positive review: [...] "This one sounds crazy in print , but somehow it <b>all</b> <b>seems</b> totally natural when you actually hear it." [...] Perpetua added {{that there is an}} element of cheesiness in the song, but nevertheless, it is captivating and catchy when one listens to it. He complimented the inclusion of Clemons as an [...] "inspired touch that amplifies the song's Eighties stadium rock vibe," [...] and Clemons' actual performance was described as amazing and among the best of his career. In another review, Perpetua noted that [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] is [...] "an immediate pop anthem". Fellow Rolling Stone journalist Jody Rosen complimented the hook, the chorus and Clemens' saxophone playing on the song. Jocelyn Vena from MTV News asserted that the song showed a softer side to Gaga, as opposed to her previous singles from Born This Way. Willa Paskin from New York was impressed with the track, saying: [...] "If the first two tracks off the forthcoming Born This Way were all jangly dance-rock, this is as smooth as an '80s jam straight off the Flashdance soundtrack, and it has the saxophone breakdown to prove it." [...] Paskin also believed that the song had potential to be a summer hit, but could face competition from singer Katy Perry's single, [...] "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)".|$|E
500|$|Mars first {{performed}} the song live on Saturday Night Live on October 20, 2012. His performance was well received by critics. Rolling Stone magazine wrote, [...] "With a little oomph, a whole lotta shimmy-shimmy-ya {{and a few}} hip swivels, Bruno's ska-bop jam was given new life. It <b>all</b> <b>seems</b> so effortless; so cool and fresh; pop performances don't often fall ahead of the curve, but this one does." [...] Sam Lansky of Idolator praised the performance, writing that [...] "Mars turned {{it out on the}} show, with an energetic rendition of 'Locked Out of Heaven' backed by a fleet of impeccably choreographed dancers." [...] A live performance was also done on The X Factor UK, on November 25, 2012. On December 4, Mars performed on the [...] Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, aired on CBS. His performance happened during the Calendar Girls. On the December 8, 2012, Mars performed in the 2012 edition of Jingle Bell Ball at The O2 Arena in London.
