This paper argues that all these techniques and more were important, but that their weight varied dramatically across quite distinct campaign phases. The conclusions include that effective counter-insurgency analysis must integrate cognition of such phases (there must be different 'lessons' for different phases); and that in the Malayan case rapid build-up of barely trained local as well as extraneous forces, and the achievement of area and population security, were key to turning around the campaign in the most intense phase. While persuasive techniques were always present, 'winning hearts' came to the fore more in the later optimisation phase...|$|R

40|$|Party group leaders {{seemingly}} use {{a variety}} of disciplinary measures to <b>achieve</b> <b>unified</b> voting behavior in party groups. However, there is little systematic knowledge about the nature of such disciplinary measures and the interaction between leaders and group members remains a black box. Most studies of party voting concentrate on institutional variables such as electoral systems and take disciplinary measures as a given. This study presents a new way to measure party discipline, based on data from semi-structured interviews with 76 party group leaders and experts from five European parliaments. The discipline index provided here is the first to consider in a systematic way the means available to reprimand or reward party group members. In a second step, the study shows that disciplinary measures can compensate for a leader’s lack of control over candidate selection processes, and relate to group composition or size...|$|R
40|$|The logical {{approach}} to specification {{has been successfully}} used to exploit the foundations of software development in terms of theory manipulations, employing the formalism of many-sorted first order logic. When dealing with pragmatic applications though, and especially when mechanical support for refinement is considered, it seems necessary to augment this approach with features that ease the specification, reasoning and manipulation of complex entities. We demonstrate an incremental augmentation of logical specifications in the following steps: First we establish an explicit, syntactic representation of the truth values and <b>achieve</b> <b>unifying</b> format for all signature symbols.

This article discusses two related questions in this setting. First, we propose statistical tests {{to evaluate the}} quality of p-value and the cross-batch comparability of any other statistic. Second, we propose a lasso based variable selection statistic, based on when the predictor variable first becomes active, and compute its p-value to <b>achieve</b> <b>unified</b> FDR control across multiple selections. In the end, we apply our tests on covTest, selectiveInference, and our statistic, based on real and null datasets for network inference in normal and high-dimensional settings. Results demonstrate higher p-value quality from our statistic and reveal p-value errors from others hidden before. We implement our statistic as lassopv in R.

40|$|The central {{thesis of}} this essay is {{that the problem of}} {{psychology}} lies {{at the very heart of}} the difficulties associated with integrating human knowledge. The startling consequence of this insight is that it means the solution to psychology’s epistemological woes opens up a new pathway for <b>achieving</b> <b>unified</b> knowledge. A brief overview of the fragmentation of knowledge will be offered and special attention will be paid to Wilson’s (1998) proposal. The problem of psychology, Wilson’s failure to address it, and the reasons why it is integral to any proposal for unifying knowledge will then be specified. The article concludes with an articulation of how the Tree of Knowledge (ToK) System solves the problem of psychology, resolves many of the fundamental issues associated with integrating human knowledge, and is commensurate with the foremost concerns of natural scientists, social scientists and humanists, allowing for objectivity, coherence, and pluralism...|$|R
