5|$|The {{document}} was {{signed and dated}} at Boulogne on the 31 January 1308. At {{the top of the}} list of signatories was Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham and Patriarch of Jerusalem. He was followed by the four earls Lincoln, Pembroke, Surrey and Hereford, and five men of baronial families: Clifford, Payn Tybetot, Henry de Gray, John de Botetourt and John de Berwick. The document today exists in the Bodleian Library in Oxford, as <b>a</b> <b>transcript</b> made by the 17th-century antiquarian William Dugdale. Dugdale's transcript is believed to be based on an older document, which was probably lost in the Cotton library fire of 1731.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century Western {{scholars}} {{became aware}} of the manuscript {{as a consequence of the}} correspondence between Erasmus and the prefects of the Vatican Library, successively Paulus Bombasius, and Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda. In 1521, Bombasius was consulted by Erasmus as to whether the Codex Vaticanus contained the Comma Johanneum, and Bombasius supplied <b>a</b> <b>transcript</b> of 1 John 4:1–3 and 1 John 5:7–11 to show that it did not. Sepúlveda in 1533 cross-checked all places where Erasmus's New Testament (the Textus Receptus) differed from the Vulgate, and supplied Erasmus with 365 readings where the Codex Vaticanus supported the latter, although the list of these 365 readings has been lost. Consequently, the Codex Vaticanus acquired the reputation of being an old Greek manuscript that agreed with the Vulgate rather than with the Textus Receptus. Not until much later would scholars realise it conformed to a text that differed from both the Vulgate and the Textus Receptus – a text that could also be found in other known early Greek manuscripts, such as the Codex Regius (L), housed in the French Royal Library (now Bibliothèque nationale de France).|$|E
5|$|The Croatian {{government}} was criticised for {{its approach to}} the battle. Surviving defenders and right-wing political parties accused it of betrayal and of deliberately sacrificing Vukovar to secure international recognition for Croatia. The only explanation that many people were willing to accept for the town's fall was {{that it had been}} given up as part of a conspiracy. The commanders of the Croatian forces in Vukovar, Mile Dedaković and Branko Borković, both survived the battle and spoke out publicly against the government's actions. In an apparent attempt to silence them, both men were briefly detained by Croatian military police, and the Croatian government suppressed an issue of the newspaper Slobodni tjednik that published <b>a</b> <b>transcript</b> of a telephone call from Vukovar, in which Dedaković had pleaded with an evasive Tuđman for military assistance. The revelations caused public outrage and reinforced perceptions that the defenders had been betrayed.|$|E

We show here by in situ hybridization that E 2 <b>A</b> <b>transcripts</b> are present in most embryonic and adult tissues. However, no E 2 A expression is detectable in heart and nonproliferative regions of the brain and spinal cord. Highest levels of E 2 A expression are found in the ependyma cell layer surrounding the cerebral ventricles in the embryonic rat brain. In addition, in the embryo, E 2 <b>A</b> <b>transcripts</b> were found in secretory cells of the pancreas, the bronchial tubes of the lung, glomeruli of the kidney, and the lining of the stomach. Interestingly, high levels of E 2 <b>A</b> <b>transcripts</b> are selectively found in the germinal center of the lymphatic nodules in the adult rat spleen. Thus, E 2 A, like its Drosophila homolog daughterless, is expressed in most tissues.

5|$|In 1707 a deed {{was found}} among the ancient files of York County, Maine, near where Wheelwright had brought his flock to settle in Wells. The deed, dated 17 May 1629, showed Wheelwright as being one of several {{recipients}} of land from the Indian sagamores of southern New Hampshire, and a signer of the document. The deed thus implied that Wheelwright was present in New England in 1629, {{even though he was}} known to be the vicar of Bilsby in Lincolnshire at the time. While many historians declared the deed to be a forgery, Charles H. Bell, in his biography of Wheelwright in 1876, presented the case that the deed could be legitimate. It was known that as the vicar of Bilsby, Wheelwright was required to send <b>a</b> <b>transcript</b> of the parish registers to a central repository once a year, and this was done in March. However, of the several transcripts found with Wheelwright's signature attached, the one for March 1629 could not be found, leaving the door wide open to the possibility that Wheelwright had come to New England during this time frame and then returned to England. Sometime after Bell published his book on Wheelwright, the missing transcript was found, proving almost conclusively that Wheelwright had never left England during his ministry at Bilsby, and demonstrating with certainty that the deed of 1629 was a forgery. Sometime before his death, Governor Bell acknowledged the sequence of events and that the deed was an ingenious fabrication, and stated this in an undated letter to the New England Historical and Genealogical Society.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Pax 6 gene plays several {{roles in}} retinal development, {{including}} control of cell proliferation, {{maintenance of the}} retinogenic potential of progenitor cells, and cell fate specification. Emerging evidence suggests that these different aspects of Pax 6 gene function are mediated by different isoforms of the Pax 6 protein; however, relatively {{little is known about}} the spatiotemporal expression of Pax 6 isoforms in the vertebrate retina. Using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) technology, we modified a zebrafish Pax 6 a BAC such that we could distinguish paired-containing Pax 6 <b>a</b> <b>transcripts</b> from paired-less Pax 6 <b>a</b> <b>transcripts.</b> In the zebrafish, the spatial and temporal onset of expression of these transcripts suggests that the paired-less isoform is involved in the cell fate decision leading to the generation of amacrine cells; however, because of limitations associated with transient transgenic analysis, it was not feasible to establish whether this promoter was active in all amacrine cells or in a specific population of amacrine cells. By making mice transgenic for the zebrafish Pax 6 a BAC reporter transgene, we were able to show that paired-containing and paired-less Pax 6 <b>a</b> <b>transcripts</b> were differentially expressed in amacrine subpopulations. Our study also directly demonstrates the functional conservation of the regulatory mechanisms governing Pax 6 transcription in teleosts and mammals...|$|R

40|$|The Vibrio vulnificus putAP genes {{encoding}} a proline dehydrogenase and a proline permease are transcribed in {{the same}} direction. Proline dehydrogenase activity {{and the level of}} putA transcript were determined to reach a maximum in exponential phase and were then repressed when growth slowed down. Northern blotting and primer extension analyses revealed that transcription of putAP genes results in two different <b>transcripts,</b> <b>transcript</b> <b>A</b> (putA <b>transcript)</b> and transcript AP (putAP transcript). Expression of putAP genes was directed by two promoters, promoter PputA and promoter PputAP. A crp null mutation decreased proline dehydrogenase activity and the level of the put transcripts, indicating that transcription of putAP is under the positive control of cyclic AMP receptor protein. Proline dehydrogenase and the level of both put transcripts were increased by proline but repressed by glutamate. In contrast, the level of <b>transcript</b> <b>A,</b> not <b>transcript</b> AP, increased when proline dehydrogenase was induced by NaCl. Since PputA activity, not PputAP activity, was increased by NaCl, it is apparent that <b>transcript</b> <b>A</b> and <b>transcript</b> AP are transcribed through PputA and PputAP, respectively. Cells challenged with NaCl and various hyperosmotic stresses accumulated higher levels of glutamate than control cells, indicating that glutamate is a compatible solute in V. vulnificus...|$|R
40|$|Utrophin {{levels have}} {{recently}} {{been shown to be}} more abundant in slow vs. fast muscles, but the nature of the molecular events underlying this difference remains to be fully elucidated. Here, we determined whether this difference is due to the expression of utrophin A or B, and examined whether transcriptional regulatory mechanisms are also involved. Immunofluorescence experiments revealed that slower fibers contain significantly more utrophin A in extrasynaptic regions as compared with fast fibers. Single-fiber RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that expression of utrophin <b>A</b> <b>transcripts</b> correlates with the oxidative capacity of muscle fibers, with cells expressing myosin heavy chain I and IIa demonstrating the highest levels. Functional muscle overload, which stimulates expression of a slower, more oxidative phenotype, induced a significant increase in utrophin A mRNA levels. Because calcineurin has been implicated in controlling this slower, high oxidative myofiber program, we examined expression of utrophin <b>A</b> <b>transcripts</b> in muscles having altered calcineurin activity. Calcineurin inhibition resulted in an 80 % decrease in utrophin A mRNA levels. Conversely, muscles from transgenic mice expressing an active form of calcineurin displayed higher levels of utrophin <b>A</b> <b>transcripts.</b> Electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays revealed the presence of a nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) binding site in the utrophin A promoter. Transfection and direct gene transfer studies showed that active forms of calcineurin or nuclear NFATc 1 transactivate the utrophin A promoter. Together, these results indicate that expression of utrophin A is related to the oxidative capacity of muscle fibers, and implicate calcineurin and its effector NFAT in this mechanism...|$|R
