5|$|Berkelium forms a {{trigonal}} (η5–C5H5)3Bk metallocene complex {{with three}} cyclopentadienyl rings, {{which can be}} synthesized by reacting berkelium(III) chloride with the molten beryllocene (Be(C5H5)2) at about 70 °C. It has an amber color and a density of 2.47 g/cm3. The complex is stable to heating to at least 250 °C, and sublimates without melting at about 350 °C. The high radioactivity of berkelium gradually destroys the compound (within a period of weeks). One cyclopentadienyl ring in (η5–C5H5)3Bk can be substituted by chlorine to yield 2. The optical <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> of this compound {{are very similar to}} those of (η5–C5H5)3Bk.|$|E
5|$|Both NAD and NADH {{strongly}} absorb {{ultraviolet light}} {{because of the}} adenine. For example, peak absorption of NAD is at a wavelength of 259nanometers (nm), with an extinction coefficient of 16,900M−1cm−1. NADH also absorbs at higher wavelengths, with a second peak in UV absorption at 339nm with an extinction coefficient of 6,220M−1cm−1. This difference in the ultraviolet <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> between the oxidized and reduced forms of the coenzymes at higher wavelengths makes it simple to measure the conversion of one to another in enzyme assays– by measuring the amount of UV absorption at 340nm using a spectrophotometer.|$|E
5|$|The {{planetary}} {{model of}} the atom had two significant shortcomings. The first is that, unlike planets orbiting a sun, electrons are charged particles. An accelerating electric charge is known to emit electromagnetic waves according to the Larmor formula in classical electromagnetism. An orbiting charge should steadily lose energy and spiral toward the nucleus, colliding with it in {{a small fraction of}} a second. The second problem was that the planetary model could not explain the highly peaked emission and <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> of atoms that were observed.|$|E
50|$|The {{scattering}} {{and reflection}} spectra of a material {{are influenced by}} both its index of refraction and its <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrum.</b> In an optical context, the <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrum</b> is typically quantified by the extinction coefficient, and the extinction and index coefficients are quantitatively related through the Kramers-Kronig relation. Therefore, the <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrum</b> {{can be derived from}} a scattering or reflection spectrum. This typically requires simplifying assumptions or models, and so the derived <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrum</b> is an approximation.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrum</b> of a laser driven V {{system in which}} one of the upper levels is metastable. If the Rabi frequency of the laser driving the metastable transition is sufficiently small we find an extremely narrow peak in the stationary <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrum</b> of a weak probe on the strong transition. We give analytical expressions approximating the stationary <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrum.</b> The <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrum</b> of a two-level system is investigated for the case where an upper limit for the time separation of successive emissions is given. The <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrum</b> then exhibits a delta function like peak and using this we then show that the origin of the narrow peak in the <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrum</b> {{can be traced back to}} electron shelving i. e. to the existence of light and dark periods in the resonance fluorescence emitted on the strong transition.

The alterations resulting from various thermal treatments, excessing the recommended temperatures namely 240 ºC on the emission and <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrums</b> has been investigated. The main peak of <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrum,</b> which {{is relevant to}} F centers, don’t exhibits any difference to the <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrum</b> of LiF:Mg,Ti, which in turn demonstrates the dominant function of F centers in formation of trap centers in both TL materials. The TL Material LiF:Mg,Cu,P is sensitive to the temperatures higher than 240 ºC and {{the results show that}} main peak of <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrum</b> shifts to lower wavelength with increasing the temperature to 400 ºC. Furthermore the investigation of TL sensitivity from LiF:P at temperatures above 240 ºC confirms the role of P impurity in sensitivity reduction from LiF:Mg,Cu,P at temperatures higher than 240 ºC...|$|R

5|$|Optical {{absorption}} {{in carbon}} nanotubes differs from absorption in conventional 3D materials by presence of sharp peaks (1D nanotubes) {{instead of an}} absorption threshold followed by an absorption increase (most 3D solids). Absorption in nanotubes originates from electronic transitions from the v2 to c2 (energy E22) or v1 to c1 (E11) levels, etc. The transitions are relatively sharp {{and can be used}} to identify nanotube types. Note that the sharpness deteriorates with increasing energy, and that many nanotubes have very similar E22 or E11 energies, and thus significant overlap occurs in <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra.</b> This overlap is avoided in photoluminescence mapping measurements (see below), which instead of a combination of overlapped transitions identifies individual (E22,E11) pairs.|$|E
5|$|Americium readily {{reacts with}} oxygen and dissolves well in acids. The most common {{oxidation}} state for americium is +3, in which americium compounds are rather stable against oxidation and reduction. In this sense, americium is chemically similar to most lanthanides. The trivalent americium forms insoluble fluoride, oxalate, iodate, hydroxide, phosphate and other salts. Other oxidation {{states have been}} observed between +2 and +7, which is the widest range among the actinide elements. Their color in aqueous solutions varies as follows: Am3+ (colorless to yellow-reddish), Am4+ (yellow-reddish), AmV; (yellow), AmVI (brown) and AmVII (dark green). All oxidation states have their characteristic optical <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra,</b> with a few sharp peaks in the visible and mid-infrared regions, and the position and intensity of these peaks can be converted into the concentrations of the corresponding oxidation states. For example, Am(III) has two sharp peaks at 504 and 811nm, Am(V) at 514 and 715nm, and Am(VI) at 666 and 992nm.|$|E

25|$|After Bohr's use of Einstein's {{explanation}} of the photoelectric effect to relate energy levels in atoms with the wavelength of emitted light, {{the connection between the}} structure of electrons in atoms and the emission and <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> of atoms became an increasingly useful tool in the understanding of electrons in atoms. The most prominent feature of emission and <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> (known experimentally since the middle of the 19th century), was that these atomic spectra contained discrete lines. The significance of the Bohr model was that it related the lines in emission and <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> to the energy differences between the orbits that electrons could take around an atom. This was, however, not achieved by Bohr through giving the electrons some kind of wave-like properties, since the idea that electrons could behave as matter waves was not suggested until eleven years later. Still, the Bohr model's use of quantized angular momenta and therefore quantized energy levels was a significant step towards the understanding of electrons in atoms, and also a significant step towards the development of quantum mechanics in suggesting that quantized restraints must account for all discontinuous energy levels and spectra in atoms.|$|E

25|$|In 1938, Bothe and Gentner {{published}} on the energy dependence of the nuclear photo-effect. This was the first clear evidence that nuclear <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> are accumulative and continuous, an effect known as the dipolar giant nuclear resonance. This was explained theoretically a decade later by physicists J. Hans D. Jensen, Helmut Steinwedel, Peter Jensen, Michael Goldhaber, and Edward Teller.|$|E

The <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrum</b> of this assay is determined {{with the help of}} a Shimadzu UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer. Two distinct bands each containing three peaks corresponding to first and second van Hove singularities in the density of states of the nanotubes were observed in the <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrum.</b> When a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) having a sequence complementary to probic DNA is added to the ssDNA-SWNT conjugates, hybridization takes place, which causes the red shift of <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrum</b> of nanotubes. On the other hand, when the DNA is noncomplementary, no shift in the <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrum</b> occurs since hybridization between the DNA and probe does not take place. The red shifting of the spectrum is considered to be due to change in the dielectric environment around nanotubes...|$|R

By using UV-visible absorption spectrophotometer, the <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrum</b> of soaps and hair oils were determined. The mean <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrum</b> was 218 nm.

25|$|Electron spin {{resonance}} (ESR) is {{a related}} technique in which transitions between electronic spin levels are detected rather than nuclear ones. The basic principles are similar but the instrumentation, data analysis, and detailed theory are significantly different. Moreover, {{there is a}} much smaller number of molecules and materials with unpaired electron spins that exhibit ESR (or electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)) absorption than those that have NMR <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra.</b> ESR has much higher sensitivity than NMR does.|$|E
25|$|Deoxygenated {{hemoglobin}} is {{the form}} of hemoglobin without the bound oxygen. The <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin differ. The oxyhemoglobin has significantly lower absorption of the 660nm wavelength than deoxyhemoglobin, while at 940nm its absorption is slightly higher. This difference {{is used for the}} measurement of the amount of oxygen in a patient's blood by an instrument called a pulse oximeter. This difference also accounts for the presentation of cyanosis, the blue to purplish color that tissues develop during hypoxia.|$|E
25|$|The {{wavelengths}} {{at which}} azobenzene isomerization occurs {{depends on the}} particular structure of each azo molecule, but they are typically grouped into three classes: the azobenzene-type molecules, the aminoazobenzenes, and the pseudo-stilbenes. These azos are yellow, orange, and red, respectively, owing to the subtle differences in their electronic <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra.</b> The compounds similar to the unsubstituted azobenzene exhibit a low-intensity n-π* absorption in the visible region, and a much higher intensity π-π* absorption in the ultraviolet. Azos that are ortho- or para-substituted with electron-donating groups (such as aminos), are classified as aminoazobenzenes, and tend to closely spaced n-π* and π-π* bands in the visible. The pseudo-stilbene class is characterized by substituting the 4 and 4' positions of the two azo rings with electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups (that is, the two {{opposite ends of the}} aromatic system are functionalized). The addition of this push-pull configuration results in a strongly asymmetric electron distribution, which modifies a host of optical properties. In particular, it shifts the <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> of the trans and the cis isomers, so that they effectively overlap. Thus, for these compounds a single wavelength of light in the visible region will induce both the forward and reverse isomerization. Under illumination, these molecules cycle between the two isomeric states.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{increasing}} concentration (10 - 7 - 2. 5 x 10 - 3 mol/g) of Erythrosin B (Ery B) in poly(vinyl alcohol) films on its visible <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrum</b> have been investigated. In a concentration range of 2 x 10 - 7 - 10 - 5 mol/g, no {{effects on the}} <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrum</b> are found. By contrast, within this concentration range, time-resolved fluorescence experiments (fluorescence and anisotropy decay) reveal the presence of energy transfer between Ery B molecules, followed by fluorescence at low concentrations and fluorescence quenching at higher concentrations. At a concentration of 5 x 10 - 5 mol/g, the <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrum</b> broadens {{as compared to the}} monomeric spectrum and fluorescence is almost completely quenched. A further increase of the concentration results in a blue shift of the <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrum.</b> Using molecular mechanics calculations, it is shown that the initial broadening can be ascribed to excitonic interactions between randomly oriented molecules, whereas the blue shift at higher concentrations {{can be explained by the}} formation of oligomeric structures. At concentrations of 2. 5 x 10 - 3 mol/g, the molecules are closely packed, resulting in a contribution at the red edge of the <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrum...</b>|$|R

25|$|As a physicist, Gibbs's primary area of {{interest}} was spectroscopy. At the time, this was the fairly new and exciting field of research in physics. Physicists investigated the emission and absorption of radiation, creating an understanding of atomic structure. The new theory of quantum mechanics attempted to explain phenomena at the atomic and subatomic level. Gibbs was the author or co-author of over forty research papers, on subjects such as the ultraviolet spectra of isoelectronic sequences, and the hyperfine structure of spectra. He determined the charge-to-mass ratio of the electron by studying the intervals between the H-alpha lines of hydrogen and deuterium, and investigated the <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> of organic compounds in solution.|$|E
25|$|Each cone {{of a bird}} or reptile {{contains}} a coloured oil droplet; these no longer exist in mammals. The droplets, which contain high concentrations of carotenoids, are placed so that light passes through them before reaching the visual pigment. They act as ﬁlters, removing some wavelengths and narrowing the <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> of the pigments. This reduces the response overlap between pigments and increases the number of colours that a bird can discern. Six types of cone oil droplets have been identified; five of these have carotenoid mixtures that absorb at different wavelengths and intensities, and the sixth type has no pigments. The cone pigments with the lowest maximal absorption peak, including those that are UV-sensitive, possess the 'clear' or 'transparent' type of oil droplets with little spectral tuning effect.|$|E
25|$|Just as a gun recoils when {{a bullet}} is fired, {{conservation}} of momentum requires a nucleus (such as in a gas) to recoil during emission or absorption of a gamma ray. If a nucleus at rest emits a gamma ray, {{the energy of}} the gamma ray is slightly less than the natural energy of the transition, but in order for a nucleus at rest to absorb a gamma ray, the gamma ray's energy must be slightly greater than the natural energy, because in both cases energy is lost to recoil. This means that nuclear resonance (emission and absorption of the same gamma ray by identical nuclei) is unobservable with free nuclei, because the shift in energy is too great and the emission and <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> have no significant overlap.|$|E

25|$|More bands {{provide more}} {{discrete}} information, or greater resolution. The characteristic emission and <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> serve to fingerprint or define {{the makeup of}} the feature that was observed. A radiometric plot represents the radiant intensity versus time; there can be plots at multiple bands or wavelengths. For each point along a time-intensity radiometric plot, a spectral plot can be generated {{based on the number of}} spectral bands in the collector, such as the radiant intensity plot of a missile exhaust plume as the missile is in flight. The intensity or brightness of the object is a function of several conditions including its temperature, surface properties or material, and how fast it is moving. Remember that additional, non-electro-optical sensors, such as ionizing radiation detectors, can correlate with these bands.|$|E
25|$|The next {{development}} in optical theory came in 1899 when Max Planck correctly modelled blackbody radiation by {{assuming that the}} exchange of energy between light and matter only occurred in discrete amounts he called quanta. In 1905 Albert Einstein published {{the theory of the}} photoelectric effect that firmly established the quantization of light itself. In 1913 Niels Bohr showed that atoms could only emit discrete amounts of energy, thus explaining the discrete lines seen in emission and <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra.</b> The understanding of the interaction between light and matter which followed from these developments not only formed the basis of quantum optics but also was crucial for the development of quantum mechanics as a whole. The ultimate culmination, the theory of quantum electrodynamics, explains all optics and electromagnetic processes in general {{as the result of the}} exchange of real and virtual photons.|$|E
25|$|Placement of {{the sample}} stage {{into one of the}} {{interferometer}}'s arms (instead of outside of the interferometer as typically implemented in conventional FTIR) is a key element of nano-FTIR. It boosts the weak near-field signal due to interference with the strong reference field, helps to eliminate completely the background caused by parasitic scattering off everything that falls into large diffraction-limited beam focus, and most importantly, allows for recording of both amplitude s and phase φ spectra of the tip-scattered radiation. With the detection of phase, nano-FTIR provides complete information about near fields, which is essential for quantitative studies and many other applications. For example, for soft matter samples (organics, polymers, biomaterials, etc.), φ directly relates to the absorption in the sample material. This permits a direct comparison of nano-FTIR spectra with conventional <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> {{of the sample}} material, thus allowing for simple spectroscopic identification according to standard FTIR databases.|$|E
