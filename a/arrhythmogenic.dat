25|$|On 12 April 2016, it was {{announced}} that Taylor had been forced to retire from cricket following the diagnosis of a serious heart condition called <b>arrhythmogenic</b> right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), that {{is similar to that of}} Fabrice Muamba.|$|E
25|$|Flecainide also {{inhibits}} ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2), a major regulator of sarcoplasmic {{release of}} stored calcium ions. It can reduce calcium sparks and thus <b>arrhythmogenic</b> calcium {{waves in the}} heart. While Flecainide therapy {{has been shown to}} suppress ventricular arrhythmias in patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and mouse models of this disease, the relative contribution from the inhibition of sodium channels and of RyR2 in this effect on CPVT is unclear.|$|E
25|$|James William Arthur Taylor (born 6 January 1990) is an English former cricketer {{who played}} for Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club. A {{right-handed}} batsman and occasional right-arm leg break bowler, Taylor made his debut in first-class cricket in 2008 for Leicestershire and made major impressions in his first county seasons. He is noted as being a fine fielder in the covers. He became the youngest Leicestershire one-day centurion and first-class double centurion. In 2009, Taylor also became the youngest player in Leicestershire's history to score 1,000 championship runs in a season. A serious heart condition, <b>arrhythmogenic</b> right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), forced him to retire in April 2016.|$|E
2500|$|It {{also has}} limited {{use in the}} {{treatment}} of certain forms of ventricular tachycardia (VT). [...] In particular, flecainide has been useful {{in the treatment of}} ventricular tachycardias that are not in the setting of an acute ischemic event. [...] It has use in the treatment of right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) tachycardia and in the suppression of arrhythmias in <b>arrhythmogenic</b> right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD). [...] Studies (notably the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial) have shown an increased mortality when flecainide is used to suppress ventricular extrasystoles in the setting of acute myocardial infarction.|$|E
2500|$|Cardiomyopathy, {{or disease}} of the heart muscle, is also seen in dogs and is {{associated}} with large breeds (the exception being Cocker Spaniels, a medium-sized breed). [...] Dilated cardiomyopathy is seen in Great Danes, Irish Wolfhounds, St. Bernards, Dobermanns, Boxers, and other large breeds. [...] Dobermanns, in addition to heart muscle failure, are prone to ventricular arrhythmias. [...] Boxer dogs are predisposed to a unique cardiomyopathy with clinical and histological changes analogous to human <b>arrhythmogenic</b> right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). The disease has been termed “Boxer cardiomyopathy” or “Boxer ARVC”, and is characterized by development of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Affected dogs {{are at risk of}} syncope and sudden cardiac death. Myocardial failure and congestive heart failure are rare manifestations of this disease.|$|E
2500|$|Leading {{health issues}} to which Boxers are prone include cancers, heart {{conditions}} such as aortic stenosis and <b>arrhythmogenic</b> right ventricular cardiomyopathy (the so-called [...] "Boxer cardiomyopathy"), hypothyroidism, hip dysplasia, and degenerative myelopathy and epilepsy; other conditions that may be seen are gastric dilatation volvulus (also known as bloat), intestinal problems, and allergies (although these may be more related to diet than breed). Entropion, a malformation of the eyelid requiring surgical correction, is occasionally seen, and some lines have a tendency toward spondylosis deformans, a fusing of the spine, or dystocia. Other conditions that are less common but occur more often in Boxers than other breeds are hystiocytic ulcerative colitis (sometimes called Boxer colitis), an invasive E. coli infection, and indolent corneal ulcers, often called Boxer eye ulcers.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, Cameroon {{international}} player Marc-Vivien Foé collapsed {{during a}} Confederations Cup match against Colombia and {{was pronounced dead}} later that day. His death was attributed to previously undiagnosed [...] heart problems. On 8 September 1990, York City F.C.'s David Longhurst collapsed and died on the pitch during his team's match with Lincoln City F.C.. The game was abandoned and York City paid tribute to the player later by naming a stand in his honour at their Bootham Crescent ground. In 2004, the Hungarian international Miklós Fehér died from a heart attack, while playing for Benfica against Vitória Guimarães. On 9 September 2006 Hinckley United F.C. player, Matt Gadsby, collapsed on the pitch and died during a Conference North game against Harrogate Town F.C.. Medical tests revealed he died from a heart condition known as <b>Arrhythmogenic</b> Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy. On 25 August 2007 Sevilla FC player, Antonio Puerta {{suffered a heart attack}} during Sevilla's first game of the season against Getafe whilst running back towards his own goal. Sevilla teammate Ivica Dragutinović as well as medical staff rushed to his aid. He was admitted to hospital and he died on 28 August aged 22. Several players have also been struck by lightning while playing during sudden storms.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the {{mechanistic}} role of beta-catenin in cardiac hypertrophy, {{transgenic mouse}} {{studies have shown}} somewhat conflicting results regarding whether upregulation of beta-catenin is beneficial or detrimental. A recent study using a conditional knockout mouse that either lacked beta-catenin altogether or expressed a non-degradable form of beta-catenin in cardiomyocytes reconciled a potential reason for these discrepancies. There appears to be strict control over the subcellular localization of beta-catenin in cardiac muscle. Mice lacking beta-catenin had no overt phenotype in the left ventricular myocardium; however, mice harboring a stabilized form of beta-catenin developed dilated cardiomyopathy, suggesting that the temporal regulation of beta-catenin by protein degradation mechanisms is critical for normal functioning of beta-catenin in cardiac cells. In a mouse model harboring knockout of a desmosomal protein, plakoglobin, implicated in <b>arrhythmogenic</b> right ventricular cardiomyopathy, the stabilization of beta-catenin was also enhanced, presumably {{to compensate for the}} loss of its plakogloblin homolog. These changes were coordinate with Akt activation and glycogen synthase kinase 3β inhibition, suggesting once again that the abnormal stabilization of beta-catenin may be involved in the development of cardiomyopathy. [...] Further studies employing a double knockout of plakoglobin and beta-catenin showed that the double knockout developed cardiomyopathy, fibrosis and arrhythmias resulting in sudden cardiac death. Intercalated disc architecture was severely impaired and connexin 43-resident gap junctions were markedly reduced. Electrocardiogram measurements captured spontaneous lethal ventricular arrhythmias in the double transgenic animals, suggesting that the two catenins—beta-catenin and plakoglobin are critical and idispensible for mechanoelectrical coupling in cardiomyocytes.|$|E

50|$|Mutations in PKP2 {{have been}} {{associated}} with, {{have been shown to}} cause, and are considered common in <b>arrhythmogenic</b> right ventricular cardiomyopathy, which is characterized by fibrofatty replacement of cardiomyocytes, ventricular tachycardia and sudden cardiac death. It is estimated that 70% of all mutations associated with <b>arrhythmogenic</b> right ventricular cardiomyopathy are within the PKP2 gene. These mutations in general appear to disrupt the assembly and stability of desmosomes. Mechanistic studies have shown that certain PKP2 mutations result in instability of the plakophilin-2 protein due to enhanced calpain-mediated degradation.|$|E
50|$|The Association for Inherited Cardiac Conditions is the UK National Professional {{body for}} experts in Genetics and Cardiology dealing with {{inherited}} {{diseases of the}} heart... These include heart muscle diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, noncompaction cardiomyopathy, and <b>arrhythmogenic</b> cardiomyopathy (also known as <b>arrhythmogenic</b> right ventricular dysplasia), as well as inherited arrhythmia disorders such as long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome. The AICC also represents experts in aortic disease such as Marfan Syndrome and other systemic diseases which affect the heart or circulation.|$|E
50|$|Clinical {{and genetic}} {{characterization}} of <b>arrhythmogenic</b> right ventricular cardiomyopathy is currently under intense investigation {{to understand the}} penetrance associated with PKP2 mutations, {{as well as other}} genes encoding desmosomal proteins, in disease progression and outcome.|$|E

50|$|Mutation of the JUP gene {{encoding}} plakoglobin {{has been}} implicated {{as one of}} the causes of the cardiomyopathy known as <b>arrhythmogenic</b> right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) or <b>arrhythmogenic</b> right ventricular cardiomyopathy; mutations in JUP specifically causes an autosomal recessive form referred to as Naxos disease. This form of was first identified in a small cluster of families on the Greek island of Naxos. The phenotype of the Naxos disease variant of ARVD is unique in that it involves the hair and skin as well as the right ventricle. Affected individuals have kinky, wooly hair; there is also palmar and plantar erythema at birth that progresses to keratosis as the palms and soles of the feet are used in crawling and walking. These findings co-segregate 100% with the development of ARVD by early adolescence.|$|E
50|$|Desmocollin-2 is {{a protein}} that in humans is encoded by the DSC2 gene.
