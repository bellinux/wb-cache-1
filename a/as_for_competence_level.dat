Specifically, {{regional and national}} features, together with current opportunities and challenges, are analyzed in detail, leading to frameworks for approaching such events without negatively impacting upon staff productivity and creativity. Specific behavioral codes and cultural heritage issues {{are taken into account}} in developing certain schemes <b>for</b> <b>competence</b> <b>levels</b> in multinational companies. A clearly delineated section is dedicated to the modalities in which the didactic process and professors as role models can contribute to the professional development of business students, by providing periodical favorable contexts for sharing best practice on this topic. Proficient leadership does not stem from chance or the right connections to get to the highest level of an organization, and has {{very little to do with}} opportunity. True leadership involves management and knowledge in the field, certain traits of character and temperament – role model assets, and hard work with vision. Effective leaders prove extensive life experience and the ability to focus their teams’ interests away from conflict and towards results, providing progress opportunities as well as constructive approaches.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the <b>level</b> of social <b>competence</b> on the {{performance}} of a paired discrimination task involving social censure cues for groups of hospitalized schizophrenics, alcoholics, and normals was investigated. Previous studies finding differences between process and reactive schizophrenics had not controlled <b>for</b> the social <b>competence</b> <b>level</b> of the normal controls. Twentyfour subjects from each diagnostic category were divided equally among groups of low, middle, and high social <b>competence</b> <b>levels.</b> Low social <b>competence</b> subjects discriminated maternal censure stimuli more poorly than middle or high socially competent groups. Psychiatric diagnosis had no significant effect on performance. The results do not support the social censure theory of schizophrenia and suggest that there has been confounding between social <b>competence</b> <b>level</b> and diagnosis in previous process-reactive research. The process-reactive distinction has been widely researched as a means of reducing the heterogeneity within the diagnostic category of schizophrenia. Feffer and Phillips (1953) stated that this dimension was basically a measure of adequacy of life adjustment, and they suggested that it might be meaningfully applied across all diagnostic categories.

40|$|Abstract: This chapter {{extends the}} use of {{cognitive}} and “situative ” theories of learning described in our earlier chapter to discuss the design of five chemistry multimedia visualization projects. All five projects are shown to enhance the learning of chemistry concepts and development of scientific investigative process skills. Two projects emphasize the social processes associated with scientific investigation with bench laboratory components; two others without laboratory components could be easily utilized in ways that develop such social processes; and the fifth is shown to enhance visualization process skills although it was designed based upon the cognitive theory of multimedia learning. In order to assess the developing levels of visualization skills of novice chemistry students supported by all five visualization projects, non-traditional testing items must be utilized. Samples of several multimedia testing items addressing both conceptual and process skills are discussed and used in studies of {{the efficacy of the}} most cognitive-theory based project.

40|$|The local {{politicians}} in Sweden {{are responsible for}} {{a great deal of}} the welfare system why one would assume that there are a lot of demands put on them - demands for certain skills or a certain <b>level</b> of <b>competence.</b> I have in this study tried to find out how the demands on the local representatives concerning the demands <b>for</b> <b>competence</b> and the actual <b>level</b> of <b>competence</b> among the politicians are affecting the local politics. This was done through investigating how the {{local politicians}} are perceiving their <b>level</b> of <b>competence</b> and the demands put on them, but also how the employees are perceiving the demands and the <b>level</b> of <b>competence</b> put on the politicians. The study was made in the municipality of Gislaved in Southern Sweden. I was using both quantitative method (an opinion poll among the politicians and employees in the municipality) and qualitative method (interviews with three politicians and three employees and literature studies). In order to investigate the demands <b>for</b> <b>competence</b> I split the concept into “soft” competence (socially and emotionally based skills), and “hard” competence (skills based on knowledge, education and experience). The demands <b>for</b> <b>competence</b> mentioned in the opinion-poll are both “soft” and “hard”: 62 % of the employees put demands of “hard” competence skills on the politicians. 61 % of the politicians put demands of “soft” competence skills on themselves. The interviewed respondents say that certain skills are needed for a certain political mission. I consider the demands <b>for</b> <b>competence</b> <b>as</b> rather high according to the result. The local politicians are not, according to the opinion-poll, having the appropriate competence skills, though many of the respondents (56) answered that they have the competence to a certain degree. It is also noticeable that 33 out of 81 persons say that the employees are only having the competence needed to a certain degree. I consider the <b>level</b> of <b>competence</b> among the local politicians rather low according to the result. The results from the investigations of the demands <b>for</b> <b>competence</b> and the <b>level</b> of <b>competence</b> were put into a model with different outcomes depending on if the <b>level</b> of <b>competence</b> and the demands <b>for</b> <b>competence</b> are high or low. The result from high demands <b>for</b> <b>competence</b> and a <b>level</b> of <b>competence</b> not answering fully to those demands is that these high demands of political skills may put a pressure on the politicians, which may lead to a higher <b>level</b> of <b>competence,</b> an increased quality on the local politics, create a higher degree of confidence in the politicians from the society and an increased interest in political participation, but the high demands could also lead to a feeling of incompetence among the politicians, and that less people will take interest in participating in politics as they wont consider themselves having the demanded skills. So increased demands of competence may lead to both quality and elitism. The non-existing demands of competence of today supports increased amateurism among the local decision makers, and an increase in the rule of experts. If a number of demands would be formalized they could on the other hand create barriers for marginalized groups participation in politics...|$|R

It {{is very important to}} adapt to not only today‘s circumstances and labor market, but to also predict what will happen tomorrow and even further in the future. Hence, competence of the leaders must be refined and stay dynamic at all times, depending on current and future trends.

Purposeful control of workers can be achieved by the models of competence, which aid in reaching organization‘s short and long term goals. Organizations use models of competence in order to stay competitive in market, as the system combines actions and results of both organization and workers to match each other‘s requirements.

This paper is based on studies together with regional and hospital authorities, but should be relevant for other types of existing buildings as well. The primary objectives of these studies are to implement requirements for fire safety, universal design, environmental regulations, status of maintenances, occupancy, daily operations, rebuilding, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing installations (MEP) and effective use of energy and space within the BIM model.
