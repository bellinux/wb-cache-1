They are possible shapes and frequencies of oscillation. In real conditions, only some of them are excited. Determination of ways (mechanisms) of excitation and conditions under which a modal shape will be excited is the central question of this paper. For the purpose of elaboration of procedure and conditions of excitement, i. e. for the purpose of defining rules of excitation, we have used the results of modal analysis by applying FEM, by using the method of direct integration within FEM and results of modal testing. The subject of analysis and examination is <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> <b>housing.</b> Modal activity of housing walls is in direct relation with structure and intensity of noise emitted by the gearbox into the environment.

40|$|Copyright c © 2007 SAE International The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to extend the acous-tic {{boundary}} element analysis to the high frequency regime. At higher frequencies, the surface boundary element mesh of the radiator must be sufficiently fine to capture the rapid spatial variations of the sound field. Traditional BEM implementations have had dif-ficulty in dealing with large number of unknown vari-ables and thus are limited to low frequency analysis of small bodies. In a typical boundary element analy-sis, computation of the coefficient matrix constitutes a major portion of the total analysis time and total mem-ory usage. The key to obtaining rapid solutions of large problems using BEM is to completely bypass the coefficient ma-trix computation. We have developed a new Direct Boundary Element Variational formulation that is used in conjunction with iterative solvers from the Krylov family, and a new Multilevel Fast Multipole Method (MLFMM) that facilitates extremely fast matrix-vector product computation. This approach overcomes the limitations of traditional BEM and allows us to per-form fast NVH analysis of large problems in the mid-high frequency regime. We demonstrate the accuracy of our predictions by comparing with several closed form analytical solutions.

50|$|Owned by the Canal & River Trust, the {{reservoir}} was constructed around 1833 {{to feed the}} Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal, which {{became part of the}} Shropshire Union Canal in 1846. Work began on it in 1832, and the canal opened in early 1835. Traffic levels were high, and the company had to buy 2,000 lockfulls of water in the first year, for which they paid £800 to the Wyrley and Essington Canal. In 1836, there was still pressure on the water supply, and the engineer William Cubitt was instructed to enlarge {{the reservoir}} in May. In order to finance the improvements, the Commissioners agreed {{that they would not be}} paid until £20,000 had been spent on the improvements. The enlarged reservoir was completed in 1842.

The reservoir is fed by a tributary of the River Penk.|$|R

A commercial external spur gear pump which has 17. 1 [L min- 1] volumetric flow rate with maximum pressure capacity of 250 [bar] has been considered for {{an application}} case study. In the experimental section of the study, four pressure sensors (emitters) were placed with angle intervals of 45 °, 90 °, 135 ° and 180 ° on the pump’s housing to measure operating pressure values at specific pressure regions of the housing from inlet to outlet. According to experimental results of the pressure measurements, a response surface analysis (RSA) was carried out and then an estimation model (empirical equation), {{which could be used}} to calculate pressure values at any specific region of the housing, was obtained. According to the RSA results gained, it appears that the estimation model has 99. 9 % R 2 value which can be used for adequately predicting accurate pressures at any region of the housing. Subsequently, this estimation model has been adapted for commercial finite element method (FEM) based engineering software and from which stress distributions on the housing were simulated three dimensionally. FEM based simulation outputs showed that there were no failure signatures on the pump housing. As the main conclusion of the study, it is seen that an estimation model gives an adequate approach to predict pressure values at any specific pressure region of the pump housing and, especially, stress distribution results has highlighted that a structural optimisation study may be suitable for the pump housing...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} the result of a thesis work in mechanichal {{engineering}} performed at Volvo GroupTrucks Operations, Powertrain productions in Köping by the student Christoffer Jansson. Thework of 15 ECTS credits is conducted over a 20 week period at half speed equivalent to 400 working hours. The background to the work is the desire to improve a workstation where the transmissions tothe IPS 2 / 3 and IPS 15 are assembled. The problem on the workstation is that the workers areperforming non value-added activities (NVAA) and it is of interest that one would examine thepossibility of how to squeeze two bearing rings in the same sequence. The aim is thus todevelop a suggestion of improvement for the bearing pressing method on the assembly line. The issue the thesis work is based on is: How does one manage to press together two bearingrings in the same sequence into a particular component? & How can one improve theergonomic circumstances on the workstation?To be able to perform this work, a case study based on the product development processaccording to Ulrich and Eppinger (2012) has been made. Product development tools are used tofacilitate the work of the student. Including Gantt chart, Pugh's analysis and functional analysis. The result of the work is a modification of the existing working table where the bearing ringsare pressed into the middle <b>gear</b> <b>housing.</b> The solution consists of a steel plate that rests on fivesprings which dampen the weight of the middle <b>gear</b> <b>housing.</b> The middle <b>gear</b> <b>housing</b> is thecomponent in which the bearing rings are pressed in.

These guiding rods are in turn controlled bybushings which serve to reduce friction. The bushings are standard components that aremounted into a component called the bushing holder, which is a component that is screwed intothe table. The new working process the solution provides eliminates the previous NVAA that has been onthe station before and allows the worker to press two bearing rings into the middle gearinghouse in the same sequence. The ergonomic circumstances have also been improved due to theelimination of the worker having to rotate the heavy middle <b>gearing</b> <b>house</b> 180 degrees.
