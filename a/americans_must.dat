[...] He also said that <b>Americans</b> <b>must</b> not submit to acts of tyranny [...] "till custom and use shall make us as tame and abject slaves, as the blacks we rule over with such arbitrary sway." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{stereotyping}} of Native <b>Americans</b> <b>must</b> {{be understood}} {{in the context of}} history which includes conquest, forced relocation, and organized efforts to eradicate native cultures, such as the boarding schools of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which separated young Native Americans from their families in order to educate them as European Americans. As stated in an editorial by Carter Meland (Anishinaabe heritage) and David E. Wilkins (Lumbee) both professors of American Indian Studies at the University of Minnesota: [...] "Since the first Europeans made landfall in North America, native peoples have suffered under a weltering array of stereotypes, misconceptions and caricatures. Whether portrayed as noble savages, ignoble savages, teary-eyed environmentalists or, most recently, simply as casino-rich, native peoples find their efforts to be treated with a measure of respect and integrity undermined by images that flatten complex tribal, historical and personal experience into one-dimensional representations that tells us more about the depicters than about the depicted." ...|$|E
500|$|The British {{government}} {{also came to}} the conclusion that colonists and Native <b>Americans</b> <b>must</b> be kept apart. On October 7, 1763, the Crown issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763, an effort to reorganize British North America after the Treaty of Paris. The Proclamation, already in the works when Pontiac's War erupted, was hurriedly issued after news of the uprising reached London. Officials drew a boundary line between the British colonies along the seaboard, and Native American lands west of the Allegheny Ridge (i.e., the Eastern Divide), creating a vast 'Indian Reserve' that stretched from the Alleghenies to the Mississippi River and from Florida to Quebec. It thus confirmed the antebellum demarcation that had been set by the Treaty of Easton in 1758. By forbidding colonists from trespassing on Native lands, the British government hoped to avoid more conflicts like Pontiac's Rebellion. [...] "The Royal Proclamation," [...] writes historian Colin Calloway, [...] "reflected the notion that segregation not interaction should characterize Indian-white relations." ...|$|E
500|$|Coolidge himself later said, [...] "No {{doubt it}} was the police strike in Boston that brought me into {{national}} prominence." [...] In a post-election congratulatory telegram President Wilson wrote: [...] "I congratulate you upon your election as a victory for law and order. When that is the issue, all <b>Americans</b> <b>must</b> stand together." [...] His role in the strike, however limited, became a prominent feature of his resume as he sought higher office. According to one obituary, [...] "the Boston police strike of 1919 ... brought him national prominence and the nomination for the Vice Presidency" [...] in 1920. When he succeeded to the presidency in 1923 upon the death of Warren Harding, the New York Times headlined its biography: [...] "Coolidge Firmness Won Recognition; His Suppression of the Boston Police Strike Made Him a National Figure". Coolidge's political rivals interpreted his role differently. In 1925, U.S. Senator Robert La Follette of Wisconsin said that Coolidge's failure to intervene in that year's coal strike mirrored his 1919 actions when he [...] "persistently refused to act upon the requests of the Mayor of Boston for assistance until riot and bloodshed had aroused the entire State. Then when order had been restored by the efforts of Mayor Peters and the Storrow committee Coolidge sent in the militia and claimed full credit for restoring 'law and order'." ...|$|E

2500|$|Given the {{differences}} in facilities and intangibles, such as {{the distance of the}} new school from Austin, the University of Texas School of Law, and other law students, the United States Supreme Court ruled the new facility did not satisfy [...] "separate but equal" [...] provisions.

This was very wrong and foolish, considering that I was one of the sovereigns; but a sovereign, or any number of sovereigns, or the twenty-millionth part of a sovereign, does not love to find himself, as an <b>American</b> <b>must,</b> included within the delegated authority of his own servants.|$|R

2500|$|Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said, [...] "I {{applaud the}} Supreme Court's {{decision}} {{to protect the}} religious freedom of all Americans, both individually and collectively. The notion that religious freedom belongs only to some, and even then only in private, defies our nation's traditions, our laws, and our Constitution. And as the Supreme Court rightfully said today, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act {{could not have been}} clearer in saying religious liberty of all <b>Americans</b> <b>must</b> be equally protected and not unnecessarily burdened." ...|$|E
2500|$|Conversely, President Bush {{argued that}} the unrest was [...] "purely criminal". Though he {{acknowledged}} that the King verdicts were plainly unjust, he maintained that [...] "we simply cannot condone violence {{as a way of}} changing the system ... Mob brutality, the total loss of respect for human life was sickeningly sad ... What we saw last night and the night before in Los Angeles is not about civil rights. It's not about the great cause of equality that all <b>Americans</b> <b>must</b> uphold. It's not a message of protest. It's been the brutality of a mob, pure and simple." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{example of}} his outspoken {{political}} action came when he concluded an old-time radio episode of The Saint, entitled [...] "Author of Murder," [...] which aired on NBC Radio on July 30th, 1950. He denounced racial and religious prejudice {{as a form of}} poison and claimed <b>Americans</b> <b>must</b> actively fight against it because racial and religious prejudice within the United States fuels support for the nation's enemies. Price was later appointed to the Indian Arts and Crafts Board under the Dwight D. Eisenhower Administration; he called the appointment [...] "kind of a surprise, since I am a Democrat." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prior to his {{pilgrimage to}} Mecca, Malcolm X {{believed}} that African <b>Americans</b> <b>must</b> {{develop their own}} society and ethical values, including the self-help, community-based enterprises, that the black Muslims supported. He also thought that African Americans should reject integration or cooperation with whites until they could achieve internal cooperation and unity. He prophetically believed that there [...] "would be bloodshed" [...] if the racism problem in America remained ignored, and he renounced [...] "compromise" [...] with whites. In April 1964, Malcolm X participated in a Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca); Malcolm found himself restructuring his views and recanted several extremist opinions during his shift to mainstream Islam.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{influential}} African American {{of the nineteenth}} century, Douglass {{made a career of}} agitating the American conscience. He spoke and wrote on behalf of a variety of reform causes: women's rights, temperance, peace, land reform, free public education, and the abolition of capital punishment. But he devoted the bulk of his time, immense talent, and boundless energy to ending slavery and gaining equal rights for African Americans. These were the central concerns of his long reform career. Douglass understood that the struggle for emancipation and equality demanded forceful, persistent, and unyielding agitation. And he recognized that African <b>Americans</b> <b>must</b> play a conspicuous role in that struggle. Less than a month before his death, when a young black man solicited his advice to an African American just starting out in the world, Douglass replied without hesitation: [...] "Agitate! Agitate! Agitate!" ...|$|E
