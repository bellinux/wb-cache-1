5|$|A {{major part}} of modern weather {{forecasting}} is the severe weather alerts and <b>advisories</b> that the national weather services issue in the case that severe or hazardous weather is expected. This is done to protect life and property. Some {{of the most commonly}} known of severe weather <b>advisories</b> are the severe thunderstorm and tornado warning, as well as the severe thunderstorm and tornado watch. Other forms of these <b>advisories</b> include winter weather, high wind, flood, tropical cyclone, and fog. Severe weather <b>advisories</b> and alerts are broadcast through the media, including radio, using emergency systems as the Emergency Alert System, which break into regular programming.|$|E

Also, small craft <b>advisories</b> were in effect for Maui and Hawaii; wind <b>advisories</b> were issued for summits in those regions. High surf <b>advisories</b> were also put into effect for coastal areas. The Hawaii County Civil Defense prepared for the storm by planning for increases in emergency response personnel and opening of evacuation centers.

5|$|The first {{system of}} the season proper {{originated}} out of an area of convection in early September in the northeast portion of the basin. On September3, the MFR initiated <b>advisories</b> on Tropical Disturbance A1 about 1435km (890mi) east of Diego Garcia. The system tracked westward, and the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on September4. Failing to intensify beyond winds of 45km/h (30mph), the disturbance dissipated on September6. Later in the month, Tropical Disturbance A2 formed in a similar region within the monsoon trough, with the MFR initiating <b>advisories</b> on September29. Also on that day, the JTWC began issuing <b>advisories</b> on Tropical Cyclone 02S. That day, the JTWC upgraded the system to tropical storm status, although strong wind shear prevented intensification. The MFR quickly discontinued <b>advisories,</b> but the JTWC continued tracking it, again upgrading the system to tropical storm status on October1. After the shear again increased, the storm weakened, dissipating on October2.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{initiating}} <b>advisories</b> on Hattie, the Miami Weather Bureau {{noted the}} potential for heavy rainfall and flash flooding in the southwestern Caribbean.

5|$|On January3, the BoM and the JTWC ceased issuing <b>advisories</b> on Tropical Cyclone Phil in the Australian region, which {{previously}} {{moved over}} Western Australia. The system continued to the west, entering the south-west Indian Ocean on January5. On January8, {{the remnants of}} Phil slowed {{and turned to the}} southeast. The next day, the JTWC began reissuing <b>advisories</b> on Phil. The storm meandered and executed a small loop, and in the process reached peak 1minute winds of 85km/h (50mph). Phil turned back to the southwest, and the JTWC ceased issuing <b>advisories</b> on January12. Four days later, the circulation dissipated. Also in January, the JTWC briefly tracked Tropical Cyclone 18S from the Australian region, which entered the south-west Indian Ocean on January12. At that time, the storm had peak 1minute winds of 85km/h (50mph), although it quickly weakened and dissipated on January13.|$|E

40|$|<b>Advisory</b> {{committees}} are important liaisons between colleges and their communities. If a college is truly interested in serving its community, it should utilize <b>advisory</b> committees to advise it {{on matters of}} curriculum planning. Following a detailed discussion of the various aspects of <b>advisory</b> committee selection and functioning, the author recommends the following: (1) that more boards and/or presidents {{be made aware of}} the positive effects of <b>advisory</b> committees; (2) student participation in the operation of <b>advisory</b> committees; (3) inservice training for administrators and faculty in the intricacies of initiating and operating <b>advisory</b> committees; (4) more recognition of <b>advisory</b> committee members; (5) the institution of General <b>Advisory</b> Committees as well as Occupational <b>Advisory</b> Committees; (6) automatic board approval of administrator or faculty-selected <b>advisory</b> committee nominees; (7) that <b>advisory</b> committees provide suggestions for the implementation of any recommendation for action they submit; (8) <b>advisory</b> committee self-evaluation and college-sponsored training in group procedures if the committee feels the need for it; (9) that <b>advisory</b> committees focus their attention on students as well as college and community; and (10) that <b>advisory</b> committees evaluate the product of the program as well as the program itself.

5|$|An area of {{convection}} {{formed on}} November9 {{to the east}} of Diego Garcia, possibly the result of the MJO. A circulation was evident by November11, and the following day it developed into Tropical Disturbance 2 about 830km (515mi) southeast of Diego Garcia. Also on November12, the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 02S. It moved to the southwest, but looped back to the east on November13, during which time the MFR upgraded it to tropical depression status. Later that day, the agency ceased issuing <b>advisories,</b> but the system reorganized on November14.

5|$|As Gladys {{strengthened}} in the Atlantic Ocean, forecasters at the United State Weather Bureau {{predicted that}} the storm would bring high surf to areas {{as far north as}} North Carolina. Additionally, it was suggested that Gladys could have threatened northern Florida, as the storm was on a similar path as Hurricane Dora. As a result, residents along the coast of the Southeastern United States were advised to remain alert and small craft <b>advisories</b> were issued. On September20, small craft <b>advisories</b> were issued for The Bahamas. After Gladys turned northwestward on September21, forecasters at the United State Weather Bureau issued hurricane watches for North Carolina, Virginia, and some Mid-Atlantic states. Gale warnings and small craft <b>advisories</b> were issued on September23 from Massachusetts to Rhode Island. In Rhode Island, ships of the United States Navy were diverted to Narragansett Bay as a precaution. At 0400UTC on September24, the gale warnings for New England were lowered as Gladys turned northeastward away from the coast however, small water craft were advised to remain in port until the seas subsided.|$|E
5|$|Between 1970 and 1975, <b>advisories</b> for {{systems in}} the eastern Pacific basins were {{initiated}} by the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC) {{as part of the}} National Weather Service (NWS) office in San Francisco, California. At that time, the <b>advisories</b> released were written in cooperation with the United States Navy Fleet Weather Center in Alameda and the Air Force Hurricane Liaison Officer at the McClellan Air Force Base. Following the move of the hurricane center to Redwood City in 1976, track files were created and altered by Arthur Pike and were later re-modified following the release of a study in 1980. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) extended its authority to the EPHC in 1988, and subsequently began maintaining the tracks.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{considered}} dissipated, a re-analysis of satellite imagery indicated {{the circulation of}} Olaf persisted as turned to the west toward open waters. Early on September 30, the system reached the Pacific, and it continued westward for about a week, during which it retained some convective activity. On October 5, Olaf turned toward the east, as it interacted with the large circulation of developing Hurricane Pauline. Later that day, the NHC resumed issuing <b>advisories,</b> while it was located about 560 miles (900km) southwest of {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California Peninsula. The system turned to the southeast, and, failing to organize, the NHC discontinued <b>advisories</b> on October 8. Three days later, after the remnants of Olaf turned toward the north, the NHC again resumed <b>advisories,</b> when it was just 70 miles (115km) south-southwest of Tecomán, Colima. Late on October 12, the circulation of Olaf made its final landfall near Manzanillo, Colima, and it quickly dissipated. An associated area of thunderstorms moved over open waters again, but failed to redevelop.|$|E
