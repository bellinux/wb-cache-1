[...] Studdard collaborated with the artist Ne-Yo on this album, along with a variety of producers. The single [...] "Change Me" [...] {{was released}} ahead of the album. The Return sold 71,000 copies in its first week to open at number eight on the Billboard 200 album chart, but sales declined rapidly <b>after</b> <b>that,</b> <b>not</b> approaching those of his earlier albums. [...] However, Studdard did have good success on the Urban Contemporary chart with [...] "Change Me" [...] (which reached number one) and its successor [...] "Make Ya Feel Beautiful". Studdard continued to tour, saying he would play a variety of music: [...] "Coming out to my show is like coming to my house. I'll play the songs I love. It's like a party. For me, a party has all different types of music happening." ...|$|E

60|$|Soon <b>after</b> <b>that,</b> <b>not</b> {{knowing what}} more to say, she went away. But walking home across the fields, where full summer was {{swinging}} on the delicious air {{and there was}} now no bull but only red cows to crop short the 'milk-maids' and buttercups, she suffered from this strange revelation {{of the strength of}} softness and passivity--as though she had seen in the white figure of 'Anonyma,' and heard in her voice something from beyond, symbolic, inconceivable, yet real.|$|E
60|$|But {{he himself}} agrees with this theory of mine; for he says shortly <b>after,</b> <b>that</b> <b>not</b> only philosophers, {{but even the}} ancient Romans, had {{separated}} superstition from religion; and that the word was first applied to those who prayed all day ut liberi sui sibi superstites essent--might survive them. On the etymology no one will depend who knows the remarkable absence of any etymological instinct in the ancients, in consequence of their weak grasp of that sound inductive method which has created modern criticism. But if it be correct, it is a natural and pathetic form for superstition {{to take in the}} minds of men who saw their children fade and die; probably the greater number of them beneath diseases which mankind could neither comprehend nor cure.|$|E
6000|$|So this {{beautiful}} genius, and I recall with comfort the gratitude I drew from his {{reference to the}} intensity of suggestion that may reside in the stray figure, the unattached character, the image en disponibilite. It gave me higher warrant than I seemed then to have met for just that blest habit of one's own imagination, the trick of investing some conceived or encountered individual, some brace or group of individuals, with the germinal property and authority. I was myself so much more antecedently conscious of my figures than of their setting--a too preliminary, a preferential interest in which struck me as in general such a putting of the cart before the horse. I might envy, though I couldn't emulate, the imaginative writer so constituted as to see his fable first and to make out its agents afterwards. I could think so little of any fable that didn't need its agents positively to launch it; I could think so little of any situation that didn't depend for its interest {{on the nature of}} the persons situated, and thereby on their way of taking it. There are methods of so-called presentation, I believe among novelists who have appeared to flourish--that offer the situation as indifferent to that support; but I have not lost the sense of the value for me, at the time, of the admirable Russian's testimony to my not needing, all superstitiously, to try and perform any such gymnastic. Other echoes from the same source linger with me, I confess, as unfadingly--if it be not all indeed one much-embracing echo. It was impossible <b>after</b> <b>that</b> <b>not</b> to read, for one's uses, high lucidity into the tormented and disfigured and bemuddled question of the objective value, and even quite into that of the critical appreciation, of [...] "subject" [...] in the novel.|$|E

However, <b>after</b> <b>that,</b> <b>not</b> even Maddicks recalls much about his own past for some reason. When he was {{selected}} to be a special agent of the Roxxon Oil Company, Maddicks became a mercenary and professional criminal, more specifically a special agent in covert operations. He was sent to the Mutagenics Laboratory of the Brand Corporation, where he underwent extensive conditioning which increased his human abilities. He also underwent surgery which implanted a miniature anti-gravity generator in his spine. Roxxon later gave Maddicks his super-villain costume and the codename [...] "Killer Shrike".|$|E

Muhammad ibn Ilyas was, however, shortly freed {{after receiving the}} support of Bal'ami and was sent on a campaign in Gurgan. In 930 a revolt by Nasr's brothers broke out. They proclaimed one of their own, Yahya, as amir. Bal’ami managed to quell the rebellion by turning the brothers against each other. In 933, Bal'ami, along with Simjur al-Dawati, fought against the Dailamite military leader Makan ibn Kaki. In 938, Bal'ami was succeeded by Abu Ali Jayhani. <b>After</b> <b>that,</b> <b>not</b> much more is known about Bal'ami; he died on November 14, 940.

50|$|Dobie was {{transferred}} to West Bromwich Albion on 6 July 2001 for an initial £150,000 fee, with another £50,000 being paid once he reached 25 appearances for his new club. He made his Albion début against Walsall on 11 August 2001. His first goal for the club came on 22 August 2001 in a League Cup tie at Cambridge United, when he lobbed the opposition goalkeeper from 30 yards out. He enjoyed an impressive September, scoring his first league goal for Albion in a 4-0 win over Manchester City, and thus commencing a scoring streak of eight goals in seven games. However he struggled to find the net <b>after</b> <b>that,</b> <b>not</b> scoring again until February. Nonetheless, he finished the season as the club's top scorer with 11 league goals, 13 in total. His performances helped Albion get promoted to the Premier League in 2001-02.|$|E

50|$|This was Wellingtons second Ranfurly Shield defence of {{the year}} and {{followed}} on from their opening loss of the season. At this stage, Auckland had had two bad losses {{at the start of the}} season but had beaten Northland the week before. Wellington immediately took control of the game and Wellington wing, Hosea Gear went over after just six minutes. The two teams both traded penalties early in the half and <b>after</b> <b>that</b> <b>not</b> another point was scored before halftime. John Schwalger crashed over for Wellington early in the second half but Auckland replacement first five Daniel Bowden hit back, making the score 13-8. Wellington first five Faatonu Fili slotted an important drop goal extending the lead held by Wellington to eight points. A converted try to Taniela Moa reduced the margin to just 1 point but it was enough. Wellington held on.

Aubenas in France, Sierre in Switzerland and Zelzate in Belgium fraternized with Schwarzenbek in the year of 1955. Two more cities in Europe followed in 1960 including Cesenatico in Italy and Delfzijl in the Netherlands.

5000|$|After Texas reentered the Union {{after the}} Civil War, Van Zandt County again tried {{to secede from}} Texas, the Confederate States of America, and the United States. A {{convention}} was held in 1867 in which the citizens elected delegates, and the delegates voted for secession, and penned a Declaration of Independence modeled after the United States Declaration of Independence. The event {{was seen as a}} rebellion by the nation, and when word reached General Sheridan, he dispatched a cavalry unit to quell it. The citizens of Van Zandt called an emergency meeting which ended with the delegates declaring war on the United States. The wooded landscape at the time made it difficult for horses to move through, so the citizens of Van Zandt, familiar with the area, were able to ambush the unit, until they retreated. The citizens, elated with their victory, celebrated with an excess of alcohol. During their celebration, they were surrounded by Sheridan's troops, and were put in anklets and in a rough prison of wooden posts. Two ex-Confederate soldiers, W.A. Allen and Hardy Allen [...] were in the group, and W.A. Allen used a hidden knife to wear down the anklets. A combination of the beginning of the rainy season [...] and a decreasing of the guard to one man [...] allowed the prisoners to easily escape. <b>After</b> <b>that,</b> <b>not</b> much action on the part of Van Zandt or the United States was taken in the issue. Arrest warrants were sent, but none was carried out, and none of the prisoners went to trial.|$|E

30|$|To {{study the}} effect of {{temperature}} on AgNPs formation, the reaction was carried out at 35, 60, 80 and 100  °C in a water bath. The spectra were recorded after 1  h of reaction. As the temperature is increased, the rate of formation of AgNPs is also increased indicated by increase in the absorbance. Figure S 7 represents UV–Vis spectra of AgNPs synthesized using H. asiatica at different temperature. At 35  °C, a broad SPR band indicates the formation of poly-dispersed AgNPs. With increase in the reaction temperature, the SPR band becomes narrow signifying the monodispersed nature of NPs. The λ max of SPR band is shifted from 436 to 406  nm, due to the reduction in size of the NPs.
