[...] After contemplating over which rapper would be featured on the song, even sending the song to Eminem with hopes he would get on the song, Tech N9ne decided to feature American rapper Kendrick Lamar on the song. This song would be Tech N9ne and Lamar's second collaboration.|$|E

But I was not pleased to read the description in the catalogue: no good in a bed, but fine up against a wall".|$|E

500|$|According to Vanderbilt's All-Southern halfback and 1924 captain-elect Gil Reese, [...] "He {{would never}} let them jump on me. Whenever anyone would {{threaten}} me, Bomar was always right there to say 'Keep your hands off that boy'. They always did, too. Bomar always looked <b>after</b> <b>me,</b> and he always called back to me when we started on end runs. No one could run interference like Bomar." [...] Bomar and Reese were on an all-time Vanderbilt team in the school's 1934 yearbook, and Bomar was chosen for an Associated Press Southeast Area all-time football team for the era from 1920 to 1969.|$|E
500|$|When he said Jesus again I couldn't take it, and for {{the only}} time in my life I was discourteous, which I regret to this day. I said, [...] "Mr. Mauriac," [...] we called him Maître, [...] "ten years or so ago, I have seen children, {{hundreds}} of Jewish children, who suffered more than Jesus did on his cross and we do not speak about it." [...] I felt all of a sudden so embarrassed. I closed my notebook and went to the elevator. He ran <b>after</b> <b>me.</b> He pulled me back; he sat down in his chair, and I in mine, and he began weeping.... And then, at the end, without saying anything, he simply said, [...] "You know, maybe you should talk about it." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his last}} full {{season with the}} Indians in 1955, Doby was {{selected}} for his seventh consecutive and final All-Star Game. Doby's leg injuries affected him severely {{at this point in}} his career and he did not enter the game. He finished the 1955 season with 26 home runs and 75 RBIs while hitting [...]291 in 131 games, his fewest played since 1948. Not all in Cleveland were disappointed to see Doby leaving. Wrote one Plain Dealer columnist, Franklin Lewis: [...] "He has been a controversial athlete. Highly gifted, he was frequently morose, sullen, and upon occasion, downright surly to his teammates... He thought of himself, at the beginning, as the symbol of the Negro in his league." [...] Doby responded, [...] "I was looked on as a Black man, not as a human being. I did feel a responsibility to the Black players who came <b>after</b> <b>me,</b> but that was a responsibility, basically, to people, not just to Black people." ...|$|E

500|$|As the voiture {{rolled through}} the dark streets that wintry night, the sad story of Oscar Wilde was in part {{repeated}} to me... Robert Ross knelt by the bedside, assisting me {{as best he could}} while I administered conditional baptism, and afterwards answering the responses while I gave Extreme Unction to the prostrate man and recited the prayers for the dying. As the man was in a semi-comatose condition, I did not venture to administer the Holy Viaticum; still I must add that he could be roused and was roused from this state in my presence. When roused, he gave signs of being inwardly conscious... Indeed I was fully satisfied that he understood me when told that I was about to receive him into the Catholic Church and gave him the Last Sacraments... And when I repeated close to his ear the Holy Names, the Acts of Contrition, Faith, Hope and Charity, with acts of humble resignation to the Will of God, he tried all through to say the words <b>after</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
500|$|During {{his four}} years at Michigan, Woolfolk had what one {{reporter}} described as [...] "a strange love-hate relationship" [...] with Coach Bo Schembechler. Woolfolk noted at the time Schembechler is a [...] "tough coach", and it was [...] "not easy at all" [...] playing for him. Schembechler was often angered by Woolfolk's tendency to try to run around defenders rather than banging through them, resulting in Woolfolk being benched more than once. But Schembechler said Woolfolk [...] "came of age" [...] in the November 1980 Ohio State game. After Woolfolk's MVP performance in the 1981 Rose Bowl helped Schembechler to his first bowl game victory, Bo complimented Woolfolk's powerful performance, noting: [...] "Butch {{can be a real}} load." [...] By the 1981 season, Schembechler was a true believer in Woolfolk, saying: [...] "Today, I can say without reservation, that I'd rather go into a big game with Woolfolk at tailback than any other back in the country." [...] Woolfolk, too, concluded in the end that Schembechler was [...] "key" [...] to his success: [...] "He kept <b>after</b> <b>me.</b> He kept saying I was getting too fancy. He kept saying, 'You're a big back, a fast back, and you ought to be running over people -- not trying to dance around them.'" ...|$|E
500|$|De Laurentiis visited Ridley Scott {{on the set}} of Gladiator and {{suggested}} to Ridley he read the novel he had bought the rights to. Scott was in the third week before principal photography was due to finish on Gladiator. Gladiator became a commercial and critical success, earning 12 Academy Award nominations. De Laurentiis asked Scott if he would like to direct the film version of Hannibal. Scott misunderstood which Hannibal he meant, thinking De Laurentiis was speaking of the general and historical figure from Carthage who nearly brought down the Roman Empire back around 200 B.C., so he replied: [...] "Basically, Dino, I'm doing a Roman epic right now. I don't wanna do elephants coming over the Alps next, old boy." [...] Scott read the manuscript in four sittings within a week, believing it to be a [...] "symphony", and expressed his desire to do it. Scott further explains how he got involved: [...] "I was shooting Gladiator in Malta and one day, for the hell of it, I went for a walk for half a mile down the road to the Malta Film Studio to see my old buddy Dino. I had not seen him since I'd worked on a version of Dune. This was pre-Blade Runner. Dino had pursued me to direct Dune and another film. He's always enthusiastic and aggressive and came <b>after</b> <b>me</b> when I did both Blade Runner and Alien, but I couldn't do the films. Anyway, we had an espresso together and a few days later, he called me to ask if he could visit the Gladiator set. He arrived with a manuscript of Hannibal, about a month before it was published in book form. He said: 'Let's make this one.' I haven't read anything so fast since The Godfather. It was so rich in all kind of ways." ...|$|E
