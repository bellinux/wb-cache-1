50|$|Withanolides are a {{group of}} {{naturally}} occurring C28- steroidal lactones. They contain four cycloalkane ring structures, three cyclohexane rings and one cyclopentane ring. Withaferin A is highly reactive because of the ketone-containing unsaturated A ring, the epoxide in the B ring, and the unsaturated lactone ring. The double bond in ring A and the epoxide ring are mainly responsible for the cytotoxicity. The 22nd and 26th carbons of the ergostane skeleton in withaferin A and related steroidal compounds are oxidized to form a six-membered delta lactone unit. NMR spectral analysis identifies C3 in the unsaturated A ring as the main nucleophilic target site for ethyl mercaptan, thiophenol and L-cysteine ethyl ester in vitro. A library of 2, 3-dihydro-3β-substituted derivatives are synthesized by regio/stereoselective Michael <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>ring</b> A. These analogs are being tested for its activity in neuro-degenerative diseases, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and in cancer.|$|E
5000|$|The {{next major}} {{change to the}} core is with its memory bus. R420 and R300 had nearly {{identical}} memory controller designs, with the former being a bug fixed release designed for higher clock speeds. R520, however, differs with its central controller (arbiter) that connects to the [...] "memory clients". Around the chip there are two 256-bit ring buses running {{at the same speed}} as the DRAM chips, but in opposite directions to reduce latency. Along these ring buses are 4 [...] "stop" [...] points where data exits the ring and going into or out of the memory chips. There is actually a fifth stop, one that is significantly less complex, designed for the PCI Express interface and video input. This design allows memory accesses to be far quicker though lower latency by virtue of the smaller distance the signals need to move through the GPU, and by increasing the number of banks per DRAM. Basically the chip can spread out memory requests faster and more directly to the RAM chips. ATI claims a 40% improvement in efficiency over older designs. Again, the smaller cores such as RV515 and RV530 receive cutbacks due to their smaller, less costly designs. RV530, for example, has two internal 128-bit buses instead. This generation has support for all recent memory types, including GDDR4. In <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>ring</b> bus, each memory channel now has the granularity of 32-bits, which improves memory efficiency when performing small memory requests.|$|E
40|$|An atrazine-degrading {{bacterial}} culture was isolated from an agricultural soil previously impacted by herbicide spills. The organism {{was capable of}} using atrazine under aerobic conditions as the sole source of C and N. Cyanuric acid could replace atrazine as the sole source of N, indicating that the organism was capable of ring cleavage. Ring cleavage was confirmed in 14 CO 2 evolution experiments with [U- 14 C-ring]atrazine. Between 40 and 50 % of ring- 14 C was mineralized to 14 CO 2. [14 C]biuret and [14 C]urea were detected in spent culture media. Cellular assimilation of 14 C was negligible, {{in keeping with the}} fully oxidized valence of the ring carbon. Chloride release was stoichiometric. The formation of ammonium during atrazine degradation was below the stoichiometric amount, suggesting a deficit due to cellular assimilation and metabolite-N accumulation. With excess glucose and with atrazine as the sole N source, free ammonium was not detected, suggesting assimilation into biomass. The organism degraded atrazine anaerobically in media which contained (i) atrazine only, (ii) atrazine and glucose, and (iii) atrazine, glucose, and nitrate. To date, this is the first report of a pure bacterial isolate with the ability to cleave the s-triazine ring structure of atrazine. It was also concluded that this bacterium was capable of dealkylation, dechlorination, and deamination in <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>ring</b> cleavage...|$|E

50|$|Heteroatom <b>additions</b> <b>to</b> <b>rings</b> {{can occur}} through ring {{expansions}} if {{not they are}} not done through de-novo ring synthesis. These introductions are primarily ring expansions because they often take place through migration/insertion pathways similar to those mentioned above for carbon. Examples include high impact applications of the Beckmann rearrangement (for introduction of nitrogen into codeine) and the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation (introduction of oxygen to cage-annulated ethers) in synthesis. Both occur with the expulsion of a leaving group as the alkyl group migrates onto the exocyclic heteroatom, which is strikingly similar to the pinacol type rearrangement.|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{methodology}} was examined in exploratory work {{directed at the}} synthesis of large ring hormone analogs. In the initial approach several benzocycloalkenones were synthesized via condensa-tion of benzynes with cycloalkanones. Required functionalization of the aromatic ring was accomplished either by electrophillic substitu-tion of the benzocycloalkenone or the inclusion of an appropriate func-tional group on the benzyne. Methods examined for ring expansion of the intermediate benzocycloalkenones to the required thirteen mem-bered ring included procedures leading toward cyclopropylcarbinyl rearrangements, Tiffeneau-Demyanov rearrangements, and ring expansion via cycloaddition of enamines with ethyl propiolate. In series of studies not directed toward the synthesis of the target com-pound, the reaction {{of a series of}} benzocycloalkyl oxirenes with lithium diisopropylamide was examined. In <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>ring</b> expansion approaches, several routes leading to proposed ring closure of appropriately substituted benzenes were attempted. First examined was the synthesis of ortho substituted dialkyl benzenes containing terminal carbonyl groups on the alkyl side chains. Reductive coupling of such compounds with Ti(0) would lead to large ring benzocycloalkenes. As part of a scheme calling for ring closure via the acyloin condensation, 7 -bromo- 4 -hydroxyheptanoic acid y- lactone was synthesized and the synthesis of 3 -(2 -carboethoxy- 5 -methoxyphenyl) propanol was examined. In related work, the mechanism of ring expansion via an anionic [1, 3] sigmatropic shift was examined. Also studied was the feasibility of the synthesis of zearalenone analogs via condensation of 3, 5 - dimeth-oxybenzyne with cycloalkanones...|$|E
40|$|The anion {{photoelectron}} {{spectra of}} ortho-, meta-, and para-methylphenoxide, {{as well as}} methyl deprotonated meta-methylphenol, were measured. Using the Slow Electron Velocity Map Imaging technique, the Electron Affinities (EAs) of the o-, m-, and p-methylphenoxyl radicals were measured as follows: 2. 1991 ± 0. 0014, 2. 2177 ± 0. 0014, and 2. 1199 ± 0. 0014 eV, respectively. The EA of m-methylenephenol was also obtained, 1. 024 ± 0. 008 eV. In all four cases, the dominant vibrational progressions observed are due to several ring distortion vibrational normal modes that were activated upon photodetachment, leading to vibrational progressions spaced by ∼ 500 cm− 1. Using the methylphenol O–H bond dissociation energies reported by King et al. and revised by Karsili et al., a thermodynamic cycle was constructed and the acidities of the methylphenol isomers were determined as follows: ΔacidH 0298 K= 348. 39 ± 0. 25, 348. 82 ± 0. 25, 350. 08 ± 0. 25, and 349. 60 ± 0. 25 kcal/mol for cis-ortho-, trans-ortho-, m-, and p-methylphenol, respectively. The excitation energies for the ground doublet state to the lowest excited doublet state electronic transition in o-, m-, and p-methylphenoxyl were also measured as follows: 1. 029 ± 0. 009, 0. 962 ± 0. 002, and 1. 029 ± 0. 009 eV, respectively. In the photoelectron spectra of the neutral excited states, C–O stretching modes were excited in <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>ring</b> distortion modes.

Karst.) stems from the pith to the bark, and from the stem base towards the stem apex. Moreover, {{the variation in}} wood density within annual rings was studied at the different heights and radial positions in the stem. The material consisted of 85 trees from central and south-eastern Finland. Variation between the annual rings accounted for 11 – 27 % of the total variation in wood density. Only small differences (3 – 6 %) in wood density were found between different heights in the stem. The largest (49 – 80 %) variation in wood density was found within the annual rings. The difference in wood density between earlywood and latewood was smaller in the rings near the pith than in the outer rings. The increasing wood density from the pith outwards was related to increasing latewood density and latewood per-centage, whereas the earlywood density increased only slightly from the pith outwards. In a given cambial age (i. e., given rings from the pith), the average wood density of annual rings increased with increasing stem height. In contrast, in the rings formed in the same calendar years (i. e., given rings from the bark), the average wood density of annual rings decreased with increasing stem height. The {{results of this study}} verify our knowledge of wood density variation and can further contribute to creating models to predict wood density...|$|E

30|$|Residents harvest large woody {{vegetation}} for cooking fuel and, in Madjadjane, for charcoal production prior to burns. Smaller woody plants, and sometimes grass, are cut and piled {{on the future}} burn site. These practices contribute to greater fire control. People then create a firebreak around the area to be burned by either excavating a ring ditch 2.0 m to 2.5 m deep by 1.0 m to 2.0 m wide, or by cutting grass down to the soil in a band 0.5 m to 3.0 m wide. Field observations and interview comments indicate that creating a firebreak by cutting grass {{is the most common}} method used.
