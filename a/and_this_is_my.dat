I remember vividly the ballroom in which it took place and which can only be described, Georgette Heyer-style, as "glittering"; the hundreds of chairs (mostly empty when I took mine, near the front); the sense of occasion clearly felt by all participants; the president's modestly arresting opening remarks; and the quality of the four presentations that followed and have since been republished in the 2005 Profession. I am a conference averse individual, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> first MLA convention, attending as I did from an Australian university, but in that ballroom I wondered where else on earth a meeting of that sort could be held in such style.

On the new face of things, i. e., “The Republican Contract with America, ” NTA opinion will not have so much influence on fiscal legislation in the next two years.
