500|$|For modern readers he is {{most famous}} for the Kitab al-I'tibar and his {{descriptions}} of life in Syria during the early crusades. The disjointed {{nature of the work}} has given him a reputation as a senile rambler, although it is actually written with an anthological structure, with humorous or moralistic tales that are not meant to proceed chronologically, as a true autobiography would. Since this style of literature, adab in Arabic, does not necessarily have to be factual, historians <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that Usama's historical material cannot always be trusted. Usama's anecdotes about the crusades are sometimes obvious jokes, exaggerating their [...] "otherness" [...] to entertain his Muslim audience. As Carole Hillenbrand wrote, it would be [...] "dangerously misleading to take the evidence of his book at its face value." ...|$|E
500|$|Lichtenstein uses red Ben-Day dots {{to color}} Mickey's face. According to some art critics, {{this gives the}} {{character}} the appearance of blushing. Other interpretations are that the coloration is merely skin pigmentation or {{that it is the}} hue associated with a [...] "healthy glow," [...] since Mickey has historically been viewed as a creature with skin rather than fur. Another interpretation – supported by the original source in which Mickey says that if Donald can land the fish he can have it for lunch – is that Mickey's face is red due to the exertion necessary to contain his disbelief and laughter while he experiences his amused superiority. Those adhering to the blushing interpretation are bolstered by the uneven blotchiness of the red dots, but others <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that Lichtenstein's Ben-Day dot technique was still in a primitive stage. He did not develop the use of a stencil (i.e. the technique of pressing the liquid paint onto the surface through a screen of dots) to present uniformly distributed dots until 1963.|$|E
2500|$|Freud {{introduced}} the terms [...] "primary" [...] and [...] "secondary" [...] masochism. Though this idea {{has come under}} a number of interpretations, in a primary masochism the masochist undergoes a complete, not just a partial, rejection by the model or courted object (or sadist), possibly involving the model taking a rival as a preferred mate. This complete rejection {{is related to the}} death drive (todestrieb) in Freud's psychoanalysis. In a secondary masochism, by contrast, the masochist experiences a less serious, more feigned rejection and punishment by the model. Secondary masochism, in other words, is the relatively casual version, more akin to a charade, and most commentators <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> its contrivedness.|$|E

2500|$|Nuclear {{facilities}} have long lead times for both environmental and other approvals, {{as well as}} actual construction. Ontario's nuclear history is also chequered with budget overruns and delays in new build and refurbished plants. Nuclear has high capital costs and lead times, but low operational costs, making it suitable only for base load applications. In comparison, natural gas plants have short lead times but high operational and fuel costs. However, recently a range of economic factors have had {{a major impact on}} the cost of nuclear power. Groups such as the [...] <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that fluctuations in uranium prices have made operational costs associated with nuclear generation rise higher than those of natural gas plants and renewables.|$|E
2500|$|Although the Posts authors <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that [...] "not all the {{quarters}} are as bleak as" [...] Building 18, [...] "the despair of Building 18 symbolizes a larger problem in Walter Reed's {{treatment of the}} wounded. The typical soldier is required to file 22 documents with eight different commands – most of them off-post – to enter and exit the medical processing world, according to government investigators. Sixteen different information systems are used to process the forms, but few of them can communicate with one another. The army's three personnel databases cannot read each other's files and can't interact with the separate pay system or the medical recordkeeping databases." [...] This complicated system has required some soldiers to prove {{they were in the}} Iraq War or the War in Afghanistan in order to obtain medical treatment and benefits because Walter Reed employees are unable to locate their records.|$|E
2500|$|But {{for many}} states, {{screening}} is an integrated {{part of the}} department of health which can not or will not be easily replaced. [...] Thus the initial expenditures can be difficult for states with tight budgets to justify. [...] Screening fees have also increased in recent years as health care costs rise and as more states add MS/MS screening to their programs. [...] Dollars spent for these programs may reduce resources available to other potentially lifesaving programs. [...] It has been recommended that one disorder, Short Chain Acyl-coenzyme A Dehydrogenase Deficiency, or SCAD, be eliminated from screening programs, due to a [...] "spurious association between SCAD and symptoms. [...] However, recent studies suggest that expanded screening is cost effective (see [...] and articles published in Pediatrics.

2500|$|Prior to the decision, {{the justices}} {{discussed}} the trimester framework at great length. Justice Powell {{had suggested that}} {{the point where the}} state could intervene be placed at viability, which Justice Thurgood Marshall supported as well. In an internal memo to the other justices before the majority decision was published, Justice Blackmun wrote: [...] "You will observe that I have concluded {{that the end of the}} first trimester is critical. This is arbitrary, but perhaps any other selected point, such as quickening or viability, is equally arbitrary." [...] Roe supporters <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out,</b> however, that the memo only reflects Blackmun's uncertainty about the timing of the trimester framework, not the framework or the holding itself. In his opinion, Blackmun also clearly explained how he had reached the trimester framework – scrutinizing history, common law, the Hippocratic Oath, medical knowledge, and the positions of medical organizations. Justice Blackmun's trimester framework was later rejected by the O'Connor–Souter–Kennedy plurality in Casey, in favor of the [...] "undue burden" [...] analysis still employed by the Court. Contrary to Blackmun, Justice Douglas preferred the first-trimester line. Justice Stewart said the lines were [...] "legislative" [...] and wanted more flexibility and consideration paid to state legislatures, though he joined Blackmun's decision. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. proposed abandoning frameworks based on the age of the fetus and instead allowing states to regulate the procedure based on its safety for the mother.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2005, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston {{economist}} Christopher Foote and {{his research}} assistant Christopher Goetz, published a working paper, {{in which they}} argued that the results in Donohue and Levitt's abortion and crime paper were due to statistical errors made by the authors: the omission of state-year interactions {{and the use of}} the total number of arrests instead of the arrest rate in explaining changes in the murder rate. When the corrections were made, Foote and Goetz argued that abortion actually increased violent crime instead of decreasing it and did not affect property crime. They even concluded that the majority of women who had abortions in the 1970s were middle class whites rather than low income minorities as Levitt stated; this was, they stated, because white middle class women had the financial means for an abortion. The Economist remarked on the news of the errors that [...] "for someone of Mr Levitt's iconoclasm and ingenuity, technical ineptitude is a much graver charge than moral turpitude. To be politically incorrect is one thing; to be simply incorrect quite another." [...] In January 2006, Donohue and Levitt published a response, in which they admitted the errors in their original paper but also pointed out Foote and Goetz's correction was flawed due to heavy attenuation bias. The authors argued that, after making necessary changes to fix the original errors, the corrected link between abortion and crime was now weaker but still statistically significant, contrary to Foote and Goetz's claims. Foote and Goetz, however, soon produced a rebuttal of their own and showed that even after analyzing the data using the methods that Levitt and Donohue recommend, the data does not show a positive correlation between abortion rates and crime rates. They <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that this does not necessarily disprove Levitt's thesis, however, and emphasize that with data this messy and incomplete, it is in all likelihood not even possible to prove or disprove Donohue and Levitt's conclusion.|$|E
