5|$|Detective Mike Banner invites Chris for an {{interview}} {{in relation to the}} murder. Beforehand, Chris throws Mrs. Eastby's jewelry and drugs into the river, but by chance her ring bounces on the railing and falls to the pavement. At the police station, Chris lies about his relationship with Nola, but Banner surprises him with her diary, in which he is featured extensively. He confesses his affair but denies any link to the murder, and appeals to the detectives not to involve him further in their investigation as news of the affair may end his marriage just <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> wife are expecting a baby.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Gelimer {{remained}} blockaded by Pharas at {{the mountain}} stronghold of Medeus, {{but as the}} blockade dragged through the winter, Pharas grew impatient. He attacked the mountain stronghold, only to be beaten back {{with the loss of}} a quarter of his men. While a success for Gelimer, it did not alter his hopeless situation <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> followers remained tightly blockaded and began to suffer from lack of food. Pharas sent him messages calling upon him to surrender and spare his followers the misery, {{but it was not until}} March that the Vandal king agreed to surrender after receiving guarantees for his safety. Gelimer was then escorted to Carthage.|$|E

5|$|Gould {{missed the}} entire 1891 {{campaign}} <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> brother Bob had travelled to the West Indies to conduct civil engineering work. Gould regained his international {{place and the}} captaincy on his return for the 1892 Home Nations Championship. The tournament was a failure for Wales; the team lost all three of their matches. There was little consistency for Gould at centre, with three different centre-pairings {{in each of the}} matches; Garrett against England, Conway Rees at home to Scotland and in the Irish encounter, Gould's younger brother Bert. The 1892 Championship was soured by the aftermath of the Wales–Scotland encounter, which was played in Swansea at St. Helen's. After Wales lost the game 7–2, members of the crowd, angered by Jack Hodgson's refereeing of the game, attacked him. The assailants by-passed the police and the referee had to be rescued by members of the Welsh team. In the struggle, Gould was struck on the chin, and it was reported that Hodgson only reached the Mackworth Hotel because Gould accompanied him on the coach.|$|E
5|$|Jon Snow {{is first}} {{introduced}} in A Game of Thrones (1996), <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> five siblings adopt six orphaned direwolf cubs. As Ned Stark's illegitimate son and with Ned's wife Catelyn despising him, Jon has always felt {{removed from the}} rest of the Stark family. He resolves to join the Night's Watch, as his status as a bastard prevents him from holding lands or marrying into a good family. At The Wall, the other recruits resent Jon's aura of superiority, but he makes amends by helping them master swordplay. He also befriends Samwell Tarly, a cowardly lordling who, despite being helpless with weapons, displays an aptitude for book learning. Jon's independence and his compassion for the recruits invite the ire of the harsh master-at-arms Alliser Thorne, who sees Jon as a threat to his authority. Jon gains the notice of the Lord Commander, Jeor Mormont, who names Jon his personal squire and grooms Jon for command. After learning of his father's execution, Jon resolves to desert the Night's Watch and join his half brother Robb, but the other recruits convince Jon to remain loyal to his Night's Watch vows. The next night, Jon saves Mormont's life by killing an undead wight. Mormont then orders a Great Ranging beyond the Wall to learn more of this new threat.|$|E

5|$|On 31 July, Contador's agent {{announced}} that Contador had {{turned down an}} offer to remain with Astana under a new four-year contract because he had felt uncomfortable being caught between the Kazakhs {{on one side and}} Bruyneel on the other, and he was hoping to leave Astana before his contract expired in 2010. However, on 11 August, Contador's close friend Sergio Paulinho accepted a two-year contract with Team RadioShack, indicating that Contador {{might not be able to}} leave Astana <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> agent wished. This was confirmed on 15 August, when a spokesperson for the Kazakh sponsors of Astana said that they intended to sponsor the Astana team on the UCI ProTour through 2013 and that they intended to enforce the last year of Contador's contract with Astana in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{legality}} of Virginia's confiscation of the Northern Neck Proprietary lands {{continued to be}} contested {{in state and federal}} courts long after Denny Fairfax's death in 1800. The Virginia Supreme Court upheld the state's confiscation and conveyance of the proprietary's lands, arguing that the terms of the Jay Treaty with the Kingdom of Great Britain did not address the disputed proprietary. In 1813, the United States Supreme Court reviewed the Virginia Supreme Court's decision in Fairfax's Devisee v. Hunter's Lessee, 11 U.S. 603, and ruled that the treaty did in fact cover the dispute, and remanded the case back to the state supreme court. The Virginia Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. Supreme Court did not have authority over cases originating in state courts. The state supreme court's refusal to accept the U.S. Supreme Court's mandate was appealed in 1816 in Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 14 U.S. 304. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the state court's decision on appeal and ruled that Article Three of the United States Constitution granted the U.S. Supreme Court jurisdiction and authority over state courts on matters involving federal law. Chief Justice John Marshall was forced to recuse himself from ruling in Martin v. Hunter's Lessee <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> brother James had previously contracted with Denny Fairfax to purchase the disputed proprietary lands.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, in 1688, in {{response}} to counterfeiting and {{to raise money to}} support the Nine Years' War, Castaing proposed a method of reshaping and restriking existing coins, which was ultimately accepted. Castaing's edge lettering machine was used on the overstruck coins, and the Royal Mint supervisor Martin Masselin, the individual who undertook the process, was obligated to pay Castaing for its use. In 1691, Masselin was dismissed, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> clerks were found to have stolen from the Mint during the reformation of the coinage, and Castaing was appointed to perform the edge lettering and restriking in his place. A second reform took place in 1693. Castaing was imprisoned in 1700 on charges of using inaccurate scales to weigh the coins to be reminted; according to his wife, Marie Hippolyte Castaing (née Bosch), the allegations were false, originating from opponents who lost money {{as a result of his}} machine's introduction to the French Mint and the resulting monetary reforms.|$|E

25|$|In July 1945 the IJN's {{remaining}} large warships were concentrated {{near the}} major naval base of Kure.
