5|$|On 18 April the Mediterranean Fleet sortied to bombard {{the primary}} Axis supply port of Tripoli and was {{attacked}} by <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> torpedo-carrying SM.79s from Rhodes. They were intercepted by <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> Fulmars that damaged one bomber badly enough that it crash-landed back at its base, although one Fulmar was also forced to crash-land aboard Formidable. The next day Fulmars from 806 Squadron shot down one CANT Z.1007 bomber flying from Cyrenica to Sicily and <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> Junkers Ju 52 transports flying fuel to North Africa. On the morning of 21 April, the carrier's aircraft dropped flares to illuminate the port {{so it could be}} shelled by three battleships and a light cruiser. On the way home, <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> Fulmars shot down a Dornier Do 24 flying boat.|$|E

5|$|During the Evacuation of Greece, Formidable {{provided}} {{air cover}} for Convoy GA-15 on 29 April. A Fulmar from 803 Squadron {{was forced to}} ditch on 2 May before the carrier returned to Alexandria the next day. She put to sea on 6 May to provide air cover for the convoys involved in Operation Tiger. On the morning of 8 May, <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> Fulmars claimed to have shot down <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> Z.1007s searching for the fleet; one Fulmar failed to return. Later that afternoon, the fighters shot down four German Heinkel He 111 bombers {{at the cost of}} one Fulmar forced to crash-land. Two Albacores and a Fulmar crashed due to non-combat causes during the day. The next day <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> Fulmars from 806 Squadron badly damaged a Ju 88 reconnaissance bomber that crash-landed at its base in Sicily. As the fleet and the Tiger convoy approached Alexandria on 11 May, <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> Fulmars attacked a formation of Ju 88s, damaging one bomber; one Fulmar and another Ju 88 were seen falling together towards the sea. Many of the Fulmars had been rendered unserviceable during the operation and Formidable was unable to provide air cover until they were repaired.|$|E

5|$|In the {{overtime}} period, Alabama was {{on offense}} first. McCarron opened their drive with <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> incompletions to Richardson. After a five-yard substitution penalty and a five-yard quarterback sack by Sam Montgomery, Foster missed a 52-yard field goal. On LSU's possession, Ware had a three-yard rush and then Ford had a 15-yard run {{to give the}} Tigers a first down from the Alabama seven. After <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> runs that netted a loss of one yard, on third down, Alleman kicked a 25-yard field goal to give LSU the 9–6 victory.|$|E
5|$|Just as {{the first}} half was {{dominated}} by both defenses, the second was no different with both Alabama and LSU only managing <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> field goals. Alabama's came in the third on a 46-yard Cade Foster score and LSU's came in the fourth on a 30-yard Alleman score. In the overtime period, Foster missed a 52-yard field goal attempt and Alleman connected on a 25-yard attempt to give the Tigers the 9–6 victory. Both defenses held each offense to less than 300 yards of total offense with each having <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> interceptions. With the loss, Alabama dropped to 4–8 all-time in overtime games and brought Alabama's all-time record against the Tigers to 45–25–5.|$|E

5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} the Blades of Exile, {{replacing}} the Blades of Athena used in previous installments {{and the opening}} moments of this game. The weapon is <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> blades that are attached to chains wrapped around the character's wrists and forearms, which can be swung {{in a number of}} maneuvers. During the game, Kratos acquires new weapons—the Claws of Hades, the Nemean Cestus, and the Nemesis Whip—with other combat options. The Nemean Cestus, <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> gauntlets, and the Nemesis Whip, which is similar to the Blades of Exile, are required to advance in parts of the game; for example, the Nemean Cestus is needed to break through objects composed of onyx.|$|E
5|$|LSU {{received}} {{the ball to}} start the second half and started their fifth offensive drive from their own 18. After they gained a first down on a short pass on <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> runs, the Alabama defense stopped the Tigers on their next series to force a punt. Alabama then started from their own 48, but were only able to muster a three and out. This resulted in their first punt of the night from Cody Mandell. With Lee back at quarterback for LSU, he threw his second interception, this time to Mark Barron, to give Alabama possession at the LSU 35. Again the LSU defense held the Alabama offense in check to set up another long field goal attempt. This time Foster connected on a 46-yard field goal to give the Crimson Tide a 6–3 lead. On the next drive, LSU was able to gain <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> first downs primarily with only runs by Jefferson and Ford, but again were forced to punt. Alabama started this drive from their own 11, {{and was able to}} gain <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> first downs on McCarron passes before he threw an interception to Morris Claiborne that was returned to the Alabama 15. The quarter ended two plays later after <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> LSU runs resulted in no gain.|$|E
