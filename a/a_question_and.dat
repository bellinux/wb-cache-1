5|$|Because he {{was delayed}} {{in getting the}} website online, Munroe {{had a lot of}} time {{thinking}} about the design of the blog. He eventually chose to display his entries as individual pages rather than using an infinite scrolling page, as he considers the latter more difficult to digest. Munroe usually chooses questions he already knows something interesting about, or after reading a scientific paper, he keeps an eye out for questions in which he can bring it up. Munroe has said that the volume of questions has been high enough that it is impossible to read all of them. Answering <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>and</b> writing a post takes him about a day of solid work.|$|E
5|$|Round two {{consisted}} of five questions posed to the players. The host read <b>a</b> <b>question,</b> <b>and</b> {{one of the}} contestants buzzed-in and provided a response. Their response, along with two other choices, were provided {{to the other two}} contestants, who selected one of the choices. Correct answers earned three spins for a buzz-in answer and one spin for a multiple choice answer. After five questions, all three contestants advanced to the final round.|$|E

5|$|The black raven shakes himself, and he {{responds}} {{that he and}} the rest of the ravens have followed Harald since hatching from their eggs. The raven expresses surprise that the valkyrie seems unfamiliar with the deeds of Harald, and tells her about his deeds for several stanzas. At stanza 15, <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>and</b> answer format begins where the valkyrie asks the raven a question regarding Harald, and the raven responds in turn. This continues until the poem ends abruptly.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} teaser {{trailers}} were released on 16 October 2006. Wright, Pegg, and Frost maintained several video blogs, which were released {{at various times}} throughout {{the production of the}} film. Wright and Frost held a panel at the 2006 Comic-Con convention in San Diego, California to promote Hot Fuzz, which included preliminary footage and <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>and</b> answer session. The two returned to the convention again in 2007 to promote the US DVD release. Advance screenings of the film took place on 14 February 2007 in the UK and the world premiere was on 16 February 2007. The premiere included escorts from motorcycle police officers and the use of blue carpet instead of the traditional red carpet.|$|E
5|$|Rehearsals {{began in}} Russell Square, London, with a read through. After {{a week of}} rehearsing, Welles left to secure further funding and Edwards {{directed}} the play, working on blocking and lighting. Welles returned {{two days before the}} premiere and the cast had their first dress rehearsal, which lasted until 3 a.m. After premiering at the Grand Opera House in Belfast on February 13, 1960, and receiving a good review from a Variety correspondent, the play closed after five performances because of low attendances. It moved to the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin, where it fared no better. By {{the end of the second}} week, Welles had resorted to reading portions of the works of Irish author J. M. Synge, and from Riders to the Sea, to attract an audience. Eventually the play simply became a version of An Evening with Orson Welles, which would often include <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>and</b> answer section with the audience and Welles's solo performance of Moby Dick—Rehearsed or the works of Isak Dinesen.|$|E

25|$|Many {{tasks that}} we would like to {{automate}} by using a computer are of question–answer type: we would like to ask <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>and</b> the computer should produce an answer. In theoretical computer science, such tasks are called computational problems. Formally, a computational problem consists of instances together with a solution for each instance. Instances are questions that we can ask, and solutions are desired answers to these questions.|$|E

The special is included on the season 8 DVD set.|$|E

Robin is confounded by a difficult question, while Galahad gives a wrong answer to an easy one; both are hurled into the Gorge of Eternal Peril. Arthur responds to the bridge-keeper's question with <b>a</b> <b>question,</b> <b>and</b> the bridge-keeper is thrown into the chasm for not knowing the answer.|$|E

25|$|Two {{members of}} the winning family play Fast Money {{for a chance to}} win a cash bonus. One {{contestant}} is onstage with the host, while the other is sequestered backstage so that he/she cannot hear the first portion of the round. The first contestant is asked five rapid-fire survey questions and has a set time limit in which to answer them (originally 15 seconds, extended to 20 in 1994). The clock begins to run only after the first question is asked, and the first contestant may pass on <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>and</b> return to it after all five have been asked, if time remains.|$|E

In so doing, the Gemara will highlight semantic disagreements between Tannaim and Amoraim (often ascribing a view to an earlier authority as to how he may have answered <b>a</b> <b>question),</b> <b>and</b> compare the Mishnaic views with passages from the Baraita. Rarely are debates formally closed; in some instances, the final word determines the practical law, but in many instances the issue is left unresolved.

25|$|The {{publicity}} {{strategy for}} War Horse unusually featured preview screenings {{for the public}} in U.S. heartland areas before either the critics were shown the film or it was screened {{to the public in}} major metropolitan areas. The first preview screenings of War Horse were held at various locations across the U.S. on 1, 2 and 10 November 2011. Military veterans in Canada were invited to seven different screenings on 16 November, in honour of Remembrance Day, five days earlier. More preview screenings in the U.S. took place on 27 November, with Spielberg attending <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>and</b> answer session at the New York screening that was beamed to the other screening cinemas and shown live on the internet.|$|E

25|$|Callwell’s 2 volume “Life and Diaries” in 1927 damaged Wilson’s {{reputation}} – the “New Statesman” {{thought they}} showed {{him to be}} “the typically stupid militarist…fundamentally a fool” Sir Charles Deedes, who had studied under him at Staff College and later served on his staff, commented that Wilson came across in the diaries as “an ambitious, volatile and even fatuous character, an intriguer concerned mainly with his own career” {{and that this was}} “far from the truth” – Deedes commented that Wilson’s ability to see both sides of <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>and</b> inability to make a decision and stick to it made him a poor corps commander but a “patient, lucid and fair” adviser. Lloyd George’s view in his own “War Memoirs” was essentially similar, although he wrote that Wilson was reluctant to take responsibility for decisions.|$|E
