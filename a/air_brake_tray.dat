5000|$|Independent <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> leaked off: With all the {{locomotives}} shut down, the {{air compressor}} no longer supplied {{air to the}} <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> system.

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>brake</b> {{system has}} been widely used in heavy trucks and {{intercity}} buses for its great superiority over other brake system. The practical performance of <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> system may be greatly different from if we analyze it with static theory. Thus, {{it is necessary to}} build an integrate <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> system model to simulate the process of brake accurately. However, the dynamic mathematic model of <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> system is very complicate, which makes the model hard to be solved. In this paper, the components of <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> system are decomposed to several basic standard pneumatic components, and then build the system based on these basic standard pneumatic components. The standard pneumatic components which are built in the software-MWorks based on Modelica language include cylinder, nozzle, air reservoir, volume, and air pipe. An <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> system which contains brake valve, relay valve, brake chambers and pipelines is made based on the standard pneumatic components. The simulation results show the dynamic characteristics of <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> system...|$|R
50|$|As <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> must be {{operated}} differently from more common hydraulic systems, most countries require additional training and licensing {{in order to}} legally drive any vehicle using an <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> system. The FMCSA requires that drivers who operate a vehicle equipped with <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> take their driving test in one.|$|R
50|$|Virtually all jet powered {{aircraft}} have an <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> or, in {{the case}} of most airliners, lift spoilers that also act as <b>air</b> <b>brakes.</b> Propeller driven aircraft benefit from the natural braking effect of the propeller when the engine is throttled back, but jet powered aircraft have no such innate braking effect and must utilise <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> to control descent speed. Many early jets used parachutes as <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> on approach (Arado Ar 234, Boeing B-47) or after landing (English Electric Lightning).|$|R
5000|$|However, <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> can be {{made much}} more {{effective}} than vacuum brakes for a given size of <b>brake</b> cylinder. An <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> compressor is usually capable of generating a pressure of [...] vs only [...] for vacuum. With a vacuum system, the maximum pressure differential is atmospheric pressure ( [...] at sea level, less at altitude). Therefore, an <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> system can use a much smaller brake cylinder than a vacuum system to generate the same braking force. This advantage of <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> increases at high altitude, e.g. Peru and Switzerland where today vacuum brakes are used by secondary railways. The much higher effectiveness of <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> and {{the demise of the}} steam locomotive have seen the <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> become ubiquitous; however, vacuum braking is still in use in India, in Argentina and in South Africa, but this will be declining in near future.|$|R

50|$|Although blended braking {{combines}} both {{dynamic and}} <b>air</b> <b>braking,</b> the resulting braking force {{is designed to}} be the same as what the <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> on their own provide. This is achieved by maximizing the dynamic brake portion, and automatically regulating the <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> portion, as the main purpose of dynamic braking is {{to reduce the amount of}} <b>air</b> <b>braking</b> required. This conserves air, and minimizes the risks of over-heated wheels. One locomotive manufacturer, Electro-Motive Diesel (EMD), estimates that dynamic braking provides between 50% to 70% of the braking force during blended braking.|$|R
25|$|On {{the under}} {{side of the}} {{aircraft}} there are three <b>air</b> <b>brakes,</b> two at the front and one at the rear. The front <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> have an area of 0.76m², and a deflection angle of 35°. The rear <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> has an area of 0.46m² and a deflection angle of 40°. The rear <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> is blocked if the airplane carries an external fuel tank. Behind the <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> are the bays for the main landing gear. On the under side of the airplane, just behind {{the trailing edge of}} the wing are attachment points for two JATO rockets. The front section of the fuselage ends at former #28. The rear section of the fuselage starts at former #28a and is removable for engine maintenance.|$|R
50|$|An <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> or, more formally, a {{compressed}} <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> system, {{is a type}} {{of friction}} brake for vehicles in which compressed air pressing on a piston is used to apply the pressure to the brake pad needed to stop the vehicle. <b>Air</b> <b>brakes</b> are used in large heavy vehicles, particularly those having multiple trailers which must be linked into the brake system, such as trucks, buses, trailers, and semi-trailers in addition to their use in railroad trains. George Westinghouse first developed <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> for use in railway service. He patented a safer <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> on March 5, 1872. Westinghouse made numerous alterations to improve his <b>air</b> pressured <b>brake</b> invention, which led to various forms of the automatic brake. In the early 20th century, after its advantages were proven in railway use, it was adopted by manufacturers of trucks and heavy road vehicles.|$|R

50|$|<b>Air</b> Brakes: <b>Air</b> <b>Brake</b> {{endorsements}} {{are required}} for any driver of a vehicle with an air only system or a combination <b>air</b> and hydraulic <b>braking</b> system.

On all classes, except Class 1, the endorsement will be represented as a Q on the licence. It is not shown on the Class 1 licence because all Class 1 drivers licensed in Alberta are required to have attended an approved <b>Air</b> <b>Brake</b> course - Class 1 operators licence can't be obtained without it. Note: The written knowledge test for Class 1 can be taken prior to having attended an <b>Air</b> <b>Brake</b> course, however driver training can't commence until after the course is completed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Air</b> <b>brake</b> {{systems have}} been widely used in heavy trucks and {{intercity}} buses for its great superiority over other brake system. In traditional, many researchers focused on the vehicle dynamics which employ the static characteristic of brake system to analysis the vehicle brake capacity. In fact, the practical performance of <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> system may be greatly different from the static theory. Thus, it is necessary to build an integrate <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> system model to simulate the process of brake accurately. Also, some works focused on the dynamic characteristics of brake system have been completed, but it is not comprehensive without the considering the effect of vehicle dynamics. In this paper, a completely <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> system dynamic model is built, where the <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> system contains pneumatic subsystem and mechanical subsystem. The <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> system is embedded in a heavy truck dynamic model which contains three axles. The simulation results show the brake distance, vehicle velocity, vehicle deceleration, and brake torque for each wheel in the process of brake...|$|R
50|$|Each {{hopper car}} had wheels that were {{equipped}} with an ordinary <b>air</b> <b>brake.</b> The <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> consist of a metal shoe that presses against the flange of the wheels when the <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> are activated. The slower a wheel moves, the more efficiently the friction can convert to traction instead of heat. The faster a wheel moves, the more efficiently friction converts the other way around. Thus, <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> work optimally when traveling at speeds under 25 mph as this is {{the speed at which}} traction is gained more than heat via the input of friction. The effectiveness of the <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> on MJLBP-11's fully loaded hopper cars (100 tons each on a 2.2% grade) would have had only a limited effect on the braking potential of the train, becoming exponentially weaker and hotter as the speed of the train increased.|$|R
2500|$|A large <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> {{was built}} into the tail cone of the aircraft. [...] The {{hydraulically}} operated <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> formed two leaves that could be opened into the airstream to quickly decelerate the aircraft. [...] The style of <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> chosen by Blackburn was highly effective in the dive-attack profile that the Buccaneer was intended to perform, as well as effectively balancing out induced drag from operating the BLC system. [...] It featured a variable incidence tailplane that could be trimmed to suit the particular requirements of low-speed handling, or high-speed flight; the tailplane had to be high mounted due to the positioning and functionality of the Buccaneer's <b>air</b> <b>brake.</b>|$|R
