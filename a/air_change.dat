500|$|Welders {{are also}} often exposed to {{dangerous}} gases and particulate matter. [...] While the process doesn't produce smoke, {{the brightness of}} the arc in GTAW can break down surrounding air to form ozone and nitric oxides. The ozone and nitric oxides react with lung tissue and moisture to create nitric acid and ozone burn. Ozone and nitric oxide levels are moderate, but exposure duration, repeated exposure, and {{the quality and quantity of}} fume extraction, and <b>air</b> <b>change</b> in the room must be monitored. Welders who do not work safely can contract emphysema and oedema of the lungs, which can lead to early death. Similarly, the heat from the arc can cause poisonous fumes to form from cleaning and degreasing materials. Cleaning operations using these agents should not be performed near the site of welding, and proper ventilation is necessary to protect the welder.|$|E
2500|$|However, if such {{a shelter}} is unavailable, the person should then be advised to follow the Shelter in Place protocol, or if given, Emergency {{evacuation}} advice. Evacuation orders would entail exiting the area completely by following a path perpendicular to the wind direction, and therefore perpendicular to {{the path of the}} fallout plume. While [...] "sheltering in place" [...] is staying indoors, in a preferably sealed tight basement, or internal room, for a number of hours, with the oxygen supply available in such a scenario being more than sufficient for 3+ hours in even the smallest average room, under the assumption that the improvised seal is perfect, until carbon dioxide levels begin to reach unsafe values and necessitate room unsealing for a number of minutes to create a room <b>air</b> <b>change.</b>|$|E

It {{certainly}} was not very diverting; and, if by easy you mean easy to decipher,' she added laughing, 'his handwriting must have improved very much lately. Dear Plantagenet, I am always afraid I never pay him sufficient respect; that I do not feel sufficient awe in his presence; but I cannot disconnect him from the playfellow of my infancy; and, do you know, it seems to me, whenever he addresses me, his voice and <b>air</b> <b>change,</b> and assume quite the tone and manner of childhood.' ...|$|E
60|$|We {{now turn}} to peculiarities in the {{so-called}} Medium, such as floating in <b>air,</b> <b>change</b> of bulk, and escape from lesion when handling or treading in fire. Mr. Tylor says nothing of Sir William Crookes's cases (1871), but speaks of the alleged levitation, or floating in air, of savages and civilised men. These are recorded in Buddhist and Neoplatonic writings, and among Red Indians, in Tonquin (where a Jesuit saw and described the phenomena, 1730), in the 'Acta Sanctorum,' and among modern spiritualists. In 1760, Lord Elcho, being at Home, {{was present at the}} procès for canonising a Saint (unnamed), and heard witnesses swear to having seen the holy man levitated. Sir W. Crookes attests having seen Home float in air on several occasions. In 1871, the Master of Lindsay, now Lord Crawford and Balcarres, F.R.S., gave the following evidence, which was corroborated by the two other spectators, Lord Adare and Captain Wynne.|$|E
60|$|I had {{intended}} to return {{in a day or}} two, but it pleased Fate to hold me from that side of the county, on many pretexts, till the elder and the wild rose had fruited. There came at last a brilliant day, swept clear from the south-west, that brought the hills within hand's reach--a day of unstable airs and high filmy clouds. Through no merit of my own I was free, and set the car for the third time on that known road. As I reached the crest of the Downs I felt the soft <b>air</b> <b>change,</b> saw it glaze under the sun; and, looking down at the sea, in that instant beheld the blue of the Channel turn through polished silver and dulled steel to dingy pewter. A laden collier hugging the coast steered outward for deeper water and, across copper-coloured haze, I saw sails rise one by one on the anchored fishing-fleet. In a deep dene behind me an eddy of sudden wind drummed through sheltered oaks, and spun aloft the first day sample of autumn leaves. When I reached the beach road the sea-fog fumed over the brickfields, and the tide was telling all the groins of the gale beyond Ushant. In less than an hour summer England vanished in chill grey. We were again the shut island of the North, all the ships of the world bellowing at our perilous gates; and between their outcries ran the piping of bewildered gulls. My cap dripped moisture, the folds of the rug held it in pools or sluiced it away in runnels, and the salt-rime stuck to my lips.|$|E
40|$|Studies {{were made}} in a {{modified}} hospital ward containing 19 beds, 14 {{of them in the}} open ward, one in a window-ventilated side-room, two in rooms with partial-recirculation ventilators giving 7 - 10 <b>air</b> <b>changes</b> per hour, and two in self-contained isolation suites with plenum ventilation (20 <b>air</b> <b>changes</b> per hour), ultra-violet (UV) barriers at doorways and airlocks...|$|R
50|$|The {{infiltration}} rate is the {{volumetric flow rate}} of outside air into a building, typically in cubic feet per minute (CFM) or liters per second (LPS). The air exchange rate, (I), {{is the number of}} interior volume <b>air</b> <b>changes</b> that occur per hour, and has units of 1/h. The air exchange rate is also known as <b>air</b> <b>changes</b> per hour (ACHs).|$|R
50|$|Another common metric is the <b>air</b> <b>changes</b> {{per hour}} at a {{specified}} building pressure, again, typically at 50 Pa (ACH50).|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} component of natural ventilation is <b>air</b> <b>change</b> rate or air changes per hour: the hourly rate of ventilation divided by {{the volume of the}} space. For example, six air changes per hour means an amount of new air, equal to the volume of the space, is added every ten minutes. For human comfort, a minimum of four air changes per hour is typical, though warehouses might have only two. Too high of an <b>air</b> <b>change</b> rate may be uncomfortable, akin to a wind tunnel which have thousands of changes per hour. The highest <b>air</b> <b>change</b> rates are for crowded spaces, bars, night clubs, commercial kitchens at around 30 to 50 air changes per hour.|$|E
5000|$|Heated {{building}} volume V. At 50·Pa, {{it is called}} the <b>air</b> <b>change</b> rate at 50 Pa and usually noted n50(units: h−1).|$|E
50|$|The {{first step}} is to decide on an {{appropriate}} <b>air</b> <b>change</b> rate for good air quality. As this air flow rate will be supplied through the dynamically insulated ceiling and a mechanical ventilation and heat recovery system (MVHR), energy loss is not a major concern so 1 <b>air</b> <b>change</b> per hour (ach) will be assumed. If the floor to ceiling height is 2.4 m this implies an air flow rate of 240 m3/h, part of which is supplied through the dynamically insulated ceiling and partly through the MVHR.|$|E

5000|$|Ventilation {{rates are}} often {{expressed}} as a volume rate per person (CFM per person, L/s per person). The conversion between <b>air</b> <b>changes</b> per hour and ventilation rate per person is as follows: ...|$|R
2500|$|Perform {{procedures}} in an adequately ventilated room; i.e. minimum of 6 to 12 <b>air</b> <b>changes</b> per hour in facilities with a mechanically ventilated room {{and at least}} 60 liters/second/patient in facilities with natural ventilation ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Air</b> <b>change</b> {{rates are}} often used as rules of thumb in {{ventilation}} design. However, they are seldom used as the actual basis of design or calculation. For example, laboratory ventilation standards indicate recommended ranges for <b>air</b> <b>change</b> rates, as a guideline for the actual design. Residential ventilation rates are calculated based on area of the residence and number of occupants. [...] Non-residential ventilation rates are based on floor area and number of occupants, or a calculated dilution of known contaminants. [...] Hospital design standards use air changes per hour, although this has been criticized.|$|E
50|$|UK {{building}} regulations require one <b>air</b> <b>change</b> {{every two}} hours (0.5 ACH). With traditional extract-only ventilation that means a house boiler would need to warm up a house-full of cold air 12 times a day.|$|E
5000|$|Passive Houses are {{required}} to achieve a whole building <b>air</b> <b>change</b> rate {{of no more than}} 0.6 ac/hr [...] under forced pressurisation and depressurisation testing at 50Pa minimum. On site blower door testing by certified testers is used to prove compliance.|$|E

50|$|The theatre {{building}} was erected at the Baku Boulevard {{when there was}} no greenery yet. The exhaust ventilation system was superseded by forced ventilation. When the movie theater was opened to the public in June 1910, its administration advertised the features of full <b>air</b> <b>change,</b> occurring every 15 minutes and special ozonator.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the middle}} of the {{painting}} [...] "Cossack Picket" [...] (1888), three horses stand in the dawn light; to the right, near the fire, sit resting cossacks who are on watch duty in the steppes. The sky and the unbounded steppes, veiled in lily-blue fog, and wet grass and humid <b>air,</b> <b>change</b> colors gradually.|$|E
50|$|Low-odor, isoparaffinic solvent, in {{addition}} to being lower in odor than solvents typically used in solvent-based systems, also has a higher margin of safety versus stronger solvents. The following discussion on <b>Air</b> <b>Change</b> Index (ACI) illustrates that less air turnover is needed when using low-odor, isoparaffinic solvent in comparison to other solvent-based systems such as alkyds.|$|E
5000|$|Rocket engines have a {{slightly}} different propulsive efficiency (...) than airbreathing jet engines as the lack of intake <b>air</b> <b>changes</b> {{the form of the}} equation. This also means that rockets are able to exceed their exhaust velocity. See diagram.|$|R
50|$|Air {{treatment}} in HVAC applications {{can lead to}} unseen benefits. In a process referred to HVAC load reduction (HLR), air treatment may minimize the number of <b>air</b> <b>changes</b> required to maintain sufficient indoor air quality, thereby reducing energy use.|$|R
30|$|Finally, it is {{important}} to highlight that 0.1 <b>air</b> <b>changes</b> per hour for infiltration are considered and it is worth underlining that the total amount of ventilation and infiltration in Case 2 corresponds to the same quantity used in Case 1.|$|R
50|$|The {{indoor use}} of {{solvent-based}} primer results in increased solvent exposure due to build-up of fumes in the air. One {{way to reduce}} the amount of solvent in the air is to use fans to renew the air. The <b>Air</b> <b>Change</b> Index (ACI) of a solvent is an indication of the margin of safety of a solvent. The lower the ACI, the less air turnover needed.|$|E
50|$|Air changes per hour, or <b>air</b> <b>change</b> rate, {{abbreviated}} ACH or ACPH, is {{a measure}} of the air volume added to or removed from a space (normally a room or house) divided by the volume of the space. If the air in the space is either uniform or perfectly mixed, air changes per hour {{is a measure}} of how many times the air within a defined space is replaced.|$|E
50|$|For {{residential}} buildings, which mostly rely on infiltration {{for meeting}} their ventilation needs, a common ventilation rate measure is the <b>air</b> <b>change</b> rate (or air changes per hour): the hourly ventilation rate {{divided by the}} volume of the space (I or ACH; units of 1/h). During the winter, ACH may range from 0.50 to 0.41 in a tightly air-sealed house to 1.11 to 1.47 in a loosely air-sealed house.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, Golden Air was {{acquired}} by Braathens Aviation and the main Trollhättan - Bromma route {{was taken over by}} Sverigeflyg. On 1 January 2013, Golden <b>Air</b> <b>changed</b> its name to Braathens Regional while retaining the brand name for its Bromma route.|$|R
50|$|The {{barometric}} formula, {{sometimes called}} the exponential atmosphere or isothermal atmosphere, is a formula used to model how the pressure (or density) of the <b>air</b> <b>changes</b> with altitude. The pressure drops approximately by 11.3 Pa per meter in first 1000 meters above sea level.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the problem of}} {{anaesthetic}} gases dilution in operating theatres has been examined, by experiences carried out in a full scale testing room. The performance of two different HVAC plants have been compared, one of them working in static conditions at 20 external <b>air</b> <b>changes</b> per hour, whereas the other has been dynamically driven by an automatic control system between 10 and 20 external <b>air</b> <b>changes</b> per hour. In the latter case, the flow control operate {{as a function of}} the concentration level of tracer gas, simulating a pollutant, sampled in real time by a suitable monitoring system. The results demonstrate that a dynamic HVAC system can guarantee good environmental conditions and satisfactory comfort, as well as remarkable energy savings...|$|R
