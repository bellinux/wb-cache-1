40|$|Excerpt] “As {{securities}} fraud has grown increasingly transnational, {{it has become}} necessary to expand the reach of <b>anti-fraud</b> <b>provisions</b> to persons and entities participating in global securities markets. So far, however, no single antifraud provision exists to govern the entire global marketplace. Although each country strives to combat international {{securities fraud}} by using its own regulatory regime, problems can develop when extraterritorial application of national securities laws leads to regulatory overlapping or conflicts. In light of these problems, {{it is necessary to}} set forth clear guidelines for determining whether national securities laws can apply extraterritorially and, if so, how far they can extend. The U. S., in particular, has longstanding and extensive experience in seeking extraterritorial application of national securities laws. In doing so, the U. S. has developed several tests to justify extraterritoriality, and has bolstered a statutory basis for extraterritorial application of anti-fraud prohibitions in actions brought by the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the U. S. Department of Justice (DOJ). ...|$|R

However, such restrictions could be at odds with the principle of equal treatments of target’s shareholders, provided for by the EU Takeover Directive. In the paper, I argue that only restrictions to dissemination could be reconciled with the equality principle. On the contrary, restrictions to acceptance represent a clear violation of such principle, which can be admitted only if the cumulative application of US law would make the offer unfeasible.

40|$|The 2 ̆ 2 abstain or {{disclose}} 2 ̆ 2 rule, {{which states}} that persons in possession of material non-public information must either disclose that information or refrain from trading on such information, {{is at the heart}} of insider trading law. Despite the complex legal system designed to thwart insider trading, the community 2 ̆ 7 s widespread criticism of such conduct, and the risk of civil and/or criminal sanctions for violation of federal securities law, insider trading cases have been on the rise. This Note argues that a more serious stance against insider trading must be taken in order to achieve the federal securities laws 2 ̆ 7 purposes and so that investors have confidence in the securities markets. The policy behind <b>anti-fraud</b> <b>provisions</b> is 2 ̆ 2 to protect investors against manipulation of stock prices through regulation of transactions upon securities exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets, and to impose regular reporting requirements on companies whose stock is listed on national securities exchanges. 2 ̆ 2 Meanwhile, there are two categories of arguments in favor of insider trading: first, that there are inherent benefits to it and second, that the current system prohibiting insider trading needs to be reorganized. New legislative approaches have been presented as alternative remedies for reducing insider trading. For instance, the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1983, would substantially increase both civil and criminal penalties for insider trading. New legislative proposals such as these should be seen as valuable additions to insider trading law...|$|R
40|$|On April 16, 2010 the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a civil {{complaint}} against Goldman Sachs in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.

Goldman agreed a $ 500 million settlement with the SEC on July 15, 2010. We analyze the ABACUS transaction and the SEC's {{complaint against}} Goldman Sachs in the context of recent technological changes within the investment banking market. Investment banking was historically a relationship-based business, sustained by reputationally intermediated tacit contracts. Recent advances in information technology and financial economics have codified many formerly tacit elements of investment banking. As a result, some investment banking deals are now transacted at arm's length, and rely more upon formal contracts; we argue that, for this type of deal, there is a stronger case for legal rules regulating the investment bank-counterparty relationship. However, some deals continue to be arbitrated by tacit rules and norms and, for these deals, legal rules are less appropriate, because it is very hard for a third party to ascertain tacit understandings made {{in the context of a}} long-lived relationship. An attempt to introduce legal rules into reputationally intermediated relationships may even impair the counterparties' ability to arrive at informal arrangements, and so to trade. The supervision of deals like ABACUS should therefore reflect the extent to which they are transactional or relational; we argue that in neither case is there justification for the application of legal rules or the gap-filling standard of fiduciary duties...|$|R

Application of these provisions provides a federal forum {{as well as a}} private cause of action, which in turn has provided a fertile opportunity for prospective plaintiffs to attempt an application of the securities laws to their specific dilemma. One of the most frequently alleged bases for federal subject matter jurisdiction under the securities laws is the presence of a 2 ̆ 2 note 2 ̆ 2 transaction. In Marine Bank v.

40|$|Theoretical {{studies of}} the {{problems}} of the securities markets in the Russian Federation incline to one or other of the two traditional approaches. The first consists of comparing the definition of "valuable paper" set forth in the current legislation of the Russian Federation, with the theoretical model of "Wertpapiere" elaborated by German scholars more than 90 years ago. The problem with this approach is, in Mr. Pentsov's opinion, that any new features of the definition of "security" that do not coincide with the theoretical model of "Wertpapiere" (such as valuable papers existing in non-material, electronic form) are claimed to be incorrect and removed from the current legislation of the Russian Federation. The second approach works {{on the basis of the}} differentiation between the Common Law concept of "security" and the Civil Law concept of "valuable paper". Mr. Pentsov's research, presented in an article written in English, uses both methodological tools and involves, firstly, a historical study of the origin and development of certain legal phenomena (securities) as they evolved in different countries, and secondly, a comparative, synchronic study of equivalent legal phenomena as they exist in different countries today. Employing the first method, Mr. Pentsov divided the historical development of the conception of "valuable paper" in Russia into five major stages. He found that, despite the existence of a relatively wide circulation of valuable papers, especially in the second half of the 19 th century, Russian legislation before 1917 (the first stage) did not have a unified definition of valuable paper. The term was used, in both theoretical studies and legislation, but it covered a broad range of financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, government bonds, promissory notes, bills of exchange, etc. During the second stage, also, the legislation of the USSR did not have a unified definition of "valuable paper". After the end of the "new economic policy" (1922 - 1930) the stock exchanges and the securities markets in the USSR, with a very few exceptions, were abolished. And thus during the third stage (up to 1985), the use of valuable papers in practice was reduced to foreign economic relations (bills of exchange, stocks in enterprises outside the USSR) and to state bonds. Not surprisingly, there was still no unified definition of "valuable paper". After the beginning of Gorbachev's perestroika, a securities market began to re-appear in the USSR. However, the successful development of securities markets in the USSR was retarded by the absence of an appropriate regulatory framework. The first effort to improve the situation was the adoption of the Regulations on Valuable Papers, approved by resolution No. 590 of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, dated June 19, 1990. Section 1 of the Regulation contained the first statutory definition of "valuable paper" in the history of Russia. At the very beginning of the period of transition to a market economy, a number of acts contained different definitions of "valuable paper". This diversity clearly undermined the stability of the Russian securities market and did not achieve the goal of protecting the investor. The lack of unified criteria for the consideration of such non-standard financial instruments as "valuable papers" significantly contributed to the appearance of numerous fraudulent "pyramid" schemes that were outside of the regulatory scheme of Russia legislation. The situation was substantially improved by the adoption of the new Civil Code of the Russian Federation. According to Section 1 of Article 142 of the Civil Code, a valuable paper is a document that confirms, in compliance with an established form and mandatory requisites, certain material rights whose realisation or transfer are possible only in the process of its presentation. Finally, the recent Federal law No. 39 - FZ "On the Valuable Papers Market", dated April 22 1996, has also introduced the term "emission valuable papers". According to Article 2 of this Law, an "emission valuable paper" is any valuable paper, including non-documentary, that simultaneously has the following features: it fixes the composition of material and non-material rights that are subject to confirmation, cession and unconditional realisation in compliance with the form and procedure established by this federal law; it is placed by issues; and it has equal amount and time of realisation of rights within the same issue regardless of when the valuable paper was purchased. Thus the introduction of the conception of "emission valuable paper" became the starting point in the Russian federation's legislation for the differentiation between the legal regimes of "commercial papers" and "investment papers" similar to the Common Law approach. Moving now to the synchronic, comparative method of research, Mr. Pentsov notes that there are currently three major conceptions of "security" and, correspondingly, three approaches to its legal definition: the Common Law concept, the continental law concept, and the concept employed by Japanese Law. Mr. Pentsov proceeds to analyse the differences and similarities of all three, concluding that though the concept of "security" in the Common Law system substantially differs from that of "valuable paper" in the Continental Law system, nevertheless the two concepts are developing in similar directions. He predicts that in the foreseeable future the existing differences between these two concepts will become less and less significant. On the basis of his research, Mr. Pentsov arrived at the conclusion that the concept of "security" (and its equivalents) is not a static one. On the contrary, it is in the process of permanent evolution that reflects the introduction of new financial instruments onto the capital markets. He believes that the scope of the statutory definition of "security" plays an extremely important role in the protection of investors. While passing the Securities Act of 1933, the United States Congress determined that the best way to achieve the goal of protecting investors was to define the term "security" in sufficiently broad and general terms so as to include within the definition the many types of instruments that in the commercial world fall within the ordinary concept of "security' and to cover the countless and various devices used by those who seek to use the money of others on the promise of profits. On the other hand, the very limited scope of the current definition of "emission valuable paper" in the Federal Law of the Russian Federation entitled "On the Valuable Papers Market" does not allow the <b>anti-fraud</b> <b>provisions</b> of this law to be implemented in an efficient way. Consequently, there is no basis for the protection of investors. Mr. Pentsov proposes amendments which he believes would enable the Russian markets to become more efficient and attractive for both foreign and domestic investors...|$|R
