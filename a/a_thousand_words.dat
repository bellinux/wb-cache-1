500|$|The episode {{received}} critical acclaim, with critics highlighting Ellen Pompeo's performance, Washington's {{direction and}} McKee's writing.

500|$|Core Design's {{original}} {{concept for}} the game was {{to make it more}} like an action-adventure, before the project has evolved into a more classic adventure game. The game was supposed to be [...] "an adventure for people who hadn't played that kind of game before." [...] The protagonist's effective invincibility was a late demand by the executive producer Jeremy Heath-Smith, resulting in a series of minor plot changes. The game's co-designer and the Amiga version's chief programmer Rob Toone said that their idea was to make these parts of the game [...] "interesting without being difficult." [...] Co-designer and the PC version programmer Ian Sabine stated that the lack of text [...] "speeds up gameplay". Regarding the decision to keep the onscreen text to a minimum, Toone said that [...] "too much reading can slow the game or kill it, like The Adventures of Willy Beamish," [...] with the main artist Rolf Mohr adding that [...] "hopefully, a picture will say <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>words</b> and make this system easy to use." [...] According to Toone, [...] "Lucasfilm gets most of its humour out of its text, whereas we hopefully get ours from comical animations and daft happenings." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many parrots can imitate human {{speech or}} other sounds. A study by Irene Pepperberg {{suggested}} a high learning ability in an African grey parrot named Alex.

2500|$|In February 1938, he was {{assigned}} as the first of ten screenwriters to work on The Wizard of Oz. Three days after he started writing he handed in a seventeen-page treatment of what was later known as [...] "the Kansas sequence". While Baum devoted less than <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>words</b> in his book to Kansas, Mankiewicz almost balanced the attention on Kansas to the section about Oz. He felt {{it was necessary to}} have the audience relate to Dorothy in a real world before transporting her to a magic one. By {{the end of the week}} he had finished writing fifty-six pages of the script and included instructions to film the scenes in Kansas in black and white. His goal, according to film historian Aljean Harmetz, was to [...] "capture in pictures what Baum had captured in words—the grey lifelessness of Kansas contrasted with the visual richness of Oz." [...] He was not credited for his work on the film, however.|$|E
2500|$|The games use a text parser for {{entering}} commands at the [...] "What now?" [...] prompt. [...] The parser can interpret more than <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>words</b> to control movement or actions. [...] It {{looks at the}} command, picking out two or three words it knows, ignoring the order, and tries to guess what is meant. [...] For movement, the usual commands for moving 'NORTH', 'SOUTH', 'EAST' and 'WEST' are available (and their abbreviated forms of 'N', 'S', 'E' and 'W') as well as 'UP' and 'DOWN' ('U' and 'D' respectively) {{and a number of}} other directions and 'modes' of movement (like 'JUMP'). [...] For actions, it understands how to pick up objects, opening doors, lighting lamps, as well as dropping objects and wielding them. [...] Additionally, there are commands to invoke 'SAVE' and 'RESTORE' of game positions to cassette tape or floppy disk (for some systems also to RAM), ask for 'HELP', turn off pictures and turn them on again with 'WORDS' and 'PICTURES' respectively, an 'OOPS' command to undo previous commands.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} bag-of-visual-words {{representations}} have gained increasing {{popularity in the}} field of image classification.

It focuses on the vocabulary size needed to com- prehend 95 % and 98 % of the running words of the input (lexical coverage levels indicating comprehension in connection with listening) and on the place of infrequent vocabulary in liturgi- cal discourse. The finding that 4, 000 words and 7, 000 words, respectively, are needed to reach the target levels for lexical coverage suggests that non-native listeners with vocabularies of just <b>a</b> few <b>thousand</b> <b>words</b> may be seriously challenged by church listening...|$|R
