500|$|Hewitt was {{responsible}} for initiating major improvements in Air Force education that took place [...] between 1945 and 1953, playing {{a key role in}} the establishment of RAAF College and the introduction of an <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>training</b> programme. The purpose of the College was, in Hewitt's words, to [...] "sow the seeds of service" [...] for future leaders, helping create a special RAAF esprit de corps. He added that it was [...] "almost a truism that the future RAAF can be no better than the Air Force College". [...] Founded at Point Cook in January 1948, RAAF College's inaugural commandant was Air Commodore Val Hancock, who also drafted its first charter. With the support of the Air Member for Engineering and Maintenance, Air Vice Marshal Ellis Wackett, Hewitt developed the <b>Apprenticeship</b> <b>Training</b> Scheme to raise the standard of technical roles in the Air Force, introducing it with a nationwide publicity campaign to attract recruits. Its base was the Ground Training School, which opened at Wagga, New South Wales, in early 1948 to provide education and technical training for youths aged 15to17. It was renamed RAAF Technical College in 1950 and then the RAAF School of Technical Training in 1952.|$|E

500|$|Hewitt is {{credited}} with being primarily responsible for the [...] "education revolution" [...] {{that took place in}} the RAAF between 1945 and 1953, his initiatives while Air Member for Personnel being carried on by his successor in the position, Air Vice Marshal Frank Bladin. According to Air Force historians Alan Stephens and Keith Isaacs, the importance of RAAF College and the <b>Apprenticeship</b> <b>Training</b> Scheme in contributing to the professionalism of the post-war service [...] "cannot be over-stated". Air Vice Marshal Ernie Hey, the Air Member for Technical Services from 1960 through 1972, declared that the apprenticeship programme was [...] "one of the best things" [...] the RAAF ever established and its graduates—numbering some 5,500 from 1952 to 1993—as [...] "absolutely outstanding". Joe Hewitt is commemorated by Hewitt Reef in Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, named in his honour by the survey team on HMAS Moresby, with whom he worked as a member of No.101 Flight in 1926–28. Hewitt also founded an eponymous trophy for small arms proficiency in the Air Force.|$|E
2500|$|Canadian nursing {{dates back}} to 1639 in Quebec with the Augustine nuns. [...] These nuns were trying {{to open up a}} mission that cared for the spiritual and {{physical}} needs of patients. The establishment of this mission created the first nursing <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>training</b> in North America. [...] In the nineteenth century there were some Catholic orders of nursing that were trying to spread their message across Canada. Most nurses were female and only had an occasional consultation with a physician. Towards {{the end of the nineteenth}} century hospital care and medical services had been improved and expanded. Much of this was due to Nightingale's influence. In 1874 the first formal nursing training program was started at the General and Marine Hospital in St. Catharines in Ontario.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{complaints}} {{about the use of}} migrant workers, the Act does not require that contractors show that workers engaged are local residents, but rather requires that laborers be paid the local prevailing wage. Due to the way the data were collected at that time and {{due to the fact that}} construction trades were heavily unionized at that time by craft unions, “prevailing wage” effectively meant “union journeyman wage” as discussed above. Unions operate by negotiating for higher wages, and then working to restrict those eligible for the higher wages to union membership. Craft unions did not admit black apprentices, and therefore black laborers did not have the opportunity to advance to journeyman status. According to Bernstein, “as of 1940 blacks composed 19 percent of the 435,000 unskilled [...] "construction laborers" [...] in the United States and 45 percent of the 87,060 in the South”, and according to Hill, [...] "the increase of Negro participation in building trades <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>training</b> programs rose only from 1.5% to 2%" [...] in New York between 1950 and 1960. Furthermore, Hill pointed out that [...] "ecause the National Labor Relations Board has done little to enforce the anti-closed shop provisions of the Taft Hartley Act, building trades unions affiliated to the AFL-CIO in most instances are closed unions operating closed shops". Therefore, the requirements and mechanisms of the Davis–Bacon Act necessarily prevented black laborers from participating in federally funded construction projects. “According to a study on youth and minority employment published by the Congressional Joint Economic Committee on July 6, 1977, Davis–Bacon wage requirements discourage nonunion contractors from bidding on Federal construction work, thus harming minority and young workers who are more likely to work in the nonunionized sector of the construction industry.” Thus, even if racism was not the intent, racial discrimination was a result of the law.|$|E
