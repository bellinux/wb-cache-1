5|$|The {{bird species}} that {{populated}} Lake Cahuilla resembled these around the present-day Salton Sea {{and may have}} contained species from the Gulf of California as well. They include Aechmophorus grebes, <b>American</b> <b>coot,</b> American white pelican, Anas and Aythya ducks, black-crowned night heron, eared grebes, pied-billed grebes and most likely shorebirds.|$|E
5|$|Waterfowl, rails, {{and some}} colonial nesting birds are preyed upon by otters in various areas. Susceptibility {{of these species}} is {{greatest}} during the summer (when waterfowl broods are vulnerable) and autumn. The otters have also been known to catch and consume moulting American wigeon (Mareca americana) and green-winged teal (Anas crecca). Other species of birds found within their diets include: northern pintail (Anas acuta); mallard (Anas platyrhynchos); canvasback (Aythya valisineria); ruddy duck (Oxyura jamaicensis); and the <b>American</b> <b>coot</b> (Fulica americana).|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} birds have been spotted in the Little Butte Creek region. Twenty-two species are known to breed in the {{chaparral}} region, including several species of wrens, blackbirds, and sparrows. The mixed coniferous forest is home to white-headed woodpeckers, pygmy nuthatches, green-tailed towhees, northern pygmy-owls, Vaux's swifts, winter wrens, and MacGillivray's warblers. The <b>American</b> <b>coot</b> has also been spotted in several places along the creek. Williamson's sapsuckers, black-backed woodpeckers, gray jays, and hermit warblers frequent the higher elevations. The near-threatened olive-sided flycatcher and Cassin's finch also live in this area. Eurasian three-toed woodpeckers and Clark's nutcrackers have been spotted near the tree line. The endangered Townsend's big-eared bat is known {{to live in the}} watershed.|$|E
25|$|Much {{research}} has been done on the breeding habits of <b>American</b> <b>coots.</b> Studies have found that mothers will preferentially feed offspring with the brightest plume feathers, a characteristic known as chick ornaments. <b>American</b> <b>coots</b> are also susceptible to conspecific brood parasitism and have evolved mechanisms to identify which offspring are theirs and which are from parasitic females.|$|R
50|$|There {{is also a}} {{great number}} of birds, {{predominantly}} ducks, <b>American</b> <b>coots</b> and hummingbirds.|$|R

25|$|Coot fossils {{from the}} Middle Pleistocene of California have been {{described}} as Fulica hesterna but cannot be separated from the present-day <b>American</b> <b>coot.</b> However, the Pleistocene coot Fulica shufeldti (formerly F. minor), famously known as part of the Fossil Lake fauna, quite possibly was a paleosubspecies of the <b>American</b> <b>coot</b> (as Fulica americana shufeldti) as they only differed marginally in size and proportions from living birds. Thus, it seems that the modern-type American coots evolved during the mid-late Pleistocene, a few hundred thousand years ago.|$|E
25|$|The <b>American</b> <b>coot</b> {{is listed}} as “Least Concern” under the IUCN {{conservation}} ratings. Hunters generally avoid killing American coots because their meat is not as sought after as that of ducks.|$|E

25|$|Birdwatching author William J. Boyle {{reports that}} Swartswood {{is home to}} a {{surprising}} number of waterfowl species, including pied-billed grebe, wood duck, ring-necked duck, ruddy duck, American widgeon, gadwall, <b>American</b> <b>coot</b> and occasionally bald eagle.|$|E
25|$|The <b>American</b> <b>coot</b> is a {{prolific}} builder and will create multiple structures during a single breeding season. It nests in well-concealed locations in tall reeds. There are three general types of structures: display platforms, egg nests and brood nests.|$|E
25|$|The <b>American</b> <b>coot</b> has {{a variety}} of {{repeated}} calls and sounds. Male and female coots make different types of calls to similar situations. Male alarm calls are puhlk while female alarm calls are poonk. Also, stressed males go puhk-cowah or pow-ur while females call cooah.|$|E
50|$|International Bird Rescue {{routinely}} {{cares for}} a variety of species. Among the most commonly treated include brown pelicans, western gulls, northern fulmars, western grebes, <b>American</b> <b>coots,</b> <b>American</b> white pelicans, eared grebes, common murres, Pacific loons, common loons, black-crowned night herons, great blue herons, mallard ducks, and Canada geese.|$|R
25|$|<b>American</b> <b>coots</b> {{are found}} near water reed-ringed lakes and ponds, open marshes, and {{sluggish}} rivers. They prefer freshwater environments but may temporarily live in saltwater environments {{during the winter}} months.|$|R
50|$|Clinical signs {{have been}} {{recorded}} from research studies where individual birds were intentionally infected with the disease and from wild specimens and dead birds recovered from the field. Clinical signs listed are also those observed in <b>American</b> <b>coots.</b>|$|R
25|$|A study {{into the}} {{long-term}} {{effect of the}} oil spill on bird numbers found that certain species, in particular the <b>American</b> <b>coot,</b> had shown a significant decline. However, {{this could have been}} due to external factors, such as that year's occurrence of El Niño, so the overall impact of the spill was deemed impossible to determine.|$|E
25|$|The <b>American</b> <b>coot</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789. A {{member of the}} family Rallidae, it has three subspecies: Fulica americana alai, F. a. caribaea, and F. a. ardesiaca. These subspecies, however, are sometimes considered to be their own separate species. Including these 'subspecies', there are 11 members of the genus Fulica distributed across the globe.|$|E
25|$|The <b>American</b> <b>coot</b> is a {{persistent}} re-nester, and will replace lost clutches with new ones {{within two days}} of clutch-loss during deposition. One study showed that 68% of destroyed clutches are eventually replaced. Re-nested clutches are typically smaller than original clutches by one or two eggs, but this {{could be attributed to}} differences in time and habitat quality instead of food or nutrient reserves and availability.|$|E
50|$|Park {{wildlife}} includes manatees, alligators, white-tailed deer, turtles and otters. Among {{the birds}} {{that can be}} seen are anhingas, egrets, hawks, limpkins, ospreys, vultures, American bald eagles, American white ibis, belted kingfishers, <b>American</b> <b>coots</b> and great blue herons.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} types of {{waterfowl}} and mergansers in the reservoir that migrate during the winter season. Other species include Canada geese, herons, vultures, <b>American</b> <b>coots,</b> swans, and different types of fish, including white perch, yellow perch, and smelts.|$|R
25|$|Since <b>American</b> <b>coots</b> {{build on}} the water, their {{structures}} disintegrate easily and have short life spans. Egg and brood nests are actually elaborate rafts, and must be constantly added {{to in order to}} stay afloat. Females typically do the most work while building.|$|R
25|$|Incubation {{start time}} in the <b>American</b> <b>coot</b> is variable, and can begin {{anywhere}} from the deposition of the first egg to after the clutch is fully deposited. Starting incubation before the entire clutch has been laid is an uncommon practice among birds. Once incubation starts it continues without interruption. Male and female coots share incubation responsibility, but males {{do most of the}} work during the 21-day incubation period. Females will begin to re-nest clutches in an average of six days if clutches are destroyed during incubation.|$|E
25|$|The <b>American</b> <b>coot,</b> {{unlike other}} parasitized species, {{has the ability}} to {{recognize}} and reject conspecific parasitic chicks from their brood. Parents aggressively reject parasite chicks by pecking them vigorously, drowning them, preventing them from entering the nest, etc. They learn to recognize their own chicks by imprinting on cues from the first chick that hatches. The first-hatched chick is a reference to which parents discriminate between later-hatched chicks. Chicks that do not match the imprinted cues are then recognized as parasite chicks and are rejected.|$|E
25|$|Hormones {{that are}} {{passed down from}} the mother into the egg affect {{offspring}} growth, behavior, and social interactions. These nongenetic contributions by the mother are known as maternal effects. In the <b>American</b> <b>coot,</b> two levels of androgen and testosterone variation have been discovered—within-clutch and among-clutch variation. Within the same clutch, eggs laid earlier in the sequence have higher testosterone levels than eggs laid later in the sequence. Females that lay three clutches deposit more androgens into their yolks than females who lay {{only one or two}} clutches.|$|E
50|$|Suwannee River State Park is a Florida State Park {{located near}} Live Oak. It offers {{some of the}} best backcountry canoeing {{opportunities}} in the state. Visitors can see cypress trees, southern magnolia, herons, <b>American</b> <b>coots,</b> turtles and hawks. The park is open year-round.|$|R
50|$|The WMA {{is managed}} for migratory and {{resident}} waterfowl and {{was created to}} enhance waterfowl habitat and production.

25|$|The {{unofficial}} {{symbol of}} Haliburton and Muskoka is the loon, also honoured as Ontario's provincial bird. In addition to loons, other water birds {{on the lake}} include the great blue heron, the great egret, the sandhill crane, and the hooded merganser. Other water birds include {{a wide variety of}} ducks, grebes, bitterns, herons, terns, and mergansers as well as the Canada goose, the double-crested cormorant, the ring-billed and herring gull, the common sandpiper, the killdeer, the common snipe, the Virginia rail, the sora, the <b>American</b> <b>coot,</b> and the common moorhen.|$|E
25|$|The <b>American</b> <b>coot</b> (Fulica americana), {{also known}} as a mud hen, is a bird of the family Rallidae. Though {{commonly}} mistaken to be ducks, American coots belong to a distinct order. Unlike the webbed feet of ducks, coots have broad, lobed scales on their lower legs and toes that fold back with each step in order to facilitate walking on dry land. Coots live near water, typically inhabiting wetlands and open water bodies in North America. Groups of coots are called covers or rafts. The oldest known coot lived to be 22 years old.|$|E
25|$|The <b>American</b> <b>coot</b> is a {{migratory bird}} that {{occupies}} most of North America. It {{lives in the}} Pacific and southwestern United States and Mexico year-round and occupies more northeastern regions during the summer breeding season. In the winter they can be found {{as far south as}} Panama. Coots generally build floating nests and lay 8–12 eggs per clutch. Females and males have similar appearances, but they can be distinguished during aggressive displays by the larger ruff (head plumage) on the male. American coots eat primarily algae and other aquatic plants but also animals (both vertebrates and invertebrates) when available.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the species}} that reside in the park, {{temporarily}} or year-round, include turtles, toads, lizards, bullsnakes, dragonflies, beavers, muskrats, cottontail rabbits, pocket gophers, rock squirrel, coyotes, and numerous birds including Cooper's hawks, great horned owls, <b>American</b> <b>coots,</b> Canada geese, ring-necked pheasants, mallards, wood ducks, black-capped chickadees, great blue herons, northern flickers and woodpeckers.|$|R
40|$|Past nuclear {{activities}} at SRS {{have resulted in}} low level contamination in various wetlands.
