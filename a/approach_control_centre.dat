5000|$|In 1995 Stansted <b>approach</b> <b>control,</b> {{soon after}} to be renamed Essex Radar, moved to West Drayton {{to take their}} place in the TCR. In 2002 Luton <b>approach</b> <b>control</b> also moved in. In the same year, the Area Control {{function}} moved from West Drayton to the new London Area <b>Control</b> <b>Centre</b> (LACC) in Swanwick, Hampshire. The West Drayton facility was renamed the London Terminal <b>Control</b> <b>Centre</b> (LTCC - though still pronounced [...] "latsea") at this time. In 2004, Thames Radar (London City and Biggin Hill radar <b>approach</b> <b>control)</b> moved in from its former home at Heathrow Tower.|$|R
5000|$|In 1992 the Heathrow and Gatwick <b>approach</b> <b>control</b> units {{moved to}} West Drayton to share {{facilities}} with the CCF. The CCF {{and the two}} <b>approach</b> <b>control</b> units were moved into the new Terminal Control room in 1995, and thus became a separate entity to Area Control. To {{reflect the fact that}} there were now two civil control rooms (Area and Terminal) the centre was renamed the London Area and Terminal <b>Control</b> <b>Centre,</b> whilst retaining the same LATCC abbreviation.|$|R
40|$|Detecting and {{reacting}} to critical project states {{in order to}} achieve planned goals is one key issue in performing a software development project successfully and staying competitive as a software development company. Software Cockpits, also known as Software Project <b>Control</b> <b>Centres,</b> support the management and controlling of software and system develop-ment projects and provide a single point of project control. One key element of such cockpits is the analysis, interpretation, and visualisation of measurement data in order to support various stakeholders for different purposes. Currently, many companies develop their own cockpits (typically simple dashboards) that are mainly based on Spreadsheet applications. Alternatively, they use dashboard solutions that provide a fixed set of predefined functions for project control that cannot be sufficiently customised to their own development environ-ment. Most of the more generic <b>approaches</b> for <b>control</b> <b>centres</b> offer only partial solutions and lack purpose-oriented and role-oriented data interpretation and visualisation based on a flexible set of control techniques that can be customised according to planned goals in a cost-efficient way. A systematic approach for defining reusable, customisable control compo-nents and instantiate them according to different organisational goals and characteristics is basically missing. This article gives an overview of the Specula project control framework and illustrates how to employ it for implementing project control mechanisms. The focus is on how to describe and combine control components in a generic way and how to select the right components based on explicitly defined project goals. Furthermore, related approaches are discussed and the use of Specula as part of industrial case studies is described. 1...|$|R
