Flies are important pollinators, second only to the bees and their Hymenopteran relatives. Flies may have been among the evolutionarily earliest pollinators responsible for early plant pollination. Fruit flies are used as model organisms in research, but less benignly, mosquitoes are vectors for malaria, dengue, West Nile fever, yellow fever, encephalitis, and other infectious diseases, and houseflies spread food-borne illnesses. Flies can be <b>annoyances</b> especially in some parts of the world where they can occur in large numbers, buzzing and settling on the skin or eyes to bite or seek fluids. Larger flies such as tsetse flies and screwworms cause significant economic harm to cattle. Blowfly larvae, known as gentles, and other dipteran larvae, known more generally as maggots, are used as fishing bait and as food for carnivorous animals. They are also used in medicine in debridement to clean wounds.|$|E

The noises included the effects of two types of fac¸ade: windows-open and windows-closed. Subjects were exposed to six levels of noise and six magnitudes of vibration, and asked to rate <b>annoyance</b> using an 11 -point numerical scale.

The results show that vibration did not influence ratings of noise <b>annoyance,</b> but that total <b>annoyance</b> caused by combined noise and vibration was considerably greater than the <b>annoyance</b> caused by noise alone. The noise <b>annoyance</b> and the total <b>annoyance</b> caused by combined noise and vibration were associated with subject self-ratings of noise sensitivity.

40|$|<b>Annoyance</b> {{response}} to vehicle noise is commonly reported. The impact reduction measures {{must therefore be}} measured scientifically. A scientific system for describing and defining <b>annoyance</b> is therefore required. There is furthermore a need to reduce the annoying components of the sound of vehicles. The engine of a vehicle {{is one of the}} predominant sources of vehicle noise which cause <b>annoyance.</b> The sounds of engines heard outside of engines at idling, running and accelerating conditions have been reported to cause <b>annoyance</b> throughout the world. This study of sound quality focuses on noise heard outside vehicles, termed external vehicle noise, and which is outside the interior of the car, in free field conditions. The objectives of the study are a) the development of new descriptors and <b>annoyance</b> prediction models at idling and running conditions, b) comparison of several rating methods, c) testing of several recording and reproduction techniques, d) testing of the long-term repeatability of <b>annoyance</b> judgement obtained in tests, and e) comparison of the combustion process of various fuels in terms of <b>annoyance.</b> An <b>annoyance</b> prediction model for idling engine sound was developed using multivariate analysis {{on the basis of a}} new parameter which is termed "Ear Reasoning Range". Two further psychoacoustic descriptors, loudness and impulsiveness were also defined in the model. The sound spectrum which caused least <b>annoyance</b> was obtained by subjective adjustments to an idling engine sound. The quality of the sound was validated by subjective judgements, by test persons, and by objective measurements. An <b>annoyance</b> index for heavy-duty engine noise was developed on the basis of three psychoacoustic descriptors: loudness, sharpness, and harmonic ratio. The model was validated internally and externally and gave good predictions of <b>annoyance</b> judgement of 6 -cylinder inline engine noise. Three rating techniques known as the method of paired comparisons, the method of equal-appearing intervals and the method of successive intervals were investigated with respect to <b>annoyance</b> judgements of engine noise in free field conditions. The method of successive intervals was shown to be useful for <b>annoyance</b> judgements of engine noise for a large number of samples. The <b>annoyance</b> {{response to}} engine sounds recorded by an artificial head did not differ significantly from that recorded by an orthostereophonic technique. The variance in <b>annoyance</b> response for headphone reproduction was higher than that for loundspeaker reproduction. It was found that both recording techniques gave similar predictions of <b>annoyance.</b> Subjects preferred loudspeaker reproduction to headphone reproduction. There was no significant difference in <b>annoyance</b> judgements between experienced and naive listeners. <b>Annoyance</b> judgements of engine noise were shown to be consistent when subjects were asked to judge the same stimuli on two occasions 10 - 20 days apart. A comparison of multivariate analysis and neural networks for modeling <b>annoyance</b> of engine noise in free field conditions was investigated. Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression and Neural Networks were used to develop the <b>annoyance</b> prediction models on the basis of loudness, sharpness and harmonic ratio (rumble noise). PLS regression and Neural Networks gave similar prediction of <b>annoyance</b> for engine noise but neural networks gave greater prediction accuracy than did PLS regression. <b>Annoyance</b> judgements of engine sounds in respect to six different fuels were investigated by forty subjects. The <b>annoyance</b> judgements were found to be consistent with the <b>annoyance</b> index based on loudness, sharpness and harmonic ratio.

40|$|Aircraft noise {{may have}} a number of direct adverse effects on the {{communities}} surrounding airports, including <b>annoyance.</b> The <b>annoyance</b> reactions of individuals and communities to aircraft noise are predicted with <b>annoyance</b> models, which are normally functions of predictor variables that describe the noise exposure. The number of aircraft events that a person is exposed to (the number-of-events), has been hypothesized as a significant contributor to <b>annoyance.</b> However, most models of <b>annoyance</b> to aircraft noise are functions only of the average sound energy of the total noise exposure. The purpose of this research is to quantify the relative effects of sound level and number-of-events in historical noise survey data sets and to develop a survey simulation tool to help in the design of future surveys so that the collected data will be sufficient to compare the performance of proposed <b>annoyance</b> models. The models considered here are DNL and those that are a function of sound level and number-of-events. Seven historical data sets were collected and analyzed individually and in combination. Multiple linear regression models were estimated using the <b>annoyance,</b> sound level, and number-of-events variables in the data sets.

This data allowed us to look in some detail at levels of <b>annoyance</b> from {{aircraft noise}} and influences on levels of <b>annoyance.</b> In this paper we report: • The relative importance of aircraft noise amongst other factors impacting on quality of life • <b>Annoyance</b> from aircraft noise relative to other sources of noise • Reported disturbance of activities and other concerns with respect to aircraft noise • Variations in <b>annoyance</b> levels by time of day • The relationship between <b>annoyance</b> and perceived noise • Models using ordinal regression to explore the relationship between <b>annoyance</b> levels, noise indices and a range of other variables including socio-economic characteristics and contextual variables also self reported exposure to aircraft noise; perceived levels of noise and sensitivity to noise...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} EU-project COSMA (Community Oriented Solutions to Minimize {{aircraft}} noise <b>Annoyance),</b> a telephone study was carried out around Cologne/Bonn Airport {{in order to identify}} the most influencing variables of {{aircraft noise}} induced <b>annoyance.</b> More than 1200 persons from six areas with differing aircraft noise exposure were interviewed. Various acoustical (e. g., LAeq, 6 - 22, LAeq, 22 - 6, flight altitude, predominant type of operation) and non-acoustical variables (e. g,. attitudes, noise sensitivity, noise insulation of home, features of surrounding area) were surveyed for every participant. Aircraft noise <b>annoyance</b> was measured by the semantic 5 -point ICBEN scale. A distinction was made between <b>annoyance</b> in general and <b>annoyance</b> at night. Two multiple regression models showed that the LAeq – extracted in 5 dB(A) -steps from noise contour maps – could explain only a small proportion of variance in the <b>annoyance</b> ratings (16. 5 % for <b>annoyance</b> in general, 17. 9 % for <b>annoyance</b> at night). Including non-acoustical variables into the regression model significantly raised the proportion of explained variance to 54. 8 % and 52. 3 %, resp., whilst integrating further acoustical variables beside the LAeq had no effect. Results are in line with findings of other studies stressing the enormous impact of non-acoustical variables on noise <b>annoyance...</b>|$|R
