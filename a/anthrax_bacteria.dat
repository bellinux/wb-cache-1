Pasteur was told that sheep that died from anthrax were buried in the field. Pasteur thought that earthworms might have brought the bacteria to the surface. He found <b>anthrax</b> <b>bacteria</b> in earthworms' excrement, showing that he was correct. He told the farmers not to bury dead animals in the fields.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2001, {{as soon as}} {{it became}} known that the Ames strain of anthrax had been used in the attacks, {{longtime}} anti-nuclear, anti-biological warfare defense activist Barbara Hatch Rosenberg and others began suggesting that the attack might be the work of a [...] "rogue CIA agent", and they provided the name of the [...] "most likely" [...] person to the FBI. On November 21, 2001, she made similar statements to the Biological and Toxic Weapons convention in Geneva. In December 2001, she published [...] "A Compilation of Evidence and Comments on the Source of the Mailed Anthrax" [...] via the web site of The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) suggesting the attacks were [...] "perpetrated with the unwitting assistance of a sophisticated government program". She discussed the case with reporters from The New York Times. On January 4, 2002, Nicholas Kristof of The New York Times published a column titled [...] "Profile of a Killer" [...] stating [...] "I think I know who sent out the anthrax last fall." [...] For months, Rosenberg gave speeches and stated her beliefs to many reporters from around the world. She posted [...] "Analysis of the Anthrax Attacks" [...] to the FAS web site on January 17, 2002. On February 5, 2002, she published [...] "Is the FBI Dragging Its Feet?" [...] In response, the FBI stated, [...] "There is no prime suspect in this case at this time". The Washington Post reported, [...] "FBI officials over the last week have flatly discounted Dr. Rosenberg's claims". On June 13, 2002, Rosenberg posted [...] "The Anthrax Case: What the FBI Knows" [...] to the FAS site. [...] On June 18, 2002, Rosenberg presented her theories to senate staffers working for Senators Daschle and Leahy. One week later, on June 25, the FBI publicly searched Hatfill's apartment. He becomes a household name. [...] "The FBI also pointed out that Hatfill had agreed to the search and is not considered a suspect." [...] American Prospect and Salon.com report, [...] "Hatfill is not a suspect in the anthrax case, the FBI says." [...] On August 3, 2002, Rosenberg tells the media that the FBI asked her if [...] "a team of government scientists could be trying to frame Steven J. Hatfill". In August 2002, Attorney General John Ashcroft labeled Steven Hatfill a [...] "person of interest" [...] in a press conference, no charges were brought against him. Hatfill, a virologist, vehemently denied he {{had anything to do with}} the <b>anthrax</b> (<b>bacteria)</b> mailings and sued the FBI, the Justice Department, John Ashcroft, Alberto Gonzales, and others for violating his constitutional rights and for violating the Privacy Act. On June 27, 2008, the Department of Justice announced it would settle Hatfill's case for $5.8million.|$|E

5000|$|Bartolomeo Gosio (17 March 1863 - 13 April 1944) was an Italian medical scientist. He {{discovered}} a toxic fume, eponymously named [...] "Gosio gas", which {{is produced by}} microorganisms, that killed many people. He identified the chemical nature of the gas as an arsenic compound (arsine), but incorrectly named it as diethylarsine. He also {{discovered a}}n antibacterial compound called mycophenolic acid from the mould Penicillium brevicompactum. He demonstrated that the novel compound was effective against the deadly <b>anthrax</b> <b>bacterium,</b> Bacillus anthracis. This was the first antibiotic compound isolated in pure and crystallised form. Though the original compound was abandoned in clinical practice due to its adverse effects, its chemical derivative mycophenolate mofetil became the drug of choice as an immunosuppressant in kidney, heart, and liver transplantations.|$|R
50|$|Gosio {{discovered}} a novel antibiotic agent in 1893 from a fungus. He collected the fungus from spoiled corn and named it Penicillium glaucum. (But the species was later renamed P. brevicompactum.) In 1896 he could isolate the crystals of the compound, which he successfully demonstrated as the active antibacterial compound against the <b>anthrax</b> <b>bacterium.</b> This {{was the first}} antibiotic that was isolated in pure and crystallised form. But the discovery was forgotten. It was rediscovered by two American scientists C.L. Alsberg and O.M. Black in 1912, and gave the name mycophenolic acid. The compound was eventually demonstrated to have antiviral, antifungal, antibacterial, anticancer, and antipsoriasis activities. Although it is not commercialised as antibiotic due to its adverse effects, its modified compound (ester derivative) is an approved immunosuppressant drug in kidney, heart, and liver transplantations, and is marketed under the brands CellCept (mycophenolate mofetil; Roche) and Myfortic (mycophenolate sodium; Novartis).|$|R
40|$|To {{mitigate}} {{the effects of}} zoonotic diseases on human and animal populations, {{it is critical to}} understand what factors alter transmission dynamics. Here we assess the risk of exposure to lethal concentrations of the <b>anthrax</b> <b>bacterium,</b> Bacillus anthracis, for grazing animals in a natural system over time through different transmission mechanisms. We follow pathogen concentrations at anthrax carcass sites and waterholes for five years and estimate infection risk as a function of grass, soil or water intake, age of carcass sites, and the exposure required for a lethal infection. Grazing, not drinking, seems the dominant transmission route, and transmission is more probable from grazing at carcass sites 1 - 2 years of age. Unlike most studies of virulent pathogens that are conducted under controlled conditions for extrapolation to real situations, we evaluate exposure risk under field conditions to estimate the probability of a lethal dose, showing that not all reservoirs with detectable pathogens are significant transmission pathways...|$|R

40|$|Macrophages are pivotal {{constituents}} of the innate immune system, vital for recognition and elimination of microbial pathogens(1). Macrophages use Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns - including {{bacterial cell wall}} components, such as lipopolysaccharide or lipoteichoic acid, and viral nucleic acids, such as double-stranded (ds) RNA and in turn activate effector functions, including anti-apoptotic signalling pathways(2). Certain pathogens, however, such as Salmonella spp., Shigellae spp. and Yersiniae spp., use specialized virulence factors to overcome these protective responses and induce macrophage apoptosis(3). We found that the <b>anthrax</b> <b>bacterium,</b> Bacillus anthracis, selectively induces apoptosis of activated macrophages(4) through its lethal toxin, which prevents activation of the anti-apoptotic p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase(4). We now demonstrate that macrophage apoptosis by three different bacterial pathogens depends on activation of TLR 4. Dissection of anti- and pro-apoptotic signalling events triggered by TLR 4 identified the dsRNA responsive protein kinase PKR as a critical mediator of pathogen-induced macrophage apoptosis. The pro-apoptotic actions of PKR are mediated both through inhibition of protein synthesis and activation of interferon response factor 3...|$|R

40|$|Writing about charbon (anthrax) in 1898, the French {{bacteriologist}} Albert Besson {{referred to}} the disease by another name: la maladie de Bradford. The <b>anthrax</b> <b>bacterium</b> - Bacillus anthracis - had arrived in mid-nineteenth-century Bradford on fleeces imported from abroad, and struck down workers in the town's renowned wool industry. Consequently, medical professionals and publics as far afield as Australia and New Zealand associated anthrax with Bradford. Using hitherto little explored archival sources, this thesis examines the origins and development of Bradford's relationship with anthrax at the local, national and global levels. We will look first at local medical research on anthrax in Bradford, concentrating on two local medical practitioners: John Henry Bell and Frederick William Eurich, before considering the role of anthrax in the public life of Bradford, and especially the influences of the local press, which was dominated by the Bradford Observer and Bradford Daily Telegraph. Moving to the national level, the impact of anthrax elsewhere in Britain - particularly Glasgow, Kidderminster and Norfolk - offers instructive comparisons for the Bradford case. The thesis also examines {{the manner in which}} local factory practices were incorporated into national legislation designed to combat anthrax in the wool industry. In the global context, we will see how Continental approaches to anthrax research and prevention were incorporated into British practices, with particular emphasis on the work of Louis Pasteur, Robert Koch and the little-studied but important Italian physician Achille Sclavo and his anti-anthrax serum. Moving beyond Europe, we close by analysing the ways in which anthrax-related information and practices travelled to and from Bradford, concentrating on Turkey, Australia and New Zealand. The thesis sheds new light on the relationship between bacteriological and sanitary approaches to disease prevention, the emergence of the modern understanding of 'anthrax' and the importance of place and locality for histories of disease.

The <b>bacteria</b> sprayed were the less dangerous Bacillus globigii and Escherichia coli, but it was later admitted that the bacteria could adversely affect some vulnerable people. The town of Weymouth lay downwind of the spraying. When the trials became public knowledge in the late 1990s, Dorset County Council, Weymouth and Portland Borough Council and Purbeck District Council demanded a Public Inquiry to investigate the experiments. The Government refused a Public Inquiry but instead commissioned Professor Brian Spratt, to conduct an Independent Review of the possible adverse health effects.

40|$|<b>Anthrax</b> is a <b>bacterium,</b> {{which creates}} spores that can infect the body, {{producing}} lethal poisons and causing death. Anthrax releases three factors: lethal factor (LF), edema factor (EF) and protective antigen (PA). PA and LF form a lethal toxin, which kills macrophages and inhibits B-cell and T-cell function so minimising the immune response to anthrax. Anthrax spores are highly resistant to adverse conditions. It will survive boiling, organic solvents such as ethanol, and high variations of pH. Anthrax infection among heroin users {{is most likely}} to be acquired through: •	Injection - Spores entering the bloodstream, skin or tissues under the skin (such as fat or muscle) via injection of contaminated heroin. •	Inhalation - Smoking/chasing/snorting: Breathing in spores while smoking or snorting contaminated heroin.
