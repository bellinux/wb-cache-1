Al-Rahba was the easternmost fortress of Shirkuh II's Homs-based emirate, {{and was one}} of the four principal centers of the emirate, the other three being Homs itself, Salamiyah and Palmyra. He personally oversaw the demolition of al-Rahba's ruins <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the new fortress.
