5|$|Gerald Fischbach {{spent nine}} {{years at the}} Washington University School of Medicine, where he served as the Edison Professor of Neurobiology and Head of the Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology. During his time here, Fischbach {{continued}} {{his work on the}} ARIA protein. When ARIA isolated from chick embryo brain was applied to chicken myotubes, which are developing chicken muscle fibers, it was shown to increase the rate of insertion of <b>acetylcholine</b> receptors into chicken myotube membranes. This indicated ARIA could play a role in <b>acetylcholine</b> receptor insertion in neuromuscular junctions. Additionally, it was demonstrated that ARIA stimulated the transcription of α <b>acetylcholine</b> receptor subunits leading to an increase in α subunit messenger RNA (mRNA) and precursors, but had no effect on the mRNA levels of the γ or δ <b>acetylcholine</b> receptor subunits. This indicated that the amount α <b>acetylcholine</b> receptor subunit limits the synthesis and subsequent insertion of <b>acetylcholine</b> receptors into chicken myotube membranes.|$|E

5|$|The oldest, {{on which}} most {{currently}} available drug therapies are based, is the cholinergic hypothesis, which proposes that AD {{is caused by}} reduced synthesis of the neurotransmitter <b>acetylcholine.</b> The cholinergic hypothesis has not maintained widespread support, largely because medications intended to treat <b>acetylcholine</b> deficiency have not been very effective. Other cholinergic effects have also been proposed, for example, initiation of large-scale aggregation of amyloid, leading to generalised neuroinflammation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Acetylcholine</b> {{esterase}} inhibition {{has attracted}} the most interest {{as a possible}} therapeutic intervention, with activity varying by a thousandfold between species, and the greatest activity seen in those that contain galantamine or epinorgalanthamine.|$|E
5|$|In normal neuromuscular function, a {{nerve impulse}} is carried down the axon (the long {{projection}} of a nerve cell) from the spinal cord. At the nerve ending in the neuromuscular junction, where the impulse {{is transferred to}} the muscle cell, the nerve impulse leads {{to the opening of}} voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC), the influx of calcium ions into the nerve terminal, and the calcium-dependent triggering of synaptic vesicle fusion with plasma membrane. These synaptic vesicles contain <b>acetylcholine,</b> which is released into the synaptic cleft and stimulates the <b>acetylcholine</b> receptors on the muscle. The muscle then contracts.|$|E
5|$|CMAPs show small amplitudes but normal latency and {{conduction}} velocities. If repeated impulses {{are administered}} (2 per second or 2Hz), it is normal for CMAP amplitudes to become smaller as the <b>acetylcholine</b> in the {{motor end plate}} is depleted. In LEMS, this decrease is larger than observed normally. Eventually, stored <b>acetylcholine</b> is made available, and the amplitudes increase again. In LEMS, this remains insufficient to reach a level sufficient for transmission of an impulse from nerve to muscle; all {{can be attributed to}} insufficient calcium in the nerve terminal. A similar pattern is witnessed in myasthenia gravis. In LEMS, in response to exercising the muscle, the CMAP amplitude increases greatly (over 200%, often much more). This also occurs on the administration of a rapid burst of electrical stimuli (20 impulses per second for 10 seconds). This is attributed to the influx of calcium in response to these stimuli. On single-fiber examination, features may include increased jitter (seen in other diseases of neuromuscular transmission) and blocking.|$|E
5|$|Fischbach {{began his}} {{research}} {{career at the}} National Institutes of Health, where {{he served as a}} senior surgeon at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) before becoming a fellow at the National Institute of Child Health from 1966 to 1973. Much of Fischbach’s research concentrated on the mechanisms controlling action potentials and synapses, from which he pioneered the use of neuron and muscle cell culture to study neuromuscular junctions. Fischbach used this technique to reconstruct neuromuscular junctions from dissociated spinal cord and muscle cells from chick embryos to show that functional synaptic connections reformed and were capable of sending spontaneous or induced action potentials. However, cultures containing isolated spinal cord cells were unable to send similar action potentials. This technique proved to be an important model for further studies to determine the essential mechanisms controlling neuromuscular junction development and maintenance. Towards the end of his tenure at the National Institutes of Health, Fischbach began to search for motor neuron molecules responsible for regulating the number of <b>acetylcholine</b> receptors on postsynaptic cells. This research project culminated in 1993 with the isolation of the ARIA (<b>acetylcholine</b> receptor inducing activity) protein, which {{is a member of the}} neuregulin family and is responsible for stimulating the production of <b>acetylcholine</b> receptors in postsynaptic muscle tissue.|$|E
5|$|In vertebrates, alpha-latrotoxin {{produces}} {{its effect}} through destabilisation of cell membranes and degranulation of nerve terminals, resulting in excessive release of neurotransmitters, namely <b>acetylcholine,</b> norepinephrine and GABA. Excess neurotransmitter activity leads to clinical manifestations of envenomation, although the precise mechanisms {{are not well}} understood. <b>Acetylcholine</b> release accounts for neuromuscular manifestations, and norepinephrine release accounts for the cardiovascular manifestations. Female redbacks have an average of around 0.08–0.10mg of venom, and experiments indicate that the median lethal dose (LD50) for mice at room temperature is 10–20% of this quantity (0.27–0.91mg/kg based on {{the mass of the}} mice used), but that it is considerably more deadly for mice kept at lower or higher temperatures. Pure alpha-latrotoxin has an LD50 in mice of 20–40µg/kg.|$|E
5|$|Many natural poisons act as {{neurotoxins}} {{that can}} cause paralysis leading to death and have functions for defence against predators or in hunting and capturing prey. Some of these natural inhibitors, despite their toxic attributes, are valuable for therapeutic uses at lower doses. An example of a neurotoxin are the glycoalkaloids, from the plant species in the Solanaceae family (includes potato, tomato and eggplant), that are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Inhibition of this enzyme causes an uncontrolled increase in the <b>acetylcholine</b> neurotransmitter, muscular paralysis and then death. Neurotoxicity can also result from the inhibition of receptors; for example, atropine from deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna) that functions as a competitive antagonist of the muscarinic <b>acetylcholine</b> receptors.|$|E
5|$|Of all the alkaloids, only {{galantamine}} {{has made}} it to therapeutic use in man, as the drug galantamine for Alzheimer's disease. Galantamine is an <b>acetylcholine</b> esterase inhibitor which crosses the blood brain barrier and is active within the central nervous system. Daffodils are grown commercially near Brecon in Powys, Wales, to produce galantamine, a drug used to combat Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
5|$|Pyridostigmine {{decreases}} {{the degradation of}} <b>acetylcholine</b> after release into the synaptic cleft, and thereby improves muscle contraction. An older agent, guanidine, causes many side effects and is not recommended. 4-Aminopyridine (dalfampridine), an agent related to 3,4-aminopyridine, causes more side effects than 3,4-DAP and is also not recommended.|$|E
5|$|The lungs are {{supplied}} by nerves of the autonomic nervous system. Input from the {{parasympathetic nervous system}} occurs via the vagus nerve. When stimulated by <b>acetylcholine,</b> this causes constriction of the smooth muscle lining the bronchus and bronchioles, and increases the secretions from glands. The lungs also have a sympathetic tone from norepinephrine acting on the beta 2 receptors in the respiratory tract, which causes bronchodilation.|$|E
5|$|Below and {{in front}} of the {{striatum}} are a number of basal forebrain structures. These include the nucleus accumbens, nucleus basalis, diagonal band of Broca, substantia innominata, and the medial septal nucleus. These structures are important in producing the neurotransmitter, <b>acetylcholine,</b> which is then distributed widely throughout the brain. The basal forebrain, in particular the nucleus basalis, is considered to be the major cholinergic output of the central nervous system to the striatum and neocortex.|$|E
5|$|Diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) {{is shown}} {{as an example}} of an {{irreversible}} protease inhibitor in the figure above right. The enzyme hydrolyses the phosphorus–fluorine bond, but the phosphate residue remains bound to the serine in the active site, deactivating it. Similarly, DFP also reacts with the active site of <b>acetylcholine</b> esterase in the synapses of neurons, and consequently is a potent neurotoxin, with a lethal dose of less than 100mg.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{are found}} in nature and are also {{designed}} and produced as part of pharmacology and biochemistry. Natural poisons are often enzyme inhibitors that have evolved to defend a plant or animal against predators. These natural toxins include {{some of the most}} poisonous compounds known. Artificial inhibitors are often used as drugs, but can also be insecticides such as malathion, herbicides such as glyphosate, or disinfectants such as triclosan. Other artificial enzyme inhibitors block acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme which breaks down <b>acetylcholine,</b> and are used as nerve agents in chemical warfare.|$|E
5|$|Extracts of Narcissus have {{demonstrated}} {{a number of}} potentially useful biological properties including antiviral, prophage induction, antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial, insecticidal, cytotoxic, antitumor, antimitotic, antiplatelet, hypotensive, emetic, <b>acetylcholine</b> esterase inhibitory, antifertility, antinociceptive, chronotropic, pheromone, plant growth inhibitor, and allelopathic. An ethanol extract of Narcissus bulbs was found effective in one mouse model of nociception, para-benzoquinone induced abdominal constriction, but not in another, the hot plate test. Most of these properties are due to alkaloids, but some are also due to mannosa-binding lectins. The most-studied alkaloids in this group are galantamine (galanthamine), lycorine, narciclasine, and pretazettine.|$|E
5|$|Muscarine, {{discovered}} in 1869, was long {{thought to be}} the active hallucinogenic agent in A.muscaria. Muscarine binds with muscarinic <b>acetylcholine</b> receptors leading to the excitation of neurons bearing these receptors. The levels of muscarine in Amanita muscaria are minute when compared with other poisonous fungi such as Inocybe erubescens, the small white Clitocybe species C. dealbata and C. rivulosa. The level of muscarine in A.muscaria is too low {{to play a role in}} the symptoms of poisoning.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific {{electric}} ray and its relatives {{are used as}} model organisms for biomedical research, because their electric organs contain an abundance of important nervous system proteins such as nicotinic <b>acetylcholine</b> receptor and acetylcholinesterase. In the 1970s and 1980s, <b>acetylcholine</b> receptors from this species and the marbled {{electric ray}} (T.marmorata) became the first neurotransmitter receptors to be isolated and sequenced, in what {{is considered to be}} a landmark success in the field of neurobiology. This led to a number of further advances, one of the most significant being the elucidation of the pathophysiology underlying the disease myasthenia gravis. A small commercial fishery in southern California supplies Pacific electric rays for research purposes; as of 2005 this fishery may have employed as few as two fishers. Otherwise, this ray has no economic value. It is caught incidentally by commercial trawl and gillnet fisheries, and on hook-and-line by sport anglers. These activities appear to have little impact on its population, leading it to be listed under Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Fishing for this ray is not managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council.|$|E
5|$|The shock {{from the}} Japanese sleeper ray is strong but not {{life-threatening}} to humans. There is an observation of a ray that reacted to being touched {{with a camera}} by rubbing its back against the camera port, suggesting that it may actively defend itself if disturbed. The Japanese sleeper ray adapts poorly to captivity. This and other species of electric rays are used in biomedical research because their electric organs have an abundance of ion channels and <b>acetylcholine</b> receptors, and {{can serve as a}} model for the human nervous system.|$|E
5|$|The shock {{from the}} ocellated {{electric}} ray is not dangerous to humans. It occasionally {{appears in the}} home aquarium trade, but is difficult to keep because it requires live invertebrates for food. The ocellated electric ray and other electric rays are used as model organisms in biomedical research because their electric organs are rich in ion channels and <b>acetylcholine</b> receptors, which play important roles in the human nervous system. The protein agrin, which concentrates <b>acetylcholine</b> receptors during human embryonic development, was first isolated from this species. Though the ocellated electric ray is not utilized economically, it is caught incidentally by shrimp trawlers. Its mortality from fishing has not been quantified but {{is thought to be}} high, considering that trawling operations in the Atlantic are known to take Diplobatis species in large numbers. The catch rate is also probably underestimated due to problematic identification. Given the restricted range of this species and the intensity of trawling within its habitat, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|There {{are dozens}} of other {{chemical}} neurotransmitters {{that are used in}} more limited areas of the brain, often areas dedicated to a particular function. Serotonin, for example—the primary target of antidepressant drugs and many dietary aids—comes exclusively from a small brainstem area called the raphe nuclei. Norepinephrine, which is involved in arousal, comes exclusively from a nearby small area called the locus coeruleus. Other neurotransmitters such as <b>acetylcholine</b> and dopamine have multiple sources in the brain, but are not as ubiquitously distributed as glutamate and GABA.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{preclinical}} {{research with}} animal and human proteins, bupropion {{has been characterized}} as a weak norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It has also been found {{to act as a}} releasing agent of dopamine and norepinephrine (NDRA), similarly to other cathinones. However, when ingested orally by humans, bupropion is extensively converted in the body into several active metabolites with differing activities and influences on the effects of the drug during first-pass metabolism. These metabolites are present in much higher concentrations in the body compared to bupropion itself. The most important example is the major metabolite of bupropion, hydroxybupropion, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (and likely releasing agent) and nicotinic <b>acetylcholine</b> receptor (nAChR) antagonist that lacks significant dopaminergic actions, and which, with oral bupropion treatment, can reach area under the curve (AUC) plasma concentrations that are as much as 16–20times greater than those of bupropion itself. Hence, the effects of bupropion cannot be understood unless its metabolism is also considered.|$|E
5|$|Sleep {{involves}} great {{changes in}} brain activity. Until the 1950s {{it was generally}} believed that the brain essentially shuts off during sleep, but this is now known to be far from true; activity continues, but patterns become very different. There {{are two types of}} sleep: REM sleep (with dreaming) and NREM (non-REM, usually without dreaming) sleep, which repeat in slightly varying patterns throughout a sleep episode. Three broad types of distinct brain activity patterns can be measured: REM, light NREM and deep NREM. During deep NREM sleep, also called slow wave sleep, activity in the cortex takes the form of large synchronized waves, whereas in the waking state it is noisy and desynchronized. Levels of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin drop during slow wave sleep, and fall almost to zero during REM sleep; levels of <b>acetylcholine</b> show the reverse pattern.|$|E
5|$|The marbled {{electric}} ray is caught incidentally in bottom trawls, trammel nets, and bottom longlines; it has little economic value and is mostly discarded at sea when captured. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks enough population and fishery data to assess its conservation status beyond Data Deficient. At least in the northern Mediterranean, surveys have found that it remains the most common {{electric ray}}, and is perhaps becoming more abundant in Italian waters. This and other electric ray species are used as model organisms in biomedical research because their electric organs are rich in <b>acetylcholine</b> receptors, which {{play an important role}} in the human nervous system.|$|E
5|$|After {{his time}} at the National Institutes of Health, Fischbach {{obtained}} a position as {{an associate professor at}} Harvard Medical School's Department of Pharmacology in 1973. By 1978 he obtained tenure and became a full professor, and continued teaching at Harvard University for the next three years. After a nine-year stint at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, he returned to Harvard to serve as the Nathan Marsh Pusey Professor of Neurobiology and Chairman of the Neurobiology Departments of both Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital from 1990 to 1998. During his years as an associate professor, he researched the development of precursor muscle cells, specifically the development of <b>acetylcholine</b> receptors on embryonic chick pectoral muscles. Later on he continued his research on ARIA that he started at the National Institutes of Health, specifically focusing on the expression of the protein's isoforms and their effects on tyrosine kinases. In 1993, Fischbach was involved with the founding of the Mind, Brain, Behavior Institute. This inter-disciplinary program aims to research the different structures, evolution, and development of the nervous system in order to better understand human behavior.|$|E
5|$|Brain {{activity}} {{is made possible}} by the interconnections of neurons that are linked together to reach their targets. A neuron consists of a cell body, axon, and dendrites. Dendrites are often extensive branches that receive information in the form of signals from the axon terminals of other neurons. The signals received may cause the neuron to initiate an action potential (an electrochemical signal or nerve impulse) which is sent along its axon to the axon terminal, to connect with the dendrites or with the cell body of another neuron. An action potential is initiated at the initial segment of an axon, which contains a complex of proteins. When an action potential, reaches the axon terminal it triggers the release of a neurotransmitter at a synapse that propagates a signal that acts on the target cell. These chemical neurotransmitters include dopamine, serotonin, GABA, glutamate, and <b>acetylcholine.</b> GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, and glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter. Neurons link at synapses to form pathways and elaborate neural networks, and the activity between them is driven by the process of neurotransmission.|$|E
5|$|Reduction in the {{activity}} of the cholinergic neurons is a well-known feature of Alzheimer's disease. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are employed to reduce the rate at which <b>acetylcholine</b> (ACh) is broken down, thereby increasing the concentration of ACh in the brain and combating the loss of ACh caused by the death of cholinergic neurons. There is evidence for the efficacy of these medications in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, and some evidence for their use in the advanced stage. Only donepezil is approved for treatment of advanced AD dementia. The use of these drugs in mild cognitive impairment has not shown any effect in a delay of the onset of AD. The most common side effects are nausea and vomiting, both of which are linked to cholinergic excess. These side effects arise in approximately 10–20% of users, are mild to moderate in severity, and can be managed by slowly adjusting medication doses. Less common secondary effects include muscle cramps, decreased heart rate (bradycardia), decreased appetite and weight, and increased gastric acid production.|$|E
5|$|There is no antidote, and {{supportive}} care is {{the mainstay of}} further treatment for intoxication. Though {{sometimes referred to as}} a deliriant and while muscarine was first isolated from A. muscaria and as such is its namesake, muscimol does not have action, either as an agonist or antagonist, at the muscarinic <b>acetylcholine</b> receptor site, and therefore atropine or physostigmine as an antidote is not recommended. If a patient is delirious or agitated, this can usually be treated by reassurance and, if necessary, physical restraints. A benzodiazepine such as diazepam or lorazepam can be used to control combativeness, agitation, muscular overactivity, and seizures. Only small doses should be used, as they may worsen the respiratory depressant effects of muscimol. Recurrent vomiting is rare, but if present may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances; intravenous rehydration or electrolyte replacement may be required. Serious cases may develop loss of consciousness or coma, and may need intubation and artificial ventilation. Hemodialysis can remove the toxins, although this intervention is generally considered unnecessary. With modern medical treatment the prognosis is typically good following supportive treatment.|$|E
25|$|The inhaled {{nicotine}} mimics nicotinic <b>acetylcholine</b> which when {{bound to}} nicotinic <b>acetylcholine</b> receptors prevents the reuptake of <b>acetylcholine</b> thereby increasing that neurotransmitter {{in those areas}} of the body. These nicotinic <b>acetylcholine</b> receptors {{are located in the}} central nervous system and at the nerve-muscle junction of skeletal muscles; whose activity increases heart rate, alertness, and faster reaction times. Nicotine <b>acetylcholine</b> stimulation is not directly addictive. However, since dopamine-releasing neurons are abundant on nicotine receptors, dopamine is released; and, in the nucleus accumbens, dopamine is associated with motivation causing reinforcing behavior. Dopamine increase, in the prefrontal cortex, may also increase working memory.|$|E
25|$|A nicotinic agonist is a {{drug that}} mimics the action of <b>acetylcholine</b> (ACh) at nicotinic <b>acetylcholine</b> receptors (nAChRs). The nAChR is named for its {{affinity}} for nicotine.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} cation–π {{interactions}} in molecular recognition {{is seen in}} the nicotinic <b>acetylcholine</b> receptor (nAChR) which binds its endogenous ligand, <b>acetylcholine</b> (a positively charged molecule), via a cation–π interaction to the quaternary ammonium. The nAChR neuroreceptor is a well-studied ligand-gated ion channel that opens upon <b>acetylcholine</b> binding. <b>Acetylcholine</b> receptors are therapeutic targets for a large host of neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, depression and autism. Studies by Dougherty and coworkers confirmed that cation-π interactions are important for binding and activating nAChR by making specific structural variations to a key tryptophan residue and correlating activity results with cation-π binding ability.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acetylcholine</b> {{has been}} implicated in {{learning}} and memory in several ways. The anticholinergic drug, scopolamine, impairs acquisition of new information in humans and animals. In animals, disruption of the supply of <b>acetylcholine</b> to the neocortex impairs the learning of simple discrimination tasks, comparable to the acquisition of factual information and disruption of the supply of <b>acetylcholine</b> to the hippocampus and adjacent cortical areas produces forgetting comparable to anterograde amnesia in humans.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acetylcholine</b> (ACh) is {{an organic}} {{chemical}} that {{functions in the}} brain and body of many types of animals, including humans, as a neurotransmitter—a chemical released by nerve cells to send signals to other cells. Its name is derived from its chemical structure: it is an ester of acetic acid and choline. Parts in the body that use or are affected by <b>acetylcholine</b> are referred to as cholinergic. Substances that interfere with <b>acetylcholine</b> activity are called anticholinergics.|$|E
25|$|The disease {{myasthenia}} gravis, {{characterized by}} muscle weakness and fatigue, {{occurs when the}} body inappropriately produces antibodies against <b>acetylcholine</b> nicotinic receptors, and thus inhibits proper <b>acetylcholine</b> signal transmission. Over time, the motor end plate is destroyed. Drugs that competitively inhibit acetylcholinesterase (e.g., neostigmine, physostigmine, or primarily pyridostigmine) are effective in treating this disorder. They allow endogenously released <b>acetylcholine</b> more time to interact with its respective receptor before being inactivated by acetylcholinesterase in the synaptic cleft (the space between nerve and muscle).|$|E
25|$|The axon of an α-MN {{connects with}} its extrafusal muscle fiber via a neuromuscular junction, a {{specialized}} type of chemical synapse that differs both in {{structure and function}} from the chemical synapses that connect neurons to each other. Both types of synapses rely on neurotransmitters to transduce the electrical signal into a chemical signal and back. One way they differ is that synapses between neurons typically use glutamate or GABA as their neurotransmitters, while the neuromuscular junction uses <b>acetylcholine</b> exclusively. <b>Acetylcholine</b> is sensed by nicotinic <b>acetylcholine</b> receptors on extrafusal muscle fibers, causing their contraction.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acetylcholine</b> {{receptor}} is a receptor {{linked to}} a cation channel. The protein consists of 4 subunits: α, β, γ, and δ subunits. There are two α subunits, with one <b>acetylcholine</b> binding site each. This receptor can exist in three conformations. The closed and unoccupied state is the native protein conformation. As two molecules of <b>acetylcholine</b> both bind to the binding sites on α subunits, the conformation of the receptor is altered and the gate is opened, allowing for the entry of many ions and small molecules. However, this open and occupied state only lasts for a minor duration and then the gate is closed, becoming the closed and occupied state. The two molecules of <b>acetylcholine</b> will soon dissociate from the receptor, returning it to the native closed and unoccupied state.|$|E
