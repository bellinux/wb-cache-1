5|$|Gliese 876 b {{currently}} {{lies beyond}} {{the outer edge}} of the habitable zone but because Gliese 876 is a slowly evolving main-sequence red dwarf its habitable zone is very slowly moving outwards <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so for trillions of years. Therefore, Gliese 876 b will, in trillions of years time, lie inside Gliese 876's habitable zone, as defined by the ability of an Earth-mass planet to retain liquid water at its surface, and remain there for at least 4.6 billion years. While the prospects for life on a gas giant are unknown, large moons may be able to support a habitable environment. Models of tidal interactions between a hypothetical moon, the planet and the star suggest that large moons should be able to survive in orbit around Gliese 876 b for the lifetime of the system. On the other hand, it is unclear whether such moons could form in the first place. However, the large mass of the gas giant may make it more likely for larger moons to form.|$|E

25|$|Likewise, Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, {{the founder}} of the Jewish Renewal movement, views God as a process.

500|$|Public {{reception}} to the IAU {{decision was}} mixed. Many accepted the reclassification, but some sought {{to overturn the}} decision with online petitions urging the IAU to consider reinstatement.

The New Mexico House of Representatives passed a resolution in honor of Tombaugh, a longtime resident of that state, that declared that Pluto will always be considered a planet while in New Mexican skies and that March 13, 2007, was Pluto Planet Day. The Illinois Senate passed a similar resolution in 2009, on the basis that Clyde Tombaugh, the discoverer of Pluto, was born in Illinois. The resolution asserted that Pluto was [...] "unfairly downgraded to a 'dwarf' planet" [...] by the IAU." [...] Some members of the public have also rejected the change, citing the disagreement within the scientific community on the issue, or for sentimental reasons, maintaining that they have always known Pluto as a planet <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so regardless of the IAU decision.|$|E
