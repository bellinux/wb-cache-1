He says they should try as it will increase her chances of a release. She relents, at first, but agrees and he shows her slides of nude women to aid her repulsion. He then brings in a male patient and has Lana touch both the patient and herself in sexual manner. She cannot complete this form of therapy. Thredson later promises Lana that he will take her with him when his asylum visit is over in a week.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, the {{treatment}} outcome research has consistently shown {{that there are}} effective treatment approaches for alcohol problems. These approaches include brief inter-ventions and motivational interviewing, social skills training, community reinforcement, behavior contracting, relapse prevention and some <b>aversion</b> <b>therapies.</b> The commonality among these treatment approaches is the focus on actively engaging the client in the processes of suppressing use and teaching alternative coping skills. Research has also indicated {{that some of the}} more typical US treatment components are not effective and often show no improvement or worse outcomes when compared to well-articulated interventions. Pharmacologic agents that suppress the desire to drink have shown promise in reducing alcohol consumption. Naltrexone, an opiate receptor antagonist, has demonstrated effective-ness in several well-controlled studies. Withdrawal medications, psychiatric agents, and disul-firam show more limited effectiveness in US populations. There are a number of additional factors to consider when determining treatment effec-tiveness. Comorbidity of psychiatric diagnoses often complicates the picture and calls for a broader focus.

Nevertheless, Edwards won a $3.7 million verdict on behalf of his client, who had suffered permanent brain and nerve damage after a doctor prescribed an overdose of the anti-alcoholism drug Antabuse during alcohol <b>aversion</b> <b>therapy.</b> In other cases, Edwards sued the American Red Cross three times, alleging transmission of AIDS through tainted blood products, resulting in a confidential settlement each time, and defended a North Carolina newspaper against a libel charge.|$|E
25|$|June – Under {{the name}} , the first Affirmation group was {{organized}} on 11 June in Salt Lake City by Stephan Zakharias (formerly Stephen James Matthew Prince) {{and a group}} of other Mormon and former-Mormon gays and lesbians at the conference for the Salt Lake Coalition for Human Rights. Stephan organized the group in response to the suicides of two BYU friends who had undergone shock <b>aversion</b> <b>therapy</b> on the campus. The original organization struggled to survive until 1978, when Paul Mortensen, inspired by an article on the group in The Advocate formed the Los Angeles chapter, and in 1980 the name was changed to Affirmation: Gay & Lesbian Mormons. Through the influence of the Los Angeles chapter, Affirmation groups began appearing in many cities around the US.|$|E
25|$|Alex {{is convicted}} of murder and sentenced to 14 years in prison (Pete visiting one day {{informed}} him that Georgie has {{been killed in a}} botched robbery). Two years into his term, he has obtained a job in one of the prison chapels playing religious music on the stereo to accompany the Sunday religious services. The chaplain mistakes Alex's Bible studies for stirrings of faith; in reality, Alex is only reading Scripture for the violent passages. After his fellow cellmates blame him for beating a troublesome cellmate to death, he is chosen to undergo an experimental behaviour-modification treatment called the Ludovico Technique in exchange for having the remainder of his sentence commuted. The technique is a form of <b>aversion</b> <b>therapy,</b> in which Alex is injected with nausea-inducing drugs while watching graphically violent films, eventually conditioning him to become severely ill at the mere thought of violence. As an unintended consequence, the soundtrack to one of the films, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, renders Alex unable to enjoy his beloved classical music as before.|$|E
50|$|A {{study in}} 1991 showed that {{behavior}} modification {{was effective in}} sex offender treatment and covert sensitization, {{and it has been}} shown to have some effects on reducing recidivism. However Gene Able, who has done extensive research in this area, suggests that it is not as effective outside of the package which contains odor <b>aversion,</b> satiation <b>therapy</b> (mastubatory reconditioning), and various social skills training programs including empathy training. Current behavior analysis programs offer this type of comprehensive treatment approach. In addition they use a combination of functional assessment, behavior chain analysis and risk assessment to create relapse prevention strategies and to help the offender to develop better self-control.|$|R

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) Approaches {{to gender}} {{diversity}} in Western culture {{have had a}} chequered past. Gender-variant children have been institutionalised, subjected to <b>aversion</b> <b>therapies</b> and pressured into maintaining secrecy and conforming to society’s gendered expectations while also dealing with bullying and harassment at school. Gender-variant adults struggle {{with a lack of}} acceptance and live in fear of violence and discrimination {{while at the same time}} dealing with the legacy of their childhood. Parents of gender-variant children are forced to contend with societal bias and assumptions that allow their children to be marginalised. Moreover, they have scarce resources to help them manage their child’s welfare and deal with their concerns on a day-to-day basis. The idea of gender variance confronts widely held assumptions that children born as male will act like ‘boys’ and children born as female will act like ‘girls’. This imposed binary perpetuates negativity towards people who express themselves with gendered variations in attire, behaviour or preferences. Despite the existence of cross-gender presentations and behaviour in every culture and throughout time, society still appears to be unaware that diversity in gender expression and sexual formation is a naturally occurring phenomenon. Previous research on gender-variant children has largely been focussed on the etiology and treatments of gender identity disorder, investigating demographics, heritability, co-morbid conditions, gender development, and genetic and environmental influences. However, current research within the social sciences draws attention to a range of gender variance topics such as: the challenges and inequalities affecting children presenting with gender diversity; their victimisation; their social transitions; and professionals’ use of language in referring to gender variance. Research studies on the parents of gender-variant children have generally utilised parent-reports on gender identity questionnaires relating to their child. Recent studies have explored parents’ stories and mental health ratings of their child as well as their emotions and attitudes towards their child. Combined child and parent reports have focussed on therapeutic support procedures and outcomes for parents and families with gender-variant children. These studies contribute important information that aids in the diagnosis of gender identity disorder and work continues towards suitable approaches for the support of these children and their parents. However, much of the evidence provided thus far is anecdotal and interventions are based on little or no evidence. Anecdotal reports, although important contributions to understanding individual circumstances, tend to privilege certain viewpoints. By establishing the needs of gender-variant children and their parents, this qualitative enquiry aims to contribute to research-based evidence and the development of supportive programs, training and policies. This study brings into the open forum some of the challenges that children with gender variance and their parents face, identifies ways in which the children and their parents are marginalised and explores how they cope. Evidence is provided so as to inform the practices, interventions and recommendations relied upon in supporting gender-variant children and their families. This research was conducted through three Internet surveys which used open-ended questions to provide a rich source of thick description of personal experiences. These questions enabled a thematic and reflective analysis of data sourced from the experiences of parents raising a gender-variant child, the childhood experiences (retrospective) of transgender adults, and the views of professionals who work with the transgender community. The results of this study indicate a severe lack of resources and access to professional help for gender-variant children and their parents. The needs of the children emerged as: the need to be heard and accepted by their parents without punishment; the need for information and peer contact; the need for personal gender expression; and the need for safety. The most common needs for parents were for information in the way of stories, research and guidelines as well as educational resources to prepare schools, professionals and local communities for providing trans-positive support for them and their child. Other identified needs of the parents addressed support from community, professionals, peers and governments. The goals of this project include the promotion of trans-positive approaches, and awareness and education regarding bullying and ostracism of gender-variant children. Outcomes are suggested in the form of recommendations and training policies for professionals, governments, schools and parents. These suggestions aim to reduce the debilitating experiences and outcomes that gender-variant adolescents and adults have to endure. This study of the needs of gender-variant children and their parents relies upon the voices of those in the community and fills a void in the current understanding and treatment of gender non-conforming children. The identification of these needs provides fundamental information for the development and application of resources and services that will foster positive mental health for gender-variant children during their formative years...|$|R

2500|$|Burroughs left Paris for London in 1960 {{to visit}} Dr. Dent, a {{well-known}} English medical doctor who spearheaded a reputedly painless heroin withdrawal treatment using the drug apomorphine. Dent's apomorphine cure {{was also used}} to treat alcoholism, although it was held by several people who undertook it {{to be no more}} than straightforward <b>aversion</b> <b>therapy.</b> Burroughs however was convinced. Following his first cure, he wrote a detailed appreciation of apomorphine and other cures, which he submitted to The British Journal of Addiction (Vol. 53, 1956) under the title [...] "Letter From A Master Addict To Dangerous Drugs"; this letter is appended to many editions of Naked Lunch.|$|E
2500|$|The {{primary side}} effects of the drug are gastrointestinal-related, and include {{steatorrhea}} (oily, loose stools with excessive flatus due to unabsorbed fats reaching the large intestine), fecal incontinence and frequent or urgent bowel movements. GlaxoSmithKline recommends that all users be cautious of the possible side effects until they [...] "have a sense of any treatment effects". To minimize these effects, foods with high fat content should be avoided; the manufacturer advises consumers to follow a low-fat, reduced-calorie diet. Oily stools and flatulence can be controlled by reducing the dietary fat content to somewhere {{in the region of}} 15grams per meal. The manual for Alli makes it clear that orlistat treatment involves <b>aversion</b> <b>therapy,</b> encouraging the user to associate eating fat with unpleasant treatment effects.|$|E
2500|$|Behavior-based {{treatment}} options {{can be useful}} for developmentally disabled and mentally ill individuals with pica. These may involve using positive reinforcement normal behavior. Many use <b>aversion</b> <b>therapy,</b> where the patient learns through positive reinforcement which foods are good and which ones they should not eat. Often treatment {{is similar to the}} treatment of obsessive compulsive or addictive disorders (such as exposure therapy). In some cases treatment is as simple as addressing the fact they have this disorder and why they may have it. A recent study classified nine such classes of behavioral intervention: [...] Success with treatment is generally high and generally fades with age, but it varies depending on the cause of the disorder. Developmental causes tend to have a lower success rate. Pregnancy craving causes tend to have higher success rates.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was also}} used as a private {{treatment}} of heroin addiction, a purpose {{for which it was}} championed by the author William S. Burroughs. Burroughs and others claimed that it was a [...] "metabolic regulator" [...] with a restorative dimension to a damaged or dysfunctional dopaminergic system. There is more than enough anecdotal evidence to suggest that this offers a plausible route to an abstinence based model; however, no clinical trials have ever tested this hypothesis. A recent study indicates that apomorphine might be a suitable marker for assessing central dopamine system alterations associated with chronic heroin consumption. There is, however, no clinical evidence that apomorphine is an effective and safe treatment regimen for opiate addiction. [...] Early studies involved <b>aversion</b> <b>therapy</b> in alcoholism and anxiety, and modern reports are anecdotal, although some practitioners claimed to be using non-aversive methods.|$|E
2500|$|One case of {{emancipation}} involved Lyn Duff.

On May 19, 1992, after 168 days of incarceration, Duff escaped from Rivendell and traveled to San Francisco, where she lived {{on the streets and}} in safe houses.

2500|$|October – Robert L.

Blattner served as a {{special assistant to the}} LDS Commissioner of Personal Welfare Victor L.

He also says homosexual behavior and alcoholism are similar. He is asked what [...] "the church's feelings are about electric shock ... behavior modification" [...] and answered the church had [...] "never made a statement on it" [...] but that [...] "most people coming to us can be helped by it" [...] in reference to <b>aversion</b> <b>therapy</b> research happening at BYU.|$|E
2500|$|Although Rivendell was {{not officially}} {{affiliated}} with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Duff later {{said that she}} was visited by Mormon missionaries during her six months at the Utah psychiatric facility and that the treatment she received was heavily influenced by religion. Duff says that Rivendell therapists told her that a gay and lesbian orientation was caused by negative experiences with people of the opposite gender and that having a lesbian sexual identity would lead to sexually abusing other people or engaging in bestiality. Duff was diagnosed with Gender Identity Disorder (GID) and clinical depression. Duff was subjected to a regimen of conversion therapy. This involved <b>aversion</b> <b>therapy,</b> which consisted of being forced to watch same-sex pornography while smelling ammonia. She was also subjected to hypnosis, psychotropic drugs, solitary confinement, and therapeutic messages linking lesbian sex with [...] "the pits of hell". Behavior modification techniques were also used including: requiring girls to wear dresses, unreasonable forms of punishment for small infractions similar to hazing like having to cut the lawn with small scissors and scrubbing floors with a toothbrush and [...] "positive peer pressure" [...] group sessions in which patients demeaned and belittled each other for both real and perceived inadequacies.|$|E
2500|$|His dystopian novel A Clockwork Orange was {{published}} in 1962. It was inspired initially by an incident during the Second World War in which his wife Lynne was robbed, assaulted and violated by deserters from the US Army in London during the blackout. The event {{may have contributed to}} her subsequent miscarriage. The book was an examination of free will and morality. The young anti-hero, Alex, captured after a short career of violence and mayhem, undergoes a course of <b>aversion</b> <b>therapy</b> treatment to curb his violent tendencies. This results in making him defenceless against other people and unable to enjoy some of his favourite music that, besides violence, had been an intense pleasure for him. In the non-fiction book Flame into Being (1985) Burgess described A Clockwork Orange as [...] "a jeu d'esprit knocked off for money in three weeks, it became known as the raw material for a film which seemed to glorify sex and violence." [...] He added [...] "the film made it easy for readers of the book to misunderstand what it was about, and the misunderstanding will pursue me till I die." [...] Near the time of publication the final chapter was cut from the American edition of the book. Burgess had written A Clockwork Orange with twenty-one chapters, meaning to match the age of majority. [...] "21 is the symbol of human maturity, or used to be, since at 21 you got to vote and assumed adult responsibility," [...] Burgess wrote in a foreword for a 1986 edition. Needing money and thinking that the publisher was [...] "being charitable in accepting the work at all," [...] Burgess accepted the deal and allowed A Clockwork Orange to be published in the US with the twenty-first chapter omitted. Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation of A Clockwork Orange was based on the American edition, and thus helped to perpetuate the loss of the last chapter.|$|E
