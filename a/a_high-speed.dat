5|$|High-speed USB2.0 hubs contain devices called {{transaction}} translators that convert between high-speed USB2.0 {{buses and}} full and low speed buses. When <b>a</b> <b>high-speed</b> USB2.0 hub is plugged into <b>a</b> <b>high-speed</b> USB host or hub, it operates in high-speed mode. The USB hub then uses either one transaction translator per hub {{to create a}} full/low-speed bus routed to all full and low speed devices on the hub, or uses one transaction translator per port to create an isolated full/low-speed bus per port on the hub.|$|E

5|$|For anejaculation in SCI, the {{first-line}} {{method for}} sperm retrieval is penile vibratory stimulation (PVS). <b>A</b> <b>high-speed</b> vibrator {{is applied to}} the glans penis to trigger a reflex that causes ejaculation, usually within a few minutes. Reports of efficacy with PVS range from 15–88%, possibly due to differences in vibrator settings and experience of clinicians, as well as level and completeness of injury. Complete lesions strictly above Onuf's nucleus (S2–S4) are responsive to PVS in 98%, but complete lesions of the S2–S4 segments are not.|$|E
