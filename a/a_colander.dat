5|$|Further {{changes were}} made to the {{techniques}} used. Each morning, 36 chickens were roasted for their juices rather than the meat being used on the menu. Each chicken was pressed in <b>a</b> <b>colander</b> to ensure that all the liquid was expressed. These juices were mixed with those from the roasting trays after they had been deglazed with Madeira wine and then added a small amount of veal stock. The actual roasted chickens ended up being too dry to serve following the process, and so were used for staff lunches or were discarded. These 36 chickens produced enough juice for the sauces to accompany 30 chicken dishes. Similar processes were conducted with lamb shoulders, where they were pressed only for the creation of sauces.|$|E
25|$|In the {{two-stage}} or two-bath method, {{the first}} bath, sometimes called blanching, is in hot fat (around 160°C / 320°F) to cook them through. This may {{be done in}} advance. Then they are more briefly fried in very hot fat (190°C / 375°F) to crisp the exterior. They are then placed in <b>a</b> <b>colander</b> or on a cloth to drain, salted, and served. The exact times of the two baths depend {{on the size of}} the potatoes. For example, for 2–3mm strips, the first bath takes about 3 minutes, and the second bath takes only seconds.|$|E
25|$|The {{flying boat}} squadrons {{operating}} from Pembroke Dock, were occupied with {{a myriad of}} tasks during the Second World War. Principal among these was Air Sea Rescue (ASR) with which most aircraft were equipped with Lindholme Gear for dropping into the sea for downed aircrews. The squadron also had responsibility for convoy escort duties in the Atlantic and also as hunter killers in Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW). On 2 June 1943, a Short Sunderland of No 461 Squadron (11 Crew, 9 Australian, 2 British) was attacked whilst on an ASR patrol over the Bay of Biscay by 8 Junkers 88 fighter aircraft. The Sunderland had been searching the Bay of Biscay area for a downed BOAC aircraft that had been shot down over that area the previous day (and included amongst its passenger manifest the actor Leslie Howard) when it was attacked by the Luftwaffe. The crew managed to down three of the enemy aircraft, but limped home with an airframe like <b>a</b> <b>colander</b> due to the strafing bullet runs that the Junkers 88s had taken against it. The aircraft was landed hard at Praa Sands in Cornwall and whilst most of the crew were injured, {{there was only one}} fatality. The tide destroyed the airframe the next day.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Austrian economists {{today have}} a {{valuable}} opportunity to rejoin the mainstream of the economics profession. <b>As</b> <b>Colander,</b> Holt, and Rosser have argued, neoclassical orthodoxy is no long mainstream.

50|$|David <b>Colander,</b> <b>an</b> {{advocate}} of complexity economics, {{argues that the}} ideas of heterodox economists are now being discussed in the mainstream without mention of the heterodox economists, because the tools to analyze institutions, uncertainty, and other factors have now been developed by the mainstream. He suggests that heterodox economists should embrace rigorous mathematics and attempt to work from within the mainstream, rather than treating it as an enemy.|$|R
5000|$|A zaru (...) is a {{draining}} basket made from bamboo {{used in the}} preparation and presentation of Japanese cuisine. It {{can be used in}} a similar fashion to <b>a</b> sieve or <b>colander,</b> both of which are common in western cooking. Additionally, well-designed zaru are used to present food directly, as for example zarusoba. Plastic and metal versions of the zaru have also come into use, but are rarely used to present food.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{this can}} be a {{cumbersome}} way to prepare spätzle, several devices were invented to facilitate cooking that resemble <b>a</b> strainer or <b>colander,</b> potato ricer (Spätzlepresse), food mill or coarse grater (Spätzlehobel).

Those instruments that use muscle pressure in addition to gravity can be used with a firmer dough; that for a Spätzlehobel should be as [...] "runny" [...] as the one for scraping.|$|R

60|$|The {{good woman}} set oat-bread before {{me and a}} cold grouse, patting my {{shoulder}} and smiling {{to me all the}} time, for she had no English; and the old gentleman (not to be behind) brewed me a strong punch out of their country spirit. All the while I was eating, and after that when I was drinking the punch, I could scarce come to believe in my good fortune; and the house, though it was thick with the peat-smoke and as full of holes as <b>a</b> <b>colander,</b> seemed like a palace.|$|E
60|$|I was {{drifting}} about a reedy bay (the same bay {{in which}} the almost forgotten kingfisher had cheated {{me out of my}} bear, after eating a minnow that my paddle had routed out for him) shooting frogs for my table with a pocket rifle. How different it was here, I reflected, from the woods about home. There the game was already harried; the report of a gun set every living creature skulking. Here the crack of my little rifle was no more heeded than the plunge of a fish-hawk, or the groaning of a burdened elm bough. A score of fat woodcock lay unheeding in that bit of alder tangle yonder, the ground bored like <b>a</b> <b>colander</b> after their night's feeding. Up on the burned hillside the partridges said, quit, quit! when I appeared, and jumped to a tree and craned their necks to see what I was. The black ducks skulked in the reeds. They were full-grown now and strong of wing, but the early hiding habit was not yet broken up by shooting. They would glide through the sedges, and double the bogs, and crouch in a tangle till the canoe was almost upon them, when with a rush and a frightened hark-ark! they shot into the air and away to the river. The mink, changing from brown to black, gave up his nest-robbing for honest hunting, undismayed by trap or deadfall; and up in the inlet I could see grassy domes rising above the bronze and gold of the marsh, where Musquash was building thick and high for winter cold and spring floods. Truly it was good to be here, and to enter for a brief hour into the shy, wild but unharried life of the wood folk.|$|E
50|$|When one {{analyzes}} complex systems, {{sensitivity to}} initial conditions, for example, {{is not an}} issue as important as it is within chaos theory, in which it prevails. <b>As</b> stated by <b>Colander,</b> the study of complexity is the opposite of the study of chaos. Complexity is about how a huge number of extremely complicated and dynamic sets of relationships can generate some simple behavioral patterns, whereas chaotic behavior, in the sense of deterministic chaos, {{is the result of a}} relatively small number of non-linear interactions.|$|R

30|$|Weight matter {{leaching}} {{was examined}} {{for the second}} dietary protein trial. The experiment was conducted in an experimental test system. Three pieces of each feed (1.0  cm 2 /piece) served as for replication, three replications per diet. They were weighed to obtain the initial weights of the three replications, then placed in <b>an</b> empty <b>colander</b> without opihi for 12  h. Stability of feed was assessed according to the equation: Water absorbed (%) = {(FW−IW)/IW} ×  100. Where IW is initial weight of feed, and FW is the final weight of feed of the same diet after being immersed in water. The retained feed was rinsed with fresh water and transferred to a drying oven for 12  h at 100  °C to obtain dry weight. To obtain the initial dry weight of each diet, three other pieces of each diet were weighed and dried in the oven, this dry weight served as initial dried weight control. This data {{were used to determine}} leaching losses due to soaking.|$|R

500|$|The {{species was}} first {{mentioned}} in the scientific literature by Samuel Doody in the second edition of John Ray's Synopsis methodica Stirpium Brittanicorum in 1696. Doody briefly described the mushroom like so: [...] "fungus pulverulentus coli instar perforatus, cum volva stellata" [...] (mushroom dusty, like <b>a</b> perforated <b>colander,</b> volva star-shaped), {{and went on to}} explain that he found it in 1695 in Kent.It was first described scientifically as a new species in 1776 from collections made in England by James Dickson, who named it Lycoperdon coliforme. He found it growing in roadside banks and hedgerows among nettles in Suffolk and Norfolk. Nicaise Auguste Desvaux first defined and published the new genus Myriostoma in 1809, with the species renamed Myriostoma anglicum (an illegitimate renaming). Christian Hendrik Persoon had previously placed the species in Geastrum in 1801, while Samuel Frederick Gray would in 1821 describe the genus Polystoma for it. Myriostoma coliforme received its current and final name when August Carl Joseph Corda moved Dickson's name to Myriostoma in 1842, replacing Desvaux's name.|$|R
