25|$|<b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>stands,</b> {{a citywide}} {{deployment}} with many lines and closely spaced stations, as envisioned by proponents, {{has yet to}} be constructed. Past projects have failed because of financing, cost overruns, regulatory conflicts, political issues, misapplied technology, and flaws in design, engineering or review.|$|E
25|$|The e-krona is a {{proposed}} electronic currency {{to be issued}} directly by the Riksbank.

25|$|There {{have been}} two major {{additions}} to the Mill. The first occurred in the 1880s when a two story L-shaped addition was added. The second was a two-story annex added in the 1900s. The three sections combine {{to make up the}} look of mill <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>stands</b> today.|$|E

25|$|The village {{church is}} today {{dedicated}} to St Dunstan although an early 19th-century watercolour records it as dedicated to All Saints. Church at KentArchaeology.org.uk Although it has Norman origins, the church <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>stands</b> today was constructed principally in the 12th century and was repaired and enlarged in 1862.

25|$|Although not {{expected}} until between 2010 and 2015, {{it is intended}} that the CSME will have a single currency. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>stands</b> {{a number of the}} CSME members are already in a currency union with the Eastern Caribbean dollar and the strength of most regional currencies (with the exception of Jamaica's and Guyana's) should make any future exchange-rate harmonization between CSME members fairly straightforward as a step towards a monetary union.|$|E
25|$|In Israel, {{a debate}} {{continues}} over the Law of Return. Some people wish to retain it <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>stands,</b> others want to modify it, and some {{to abolish the}} Law completely. Those who would abolish the Law object to it because it grants Jews rights that members of other groups governed by the State of Israel do not have. Others argue that the law permits the entry of too many non-Jews, thereby undermining its purpose.|$|E

25|$|All the old barrack {{buildings}} were demolished in 1936 {{to allow the}} construction of the present red brick buildings. One of the more unfortunate aspects of development since the 1930s has been the encroachment of structures outside the Fort Walls, especially on the Hesse and King Street sides. In terms of layout and despite some changes in architectural style, the Fort, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>stands</b> today, is almost {{the same as it was}} in 1889.|$|E
25|$|The Wood Gate <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>stands</b> {{today is}} a Gothic {{structure}} dating to {{the first half of}} the 15th century. Like the Iron Tower, the six-storey tower has walls of crushed stone articulated by square quoins and two dividing cornices, and is surmounted by a hipped roof, in this case very steep. In contrast to the Iron Tower, however, the Wood Tower is much more slenderly proportioned, which is typical of the 'verticality' of the Gothic style.|$|E
25|$|The former {{separated}} {{state of}} the site has meant that Carlton le Willows <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>stands</b> today has two sizable assembly halls, two libraries and {{twice the number of}} playing fields {{as a result of the}} merger. The nature of two main structures has also resulted in the comparatively older grammar school building being known as the 'Upper School', and the former technical building the 'Lower School' among students (despite the West and East sites being the official terms).|$|E

25|$|Although a diary {{may provide}} {{information}} for a memoir, autobiography or biography, {{it is generally}} written not {{with the intention of}} being published <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>stands,</b> but for the author's own use. In recent years, however, there is internal evidence in some diaries (e.g. those of Ned Rorem, Alan Clark, Tony Benn or Simon Gray) that they are written with eventual publication in mind, with the intention of self-vindication (pre- or posthumous) or simply for profit.|$|E
25|$|The {{settlement}} at Amer {{was founded}} by Raja Alan Singh, a ruler from the Chanda clan of Meenas in 967 CE. The Amer Fort, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>stands</b> now, was built over the remnants of this earlier structure {{during the reign of}} Raja Man Singh, the Kachwaha King of Amber. The structure was fully expanded by his descendant, Jai Singh I. Even later, Amer Fort underwent improvements and additions by successive rulers over the next 150 years, until the Kachwahas shifted their capital to Jaipur during the time of Sawai Jai Singh II, in 1727.|$|E
25|$|Epping, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>stands</b> today, {{has grown}} as a favoured town of {{residence}} {{for those who}} work in London. Its market still brings shoppers in from surrounding villages and towns every Monday. Perhaps the most prominent building in Epping these days is the District Council's office with its clock tower, designed to bring balance to the High Street with the old Gothic Revival water tower at the southern end, built in 1872, and St John's Church tower in the centre. The centre of Epping on and around the High Street is a designated conservation area.|$|E

They are from good vouchers: the latter period from the accounts on your table; the earlier from an original manuscript of Davenant, who first established the Inspector-General's office, which has been ever since his time so abundant a source of Parliamentary information.|$|R
