[...] Besides, to Adam, the conception of the future was so inseparable from the painful image of his father that the fear of <b>any</b> <b>fatal</b> <b>accident</b> to him was excluded by the deeply infixed fear of his continual degradation. The next thought that occurred to him was one that made him slip off his shoes and tread lightly upstairs, to listen at the bedroom doors. But both Seth and his mother were breathing regularly.|$|E

40|$|Car Driver Assisted for Blind Spot System is invented {{to observe}} the blind spot region and alert the driver {{automatically}} to ensure the driver safety on highway due to the driver inability {{to observe the}} blind spot area directly which had caused many accident occur. Eventually, the system is built {{from a combination of}} a circuit and programming software of microcontroller and ultrasonic sensor. In this project, 2 ultrasonic sensors will be put at the right side of a car because the risk of danger in the blind spot is higher at the driver side. The sensors will be put on the lateral side of the front and rear side of a car to check the incoming vehicle at the blind spot. The sensors will be activated at a certain speed and when both sensors detect a vehicle at the blind spot, a warning system will trigger. An indicator light or LED located at the side mirror will be used as visual warning system while a buzzer will be used as audio warning system which can be install inside the car. Hence, the system will help a driver to drive safely and prevent <b>any</b> <b>fatal</b> <b>accident</b> involving blind spot. As the result, the statistic for accident can be lower. ...|$|E

50|$|E18 through Østfold {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{highways}} between Norway and Sweden. It is part of “the Nordic triangle” (Oslo - Stockholm - Copenhagen). Close to 25% of all goods transported between Norway and its surrounding countries are transported on the E18. The E18 also serves as an essential route for the transportation of goods and people to and from the inner part of Østfold. The national transport plan (2002-2011) which was presented in Parliamentary Announcement 46, (Stortingsmelding 46) (1999-2000) has accomplished certain goals and improved upon areas of community interest. At the very base, the hope is that there will not be <b>any</b> <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> or serious injuries. This is also referred to as the “zero - vision.” In the parliamentary announcement it was shown that a narrow four-lane highway ought to be considered as a better alternative to the two-lane highway in the light of traffic safety. The construction of the new E18 through Østfold is a part of the Østfold-package, (Østfoldpakka) which is funded by toll plazas and the government. The Østfold-package was declared by the government on February 24, 2000, in the parliamentary proposition 26 (1999-2000)The primary goals for the Østfold-package are to ease the flow of traffic and create a safer E18 by laying the highway on the outskirts of densely populated areas.|$|R

40|$|In the United States, an {{analysis}} {{has shown that}} tighter fuel efficiency requirements that leads to lighter vehicle bodies would cause {{an increase in the}} number of <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents.</b> However, other recent work argues that fuel economy is not relevant to the occurrence rate of <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents.</b> This research is aimed at examining the relationship between vehicle characteristics including fuel economy and the occurrence rate of accidents in Japan. Traditionally, the safety of passenger cars has been assessed through the use of laboratory data from the viewpoint of risk of death and injury under the assumption that accidents have already occurred and results have been published in New Car Assessment. On the other hand, we examined safety from the perspective of the occurrence rate of accidents resulting in death (<b>fatal</b> <b>accidents)</b> and accidents resulting in injury or death (hereinafter “accidents”). We conducted negative binominal regression analyses of the occurrence rates of <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> and accidents, taking into consideration the influence of driver-related factors, and vehicle characteristics. The results of our analysis demonstrate that there was no important difference in the adjusted occurrence rates of <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> and accidents, which excluded the effects of driver-related characteristics, among vehicle types other than minivans and sport and specialty cars. In addition, the adjusted occurrence rate of <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> was not strongly correlated with the score in New Car Assessment. While the adjusted occurrence rate of <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> exhibited a tendency to decrease inversely with the increase in the weight of the vehicle, we obtained an opposite result for sport and specialty cars, which have an adjusted high occurrence rate of <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents.</b> There is the possibility that the interior volume or the vehicle shape has a greater influence on the occurrence rate of <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates to {{what extent}} and in what ways {{conditions}} related to the 2007 - 2008 recession reduced fatal crashes.

Using state-by-quarter fixed effects models, the study shows that unemployment rate increases significantly reduce <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents.</b> Decomposing the <b>fatal</b> <b>accident</b> rate into accidents per mile traveled and miles traveled per capita reveals that higher unemployment is significantly associated with fewer accidents per mile, and also reveals that <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> associated with alcohol are more responsive to unemployment rate changes than are accidents overall.
