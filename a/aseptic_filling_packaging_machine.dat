40|$|Sequences of {{operations}} on <b>packaging</b> <b>machines</b> {{can be described}} as a series of basic operations. Such basic operations are, for instance, the transport of the packaging material through the machine, the moulding of the packaging material to the package, by folding for example, the dosing and filling up of the products to be packed and the closing of the <b>filled</b> <b>package,</b> for instance by heat sealing. There are several characteristic basic operations for every type of <b>packaging</b> <b>machine.</b> The aim is to find out the relevant properties of the packaging materials for the several basic operations and to determine ranges of numerical values for them wherein maximum undisturbed processing is guaranteed. This is demonstrated on the vertical pouch form-fill seal machine. The tightness of the closures, which are mostly attainable by heat sealing in the case of plastic films, laminated material and plastic coated papers, is of great importance for maintaining the quality of the packed product. The quality of the heat-sealed seams depends on temperature, pressure and dwell time at the heat-sealing process on the one hand, and on the sealing procedure and on the construction of the heat sealing devices, especially of the surface profile, on the other hand. It is shown how leakages in heat sealed seams and in packages in general {{have an effect on the}} efficiency of moisture-proof, gas and vacuum packages...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{possible}} reasons for post-contamination of extended shelf life (ESL) milk could be attachment and formation of biofilms on stainless steel pipe surfaces. In South Africa, ESL milk processors are still facing challenges extending the shelf life beyond 14 days. It is hypothesized that post-contamination along the milk processing line is responsible of reducing the shelf life of ESL milk. This assumption was investigated by assessing the microorganisms associated with the nozzles of <b>aseptic</b> <b>filling</b> machines post CIP process and {{this study was designed}} and divided into two phases. Phase one involved isolation and characterisation of the bacteria associated with the nozzles of <b>aseptic</b> <b>filling</b> machines after CIP process with the aim of determining the diversity of microorganisms attached to the nozzles of <b>aseptic</b> <b>filling</b> machines. Swab samples were collected from a plant processing ESL milk. Twenty swabs were taken from ten different nozzles of <b>aseptic</b> <b>filling</b> machines during 4 visits (n= 80). The swab samples were plated on the day of sampling. A total bacterial count ranging from 1. 75 - 1. 95 log CFU/cm 3 with an average of 1. 81 log CFU/cm 3 (n= 80). MALDI-TOF revealed a high percentage of Gram-positive rods (69 %), followed by Gram-positive cocci (20 %) and then Gram-negative rods (7 %). The Gram-positive rods belonging to genus Bacillus were identified as Bacillus cereus, followed by B. pumilus, B. subtilis and Paenibacillus spp. The Gram-positive cocci included S. hominis, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus and Anaerococcus spp. The Gram-negative rods were identified as Acinetobacter junii. The prevalence of Bacillus spp. noted in the nozzles of ESL <b>aseptic</b> <b>filling</b> machines is attributed to their ability to resist heat treatment during CIP process and their ability to attach to stainless steel surfaces. There was a degree of similarity in terms of MALDI-TOF MS profiles for the strains of B. cereus, Staphylococcus spp. and Paenibacillus spp. originating from the nozzles of <b>aseptic</b> <b>filling</b> <b>machines</b> and the <b>packaged</b> ESL milk product. Furthermore, these isolates show close relatedness. These bacteria are likely to originate from the nozzles, dispensed into the final ESL milk during filling process. Phase two aimed at determining cell surface hydrophobicity of the isolates originating from the nozzles of <b>aseptic</b> <b>filling</b> machines. Co-currently the study further determined the ability of B. cereus, S. epidermidis, M. luteus and Paenibacillus spp. to attach and form biofilms on stainless surfaces. The bacterial strains were isolated from the nozzles of <b>aseptic</b> <b>filling</b> machines. The degree of hydrophobicity of the spore formers ranged from 8 - 91 % while non-spore formers ranged from 6 - 67 %. Hydrophobicity of S. hominis, S. epidermidis, Acinetobacter junii and Arthrobacter castelli differed significantly (p? 0. 05). Hydrophobicity of B. pumilus, Paenibacillus spp. and B. cereus (p? 0. 05) differed significantly. Spore formers showed the highest hydrophobicity to solvents, this can be contributed to their hydrophobic nature and their ability to attach to stainless surfaces. A continuous flow reactor system was used to grow biofilm of the isolates in skim milk. The skim milk was inoculated with spore suspension of B. cereus, Paenibacillus spp. and bacterial suspension of M. luteus and S. epidermidis. The bacterial suspensions were run separately over a period of 20 h at 37 °C. Stainless steel strips were submitted to Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) after 22 h. The results suggested that spores of B. cereus and Paenibacillus spp. can only attach whilst M. luteus and S. epidermidis can attach and form biofilms on stainless steel. The ability of these isolates to form biofilms on stainless steel strips could be the main cause of contamination of ESL milk. Strains of Bacillus spp. can form biofilm on stainless steel and limit the shelf life of milk and milk products. However, toxins produced by some of these strains of B. cereus might be contagious to humans. The results confirmed {{that one of the reasons}} of contamination of ESL milk could be the ability of B. cereus to attach to stainless surfaces and M. luteus to form biofilms. Over and above the fact that the spores of B. cereus can lead to spoilage of milk and milk products, a concern is that the toxins produced by some of the strains of B. cereus are detrimental to human health.

40|$|In common <b>aseptic</b> <b>filling</b> processes, {{hydrogen}} peroxide vapour is a predominantly applied antimicrobial for the inactivation of microorganisms in packages. During this process, the germicidal effectivity of the antimicrobial treatment depends {{especially on the}} H 2 O 2 concentration of the gas mixture. For the detection of H 2 O 2 in <b>aseptic</b> <b>filling</b> processes, a novel thin-film calorimetric gas sensor based on a differential set-up of a catalytically activated and a passivated temperature sensing element has been realised in the present work. The sensor device contains two meander-shaped platinum resistances as temperature sensing elements: both have been passivated with spin-coated perfluoralkoxy. As catalytically active materials for the calorimetric gas sensor, palladium, platinum black and manganese oxide particles have been studied in the developed experimental set-up, wherein MnO 2 has shown the highest sensitivity of 0. 57 degrees C/% (v/v) towards H 2 O 2. Afterwards, the characteristic of the sensor device with MnO 2 particles as catalyst has been examined at various H 2 O 2 concentrations and additionally, the influence of gas temperature and gas flow rate on the sensor signal has been validated in the experimental set-up.
