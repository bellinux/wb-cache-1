5|$|Art {{historians have}} {{suggested}} completion dates {{ranging from the}} early 1440s to the early 1460s, with c. 1455 seen as probable. The panel was acquired by Andrew Mellon in the 1930s, {{and was one of}} several hundreds from his personal collection donated to the National Gallery of <b>Art</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington.</b> It has suffered damage and was restored in the early 1990s for an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} is {{today in the}} National Gallery of <b>Art</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C., which was conceived by Pittsburgh financier Andrew Mellon in the late 1930s.

5|$|From Bates, {{the picture}} passed to Walter Tyrell; {{another member of}} the Tyrell family, Edward, {{presented}} it to the National Gallery, London, in 1863, after it had failed to sell at an auction at Christie's in 1854. The painting was transferred to the Tate Gallery in 1929, although it was actually on loan to Derby Museum and Art Gallery between 1912 and 1947. It has been lent out for exhibitions to the National Gallery of <b>Art</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C. in 1976, the National Museum of Fine Arts in Stockholm in 1979–1980, and Paris (Grand Palais), New York (Metropolitan) and the Tate in London in 1990. It was reclaimed by the National Gallery from the Tate in 1986. They describe its condition as good, with minor alterations visible on some figures. It was last cleaned in 1974.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1960s, {{directors}} of the National Gallery of <b>Art</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C., declared {{the need for a}} new building. Paul Mellon, a primary benefactor of the gallery and a member of its building committee, set to work with his assistant J. Carter Brown (who became gallery director in 1969) to find an architect. The new structure would be located to the east of the original building, and tasked with two functions: offer a large space for public appreciation of various popular collections; and house office space as well as archives for scholarship and research. They likened the scope of the new facility to the Library of Alexandria. After inspecting Pei's work at the Des Moines Art Center in Iowa and the Johnson Museum at Cornell University, they offered him the commission.|$|E
5|$|Michael Laucke (born 29January 1947) is a Canadian classical, new flamenco, and flamenco guitarist and composer, {{and music}} {{industry}} businessman. From age thirteen, Laucke gave professional snooker demonstrations. He was successful at this venture, and his winnings {{allowed him to}} take trips from Montreal to New York City to study classical guitar with Rolando Valdés-Blain. He began performing in 1965, recording the first of 16 albums in 1969. In 1971, he performed his first of many concerts at the National Gallery of <b>Art</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C. His first concert in New York took place in 1972, where he first met U.S. Senator Claiborne Pell. Laucke is still active in a career spanning five decades, and toured 25countries.|$|E
5|$|The {{technical}} investigations Butler {{conducted during}} her tenure resulted in worldwide collaborations and three publications. The {{culmination of the}} research came in 1998 with an exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The exhibition was small, {{with a handful of}} paintings and a few manuscript leaves. Only two are definitively attributed to the master, the Annunciation, which came from the National Gallery of <b>Art</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C., and Saint Barbara, loaned from Antwerp. Two Saint Christophers, one in Philadelphia and the other from the Louvre, are considered to be by workshop members. From Cleveland came a John the Baptist in the Landscape, thought to be by van Eyck followers. The Philadelphia and Turin Saint Francis paintings were both on display, reunited for probably {{the first time since the}} 15th century.|$|E

5|$|In 1926 Harold Knight {{spent several}} {{months at the}} Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, in America, {{painting}} portrait commissions of surgeons. Laura joined him there and was given permission to paint at the Baltimore Children's Hospital and in the black wards of the racially segregated Johns Hopkins Hospital. Whilst in Baltimore Knight painted a nurse, Pearl Johnson, who took her to meetings and concerts of the early American civil rights movement. Knight also hired a mother and child model to pose for the composition originally known as the Madonna of the Cotton Fields. Knight took these paintings back to London with her and they feature in the Pathé newsreel produced to mark her election as an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1927. Another portrait of Johnson, Irene and Pearl, shows two women {{against a backdrop of}} skyscrapers and was {{one of a number of}} portraits Knight painted in the late 1920s that appear strikingly modern. Miss Ealand, shown at the Royal Academy in 1928, depicts a woman with cropped hair wearing a jacket and holding a gun. The same year Knight's portrait of a women saxophone player was displayed at the National Gallery of <b>Art</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> DC.|$|E
5|$|Irving Blum {{made the}} {{original}} thirty-two canvases {{available to the}} public through an arrangement with the National Gallery of <b>Art</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> DC by placing them on permanent loan two days before Warhol's death. However, the original Campbell's Soup Cans is now a part of the Museum of Modern Art permanent collection. A print called Campbell's Soup Cans II is part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. 200 Campbell's Soup Cans, 1962 (Acrylic on canvas, 72inches x 100inches), in the private collection of John and Kimiko Powers is the largest single canvas of the Campbell's Soup can paintings. It is composed of ten rows and twenty columns of numerous flavors of soups. Experts point to it {{as one of the most}} significant works of pop art both as a pop representation and as conjunction with immediate predecessors such as Jasper Johns and the successors movements of Minimal and Conceptual art. The very similar 100 Cans from the Albright-Knox Art Gallery collection is shown above. The earliest soup can painting seems to be Campbell's Soup Can (Tomato Rice), a 1960 ink, tempera, crayon, and oil canvas.|$|E
5|$|The {{children}} learn that A Lady Writing was traveling from The National Gallery of <b>Art</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> D.C. to Hyde Park. The next day {{there is a}} story in the paper of how the painting mysteriously disappeared. A letter from the thief appears in the newspaper, telling the public that he will not give back A Lady Writing until they prove which Vermeer paintings were truly painted by him. This sparks worldwide uproar. Calder and Petra investigate as their friendship grows. Mrs. Sharpe requests police protection and it is revealed that she and Ms. Hussey were two of the three recipients of the thief's letter. Calder and Petra eventually conclude that the painting is hidden in the local Delia Dell Hall, and they sneak out and find it. They barely escape from the thief, who is later found dead from a massive heart attack on the train by the police. They learn that the man is Xavier Glitts,also known as Glitter Man,who was posing as Tommy's stepfather under the name Fred Steadman. A known art thief, he was asked to steal the painting and sell it for sixty million dollars. The other recipient of the letter is revealed to be Mr. Watch.|$|E
