5000|$|Koyomi is an <b>androphobic</b> {{resident}} of Seiren. She has fear of men on Earth and her phobia is only {{made worse by}} being one of Kazuharu Fukuyama's favorite targets; in the manga, she keeps a diary of {{how many times he}} has accosted her. Originally sent to Earth on a mission from the Space Travel Agency to 'retrieve' Miharu Sena Kanaka, she later moves into Yukinari's house along with her companion Tomoka Lana Jude on a prolonged mission to find a husband for Miharu's sister Maharu. However, her fear of men makes the act of even talking to a man nearly impossible. Koyomi's favorite pastime is reading, but she has a natural talent for table tennis, having won a tournament for a similar sport on Seiren. In the anime adaptation, Koyomi is also searching for her father, a native of Earth, whom she eventually reunites with. Koyomi's mother possessed a Seikon mark, and Koyomi herself possesses a dormant form of Seikon allowing her to create a portal to Seiren after Miharu is kidnapped by Hijiri Kanata. After she loses in Fukuyama's Cosplay Mahjong game, she is forced to wear nothing but a python, which she later ironically adopts as a pet. Koyomi is voiced by Masayo Kurata in Japanese and by Carrie Savage in English. Hekiru Shiina provides her voice for the Drama CDs.|$|E
40|$|This essay {{deals with}} three British novels written by female novelists in the 1980 s: Fay Weldon's The Life and Loves of a She-Devil, Angela Carter's Nights at the Circus and Jeanette Winterson's Sexing the Cherry. The protagonists {{of these three}} novels are monstrous women who enjoy power over men in {{different}} situations. The essay considers the idea of monstrosity explored in each novel from the freakish to the carnivalesque-and argues that, first, {{it is difficult to}} assess the feminist ideology of these texts as the respective writers do not write from clearly feminist positions. Second, that whereas criticism of these novels has focused on their (questionable) feminism, little has been said about the role played by men in them or about the implicit <b>androphobic</b> discourse of some fiction by women. Third, that the model of female power offered by these novels is too limited; they pale besides the analysis of powerful female monstrosity offered in some novels by men. The conclusion, supported by Angela Carter's thesis lhat women are reluctant do acknowledge their own moral faults, is that women are reluctant to acknowledge their own moral faults, is that women are offering a biased portrait of themselves, in which the exploration of women's weaknesses is too narrow, even when the issue of female monstrosity is addressed...|$|E
