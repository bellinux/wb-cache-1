5|$|During the English Civil War Plymouth {{sided with}} the Parliamentarians and was besieged for almost four years by the Royalists. The last major attack by the Royalists was by Sir Richard Grenville leading {{thousands}} of soldiers towards Plymouth, but they were defeated by the Plymothians at Freedom Fields Park. The civil war ended as a Parliamentary win, but monarchy was restored by King Charles II in 1660, who imprisoned many of the Parliamentary heroes on Drake's Island. Construction of the Royal Citadel began in 1665, after the Restoration; it was armed with cannon facing both out to sea and into the town, rumoured to be <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>to</b> residents not to oppose the Crown. Mount Batten tower also dates from around this time.|$|E
5|$|The {{moral code}} {{embedded}} in Aboriginal lore {{is evident in}} a story from an unspecified locality in eastern Australia (probably in New South Wales) published in 1943. An Aboriginal man, fishing in a lagoon, caught a baby bunyip. Instead of returning the baby to the water, {{he wanted to take}} the bunyip back to the camp to boast of his fishing prowess, against the urging of his friends. Before he could do anything, the mother bunyip rose from the water, flooding swirling water around them, and took back her baby. As the water receded, the men found that they had been changed into black swans. As punishment for the fisherman's vanity, they never regained their human form, but could be heard at night talking in human voices as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>to</b> their human relatives of the perils of pride and arrogance.|$|E
5|$|However, by {{the turn}} of the 20th century, the {{quarries}} slowly fell into disuse and by the 1960s all of the remaining industrial areas had closed and the quarries infilled, though the sandstone properties at St Alban's Place and Co-Operative Terrace stand as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>to</b> Windy Nook's industrial history. The decrease in employment opportunities led to a steady decline in population and although some housing developed along Stone Street and Coldwell Lane, the urban sprawl that enveloped most of the outlying settlements of Gateshead during the early 20th century never reached Windy Nook, so that in 1945 it remained largely unchanged in location and size. Despite some terraced housing being built in at Crossfield Park and Coltsfoot Gardens in the 197080's, the character of the suburb today remains suburban; the land is split 50/50 between residential properties and open green space and only 11.3% of the residential properties today are council housing. The result is that Windy Nook is a high-demand area for privately owned and social housing.|$|E

5|$|The next day, Gawain {{leaves for}} the Green Chapel with the girdle wound twice around his waist. He finds the Green Knight {{sharpening}} an axe and, as promised, Gawain bends his bared neck to receive his blow. At the first swing Gawain flinches slightly and the Green Knight belittles him for it. Ashamed of himself, Gawain doesn’t flinch {{with the second}} swing; but again the Green Knight withholds {{the full force of}} his blow. The knight explains he was testing Gawain's nerve. Angrily Gawain tells him to deliver his blow and so the knight does, causing only a slight wound on Gawain's neck. The game is over. Gawain seizes his sword, helmet and shield, but the Green Knight, laughing, reveals himself to be the lord of the castle, Bertilak de Hautdesert, transformed by magic. He explains that the entire adventure was a trick of the 'elderly lady' Gawain saw at the castle, who is actually the sorceress Morgan le Fay, Arthur's sister, who intended to test Arthur's knights and frighten Guinevere to death. Gawain is ashamed to have behaved deceitfully but the Green Knight laughs and professes him the most blameless knight in all the land. The two part on cordial terms. Gawain returns to Camelot wearing the girdle as a token of his failure to keep his promise. The Knights of the Round Table absolve him of blame and decide that henceforth that they will wear a green sash in recognition of Gawain's adventure and as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>to</b> be always honest.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the climactic}} battle in Dune, Paul Atreides and the Fremen watch the Padishah Emperor's encampment {{to see whether}} he will raise the Atreides flag, {{indicating}} a recognition of Paul's claims, or the banner of Paul's Harkonnen enemies. Instead, the Emperor raises the flag of CHOAM, as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>to</b> all of the combatant parties that economics trump political considerations.|$|E

25|$|A setup of the {{architecture}} also shifts {{the focus of the}} building. The entry to the outdoor narthex of the Chapel is created with a tent-like flap extending over the entry, creating an enclosed space that is still outdoors. The entrances to the Chapel are faced away {{from the center of the}} building and towards the tabernacle as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>to</b> all who enter that the central point of the Chapel is not the altar or the crucifix, but rather the location of the Eucharist.|$|E
25|$|Repetition {{involves}} expressing dissent about a topic/issue repeatedly {{at different}} points in time. This strategy is often used when an employee feels nothing is being done to correct the original articulated problem/issue and feel that the issue warrants being repeated. The problem with this strategy is that repetition in a short period can be seen as destructive. Especially if the abbreviated time frame does not allow the supervisor enough time to respond. However, if repetition is used over an extended time period it may be considered active–constructive since it may serve as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>to</b> the supervisor.|$|E
25|$|In The Deer and the Cauldron, Cha {{intentionally}} {{created an}} anticlimax and an antihero in Wei Xiaobao, who possesses {{none of the}} desirable traditional values and no knowledge in any form of martial arts, and depends on a protective vest made of alloy to absorb full-frontal attack when in trouble, and a dagger that can cut through anything. Wei was a street urchin and a womanising weasel, with no admirable qualities whatsoever. The fiction writer Ni Kuang wrote a connected critique of all of Cha's works and concluded that Cha concluded his work with The Deer and the Cauldron as a satire to his earlier work, and <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>to</b> the readers for a reality check.|$|E

25|$|A basic Sumbanese {{house has}} a square layout. This layout can be as small as 5 x 5 meter of as big as 15 x 15 meter. Four main posts {{supported}} the roof peak of a house, these posts are imbued with mystical symbolism. A Sumbanese house can accommodate a single family or several extended families. Two entrance accesses are positioned {{to the left and}} right of the house. There is no window in a Sumbanese house, cross ventilation is provided from small openings in the wall, which is made of plaited palm boughs, areca sheath, or – among the very rich – buffalo hide. Buffalo horns often decorate the walls, <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>to</b> past sacrifice.|$|E
25|$|The rabbis of the Middle Ages {{discussed}} {{the issue of}} people eating milk and meat {{at the same table}}. Jacob ben Asher suggested that each individual should eat from different tablecloths, while Moses Isserles argued that a large and obviously unusual item should be placed between the individuals, as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>to</b> avoid sharing the foods. Later rabbinic writers pointed out exceptions to the rule. Chaim ibn Attar, an 18th-century kabbalist, ruled that sitting at the same table as a non-Jew eating non-kosher food was permissible; Yechiel Michel Epstein, a 19th-century rabbi, argued that the risk was sufficiently reduced if individuals sat far enough apart {{that the only way to}} share food was to leave the table.|$|E
25|$|Extensive {{works were}} {{constructed}} {{to defend the}} town, including a line of stockaded earthworks on high ground north of the town, from Lipson in the east to Eldad in the west, {{as well as several}} isolated works, for instance at Prince Rock, Cattedown and Stonehouse. Various skirmishes and confrontations occurred, including the rout of Royalist cavalry along Lipson Ridge on 3 December 1643, which is commemorated by a monument in Freedom Fields Park, and the battle of St Budeaux. Construction of the Royal Citadel began in 1665, after the Restoration; it was armed with cannon facing both out to sea and into the town, rumoured to be <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>to</b> residents not to oppose the Crown.|$|E

25|$|In Judaism, Ecclesiastes is read {{either on}} Shemini Atzeret (by Yemenites, Italians, some Sepharadim, and the mediaeval French Jewish rite) {{or on the}} Shabbat of the Intermediate Days of Sukkot (by Ashkenazim). If there is no Intermediate Sabbath of Sukkot, even the Ashkenazim read it on Shemini Atzeret (or, for Ashkenazim in the Land of Israel, on the first Shabbat of Sukkot). It is read on Sukkot as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>to</b> not get too {{caught up in the}} festivities of the holiday, as well as to carry over the {{happiness}} of Sukkot {{to the rest of the}} year by telling the listeners that, without God, life is meaningless. When the listeners take this to heart, then true happiness can be achieved throughout the year.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} week of November, Gazprom CEO Miller {{announced}} that if no agreement was reached {{by the end of the}} year, prices could rise significantly higher than what was currently being proposed. A few days later Prime Minister Putin warned that if there was any interference with transit gas, supplies to Ukraine would be cut off. These warnings were repeated throughout December, with additional warnings that disruptions to European supplies could result. The European Commission did not attempt to intervene, but the Energy Charter Secretariat issued a statement on December 23 which recalled the principle of uninterrupted transit. This was seen as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>to</b> Ukraine of its obligations under the Energy Charter Treaty, which it has signed and, unlike Russia, ratified.|$|E
25|$|Souray {{was born}} in Elk Point, Alberta, to Richard Souray and Lillian Parenteau. He is of Métis descent and has one sister, two years older. At a young age, Souray moved with his family from Fishing Lake Métis Settlement to a small {{community}} in Alberta in order for his sister to attend school. In another two years, they moved again so that Souray could play organized sports. While still in elementary school, Souray's parents divorced; he first {{lived with his mother}} before moving in with his father at age nine. Growing up, he attended Archbishop O'Leary Catholic High School with former fellow Oiler Fernando Pisani. Souray has a tattoo of a Métis Chief in full headdress on his arm. He says the tattoo is meant as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>to</b> himself to be a positive role model for Native and Métis children, as he himself is proud of his Métis heritage.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} with Living in the Material World in 1973, [...] "It Is 'He'" [...] {{was the sole}} example of a devotional song on the album. Leng considers that Dark Horse coincided with [...] "a crisis of faith" [...] on Harrison's part and that, amid confessionals dealing with the singer's troubled personal life and rock-star excess, the track was [...] "almost <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>to</b> himself of golden days in India, when he felt comforted by belief".|$|E
500|$|In March 1818 she was {{considered}} for refitting. A drydock inspection {{revealed that the}} majority of her timber was defective or rotten and she was broken up at Portsmouth in June.

500|$|Manga artist Kaori Yuki's earlier, related short manga [...] "Psycho Knocker" [...] {{appeared}} in the October 2004 issues of the Japanese shōjo (targeted towards girls) manga magazine Hana to Yume published twice a month. It focuses on a pessimistic, heartbroken teenager who makes a pact with a lonely ghost, unknowningly exchanging her life for two wishes. Chasing down spirits that have escaped from the demon door, Raven and Tokage rescue her from the ghost, a young girl who died suddenly, and seal a spirit which feeds on negative emotions. Yuki wrote the story as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>to</b> herself {{not to be so}} pessimistic, a trait she shares with the teenage protagonist.|$|E
