5|$|The filming {{was done}} at two hospitals, the Northwick Park Hospital in Middlesex and the North Hampshire Hospital in Basingstoke. This {{presented}} <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>because</b> the show had to work around the real-life hospitals, with their actual doctors, patients and emergency situations. In one scene in the final episode in series one, Guy (Mangan) was hitting squash balls behind him, and nearly hit a patient. However, some scenes, {{such as those in}} Sue's and Alan's offices, were filmed in a studio.|$|E
5|$|An {{independent}} study revealed {{the water to}} be radioactive and potentially dangerous to drink, initially surrounding the project with controversy. Jordan's Ministry of Water and Irrigation has stated that the radioactivity is not <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>because</b> the water is to be diluted with {{an equal amount of}} water from other sources, although it remains disputed if this would be enough to bring the water up to standards. The Ministry said the {{independent study}} was inaccurate, as it did not test water from any of the wells that will be used in the project. The President of the Jordanian Geologists Association Bahjat Al Adwan stated that the radiation is present in the water in the form of Radon, and thus dissipates harmlessly when the water is exposed to air on the surface.|$|E
5|$|Noise {{pollution}} from anthropogenic activities is another major concern for marine mammals. This is <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>because</b> {{underwater noise pollution}} interferes with the abilities of some marine mammals to communicate, and locate both predators and prey. Underwater explosions are used {{for a variety of}} purposes including military activities, construction and oceanographic or geophysical research. They can cause injuries such as hemorrhaging of the lungs, and contusion and ulceration of the gastrointestinal tract. Underwater noise is generated from shipping, the oil and gas industry, research, and military use of sonar and oceanographic acoustic experimentation. Acoustic harassment devices and acoustic deterrent devices used by aquaculture facilities to scare away marine mammals emit loud and noxious underwater sounds.|$|E

5|$|The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., {{was filmed}} {{primarily}} on the Warner Bros. soundstages. Town and street scenes were staged on the Western backlot, known as Laramie Street. It {{was one of the}} last Western shows to use the backlot. Cuse said that logistics were <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>because</b> so many of the Hollywood Western sets and towns had been torn down by the 1990s. Outdoor scenes were shot on the Warner Bros. ranch in Valencia, California; Bronson Canyon in Los Angeles; and the Valuze Ranch in Santa Clarita, California. Some of the locomotive scenes from Brisco were filmed on location at Railtown 1897 State Historic Park in Jamestown, California. A painting used in the show as a backdrop to create illusions of greater depth perspectives is exhibited at the park.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} the war in August 1945, the Manhattan Project's {{priority}} {{shifted from}} speed to economy and efficiency. By early 1946, with K-27 in operation, the K-25 plant was producing 3.6kg per day, enriched to 30 percent. The next step was to increase the enrichment further to 60 percent. This was achieved on 20 July 1946. This presented <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> <b>because</b> Y-12 was not equipped to handle feed that was so highly enriched, but the Los Alamos Laboratory required 95 percent. For a time, product was mixed with feed to reduce the enrichment to 30 percent. Taking the concentration up to 95 percent raised a number of safety concerns, as there was the risk of a criticality accident.|$|E
5|$|During its peak, up to 300 people {{visited the}} hot spring daily. On 1 March 2002, {{it was closed}} for two months while {{upgrading}} and improvement works were carried out to {{the area around the}} spring, which had become sodden and muddy. Litter had also become <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>because</b> of the increased numbers of visitors. The former dirt track leading to the spring was paved with cement, and lined with bougainvillea bushes and high fences to ensure the security of the air base. Drainage pipes were also installed. Mindef, which owns the land, allows public access between 7 am and 7 pm daily, free-of-charge. When the spring reopened on 1 May 2002, more than 100 people visited the site despite the afternoon drizzle. At the same time, some new free-hold condominiums were built in the surrounding area; one of the developments, built by the property arm of F in 2001, is called Seletaris after the company's former mineral water.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, saboteurs caused a fire on Triglav, further eroding crew morale already under {{pressure}} from desertion. Elsewhere in the Bay of Kotor, Milan Spasić and Sergej Mašera died blowing up the destroyer Zagreb to prevent her from falling into enemy hands. Following this, Kern decided to sail out with just two boats, Durmitor and Kajmakčalan, which he deemed had the most trustworthy crews, leaving the Bay of Kotor on 17 April. Because both boats were in poor condition and overloaded with personnel, the maximum speed they could achieve was 29 knots. Before passing through the Strait of Otranto, the boats successfully evaded two groups of Italian ships. They arrived at Navarino Bay in southern Greece on 19 April and at Souda Bay in Crete on 22 April, where they were tasked with escorting a convoy to Alexandria, protecting it from possible attacks from Junkers Ju 87 dive-bombers. Once in Alexandria, they joined with other JKRM vessels and aircraft that had managed to escape, forming the JKRM in exile. The two boats were first tasked with patrolling {{the outside of the}} harbour in anticipation of an attack by Axis coastal craft. In June they operated against Vichy French forces in Syria. In 1944 they were reported as being tasked with escorting convoys between Alexandria and Port Said. However, with time the serviceability of the boats became <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>because</b> of the lack of spare parts needed for their German-built engines.|$|E

25|$|Flowing {{water will}} not be a {{breeding}} spot, and water that contains minnows is not usually <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> <b>because</b> the fish eat the mosquito larvae.

25|$|In tourist towns, such as Queenstown in the South Island, some {{exemptions}} {{are granted}} by the district council for selected shops to open on Good Friday. The reason is {{to keep up the}} level of service to the tourists, as many would not know the shops will be closed on that day. However, liquor sale is restricted for some of that day (not usually <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>because</b> shops are usually closed on that day).|$|E
25|$|According to Pamela Lutgin-Sandvik, {{the lack}} of unifying {{language}} to name the phenomenon of workplace bullying is <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>because</b> without a unifying term or phrase, individuals have difficulty naming their experiences of abuse, and therefore have trouble pursuing justice against the bully. Unlike sexual harassment, which named a specific problem and is now recognized in law of many countries (including U.S.), workplace bullying is still being established as a relevant social problem and {{is in need of}} a specific vernacular.|$|E
500|$|Acne vulgaris and its {{resultant}} scars {{have been}} associated with significant social and academic difficulties that can last into adulthood, including difficulties obtaining employment. [...] Until the 1930s, it was largely seen as <b>a</b> trivial <b>problem</b> among middle-class girls – <b>a</b> trivial <b>problem,</b> <b>because,</b> unlike smallpox and tuberculosis, no one died from it, and <b>a</b> feminine <b>problem,</b> <b>because</b> boys were much less likely to seek medical assistance for it. During the Great Depression, dermatologists discovered that young men with acne had difficulty obtaining jobs, and during World War II, some soldiers in tropical climates developed such severe and widespread tropical acne on their bodies that they were declared medically unfit for duty.|$|R

25|$|Although many around Presley {{were worried}} about his {{worsening}} drug dependency, Parker appeared to ignore the problem. Several members of Presley's band later stated that Parker had no idea just how bad the situation was, although others have stood by the suggestion that Parker just didn't want to admit there was such <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>because</b> he didn't {{know how to deal}} with it and was worried about any negative publicity it would create. According to Parker himself, he did attempt to talk to his client about the matter, but Presley simply told him to stay out of his personal life.|$|E
25|$|As the {{manufacturing}} branch expanded, its production ability increased beyond {{the demand for}} phones, and it faced closure for several months a year without manufacturing other products. This was <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>because</b> the Bell Telephone Company of Canada's (later renamed to Bell Canada) charter would {{not allow them to}} build other products. So in 1895, the Bell Telephone of Canada was required to spin off its manufacturing arm to build phones for sale to other companies, as well as other devices such as fire alarm boxes, police street call boxes, and fire department call equipment. This company was incorporated as the Northern Electric and Manufacturing Company Limited.|$|E
25|$|Gerald Weiss {{noted that}} {{although}} Tylor's classic definition of culture {{was restricted to}} humans, many anthropologists take this for granted and thus elide that important qualification from later definitions, merely equating culture with any learned behavior. This slippage is <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>because</b> during the formative years of modern primatology, some primatologists were trained in anthropology (and understood that culture refers to learned behavior among humans), and others were not. Notable non-anthropologists, like Robert Yerkes and Jane Goodall thus argued that since chimpanzees have learned behaviors, they have culture. Today, anthropological primatologists are divided, several arguing that non-human primates have culture, others arguing that they do not.|$|E

25|$|Note {{that the}} domain and codomain {{are in fact}} part of the {{information}} determining a morphism. For example, {{in the category of}} sets, where morphisms are functions, two functions may be identical as sets of ordered pairs (may have the same range), while having different codomains. The two functions are distinct from the viewpoint of category theory. Thus many authors require that the hom-classes hom(X, Y) be disjoint. In practice, this is not <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>because</b> if this disjointness does not hold, it can be assured by appending the domain and codomain to the morphisms, (say, as the second and third components of an ordered triple).|$|E
25|$|Few local Dacians were {{interested}} in the use of epigraphs, which were a central part of Roman cultural expression. In Dacia this causes <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>because</b> the survival of epigraphs into modern times is one of the ways scholars develop an understanding of the cultural and social situation within a Roman province. Apart from members of the Dacian elite and those who wished to attain improved social and economic positions, who largely adopted Roman names and manners, the majority of native Dacians retained their names and their cultural distinctiveness even with the increasing embrace of Roman cultural norms which followed their incorporation into the Roman empire.|$|E
25|$|UV {{disinfection}} is {{most effective}} for treating high-clarity, purified reverse osmosis distilled water. Suspended particles are <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>because</b> microorganisms buried within particles are shielded from the UV light and pass through the unit unaffected. However, UV systems can be coupled with a pre-filter to remove those larger organisms that would otherwise pass through the UV system unaffected. The pre-filter also clarifies the water to improve light transmittance and therefore UV dose throughout the entire water column. Another key factor of UV water treatment is the flow rate—if the flow is too high, water will pass through without sufficient UV exposure. If the flow is too low, heat may build up and damage the UV lamp.|$|E
