5000|$|Cerebral {{vasculitis}} {{or central}} nervous system vasculitis (sometimes the word <b>angiitis</b> is used instead of [...] "vasculitis") is vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessel wall) involving the brain and occasionally the spinal cord. It affects all of the vessels: very small blood vessels (capillaries), medium-size blood vessels (arterioles and venules), or large blood vessels (arteries and veins). If blood flow in a vessel with vasculitis is reduced or stopped, {{the parts of the}} body that receive blood from that vessel begins to die. It may produce a wide range of neurological symptoms, such as headache, skin rashes, feeling very tired, joint pains, difficulty moving or coordinating part of the body, changes in sensation, and alterations in perception, thought or behavior, as well as the phenomena of a mass lesion in the brain leading to coma and herniation. Some of its signs and symptoms may resemble multiple sclerosis. 10% have associated bleeding in the brain.|$|E
50|$|In the March 1979 {{report in}} Neurology, Drs. Susac, Hardman and Selhorst {{reported}} two {{patients with the}} triad of encephalopathy, hearing loss and microangiopathy of the retina. The first patient underwent brain biopsy, which revealed sclerosis {{of the media and}} adventitia of small pial and cortical vessels, suggestive of a healed <b>angiitis.</b> Both patients underwent fluorescein retinal angiography that demonstrated multifocal retinal artery occlusions without evidence of embolic disease. Though the exact pathogenesis of this disorder is unknown, the retinal and brain biopsy findings suggest a small vessel vasculopathy leading to arteriolar occlusion and microinfarction of cerebral, retinal and cochlear tissue. Demyelination is not a typical feature of Susac's syndrome. Muscle biopsies from such patients are usually normal, but some have also shown nonspecific signs of inflammation such as dense hyaline material surrounding endomysial capillaries. This suggests a possible systemic component of this disease, despite the predominance of central nervous system features. The latest thinking is that an antibody directed against endothelial cells is the pathogenic mechanism in this disease which causes the microscopic strokes in the brain, retina, and inner ear.|$|E

40|$|Isolated <b>angiitis</b> of {{the central}} nervous system (CNS) is a rare {{condition}} with an incidence estimated at less than 1 : 2 000 000 (Moore, 1999). It was defined, in 1959, as an idiopathic vasculi-tis restricted to small leptomeningeal and parenchymal arteries and veins, without apparent systemic involvement (Cravioto and Feigin, 1959). Almost 50 years later, the affliction remains poorly recognized, and its pathogenesis mysterious, despite the growing pool of knowledge on processes responsible for CNS inflamma-tion. The term “primary <b>angiitis</b> ” is sometimes preferred to “iso-lated <b>angiitis</b> ” because complete autopsies are rarely performed and minor abnormalities are occasionally observed in systemic organs of patients who died from so-called isolated CNS <b>angiitis</b> (Johnson et al., 1994). In numerous patients with no histological proof of vascular inflammation, thedescriptive term“angiopathy” is more appropriate than “angiitis, ” but the latter term has often been overused in the recent literature. Although stroke most often reveals the disease, it appears as the initial manifestation in only a minority of patients. Because of the protean clinical symptoms and blurred diagnostic criteria, identification is a difficult challenge for all clinicians. Pathology and pathogenesis Pathological picture Isolated CNS <b>angiitis</b> has been referred to by several names descriptive of the pathological findings: granulomatous <b>angiitis</b> of theCNS,giant cell granulomatousangiitisof theCNS,andcerebral granulomatous <b>angiitis</b> have all been used interchangeably (Han-key, 1991; Rhodes et al., 1995).

40|$|International audienceCentral {{nervous system}} (CNS) <b>angiitis</b> {{is a rare}} {{inflammatory}} disorder. To date, clinical data are lacking and treatment remains a matter of debate. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyse the main characteristics, response to therapy and outcome of 32 patients with CNS <b>angiitis.</b> Single-centre retrospective study in a tertiary centre was made. Diagnosis of CNS <b>angiitis</b> was made by cerebral angiography and/or magnetic resonance angiography and/or CNS biopsy. The main features and outcomes of primary and secondary CNS <b>angiitis</b> were compared and predictive factors of a favourable outcome were searched. Thirty-one patients (median age 45 Q 1 -Q 3 37 - 54) sex ratio F/M 2. 1) were included. Main clinical features were hemiparesis (35. 5  %) and headache (29  %). The median CSF protein level was 0. 64 (0. 52 - 0. 81) [*]g/L and was superior to 1  g/L in six cases. CNS magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings were most frequently ischemic (96. 8  %), bilateral (83. 9  %), multiple (87. 1  %) and supratentorial (96. 8  %). The MR angiography was abnormal in all cases. Among the 31 patients in the study, 19 (61. 3  %) were diagnosed with primary CNS <b>angiitis.</b> Systemic lupus erythematosus (n[*]=[*] 6) and vasculitis (n[*]=[*] 4) were the most frequent aetiologies of secondary CNS <b>angiitis.</b> No difference was evidenced between primary and secondary CNS <b>angiitis.</b> Steroids were administered in 79. 2  % of treated patients and combined with immunosuppressants in 79. 2  % of cases.

30|$|Vascular {{involvement}} in CMV retinitis {{can result in}} vascular sheathing. Exudates around retinal vessels, more commonly veins, can result in focal areas of fluffy white cuffing or sheathing, with or without skip areas [11].

Kyrieleis plaques can be differentiated from vascular sheathing and frosted branch <b>angiitis</b> by its clinical and fluorescein angiographic features. Kyrieleis plaques affect only the retinal arteries in contrast to frosted branch <b>angiitis</b> that involves both the retinal arteries and veins.

40|$|Abstract Background Primary <b>angiitis</b> of {{the central}} nervous system is an {{idiopathic}} disorder characterized by vasculitis within the dural confines. The clinical presentation shows a wide variation and the course and the duration of disease are heterogeneous. This rare but treatable disease provides a diagnostic challenge owing to the lack of pathognomonic tests and the necessity of a histological confirmation. Case presentation A 28 -year-old patient presenting with headache and fluctuating signs of encephalopathy was treated on the assumption of viral meningoencephalitis. The course of the disease led to his death 10 days after hospital admission. Postmortem examination revealed primary <b>angiitis</b> {{of the central}} nervous system. Conclusion Primary <b>angiitis</b> of {{the central nervous system}} should always be taken into consideration when suspected infectious inflammation of the central nervous system does not respond to treatment adequately. In order to confirm the diagnosis with the consequence of a modified therapy angiography and combined leptomeningeal and brain biopsy should be considered immediately. </p...|$|E
