25|$|ARD, the European Broadcasting Union {{member to}} {{broadcast}} the Eurovision Song Contest in Germany, {{is a joint}} organisation of Germany's regional public-service broadcasters. The ARD has 10 members. The venues that were in consideration {{are located in the}} areas of three different members: Berlin is located within the Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg (RBB) member area, Hamburg and Hanover within the Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) area and Düsseldorf within the Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR) broadcasting area. While NDR has been responsible for the transmission of the Eurovision Song Contest in recent years when the final took place in other countries, the financial scope of the three broadcasters seemed to have become a decisive factor in the <b>application</b> <b>procedure</b> for the 2011 Eurovision Song Contest. The Tagesspiegel reported on 7 October 2010 that the costs for hosting this event resulted in a tense discussion about necessary savings on other programme contents made by the three broadcasters.|$|E
25|$|Hong Kong's {{economic}} strengths {{include a}} sound banking system, virtually no public debt, a strong legal system, ample {{foreign exchange reserves}} at around US $408 billion as of mid-2017, rigorous anti-corruption measures and close ties with the mainland China. Despite the downturn, these strengths enable it to quickly respond to changing circumstances. It has the most efficient and a corruption-free <b>application</b> <b>procedure,</b> the lowest income tax, the lowest corporate tax {{as well as an}} abundant and sustainable government finance. The government of Hong Kong consistently upheld the policy of encouraging and supporting activities of private businesses. Examples include the Cyberport and the Hong Kong Disneyland. This has a positive impact on the overall economic performance by removing unnecessary barriers for the private enterprises in the Special Administrative Region. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange is a favourable destination for international firms and firms from the mainland China to be listed due to Hong Kong's highly internationalised and modernised financial industry along with its capital market in Asia, its size, regulations and available financial tools, which are comparable to London and New York.|$|E
