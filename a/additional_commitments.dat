Development was slowed by an industry downturn {{during the early}} 2000s. The first model {{to emerge from the}} program, the 777-300ER, was launched with an order for ten aircraft from Air France, along with <b>additional</b> <b>commitments.</b> On February 24, 2003, the -300ER made its first flight, and the FAA and EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency, successor to the JAA) certified the model on March 16, 2004. The first delivery to Air France took place on April 29, 2004. The -300ER, which combined the -300's added capacity with the -200ER's range, became the top-selling 777 variant in the late 2000s, benefitting as airlines replaced comparable four-engine models with twinjets for their lower operating costs.|$|E

40|$|Scheduling <b>additional</b> <b>commitments</b> for {{policies}} affecting {{trade in}} goods in the GATT {{has been plagued by}} two sources of ambiguity: the treatment of changes introduced unilaterally by members subsequent to an initial commitment, and the treatment of new commitments by WTO members pertaining to nontariff policy measures affecting {{trade in goods}}. This is not the case for trade in services, as the GATS makes explicit provision for <b>additional</b> <b>commitments</b> to be scheduled. Neither secondary law, in the form of decisions formally adopted by the WTO membership, nor case law has clarified the situation for trade in goods. This matter is important for the WTO as it determines the feasibility of clubs of countries agreeing to new enforceable policy disciplines that bind only signatories but are applied on a non-discriminatory basis to all WTO members.

40|$|Working-class {{students}} {{tend to be less}} socially integrated at university than middle-class students. The present research investigated two potential reasons for this working-class social exclusion effect.

Second, working-class {{students tend}} to be older than middle-class students and, consequently, they are likely to have more work and/or childcare commitments. These <b>additional</b> <b>commitments</b> may prevent them from attending campus which, in turn, reduces their opportunity for social integration.

40|$|Abstract—People-driven service engagements involve {{communication}} over channels such as chat and email. Such engagements {{should be}} understood {{at the level of}} the commitments that the participants create and manipulate. Doing so provides a grounding for the communications and yields a business-level accounting of the progress of a service engagement. Existing work on commitment-based service engagements is limited to designtime model creation and verification. In contrast, we present a novel approach for capturing commitment-based engagements that are created dynamically in conversations. We monitor commitments identifying their creation, delegation, completion, or cancellation in the conversations. We have developed a prototype and evaluated it on real-world chat and email datasets. Our prototype captures commitments with a high F-measure of 90 % in emails (Enron email corpus) and 80 % in chats (HP IT support chat dataset) and provides promising results for capturing <b>additional</b> <b>commitment</b> operations.
