40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the correlation of attachment and self-esteem to social <b>adjustment</b> <b>on</b> victims of bullying. Bullying victims encounter adverse effects that can prolong until adulthood. They also experience poor social adjustment. Good social adjustment associated with self-esteem. A warm and rewarding parenting practices facilitate high self-esteem. Emotional closeness creates strong bonds. Therefore attachment influences {{the formation of a}} sense of security for the survival of the child’s life in the future. The study population is students who were also bullying victims. The participants were 50 students that were identified using purposive sampling technique. The Social Adjustment Scale, the Attachment Scale, and the Self-Esteem Scale were used to collect data. The results of multiple regression analysis indicated that attachment and self-esteem predict social <b>adjustment</b> <b>on</b> victims of bullying  (F(2, 47) = 5, 576; p = 0, 007; R 2 = 0, 192). Partially, attachment predicts social <b>adjustment</b> <b>on</b> victims of bullying (F(1, 48) = 5, 201; p = 0, 027; R 2 = 0, 098) and self-esteem predicts social <b>adjustment</b> <b>on</b> victims of bullying (F(1, 48) = 10, 713; p = 0, 002; R 2 = 0, 182) ...|$|R

40|$|Nominal wage {{adjustment}} is modeled as resulting from bargaining between a risk neutral …rm and a risk averse worker, {{in an environment}} where the rate of in‡ation is a random variable. Risk aversion makes for endogenous indexation arrangements, which deliver partial indexation as they exploit imperfect in‡ation indices; risk aversion also generates a positive correlation between indexation and in‡ation variance. The model suggests a distinction between complete vs incomplete in‡ation <b>adjustment</b> <b>on</b> the one hand, and perfect vs imperfect <b>adjustment</b> <b>on</b> the other hand...|$|R
