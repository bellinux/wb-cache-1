5|$|Credited as Lucille LeSueur, {{her first}} film was Lady of the Night in 1925, {{as the body}} double for MGM's most popular female star, Norma Shearer. She also {{appeared}} in The Circle <b>and</b> <b>Pretty</b> Ladies (both 1925), starring comedian ZaSu Pitts. This was soon followed by equally small and unbilled roles in two other 1925 successes, The Only Thing and The Merry Widow.|$|E
5|$|Mary, however, is {{depicted}} as authentic rather than artificial, detesting fashionable life rather than yearning after it. Mary's charitable works, for example, are not a passing fad: they are a heartfelt reaction to social injustice. Even though she is older and intellectual instead of young <b>and</b> <b>pretty,</b> Mary asserts her right to sexual desire rather than sublimating it.|$|E
5|$|Maggie Roswell {{made her}} acting {{break-through}} in the 1980s with appearances in {{films such as}} Midnight Madness (1980), Lost in America (1985), <b>and</b> <b>Pretty</b> in Pink (1986), and guest appearances on television shows such as Remington Steele, Masquerade, and Happy Days. She appeared frequently in the sketch comedy The Tim Conway Show from 1980 to 1981, and did voice acting for a few animated films and television shows. Roswell also performed in some theater plays, including one in 1988 directed by Julia Sweeney.|$|E

5|$|P. moranensis {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{commonly}} cultivated Pinguicula, in part due to its large size, large <b>and</b> <b>pretty</b> flowers, and the ease with which it can be grown as a container plant. Most growers use an open soil mix composed of some combination of washed sand, perlite, vermiculite, peat moss, gypsum and/or decomposed granite. Soil should be kept well drained, but watered regularly with distilled water in the summer and only very rarely once the plant enters its winter rosette. The species grows readily on well-lit windowsills, under fluorescent lights, or in warm to hot greenhouses.|$|E
5|$|When Harry Dean Stanton {{auditioned for}} Brett, he told Ridley Scott {{he was not}} a fan of science-fiction or horror films; Scott replied that he was not either, but {{expected}} Alien to do well. According to Stanton, he was pleased with the film and said it <b>and</b> <b>Pretty</b> in Pink are the films for which he is best recognized. Several of Brett's scenes were deleted from the original cut, including Ripley and Parker seeing his death and his cocooned corpse in the Alien's lair; they were included in the 2003 director's cut. According to writer Dan O'Bannon, the latter scene hinted that Brett's body was becoming an Alien incubator.|$|E

25|$|According to {{historian}} Jeff Guinn, the hideout photos led to Parker's glamorization and {{the creation}} of legends about the gang. He writes:John Dillinger had matinee-idol good looks <b>and</b> <b>Pretty</b> Boy Floyd had the best possible nickname, but the Joplin photos introduced new criminal superstars with the most titillating trademark of all—illicit sex. Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker were wild and young, and undoubtedly slept together.|$|E
25|$|At this point, the band's {{popularity}} {{began to}} soar as the band, especially Dee and Jay Jay, {{started to talk}} (rap) to the audience about current topics of the day between songs.

25|$|In 1954, Powell {{starred in}} Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, {{opposite}} Howard Keel, which {{gave her the}} opportunity to play a more mature character than in previous films. Her other films include: Rich, Young <b>and</b> <b>Pretty</b> (1951), Small Town Girl (1953), Three Sailors and a Girl (1953), Athena (1954), Deep in My Heart (1954), Hit the Deck (1955) and The Girl Most Likely (1957).|$|E
25|$|The Roud Folk Song Index lists {{about 60}} names {{for this group}} of songs, most of which refer to this variant, {{including}} Fause (or False) Sir John, May Colvin (or variants), Go Bring Me Some of Your Mother's Gold, <b>and</b> <b>Pretty</b> Polly). This variant includes Child's C to F, {{and the vast majority}} of versions listed by Roud, including many named Lady Isabel and the Elf-knight or variants thereon.|$|E
25|$|The Nutcracker, on {{the other}} hand, is one of Tchaikovsky's best known works. While it has been criticized as the least {{substantial}} of the composer's three ballets, {{it should be remembered}} that Tchaikovsky was restricted by a rigorous scenario supplied by Marius Petipa. This scenario provided no opportunity for the expression of human feelings beyond the most trivial and confined Tchaikovsky mostly within a world of tinsel, sweets and fantasy. Yet, at its best, the melodies are charming <b>and</b> <b>pretty,</b> and by this time Tchaikovsky's virtuosity at orchestration and counterpoint ensured an endless fascination in the surface attractiveness of the score.|$|E

25|$|This period {{also saw}} the {{beginning}} of the feud between French and Smith-Dorrien, his successor at Aldershot with whom he had been on relatively cordial terms {{at the end of the}} Boer War. Smith-Dorrien annoyed French by insisting that cavalry improve their musketry, by abolishing the pickets which trawled the streets for drunken soldiers, by more than doubling the number of playing fields available to the men, by cutting down trees, and by building new and better barracks. By 1910 the feud was common knowledge throughout the Army. Smith-Dorrien, happily married to a young <b>and</b> <b>pretty</b> wife, also objected to French’s womanising.|$|E
25|$|Line A {{was inaugurated}} on 4November 1910, after being {{postponed}} because of floods in January that year. Line B was inaugurated on 26February 1911. Because {{of the high}} construction costs, the construction of line C was postponed. Nord-Sud and CMP used compatible trains {{that could be used}} on both networks, but CMP trains used 600 volts third rail, and NS −600 volts overhead wire and +600 volts third rail. This was necessary because of steep gradients on NS lines. NS distinguished itself from its competitor with the high-quality decoration of its stations, the trains' extreme comfort <b>and</b> <b>pretty</b> lighting.|$|E
25|$|For the {{remainder}} of the 1980s, Gere appeared in films of varying critical and commercial reception. His career rebounded with the releases of Internal Affairs (1990) <b>and</b> <b>Pretty</b> Woman (1990), the latter of which earned him his second Golden Globe Award nomination. The 1990s saw Gere star in successful films including Sommersby (1993), Primal Fear (1996) and Runaway Bride (1999) (which reunited him with his Pretty Woman co-star Julia Roberts). He also took {{a leading role in the}} action thriller The Jackal (1997), playing former IRA militant Declan Mulqueen; Gere affected an Irish accent for the role.|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} {{came forward with}} an awkwardness that was more boyish than rustic. His embarrassment was not lessened by the {{simultaneous}} entrance from {{the open door of}} a second woman, apparently as young as <b>and</b> <b>prettier</b> than the first.|$|R
