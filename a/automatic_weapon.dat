5|$|Machine guns: The UN {{required}} the Australians to deploy without the belt-fed M60 machine gun, the standard section-level <b>automatic</b> <b>weapon</b> at the time. Instead, the contingent {{was required to}} deploy with World War II-vintage Bren light machine guns, since these used only a 30-round magazine (the weapons had been rebuilt to accept 7.62mm ammunition).|$|E
5|$|The new gun entered U.S. Army {{service as}} the M249 squad <b>automatic</b> <b>weapon</b> in 1984, and {{was adopted by}} the U.S. Marine Corps a year later. The U.S. {{production}} model has a different butt from that of the regular Minimi. It is manufactured in the FN factory in Columbia, South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} squad <b>automatic</b> <b>weapon</b> in Afghanistan is the M249 with PIP kit, {{which serves}} alongside its heavier counterpart, the M240 machine gun. Most M249s {{were given a}} collapsible buttstock immediately prior to the invasion to reduce its length and make the weapons more practical for parachuting and close-quarters combat. Special Operations troops typically favor the shorter Para version of the weapon, which weighs much less.|$|E

5|$|The M249 {{light machine}} gun (LMG), {{formerly}} designated the M249 Squad <b>Automatic</b> <b>Weapon</b> (SAW) and formally written as Light Machine Gun, 5.56mm, M249, is the American adaptation of the Belgian FN Minimi, a {{light machine gun}} manufactured by the Belgian company FN Herstal (FN). The M249 is manufactured in the United States by the local subsidiary FN Manufacturing LLC in South Carolina and is widely used in the U.S. Armed Forces. The weapon was introduced in 1984 after being judged the most effective {{of a number of}} candidate weapons to address the lack of automatic firepower in small units. The M249 provides infantry squads with the high rate of fire of a machine gun combined with accuracy and portability approaching that of a rifle.|$|E
5|$|Although {{found to}} be {{reliable}} and accurate, the M249 was considered to present unacceptable hazards {{in the form of}} an exposed hot barrel and sharp edges. There were complaints that the front sight required special adjustment tools. On August 23, 1985, then-U.S. Under Secretary of the Army James R. Ambrose suspended M249 production pending the development of the product improvement program (PIP) intended to fix these problems. Congress deleted funds for the M249 from the Fiscal Year 1986 defense budget, then retroactively set aside the program's prior year's funds from the M249 program for other purposes, including retirement and pay raises. Over 1,100 M249s already issued were to remain in use, but be retrofitted with the PIP kit when it became available. Over 7,000 remaining M249s were to stay in storage at depots until corrective changes could be made. The PIP kit was eventually developed and implemented, and production of the M249 resumed. In 1994 the M249 squad <b>automatic</b> <b>weapon</b> was re-designated the M249 light machine gun.|$|E
5|$|Bleak then {{returned}} to the patrol and attempted to treat more wounded members, but soon thereafter a Chinese hand grenade bounced off the helmet of the soldier standing next to him and landed nearby. Bleak tackled the soldier over and covered him with his larger frame to protect him from the grenade, but neither was injured in the ensuing blast. The patrol then continued on its mission, and was successful in capturing several Chinese prisoners. However, as it descended Hill 499 to return to UN lines, they were ambushed by another group of Chinese hidden in a trench with an <b>automatic</b> <b>weapon.</b> Three of the other soldiers were wounded in the attack, and as Bleak attempted to run to them, he was hit in the leg. Bleak dressed all four wounds, but one of the men had been hit too critically to move. In spite of continued Chinese fire and his own injury, Bleak picked up the wounded soldier and began to carry him down the hill.|$|E
50|$|Closed-bolt {{designs are}} often used in rifles. The {{improved}} accuracy of closed-bolt weapons is more desirable, while the poorer heat dissipation is less of an issue for slower-firing weapons. In contrast, open-bolt designs are more often used in <b>automatic</b> <b>weapons,</b> such as machine guns. For fast-firing <b>automatic</b> <b>weapons,</b> heat will rapidly build up from sustained firing, but accuracy is of less importance. Thus, the improved heat dissipation of open-bolt designs is generally more desirable in <b>automatic</b> <b>weapons.</b>|$|R

25|$|A {{mechanism}} to enable an <b>automatic</b> <b>weapon</b> to fire between the blades of a whirling propeller is usually called an interrupter or synchronizer gear. Both these terms {{are more or}} less misleading, at least in so far as explaining what happens when the gear functions.|$|E
25|$|At about 9:30p.m. on June 18, 1984, Berg {{returned}} to his Adams Street townhouse after a dinner date with Judith, with whom he was attempting reconciliation. Berg stepped out of his black Volkswagen Beetle and gunfire erupted. He was struck 12 times. The murder weapon, a semi-automatic Ingram MAC-10, which had been illegally converted to an <b>automatic</b> <b>weapon,</b> was later traced {{to the home of}} one of The Order's members by the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Hostage Rescue Team.|$|E
25|$|Firing {{tests showed}} that the M14, when {{equipped}} with the selector switch, hinged buttplate and bipod, performed {{as well as the}} M15. As a result, the M15 was dropped and the modified M14 became the squad <b>automatic</b> <b>weapon.</b> Accuracy and control problems with this variant led to the addition of a pistol grip, a folding rubber covered metal foregrip and a muzzle stabilizer. However, it was a poor suppressive fire weapon owing to 20-round magazines and it overheated rapidly.|$|E

25|$|On August 5, 2011, Winfield, {{charged with}} premeditated murder and {{conspiracy}} to commit murder, pleaded guilty under a plea deal to involuntary manslaughter and use of an illegal controlled substance. The involuntary manslaughter charge stems from Winfield's failure to intervene and prevent the other soldiers from carrying out the attack against the Afghan in U.S. custody. Under the plea deal he didn't admit to the killing of Mullah Adahdad. He claimed that he fired his <b>automatic</b> <b>weapon</b> away from Adahdad but that he did nothing to stop the murder. He was sentenced to 3 years in prison. He {{was released from prison}} in August 2012.|$|E
25|$|As seen above, {{combustion}} converts {{less than}} half the mass of black powder to gas, most of it turns into particulate matter. Some of it is ejected, wasting propelling power, fouling the air, and generally being a nuisance (giving off a soldier position, generating fog that hinders vision, etc.). Some of it ends up as a thick layer of soot inside the barrel, where it also is a nuisance for subsequent shots, and a cause of jamming an <b>automatic</b> <b>weapon.</b> Moreover this residue is hygroscopic, and with the addition of moisture absorbed from the air forms a corrosive substance. The soot contains potassium oxide or sodium oxide that turns into potassium hydroxide, or sodium hydroxide, which corrodes wrought iron or steel gun barrels. Black powder arms must therefore be well cleaned after use, both inside and out, to remove the residue.|$|E

25|$|On 29 September, after a Qassam rocket hit the Israeli town of Sderot {{and killed}} two Israeli children, the IDF {{launched}} Operation Days of Penitence {{in the north}} of the Gaza Strip. The operation's stated aim was to remove the threat of Qassam rockets from Sderot and kill the Hamas militants launching them. The operation ended on 16 October, leaving widespread destruction and more than 100 Palestinians dead, at least 20 of whom were under the age of 16. Thirteen-year-old Iman Darweesh Al Hams was killed by the IDF when she strayed into a closed military area: the commander was accused of allegedly firing his <b>automatic</b> <b>weapon</b> at her dead body deliberately to verify the death. The act was investigated by the IDF, but the commander was cleared of all wrongdoing, and more recently, was fully vindicated when a Jerusalem district court found the claim to be libellous, ruled that NIS 300,000 be paid by the journalist and TV company responsible for the report, an additional NIS 80,000 to be paid in legal fees and required the journalist and television company to air a correction. According to Palestinian medics, Israeli forces killed at least 62 militants and 42 other Palestinians believed to be civilians. According to a count performed by Haaretz, 87 militants and 42 civilians were killed. Palestinian refugee camps were heavily damaged by the Israeli assault. The IDF announced that at least 12 Qassam launchings had been thwarted and many terrorists hit during the operation.|$|E
