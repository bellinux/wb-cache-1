5|$|The semi-legendary Alexander Romance <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> that Alexander {{suffered}} from heterochromia iridum: that one eye {{was dark and}} the other light.|$|E
5|$|Existing {{evidence}} suggests that water fluoridation reduces tooth decay. Consistent evidence <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> that it causes dental fluorosis, most of which is mild and not usually of aesthetic concern. No clear evidence of other adverse effects exists, though almost all research thereof has been of poor quality.|$|E
5|$|Nozaki <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> {{that the}} word kitsune was {{originally}} onomatopoetic. Kitsu represented a fox's yelp and came to be the general word for fox. -Ne signifies an affectionate mood.|$|E
50|$|Long-term {{stress is}} <b>also</b> <b>suggested.</b>|$|R

25|$|A {{relationship}} between the Brachiopoda and Nemertea has been suggested by molecular data. A second study has <b>also</b> <b>suggested</b> this relationship. This latter study <b>also</b> <b>suggested</b> that Annelida and Mollusca may be sister clades. Another study has suggested that Annelida and Mollusca are sister clades. This clade has been termed the Neotrochozoa.|$|R
5|$|Recent polls {{suggest that}} 4.5 {{million people were}} irreligious in 2013. The same data <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> that 85% of all irreligious people are younger than 35.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} {{identified as}} Mac Ragnaill (son of Ragnall) by the annals {{may have been}} Ragnall's son, though no name is given. In 942 Mac Ragnaill led a raid on Downpatrick, but within a week {{he was killed by}} Matudán, Overking of Ulster. The Annals of the Four Masters call Mac Ragnaill a jarl, but the Annals of Ulster call him a king. The Annals of the Four Masters <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> he and his fellow plunderers came from an island.|$|E
5|$|Circumcision {{may be used}} {{to treat}} {{pathological}} phimosis, refractory balanoposthitis and chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). The World Health Organization promotes circumcision to prevent female-to-male HIV transmission in countries with high rates of HIV. The International Antiviral Society-USA <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> circumcision be discussed with MSM who engage in primarily insertive anal sex, especially in areas where HIV is common.|$|E
25|$|Genetic and {{prognostic}} studies <b>also</b> <b>suggest</b> a {{role for}} cystatin C.|$|R
50|$|Autoimmune {{mechanisms}} are <b>also</b> <b>suggested</b> {{as a cause}} for dilated cardiomyopathy.|$|R
50|$|There are <b>also</b> <b>suggested</b> {{plans to}} connect Orkney Mainland to Shapinsay.|$|R
5|$|Conservapedia's {{article on}} {{evolution}} presents evolution as a naturalistic theory that lacks support and that conflicts with {{evidence in the}} fossil record that creationists perceive to support creationism. The entry <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> that sometimes the Bible has been more scientifically correct than the scientific community. Schlafly has defended the statement as presenting an alternative to evolution.|$|E
5|$|David Paul Zorc, a {{linguist}} {{from the}} Australian National University whose expertise is on Philippine languages, notes that Asi speakers {{may have been}} the first Visayan speakers in the Romblon region. He <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> that Asi may have a Cebuano substratum and that many of its words may have been influenced by the later influx of other languages such as Romblomanon.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{does not}} mention {{specific}} figures for casualties, merely saying that losses were heavy on both sides. The Sicyonians in particular suffered, also losing their general Perilaus. On the Persian side, the admiral Mardontes and the general Tigranes were both killed, though Artayntes escaped. Herodotus says that a few Persians troops escaped the battle and {{made their way to}} Sardis. Diodorus claims that there were 40,000 Persian casualties, and <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> that the survivors made their way to Sardis.|$|E
50|$|Some {{cases of}} body-focused {{repetitive}} behaviors <b>also</b> <b>suggest</b> a hereditary factor.|$|R

5|$|His biographer, Brian Little, {{suggests}} that {{this might have been}} a way for the newcomers to become part of Bristol maritime society, as well as making it possible for Woodes Rogers to become a freeman, or voting citizen, of the city. Little <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> that it is likely that Rogers gained his maritime experience with Yeamans' ship on the Newfoundland fleet. Rogers completed his apprenticeship in November 1704.|$|E
5|$|Martial <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> {{the rape}} of a woman by a bull in a re-creation of the myth of Pasiphaë. Nero had {{provided}} a similar entertainment at an event he had staged using an actor dressed in the costume of a bull, though Martial claims that the act performed at the inaugural games was authentic.|$|E
5|$|Ragtime was a {{style of}} dance music based around the piano, using syncopated rhythms and chromaticisms; the genre's most {{well-known}} performer and composer was undoubtedly Scott Joplin. Donald Clarke considers ragtime the culmination of coon songs, used first in minstrel shows and then vaudeville, {{and the result of}} the rhythms of minstrelsy percolating into the mainstream; he <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> that ragtime's distinctive sound may have come from an attempt to imitate the African American banjo using the keyboard.|$|E
25|$|He <b>also</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that the}} Chinese departing tone derived from earlier *-s.|$|R

5|$|Sergeant's {{books and}} David Lawson's Paul Morphy The Pride and Sorrow of Chess (New York, 1976) make {{extensive}} use of Edge's book, but note Edge's strong anti-Staunton bias. Lawson <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> that Morphy had seen the manuscript of Edge's book, disliked its treatment of the Staunton affair {{so much that he}} disavowed it, and objected to Edge's treatment of other matters.|$|E
5|$|The {{fossil record}} of the Malagasy {{hippopotamus}} is extensive. At least seven hippopotamus bones show unequivocal signs of butchery, suggesting that they survived until humans arrived on Madagascar. The evidence of humans butchering the hippos <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> their extinction may have been, in part, due to humans. Despite the discovery of many fossils, the hippos of Madagascar are not very well studied, perhaps because researchers are interested {{in some of the}} more exotic megafauna of Madagascar, such as the giant lemurs and the elephant birds.|$|E
5|$|Advaita {{literally}} means non-duality, {{and it is}} a monistic {{system of}} thought. It deals with the non-dual nature of Brahman and Atman. Advaita is considered the most influential sub-school of the Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy. Gaudapada {{was the first person to}} expound the basic principles of the Advaita philosophy in a commentary on the conflicting statements of the Upanishads. Gaudapada's Advaita ideas were further developed by Shankara (8th century CE). King states that Gaudapada's main work, Māṇḍukya Kārikā, is infused with philosophical terminology of Buddhism, and uses Buddhist arguments and analogies. King <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> that there are clear differences between Shankara's writings and the Brahmasutra, and many ideas of Shankara are at odds with those in the Upanishads. Radhakrishnan, on the other hand, suggests that Shankara's views of Advaita were straightforward developments of the Upanishads and the Brahmasutra, and many ideas of Shankara derive from the Upanishads.|$|E

5000|$|Excavations at {{the burial}} site of China's first Emperor Qin Shi Huang, {{dating back to}} the 3rd century BC, <b>also</b> <b>suggest</b> Greek {{influence}} in the artworks found there, including in the manufacture of the famous Terracotta army. It is <b>also</b> <b>suggested</b> that Greek artists may have come to China at that time to train local artisans in making sculptures ...|$|R

5|$|Archeological {{evidence}} for {{agriculture in the}} Sangam age has been retrieved from sites such as Mangudi, Kodumanal and Perur, which have yielded charred remains of seeds of crops like rice, millets including pearl millets, pulses and cotton. It has been deduced that agriculture most likely involved dry farming, with additional irrigation for cotton and rice; mixed cropping {{seems to have been}} undertaken to replenish the nitrogen in the soil—this <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> a spread of labour and knowledge of different sowing and harvesting techniques. The presence of cotton seeds indicates the production of a crop aimed at craft production, which is also attested by finds of cotton and spindle whorls at Kodumanal. Remains of structures that resemble an artificial water reservoir have been located at different sites. In Arikamedu, a few terracotta ring-wells were found {{at the bottom of the}} reservoir; it has been suggested that the ring wells were to assure the supply of water during the dry season.|$|E
5|$|Based on parsimony-based phylogenetic analysis, {{the most}} recent common {{ancestor}} of all eukaryotes most likely already possessed an early RNA interference pathway; {{the absence of the}} pathway in certain eukaryotes is thought to be a derived characteristic. This ancestral RNAi system probably contained at least one dicer-like protein, one argonaute, one PIWI protein, and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that may also have played other cellular roles. A large-scale comparative genomics study likewise indicates that the eukaryotic crown group already possessed these components, which may then have had closer functional associations with generalized RNA degradation systems such as the exosome. This study <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> that the RNA-binding argonaute protein family, which is shared among eukaryotes, most archaea, and at least some bacteria (such as Aquifex aeolicus), is homologous to and originally evolved from components of the translation initiation system.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to lead {{may also}} {{decrease}} lifespan and have health {{effects in the}} long term. Death rates {{from a variety of}} causes {{have been found to be}} higher in people with elevated blood lead levels; these include cancer, stroke, and heart disease, and general death rates from all causes. Lead is considered a possible human carcinogen based on evidence from animal studies. Evidence <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> that age-related mental decline and psychiatric symptoms are correlated with lead exposure. Cumulative exposure over a prolonged period may have a more important effect on some aspects of health than recent exposure. Some health effects, such as high blood pressure, are only significant risks when lead exposure is prolonged (over about one year).|$|E
30|$|This {{coincides with}} the AIC and Schwarz criterion, which <b>also</b> <b>suggest</b> one lag.|$|R
