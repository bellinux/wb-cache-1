5|$|Mr. Burns sits in {{his office}} <b>awaiting</b> <b>the</b> union leader, who mysteriously {{disappeared}} after promising {{to clean up the}} union, so that they can discuss the proposed union contract. While perusing the contract, Mr. Burns becomes disgusted with the union demands and reminisces about simpler times in which disgruntled workers were simply walled up in coke ovens. Mr. Burns then decides to take on the union, and revokes their dental plan.|$|E
5|$|The precise {{origins of}} the Kuiper belt and its complex {{structure}} are still unclear, and astronomers are <b>awaiting</b> <b>the</b> completion of several wide-field survey telescopes such as Pan-STARRS and the future LSST, which should reveal many currently unknown KBOs. These surveys will provide data that will help determine answers to these questions.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} will battle against members of Team Rocket, a {{criminal}} organization originally from Kanto. They were originally {{defeated by the}} protagonist of FireRed and LeafGreen, and have attempted to come back as an organization, while <b>awaiting</b> <b>the</b> return of their leader, Giovanni. To attempt to contact him, they take over the radio tower and broadcast a message calling out to him.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally in {{adventure}} game engines, non-player {{characters were}} static <b>awaiting</b> <b>the</b> player {{to interact with}} them to trigger an event. However, Virtual Theatre allowed non-player characters to traverse the world in seemingly random patterns, interacting with their environment. Upon the engine's first release, it rivaled competing engines such as LucasArts' SCUMM engine, and Sierra's Creative Interpreter, due to its then high level of artificial intelligence.|$|E
5|$|After Abraham Lincoln's {{election}} as president, several Southern states announced their secession from the Union {{to form a}} new government, the Confederate States of America. Garfield read military texts while anxiously <b>awaiting</b> <b>the</b> war effort, which he regarded as a holy crusade against the Slave Power. In April 1861, the rebels bombarded Fort Sumter, one of the last federal outposts in the South, beginning the Civil War. Although he had no military training, Garfield knew that his place was in the Union Army.|$|E
5|$|Anticipating {{that the}} Confederates would march on Gettysburg {{from the west}} {{on the morning of}} July 1, Buford laid out his {{defenses}} on three ridges west of the town: Herr Ridge, McPherson Ridge and Seminary Ridge. These were appropriate terrain for a delaying action by his small cavalry division against superior Confederate infantry forces, meant to buy time <b>awaiting</b> <b>the</b> arrival of Union infantrymen who could occupy the strong defensive positions south of town at Cemetery Hill, Cemetery Ridge, and Culp's Hill. Buford understood that if the Confederates could gain control of these heights, Meade's army would have difficulty dislodging them.|$|E

5|$|Ghosh, who co-wrote {{the story}} and the screenplay, began to plan the film while <b>awaiting</b> <b>the</b> release of his {{previous}} film Aladin (2009), but the dismal response to Aladin was a setback. He had to approach several producers to finance him for Kahaani, but was refused and discouraged from making the film owing to three factors: a pregnant woman as the lead star, a bunch of unknown Bengali actors as the supporting cast and Kolkata as a backdrop. Yashraj Films were willing to produce the film, but wanted Ghosh to sign a three-film deal, which he declined {{because he did not}} want that much commitment.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Major Margaret Houlihan (Loretta Swit) and Major Frank Burns (Larry Linville) are eagerly <b>awaiting</b> <b>the</b> {{upcoming}} {{transfer of}} {{command of the}} 4077th MASH: upon Blake's departure, Burns will become the unit commander. Henry and Radar begin {{to clean out the}} main office, sharing a sentimental moment in which Radar tells Blake of his meaning to him. As a token of appreciation and admiration, Radar gives him an inscribed Winchester cartridge; a surprised Henry returns the favor by spontaneously giving Radar a rectal thermometer that once belonged to his father.|$|E
5|$|Muthu, Anitha and Lavanya get {{separated}} from the others. They reach {{the ruins of a}} village where they are subjected to black magic and nearly go mad before reaching the secret hideout of the Chola. The three find an ethnic isolated primitive Tamil group, ruled by a Chola king. The king and his people are in hiding, <b>awaiting</b> <b>the</b> arrival of the fabled messenger who will bring glory and prosperity back to their land and lead them back to Thanjavur, their motherland. The king and the priest consult the gods for omens and order Muthu, Anitha and Lavanya to be burnt alive as sacrifices.|$|E

5|$|On 13 March 1771, Endeavour {{rounded the}} Cape of Good Hope and made port in Cape Town two days later. Those still sick were taken ashore for treatment. The ship {{remained}} in port {{for four weeks}} <b>awaiting</b> <b>the</b> recovery of the crew and undergoing minor repairs to her masts. On 15 April, the sick were brought back on board along with ten recruits from Cape Town, and Endeavour resumed her homeward voyage. The English mainland was sighted on 10 July and Endeavour entered the port of Dover two days later.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of July 1, Union cavalry in the {{division}} of Brig. Gen. John Buford were <b>awaiting</b> <b>the</b> approach of Confederate infantry forces {{from the direction of}} Cashtown, to the northwest. Confederate forces from the brigade of Brig. Gen. J. Johnston Pettigrew had briefly clashed with Union forces the day before but believed they were Pennsylvania militia of little consequence, not the regular army cavalry that was screening the approach of the Army of the Potomac.|$|E
5|$|The {{compilation}} received generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics; {{the album was}} recommended for fans who were <b>awaiting</b> <b>the</b> release of Rihanna's next studio album. Good Girl Gone Bad: The Remixes peaked at number 106 on the Billboard 200 and number four on the Dance/Electronic Albums chart. It was ranked as the 22nd best-selling album of 2009 on the latter chart, and it has sold 49,000 copies in the US to date.|$|E

5|$|While <b>awaiting</b> <b>the</b> first {{delivery}} of stone, Simson {{noticed that the}} battlefield landscape features were beginning to deteriorate. Seeing an opportunity to not only preserve {{a portion of the}} battlefield but also keep his staff occupied, Simson decided to preserve a short section of trench line and make the Grange Subway more accessible. Labourers rebuilt and preserved sections of sandbagged trench wall, on both the Canadian and German sides of the Grange crater group, in concrete. The workforce also built a new concrete entrance for the Grange Subway and, after excavating a portion of the tunnel system, installed electric lighting.|$|E
5|$|According to custom, pretenders to {{the throne}} had {{historically}} been put to death upon the naming of a new sovereign. Radama was opposed to this practice and asked the brothers to help ensure his accession {{to the throne}} with minimum bloodshed {{on the day of}} the queen's death. Rainilaiarivony successfully maintained authority over the palace guards anxiously <b>awaiting</b> <b>the</b> command from either faction to slaughter the other. When the queen's attendant quietly informed him that her final moments were approaching, Rainilaiarivony discreetly summoned Radama and Rainivoninahitriniony from the Prime Minister's palace to the royal Rova compound and ordered the prince crowned before the gathered soldiers, just as the queen was pronounced dead. Ramboasalama was promptly escorted to the palace where he was obliged to publicly swear allegiance to King Radama.|$|E
5|$|Amelia and Kanyenke next {{fight the}} Circle at their last stronghold in Cuba, and, after allying with the Spanish colony of Havana and <b>awaiting</b> <b>the</b> {{arrival of the}} U.S. Navy, they destroy the Ossuary and the fixed guns {{guarding}} it. As the battle is ending, Amelia and Kanyenke pass under an archway in which Beaumont is concealed. Beaumont jumps down and attempts to stab Amelia but Kanyenke pushes {{her out of the}} way. All three tumble to the ground. Beaumont charges at Amelia, about to stab her, but when Beaumont gets near, Amelia kicks him and pushes him backwards. He quickly charges at her again, but she grabs her shotgun and shoots him. Amelia later uses the Circle's stored treasure to revive the Falcon Company and succeeds in building railroads to the west coast.|$|E
