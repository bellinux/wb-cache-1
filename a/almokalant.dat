40|$|The {{electrophysiologic}} {{effects of}} intravenously administered <b>almokalant,</b> {{a new class}} III antiarrhythmic drug, in 7 isoflurane-anesthetized pigs after low and high dose were investigated. Low-dose <b>almokalant</b> included bolus infusion of 0. 05 mu mol/kg/min for 5 min followed by a continuous infusion of 0. 0025 mu mol/kg/min for 40 min. Thereafter, a high dose of 0. 2 mu mol/kg/min for 5 min and 0. 01 mu mol/kg/min for 40 min was given. PR, QRS, AH, and HV intervals did not change during <b>almokalant</b> administration. The QT interval increased dose dependently from 337 +/- 17 to 442 +/- 20 ms at high dose (p < 0. 05). Atrial refractory periods (AERP) were prolonged dose dependently at a 500 -ms pacing cycle length from 178 +/- 15 at baseline to 227 +/- 27 and 253 +/- 23 ms during low- and high-dose <b>almokalant</b> infusion, respectively. For pacing cycle lengths of 400 and 300 ms, these values were 180 +/- 11, 207 +/- 25, and 259 +/- 34 and 157 +/- 12, 193 +/- 21, and 234 +/- 28 ms, respectively. At a pacing cycle length of 500 ms, mean ventricular effective refractory period (VERP) was 270 +/- 25 ms as compared with 306 +/- 24 and 337 +/- 17 during low and high dose, respectively. A similar pattern of VERP changes during both low- and high-dose infusion was noted at the shorter pacing cycle lengths, with an increase from 240 +/- 23 to 274 +/- 22 and 279 +/- 24 ms during a 400 -ms cycle length and from 210 +/- 17 to 235 +/- 19 and 234 +/- 21 ms during a 300 -ms cycle length. The ratio of the VERP and ventricular monophasic action potential duration (VAPD) did not change significantly. The Wenckebach cycle length increased by 36 +/- 36 and 83 +/- 37 ms with low- and high-dose <b>almokalant</b> infusion, respectively. The percent increase of AERP at pacing cycle lengths of 500, 400, and 300 ms during high-dose <b>almokalant</b> was 42, 44, and 49 %, respectively; these increases for VERP were 25, 16, and 11 %, respectively. In conclusion, prolongation of refractoriness by <b>almokalant</b> was more pronounced at the atrial than the ventricular level. Prolongation of refractoriness was maintained at short pacing cycle lengths especially in the atrium, indicating absence of reverse-use dependence of <b>almokalant</b> in the porcine heart.

In this group of patients, Class I drugs were shown to be ineffective, and they even increased mortality during chronic treatment.

In the present study, the electrophysiological, rate dependent and autonomic effects of intravenously administered <b>almokalant,</b> a new Class III antiarrhythmic drug, were investigated in nine pigs surviving a myocardial infarction. The ventricular effective refractory period (VERP) increased after <b>almokalant</b> (loading dose: 0. 05 mu mol. kg(- 1). min(- 2), continuous infusion: 0. 0025 mu mol. kg(- 1). min(- 1)) from 292 +/- 25 to 308 +/- 13 ms (pacing cycle length [PCL] 500 ms + 1 extrasystole [ES], from 249 +/- 19 to 261 +/- 16 ms (PCL 400 ms + 1 ES), and from 209 +/- 1 8 to 219 +/- 18 ms (PCL 300 ms + 1 ES). The VERPs increased most after three ES at PCL 400 ms: from 167 +/- 27 to 186 +/- 29 ms IP < 0. 05) and at PCL 300 ms: from 159 +/- 29 to 174 +/- 27 ms (P < 0. 05). The ventricular monophasic action potential durations (MAPD) were similarly prolonged and the ratio VERP/MAPD did not change. Prolongation of MAPD after <b>almokalant</b> remained present at short pacing cycle lengths. Before <b>almokalant</b> infusion, sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) was inducible in two pigs, and nonsustained VT in a third animal. After <b>almokalant,</b> only one pig remained inducible. Two weeks after myocardial infarction, heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity were reduced.

40|$|The {{interest}} in class III drugs has {{increased over the}} last decades as being potent antiarrhythmic agents in their mode of action by prolongation of repolarization and with no effect on conduction. Class I antiarrhythmic agents have proven effective in conversion of atrial fibrillation (AF), but may cause serious proarrhythmia. Older class III drugs, i. e. amiodarone and sotalol, are also afflicted with adverse effects, which limit their use. However, the pure class III antiarrhythmic drugs, potassium channel blockers, may also induce proarrhythmia, i. e. torsades de pointes (TdP). <b>Almokalant</b> is a selective potassium - Ikr- channel blocker. The aims of the present thesis were to assess the antiarrhythmic and proarrhythmic effects of a 6 -hour infusion of <b>almokalant</b> when given to 100 patients with chronic AF or flutter (AFL) aiming at conversion to sinus rhythm (SR), and to find predictors of conversion, and development of TdP in case it should occur. On the following day an identical infusion was given for 90 minutes during SR to 61 of the patients. Paper I evaluated the efficacy of <b>almokalant</b> in conversion of AF or AFL to SR. A second aim was to find predictors of conversion to SR. The electrophysiological effects of <b>almokalant</b> were assessed by surface 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and transesophageal atrial electrograms (TAE). Thirty-two patients converted to SR. The ECG changes observed were consistent with a class III effect. The QT, corrected QT, QTtop intervals and QT dispersion increased, the T wave amplitude and atrial rate decreased, with no differences between patients converting to SR {{and those who did}} not. A decrease in T wave amplitude early during infusion was a predictor of conversion to SR. Paper II assessed the proarrhythmic effect of <b>almokalant</b> and ECG variables associated with TdP. Six patients developed TdP, five of these after conversion to SR. Patients who developed TdP were characterized by an abnormal ventricular repolarization when exposed to the drug and, soon after the start of infusion, developed a pronounced QT prolongation, a larger QT dispersion, and marked morphological T wave changes. These ECG changes were observed during AF, as well as after conversion to SR, before the proarrhythmic event. Predictors of TdP were at baseline: female gender, PVCs, diuretics and, after 30 minutes of infusion, the development of sequential bilateral bundle branch aberrancy, PVCs in bigeminy, and a biphasic T wave. Paper III assessed QT dispersion, as a measure of the inhomogeneity of ventricular repolarization, during AF and SR in sixty-one patients, who received <b>almokalant</b> infusion on both study days. QT dispersion did not differ during AF and SR at normal ventricular repolarization. At prolonged repolarization, QT dispersion was larger during SR than during AF. QT dispersion was not related to the QT or RR interval or <b>almokalant</b> plasma concentration. Increased QT dispersion may contribute to the increased risk of TdP shortly after conversion to SR. Paper IV evaluated the occurrence of aberrant conduction during AF at rest and during exercise prior to and during <b>almokalant</b> infusion in 92 of the patients. <b>Almokalant</b> caused a marked, and dose-related, {{increase in the number of}} patients with intermittent aberration during rest, which was further increased during exercise. Predictors of the development of aberrant conduction on <b>almokalant</b> were decreased left ventricular ejection fraction, female gender, longer arrhythmia duration, while the use of calcium antagonists decreased the risk.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{sought to}} further {{elucidate}} {{the role of}} early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and interventricular dispersion of repolarization (ΔAPD) in the genesis of acquired torsade de pointes (TdP) arrhythmias. Background. Administration of class III agents {{can be associated with}} TdP. We developed a dog model in which TdP can be reproducibly induced by pacing after d-sotalol. This model shows reproducible results over weeks. Methods. In 14 anesthetized dogs with chronic complete atrioventricular block, two separate experiments were performed in which d-sotalol (2 mg/kg body weight) or <b>almokalant</b> (0. 12 mg/kg) was administered. Monophasic action potentials were simultaneously recorded from the endocardium of the right and left ventricle to register EADs and to measure the action potential duration (APD). ΔAPD was defined as the APD of the left ventricle minus that of the right ventricle. Results. Baseline conditions were identical in the serially performed experiments. The cycle length and QT time increased by 16 % and 26 % after d-sotalol and by 15 % and 31 % after <b>almokalant,</b> respectively. After both drugs the action potential of the left ventricle prolonged more than that of the right ventricle, thereby increasing ΔAPD (<b>almokalant</b> [mean ± SD]: 110 ± 60 ms; d-sotalol: 80 ± 45 ms, p < 0. 05). The incidence of EADs (18 of 22 vs. 11 of 24, p < 0. 05) and single ectopic beats (EBs) (1. 5 ± 2 vs. 24 ± 32, p < 0. 01) was more frequently observed after <b>almokalant</b> than after d-sotalol. Moreover, multiple EBs only occurred after <b>almokalant.</b> These beats interfered with the basic rhythm, leading to dynamic changes in left ventricular APD and to additional increases in ΔAPD. Spontaneous TdP was observed in 9 of 14 dogs after <b>almokalant</b> and could be increased to 12 of 14 with programmed electrical stimulation. After d-sotalol, TdP could only be induced by programmed electrical stimulation (5 of 14, p < 0. 05). Conclusions. In the same dog, <b>almokalant</b> induced more delay in repolarization, more EADs, multiple EBs and more ventricular inhomogeneity in APD than d-sotalol. These changes were related to a higher incidence of TdP and thereby confirm a strong association of the occurrence of EADs, multiple EBs and ΔAPD in the genesis of TdP. These findings also show the possible value of our model for evaluating the proarrhythmic potential of different drugs...|$|E
40|$|A voltage-clamp {{analysis}} {{of the effect of}} <b>almokalant</b> on the delayed rectifier K ' current (IK) was made in rabbit ventricular myocytes. The two-suction pipette method was used, and appropriate voltage-clamp protocols were used to study more specifically use dependence, block development, and recovery from block. <b>Almokalant</b> interacted with the IK in two ways: it shifted the activation curve in the hyperpolarizing direction (stimulatory effect) and blocked the open lK channel in a use-dependent way (inhibitory effect). For 2 -second voltage clamps to + 20 mV, half-maximum block was obtained at 5 x 10 - 8 mol/L, with a Hill coefficient of 1. 76. Use-dependent block was related to an open-channel block that occurred at 0 mV with a time constant of 1. 07 second and a rather slow recovery from block. at- 50 mV, recovery time constant was ~ 10 seconds; at- 75 mV, recovery was practically absent. The absence of an important recovery at negative membrane potentials is consistent with the hypothesis of the drug being trapped in the channel. A limited frequency-dependent block could be demonstrated. Use-dependent unblock was demonstrated by a rapid recovery from block during stimulation following complete washout of the drug. It is concluded that <b>almokalant</b> shifts the activation curve of IK in the hyperpolarizing direction, blocks the open channel, and is trapped by the closure of the activation gate.

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} of the I-kr-blocker <b>almokalant</b> attempting to convert chronic atrial tachyarrhythmias, and to find predictors of conversion, to sinus rhythm. Methods: The electrophysiological effects of a 6 -hour infusion of <b>almokalant,</b> to a total dose of 25 +/- 4 mg, were assessed by ECG and transesophageal atrial electrograms (TAE) in 100 consecutive patients with atrial fibrillation / flutter (n = 95 / 5) of 8 +/- 12 months' duration (range 1 to 99 months). Results: The conversion rate was 32 %. The time to conversion was 3. 5 +/- 2. 2 hours.

The following day, after conversion to sinus rhythm, by <b>almokalant</b> (n = 19) or direct current cardioversion (n = 42), an identical 90 min infusion was administered. Prior to infusion, there was no difference in precordial QT dispersion between atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm (29 +/- 12 vs 36 +/- 17 ms, P = ns).

40|$|During {{the last}} years, drugs that prolong the repolarisation {{phase of the}} {{myocardial}} action potential, due to inhibition of the rapid component of the delayed-rectifying potassium channel (IKr) have been in focus. In addition to arrhythmogenic potential, selective Ikr-blockers have {{also been shown to}} be embryotoxic and teratogenic in animal studies. The aim of this thesis was to investigate a theory that these developmental toxic results from pharmacologically induced episodes of embryonic cardiac arrhythmias leading to hypoxia related damage in the embryo. <b>Almokalant</b> (ALM) was used as a model compound for selective Ikr-blockers. ALM induced embryonic cardiac arrhythmia, and in similarity with results obtained by maternal hypoxia, ALM induced embryonic death and growth retardation in both rats, and mice. The theory of a hypoxia-related mechanism was strengthened by the results that ALM induce phase specific external and visceral defects (e. g. cleft lip/palate, distal digital, cardiovascular, and urogenital defects), and that the skeletal defects (not shown before) showed a clear trend; the later the treatment the more caudal was the site of the defect, which is in accordance with results from maternal hypoxia induced by e. g. lowering of the O 2 content in the air.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{ventricular}} {{action potential}} exhibits regional heterogeneity in configuration and duration (APD). Across the left ventricular (LV) free wall, this {{is explained by}} differences in repolarizing K+ currents. However, the ionic basis of electrical nonuniformity in the right ventricle (RV) versus the LV is poorly investigated. We examined transient outward (ITO 1), delayed (IKs and IKr), and inward rectifier K+ currents (IK 1) in relation to action potential characteristics of RV and LV midmyocardial (M) cells of the same adult canine hearts. METHODS AND RESULTS: Single RV and LV M cells were used for microelectrode recordings and whole-cell voltage clamping. Action potentials showed deeper notches, shorter APDs at 50 % and 95 % of repolarization, and less prolongation on slowing of the pacing rate in RV than LV. ITO 1 density was significantly larger in RV than LV, whereas steady-state inactivation and rate of recovery were similar. IKs tail currents, measured at - 25 mV and insensitive to <b>almokalant</b> (2 micromol/L), were considerably larger in RV than LV. IKr, measured as almokalant-sensitive tail currents at - 50 mV, and IK 1 were not different in the 2 ventricles. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in K+ currents may well explain the interventricular heterogeneity of action potentials in M layers of the canine heart. These results contribute to a further phenotyping of the ventricular action potential under physiological conditions. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In the {{dog with}} chronic {{complete}} atrioventricular block (AVB), torsade de pointes arrhythmias (TdP) can be induced reproducibly by class III antiarrhythmic agents. In vivo studies reveal important electrophysiological alterations of the heart at 5 weeks of AVB, resulting in increased proarrhythmia. Autopsy studies indicate the presence of biventricular hypertrophy. In this study, the cellular basis of proarrhythmia and hypertrophy in chronic AVB was investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: From chronic-AVB dogs with increased heart weights and TdP, left midmyocardial and right ventricular myocytes were isolated by enzymatic dispersion. These myocytes were significantly larger than sinus rhythm (SR) controls. In chronic AVB, the action potential spike-and-dome configuration was preserved. However, the action potential duration (APD) at 95 % and 50 % of repolarization of the left midmyocardium was significantly larger in chronic AVB than in SR, with little change in the right ventricle, causing enhanced interventricular dispersion of repolarization at slow pacing rates. Treatment with the class III agent <b>almokalant</b> increased the APD to a much larger extent in chronic-AVB than in SR myocytes and resulted in {{a higher incidence of}} early afterdepolarizations (EADs). EADs had their takeoff potential between - 35 and 0 mV. There was no evidence that spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + release underlies these EADs. CONCLUSIONS: In the dog, chronic AVB leads to hypertrophy of both right and left ventricular myocytes. The repolarization abnormalities predisposing for class III-dependent TdP in vivo are the results of cellular electrophysiological remodeling. status: publishe...|$|E

A comprehensive assessment of their electrical phenotype upon differentiation is essential to predict potential future applications of this cell source. CMPCs isolated from human fetal heart were differentiated in vitro and examined using immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, RT-PCR, voltage clamp and current clamp techniques. Differentiated cultures presented up to 95 % alpha-actinin positive cardiomyocytes. Adherens junction and desmosomal proteins beta-catenin, N-cadherin, desmin and plakophilin 2 were upregulated. Expression levels of cardiac connexins were not affected by differentiation, however Cx 43 phosphorylation was increased upon differentiation, accompanied by translocation of connexins to the cell border. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated upregulation of all major cardiac ion channel constituents during differentiation. Patch clamp experiments showed that cardiomyocytes had a stable resting membrane potential of - 73. 4 +/- 1. 8 mV. Infusion of 1 mM BaCl(2) resulted in depolarization to - 59. 9 +/- 2. 8 mV, indicating I(K 1) channel activity.

40|$|From our {{everyday}} life, {{we know that}} our hearts beat with a rhythm which is not perfectly periodic. Even an isolated spontaneously beating cardiac cell, devoid of neural, hormonal, and intracardiac regulatory input, does not beat perfectly regularly. I investigate {{the hypothesis that the}} beat-to-beat fluctuations in transmembrane potential of spontaneously beating cardiac cells are due to stochastic gating of the ionic channels in the cell membrane. Recordings of transmembrane potential from small clusters of spontaneously beating 7 -day-old embryonic chick ventricular cells were analyzed to characterize the voltage waveform and the regularity of beating. I constructed a deterministic Hodgkin-Huxley-type ionic model which reproduces spontaneous activity in our experimental recordings, as well as the experimental results of applying various ion channel blockers (D- 600, <b>almokalant,</b> and Ba 2 +). The model consists of six currents: a calcium current (ICa), three potassium currents (IKs, I Kr, IK 1), a background current (Ib), and a seal-leak current (I seal). The deterministic Hodgkin-Huxley-type model was then reformulated into a stochastic single-channel model. The single-channel model reproduces the irregularity of beating seen experimentally: e. g. the coefficient of variation of interbeat interval was 4. 4 % vs. 3. 9 % in the clusters. In the model, IKs is the current giving the major contributions to fluctuations in interbeat interval. Phase resetting of the spontaneous activity of cardiac pacemaker cells by a brief stimulus pulse was simulated in Hodgkin-Huxley-type models and single-channel models of slow-upstroke (central) and fast-upstroke (peripheral) rabbit sinoatrial node cells. In the Hodgkin-Huxley-type models the phase-resetting response is continuous, but can be extremely delicate in the fast-upstroke model, in that a tiny difference in the stimulus timing can change the stimulus response from a delayed action potential to an advanced one. Therefore, the noise in the fast-upstroke single-channel model can cause a stimulus with fixed amplitude and fixed timing to have widely different effects: sometimes it will induce an action potential but in other cases it will delay an action potential, as seen previously in experiments on cardiac preparations...|$|E

We have developed a chronic AV block dog model in which after d-sotalol (dS) TdP can be reproducibly induced by pacing. The response is also reproducible over weeks. In this model of TdP we compared the proarrhythmic effect of d-sotalol (2 mg/kg) and <b>Almokalant</b> (A, 0. 12 mg/kg) in the same dog. In 7 anesthetized dogs with chronic AV block (4 ± 2 wksl dS was administered, and A in a second experiment (4 ± 1. 6 wks later). In 517 dogs monophasic action potentials were endocardially recorded in the right and in the left ventricle (RV, LV) to register EADs and to measure the action potential duration (APD). Dispersion of repolarization (ΔAPD) was defined as LV APD – RV APDResultsBaseline conditions were identical in the two experiments in the same dog (cycle length of the idioventricular rhythm, CL-IVR: 1620 ± 335 ms. 0 T: 405 ± 50 ms. LV APD: 385 ± 40 ms, RVAPD: 340 ± 32 ms, ΔAPD: 45 ± 25 ms). The CL-IVR and OT time increased with resp. 20 and 27 % after dS and with 20 and 34 % after A. EADs were more frequently observed after A (5151 than after dS (3 / 5). Induction of TdP {{was more frequently seen}} after A: spontaneous TdP was observed in 417 dogs, the incidence increased to 517 after pacing. After dS TdP was only induced by pacing (217). Induction was found to be related to ΔAPD. After both drugs the LV APD increased more than the RV APD. LV APD after A (575 ms) was also longer than OT time (550 ms). The ΔAPD increased more after A than dS (40 ± 18 to 125 ± 95 ms vs 45 ± 30 to 85 ± 70 ms. P< 0. 05). Conclusions. A induced more EADs and led to a larger ΔAPD than dS in the same dog. These changes were related to a higher incidence of TdP. The findings show the value of our model to evaluate TdP induction by different drugs...|$|E
40|$|Prediction {{of human}} drug {{metabolism}} in vivo {{by use of}} in vitro systems is of immense importance in drug development since it allows avoidance of drugs coming out on the market that are subjected to interindividual variability in metabolism or causes drug-drug interactions, both of which in turn can lead to adverse drug reactions and result in non-optimal treatment. In the present investigations the importance of P 450 haplotype on substrate specificity was studied {{as well as a}} comparison of different in vitro systems for optimal prediction of in vivo drug metabolism. Regions important for membrane interactions of one form of P 450 were elucidated in order to engineer a soluble form of the enzyme of use for crystallization studies. A new CYP 2 D 6 allele (CYP 2 D 6 * 17) common in Black African populations carrying three mutations Thrl 07 IIe, Arg 296 Cys and Ser 486 Thr was investigated by recombinant expression and the enzyme characterized using CYP 2 D 6 specific substrates. It was found that both the Thrl 07 IIe, Arg 296 Cys substitutions were required in order to yield an enzyme with altered substrate specificity in a manner seen in vivo, emphasizing the necessity to consider haplotypes rather than single SNPs for functional analyses of many polymorphic genes. Various in vitro systems like homology models of P 450 enzymes, recombinant enzymes, liver microsomes, hepatocyte primary cultures and liver slices were compared with respect to predictability of in vivo metabolism of 3 different drugs in the EUROCYP project where I was responsible for the recombinant enzyme systems using yeast. The expression systems were optimized for nine different human CYPs. It was found that the recombinant system under-predicted the overall clearance of <b>almokalant,</b> mainly being a substrate for UDP-glucuronosyltransferases. For carbamazepine, only CYP 3 A 4 among the 9 different forms of P 450 examined was active. The addition of cytochrome b 5 lead to a overestimated clearance putting emphasis on the composition of cofactors when dealing with CYP 3 A 4. For selegiline we found that, in contrast to previous studies, CYP 2 B 6 and CYP 2 C 19 were the most active enzymes, but some contribution from CYP 1 A 2 and CYP 3 A 4 was also predicted. Scaling up our recombinant data to the human situation yielded values slightly higher but not significantly different from the in vivo clearance. Hence, the recombinant system correctly predicted selegiline to be a high clearance drug. It was concluded that the recombinant system was of good value for determination of the enzyme specificity but not for in vivo clearance of drug candidates. The role of the hydrophobic NH 2 -terminal of rat CYP 2 E 1 for mitochondrial targeting and membrane interactions was studied by expressing NH 2 -terminally truncated variants of this enzyme in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Six variants were expressed along with the wt CYP 2 E 1, four were truncated at position 29, 64, 82 or 95 (delta 95 - 2 E 1), respectively and one variant had Leu to Asp amino acid exchanges at positions 90 and 91 (delta 82 mut- 2 E 1). With the exception of delta 95 - 2 E 1 and delta 82 mut- 2 E 1, all variants were active in NADPH supported chlorzoxazone 6 -hydroxylation, but when the artificial electron donor cumene hydroperoxide was used, also these were active. A region between as 82 and 95 was found to be critical for mitochondrial import of CYP 2 E 1. It was found that delta 82 mut- 2 E 1 was soluble and catalytically active in phosphate buffer and could be used for crystallization studies. It is concluded that the B-helix of CYP 2 E 1 and possibly other CYPs is important for mitochondrial targeting as well as for membrane association where interactions of ionic nature occur...|$|E
