In the absence of domestic laws regulating the matter, Italian courts have been directly applying so far international customary law, making recourse to a progressive interpretation of international rules. In the past, Italian judicial practice together with the Belgian one gave a great contribution to the consolidation of the restrictive immunity theory. In the last few years, Italian courts have lifted immunity with respect to acts of a foreign State qualified as <b>acta</b> <b>iure</b> <b>imperii</b> in civil proceedings promoted by individuals who were victims of serious violations of humanitarian law and of fundamental human rights. According to Italian judges, the peremptory character of rules prohibiting such conducts would be impaired, and the right to compensation denied, should the violation remain unsanctioned because of the barrier of State immunity. 	I argue in this article that the Italian judicial practice is not inconsistent with existing international law. I examine the relevant provisions of the codification Conventions on State immunity, namely the Basle Convention and the New York Convention, and internal and international case law concerning the relationship between international crimes and rules on State immunity, especially the decisions of the European Court on Human Rights. In the same perspective, I also consider the work of the Institut de Droit international, and the Resolution adopted in 2009 on International crimes and Immunities. In the light of the foregoing analysis, I conclude that the Italian judicial practice restricting the traditional immunity that foreign States enjoy with respect to <b>acta</b> <b>iure</b> <b>imperii</b> in order not to deprive victims of human rights violations amounting to international crimes of the right to pecuniary compensation fits comfortably with recent developments which have occurred in international law concerning the protection of fundamental human rights. I also assert that Italian judges’ decisions foster in that regard the consolidation of a trend that has recently emerged in international practice, at the same time giving a meaningful contribution to the clarification of some controversial issues of the new boundaries of State immunity that the New York Convention leaves unprejudiced...|$|E

It will argue that under certain circumstances domestic courts should not automatically accept that the UN has absolute immunity with regard to all damages that are caused by UN Peacekeeping Forces. Instead courts should draw a careful balance between the interest of upholding UN’s absolute immunity and the interest of guaranteeing due process rights to individuals adversely affected by UN’s actions. The aim of this article is to provide an analysis that may assist in striking such balance. To that end, it will explore the rationale underlying the immunity of international organizations, and it will examine relevant case law of the European Court of Human Rights and several domestic courts. Some of the cases considered concern the issue of targeted sanctions, in which a similar conflict emerges between two opposing international obligations. In addition, the present article will draw a parallel with the distinction used in the field of State immunity between <b>iure</b> <b>imperii</b> and <b>iure</b> gestionis...|$|R
