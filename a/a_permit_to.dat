5|$|Although casinos are {{not under}} the {{jurisdiction}} of the ABC, many of the regulations for casinos and casino vendors are similar to those for ABC class C retailer licensees. Casinos may generally only purchase alcoholic beverages from licensed wholesalers (i.e. ABC Class B licensees). A casino may have a brewpub on site, but production is limited to 3,000 barrels of beer per year, and the beer may only be distributed in open containers on casino floor and in hotel areas of the casino. Casinos may obtain <b>a</b> <b>permit</b> <b>to</b> have tastings, and tasting dinners. Non-profit organizations may obtain <b>a</b> <b>permit</b> <b>to</b> have a social event at a casino where they charge for alcoholic beverages. Organizations are limited to 12 casino social event permits per year, and a given casino may only host 25 such events per year.|$|E

Portland Science Advocates was established as a nonprofit organization, and members hoped to continue the demonstration's mission after the march.|$|E
5|$|Stafford Meadow Brook {{has very}} high water quality as far {{downstream}} {{as the old}} Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad corridor. The stream has received little impact from development above the Williams Bridge Reservoir. However, its banks are affected by urban debris such as yard waste {{in some parts of}} its lower reaches.

5|$|In 2000, the Indonesian {{government}} announced the aviation deregulation policy, {{which makes it}} easier to acquire <b>a</b> <b>permit</b> <b>to</b> establish a new airline company. The policy was meant to stimulate air transportation investments and increase air-travel business in the country, as well as to serve and stimulate tourism industry in the region. As a result, many new airlines began to spring up in Indonesia, among them Lion Air (est. 1999), Sriwijaya Air (est. 2003), Adam Air (operating from 2002 to 2008), and Batavia Air (operating from 2002 to 2013). The deregulation also spurred the low-cost carrier service in Indonesia. Previously, air travel service was dominated by well-established airlines such as Garuda Indonesia and Merpati.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1970s, studies {{indicated}} that active treatment {{would be the}} most suitable remedy for abandoned mine drainage in the watershed of Nanticoke Creek, with hydrated lime being proposed as one possible treatment method. However, some small scale passive treatment has been attempted in the watershed. A 2008 paper estimated that the Nanticoke Creek Assessment and Restoration Project would cost $5,000,000. An active treatment project by the Earth Conservancy began in 2012, with the intent to repair damage caused by the Askam Borehole. The Bureau of Abandoned Mine Reclamation of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has <b>a</b> <b>permit</b> <b>to</b> discharge stormwater into the creek during earth-moving activities involving filling in dangerous strip pits.|$|E
5|$|Officials {{proposed}} dockless bike sharing for the Citi Bike network, {{which would}} allow bikes to be rented without being tethered to docks. This was proposed after several bike sharing companies announced their intent to operate in New York City. In early August, the dockless bike-sharing company Spin had started a dockless operation in the Rockaways, but {{had been told to}} cease and desist operations by the NYCDOT, which had licensed Citi Bike as the only official bike-share operator in New York City. By the end of the month, Citi Bike started designing a dockless prototype that could still lock its own wheels based on whether the customer had paid. Meanwhile, Spin—a viable competitor to Citi Bike with lower per-half-hour pricing—was still looking to get <b>a</b> <b>permit</b> <b>to</b> start operations in New York City.|$|E
5|$|Since 2008, the zoo {{has been}} {{lobbying}} for <b>a</b> <b>permit</b> <b>to</b> build an eagle sanctuary {{in order to}} be able to distribute the animals' feathers to tribal members for ceremonial purposes in accordance with federal law. Since the species are listed as endangered, any remains of dead animals are confiscated by the federal government and transported to a central repository in Colorado; members of Native American Indian nations then have to apply individually to receive parts, such as feathers, in a lengthy process with wait-times that can exceed several years. Since a tribally operated eagle sanctuary constitutes an exception to the process, it would be instrumental in strengthening Navajo cultural sovereignty; currently, only the Iowa and Zuni nations operate eagle sanctuaries for this purpose.|$|E

5|$|The Israeli {{construction}} of the West Bank barrier has affected Bethlehem politically, socially, and economically. The barrier is located along the northern side of the town's built-up area, within m of houses in 'Aida refugee camp on one side, and the Jerusalem municipality on the other. Most entrances and exits from the Bethlehem agglomeration {{to the rest of}} the West Bank are currently subjected to Israeli checkpoints and roadblocks. The level of access varies based on Israeli security directives. Travel for Bethlehem's Palestinian residents from the West Bank into Jerusalem is regulated by a permit-system. Palestinians require <b>a</b> <b>permit</b> <b>to</b> enter the Jewish holy site of Rachel's Tomb. Israeli citizens are barred from entering Bethlehem and the nearby biblical Solomon's Pools.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{evidence}} of sewage contamination, including sewer odors and debris, in the lower reaches of Nanticoke Creek. The city of Nanticoke has <b>a</b> <b>permit</b> <b>to</b> discharge sewage into the creek. Four combined sewer overflows {{are present in the}} watershed. Orange sediment is deposited on the creek's streambed, indicating a high concentration of iron in the waters. Yellow boy is also present along the creek in some places and can be seen from South Cross Valley Expressway. The concentration of total dissolved solids in the creek is 622 milligrams per liter, higher than the United States Environmental Protection Agency criterion for suitability for aquatic life.|$|E
5|$|Ashton Court {{dates back}} to before the 11th century. It is {{believed}} that a fortified manor stood on the site, given to Geoffrey de Montbray, Bishop of Coutances, by William the Conqueror. In the Domesday Book it {{is referred to as}} a wealthy estate owned by the Bishop of Countances, with a manor house, a great hall, and courtyards entered through gatehouses. The property passed through successive owners {{and at the end of}} the 14th century it was considerably expanded when Thomas De Lions, a nobleman originally from France, obtained <b>a</b> <b>permit</b> <b>to</b> enclose a park for his manor. The house was owned by the Choke family for some time. In 1506 it was sold to Sir Giles Daubeney, a knight and a Chamberlain of Henry VII. Henry VIII gave the estate to Sir Thomas Arundel in 1541 and four years later in 1545 Sir Thomas sold it to John Smyth. The Smyth family owned the property for the next 400 years. Smyth also bought the land which had been owned, until the Dissolution of the Monasteries, by Bath Abbey. He used the land to extend the deer park, bringing him into conflict with the residents of Whitchurch, who complained that he had used common land.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, {{the staff}} of The Political Cesspool {{organized}} a rally at the Tennessee area known as Confederate Park, which, along with two other Confederacy-themed parks in downtown Memphis, {{has been the subject}} of a longtime controversy for honoring Confederate soldiers and ideals. The park had been criticized earlier by a black Shelby County official, which attracted the notice of New York-based activist Al Sharpton, who was invited by the Reverend LaSimba Gray to hold a demonstration in Memphis. Sharpton planned a march called the Rally for Dignity from downtown Memphis to another park honoring Confederate Lieutenant General Nathan Bedford Forrest who was involved early in the organization of the Ku Klux Klan. Sharpton canceled the march after Edwards and The Political Cesspool staff obtained <b>a</b> <b>permit</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate in Confederate Park, located along Sharpton's planned march route.|$|E
5|$|In June 2012, Sea World {{applied for}} <b>a</b> <b>permit</b> <b>to</b> {{demolish}} the Bermuda Triangle water ride {{system and the}} interior of its show building. The Bermuda Triangle had been sitting dormant since its closure in October 2010 and had been earmarked by the park as a site for a future attraction. On 12 July 2012, Christian von Elverfeldt from Mack Rides revealed Australia would be receiving a water roller coaster in 2013; leading to speculation that Sea World might have revived its plans. Further development application filings, and reports by the Roller Coaster DataBase and the Gold Coast Bulletin, confirmed this speculation. In September 2012, Sea World asked Austrian firm Dynamic Motion Rides (DyMoRides) to develop a theming and show design concept for the yet-to-be-announced Storm Coaster. DyMoRides was ultimately contracted for the full turnkey project in April 2013. DyMoRides subsequently contracted PEL Creative for creative direction, Full-On Lighting for lighting design, Volume One for audio and visual effects, and Sculpt Studios for theming design.|$|E
5|$|In late 2006, the Jamul Indian tribe {{prepared}} {{to construct a}} casino, but many expressed concerns {{about the amount of}} traffic that would now travel on SR 94. In 2007, Caltrans declared that the construction required <b>a</b> <b>permit</b> <b>to</b> connect to SR94 and to construct on the state right-of-way. At the end of the year, the tribe had started construction on the driveway to the casino, while Caltrans stated that it lacked the information needed to determine if the proposed traffic signal should be approved. In late 2009, the tribe filed a lawsuit against Caltrans over the inability to get approval to connect the driveway with the highway. The tribe made the claim that they were a sovereign nation and did not need the approval, but this was rejected by the court. Caltrans and the tribe came to an agreement in 2009, where the tribe would provide its own studies and pay for environmental mitigation.|$|E
