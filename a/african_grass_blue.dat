40|$|Clearing {{of natural}} {{vegetation}} for pastures and the deliberate introduction of <b>African</b> <b>grasses</b> constitute significant {{threats to the}} biological diversity of the tropics, subtropics, and warm temperate regions of the Americas. <b>African</b> <b>grasses</b> have escaped from cultivated pastures and revegetated rangeland sites and invaded natural areas at alarming rates. Invaded ecosystems tend to be biotically impoverished and differ markedly from adjacent non-invaded areas in structure and function. Effects of pasture creation and invasion by <b>African</b> <b>grasses</b> on ecosystem processes (transformation and flux of energy and matter) are primarily related to loss of woody species {{and changes in the}} fire regime. However, the ecophysiological attributes of the <b>African</b> <b>grasses</b> (e. g. high biomass allocation to leaves, high growth rate, and high leaf-level gas exchange rates) also have important consequences. Here we describe the extent of pasture creation with <b>African</b> <b>grasses</b> and their invasive spread in the New World and review ecological effects of these land-cover changes. We highlight a number of comparative ecophysiological studies within the context of mechanisms responsible for invasion by <b>African</b> <b>grasses</b> and resulting ecosystem change...|$|R
