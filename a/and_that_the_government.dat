5|$|In the report, Hamilton {{felt that}} the {{securities}} should be paid at full value to their legitimate owners, including those who took the financial risk of buying government bonds that most experts thought would never be redeemed. He argued that liberty and property security were inseparable <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> should honor the contracts, as they {{formed the basis of}} public and private morality. To Hamilton, the proper handling of the government debt would also allow America to borrow at affordable interest rates and would also be a stimulant to the economy.|$|E
5|$|Key {{says that}} he {{believes}} {{that global warming is}} a real phenomenon, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> needs to implement measures to reduce human contribution to global warming. Key has committed the National Party to working towards reducing greenhouse emissions in New Zealand by 50% within the next fifty years. Commentators note that as recently as 2005, Key made statements indicating that he was sceptical of the effects and impact of climate change.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia Airlines {{issued a}} media {{statement}} at 07:24 MYT, one {{hour after the}} scheduled arrival time of the flight at Beijing, stating that contact with the flight had been lost by Malaysian ATC at 02:40 <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> had initiated search-and-rescue operations; the time when contact was lost was later corrected to 01:21. Neither the crew nor the aircraft's communication systems relayed a distress signal, indications of bad weather, or technical problems before the aircraft vanished from radar screens.|$|E
50|$|As the {{election}} drew nearer, greater government activity and social spending was observed; infrastructure was built or improved and recruitment {{to the civil}} service was increased. Speaking on TVT on 30 December 2009, Pascal Bodjona, the Minister of State for Territorial Administration, said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> was merely doing {{what was best for}} <b>the</b> people <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government's</b> work was unrelated to {{the election}}.|$|R
25|$|During 2015, {{unemployment}} {{fell from}} 10.1% to 8.8%, while the economy grew by an estimated 6.7%. In November 2015, {{it was reported}} that exchequer receipts were €3 Billion ahead of target <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government's</b> tax revenues had risen by 10.5% throughout 2015. During 2015, Fine Gael rose in the opinion polls, while their coalition partner Labour struggled to rise above 10%.|$|R
50|$|A {{presidential decree}} was {{declared}} in 1995 which provided {{equal rights for}} women <b>and</b> promised <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> would cease sexism against women.|$|R
5|$|Modi also relaxed or {{abolished}} {{a number}} of other environmental regulations, particularly those related to industrial activity. A government committee stated that the existing system only served to create corruption, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> should instead rely on the owners of industries to voluntarily inform the government about the pollution they were creating. Other changes included reducing ministry oversight on small mining projects, and no longer requiring approval from tribal councils for projects inside forested areas. In addition, Modi lifted a moratorium on new industrial activity in the most polluted areas in the countries. The changes were welcomed by businesspeople, but criticised by environmentalists.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution {{provides}} {{that life is}} a right <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> will protect the lives of its citizens against other citizens who wish to harm them or their property. The Constitution also allows {{for the death penalty}} to be exercised for grave crimes, but only in accordance with national law. If citizens are arrested, they are granted due process of law and do not have to testify against themselves or their family members. Citizens are also given the right to vote, housing, compensation for their share of work, and have the ability to move wherever they wish inside Belarus, and have the right to protest against the government.|$|E
5|$|In 1923 Greenfield moved Reid {{out of both}} of his {{portfolios}} {{and made}} him Provincial Treasurer, where he perpetuated his fiscal conservatism across the government. Early in his tenure, he presented a brief to cabinet recommending that ministers reduce their budgets <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> create a purchasing department tasked with coordinating spending on supplies. In these proposals he found a close ally in Brownlee, Greenfield's Attorney-General, and when Brownlee succeeded Greenfield as Premier in 1925 he kept Reid as Provincial Treasurer and re-appointed him as Minister of Municipal Affairs. Brownlee and Reid {{had a history of}} working closely not only on fiscal issues, but also on agricultural ones: in July 1923, they had travelled together to investigate the creation of a wheat pool in Alberta. This trip included a meeting with cooperative pioneer Aaron Sapiro in San Francisco and a visit to Chicago's commodity market. Both Reid and Brownlee concluded that a pool ought to be proceeded with cautiously, if at all, though this view was overruled when a later visit by Sapiro to Alberta generated sufficient enthusiasm that the government {{had little choice but to}} go along with the creation of the Alberta Wheat Pool.|$|E
40|$|Whilst {{weighing}} up his options for next week’s Budget, the Chancellor {{will be coming}} under significant industry pressure to cut alcohol duty, as he has {{for the past three}} years. One common argument is that UK consumers are overburdened with alcohol taxes. However, Aveek Bhattacharya presents analysis showing that alcohol taxes should in fact be significantly higher – <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government’s</b> own estimates of social harm lead to the same conclusion...|$|R

50|$|He was {{a critic}} of <b>the</b> <b>Government's</b> policy in Palestine when the British mandate was surrendered, arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{withdrawal}} of British troops had been mishandled <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government's</b> orders had favoured Jews over Arabs. On 30 November Gomme-Duncan presented a petition signed by 530,000 housewives who called on <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> to provide a fuller ration of fresh and varied meat, and {{a larger share of}} unrationed meat. In addition to serious points, however, Gomme-Duncan became known for making humorous remarks in Parliament, frequently provoking laughter.|$|R
5|$|On 11 May 2010 the FIFA Emergency Committee {{suspended}} the Salvadoran Football Federation (FESFUT) {{on account of}} government interference. This decision by FIFA {{was based on the}} fact that the statutes ratified by the FESFUT general assembly in August 2009 had not been formally entered in the country's official register, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> had failed to acknowledge the authority of the Normalisation Committee set up to represent FESFUT. Consequently, FIFA considered that it was not possible for FESFUT to organise the general assembly in line with the action plan that had been drawn up, and suspended FESFUT. For the suspension to be lifted, Salvadoran authorities needed to recognize the legitimacy of the Normalisation Committee of the Salvadoran Football Association. The suspension was lifted by May 28. By FIFA lifting the suspension, La Selecta was once again allowed to participate in international tournaments at both club and national levels. El Salvador's under-21 team qualified for the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games (CAC) tournament in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico. However, CONCACAF decided to suspend football at the 2010 CAC shortly thereafter. El Salvador was also able to participate in the qualifying tournament for the 2012 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The agents find Banton at {{the train}} station, but he runs to a poorly lit area. He {{declares}} that walking into his shadow will kill the agents, so Mulder shoots out the overhead lights. Banton allows himself {{to be taken to}} a mental hospital, where he is put in a room with soft light per his own request. He tells the agents that the accident in his lab caused his shadow to behave like a black hole, splitting atoms into component particles and reducing matter into pure energy. Banton claims that the deaths were all accidents, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> wants to exploit him. Detective Ryan and her superior officer stop the questioning, declaring the case closed, despite Mulder's objections. Mulder contacts X (Steven Williams), who assures him that the government has no interest in Banton. However, X and two associates later attempt to remove Banton from the hospital by cutting the power. In the process, the two attendants are killed when the emergency lights turn on and Banton's shadow falls upon them. Banton flees from the hospital.|$|E
5|$|The next day, troops {{pulled back}} away from Tikrit to {{the nearby town of}} Dijla, south of the city, in an attempt to regroup after meeting stiff resistance. Fighting also {{continued}} near the university and around the air base, which had reportedly come under army control. During the day's battles, another Iraqi army helicopter was shot down over the city and crashed near a market, while the army sent tanks to join the fighting at the university. An Iraqi army spokesman claimed 70militants had been killed in Tikrit in the previous 24 hours <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> forces were in control of the university. Neither of the claims were independently confirmed. Later, fierce clashes were reported in an area about 20 kilometers from the city center, toward Samarra. Militants reportedly made an advance but were stopped about 10 kilometers south of Tikrit. That same day, ISIL declared itself a worldwide caliphate.|$|E

50|$|Civil {{society and}} certain media outlets {{also took a}} similar stance against <b>the</b> bills, <b>and</b> claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government's</b> {{reasoning}} for these bills conceals an intent to pardon convicted politicians and cease ongoing cases against accused politicians.|$|R
5|$|The {{resistance}} came to {{a climax}} in 1794. In May of that year, federal district attorney William Rawle issued subpoenas for more than 60 distillers in Pennsylvania who had not paid the excise tax. Under the law then in effect, distillers who received these writs would be obligated to travel to Philadelphia to appear in federal court. For farmers on the western frontier, such a journey was expensive, time-consuming, and beyond their means. At the urging of William Findley, Congress modified this law on June 5, 1794, allowing excise trials {{to be held in}} local state courts. But by that time, U.S. marshal David Lenox had already been sent to serve the writs summoning delinquent distillers to Philadelphia. Attorney General William Bradford later maintained that the writs were meant to compel compliance with the law, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> did not actually intend to hold trials in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|Given that Moreno González's {{body was}} never {{recovered}} from the December 2010 shootout where officials said he was killed, there were rumors that he was alive and secretly leading the Knights Templar Cartel, the split-off group of La Familia Michoacana. On June 2011, members of La Familia Michoacana set up several public banners throughout the state of Guerrero with written messages directed to the former President Calderón and his security spokesman Alejandro Poiré. The banners proclaimed that Moreno González was in fact alive and leading the Knights Templar Cartel, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> was allegedly covering him up. The rumors were immediately denied by the Mexican government, which stood firm that the drug lord was killed by federal forces on December 9, 2010. Rumors sparked again in October 2011 following the arrest of Mario Buenrostro Quiroz, a drug trafficker who headed a Mexico City-based gang known as Los Aboytes. In a videotaped police confession, he told authorities that Moreno González was still alive and heading the cartel. Intelligence agency InSight Crime said the rumors were probably part of a campaign of the Knights Templar Cartel to win prestige from La Familia Michoacana by saying that their leader is in fact alive and still supporting the group. On 27 October 2012, the Mexican Army raided a safe house in Apatzingán where they believed the drug lord Enrique Plancarte Solís was hiding. Though the raid was ultimately unsuccessful because Plancarte Solís managed to avoid capture by sending several gunmen from his inner circle to battle off the soldiers, the authorities discovered several documents written for Moreno González. The Army gave the documents to the intelligence agency SIEDO for further investigation.|$|E
