5|$|Abelson's studies {{indicated}} {{that in order}} to reduce the equilibrium time, he needed to have a much greater temperature gradient. The NRL considered building it at the Naval Engineering Experiment Station in Annapolis, Maryland, but this was estimated to cost $2.5 million, which the NRL regarded as too expensive. Other sites were canvassed, and it was decided to build a new pilot plant at the Naval Boiler and Turbine Laboratory (NBTL) at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, where there was space, steam and cooling water, <b>and,</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> important of all, engineers with experience with high-pressure steam. The cost was estimated at $500,000. The pilot plant was authorized by Rear Admiral Earle W. Mills, the Assistant Chief of the Bureau of Ships on 17 November 1943. Construction commenced on 1 January 1944, and was completed in July. The NBTL was responsible for the design, construction and operation of the steam and cooling water systems, while the NRL dealt with the columns and subsidiary equipment. Captain Thorvald A. Solberg from the Bureau of Ships was project officer.|$|E
5|$|The Flavian {{approach}} to government {{was one of}} both implicit and explicit exclusion. When Vespasian returned to Rome in mid-70, he immediately embarked {{on a series of}} efforts to consolidate his power and prevent future revolts. He offered gifts to the military and dismissed or punished those soldiers loyal to Vitellius. He also restructured the Senatorial and Equestrian orders, removing his enemies and adding his allies. Executive control was largely distributed among members of his family. Non-Flavians were virtually excluded from important public offices, even those who had been among Vespasian's earliest supporters during the civil war. Mucianus slowly disappears from the historical records during this time, and it is believed he died sometime between 75 and 77. That it was Vespasian's intention to found a long-lasting dynasty to govern the Roman Empire was most evident in the powers he conferred upon his eldest son Titus. Titus shared tribunician power with his father, received seven consulships, the censorship, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> remarkably, was given command of the Praetorian Guard. Because Titus effectively acted as co-emperor with his father, no abrupt change in Flavian policy occurred during his brief reign from 79 until 81.|$|E

25|$|After a slow start, {{the firm}} had its first major success with Mary Elizabeth Braddon's first novel Lady Audley's Secret in 1862.

25|$|Another was the {{addition}} of several highlights and outlines consistent with matching the effects of chromatic aberration, particularly noticeable in primitive optics. Last, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> telling, is a noticeable curvature in the original painting's rendition of the scrollwork on the harpsichord. This effect matched Jenison's technique precisely, caused by exactly duplicating the view as seen from a curved mirror.|$|E
25|$|The {{conflict}} with the Wiradjuri people lessened by the 1850s, as gold mining and free selection brought new settlers to the area. The unrelenting tide of Europeans overwhelmed the indigenous population, resulting in the occupation of traditional lands, the destruction of sacred sites, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> damaging of all, {{the introduction of new}} diseases. This eventually led to the displacement and the decline of the Wiradjuri people.|$|E

25|$|A further {{difficulty}} is {{presented by the}} shortage of trained health-care workers for tuberculosis control. CDC facilities are being rebuilt across the country but many are staffed inadequately or by poorly trained and unmotivated health-care workers.

25|$|His {{work was}} complex, extensive, and deeply thought out, {{at least until}} late in his life, when he benefited less often from {{critical}} feedback of research peers, reviewers of proposals and reports to government bodies in the US and UK, <b>and,</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> especially, the tension between experimentation and theoretical stands. His publications, however, represent a storehouse of ideas that are not fully mined.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the terms}} of the treaty, Syracuse would become a Roman ally, pay a {{somewhat}} light indemnity of 100 talents of silver to Rome <b>and,</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> importantly, agree to help supply the Roman army in Sicily. That solved the Roman problem of having to keep an overseas army provisioned while facing an enemy with a superior navy. Following the defection of Syracuse from Carthage, several other smaller Carthaginian dependencies in Sicily also switched to the Roman side.|$|E
25|$|As well as {{recreational}} drug use, Welsh's fiction and non-fiction {{is dominated by}} the question of working class and Scottish identity in the period spanning the 1960s to the present day.
