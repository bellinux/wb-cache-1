Many rice varieties {{have been selected}} for resistance to insect pests. Therefore, particular cultivars are recommended for areas prone to certain pest problems. The genetically based ability of a rice variety to withstand pest attacks is called resistance. Three main types of plant resistance to pests are recognized as nonpreference, antibiosis, and tolerance. Nonpreference (or antixenosis) describes host plants which insects prefer to avoid; antibiosis is where insect survival is reduced after the ingestion of host tissue; and tolerance is the capacity of a plant to produce high yield or retain high quality despite insect infestation.|$|E
25|$|The {{classes of}} CYPs most often {{investigated}} in non-human animals are those either involved in development (e.g., retinoic acid or hormone metabolism) or {{involved in the}} metabolism of toxic compounds (such as heterocyclic amines or polyaromatic hydrocarbons). Often there <b>are</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> gene regulation or enzyme function of CYPs in related animals that explain observed differences in susceptibility to toxic compounds (ex. canines inability to metabolize xanthines such as caffeine). Some drugs undergo metabolism in both species via different enzymes, resulting in different metabolites, while other drugs are metabolized in one species but excreted unchanged in another species. For this reason, one species's reaction to a substance is not a reliable indication of the substance's effects in humans.|$|E
