6000|$|... "I {{guess you}} had better let us carry {{you out of the}} woods," [...] said Jack. [...] "You can't walk, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> can't stay here alone." ...|$|E
60|$|CHARTERIS. You {{forget the}} revolt of the daughters, Craven. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> wouldn't {{have gone on}} like that to any grown up woman who was not your daughter.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{no fear of}} that, I think, Ruth. They {{never asked}} you whether you had found anything; <b>and</b> though <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> hid the truth, you did not {{absolutely}} give false evidence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{not like}} you, Katia," [...] Petroff said. [...] "I have heard you say your maxim is 'At any cost,' <b>and</b> <b>you</b> have <b>certainly</b> lived up to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take {{him with}} you by all means; your ensign only {{joined with the}} last draft, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> will <b>certainly</b> want someone with you of greater {{experience}} than he has." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Few {{people have}} been through {{as much as you}} have, Rosa, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> have earned the right to rest,' I said consolingly, for her little whims and vanities amused me much.|$|E
6000|$|... "Racquets {{would help}} you with lawn tennis," [...] she said, [...] "but beyond that I find that not {{a dozen years ago}} you were a scratch golfer, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> won the amateur {{championship}} of Italy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} you have, Julian," [...] Frank said, looking closely at his brother. [...] "The {{expression}} {{of your face}} has very much changed, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> look as if you could say 'No' very decidedly now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, admit for {{the sake}} of {{argument}} that it isn't. My difficulty in regard to reading remains, <b>and</b> there <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> could help me. At moments it seems to me that I have come to the end of my line." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come on, if only {{to please}} me," [...] urged Martin. [...] "You will find Toglet's mother a very nice old lady, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> will <b>certainly</b> believe her, even if you will not believe me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The {{fragments}} of the wretched man,' whispered Beverley. 'They must be swept up <b>and</b> decently interred. <b>You</b> <b>certainly</b> have got the punch, Miss Brougham.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is a puzzle," [...] {{the giant}} responded, thoughtfully. [...] "I {{do not see}} how you could ride on a bicycle {{even if you had}} one, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> can not walk far in your present condition." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} it very probable, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> will be successful. They like American young ladies very much over here; they show them {{a great deal}} of kindness. But you mustn't feel too much at home, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{that you}} say is granted," [...] Seaman agreed. [...] "You met me at Cape Town in your new identity, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> seemed to wear it wonderfully. You have made it uncommonly expensive, {{but we do not}} grudge money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'To {{tell the}} truth, gentlemen,' said he, 'the Baron has a cup {{or two of}} wine in him at this hour, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> would <b>certainly</b> find him a more {{entertaining}} companion {{if you were to}} come again in the morning.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here," [...] {{the officer}} said, [...] "we part. That town which you see {{across the river}} is held by the Swedes, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> will <b>certainly</b> meet with no molestation from any of our side as you ride down to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rather, you are {{not such}} a coward. I must have been terrible yesterday. I--I almost struck <b>you.</b> <b>And</b> <b>you</b> were <b>certainly</b> brave when the whip hung over you. Why, you did not even attempt to raise a hand and shield yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You put strange {{ideas into}} my head," [...] {{he told her}} lightly. [...] "Why should I not play the part that you suggest? It might be amusing, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> deserve all the evil which I could bring upon you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think they}} would," [...] she admitted. [...] "You {{seem to have}} {{cultivated}} quite a jaunty appearance, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> look years younger. One would think that you enjoyed crawling away out of your world into hiding, with a very foolish wicked wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{you have}} found out, you can tell me," [...] Mowbray answered, and gave the boy an {{approving}} smile. [...] "You're quite right in standing by your friend, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> owe Harding something. If you can prove him better than we think, nobody will be more pleased than I." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it--I know it," [...] {{said the}} Marquis; [...] "in a strict heraldic <b>and</b> genealogical sense, <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> are so; what I mean is, that being {{in some measure}} under my guardianship----" ...|$|R
60|$|PRINCE PAUL. You {{ought to}} remember, too, Professor, {{that if you}} were seized, as you {{probably}} would be, <b>and</b> hung, as <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> would be, there would be nobody left to read your own articles.|$|R
5000|$|One of Choate's {{very famous}} quotes was [...] "You cannot live without lawyers, <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>you</b> cannot die without them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Harriet, [...] "I haven't, but I {{know the}} {{symptoms}} <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> haven't {{got one of}} them. Whenever Harold isn't {{going to be up}} for dinner or for the evening you're always relieved. Possibly you don't realize it yourself, but you show it to any one who knows you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You did {{not look}} frightened a bit, Marion; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> gave that fellow a {{tremendous}} scare. Didn't he drop his club sharp? And now, {{what do you think}} we had better do? The first thing is to get the Grimstones in. Those fellows may have been watching for some time and saw them go out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is beastly hot," [...] Hammond said, {{getting up}} and {{stretching}} himself; [...] "but as you are so earnest about it, Gale, perhaps we had better make a move. As you say, you know no end more of these fellows than we do; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> ain't a fellow {{to get into a}} funk about nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must get}} {{accustomed}} to them, my dear, {{so that when}} you find your own people, you will not be stiff <b>and</b> awkward; as <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> will be, when you dress in English fashion for the first time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is rot!" [...] he said. [...] "Willow Dene {{belongs to}} me, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> are <b>certainly</b> not coming in. I don't feel {{inclined}} to explain my reasons for keeping {{you out of}} it, and it's quite probable you wouldn't understand them. Have you brought any responsible person to whom one could talk along with you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will pass}} well, now," [...] Cuitcatl said, heading {{him out in}} the moonlight, so that he could obtain a good view of him. [...] "It is only your height that is against you. Still, some men are taller than others; though I never saw one as tall as <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> will <b>certainly</b> be stared at.|$|R
6000|$|Coulthurst {{glanced at}} him sharply, and his face grew a trifle red. [...] "Ingleby is very young in {{comparison}} with myself, but you were once good enough to allude {{to him as a}} friend of mine, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> met him at my house as my guest. If there was any particular meaning in your speech, {{it would be better to}} come straight to the point. I don't like hints." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then what I said belied my thoughts. It {{seems to}} me, Mr. Wilkinson, since you drive {{me to speak}} out, that the matter {{is very much in}} your own hands. You are {{certainly}} a free agent. You know better than I can tell you what your duty to your mother and sisters requires. Circumstances have made them dependent on you, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> are not the man to disacknowledge the burden." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Croft, [...] "although I can't say you {{are right}} in making your {{relatives}} believe you are married when you are not, still I see you had very fair reasons for what you did, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> showed {{a great deal of}} ingenuity and pluck in carrying out your remarkable schemes. By-the-way," [...] he continued, somewhat hesitatingly, [...] "I am in your debt for your services to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That will do," [...] Monsieur Bonchamp said. [...] "Of {{course you}} are not perfect, yet; but with {{a quarter of an}} hour's drill by your commander, every day, {{at the end of a}} week you will be able to do it quickly <b>and</b> neatly; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> will <b>certainly</b> find it a great advantage, if you come upon the enemy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I had {{not thought}} of it in that way," [...] she answered. [...] "Perhaps I am wrong, your Majesty; <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>you</b> are very beautiful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is true, Amuba, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> have <b>certainly</b> {{hit upon}} the weak {{point in the}} use of such a weapon; but for single combat, or the {{fighting}} of broken ranks, they would be grand. When we get back to Thebes if I can find any peasant who can instruct me {{in the use of}} these neboots I will certainly learn it." ...|$|R
