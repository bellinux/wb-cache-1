25|$|Phosgene can be {{released}} during building fires. In one instance, a deputy fire chief was killed {{ten days after}} inhaling fumes that wafted down outside a burning restaurant. After a two-day hospitalization he had appeared to recover, but ultimately suffered cardiac arrest at home following tracheobronchial inflammation, alveolar hemorrhage, and pulmonary edema. The phosgene was produced by decomposing Freon-22 after flames ducted up from a grease fire heated an <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>unit</b> {{on the roof and}} ruptured a hose.|$|E
25|$|Lorenzo instituted {{cost-cutting}} measures at Eastern by outsourcing some maintenance work, requiring {{pilots to}} fly longer hours, and delaying repairs. In one instance, a pilot refused to fly {{with only one}} functioning <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>unit</b> on a cross-country flight. The FAA investigated {{in the summer of}} 1987 and found that Eastern had the worst repair record of 11 airlines, and had an average of 55 items unrepaired per day, compared to an average of 29 in the industry. In October 1987, at a Congressional hearing, pilots told of being forced to fly unsafe planes.|$|E
500|$|The Carrier Engineering Corporation {{installed}} an {{air-conditioning system}} that promised a [...] constant temperature at 56 percent relative humidity. Some smaller single story buildings such as stores, auditoriums, and theaters had been air-conditioned earlier, but a high-rise multi-story office building required unique {{technology in the}} original construction to allow for controlled air-handling through a delivery system of ducts throughout the building. The Milam building's air-conditioning and cooling system consisted of 11 units of air-conditioning equipment, including fans, dehumidifiers, heaters. There were two refrigeration units with a maximum 375-ton capacity for cooling water, in addition to water storage tanks, pumps, and piping. The distribution lines consisted of air-distribution ducts with grills and dampers. There were manual and automatic power systems that controlled the air-flow. One <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>unit</b> served two floors, with a few exceptions. The majority of the equipment was located {{in the basement of}} the building.|$|E
25|$|The Boston cars' <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>units</b> were {{originally}} mounted under the car, and constantly sucked in dirt and debris {{from under the}} car. The MBTA later modified 76 LRVs with roof-mounted <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>units</b> to address this.|$|R

500|$|A notable {{feature of}} the Final Destination films is the {{threshold}} or tipping-point logic of characters' deaths. Conrich frames the complex death sequences in Final Destination films as [...] "death games, contraptions or puzzles {{in which there are}} only losers", which he compares to Rube Goldberg machines, the Grand Guignol, and Mouse Trap. Brinkema picks out the deaths of Ashley and Ashlyn from Final Destination 3 as epitomizing the death sequences in the Final Destination series. The characters' deaths are brought about by [...] "a series of neutral gestures, a set of constraints that will ultimately lead to their conflagratory ends"; these include the placing of a drink, a rifling-through of CDs, and an ill-chosen doorstop. The scene utilizes logics of temperature, color, and light to realize the deaths of the characters, as well as to allow Wendy to recognize the threat that they face. The [...] "literal tipping point", at which the characters can no longer escape, occurs when a coat rack is knocked onto the sunbeds; it is blown by an <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>unit,</b> which was turned on by the rising heat. Conrich identifies the roller-coaster derailment as paradigmatic of the franchise's focus on mobility in death sequences. He argues that theme-park rides and horror cinema are mutually influential; the former draw from the frightening aspects of the latter, while the latter draw from the [...] "theatrics and kinetics" [...] of the former.|$|E
500|$|Other bands {{used more}} direct lyrics, and faced {{censorship}} and harassment as a result. Savuka, a multi-racial band, were often arrested or had their concerts raided for playing their song [...] "Asimbonanga", which {{was dedicated to}} Biko, Mandela, and others associated with the anti-apartheid movement. A musical tour by Voëlvry musicians faced significant opposition from the government. Major surveillance and threats from police sparked trouble {{at the beginning of}} the tour, which created issues over suitable venues, and the musicians were forced to play in abandoned buildings. After Roger Lucey wrote a song critical of the secret police, he received threatening visits by them late at night, and had tear gas poured into an <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>unit</b> during one of his concerts. Lucey's producers were intimidated by the security forces, and his musical recordings confiscated: Lucey himself abandoned his musical career. The song was banned, and an individual could be jailed for five years for owning a copy of it. Musician and public speaker Mzwakhe Mbuli faced more violent reactions: he was shot at, and a grenade was thrown at his house. After the release of his first album [...] "Change is Pain" [...] in 1986, he was arrested and tortured: the album was banned. The concerts of Juluka were sometimes broken up by the police, and musicians were often arrested under the [...] "pass laws" [...] of the apartheid government. When they were stopped, black musicians were often asked to play for the police, to prove that they were in fact musicians.|$|E
