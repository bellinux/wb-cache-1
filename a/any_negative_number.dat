40|$|We study a {{boundary}} value problem related to the search of standing waves for the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLS) on graphs. Precisely {{we are interested in}} characterizing the standing waves of NLS posed on the double-bridge graph, in which two semi-infinite half-lines are attached at a circle at different vertices. At the two vertices the so-called Kirchhoff boundary conditions are imposed. The configuration of the graph is characterized by two lengths, L_ 1 and L_ 2, and we are interested in the existence and properties of standing waves of given frequency ω. For every ω> 0 only solutions supported on the circle exist (cnoidal solutions), and only for a rational value of L_ 1 /L_ 2; they can be extended to every ω∈R. We study, for ω< 0, the solutions periodic on the circle but with nontrivial components on the half-lines. The problem turns out to be equivalent to a nonlinear {{boundary value problem}} in which the boundary condition depends on the spectral parameter ω. After classifying the solutions with rational L_ 1 /L_ 2, we turn to L_ 1 /L_ 2 irrational showing that there exist standing waves only in correspondence to a countable set of frequencies ω_n. Moreover we show that the frequency sequence {ω_n}_n ≥ 1 has a cluster point at -∞ and it admits at least a finite limit point, in general non-zero. Finally, <b>any</b> <b>negative</b> real <b>number</b> can be a limit point of a set of admitted frequencies up to the choice of a suitable irrational geometry L_ 1 /L_ 2 for the graph.
