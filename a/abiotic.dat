5|$|A {{series of}} biotic and <b>abiotic</b> cues, such as {{individual}} genetics, foraging quantity and quality, or population density, may trigger the maturation of the reproductive organs {{and the production}} of gametes and thus determine sexual maturity. Like many reptiles, all marine turtles of a same aggregation are highly unlikely to reach sexual maturity at the same size and thus age.|$|E
5|$|Ecosystems are {{composed}} {{of a variety of}} <b>abiotic</b> and biotic components that function in an interrelated way. The structure and composition is determined by various environmental factors that are interrelated. Variations of these factors will initiate dynamic modifications to the ecosystem. Some of the more important components are: soil, atmosphere, radiation from the sun, water, and living organisms.|$|E
5|$|A model {{suggests}} that Enceladus's salty ocean (-Na, -Cl, -CO3) has an alkaline pH of 11 to 12. The high pH is interpreted to be {{a consequence of}} serpentinization of chondritic rock {{that leads to the}} generation of H2, a geochemical source of energy that can support both <b>abiotic</b> and biological synthesis of organic molecules such as those that have been detected in Enceladus's plumes.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{depend on}} certain edaphic (soil) and climatic factors in their {{environment}} but can modify these factors too. For example, they can change their environment's albedo, increase runoff interception, stabilise mineral soils and develop their organic content, and affect local temperature. Plants compete with other organisms in their ecosystem for resources. They interact with their neighbours {{at a variety of}} spatial scales in groups, populations and communities that collectively constitute vegetation. Regions with characteristic vegetation types and dominant plants as well as similar <b>abiotic</b> and biotic factors, climate, and geography make up biomes like tundra or tropical rainforest.|$|E
5|$|Ecology is {{the study}} of the {{distribution}} and abundance of living organisms, the interaction between them and their environment. An organism shares an environment that includes other organisms and biotic factors as well as local <b>abiotic</b> factors (non-living) such as climate and ecology. One reason that biological systems can be difficult to study is that so many different interactions with other organisms and the environment are possible, even on small scales. A microscopic bacterium responding to a local sugar gradient is responding to its environment as much as a lion searching for food in the African savanna. For any species, behaviors can be co-operative, competitive, parasitic, or symbiotic. Matters become more complex when two or more species interact in an ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|Variation exists within all {{populations of}} organisms. This occurs partly because random {{mutations}} {{arise in the}} genome of an individual organism, and offspring can inherit such mutations. Throughout {{the lives of the}} individuals, their genomes interact with their environments to cause variations in traits. The environment of a genome includes the molecular biology in the cell, other cells, other individuals, populations, species, as well as the <b>abiotic</b> environment. Individuals with certain variants of the trait may survive and reproduce more than individuals with other, less successful, variants; therefore, the population evolves. Factors that affect reproductive success are also important, including sexual selection (now often included in natural selection) and fecundity selection.|$|E
5|$|Ecology and {{evolutionary}} biology are considered sister disciplines {{of the life}} sciences. Natural selection, life history, development, adaptation, populations, and inheritance are examples of concepts that thread equally into ecological {{and evolutionary}} theory. Morphological, behavioural, and genetic traits, for example, can be mapped onto evolutionary trees to study {{the historical development of}} a species in relation to their functions and roles in different ecological circumstances. In this framework, the analytical tools of ecologists and evolutionists overlap as they organize, classify, and investigate life through common systematic principals, such as phylogenetics or the Linnaean system of taxonomy. The two disciplines often appear together, such as in the title of the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution. There is no sharp boundary separating ecology from evolution, and they differ more in their areas of applied focus. Both disciplines discover and explain emergent and unique properties and processes operating across different spatial or temporal scales of organization. While the boundary between ecology and evolution is not always clear, ecologists study the <b>abiotic</b> and biotic factors that influence evolutionary processes, and evolution can be rapid, occurring on ecological timescales as short as one generation.|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} and abundance of organisms in the LSZ {{is dependent upon}} both <b>abiotic</b> and biotic factors. <b>Abiotic</b> factors include the physical geography and hydrology of the estuary, including nutrient inputs, sediment load, turbidity, environmental stochasticity, climate and anthropogenic influences. <b>Abiotic</b> factors tend to drive production in the estuarine environment, and are mediated by biotic factors.|$|E

25|$|AM fungi {{have been}} shown to improve plant {{tolerance}} to <b>abiotic</b> environmental factors such as salinity. They alleviate salt stress and benefit plant growth and productivity.|$|E
25|$|In 1991–1992, {{a second}} borehole, Stenberg-1, was drilled {{a few miles}} away to a depth of , finding similar results. Again, no <b>abiotic</b> {{hydrocarbons}} were found.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} routes for {{geological}} methane generation, organic (thermogenic), and inorganic (<b>abiotic,</b> meaning non-living). Thermally generated methane, {{is referred to as}} thermogenic, originating from deeper sedimentary strata. Thermogenic methane (CH4) formation occurs due to the break-up of organic matter, forced by elevated temperatures and pressures. This type of methane is considered to be the primary methane type in sedimentary basins, and from an economical perspective the most important source of natural gas. Thermogenic methane components are generally considered to be relic (from an earlier time). Generally, formation of thermogenic methane (at depth), can occur through organic matter break-up, or organic synthesis, both ways can involve microorganisms (methanogenesis) but may also occur inorganically. The involved anaerobic and aerobic processes can also consume methane, with and without microorganisms.The more important source of methane at depth (crystalline bedrock) is <b>abiotic.</b> <b>Abiotic</b> means that the methane formation took place involving inorganic compounds, without biological activity, magmatic or created at low temperatures and pressures through water-rock reactions.|$|E
25|$|Volcanic eruptions may emit PAHs. Certain PAHs such as perylene {{can also}} be {{generated}} in anaerobic sediments from existing organic material, although it remains undetermined whether <b>abiotic</b> or microbial processes drive their production.|$|E
25|$|The {{ecosystem}} of a {{river is}} the river viewed as a system operating in its natural environment, and includes biotic (living) interactions amongst plants, animals and micro-organisms, as well as <b>abiotic</b> (nonliving) physical and chemical interactions.|$|E
25|$|An {{ecosystem}} (also {{called as}} environment) {{is a natural}} unit consisting of all plants, animals and micro-organisms (biotic factors) in an area functioning together {{with all of the}} non-living physical (<b>abiotic)</b> factors of the environment.|$|E
25|$|Methane {{has been}} {{detected}} or {{is believed to}} exist on all planets {{of the solar system}} and most of the larger moons. With the possible exception of Mars, it is believed to have come from <b>abiotic</b> processes.|$|E
25|$|The {{breeding}} season {{is the most}} suitable season, usually with favorable conditions and abundant food and water for breeding. <b>Abiotic</b> {{factors such as the}} timing of seasonal rains and winds can also {{play an important role in}} breeding onset and success.|$|E
25|$|One goal of cumin {{breeding}} is {{to improve}} its resistance to biotic (fungal diseases) and <b>abiotic</b> (cold, drought, salinity) stresses. The potential genetic variability for conventional breeding of cumin is limited and research about cumin genetics is scarce.|$|E
25|$|Plants {{have limited}} seed {{dispersal}} mobility {{away from their}} parents, consequently relying upon a variety of dispersal vectors to transport their propagules, including both <b>abiotic</b> and biotic vectors. Seeds can be dispersed away from the parent plant individually or collectively.|$|E
25|$|Depending on {{the source}} of pollen, {{pollination}} can be classified into 2 types - Self-pollination and Cross Pollination (Xenogamy). Self Pollination is further divided into Autogamy and Geitonogamy. Depending on agent of Pollination, pollination can be classified into <b>abiotic</b> pollination and biotic pollination.|$|E
25|$|Anthocyanins have an {{antioxidant}} role {{in plants}} against {{reactive oxygen species}} caused by <b>abiotic</b> stresses, such as overexposure to ultraviolet light and extreme temperatures. Tomato plants protect against cold stress with anthocyanins countering reactive oxygen species, leading to a lower rate of cell death in leaves.|$|E
25|$|At altitudes below 3400 meters (12,000 feet)the daily {{temperature}} fluctuations are less extreme, the average daily temperature steadily increases, {{and the growth}} forms and ecology of the Dendroseneico reflect the increased influence of biotic factors (such as competition for light) over <b>abiotic</b> factors (such as nightly frost).|$|E
25|$|Magnetite, {{chromite}} and ilmenite are Fe-spinel group minerals {{found in}} many rocks but rarely as a major component in non-ultramafic rocks. In these rocks, high concentrations of magmatic magnetite, chromite and ilmenite provide a reduced matrix which may allow <b>abiotic</b> cracking of methane to higher hydrocarbons during hydrothermal events.|$|E
25|$|Soil ecology is {{the study}} of the {{interactions}} among soil organisms, and between biotic and <b>abiotic</b> aspects of the soil environment. It is particularly concerned with the cycling of nutrients, formation and stabilization of the pore structure, the spread and vitality of pathogens, and the biodiversity of this rich biological community.|$|E
25|$|DE allows {{control of}} {{selection}} pressure, mutation rate and environment (both the <b>abiotic</b> environment such as temperature, and the biotic environment, such as other {{genes in the}} organism). Additionally, there is a complete record of all evolutionary intermediate genes. This allows for detailed measurements of evolutionary processes, for example epistasis, evolvability, adaptive constraint fitness landscapes, and neutral networks.|$|E
25|$|A {{chemical}} {{basis for}} the <b>abiotic</b> petroleum process is the serpentinization of peridotite, beginning with methanogenesis via hydrolysis of olivine into serpentine {{in the presence of}} carbon dioxide. Olivine, composed of Forsterite and Fayalite metamorphoses into serpentine, magnetite and silica by the following reactions, with silica from fayalite decomposition (reaction 1a) feeding into the forsterite reaction (1b).|$|E
25|$|TNT is a {{reactive}} molecule and {{is particularly}} prone to react with reduced components of sediments or photodegradation {{in the presence}} of sunlight. TNT is thermodynamically and kinetically capable of reacting with a wide number of components of many environmental systems. This includes wholly <b>abiotic</b> reactants, like photons, hydrogen sulfide, Fe2+, or microbial communities, both oxic and anoxic.|$|E
25|$|Like other {{heterogeneous}} catalysts, MOFs {{may allow}} for easier post-reaction separation and recyclability than homogeneous catalysts. In some cases, they also give a highly enhanced catalyst stability. Additionally, they typically offer substrate-size selectivity. Nevertheless, while clearly important for reactions in living systems, selectivity {{on the basis}} of substrate size is of limited value in <b>abiotic</b> catalysis, as reasonably pure feedstocks are generally available.|$|E
25|$|Many other biotic and <b>abiotic</b> {{factors can}} mediate {{competition}} among EcM fungi, such as temperature, soil pH, soil moisture, host specificity, and competitor number. The results of many studies concerning these factors indicate that these interactions are largely environmentally context-dependent. These aspects can {{often lead to}} “checkerboard” distribution patterns, where certain species occupy locations that are mutually exclusive of the other species.|$|E
25|$|Many {{types of}} peppers have been bred for heat, size, and yield. Along with {{selection}} of specific fruit traits such as flavor and color, specific pest, disease and <b>abiotic</b> stress resistances are continually being selected. Breeding occurs in several environments {{dependent on the}} use of the final variety including but not limited to: conventional, organic, hydroponic, green house and shade house production environments.|$|E
25|$|Estimates {{consider}} up to 15,000 gigatonnes {{of carbon}} may {{be stored in}} the form of clathrates (hydrates) in the ocean floor, not accounting for <b>abiotic</b> methane, a relatively newly discovered source of methane, formed below the ocean floor, in the earth crust. It has been suggested, that today's methane emission regime from the ocean floor, is potentially similar to that during the PETM.|$|E
25|$|The first life {{arose from}} <b>abiotic</b> {{chemical}} reactions. When this happened, how it happened, and even what planet {{it happened on}} are uncertain. However, life follows the rules of and arose from lifeless chemistry and physics. It is constrained by principles such as thermodynamics. This is an important concept in the field because it is represents the epitome of the interconnectedness, if not sameness, of life and Earth.|$|E
25|$|From a {{geographical}} point of view, Lüneburg Heath {{is a specific}} natural region, that is an area distinguished by a specific combination of <b>abiotic</b> factors (climate, relief, water resources, soil, geology) and biotic factors (flora and fauna). Lüneburg Heath is a sub-division of the North European Plain. In {{the list of the}} major natural regions of Germany issued by the Federal Office for Nature Conservation (Bundesamt für Naturschutz) it is region number D28.|$|E
25|$|Within the mantle, carbon {{may exist}} as hydrocarbons—chiefly methane—and as {{elemental}} carbon, carbon dioxide, and carbonates. The <b>abiotic</b> {{hypothesis is that}} the full suite of hydrocarbons found in petroleum can either be generated in the mantle by abiogenic processes, or by biological processing of those abiogenic hydrocarbons, and that the source-hydrocarbons of abiogenic origin can migrate out of the mantle into the crust until they escape to the surface or are trapped by impermeable strata, forming petroleum reservoirs.|$|E
