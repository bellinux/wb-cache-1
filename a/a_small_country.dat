5|$|James Ferguson—known as the Sheriff, {{reflecting}} the post he held, recognised by the Society of Advocates—bought the Pitfour estate after selling {{the lands of}} Badifurrow. He had inherited Badifurrow after demanding that his uncle Robert Ferguson should appear in court if he wished to contest the inheritance. Robert, nicknamed the Plotter, was in hiding to avoid charges of treachery, and after his non-appearance in court James Ferguson's inheritance was confirmed in mid-June 1700. At that time the estate contained only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>country</b> house.|$|E
5|$|France even {{linked the}} issue of the seat to the ongoing dispute {{regarding}} the seat of the European Parliament. Frankfurt was criticised as symbolising German dominance, although the Deutsche Bundesbank had effectively been running the Communities currencies for the previous years, while Luxembourg has a banking tradition that wasn't so careful. London was discredited because the UK remained outside the eurozone. It was also seen as important to locate the bank in a city not already hosting a national government or EU institution, in order to emphasise its independence. Others, such as {{the former head of the}} Bundesbank Karl Otto Pöhl, favoured <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>country</b> with a stable currency. The advantages of hosting the Bank were also in dispute by some economists. While there was seen by some as little to gain in terms of attracting other banks and financial institutions, others saw it as affecting which cities would be financial hubs in the years to come.|$|E

5|$|Tensions {{between the}} Soviet Union and Lithuania {{escalated}} along with Germany's successes. By mid-March 1940, the Winter War with Finland {{was over and}} the Soviets could concentrate their attention on gaining control of the Baltic states. In April, after Germany occupied Denmark, a Lithuanian envoy in Moscow reported rising hostility from Russian diplomats. During May, while the Battle of France was in full swing, the Soviets intensified their rhetoric and diplomatic pressure. On May 16, shortly after the German invasion of Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands, Soviet official newspaper Izvestia published an article warning that it was naive for <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>country</b> to attempt neutrality while giants were fighting for survival. Between May 18 and May 25, Russian soldiers moved some military equipment from Vilnius to Gaižiūnai, a location {{much closer to the}} government seat in Kaunas. The action's proximity to the then-capital carried symbolic weight.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{examine how}} trade {{liberalization}} {{by a large}} trading partner affects the ability of <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>country's</b> government to sustain free trade through a reputational mechanism. Unconditional liberalization by the large trading partner has an ambiguous effect on the <b>small</b> <b>country's</b> dynamic incentives. Liberalization through a reciprocal trade agreement, in which the large country lowers its tariffs conditionally on the <b>small</b> <b>country</b> doing the same, unambiguously dominates unconditional liberalization by the large country {{as a way of}} boosting trade reforms and reinforcing policy credibility in the <b>small</b> <b>country.</b> However, if capacity in the import-competing sector can be reduced only gradually, a conditional, reciprocal agreement may require an asynchronous exchange of concessions, where the large country liberalizes before the <b>small</b> <b>country</b> does. © Canadian Economics Association...|$|R
25|$|Terminating at <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>country</b> town, the Randalstown branch was not {{generating}} as much traffic as {{the directors}} wished.

The airline ordered five new Lockheed L-749 Constellations, but a change of government and a financial crisis prevented the service from starting. John A Costello, the incoming Fine Gael Taoiseach (Prime Minister), was not a keen supporter of air travel and thought that flying the Atlantic was too grandiose a scheme for a small airline from <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>country</b> like Ireland.|$|E
