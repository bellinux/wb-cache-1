The advertisements featured customers and employees praising the new sandwiches accompanied with <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> products being sold. Actor Stuart Pankin played a doorman in one commercial in the series. Another one of the promotions used was a scratch card game called What's my Specialty? where the customer would receive a card with their purchase {{in which they would}} have to match famous people to said person's profession. The commercial explained that if you expected to lose, you would be disappointed, as all cards were winners. Prizes included fries, sodas and sandwiches.|$|E
5|$|German {{geographer}} Karl Sapper {{visited the}} ruins in 1896 and published <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ruins {{together with a}} site map two years later in a 6-page pamphlet by the Internationales Archiv für Ethnographie of Leyden in the Netherlands, entitled Die Ruinen von Mixco, Guatemala. It was Sapper who labelled each of the archaeological groups and their attendant structures. American archaeologist A. Ledyard Smith visited the ruins in 1949 and wrote a chapter about the site in his Archaeological Reconnaissance in Central America, published by the Carnegie Institution of Washington in 1955. Archeological excavations were carried out from 1954 through 1967 by the Musée de l'Homme of Paris {{under the direction of}} archaeologist Henri Lehmann, who certainly believed that he was excavating the Pocomam capital as described in Colonial records.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century Pedro Montañés {{passed through}} the site and left {{graffiti}} with his name and the year 1752. Archives have revealed {{that he was a}} Spanish captain who visited the site on 14 August of that year. La Blanca was first documented {{in the early years of}} the 20th century. In 1905 explorer Teoberto Maler identified visible architecture at the site and marked it as El Castillito on a map of the region. Raymond E. Merwin visited La Blanca in 1913 on behalf of the Peabody Museum of Harvard University. He photographed the site and renamed it as Chac-Ha. At this time the site appears to have been covered in dense vegetation, making exploration of the ruins difficult and resulting in only <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acropolis.|$|E

Rowse is one prominent example, and others have followed his leadhave exploited Forman's manuscripts for the manifold lights they throw on the less-exposed private lives of Elizabethan and Jacobean men and women. One of Forman's patients was the poet Emilia Lanier, Rowse's candidate to have been Shakespeare's Dark Lady; another patient was Mrs Mountjoy, Shakespeare's landlady. Sixty-four volumes of his manuscripts were collected by Elias Ashmole in the seventeenth century, and are now held in the Bodleian Library, Oxford.

Monro's Description of the Western Isles of Scotland also mentions Eilean Droineach and Eilean Ramsay. He stated that both were [...] "good for corn and store" [...] and had many [...] "Elders and thorns" [...] and that Eilean Droineach was the [...] "habitation of Bishops and Nobles in auld times".

The single collection was found growing on fallen oak leaves at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, in Solano County, California in January 1856. The specimen {{was sent by}} American mycologist Moses Ashley Curtis to his British colleague Miles Joseph Berkeley, who published <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> species in 1860, calling it Agaricus californiensis, {{in what was then}} the subgenus Mycena. Berkeley and Curtis noted that it differed from A.aurantio-marginatus (known today as Mycena aurantiomarginata) {{in the nature of the}} gills, and they called it [...] "a more graceful species." [...] In his 1887 Sylloge Fungorum, Pier Andrea Saccardo raised the subgenus Mycena to generic status, so the species became known as Mycena californiensis.|$|E

Attarsiya launched a campaign deploying an army that included 100 war chariots and attacked regions which were Hittite vassals, or at least under a certain decree of Hittite influence. Among them, he attacked the Hittite vassal, Madduwatta, likely a prince {{of the kingdom of}} Arzawa, and managed to expel him from his country. The latter found refuge in the court of the Hittite ruler and was installed by him as a vassal in Zipasla, somewhere in western Anatolia. Attarsiyas launched a second attack against Madduwatta and managed again to defeat him. The Hittite vassal was unable to provide any opposition and managed. As a result of Achaean military activity in the region, the Hittites dispatched an army under Kisnapli.

After what Yankovic described as [...] "considerable expense" [...] in writing, recording, and mastering the song in the studio, he contacted Gaga's management again with a completed recording of the song. He was subsequently refused permission, without Gaga listening to the track and Yankovic getting {{the impression that the}} refusal came from the singer herself. Left with a completed song and abandoned plans for an outlandish music video to promote the song and album, Yankovic released it on YouTube. It was then that Gaga actually heard the song, and personally contacted Yankovic, giving him green light to include the song on Alpocalypse, telling him that her manager had been the one to refuse permission, which was done without her knowledge or input.|$|E
