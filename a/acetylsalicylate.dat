40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThis study {{assessed}} the algesic activity of bradykinin (BK) in humans {{and the effects}} of <b>acetylsalicylate</b> on muscular and cardiac BK-induced pain. BACKGROUNDBradykinin is released by the ischemic myocardium and may be involved in the genesis of ischemic pain. METHODSIncreasing doses of BK (from 30 to 960 ng/min) were randomly infused, for periods of 2 min each, into the iliac artery of 10 patients. The same protocol was repeated 30 min after the IV administration of 1 g of <b>acetylsalicylate.</b> In eight other patients with coronary artery disease, the same increasing doses of BK, for periods of 2 min each, were infused into the left coronary artery. The same protocol was repeated 30 min after the IV administration of 1 g of <b>acetylsalicylate.</b> Time to pain onset and maximal pain severity were obtained. RESULTSBefore <b>acetylsalicylate</b> administration, all patients experienced pain during intra-iliac infusion of BK. After <b>acetylsalicylate,</b> eight patients did not experience any pain during BK infusion (p = 0. 0014), and in the two remaining patients, time to pain onset and maximal pain severity were similar to those recorded before <b>acetylsalicylate.</b> Before <b>acetylsalicylate</b> administration, all patients experienced pain similar to their habitual angina during intracoronary BK infusion. After <b>acetylsalicylate,</b> six patients did not experience any pain during BK infusion (p = 0. 0098), whereas in the two remaining patients time to pain onset and maximal pain severity were similar to those recorded before <b>acetylsalicylate.</b> CONCLUSIONSIntra-iliac infusion of BK causes muscular pain, and its intracoronary infusion in patients with coronary artery disease causes cardiac pain, which is similar to their habitual angina. The BK-induced pain is abolished or reduced by <b>acetylsalicylate,</b> thus suggesting that acetylsalicylate-sensitive mediators, such as prostaglandins, are involved in its pathogenesis...|$|E

Design and setting: This was a modelling study from the perspectives of direct medical costs, the social security system and society in France. Methods: Efficacy data for the secondary prevention of ischaemic events were derived from the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis on antithrombotics. The rates and costs of ischaemic disease and of serious gastrointestinal adverse affects arising from long term aspirin treatment, as well as the costs of treatment with lysine <b>acetylsalicylate,</b> were taken from published sources, using French data where possible. Results: From the social security perspective, the estimated cost-effectiveness ratios show that the prevention of MI in patients with a history of unstable angina (with a 1 -year follow-up) is a cost-saving strategy, with net benefits ranging from $US 5703 (1996 prices) per avoided MI for lysine <b>acetylsalicylate</b> 300 mg/day to $US 5761 per avoided MI for lysine <b>acetylsalicylate</b> 75 mg/day. The prevention of MI and stroke is also a cost-saving strategy in patients with prior MI [net benefits in a 2 -year follow-up (5 % discount rate) ranging from $US 15 to $US 494 per avoided MI and from $US 37 to $US 1170 per avoided stroke]. This was also true in patients with prior ischaemic stroke (net benefits in a 3 -year follow-up ranging from $US 610 to $US 2082 per avoided MI and from $US 176 to $US 599 per avoided stroke). Finally, a 4 -year follow-up in patients with a history of stable angina pectoris shows that prophylactic treatment with lysine <b>acetylsalicylate</b> is associated with net costs per avoided MI, ranging from $US 4375 to $US 3608 per avoided event. Sensitivity analysis confirmed that prophylaxis with lysine <b>acetylsalicylate</b> in patients at high risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events results in savings in social security expenditure. Conclusions: Our results underline the high economic benefit of using lysine <b>acetylsalicylate</b> to prevent secondary ischaemic stroke and MI in patients at high risk of cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular events, leading to savings for the social security system and society.

Fifty times {{the quantity of}} <b>acetylsalicylate</b> which just antagonized bradykinin did not modify bronchoconstriction due to small doses of histamine, 5 -hydroxytryptamine, or acetylcholine. A method of measuring the potency of this anti-bradykinin action was developed.

In most of the experimental models in which it has been tested, the protective effect of frusemide has been evaluated for only a short time after administration. In aspirin-sensitive patients, acetylsalicylic acid causes an asthmatic reaction which typically lasts for 2 h or more after exposure. We investigated the presence and duration of the protective effect of inhaled frusemide against the bronchial response to aspirin in sensitive patients, using a specific inhalation challenge with lysine <b>acetylsalicylate</b> (LASA). In the first study, eight subjects with aspirin-asthma underwent two bronchial challenges with a single dose of lysine <b>acetylsalicylate</b> administered through a jet nebulizer, after treatment with 40 mg inhaled frusemide or placebo, according to a randomized, double-blind protocol. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) was monitored for 120 min after challenge. In the second study in eight patients, the protocol was modified by the use of a dosimeter for delivery of lysine <b>acetylsalicylate,</b> by reducing the dose of lysine <b>acetylsalicylate</b> to avoid intense reactions, and by extending the follow-up to 4 h. In the first study, after placebo, FEV 1 gradually decreased, reaching a maximum decrement of 39 +/- 3 % at 120 min.

Our {{purpose was to}} investigate the clinical effectiveness of combined treatment of asthma with inhaled lysine <b>acetylsalicylate</b> and furosemide. We performed a randomized, double-blind, crossover study in nine patients with chronic asthma requiring a high dose (2 mg/day) of inhaled beclomethasone for clinical control. Patients were treated with a combination of 720 mg inhaled lysine <b>acetylsalicylate</b> and 40 mg furosemide twice daily, or with matched placebo in addition to inhaled steroids. The dose of inhaled steroids was reduced by half every 15 days and eventually suspended unless a patient's respiratory condition worsened.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharm.)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. The skin is {{an amazing}} elastic and {{relatively}} impermeable barrier that provides protective, perceptive and communication functions to the body. The stratum corneum is widely accepted as the barrier of the skin - limiting the transport of molecules into and across the skin. It is evident that the transdermal permeation of drugs depend {{on a number of}} factors of which the physicochemical properties play the most prevalent role. The potential of using intact skin as the site of administration for dermatological preparations to elicit pharmacological action in the skin tissue has been well recognised. Transdermal drug delivery offers several advantages over oral and parenteral dosing. They include avoiding hepatic first pass metabolism, maintaining constant blood levels for longer periods of time, improving bioavailabiliv, decreasing the administered dose, adverse effects and gastrointestinal side effects, easy discontinuation in case of toxic effects and improved patient compliance. Optimal transport through the skin requires a drug to possess lipophilic as well as hydrophilic properties. Research has indicated that the ideal log P value for optimal transdermal permeation is between 1 and 2. Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) possesses anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activity, and as an anti-inflammatory analgesic agent it is used in the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Its use is limited to the relief of pain and inflammation, as it does not halt the progression of the pathological injury caused to the tissue. Acetylsalicylic acid is also used in the treatment of fever, prevention of thromboembolic disorders, reducing the incidence of colon cancer and it delays the onset of Alzheimer's disease. The most common adverse effect of acetylsalicylic acid occurring with therapeutic doses is gastro-intestinal disturbances. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} determine the transderrnal penetration of acetylsalicylic acid and some of its derivatives and to establish a correlation, if any, with selected physicochemical properties. The ten derivatives of acetylsalicylic acid were prepared by esterification of acetylsalicyloyl chloride with ten different alcohols. The structures of the products were confirmed by mass spectroscopy (MS), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), infrared spectroscopy (IR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) for methyl <b>acetylsalicylate.</b> Experimental aqueous solubility and partition coefficients were determined for acetylsalicylic acid and its different derivatives at a pH of 4, 5. In vitro penetration was measured through excised female human abdominal skin in diffusion cells. The prediction software Interactive Analysis (IA) was used to predict aqueous solubility, while prediction software IA, &,Win and ACD Labs were used to predict the log P values for each derivative. None of the predicted values correlated with the experimental values. The experimental aqueous solubilily, partition coefficient and transdermal flux values were determined for acetylsalicylic acid and its derivatives. The experimental aqueous solubilily of acetylsalicylic acid (6, 56 mg/ml) was higher than that of the synthesised <b>acetylsalicylate</b> derivatives (ranging from 1, 76 x lo 3 to 3, 32 mg/ml), and the partition coefficient of acetylsalicylic acid (- 0, 85) was lower than that of its derivatives (ranging from - 0, 25 to 1, 954. There was thus a direct correlation between the aqueous solubility data and the partition coefficients. The experimental transdermal flux of acetylsalicylic acid (4733 pg/cm 2 /h) was much higher than that of its derivatives (ranging from 0, 03 to 28, 32 pg/cm 2 /h). With the ethyl derivative (28, 32 pg/cm 2 /h) and the methyl derivative (10, 06 pg/cm 2 /h) being the only derivatives with appreciable flux. Pentyl <b>acetylsalicylate</b> (0, 03 pg/cm 2 /h) had the lowest flux. The higher flux values of acetylsalicylic acid and its methyl and ethyl derivatives might be due to the fact that it is more hydrophilic and had better aqueous solubilily, thus permeating through the proteins of the skin. Pentyl <b>acetylsalicylate</b> had a log P value of 1, 95, but had the lowest flux (0, 03 pg/cm 2 /h), just proving once again that to cross the stratum corneum a drug should posses both hydrophilic and lipophilic properties. Tert-butyl <b>acetylsalicylate</b> had a flux (7, 30 &cm 2 /h) lower than that of methyl and ethyl <b>acetylsalicylate,</b> but a higher flux than the other synthesised derivatives which could be due to its log P value being slightly greater than 1 and having an average aqueous solubility. The low transdermal permeation may also be attributed to the fact that at the pH (45) chosen for transdermal studies, <b>acetylsalicylate</b> was only 9, 09 % unionised. A higher degree of unionised species results in higher flux values. This study has confirmed that transdermal flux is dependent on several factors including optimum solubility, partitioning, diffusion and the degree of ionisation in the stratum corneum in addition to a suitable partition coefficient and high aqueous solubilily. The solution to the increased transdermal delivery of lipophilc drugs does not simply lie in producing a derivative with a higher aqueous solubilily and more ideal partition coefficient. Other means of increasing the transdermal permeation of lipophilic acetylsalicylic acid derivatives will have to be investigated in further studies. Master...|$|E

All of the NSAIDs tested inhibited [14 C]PAH uptake via OAT 1 expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Ibuprofen, indo-methacin, salicylurate, and naproxen showed the strongest potency to inhibit [14 C]PAH uptake (Ki; 2 – 10 mM); acetylsa-licylate, salicylate, and phenacetin exhibited moderate potency (Ki; 300 – 400 mM), and acetaminophen (paracetamol) exhib-ited the weakest inhibitory potency (Ki; 2 mM). Radiolabeled <b>acetylsalicylate,</b> salicylate, and indomethacin were taken up by OAT 1 and the uptake rate of these three NSAIDs was enhanced by the outwardly directed dicarboxylate gradient. The efflux of the preloaded [14 C]PAH from the oocytes via OAT 1 was trans-stimulated by PAH and glutarate added to the media. The addition of salicylate, <b>acetylsalicylate,</b> or salicylurate into the media also trans-stimulated the efflux of PAH, whereas indo-methacin did not. The present study indicates that OAT 1 {{is responsible for the}} renal uptake and secretion of NSAIDs. The kidneys, along with the liver, are the main organs for drug excretion and metabolism. Three processes are involved in the renal handling of drugs: glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption, and tubular secretion. The tubular secretion of xenobiotics, especially organic anions, has been studied ex...|$|E
40|$|Phenotypic {{resistance}} to chloramphenicol and ampicillin was induced in sensitive Escherichia coli K- 12 strains during incubation {{with the following}} substances: acetate, <b>acetylsalicylate</b> (aspirin), benzoate, dimethyl sulfoxide, 1 -methyl- 2 -pyrrolidinone, and salicylate. In addition, acetyl-salicylate and salicylate induced {{resistance to}} nalidixic acid and tetracycline. The induction of resistance was highly efficient but varied somewhat with the strain and inducer used. In the presence of inducers, from 10 % to 100 % of the cells formed colonies on antibiotic media, an increase of 10 - to 1000 -fold over the controls without inducer. After growth {{in the absence of}} these inducers, the cells were normally sensitive to the antibiotics. Thus, the resistance was not due to a heritable change. These inducers also increased the level of chloramphenicol resistance of a strain carrying cat (whose gene product inactivates chloramphenicol by acetylation). All of the inducers are chemotactic repellents for E. coli, and they are detected by the tsr gene product (with the possible exceptions of dimethyl sulfoxide and methylpyrrolidinone, whose modes of detection are not known). Nickel sulfate and cobalt sulfate, repellents that are detected by the tar gene product, neither promoted resistance to chloramphenicol nor prevented the induction of resistance by <b>acetylsalicylate.</b> Since several of the inducers are present in common drugs or foods, it may be of medical importance to evaluate their effects on antibiotic therapies...|$|E
40|$|AbstractElderly {{patients}} with multiple comorbidities {{are at risk}} of experiencing adverse drug events. We report a case of skin lesion related to drugs and discuss consequences of polypharmacy in the elderly. An 85 -year-old female took the following drugs for a long time: amlodipine, valsartan, hydrochlorothiazide, lysine <b>acetylsalicylate,</b> sinvastatine, and trimetazidine. In June 2013, she presented thoracic pain and received propranolol, tramadol, and paracetamol. One week later, she developed a diffuse skin lesion. In our patient, drugs considered unnecessary were discontinued and corticosteroid was administered orally. Careful monitoring helped improve the outcome. Corticoids were dangerous but necessary to correct the consequence of iatrogeny...|$|E
