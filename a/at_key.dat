Overall, the proportion of Southcote residents with no qualifications is higher than Reading.|$|E
5|$|It was {{customary}} on all British mainline journeys {{to change}} engines at convenient locations {{to avoid the}} lengthy process of re-coaling. The Coronation locomotives were therefore strategically stationed <b>at</b> <b>key</b> points between London and Glasgow {{and they would be}} assigned to the shed at that location. The chosen locations were at London (Camden shed), Crewe (Crewe North), Carlisle (Upperby) and Glasgow (Polmadie). It was only in the latter days of steam that the mix of shed assignments became more fluid.|$|E

2500|$|Enraged at his discovery, Sickles confronted his wife. Although she {{initially}} denied everything, Teresa eventually wrote a confession. Teresa {{described her}} numerous rendezvous with <b>Key</b> <b>at</b> a rented house on 15th Street. A few days later, on Sunday, February 27, 1859, [...] Sickles saw Key outside his house, {{located on the}} west side of today's Lafayette Square, signaling Teresa with a handkerchief. Key continued walking, and Sickles sent an acquaintance outside to delay him. Sickles armed himself with several pistols, and intercepted <b>Key</b> <b>at</b> the corner of Madison Place N.W. and Pennsylvania Avenue, across the street from the White House. There, Sickles shot the unarmed Key twice, one shot directed <b>at</b> <b>Key's</b> groin. Key died about an hour later in a nearby house.|$|R

5|$|Manitoba's early economy {{depended}} on mobility and {{living off the}} land. Aboriginal Nations (Cree, Ojibwa, Dene, Sioux and Assiniboine) followed herds of bison and congregated to trade among themselves <b>at</b> <b>key</b> meeting places throughout the province. After {{the arrival of the}} first European traders in the 17th century, the economy centred on the trade of beaver pelts and other furs. Diversification of the economy came when Lord Selkirk brought the first agricultural settlers in 1811, though the triumph of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) over its competitors ensured the primacy of the fur trade over widespread agricultural colonization.|$|E

5|$|Saugus was {{decommissioned}} {{and laid}} up at Washington, D. C., on 13 June 1865. Recommissioned on 30 April 1869, the monitor steamed to Cuba to investigate reports of mistreatment of US citizens during a revolt there. She then patrolled along the Florida coast {{until she was}} laid up <b>at</b> <b>Key</b> West, Florida {{on the last day}} of 1870. During this time, the ship was renamed Centaur on 15 June 1869, but resumed her original name on 10 August 1869. After being towed to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for repairs, Saugus was recommissioned there on 9 November 1872 and was based <b>at</b> <b>Key</b> West until transferred to Port Royal, South Carolina in 1876. During this period the ship was out of commission from 9 March to 10 October 1874. Saugus returned to Washington in 1877 and was decommissioned there on 8 October. She was condemned in 1886 and sold for scrap on 25 May 1891.|$|E
5|$|The early {{attempts}} to bomb Japan from the Marianas proved just as ineffective as the China-based B-29s had been. Hansell continued {{the practice of}} conducting so-called high-altitude precision bombing, aimed <b>at</b> <b>key</b> industries and transportation networks, even after these tactics had not produced acceptable results. These efforts proved unsuccessful due to logistical difficulties with the remote location, technical problems with the new and advanced aircraft, unfavorable weather conditions, and enemy action.|$|E
5|$|The finale is in sonata form. It {{features}} significant {{developments of}} a simple motif, and considerable dialogue between the four parts. The finale also contains {{a high degree of}} chromaticism, a feature that links the four movements of the work. The musicologist W. Dean Sutcliffe points to the recurrence of C <b>at</b> <b>key</b> points in each movement, serving at different times to create dissonance, to commence modulation (music) away from the tonic, or, {{as in the case of}} the finale, as a device for inflection.|$|E

5|$|Virtual {{karyotyping}} can {{be performed}} on fresh or paraffin-embedded tumors to assess copy number at these loci.

ArrayCGH, FISH, or conventional cytogenetics cannot detect copy neutral LOH.|$|E
