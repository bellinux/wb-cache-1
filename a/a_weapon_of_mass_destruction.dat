He {{was first}} tried {{by the federal}} {{government}} in 1997 and found guilty of conspiring to build <b>a</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>destruction</b> and of eight counts of involuntary manslaughter of federal officers. After he was sentenced on June 4, 1998 to life without parole, the State of Oklahoma in 2000 sought a death-penalty conviction on 161counts of first-degree murder (160non-federal agent victims and onefetus). On May 26, 2004 the jury found him guilty on all charges, but deadlocked on the issue of sentencing him to death. Presiding Judge Steven W. Taylor then determined the sentence of 161consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole. In March 2005, FBI investigators, acting on a tip, searched a buried crawl space in Nichols' former house and found additional explosives missed in the preliminary search after Nichols was arrested.|$|E

5|$|The crew {{discover}} a wrecked Borg scout ship {{with a single}} survivor: a young Borg drone. Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) insists on treating the surviving Borg despite the concerns of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). On Picard's orders, the drone is confined and monitored by security forces at all times and is prevented from contacting the Borg Collective. Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) and Lt. Commander Data assist Crusher in bringing the Borg back to health. As they {{come to understand the}} workings of the Borg, La Forge and Data postulate an idea of using the Borg drone as <b>a</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>destruction.</b> By implanting an unsolvable geometric formula into his mind and returning him back to the Collective, the formula should rapidly spread (similar to a computer virus) and disable the Borg. Crusher is aghast at this suggestion, considering it equivalent to genocide, while Picard and the other senior crew deliberate on the ethics of this plan.|$|E
5|$|During Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny, Kira {{has been}} living in the secluded Marshall Islands {{since the end of the}} war within the country of Orb. He and Lacus have spent the past two years since the end of the war {{assisting}} Reverend Malchio and Kira's adoptive mother with their orphanage. When an incident triggers another war, Coordinators try to kill Lacus; Kira pilots Freedom to defeat them. When Orb attempts to join the war as a member of the Earth Alliance, Kira and the Arcangel intervene Orb's forces to preserve the nation's neutral status. Kira suspects Gilbert Durandal, the chairman of the PLANT colonies and leader of ZAFT, to be behind Lacus' attempted murder, but his motives are questioned by Athrun who is working in ZAFT. Later, when the Archangel becomes a target of the ZAFT ship known as Minerva, Kira is defeated and the Freedom is destroyed by pilot Shinn Asuka. Lacus gives Kira an upgraded version of Freedom, , so he can continue fighting. Having obtained <b>a</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>destruction,</b> Durandal imposes the Destiny Plan, a rule which removes freewill and dictates a person's entire life based on their genetics. Kira, the Archangel and their allies confront ZAFT's forces in space and defeat them in the final battle. Kira personally confronts Durandal and the latter is killed by one of his own subordinates.|$|E

The purpose of the {{research project}} was to develop <b>a</b> <b>Weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mass</b> Destruction Site Survey form to assist in identify potential terrorist target locations. The research employed action research (a) to determine what items {{should be included in the}} <b>Weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mass</b> Destruction Site Survey, (b) what are the different types <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction, (c) what is the best model to use for developing contingency plans for WMD events, (d) what are the obstacles to effective WMD readiness, (e) what can be done to effectively deter a terrorist organization from targeting a facility or structure within a community? The principle procedure employed was review of published materials and a survey of 100 local and national fire departments depicting their assessment of the terrorist threat against critical facilities and systems in their community. Data was compiled in graphic form to facilitate a comparison of published materials and contemporary fire department applications of assessing the terrorist threat. The major findings of this research were that few fire departments currently incorporate <b>a</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction site survey into their preplanning operations. Principle among those factors was that only 9 % of surveyed departments even have a formal process in place for evaluating the <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction potential to critical facilities within their communities...|$|R
