5|$|All {{publications}} and media {{were subjected to}} censorship. The Soviets sought to recruit Polish left-wing intellectuals {{who were willing to}} cooperate. Soon <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> invasion, the Writers' Association of Soviet Ukraine created a local chapter in Lwów; there was a Polish-language theater and radio station. Polish cultural activities in Minsk and Wilno were less organized. These activities were strictly controlled by the Soviet authorities, which saw to it that these activities portrayed the new Soviet regime in a positive light and vilified the former Polish government.|$|E
5|$|By mid-November, the Germans {{had nearly}} taken Stalingrad in bitter street {{fighting}} when the Soviets began their second winter counter-offensive, starting with an encirclement of German forces at Stalingrad and {{an assault on}} the Rzhev salient near Moscow, though the latter failed disastrously. By early February 1943, the German Army had taken tremendous losses; German troops at Stalingrad had been forced to surrender, and the front-line had been pushed back beyond its position before the summer offensive. In mid-February, <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> push had tapered off, the Germans launched another attack on Kharkov, creating a salient in their front line around the Russian city of Kursk.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, the USSR {{had built up}} a {{military}} arsenal and army surpassing that of the United States. Soon <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> invasion of Afghanistan, president Carter began massively building up the United States military. This buildup was accelerated by the Reagan administration, which increased the military spending from 5.3 percent of GNP in 1981 to 6.5 percent in 1986, the largest peacetime defense buildup in United States history.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Sikorski became Prime Minister of the Polish Government in Exile, Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Armed Forces, and a {{vigorous}} {{advocate of the}} Polish cause in the diplomatic sphere. He supported the reestablishment of diplomatic relations between Poland and the Soviet Union, which had been severed <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> pact with Germany and the 1939 invasion of Poland— however, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin broke off Soviet-Polish diplomatic relations in April 1943 following Sikorski's request that the International Red Cross investigate the Katyń Forest massacre.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, the Hungarian {{authorities}} began evacuating the Székelys {{settled in}} the occupied territories since 1941 to Transdanubia. Several days <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Red Army entered the Banat on 1 October 1944, the Germans began the evacuation of Bačka, including the local Volksdeutsche. With the advance of the Partisans and the Red Army, some of the Volksdeutsche left the region while some others stayed, despite the situation.|$|E

50|$|Estonian {{fishermen}} {{had witnessed}} {{the attack and}} crash of <b>the</b> plane. Shortly <b>after</b> <b>the</b> crash <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> submarine Shch-301 (Щ-301) surfaced and inspected <b>the</b> fishing boats. <b>After</b> confiscating items taken from the wreck by <b>the</b> fishermen, <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> picked up diplomatic mail from the wreck and the sea.

5|$|Reagan {{escalated}} the Cold War, accelerating {{a reversal}} from {{the policy of}} détente which began in 1979 <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> war in Afghanistan. Reagan ordered a massive buildup of the United States Armed Forces and implemented new policies towards the Soviet Union: reviving the B-1 Lancer program that had been canceled by the Carter administration, and producing the MX missile. In response to Soviet deployment of the SS-20, Reagan oversaw NATO's deployment of the Pershing missile in West Germany.|$|E
5|$|These policy failures, and the {{stalemate}} that ensued <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> intervention, led the Soviet leadership to become {{highly critical of}} Karmal's leadership. Under Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Union deposed Karmal and replaced him with Mohammad Najibullah. Following his loss of power, he was again exiled, this time to Moscow. He was {{allowed to return to}} Afghanistan in 1991 by the Najibullah government. Back in Afghanistan he became an associate of Abdul Rashid Dostum, and helped remove the Najibullah government from power. Not long after, in 1996, Karmal died from liver cancer.|$|E
5|$|Tătărescu {{returned}} to the PNL later in 1944 — <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Red Army had entered Romania and the country had become an Allied state, political parties were again allowed to register. Nevertheless, Tătărescu was again opposed to the party leaders Dinu and Gheorghe I. Brătianu, and split to form his own group in June–July 1945. Dinu Brătianu convened the PNL leadership and formally excluded Tătărescu and his partisans, citing their support for dictatorial regimes.|$|E

5|$|After the {{discovery}} of flerovium and livermorium was recognized by IUPAC on 1 June 2011, IUPAC asked {{the discovery}} team at the JINR to suggest permanent names for those two elements. The Dubna team chose to name element 114 flerovium (symbol Fl), after the Russian Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions (FLNR), named <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> physicist Georgy Flyorov (also spelled Flerov); earlier reports claim the element name was directly proposed to honour Flyorov. In accordance with the proposal received from the discoverers IUPAC officially named flerovium after the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions (an older name for the JINR), not after Flyorov himself. Flyorov is known for writing to Stalin in April 1942 and pointing out the silence in scientific journals {{in the field of}} nuclear fission in the United States, Great Britain, and Germany. Flyorov deduced that this research must have become classified information in those countries. Flyorov's work and urgings {{led to the development of}} the USSR's own atomic bomb project.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Soviet government's efforts, on June 14, 1987, about 5,000 people {{rallied to}} commemorate the victims of Soviet deportations. This event, {{organized}} by the human rights group Helsinki-86, {{was the first time}} <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> occupation that the flower-laying ceremony took place, as the practice was banned by the Soviet authorities. In response the Soviet government organized a bicycle race at the monument at the time when the ceremony was planned to take place. Helsinki-86 organized another flower-laying ceremony on August 23 in the same year {{to commemorate the}} anniversary of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, at which the crowd was dispersed using jets of water. Yet the independence movement grew in size, amounting in some events to {{more than half a million}} participants (about one quarter of Latvia's population) and three years later, on May 4, 1990, the re-establishment of the independence of Latvia was declared.|$|E
5|$|In August 1939 Cunningham rejoined his {{squadron}} {{which had}} been equipped with {{a version of the}} Bristol Blenheim. John was not enthusiastic about flying the Blenheim. The turret had been eliminated to reduce weight and increase speed, but the flying suits and cockpit were not heated, which caused discomfort to the crews over the winter period. The radios were too short-range which caused communication problems. The Blenheim's cockpit windshield was multi-faceted and difficult to clean. It was also liable to reflect light; which made cooperation with searchlights hazardous. The unit also had unspecified problems with blind-flying instruments. The squadron incurred some losses owing to the inexperience of crews flying patrols over the North Sea from RAF North Weald in Essex, a number of them a result of the difficulties with the aircraft. In January 1940 604 moved to RAF Northolt and flew Blenheim's adorned in the Finnish Air Force Swastika to Finland via Sweden to assist the country <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> invasion.|$|E

5|$|In Cold Blood is {{situated}} in Volgia, a fictional state {{on the east coast}} of the former USSR. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union collapsed, Dmitri Nagarov, chief of intelligence and security, took the opportunity to overthrow existing powers and declared independence. After his coup, Volgia started to invade its neighbors. The Volgian Freedom Fighters (VFF) is a resistance movement that is run by Gregor Kostov. The VFF has learned that the Volgians have acquired some special technology and has informed the Americans. They sent a spy named Kiefer to investigate, but communications were lost while he was investigating a uranium mine. The British were asked for help, and Alpha, the boss of MI6, sends agent John Cord, a long-time friend of Kiefer, to investigate.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1917 Russian Revolution, Belarus declared independence as the Belarusian People's Republic, which was conquered by Soviet Russia. The Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia became a founding constituent republic of the Soviet Union in 1922 and was renamed as the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (Byelorussian SSR). Belarus lost almost half of its territory to Poland after the Polish–Soviet War of 1919–1921. Much of the borders of Belarus took their modern shape in 1939, when some lands of the Second Polish Republic were reintegrated into it <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> invasion of Poland, and were finalized after World WarII. During WWII, military operations devastated Belarus, which lost about a third of its population {{and more than half of}} its economic resources. The republic was redeveloped in the post-war years. In 1945 the Byelorussian SSR became a founding member of the United Nations, along with the Soviet Union and the Ukrainian SSR.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, Bure {{competed for}} the Soviet Union and Russia. As {{a member of}} the Soviet Union, he won two silver medals and a gold in three World Junior Championships, {{followed}} by a gold and a silver medal in the 1990 and 1991 World Championships, respectively. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union was dissolved in 1991, Bure competed for Russia in two Winter Olympics, claiming silver at the 1998 Games in Nagano as team captain, and bronze at the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City. Following Bure's retirement in 2005, he was named the general manager for Russia's national team at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. Bure was later recognized for his international career as a 2012 inductee in the International Ice Hockey Federation Hall of Fame.|$|E
50|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> {{successfully}} suppressed <b>the</b> revolution, Király {{fled to the}} United States through Austria {{to avoid}} capture.

5|$|Pro-independence {{members were}} elected in the {{majority}} to the Armenian parliament in the 1990 election. On 23 August 1990, the Armenian parliament passed a resolution on sovereignty. The tensions grew even larger <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> and Azeri forces deported thousands of Armenian from Shahumyan during Operation Ring in April and May 1991. After the unsuccessful August Putsch, more Soviet republics declared independence. On 2 September 1991, the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic proclaimed independence. On 21 September 1991, the Armenian independence referendum was held with the overwhelming majority voting for the independence of Armenia from the Soviet Union. On 26 November 1991, the Azerbaijani parliament abolished the autonomy of Nagorno-Karabakh. On 10 December 1991, an independence referendum was held in Nagorno-Karabakh, boycotted by the Azeri minority, and gained a vote of 99% in favor of independence.|$|E
5|$|Project A119, {{also known}} as A Study of Lunar Research Flights, was a top-secret plan {{developed}} in 1958 by the United States Air Force. The aim {{of the project was}} to detonate a nuclear bomb on the Moon which would help in answering some of the mysteries in planetary astronomy and astrogeology. If the explosive device detonated on the surface, not in a lunar crater, the flash of explosive light would have been faintly visible to people on earth with their naked eye, a show of force resulting in a possible boosting of domestic morale in the capabilities of the United States, a boost that was needed <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union took an early lead in the Space Race and was also working on a similar project.|$|E
5|$|Shortly <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> proposal, Macmillan {{met with}} Eisenhower at Camp David {{to devise a}} response. The Anglo-American counterproposal agreed to ban small {{underground}} tests (those under magnitude 4.75) on a temporary basis (a duration of roughly 1 year, versus the Soviet proposal of 4–5 years), but this could only happen after verifiable tests had been banned and a seismic research group (the Seismic Research Program Advisory Group) convened. The Soviet Union responded positively to the counterproposal and the research group convened on 11 May 1960. The Soviet Union also offered to keep an underground ban out of the treaty under negotiation. In May 1960, there were high hopes that an agreement would be reached at an upcoming summit of Eisenhower, Khrushchev, Macmillan, and Charles de Gaulle of France in Paris.|$|E
50|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> recaptured <b>the</b> Nazi camps, Sruoga {{continued}} {{to be held in}} the same camp. However, in 1945, he returned to Vilnius and continued teaching at Vilnius University, where he wrote the dramas Pajūrio kurortas and Barbora Radvilaitė.|$|R
