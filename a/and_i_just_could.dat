This sounds like a summer, R&B classic joint' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>could</b> not hear anyone else on it but Chris Brown. So I reached out to Ester Dean and I said, 'Could you write something for Chris Brown?' Because she's amazing with writing and especially for his voice, she has a great skill to write for his tone and she sent it, I fell in love with it, you know 'cause everybody has had a relationship like this song is talking about, so I went in and I wrote my rap, cause I'm rapping and singing in the song, and when we put it all together and let people hear it, everybody was like, this is a hit, release this ASAP." [...] "Right by My Side" [...] is an upbeat take on a downtempo ballad. The song is also heavily influenced by pop, and features a [...] "glossy", [...] "bubbly" [...] production. Some critics found similarities between [...] "Right by My Side" [...] and other songs by fellow female R&B artists, specifically Jordin Sparks and Rihanna. Both Justin Ray of Billboard, Andrew Hampp of Billboard, and Robbie Daw of Idolator found the lyrics and themes similar to those of Sparks 2008 single [...] "No Air" [...] which also featured Brown, Andrew Unterberger of Popdust felt the song was a more successful version of Rihanna's [...] "You da One".|$|E

The sweater is really coming in handy; it is so full of warmth and comfort, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>could</b> not {{have asked for a}} better fit. May I {{thank you very much for}} your thoughtfulness in sending me such an excellent gift. The package was received on 18 December [...] quite some time ago, but this has been the first time I’ve had to myself to take care of some personal correspondence. The reason is that a couple days after, we were forced to face the enemy; and since then, we were on the go right along. Rather a nice way to have spent the holidays, isn’t it? As a result of all the commotion, I lost all of my personal belongings plus my Christmas packages which I had received a few days before. The only gift which was saved was your sweater, and only because I was wearing it. I’m so glad now that I had it on my person, otherwise I would have lost it too. In closing, may I express my wishes for the continued success of the Bryant Service Club, and once again, thank you very much. Sincerely, 								John 										[Transcription ends...|$|E

5000|$|It took almost {{thirty-five years}} before Janáček {{returned}} to the composition of music for the same combination of instruments. The sonata {{was created in the}} period of composer’s marked interest in chamber music (Piano Trio (now lost), 1908, Pohádka (Fairy Tale) for cello and piano, 1910), and also at the beginning of World War I. The composer himself remembers: [...] "...in the 1914 Sonata for violin <b>and</b> piano <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> about hear sound of the steel clashing in my troubled head...". The Sonata was printed after many corrections in mid-1922 by Hudební matice in Prague. Its first performance was given by violinist František Kudláček with Jaroslav Kvapil at the piano on 24 April 1922 at the concert of new Moravian music organized by the Young Composer’s Club in Brno. The first performance abroad took place in Frankfurt in 1923. The violin part was performed by the German composer Paul Hindemith.|$|R

When asked why she cast Fenn for two different roles on Gilmore Girls, Sherman-Palladino explained: [...] I love Sherilyn so much <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't care.

[...] One of his students on the first day asked what the class was going to learn about [...] "revolutionary tactics," [...] and he later recalled that his immediate response was to suggest that he hoped students would learn skills of critical thinking and effective writing—and that these could be quite revolutionary.|$|R

Instantly the huskies answered, every clog breaking out into indescribable frenzied wailings, as a collie responds in agony to certain chords of music that stir all the old wolf nature sleeping within him. For five minutes the uproar was appalling; then it ceased abruptly and the huskies ran wildly here and there among the rocks. From far away an answer, an echo perhaps of their wailing, or, it may be, the cry of the dogs of St. Margaret's, came ululating over the deep. Then silence again, vast and unnatural, settling over the gloomy land like a winding-sheet.|$|R
5000|$|Švorcová was a devote {{supporter}} of Communism and a {{supporter of}} the former Communist government of Czechoslovakia. In 1976, Švorcová was appointed to the leadership of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. She openly condemned the signatories of Charter 77, who included Pavel Kohout and Václav Havel, as [...] "traitors" [...] to Communism and the country. She reiterated her disapproval of Charter 77 in a December 2010 interview with a Czech Radio reporter, [...] "I think it’s wrong when someone finds out that they could not cope with the idea they helped to bring about. There were many, such as Pavel Kohout, who also believed the idea, but then they couldn’t cope with it and so they abandoned it. I think that’s wrong." [...] Švorcová openly described her shock at the violence inflicted on protesters during the Prague Spring and subsequent invasion, but said she could never join the protests saying, [...] "soon as people started to attack the Soviet Union, calling them fascists <b>and</b> so on, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>could</b> not do that. I absolutely couldn’t do that." [...] Due to her communist views, Švorcová's fellow actors at the Vinohrady Theatre, who supported the Velvet Revolution, no longer supported her work at the theater after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia.|$|R
60|$|I {{was long}} wrapt by such ideas; but the soul wearies of a pauseless flight; and, stooping from its {{wheeling}} circuits {{round and round}} this spot, suddenly it fell ten thousand fathom deep, into the abyss of the present-- into self-knowledge--into tenfold sadness. I roused myself--I cast off my waking dreams; <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> who <b>just</b> now <b>could</b> almost hear the shouts of the Roman throng, and was hustled by countless multitudes, now beheld the desart ruins of Rome sleeping under its own blue sky; the shadows lay tranquilly on the ground; sheep were grazing untended on the Palatine, and a buffalo stalked down the Sacred Way {{that led to the}} Capitol. I was alone in the Forum; alone in Rome; alone in the world. Would not one living man --one companion in my weary solitude, be worth all the glory and remembered power of this time-honoured city? Double sorrow--sadness, bred in Cimmerian caves, robed my soul in a mourning garb. The generations I had conjured up to my fancy, contrasted more strongly with the end of all --the single point in which, as a pyramid, the mighty fabric of society had ended, while I, on the giddy height, saw vacant space around me.|$|R
500|$|Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe {{wrote that}} the song [...] "is totally shameless and {{completely}} effective" [...] as it [...] "derives much of its charm from a hefty sample of Michael Jackson's 'Human Nature'". Joanne Dorken of MTV UK {{wrote that the}} sample gives [...] "the tune an instant eighties feel". Najah Goldstein of radio station WNOW-FM wrote that the song is [...] "shows a much softer side of Chris Brown", and further added that it's [...] "definitely a song for the ladies...maybe even for pop star Rihanna." [...] Margaret Wappler of Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "the sentiment of the song is refreshingly complex." [...] Hannah Ash of The Harber Herald wrote that on F.A.M.E., [...] "She Ain't You" [...] and [...] "Up to You" [...] are [...] "the perfect sweet and cute love songs". While reviewing the album, Sean Fennessey of The Washington Post wrote that [...] "a more appropriate application appears on 'She Ain’t You', which interpolates Michael Jackson's 'Human Nature'. Jackson {{has long been the}} emotional, physical and musical forebear to Brown. But on 'She Ain’t You' he begs the comparison, and it isn’t pretty." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times wrote that Brown [...] "has a really charmless way with a lyric, as on 'She Ain’t You'—"When I'm with her it's only 'bout the sex / With you I had a bad romance / <b>And</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> trade her in I would"—and a voice nowhere near strong enough to make up for it." [...] The song was nominated for Song of the Year at the 2011 Soul Train Music Awards, and Top R Song at the 2012 Billboard Music Awards.|$|R
60|$|Everybody will, I hope, {{admit that}} {{this state of}} things is intolerable; that the subject of Mrs Warren's {{profession}} must be either tapu altogether, or else exhibited with the warning side as freely displayed as the tempting side. But many persons will vote for a complete tapu, and an impartial sweep from the boards of Mrs Warren and Gretchen and the rest; in short, for banishing the sexual instincts from the stage altogether. Those who think this impossible can hardly have considered the number and importance of the subjects which are actually banished from the stage. Many plays, among them Lear, Hamlet, Macbeth, Coriolanus, Julius Caesar, have no sex complications: the thread of their action can be followed by children who could not understand a single scene of Mrs Warren's Profession or Iris. None of our plays rouse the sympathy of the audience by an exhibition of the pains of maternity, as Chinese plays constantly do. Each nation has its own particular set of tapus {{in addition to the}} common human stock; and though each of these tapus limits the scope of the dramatist, it does not make drama impossible. If the Examiner were to refuse to license plays with female characters in them, he would only be doing to the stage what our tribal customs already do to the pulpit <b>and</b> the bar. <b>I</b> have myself written a rather entertaining play with only one woman in it, and she is quite heartwhole; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> as easily write a play without a woman in it at all. I will even {{go so far as to}} promise the Mr Redford my support if he will introduce this limitation for part of the year, say during Lent, so as to make a close season for that dullest of stock dramatic subjects, adultery, and force our managers and authors to find out what all great dramatists find out spontaneously: to wit, that people who sacrifice every other consideration to love are as hopelessly unheroic on the stage as lunatics or dipsomaniacs. Hector is the world's hero; not Paris nor Antony.|$|R

6000|$|The Dawn was {{plunging}} onward with {{a momentum}} to dash in splinters, did she strike any resisting object, and yawing herself sufficiently {{to render the}} passage hazardous. But the stranger made the matter ten-fold worse. When I first saw him, in this fearful proximity, his broadside was nearly offered to the seas, and away he was flying, on the summit of a mountain of foam, fairly crossing our fore-foot. At the next moment, he fell off before the wind, again, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> see his tops directly ahead. His sheer had been to-port, our intention having been to pass him on his starboard side; but, perceiving him to steer so wild, I {{thought it might be}} well to go in the other direction. Quick as the words could be uttered, therefore, I called out to port the helm. This was done, of course; and just as the Dawn felt the new influence, the other vessel took the same sheer, and away we both went to starboard, at precisely the same instant. I shouted to right our helm to [...] "hard a-starboard," [...] and it was well I did; a minute more would have brought us down headlong on the Englishman. Even now we could only see his hull, at instants; but the awful proximity of his spars denoted {{the full extent of the}} danger. Luckily, we hit on opposite directions, or our common destruction would have been certain. But, it was one thing, in that cauldron of a sea, to determine on a course, and another to follow it. As we rose on the last wave that alone separated us from the stranger, he was nearly ahead; and as we glanced onward, I saw that we should barely clear his larboard quarter. Our helm being already a starboard, no more could be done. Should he take another sheer to port, we must infallibly cut him in twain. As I have said, he had jammed his helm to-port, and slowly, and with a species of reluctance, he inclined a little aside. Then we came up, both ships rolling off, or our yards must have interlocked, and passing his quarter with our bows, we each felt the sheer at the same instant, and away we went asunder, the sterns of the ships looking at each other, and certainly not a hundred feet apart. A shout from Talcott drew me to our taffrail, and standing on that of our neighbour, what or whom should I see waving his hat, but the red countenance of honest Moses Marble! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I have {{discovered}} the mystery of Powell's disappearances. The fellow used to run {{into one of these}} narrow tidal creeks on the Essex shore. These creeks are so inconspicuous that till I had studied the chart pretty carefully I did not know of their existence. One afternoon, I made Powell's boat out, heading into the shore. By the time I got close to the mud-flat his craft had disappeared inland. But I could see the mouth of the creek by then. The tide being on the turn I took the risk of getting stuck in the mud suddenly and headed in. All I had to guide me was the top of the roof of some sort of small building. I got in more by good luck than by good management. The sun had set some time before; my boat glided in a sort of winding ditch between two low grassy banks; on both sides of me was the flatness of the Essex marsh, perfectly still. All I saw moving was a heron; he was flying low, and disappeared in the murk. Before I had gone half a mile, I was up with the building the roof of which I had seen from the river. It looked like a small barn. A row of piles driven into the soft bank in front of it and supporting a few planks made a sort of wharf. All this was black in the falling dusk, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> distinguish the whitish ruts of a cart-track stretching over the marsh towards the higher land, far away. Not a sound was to be heard. Against the low streak of light in the sky I could see the mast of Powell's cutter moored to the bank some twenty yards, no more, beyond that black barn or whatever it was. I hailed him with a loud shout. Got no answer. After making fast my boat <b>just</b> astern, <b>I</b> walked along the bank {{to have a look at}} Powell's. Being so much bigger than mine she was aground already. Her sails were furled; the slide of her scuttle hatch was closed and padlocked. Powell was gone. He had walked off into that dark, still marsh somewhere. I had not seen a single house anywhere near; there did not seem to be any human habitation for miles; and now as darkness fell denser over the land I couldn't see the glimmer of a single light. However, I supposed that there must be some village or hamlet not very far away; or only one of these mysterious little inns one comes upon sometimes in most unexpected and lonely places.|$|R
