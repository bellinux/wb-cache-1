5|$|In a 2013 study, Yule et al. {{looked into}} mental health variances between Caucasian heterosexuals, homosexuals, bisexuals, and asexuals. The results of 203 male and 603 female {{participants}} {{were included in}} the findings. Yule et al. found that asexual male participants {{were more likely to report}} having <b>a</b> <b>mood</b> disorder than other males, particularly in comparison to the heterosexual participants. The same was found for female asexual participants over their heterosexual counterparts; however, non-asexual, non-heterosexual females had the highest rates. Asexual participants of both sexes were more likely to have anxiety disorders than heterosexual and non-heterosexual participants, as were they more likely than heterosexual participants to report having had recent suicidal feelings. Yule et al. hypothesised that some of these differences may be due to discrimination and other societal factors.|$|E
5|$|It was mid-September before {{news of the}} {{declaration}} of independence spread to the outer islands, and many Indonesians far from the capital Jakarta did not believe it. As the news spread, most Indonesians came to regard themselves as pro-Republican, and <b>a</b> <b>mood</b> of revolution swept across the country. External power had shifted; it would be weeks before Allied Forces entered Indonesia, and the Dutch were too weakened by World War II. The Japanese, on the other hand, were required by the terms of the surrender to both lay down their arms and maintain order; a contradiction that some resolved by handing weapons to Japanese-trained Indonesians.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{naturally}} only {{occurs in}} traces in biological systems {{and has no}} known biological role, but does have effects on the body when ingested. Lithium carbonate is used as <b>a</b> <b>mood</b> stabiliser in psychiatry to treat bipolar disorder (manic-depression) in daily doses of about 0.5 to 2grams, although there are side-effects. Excessive ingestion of lithium causes drowsiness, slurred speech and vomiting, among other symptoms, and poisons the central nervous system, which is dangerous as the required dosage of lithium to treat bipolar disorder is only slightly lower than the toxic dosage. Its biochemistry, {{the way it is}} handled by the human body and studies using rats and goats suggest that it is an essential trace element, although the natural biological function of lithium in humans has yet to be identified.|$|E

5|$|The {{music for}} the 2011 neo-noir detective video game L.A. Noire, {{developed}} by Team Bondi and published by Rockstar Games, was composed by musicians Andrew Hale and Simon Hale. Recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, the score also features contributions from Woody Jackson, who had collaborated with Rockstar on previous projects. Andrew Hale felt that composing the game's score was about setting <b>a</b> <b>mood,</b> attempting to compose music that felt accessible to players. The score was inspired by films from the 1940s, though the team avoided specifically composing for this time period, instead opting {{to focus on that}} after the music had been produced. Three supplementary vocal recordings were composed by The Real Tuesday Weld and performed by Claudia Brücken; they also sought to fit with the game's setting.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} music are {{traditionally}} associated with Marrakesh. Berber music is influenced by Andalusian classical music and typified by its oud accompaniment. By contrast, Gnaoua music is loud and funky with a sound reminiscent of the Blues. It is performed on handmade instruments such as castanets, ribabs (three-stringed banjos) and deffs (handheld drums). Gnaoua music's rhythm and crescendo take the audience into <b>a</b> <b>mood</b> of trance; the style {{is said to have}} emerged in Marrakesh and Essaouira as a ritual of deliverance from slavery. More recently, several Marrakesh female music groups have also risen to popularity.|$|E

5000|$|<b>A</b> realis <b>mood</b> (abbreviated [...] ) is <b>a</b> {{grammatical}} <b>mood</b> {{which is}} used principally to indicate that something is a statement of fact; in other words, to express what the speaker considers to be a known state of affairs, as in declarative sentences. Most languages have <b>a</b> single realis <b>mood</b> called the indicative mood, although some languages have additional realis moods, for example to express different levels of certainty.

5|$|Also {{noting the}} unachievable {{ambition}} {{of solving the}} conflict between naturalism and religion, Martin A Greenman, remarks that one must come to the book “with a certain mood”. Too critical <b>a</b> <b>mood</b> would blind the reader to its religious insights, while the sensitivity and depth of its philosophic insights would be lost {{if one were to}} approach it in a too enthusiastically religious mood. Greenman finishes by justifying Stace’s philosophy to logical positivists by quoting from Wittgenstein's Tractatus: “My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them….He must surmount these propositions: then he sees the world rightly” (6. 54.) Dorothy M. Emmet found issue with the notion that the mystical experience is the point of intersection between the temporal and eternal orders. She writes that there are difficulties in Stace defining these orders as two distinct “orders of being”, rather than just as a way of speaking, because this then means some statements about the temporal order are relevant to what is said about the eternal order and vice versa. Indeed, the interrelation between these two orders is difficult to maintain. She also questioned Stace’s characterisation of mystical consciousness as being the same everywhere.|$|E
5|$|Relations {{broke down}} {{once more in}} 1067 with the {{ascension}} of Emperor Shenzong of Song, and in the 1070s the Song had considerable success in capturing Tangut territory. <b>A</b> <b>mood</b> of frontier adventurism permeated Shenzong's court, {{as well as a}} desire to reclaim territories he felt belonged to him as the rightful ruler of China; when a Song general led an unprovoked attack on a Western Xia border town, Shenzong appeared at the border to commend the general himself. To punish the Western Xia and damage their economy, Emperor Shenzong also shut down all commercial border markets along the Song-Western Xia border. The scientist and statesman Shen Kuo (1031–1095) was sent to Yanzhou (now Yan'an, Shaanxi province) in 1080 to stave off Tangut military invasion. He successfully defended his fortified position, yet the new Grand Councillor Cai Que held him {{responsible for the death of}} a rival Song military officer and the decimation of that officer's forces; as a result, Shen Kuo was ousted from office and the state abandoned the projected land that Shen was able to defend.|$|E
5|$|Several {{other uses}} have been {{researched}} for bupropion. There has been controversy {{about whether it}} is useful to add an antidepressant such as bupropion to <b>a</b> <b>mood</b> stabilizer in people with bipolar depression, but recent reviews have concluded that bupropion in this situation does no significant harm and may sometimes give significant benefit. Bupropion has shown no effectiveness in the treatment of cocaine dependence, but there is weak evidence that it may be useful in treating methamphetamine dependence. Based on studies indicating that bupropion lowers the level of the inflammatory mediator TNF-alpha, there have been suggestions that it might be useful in treating inflammatory bowel disease or other autoimmune conditions, but very little clinical evidence is available. Bupropion—like other antidepressants, with the exception of duloxetine (Cymbalta)—is not effective in treating chronic low back pain. It does, however, show some promise in the treatment of neuropathic pain.|$|E
30|$|We also {{predicted}} that positive reflection when in <b>a</b> negative <b>mood</b> would have greater momentary benefits than when in <b>a</b> positive <b>mood.</b> Positive reflection is often invoked naturally as an emotion-regulation strategy to reduce negative affect (Erber and Erber 1994; Bryant et al. 2005; Wildschut et al. 2006). In contrast, if already in <b>a</b> positive <b>mood,</b> {{there may be}} reduced room for improvement, experiencing a ceiling effect for positive reflection.|$|R

25|$|The acute {{treatment}} of a manic episode of bipolar disorder involves the utilization of either <b>a</b> <b>mood</b> stabilizer (valproate, lithium, or carbamazepine) or an atypical antipsychotic (olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, or aripiprazole).
