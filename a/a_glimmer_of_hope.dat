In the second match against Germany, again he was a substitute, but came on for Dutch captain Mark van Bommel and took the captain's armband. In the second half he created more attacking chances, which led to a goal, but they again lost the match. In the final group match against Portugal, Van der Vaart started as captain, and scored a goal that gave the Netherlands <b>a</b> <b>glimmer</b> <b>of</b> <b>hope</b> {{to get out of the}} group. However, two goals from Cristiano Ronaldo gave Portugal a 2–1 win and knocked out the Netherlands.|$|E

The club were pit in Group A alongside Dempo SC, East Bengal, Sporting Clube de Goa and Royal Wahingdoh. All group stage games were played at Fatorda Stadium, Goa. The team lost their first game 2–1 against newbies Royal Wahingdoh with Josimar scoring the consolation goal in the game. A solitary Samapth Kutty Mani goal in the 1–0 win against Sporting Goa gave Mumbai <b>a</b> <b>glimmer</b> <b>of</b> <b>hope</b> {{to qualify for the}} semi-finals. In the next game against East Bengal unfortunately ended in a 0–0 draw. Mumbai's inability to finish their chances cost them a win although the draw left them top of the Group. The last game against Dempo ended in a 2–0 defeat for Mumbai which knocked Mumbai out of the Federation Cup.|$|E

Cristiano Ronaldo put the hosts in the lead from a corner kick midway through the first half, and just before the hour mark Maniche made it 2–0 for Portugal with a {{spectacular}} goal from the corner of the penalty area. An own goal from Jorge Andrade gave the Netherlands <b>a</b> <b>glimmer</b> <b>of</b> <b>hope.</b> Portugal came close to scoring a third goal that was only stopped by Wilfred Bouma's blocking attempt. The game ended 2–1 to Portugal and the hosts, after their opening day failure, were through to the final of their European Championship. The Czech Republic looked likely candidates to face the hosts in the final. They were favorites to take the trophy, having won all four games. However, they would have to see off the upstart Greeks to do so. The Czechs had several chances, including a shot from Tomáš Rosický that struck the bar. The game remained goalless, until the dying moments {{of the first half of}} extra-time, when Traianos Dellas headed home the winner, the first and only silver goal in a European Championship.|$|E

25|$|Adam Gilchrist, Simon Katich and Shane Warne all {{played a}} part in getting Australia past 100, with their scores in the 20s, but Harmison – coming back for a second spell – wrapped them up with {{variations}} in length along with his ever-reliant pace. He finished with five for 43, allowing Glenn McGrath to be stranded on 10 not out, and McGrath was to take centre stage when England batted. They survived six overs until tea, scoring ten runs, but McGrath, who bowled his usual accurate line and length and got the odd ball to move, reaped massive rewards. Marcus Trescothick fell first ball after tea, edging to slip, and Strauss fell in similar fashion three balls later. Michael Vaughan and Ian Bell were shaken up, but survived six overs – before McGrath started the torture again. They were both bowled, as was Andrew Flintoff, and England had lost five wickets for 21 runs, with five of their front line batsmen out in single figures. However, Kevin Pietersen and Geraint Jones gave England <b>a</b> <b>glimmer</b> <b>of</b> <b>hope,</b> pairing up for 58 before Brett Lee's reverse-swing with the old ball induced a backward edge off Jones' bat to Adam Gilchrist. Ashley Giles hit two quick boundaries, but a short pacy ball from Lee undid him, and England were 92 for 7 overnight – needing 98 for the last three wickets to get level with Australia.|$|E
25|$|Botham {{continued}} to play for England under Brearley and achieved the highpoint {{of his career in}} the next three Tests as England recovered to win The Ashes. In the third Test at Headingley, Australia opened with 401 for 9 declared, despite good bowling by Botham who took 6 for 95. England responded poorly and were dismissed for 174. Botham was the only batsman to perform at all well and scored 50, which was his first Test half-century since he had been awarded the captaincy thirteen Tests earlier. Having been forced to follow-on, England collapsed again and at 135 for 7 on the afternoon of the fourth day, an innings defeat looked certain. Bookmakers had reportedly been offering odds of 500/1 against an England win after the follow-on was enforced. Botham, himself not long at the wicket, was the remaining recognised batsman as he was joined by the fast bowler Graham Dilley, number nine in the batting order, with only Chris Old and Bob Willis to come. With able support from Dilley (56) and Old (29), Botham hit out and by the close of play was 145 not out with Willis hanging on at the other end on 1 not out. England's lead was just 124 but there remained <b>a</b> <b>glimmer</b> <b>of</b> <b>hope.</b> On the final day's play, there was time for four more runs from Botham before Willis was out and Botham was left on 149 not out. Australia, with plenty of time remaining, needed 130 to win and were generally expected to get them. After Botham took the first wicket, Willis took 8 for 43 to dismiss Australia for only 111. England had won by 18 runs and it was {{only the second time in}} history that a team following on had won a Test match.|$|E

The event was a near sellout of 13,022 at the MGM Grand Arena and sold 150,000 pay per view buys, a rate roughly double that of the previous Zuffa events. The event featured a card headlined by a highly anticipated championship grudge match between then-current UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Tito Ortiz and former UFC Superfight Champion Ken Shamrock, who had previously left to professional wrestling in the WWE before returning to MMA.

UFC 40 also garnered mainstream attention from massive media outlets such as ESPN and USA Today, something that was unfathomable for mixed martial arts at that point in time. Many have suggested that the success of UFC 40 and the anticipation for Ortiz vs. Shamrock saved the UFC from bankruptcy; the buyrates of the previous Zuffa shows averaged a mere 45,000 buys per event and the company was suffering deep monetary losses. The success of UFC 40 provided <b>a</b> <b>glimmer</b> <b>of</b> <b>hope</b> for the UFC and kept alive the hope that mixed martial arts could become big. Beyond the rivalry itself, the success of UFC 40 was due in part to the marketing and outreach power of crossover athletes - from Pro Wrestling to MMA and MMA to Pro Wrestling - a practice with roots in Japan's Pride Fighting Championships.
