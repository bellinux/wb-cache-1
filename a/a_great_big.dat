5|$|Journalist Ralph McGill, once a {{teammate}} of Cody's, said: He was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>big</b> fellow {{and one of}} the most seriously dedicated fellows I've ever met. He was a farm boy and he didn't have any polish but he was very honest and sincere. He didn't have scholarshipwe had none in those days but he had a real job. He literally cleaned the gymnasium every day, cleaned up the locker rooms and the showers, and tended to the coal furnace after practice. He was a big man, squarely built, quiet, almost shy, and enormously decent. He practiced long hours to place kick and became the team's place kicker. He wasn't fast, but he was fast for a big man. He didn't like to wear pads. He got a hold of an old quilt and sewed it to the shoulders of the jersey and that was all the padding he wore.|$|E

500|$|Webster {{found the}} casting of Darcy {{especially}} hard {{due to the}} character's iconic status and because [...] "Colin Firth cast a very long shadow" [...] as the 1995 Darcy. Wright later commented that his choice of Knightley allowed him to cast comparative unknown Matthew Macfadyen, something {{that would have been}} impossible had he chosen a less well-known actress for Elizabeth Bennet. Macfadyen at the time was known {{for his role in the}} British television spy series Spooks, but had no recognition internationally. A fan of the actor's television work, Wright called Macfadyen [...] "a proper manly man... I didn't want a pretty boy kind of actor.

[...] "Telepathy" [...] also reached number 31 on the Billboard Twitter Top Tracks. Elsewhere, the song failed to replicate the same success. It reached the top 40 on the Urban chart in the Flanders region of Belgium, where it peaked at number 38 and spent {{a total of three}} weeks on the chart.

500|$|The {{trial began}} on May 9, 1951. Colonel Eric Pepler, a World War I veteran and British Columbia's deputy {{attorney}} general, led for the Crown while Diefenbaker led for the defence. To a CNR official on the stand, Diefenbaker said, [...] "I suppose {{the reason you}} put these soldiers in wooden cars with steel cars on either end was so {{that no matter what}} they might subsequently find in Korea, they'd always be able to say, 'Well we had worse than that in Canada'." [...] Colonel Pepler objected, stating that Diefenbaker had not asked a question. Diefenbaker responded, [...] "My Lord, it was made clear by the elevation of my voice {{at the end of the}} sentence that there was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>big</b> question mark on it." [...] The judge, Justice A.D. McFarlane, began to rule, but Pepler interjected, [...] "I want to make it clear that in this case we are not concerned about the death of a few privates going to Korea." [...] Pepler intended to remind the judge that Atherton was charged in relation to the death of only the troop train fireman, but Diefenbaker pounced: [...] "Oh, you're not concerned about the killing of a few privates? Oh, Colonel!" [...] Diefenbaker recounted that a veteran, sitting on the jury, expressed shock at Pepler's comment, and Diefenbaker lost no opportunity during the rest of the trial to address Pepler as [...] "Colonel".|$|E
500|$|New York Dolls {{features}} 10 original {{songs and}} 1 cover—the 1963 Bo Diddley song [...] "Pills". Johansen described the album as [...] "a little jewel of urban folk art". Rundgren, {{on the other}} hand, said the band's sensibilities were different from [...] "the urban New York thing" [...] {{because they had been}} raised outside Manhattan and drew on carefree rock and roll and Brill Building pop influences such as the Shangri-Las: [...] "Their songs, as punky as they were, usually {{had a lot to do}} with the same old boy-girl thing but in a much more inebriated way." [...] Johansen quoted the lyric [...] "you'd best believe I'm in love L-U-V" [...] from the Shangri-Las' [...] "Give Him <b>a</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Big</b> Kiss" [...] (1964) when he opened [...] "Looking for a Kiss", which tells a story of adolescent romantic desire hampered by peers who use drugs. On [...] "Subway Train", he used lyrics from the American folk standard [...] "Someone's in the Kitchen with Dinah". In the opinion of critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the album's rowdy hard rock songs also revamped riffs from Chuck Berry and the Rolling Stones, resulting in music that sounded edgy and threatening in spite of the New York Dolls' wittingly kitsch and camp sensibilities. [...] "Personality Crisis" [...] featured raunchy dual guitars, boogie-woogie piano, and a histrionic pause, while [...] "Trash" [...] was a punky pop rock song with brassy singing.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} four stars and praised it as [...] "a {{skillful}} thriller", saying that Deep Blue Sea [...] "is essentially one well-done action sequence after another [...] It doesn't linger on the special effects (some of the sharks look like cartoons), but it knows how to use timing, suspense, quick movement and [...] surprise". He concluded that the film keeps spectators guessing in an otherwise predictable genre. In a positive review, Kenneth Turan of Los Angeles Times considered Deep Blue Sea a return to form for Harlin, especially after the [...] "dismal swamps" [...] of Cutthroat Island and The Long Kiss Goodnight. He described the film as [...] "an example of how expert action filmmaking and up-to-the-minute visual effects can transcend a workmanlike script and bring excitement to conventional genre material". Similarly, Desson Howe of The Washington Post remarked that, while the film's premise feels familiar, it [...] "knows its audience and knows what'll get them going – and even wondering". He said that Deep Blue Sea might not be Harlin's finest two hours, but he managed to build [...] "something that, if nothing else, gives you <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>big</b> shock every few minutes". In a three-and-a-half out of four review, Robert Lasowski of The Florida Times-Union highly praised the film's pacing, intense action, and chase scenes, stating that Deep Blue Sea is [...] "a great popcorn movie" [...] and [...] "what summer at the cineplex is all about".|$|E

In her book Soap Stars, Debbie Foy featured Metcalfe and described Mercedes as [...] "having a dangerous streak and is always causing trouble or has a scam on the go, she enjoys taking risks and usually seems to get what she wants". Virgin Media listed Mercedes' wedding to Russ amongst their list of [...] "Soap's biggest wedding day disasters" [...] before adding that [...] "McQueen weddings are full of drama, and Russ and Mercedes' big day was no exception". Virgin Media later profiled some of Hollyoaks' [...] "hottest females" [...] in their opinion, and stated about Mercedes, [...] "As one of the hottest ladies in Hollyoaks, with curves to die for, Mercedes has had more men than hot dinners. And now Malachy's met his maker, we're sure it won't be long till Mercedes earns yet another notch on her bedpost". The Liverpool Echo described Mercedes' desire to marry saying, [...] "Mercedes has finally got what she's wanted for so long - <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>big</b> gleaming rock on her finger. Not that it matters who gave it to her, of course". Anthony D. Langford from AfterElton praised Mercedes, saying he loved the character and had these affections [...] "Because frankly, she scares the bejeezus out of me. This is one tough chick [...] As hard edged as she is, it's obvious she loves her brother dearly, and heaven help anyone who hurts a member of her family".|$|E
500|$|... "Meat" [...] {{was made}} {{alongside}} [...] "Sleeper", the second {{episode of the}} series which was also directed by Teague, as part of block two of production which ran from 3 June to 5 July 2007. It originally had the working title [...] "Another Working Day". In discussing {{the origins of the}} central alien writer Catherine Tregenna states that [...] "we were just throwing ideas around and true to form Russell [...] said [...] "why isn't it just <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>big</b> whale in a warehouse?"" [...] Davies states the alien was designed to be [...] "one of Torchwood and Doctor Whos biggest monsters" [...] not in terms of concept but its [...] "literal size". He felt this provided insight into [...] "the strangeness of life". Producer Richard Stokes states that the concept design team created an idea of what they envisaged the whale to look like. Tregenna felt that the original design for the creature was [...] "a little fanciful" [...] in that it was a bit too [...] "beautiful and exotic" [...] before deciding [...] "if it looked like that they [...] would exhibit it, it would be a freak show." [...] She characterises the final design as resembling [...] "a giant kebab". Contrary to observations from commentators, Tregenna did not intend the story to promote vegetarianism as she is not a vegetarian— she simply wanted to write an episode that was more action based than her series one episodes ("Out of Time" [...] and [...] "Captain Jack Harkness"). The hypothetical size of the space whale resulted in Teague having to find this [...] "huge great warehouse" [...] and hire a fifty-foot crane for camera angles. Whilst {{the main body of the}} alien was created using computer-generated imagery a prosthetic version of the cut wound in the side of the alien was available for the actors to interact with on set. Actor Eve Myles describes it as being like filming within a [...] "blood soaked, soppy big sponge". The opening of the creature's eye was created using green screen. Owen felt having to react to this to be the most unusual acting experience he'd had whilst filming Torchwood.|$|E
