25|$|He {{first became}} a cadet in the State of Perak. During his twenty years there {{and on the}} east coast of the Malay Peninsula in Pahang, Clifford socialised with the local Malays and studied their {{language}} and culture deeply. He came to sympathise strongly with <b>and</b> <b>admire</b> certain aspects of the traditional indigenous cultures, while recognising that their transformation {{as a consequence of the}} colonial project which he served was inevitable. He served as British Resident at Pahang, 1896–1900 and 1901–1903, and Governor of North Borneo, 1900–1901.|$|E
25|$|The Church {{had been}} {{practically}} abandoned {{for some years}} and was in a bad state of delapidation, but the beautiful carved work {{that had been done}} by William Bernard Sears, soon after the church was built, had not then been molested. My mother used to sit in the church and read the Lord's Prayer and Ten Commandments over the Chancel, <b>and</b> <b>admire</b> the gilded dove that Mr. Sears had placed high over the Pulpit.

25|$|Although some Big Sur {{residents}} {{catered to}} adventurous travelers {{in the early}} twentieth century, the modern tourist economy began when Highway 1 opened the region to automobiles in 1937, but only took off after World War II-era gasoline rationing ended in the mid-1940s. In 1978, about 1.5 million visitors are estimated to have visited the Big Sur Coast. In 1980, that number had grown to about 3 million visitors a year. Most of the 3 to 4 million tourists who currently visit Big Sur each year never leave Highway 1, because the adjacent Santa Lucia Range {{is one of the largest}} roadless areas near a coast in the contiguous United States. The highway winds along the western flank of the mountains mostly within sight of the Pacific Ocean, varying from near sea level up to a thousand-foot sheer drop to the water. The highway includes a large number of vista points allowing motorists to stop <b>and</b> <b>admire</b> the landscape.|$|E
25|$|The Norman Hauteville family, {{who were}} {{descendants}} of Vikings, came to appreciate <b>and</b> <b>admire</b> {{the rich and}} layered culture in which they now found themselves. And they began implementing their own culture, customs, and politics in the region. Many Normans in Sicily also adopted some of the attributes of Muslim rulers and their Byzantine subjects in dress, language, literature, {{and even in the}} presence of palace eunuchs and, according to some accounts, a harem. The court of Roger II became the most luminous centre of culture in the Mediterranean, both from Europe and the Middle East, like the multi-ethnic Caliphate of Córdoba, then only just eclipsed. This attracted scholars, scientists, poets, artists, and artisans of all kinds. Laws were issued {{in the language of the}} community to whom they were addressed in Norman Sicily, still with heavy Arab and Greek influence. The governance was by the rule of law, so there was justice. Muslims, Jews, Byzantine Greeks, Lombards, and Normans worked together to form a society that historians have said created some of the most extraordinary buildings that the world has ever seen.|$|E
25|$|From the carpark {{at the end}} of Glenesk Road, {{directions}} {{are clearly}} signposted. A well formed loop track, used by around 30,000 people a year (2005), follows the Glen Esk Stream with minor undulations (on the south side) up to a lookout where you find a huge Macrocarpa bench seat to rest on <b>and</b> <b>admire</b> the view. The bench seat was made by offenders doing community work (2005). The track then descends down wooden steps {{to the base of the}} falls (40 minutes from the carpark). The track then crosses the stream next to the lower swimming hole and returns down the north side. However, instead of going down again, a walker can climb a reasonably steep track (the Connect Track) which begins about 100m from the base of the falls on the northern side of the stream. It takes about 15 minutes to get to the top of the falls. There is a good swimming hole at the top although the water is cool. From this high vantage point there are great views down the valley.|$|E

500|$|Adolf Hitler {{is said to}} {{have called}} her [...] "the most {{dangerous}} woman in Europe" [...] because he viewed her popularity as a threat to German interests. However, before the war both she and her husband, like most of Parliament and the British public, had supported appeasement and Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, believing after the experience of the First World War that war had to be avoided at all costs. After the resignation of Chamberlain, the King asked Winston Churchill to form a government. Although the King was initially suspicious of Churchill's character and motives, in due course both the King and Queen came to respect <b>and</b> <b>admire</b> him.|$|E
500|$|Even so, Chivers {{continued}} to praise <b>and</b> <b>admire</b> Poe (albeit careful {{to point out}} Poe's literary debt to him) {{and was one of}} the first to present a picture of the [...] "real Poe" [...] in the face of the sustained attacks on Poe's reputation by the Reverend Rufus Wilmot Griswold, the poet's literary executor. This correction took the form of a memoir now titled Chivers' Life of Poe, not published until 1952. Chivers said of Griswold that he [...] "is not only incompetent to Edit any of [...] works, but totally unconscious of the duties which he and every man who sets himself up as a Literary Executor, owe the dead." [...] Chivers {{continued to}} defend Poe's reputation until the end of his life.|$|E
500|$|In March 2013, Boycott and {{his partner}} Rachel Swinglehurst {{purchased}} the Grade II listed Boston Hall in Boston Spa, West Yorkshire, citing {{a desire to be}} closer to family, friends, and Yorkshire County Cricket Club. They later married, and have a daughter. Later in 2014 he released a book entitled Geoffrey Boycott: The Corridor of Certainty with Simon & Schuster. ESPNcricinfo reviewed the piece in October, commenting on Boycott's more amiable personality since his recovery from cancer: [...] "we have a much more rounded and nuanced book, full of self-awareness and a willingness, even eagerness, to acknowledge errors, failings and regrets... This a complex, driven man, whom we all recognise <b>and</b> <b>admire</b> for his achievements, revealing aspects of his life and survival that have hitherto been kept close to his chest." ...|$|E

500|$|Canada {{entered the}} final facing {{pressure}} {{to defeat the}} Soviets. [...] The Soviet national team's easy victory over the National Hockey League's all-stars in the 1979 Challenge Cup left the Canadians searching to regain command of their rivalry with the Soviets. [...] Coach Scotty Bowman called it a [...] "must win game" [...] for Canada: [...] "We really are favorites in the final. [...] Nobody in this country will tolerate a loss." [...] The players also spoke of their desire to show the Soviets {{that they were the}} world's top hockey nation. During their pre-game preparations, Tikhonov called upon his team to play the finest games of their lives: [...] "Today you got to play so well that the entire Canadian population will talk about you afterwards and remember you for a long time. [...] Play so well that the Canadian fans when they will leave Forum will wait for you when you get on the bus after the game <b>and</b> <b>admire</b> you." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} Forest Service in 1928, Marshall worked to {{complete}} his studies for a PhD in plant physiology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. The following year {{he made his first}} trip to Alaska, visiting the upper Koyukuk River and the central Brooks Range, and preparing for an extended stay for study. [...] The scientific objective of the trip was to study tree growth at the northern timberline near the Arctic Divide. For his 15-month sojourn {{in the small town of}} Wiseman, Alaska, Marshall rented a one-room cabin next to the only roadhouse in the village. He furnished it with books, records, a phonograph player, and a writing desk. [...] He placed the desk so that he could sit by the cabin's single window <b>and</b> <b>admire</b> the view of the Koyukuk River and the range of steep, snow-covered mountains in the background. [...] His travels engendered in him a great love for the central Brooks Range in the Alaskan wilderness. [...] Marshall was one of the first to explore much of the range, especially the headwaters of the North fork of the Koyukuk River, where he bestowed the name [...] "Gates of the Arctic" [...] on a pair of mountains, Boreal Mtn. (6,375ft) and Frigid Crags (5,501ft.).|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] segment Weiss spoke about Arya's story, saying [...] "Arya is in danger, she's got an open wound in her stomach, and the one person who has protected her to this point unfortunately gets murdered. The fact that the Many-Faced God gets {{the people who have been}} promised to him really makes you think that there's almost an inevitability about what happens to people who run afoul of the Faceless Men, as Arya has done." [...] Weiss continued about the final part of the sequence, [...] "Arya's telling Jaqen by putting the face on the wall that 'this account is settled, and we're good here, and now I'm going to walk away,' and I think she knows what the answer's going to be. The implication, obviously, is that Jaqen was, on some level, rooting for the outcome that he got. He may be [...] "no one," [...] but there's still enough of a person left in him to respect, <b>and</b> <b>admire</b> who this girl is and what she's become. Arya finally tells us something that we've kind of known all along, that she's not no one, she's Arya Stark of Winterfell." ...|$|E

500|$|One of {{the themes}} that dominates {{the latter part of}} Blair's time in office is his {{decision}} to join US President George W. Bush in committing troops to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the aftermath of which he describes as a [...] "nightmare", but that he believes to have been necessary because Saddam Hussein [...] "had not abandoned the strategy of WMD , merely made a tactical decision to put it into abeyance". He would make the same decision again with regard to Iran, warning that if that country develops nuclear weapons it will change the balance of power of the Middle East, to the region's detriment. Blair believes some problems in Iraq still require a [...] "resolution" [...] and will fester if left unattended. Of the war dead he says, [...] "I feel desperately sorry for them, sorry for the lives cut short, sorry for the families whose bereavement is made worse by the controversy over why their loved ones died, sorry for the utterly unfair selection that the loss should be theirs." [...] A year on from the invasion he hopes Bush will win a second term as US President: [...] "I had come to like <b>and</b> <b>admire</b> George," [...] he writes.|$|E
