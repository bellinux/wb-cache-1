5|$|When Leslie leaves Ron {{with his}} {{favorite}} movies for his surprise birthday party, {{one of them}} is The Bridge on the River Kwai, a 1958 film about British World War II prisoners forced to build a bridge in Thailand. The scene Ron watches on television is an actual scene from that film. The other film Leslie gives Ron is The Dirty Dozen, a 1967 war film about a team of convicted murderers being trained for mission to assassinate German officers, also during World War II. Leslie only finds out Ron's birthday, which was a closely guarded secret, by bribing an employee from Baskin-Robbins, an ice cream parlor chain that gives free scoops of ice cream to customers on their birthdays. Eagleton is such a rich town that, after their town meeting, they distribute gift bags that include <b>an</b> <b>iPod</b> Touch, a portable music player by Apple, Inc. Lindsay Carlisle Shay also drives a Cadillac Escalade, an expensive luxury sport utility vehicle brand by Cadillac. During another scene, Ron declares that birthdays were made up by Hallmark, a greeting cards company, to sell more cards.|$|E
25|$|During installation, <b>an</b> <b>iPod</b> is {{associated}} with one host computer. Each time <b>an</b> <b>iPod</b> connects to its host computer, iTunes can synchronize entire music libraries or music playlists either automatically or manually. Song ratings can be set on <b>an</b> <b>iPod</b> and synchronized later to the iTunes library, and vice versa. A user can access, play, and add music on a second computer if <b>an</b> <b>iPod</b> is set to manual and not automatic sync, but anything added or edited will be reversed upon connecting and syncing with the main computer and its library. If a user wishes to automatically sync music with another computer, an iPod's library will be entirely wiped and replaced with the other computer's library.|$|E
25|$|From version 5.2 onwards, {{support for}} {{synchronizing}} with <b>an</b> <b>iPod</b> is built-in.|$|E

25|$|Media {{files are}} stored on <b>an</b> <b>iPod</b> in a hidden folder, {{along with a}} {{proprietary}} database file.

Many third-party applications also allow easy copying of media files off of <b>an</b> <b>iPod.</b>|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{many other}} MP3 players, simply copying audio or video files to the drive with a typical file {{management}} application {{will not allow}} <b>an</b> <b>iPod</b> to properly access them. The user must use software that has been specifically designed to transfer media files to iPods, so that the files are playable and viewable. Usually iTunes is used to transfer media to <b>an</b> <b>iPod,</b> though several alternative third-party applications are available {{on a number of}} different platforms.|$|E
