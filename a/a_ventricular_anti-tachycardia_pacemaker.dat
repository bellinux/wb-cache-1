40|$|Abstract Background Hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (HCM) is {{an extremely}} heterogeneous disease. An under recognized and very often missed subgroup within this broad spectrum concerns patients with left ventricular (LV) apical aneurysms {{in the absence of}} coronary artery disease. Case presentation We describe a case of HCM with midventricular obstruction and apical aneurysm formation in 3 patients coming from a single family. This HCM pattern was detected by 2 D-echocardiography and confirmed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. A cardioverter defibrillator was implanted in one of the patients because of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia detected in 24 -h Holter monitoring and an abrupt drop in systolic blood pressure during maximal exercise test. The defibrillator activated 8 months after implantation by suppression of <b>a</b> <b>ventricular</b> tachycardia providing <b>anti-tachycardia</b> pacing. The patient died due to refractory heart failure 2 years after initial evaluation. The rest of the patients are stable after a 2. 5 -y follow-up period. Conclusion The detection of apical aneurysm by echocardiography in HCM patients may be complicated. Ventricular tachycardia arising from the scarred aneurysm wall may often occur predisposing to sudden death. </p...|$|R
40|$|Dr. Levine's {{comments}} 1 {{are greatly}} appreciated. Most modern ICDs have arrhythmia discrimination algorithms that have variable success in withholding inappropriate therapy. It must be borne {{in mind that}} enhancing specificity for ventricular arrhythmia detection can entail a loss of sensitivity. Accordingly, all algorithms necessarily {{err on the side}} of safety and will withhold therapy for only brief period of time. A persistent high rate will eventually be treated as <b>a</b> <b>ventricular</b> arrhythmia and can result in unnecessary and repetetive shocks. Hence the importance of aggressive management of supraventricular arrhythmias in these patients cannot be overemphasized. The patient presented in the case study 2 had an older generation single chamber ICD. Although, the provocation of <b>ventricular</b> tachycardia by <b>anti-tachycardia</b> pacing led to an ICD shock and termination of the atrial arrhythmia in this particular instance, atrial arrhythmias are often not terminated by ICD shocks delivered between an RV lead and the generator can. Further therapies with repeated induction of VT could have resulted. In patients with severe LV dysfunction or ischemia, such arrhythmias have a potential for progression to intractable ventricular fibrillation and death...|$|R

40|$|Ninety-six {{patients}} with an atrioventricular septal defect were assessed by two dimensional echocardiography. Forty-eight patients were judged as having two discrete valve orifices.

40|$|ObjectivesCross-sectional {{studies of}} intermediate-term {{survivors}} of infant cardiac surgery have revealed a high frequency of neurodevelopmental disabilities. Few data exist regarding neurodevelopmental outcome of infants undergoing surgical intervention for <b>a</b> <b>ventricular</b> septal defect. The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the neurodevelopmental outcome at 1 year of age of children who had surgical repair in infancy of <b>a</b> <b>ventricular</b> septal defect or <b>a</b> <b>ventricular</b> septal defect with aortic arch obstruction. MethodsChildren who underwent repair of <b>a</b> <b>ventricular</b> septal defect or single-stage repair of <b>a</b> <b>ventricular</b> septal defect with aortic arch obstruction at less than 6 months of age were assessed at 1 year of age by using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II, which yields the Mental Development Index and the Psychomotor Development Index, both with an expected mean of 100 ± 15. ResultsAt 1 year, 55 patients (ventricular septal defect alone = 36; ventricular septal defect with aortic arch obstruction = 19) returned for evaluation. The mean Mental Development Index was 92. 6 ± 11. 7, with 3 (5 %) patients scoring 70 or less. The mean Psychomotor Development Index was 86. 1 ± 16. 4, with 10 (18 %) patients scoring 70 or less. Patients with a suspected or confirmed genetic syndrome had both a lower Mental Development Index score (P =. 011) and a lower Psychomotor Development Index score (P =. 001). Mental Development Index and Psychomotor Development Index were independent of anatomic (specifically aortic arch obstruction) and intraoperative factors (specifically deep hypothermic circulatory arrest). ConclusionsNeurodevelopmental outcome at 1 year of age was within the normal limits for most patients who underwent repair of <b>a</b> <b>ventricular</b> septal defect or <b>a</b> <b>ventricular</b> septal defect with aortic arch obstruction during infancy...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: This study {{analyzes}} {{the results of}} the arterial switch operation for transposition of the great arteries in member institutions of the European Congenital Heart Surgeons Association. Methods: The records of 613 patients who underwent primary arterial switch operations in each of 19 participating institutions in the period from January 1998 through December 2000 were reviewed retrospectively. Results: <b>A</b> <b>ventricular</b> septal defect was present in 186 (30 %) patients. Coronary anatomy was type A in 69 % of the patients, and aortic arch pathology was present in 20 % of patients with ventricular septal defect. Rashkind septostomy was performed in 75 % of the patients, and 69 % received prostaglandin. There were 37 hospital deaths (operative mortality, 6 %), 13 (3 %) for patients with <b>an</b> intact <b>ventricular</b> septum and 24 (13 %) for those with <b>a</b> <b>ventricular</b> septal defect (P <. 001). In 36 % delayed sternal closure was performed, 8 % required peritoneal dialysis, and 2 % required mechanical circulatory support. Median ventilation time was 58 hours, and intensive care and hospital stay were 6 and 14 days, respectively. Although of various preoperative risk factors the presence of <b>a</b> <b>ventricular</b> septal defect, arch pathology, and coronary anomalies were univariate predictors of operative mortality, only the presence of <b>a</b> <b>ventricular</b> septal defect approached statistical significance (P =. 06) on multivariable analysis. Of various operative parameters, aortic crossclamp time and delayed sternal closure were also univariate predictors; however, only the latter was an independent statistically significant predictor of death. Conclusions: Results of the procedure in European centers are compatible with those in the literature. The presence of <b>a</b> <b>ventricular</b> septal defect is the clinically most important preoperative risk factor for operative death, approaching statistical significance on multivariable analysis...|$|R
