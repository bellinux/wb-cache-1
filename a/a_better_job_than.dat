25|$|After the 1964 season, Chuck Fairbanks, an {{assistant}} coach at Houston, was offered a job at Tennessee. He wanted to accept, {{but it was the}} middle of the summer and unusually late for a coaching move, so he decided to stay loyal to Houston and remained there. After the next season, he was offered a position as {{an assistant}} on Mackenzie's staff at Oklahoma, a position he felt was <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> <b>than</b> the Tennessee position. Immediately after the 1965 season, Fairbanks was offered a job at Missouri with the promise that he would be the head coach within four years. He declined and stayed at Oklahoma. Four months later, Coach Mackenzie died and Fairbanks was named head coach. It did not take long for Fairbanks to turn the team around. In his first season in 1967, his squad went 10–1. They entered their sixth game with a 5–1 record (their only loss was a two-point loss to rival Texas) and unranked and beat ninth ranked Colorado, 23–0. This propelled Fairbanks's team to a number eight ranking. They continued their romp through the season and beat #2 Tennessee 26–24 in the Orange Bowl. They finished the season ranked number three in the country.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the review}} {{aggregator}} Metacritic, the film {{had an average}} score of 25 out of 100, based on 32 reviews from professional critics. At Rotten Tomatoes, 22% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 122 reviews. The film earned generally negative reviews from movie critics, although some praised Lopez's performance. Stephen Holden of The New York Times said Lopez [...] "holds the screen in a star performance that {{has less to do}} with acting than with embodying a forceful, streetwise woman who stands up for herself", while commenting that its preview had [...] "audience gasping" [...] and [...] "Enough does <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> <b>than</b> most movies of sustaining a mood of palpable physical menace, then confirming your worst fears". On the other hand, Alice King of Entertainment Weekly described the film's plot as [...] "arduously nonsensical" [...] and felt that Lopez lacked connection with her on-screen daughter Tessa Allen, commenting that: [...] "All this to protect a helium-voiced little girl with whom Lopez has so little chemistry, it's as if she's handling garbage rather than a small child." [...] A writer from Contactmusic.com was underwhelmed with the development of the film, noting that the film doesn't [...] "utilize Slim's old friend and romantic interest enough, nor does it develop Slim's real and adopted fathers" [...] while it [...] "uses the tiresome old [...] "kid" [...] cliché. Gracie is, as always, just old enough to understand the situation, but not quite old enough to make an actual impact in the story." [...] However, the writer did praise Lopez in the end sequence, [...] "By the final scenes, despite their obviousness, I was as engrossed in the movie as I could have been, actually rooting for J. Lo to kick some bad guy butt". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote: [...] "Lopez has an image of being sexy and tough, but her appeal as an actress is that she's down to earth and that her emotions are accessible. There's nothing cold about her." [...] Additionally, LaSalle felt that [...] "It's the most tension-producing movie out there right now", stating that [...] "it has the biggest visceral kick, capable of inspiring blood lust in otherwise peaceful viewers.|$|E
2500|$|DeSimone's second underboss Nick [...] "Old Man" [...] Licata succeeded him. Licata {{had strong}} ties with Mafia {{families}} in the Midwest and South and maintained contact with the mob in Las Vegas. By then, law enforcement knew much about mob activities in Los Angeles, which was helped by top hitman Frank Bompensiero becoming an undercover informant in 1967. In 1963 Joe Valachi ousted the Mafia as a secret criminal society, aiding in law enforcements attacks on organized crime and fingered Licata as a high ranking mobster in Los Angeles. A bright spot during the period was that Louis Tom Dragna's company [...] "Roberta Dress Manufacturing" [...] was turning into a $10 million a year business. This was possible because in the 1950s, Jack Dragna flew labor union expert Johnny Dio in from New York City to teach Louis how to manipulate labor unions in the Los Angeles Garment District. Licata had high hopes of restoring the declining family, but with the police and FBI constantly monitoring his family, Licata wasn't able to do much of <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> <b>than</b> DeSimone. On July 9, 1969 Licata {{was taken into custody}} after refusing to answer questions at a federal grand jury session about L.A.'s crime syndicate structure. He was held in contempt of court for refusing to testify after being given immunity from prosecution and eventually served six months in prison. A pair of indictments in the mid-1970s threaten to put most of the working family in prison. In March 1973, seven men were arrested for running a rigged gambling operation in Los Angeles that brought in up to $250,000 a month. Their trial was delayed when the key informant and witness, former Mafia associate John Dubcek, was shot and killed in Las Vegas. Although this scared other informants from testifying, they still were convicted and given light sentences. Four months later another 12 men, were indicted for conspiracy, racketeering and extortion against bookmakers, loan sharks, and pornographers. Licata's underboss Joseph Dippolito had a large influence in San Bernardino and the Inland Empire in both legitimate and criminal enterprises. He was seen as Licata's successor, but died unexpectedly {{of a heart attack in}} January 1974 at the age of 59. On October 19, 1974, after a long battle with illnesses, Nick Licata died at age 77.|$|E
