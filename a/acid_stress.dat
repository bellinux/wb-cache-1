We used DNA microarray analysis to identify genes that were upregulated by <b>acid</b> <b>stress</b> in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Several of these genes may be response regulators that are directly involved {{in this type of}} stress response. We constructed deletion mutants for the response regulator genes and compared the growth rates of cells transfected with mutant and wild-type genes in a low pH medium. Of these mutants, deletion of sphR affected the growth rate under <b>acid</b> <b>stress</b> (pH 6. 0) conditions. We examined genome-wide expression in ΔsphR mutant cells using DNA microarray to determine whether SphR was involved in the regulation of other <b>acid</b> <b>stress</b> responsive genes. Microarray and real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses of wild-type cells showed that the expression of phoA, pstS 1, and pstS 2, which are upregulated under phosphate-limiting conditions, increased (2. 48 -, 1. 88 -, and 5. 07 -fold, respectively) after <b>acid</b> <b>stress</b> treatment for 0. 5 h. In contrast, pstS 2 expression did not increase in the ΔsphR mutant cells after <b>acid</b> <b>stress,</b> whereas the phoA and sphX mRNA levels increased.

In this study, hfq was highly expressed when S. flexneri was exposed to low pH. Growth retardation was observed in the hfq deletion mutant at pH values ranging from 5. 0 to 7. 0 and the survival rate of the mutant strain was reduced by 60 % in acidic conditions (pH 3. 0) compared with the wild-type strain. Additionally, competitive invasion assays in HeLa cells and lung invasion assays showed that the virulence of the hfq deletion mutant was significantly decreased. An evaluation of the mechanism revealed that, along with the expression of the Type III secretion system genes, acid resistance genes were also increased with <b>acid</b> <b>stress.</b> Interestingly, a statistically strong linear correlation was observed between the expression of hfq and Type III secretion system genes, as well as between hfq and acid resistance genes, under various pH conditions.

The novel application of the program XCMS to the solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS) data allowed accurate separation and quantification of 2 -methylbutanoic and 3 -methylbutanoic acids, generally reported as a cumulative datum.

40|$|International audienceThe {{evolutionary}} history of plants is tightly {{connected with the}} evolution of microbial pathogens and herbivores, which use photosynthetic end products {{as a source of}} life. In these interactions, plants, as the stationary party, have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to sense, signal and respond to the presence of external stress agents. Chloroplasts are metabolically versatile organelles that carry out fundamental functions in determining appropriate immune reactions in plants. Besides photosynthesis, chloroplasts host key steps in the biosynthesis of amino <b>acids,</b> <b>stress</b> hormones and secondary metabolites, which have a great impact on resistance against pathogens and insect herbivores. Changes in chloroplast redox signalling pathways and reactive oxygen species metabolism also mediate local and systemic signals, which modulate plant resistance to light stress and disease. Moreover, interplay among chloroplastic signalling networks and plasma membrane receptor kinases is emerging as a key mechanism that modulates stress responses in plants. This review highlights the central role of chloroplasts in the signalling crosstalk that essentially determines the outcome of plant-pathogen interactions in plants...|$|R

The relationship between structure and activity is discussed. The results seem to conform well with physico-chemical hypothesis of Veldstra. Besides, however, {{an important role}} of charge-transfer force in the fixation. of the growth substance {{at the site of}} action is suggested. In the last two decades, it has been found that various types of synthetic-compounds exhibit the plant growth activity which resembles that of native growth substance, indole- 3 -acetic acid, and many workers have attempted to gain an insight into the mode of action on the basis of analysis of the rela-tionship between structure and activity of these compounds 1 - 4). In this laboratory, since 1944, a series of studies`-"'"a) has been carried out. on the activity of a new type of synthetic growth substances, viz. 1 -naphthoic. acid, 1, 4 -, 1, 2 -, 3, 4 -dihydro- and 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydro- 1 -naphthoic <b>acids,</b> <b>stressing...</b>|$|R
