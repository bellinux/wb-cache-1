5|$|In {{the sixteenth}} century, Scottish kings, {{particularly}} James V, built palaces in a Renaissance style, beginning at Linlithgow. The trend soon spread {{to members of}} the aristocracy. Painting was strongly influenced by Flemish art, with works commissioned from the continent and Flemings serving as court artists. While church art suffered iconoclasm and a loss of patronage {{as a result of the}} Reformation, house decoration and portraiture became significant for the wealthy, with George Jamesone emerging as the first major named artist in the early seventeenth century. Music also incorporated wider European influences although the Reformation caused a move from complex polyphonic church music to the simpler singing of metrical psalms. Combined with the Union of Crowns in 1603, the Reformation also removed the church and the court as sources of patronage, changing the direction of <b>artistic</b> <b>creation</b> and limiting its scope. In the early seventeenth century the major elements of the Renaissance began to give way to Stoicism, Mannerism and the Baroque.|$|E

25|$|French artists {{developed}} the rococo {{style in the}} 18th century, as a more intimate imitation of old baroque style, {{the works of the}} court-endorsed artists Antoine Watteau, François Boucher and Jean-Honoré Fragonard being the most representative in the country. The French Revolution brought great changes, as Napoleon favoured artists of neoclassic style such as Jacques-Louis David and the highly influential Académie des Beaux-Arts defined the style known as Academism. At this time France had become a centre of <b>artistic</b> <b>creation,</b> {{the first half of the}} 19th century being dominated by two successive movements, at first Romanticism with Théodore Géricault and Eugène Delacroix, and Realism with Camille Corot, Gustave Courbet and Jean-François Millet, a style that eventually evolved into Naturalism.|$|E
25|$|The {{objective}} is also cultural. The movement aims {{to bring a}} new look on Syria by focusing on its cultural diversity and richness, beyond ubiquitous images of despair. According to Leila Shahid for La Marseilleise, Syria is a great cultural nation, a pluricultural leader of <b>artistic</b> <b>creation.</b> Journalist Alain Laurens commented that the Syrian cultural caravan’s involvement makes the public forget during the performance about all the bombings in Aleppo and Damascus and {{make room for a}} humane and fraternal communion. It is a way of showing that the Syrian cultural scene and its artists is alive and thriving. Finally, the road trip allows the Cultural Caravan to make art and culture come to the people, therefore going upstream of artistic and cultural centralisation. Most of the time, the exhibition is set up outside, making it accessible to a greater number.|$|E
25|$|Paris {{was a world}} {{center of}} the arts but the fierce {{competition}} between artists proved too much for Nadir Afonso. In 1965, conscious of his social inadaptation, he moved back to his hometown of Chaves and gradually took refuge in isolation and accentuated the orientation of his life towards the creation of art. He terminated the architecture practice and pursued his aesthetics studies based on geometry, which he considered the essence of art. Once in a while, he left his hideout to return to Paris and meet with friends, author Roger Garaudy, painter Victor Vasarely, and critic Michel Gaüzes. By indication of Garaudy, he traveled to Toulouse to meet aestheticist Pierre Bru, with whom he reviewed the syntactic form of his studies, before publishing Les Mécanismes de la Création Artistique (The Mechanisms of <b>Artistic</b> <b>Creation),</b> the book where he introduced his original theory of art as an exact science.|$|E
