On December 21, 2016, the California Department of Motor Vehicles revoked the registration of the 16 vehicles Uber was using {{for the test}} and forced the program to cease operations in California. Uber then moved the program to Arizona, where the cars <b>are</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> passengers, albeit with 2 Uber engineers in the front seats as a safety precaution. In March 2017, an Uber self-driving car was flipped on its side by a vehicle which failed to yield.|$|E
500|$|In 2005 {{there was}} {{a tidal wave of}} new wizard rock bands. The {{brothers}} do-it-yourself musical ethos has caught on with bands forming as fellow Potter fans <b>are</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> instruments for the first time. Like Harry and the Potters, these new bands also take on the persona, or dress as a Harry Potter-themed character. Though most fans of the music are previous fans of Harry Potter, some bands have attracted listeners outside of the Harry Potter fanbase. Paul and Joe are aware of around 200 other Harry Potter-related rock bands who at least record and post songs on the Internet. The Boston Phoenix wondered—in spite of fully booked calendars—how long wizard rock would last once there are no new stories to riff on, as their musical identity is contingent on the lasting success and popularity of a book series. [...] "In some ways," [...] said Paul, [...] "we want to tie things off and consider it a done deal. We’ve always viewed this as a project that had a finite life and end point." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{opens with}} Leslie (Amy Poehler) and Tom (Aziz Ansari) {{responding}} to an incident at a park trail, where teenage boys <b>are</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> plastic baggies of dog droppings and throwing them at each other. [...] Leslie tries {{to stop them}} but ends up playing along with the boys and admitting that it is fun. [...] Later, at the Pawnee town hall, a construction company has sent a gift basket with wine and cheese to the parks department, but Leslie locks it away {{because they are not}} allowed to accept gifts over $25. [...] Later, she and the others in the department look at a new social-networking site that April (Aubrey Plaza) has set up for the pit construction project. [...] The site already has seven friends, including city planner Mark (Paul Schneider), who Leslie is disappointed to see is friends with many scantily clad young women. [...] Leslie and Ann (Rashida Jones) see Mark and other city planners drinking beer in the town hall courtyard. [...] Leslie describes it as the exclusive [...] "boys' club" [...] and proposes that she and Ann crash it.|$|E

500|$|A {{few months}} later Kunal and Sam meet in court, where they <b>are</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> {{residency}} permits. Recognising {{the value of their}} friendship with Neha and each other, they reconcile. They find Neha at a fashion show and try to apologise, but she refuses to see them. Unaware of [...] Neha and Abhi's break-up, they ask about the wedding and Neha tells them about Veer's fears. Kunal and Sam admit that they manipulated the boy, angering Neha and Abhi. Kunal and Sam climb onto the stage and beg Neha's forgiveness. The crowd encourages them to beg on their knees, say that they love her and blow her kisses, but nothing softens her. When the crowd tells them to kiss each other, they refuse. Neha and Abhi turn to leave, and Kunal kisses a reluctant Sam. Abhi and Neha are both amazed by the lengths to which they will go to regain her trust; Neha forgives them. Kunal and Sam then get down on their knees and propose to Abhi on her behalf. Amused, Abhi agrees. Two months later, Neha playfully asks Kunal and Sam if they felt anything for each other when they pretended to be gay; they say [...] "no", remembering their kiss.|$|E

2500|$|Helen Vendler {{sees the}} {{conflict}} that both Booth and Lopez <b>are</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> on, but also adds {{the idea of}} the different concepts of time that Shakespeare develops. The waves upon the shore, beating endlessly as the minutes beat upon the hours, is the stationary model, showing the consistency and terminality of the speaker's enemy. She also describes a model of rise and fall, characterizing the tragic model. [...] Similar to the shape of a human lifespan, with a rise from immaturity and incompetence, climaxing at a stage most able, and then steadily falling away from the high point of life and towards entropy, the second quatrain shows this parabolic idea of existence, from which Shakespeare longs to escape. The third quatrain gives Vendler the specific images that Booth and Lopez refer to the violent encounter between the speaker and time, and how time speedily spoils all the speaker enjoys. While Booth and Lopez see the conflict Shakespeare is ensnared by as one of the main points to take away from this sonnet, Vendler examines the confusion of these models interacting with each other, suggesting an inner conflict as more pressing than his external conflict about time and its destructive and unwanted powers.|$|E
