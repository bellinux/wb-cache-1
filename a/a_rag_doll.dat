5|$|In Oregon, {{two teenage}} boys (Gary and Richie) are {{exploring}} {{the crash site}} when they encounter Deputy Miles, who denies any crash or the fire that {{was reported in the}} area. While they go through the area on their own, Gary is lifted off the ground and shaken like <b>a</b> <b>rag</b> <b>doll</b> by an invisible force, and Richie, although he stands within a few feet of him, can't see him. Meanwhile, in Washington, Fox Mulder receives a call from Billy Miles, an abductee from Bellefleur whom the agents investigated seven years prior. The younger Miles tells him about Hoese's disappearance, and his concern that the abductions have begun again.|$|E
500|$|... 1926 – [...] "Someone to Watch Over Me" [...] {{is a show}} tune {{from the}} Broadway musical Oh, Kay!, {{composed}} by George Gershwin with lyrics by Ira Gershwin. Gertrude Lawrence introduced the song on stage, singing it to <b>a</b> <b>rag</b> <b>doll.</b> Lawrence also made the first hit recording of the song in 1927. Lyricist Howard Dietz claims to {{have come up with}} the song's name and helped with the lyrics, but received no official credit. The song's jazz popularity was established in the mid-1940s by the recordings of Billy Butterfield, Eddie Condon, Coleman Hawkins and Ike Quebec.|$|E

2500|$|In 2002, the {{popularity}} of antihero Todd Manning (Roger Howarth) prompted ABC to market <b>a</b> <b>rag</b> <b>doll</b> of the character, complete with his signature scar. First offered for sale on April 29, 2002, the doll was pulled on May 7, 2002, after a backlash begun when The Jack Myers Report [...] "harshly criticized the network's judgment" [...] on creating and releasing a doll based on Manning, a character who had notably been convicted of rape in 1993. The New York Times later quoted then-ABC President Angela Shapiro stating, [...] "I was insensitive and take total responsibility for it. I should have been sensitive {{to the history of}} the character and I wasn't." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly after, Orton and Orbit began experimenting to pull an LP together. [...] "Don't Wanna Know 'Bout Evil" [...] was {{the first}} track on the album Superpinkymandy, named after <b>a</b> <b>rag</b> <b>doll</b> which she bought at a jumble sale {{at the age of}} six. This rare album was {{released}} in Japan alone, in extremely limited numbers (popularly quoted as between 1000 and 5000 copies pressed). The sound is very much Orbit's, but all songs (except [...] "Don't Wanna Know 'Bout Evil") were written by both Orton and Orbit, and some tracks were later recycled, in very different versions. [...] "She Cries Your Name" [...] later appeared on Trailer Park. [...] "Yesterday's Gone" [...] became [...] "Montok Point" [...] on the fourth Strange Cargo release, Hinterland (1995). Hinterland featured Orton's vocals on several tracks, and also included an alternative version of [...] "She Cries Your Name".|$|E
2500|$|When Emily had left, Bagpuss woke up. The {{programme}} {{shifted from}} sepia to colour stop motion film, and various toys {{in the shop}} came to life: Gabriel the toad (who, unlike most Smallfilms characters, could move by a special device beneath his can {{without the use of}} stop motion animation) and <b>a</b> <b>rag</b> <b>doll</b> called Madeleine. The wooden woodpecker bookend became the drily academic Professor Yaffle (based on the philosopher Bertrand Russell, whom Postgate had once met), while the mice carved {{on the side of the}} [...] "mouse organ" [...] (a small mechanical pipe organ that played rolls of music) woke up and scurried around, singing in high-pitched voices. Sandra Kerr and John Faulkner provided the voices of Madeleine and Gabriel respectively, and put together and performed all the folk songs. All the other voices (including the narrator and one out-of-tune mouse) were provided by Postgate, who also wrote the stories.|$|E

2500|$|Bucky owns a {{miniature}} teddy bear named [...] "Smacky", obtained by his refusing to exchange toys with Satchel at a [...] "McDoodles" [...] restaurant even though each had the toy the other wanted. It {{is one of}} the few objects to which he shows affection. As Christmas gifts, Bucky received two other bears which he named [...] "Cracker" [...] and [...] "Punk", but they do not appear as often as Smacky. Bucky also owns <b>a</b> <b>rag</b> <b>doll</b> named [...] "Ms. Pretty", similar to Barbie. Bucky claims to be a fan of the [...] "Yankers", even wearing a Yankees cap throughout the series, although it appears more to be an opportunity to annoy Rob because he wouldn't let him wear his Boston Red Sox baseball cap (he calls it the [...] "'B' is for 'Bucky' hat") than anything else. Bucky has been shown to hold extremely conservative political viewpoints throughout the strip, but these may not stem from actual convictions as much as a desire to antagonize Rob and Satchel, both apparent liberals. Bucky is also frequently shown to have francophobic and anti-Quebec sentiments. He regularly says words like frog and canuck, although these (like his politics and support of the Yankees) appear to stem from the desire to antagonize Satchel for his background, rather than racism or nativism.|$|E

5000|$|... 9 is <b>a</b> sentient <b>rag</b> <b>doll</b> {{who appears}} to be the last of his kind, living in the ruins of a decaying, post-apocalyptic Earth. He is first seen making simple {{constructs}} out of refuse - a swinging armature of scrap metal, an upright book with string tied around it, and <b>a</b> dummy <b>rag</b> <b>doll</b> full of tar, though the purpose behind these things is unclear at first. Hunting 9 relentlessly is the Cat Beast, a mechanical monster wearing a cat's skull for a head. It appears to be guided by a small glowing talisman which it holds in its claws. Sitting quietly, 9 stares into the mirrored surface of his own strange talisman and has a flashback.|$|R
60|$|She had preceded {{him into}} the pantry to help him off with his overcoat. Gabriel smiled at the three syllables she had given his surname and glanced at her. She was a slim, growing girl, pale in {{complexion}} and with hay-coloured hair. The gas in the pantry made her look still paler. Gabriel had known {{her when she was}} a child and used to sit on the lowest step nursing <b>a</b> <b>rag</b> <b>doll.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{carriage}} {{itself was}} {{of the kind that}} are sold in toy shops, and it was drawn by two horses standing upon wooden platforms with rollers underneath, so that instead of the horses themselves running, the wheels of the platforms whirled around, taking the carriage wherever the driver might direct. This driver looked {{for all the world like}} <b>a</b> <b>rag</b> <b>doll</b> dressed in a coachman's uniform. His neck was rather weak, and that caused his head to lean slightly to one side, giving him a somewhat broken-down appearance; but he held the reins firmly in his stuffed hands and looked straight ahead, like a well-trained servant.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Tretherick faced quickly about. Standing in {{the doorway}} {{was a little girl}} of six or seven. Her dress had been {{originally}} fine, but was torn and dirty; and her hair, which was a very violent red, was tumbled serio-comically about her forehead. For all this, she was a picturesque little thing, even through whose childish timidity there was a certain self-sustained air which is apt to come upon children who are left much to themselves. She was holding under her arm <b>a</b> <b>rag</b> <b>doll,</b> apparently of her own workmanship, and nearly as large as herself,--a doll with a cylindrical head, and features roughly indicated with charcoal. A long shawl, evidently belonging to a grown person, dropped from her shoulders, and swept the floor.|$|E
50|$|The term ragdoll {{comes from}} the problem that the {{articulated}} systems, due {{to the limits of}} the solvers used, tend to have little or zero joint/skeletal muscle stiffness, leading to a character collapsing much like <b>a</b> toy <b>rag</b> <b>doll,</b> often into comically improbable or compromising positions.|$|R

60|$|They {{were all}} gone, {{and the little}} house under the ledge was deserted. In one of the tumble-down rooms I found <b>a</b> <b>rag</b> <b>doll</b> beside the cold hearth, and some poor toys on a shelf under a broken window. In the whole lonely {{forgotten}} house these were {{the only things that}} brought the light to one's face and the moisture to his eyes as he beheld them. All else spoke of ruin and decay; but these poor playthings that little hands had touched went straight to the heart with an eternal suggesting of life and innocence and a childhood that never grows old in the world. I dusted them tenderly with my handkerchief and put them back in their places, and went away softly down the path that led to the other house where the Little Brother to the Bear used to live.|$|E
60|$|It {{was partly}} {{to see these}} little herons, the thought of which had fascinated me ever since I had seen Quoskh taking home what I thought, at first glance, was <b>a</b> <b>rag</b> <b>doll</b> for them to play with, and partly {{to find out more}} of Quoskh's hunting habits by seeing what he brought home, that led me at last to {{undertake}} the difficult task of climbing the huge tree to the nest. One day when the mother had brought home some unknown small animal--a mink, I thought--I came suddenly out of my hiding and crossed over to the nest. It had always fascinated me. Under it, at twilight, I had heard the mother heron croaking softly to her little ones--a husky lullaby, but sweet enough to them--and then, as I paddled away, I would see the nest dark against the sunset with Mother Quoskh standing over it, a tall, graceful silhouette against the glory of twilight, keeping sentinel watch over her little ones. Now I would solve the mystery of the high nest by looking into it.|$|E
60|$|Our {{chief at}} Anaho was always called, he always called himself, Taipi-Kikino; {{and yet that}} was not his name, but only the wand of his false position. As {{soon as he was}} {{appointed}} chief, his name-- which signified, if I remember exactly, PRINCE BORN AMONG FLOWERS-- fell in abeyance, and he was dubbed instead by the expressive byword, Taipi-Kikino--HIGHWATER MAN-OF-NO-ACCOUNT--or, Englishing more boldly, BEGGAR ON HORSEBACK--a witty and a wicked cut. A nickname in Polynesia destroys almost the memory of the original name. To-day, if we were Polynesians, Gladstone would be no more heard of. We should speak of and address our Nestor as the Grand Old Man, and it is so that himself would sign his correspondence. Not the prevalence, then, but the significancy of the nickname is to be noted here. The new authority began with small prestige. Taipi has now been some time in office; from all I saw he seemed a person very fit. He is not the least unpopular, and yet his power is nothing. He is a chief to the French, and goes to breakfast with the Resident; but for any practical end of chieftaincy <b>a</b> <b>rag</b> <b>doll</b> were equally efficient.|$|E

6000|$|We played robber now {{and then}} about a month, and then I resigned. All the boys did. We hadn't robbed nobody, hadn't killed any people, but only just pretended. We used to hop {{out of the woods}} and go {{charging}} down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market, but we never hived any of them. Tom Sawyer called the hogs [...] "ingots," [...] and he called the turnips and stuff [...] "julery," [...] and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done, and how many people we had killed and marked. But I couldn't see no profit in it. One time Tom sent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he called a slogan (which was the sign for the Gang to get together), and then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two hundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and over a thousand [...] "sumter" [...] mules, all loaded down with di'monds, and they didn't have only a guard of four hundred soldiers, and so we would lay in ambuscade, as he called it, and kill the lot and scoop the things. He said we must slick up our swords and guns, and get ready. He never could go after even a turnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it, though they was only lath and broomsticks, and you might scour at them till you rotted, and then they warn't worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before. I didn't believe we could lick such a crowd of Spaniards and A-rabs, but I wanted to see the camels and elephants, so I was on hand next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when we got the word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill. But there warn't no Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn't no camels nor no elephants. It warn't anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a primer-class at that. We busted it up, and chased the children up the hollow; but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers got <b>a</b> <b>rag</b> <b>doll,</b> and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and then the teacher charged in, and made us drop everything and cut. I didn't see no di'monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so. He said there was loads of them there, anyway; and he said there was A-rabs there, too, and elephants and things. I said, why couldn't we see them, then? He said if I warn't so ignorant, but had read a book called Don Quixote, I would know without asking. He said it was all done by enchantment. He said there was hundreds of soldiers there, and elephants and treasure, and so on, but we had enemies which he called magicians; and they had turned the whole thing into an infant Sunday-school, just out of spite. I said, all right; then the thing for us to do was to go for the magicians. Tom Sawyer said I was a numskull.|$|E
