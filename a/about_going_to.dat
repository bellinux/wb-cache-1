Deeply hurt by this comment, Bart then began the process of developing his path into the mischievous way of life.|$|E
5|$|David Kaczynski {{had once}} admired and {{emulated}} his older brother, but had later {{decided to leave}} the survivalist lifestyle behind. He had received assurances from the FBI that he would remain anonymous and that his brother would not learn who had turned him in, but his identity was leaked to CBS News in early April 1996. CBS anchorman Dan Rather called FBI director Louis Freeh, who requested 24 hours before CBS broke the story on the evening news. The FBI scrambled to finish the search warrant and have it issued by a federal judge in Montana; afterwards, an internal leak investigation was conducted by the FBI, but the source of the leak was never identified. In 1996 the Evergreen Park Community High School was also placed on lockdown while FBI agents searched Kaczynski's school records. At the end of that school day, students were greeted by reporters asking how they felt <b>about</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the same high school the Unabomber had attended. That night the news story was released to public.|$|E

25|$|As I {{testified to}} the U.S. Senate in 1998, Iraq has the {{indigenous}} capability right now to reconstitute a chemical weapons program {{within a matter of}} weeks. And my concern is if we continue to push for military action against Iraq, and once the writing becomes clear on the wall -- and believe me, if Saddam Hussein doesn't understand that President Bush is dead serious <b>about</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> war against him now, I don't know when he'll be -- when he'll recognize that. But at some point, I believe that Iraq will seek to reconstitute militarized nerve agent that will be used in defense of Baghdad. And I think the Iraqi government's efforts to acquire significant stockpiles of atropine are an indication that this is the direction that Saddam Hussein is heading.|$|E

[...] "Broken-Hearted Girl" [...] was initially intended as the sixth US and fourth international single alongside the stateside-only single [...] "Ego" [...] (2009). However, its release was scrapped at the last minute, and replaced by [...] "Sweet Dreams", which Knowles selected for a summer single release because she wanted an uptempo song that would keep people dancing. She added, [...] "It's very rare to find an uptempo song that means something ... that's not just <b>about</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> a club or partying or being a sexy girl." ...|$|E

So I'll often hesitate before walking into a new room." [...] He has also spoken <b>about</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> therapy to manage his anxieties – OCD, separation anxiety, social anxiety – and depression, the latter of which he struggled with a lot when he was younger, as well as how acting helped him better cope.

500|$|Futterman {{praised the}} return of Chenoweth's {{character}} April Rhodes, and The Wall Street Journal Raymund Flandez said that she [...] "brings such lightness, humor and zaniness that's endearingly button-nose cute". Fallon wrote, [...] "Chenoweth's every sly smirk, eyebrow tick, and note sung—well, that was my week's highlight." [...] Reiter was unenthusiastic: she acknowledged [...] "Chenoweth's amazing pipes", but added [...] "her character, which was thin to start with, has kind of worn out its welcome". The subplot of Will thinking <b>about</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Broadway with April was roundly criticized: both Meghan Brown of The Atlantic and Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle {{said there was no}} tension at all because the viewer knows that he will stay. The A.V. Club Zack Handlen called the entire scenario [...] "ludicrous", made even more so by the highly compressed time frame, and their dress rehearsal [...] "bizarre", criticisms echoed by Brown.|$|E

[...] Blanchard, nicknamed [...] "Little Doc" [...] due to his father's occupation, attended high school at Saint Stanislaus College in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. He led the school's football team, the Rockachaws, to an undefeated season during his senior year in 1941. Blanchard was recruited to play college football by Army, Fordham University and the University of Notre Dame, among others. Blanchard said in 1985 {{that he had been}} contacted <b>about</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> West Point when he was in high school. He said, [...] "At that point in time, I really wasn’t interested.

500|$|In September 1936, Mickal played {{quarterback for}} the Centennial College All-Stars, a team {{composed}} of college players from southern schools to play against the National Football League's Chicago Bears at Cotton Bowl stadium. He scored the All-Stars' only touchdown with a dive {{into the end zone}} from the one-foot line in the third quarter. The Bears scored their only touchdown later that quarter on a 5-yard run by Bronko Nagurski. Mickal had a chance to tackle Nagurski before the goal line. [...] "A lot of things flashed through my mind," [...] explained Mickal. [...] "There was nothing between him and the goal line but me. I thought about making the perfect tackle and reading about being the All-Stars' hero. Then I thought about Nagurski's size. I thought about the Nagurski legend. I thought <b>about</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> med school. I thought about possible brain damage." [...] He decided to step aside and let Nagurski score. The extra point, however, was blocked by Bob Reynolds, and the game ended 7–6 in favor of the All-Stars. It was the first time a team of college players defeated a professional American football team.|$|E

500|$|Authorities have {{acknowledged}} {{that since the}} exact cause of Bella's death remains unknown, asserting that it was homicide to a jury could be [...] "difficult to prove." [...] Rachelle Bond alleged that McCarthy had punched the toddler in the stomach multiple times after claiming Bella was a [...] "demon", {{and that he was}} the sole perpetrator of the murder. Prosecutors of McCarthy allege that Bella was murdered in one of many abusive occasions after she had been uncooperative <b>about</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bed. Citing that McCarthy had decided to [...] "calm the child down," [...] they say Rachelle had not entered the room alongside her boyfriend. When she did enter, they say she witnessed him near the girl's body, which was [...] "swollen and gray," [...] indicating she was deceased. Rachelle Bond's attorney claims McCarthy threatened to murder her client if she contacted authorities. She also maintained that Rachelle was not involved with hiding the victim's body, which had initially been placed in garbage bags and concealed in a refrigerator. Bond later admitted to this accusation as part of a future plea deal. A cadaver dog brought to the house later indicated that it smelled something on the refrigerator. Bond contradicted the belief that the body was placed on Deer Island; she stated that McCarthy had [...] placed the body in a weighted duffel bag and disposed of it in the water, suggesting it drifted to the location where it was found.|$|E
500|$|Vedder called [...] "Gonna See My Friend" [...] a [...] "drug song," [...] but {{elaborated}} {{that the}} song is <b>about</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> see a friend to stay off drugs, and he stated that [...] "Got Some" [...] is about a [...] "drug dealer," [...] but added what the drug the dealer is selling is actually a great rock song. [...] "Johnny Guitar", described by Vedder as [...] "almost an Elvis Costello homage", had its lyrics inspired by a collage of album covers that is pasted on the bathroom wall of the band's rehearsal space. Vedder noticed the album cover for Johnny [...] "Guitar" [...] Watson's 1979 album, What the Hell Is This?, and imagined a man who becomes attracted {{to one of the}} various women on the cover and then wonders why this woman would rather be one of Watson's many girlfriends instead of his only one. Vedder described [...] "Just Breathe" [...] as [...] "as close to a love song as we've ever gotten," [...] and said that the subject of {{the song is}} the happiest times of people's lives when they should just take in the moment and [...] "breathe for a minute." [...] He also said that [...] "Unthought Known" [...] concerns the human psyche, and [...] "Supersonic" [...] is about the love for music. According to Vedder, [...] "Speed of Sound" [...] is a song taken {{from the perspective of a}} man who is still sitting in a bar after everyone else has left, but he added that even though the song is sad it became more [...] "confident" [...] when played with the whole band. He said [...] "Force of Nature" [...] is [...] "about the strength of one person in the relationship, when they can withstand some of the faults in another." [...] "The End" [...] has been described as an [...] "aching love song." ...|$|E
