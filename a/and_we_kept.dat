500|$|Wednesday 13 {{explained}} the album's inspiration in an interview: [...] "Wednesday 13 (the band) has a live DVD that I put {{out and we}} couldn't think of a title and we were driving down the road thinking, {{we are going to}} have to come up with a name for it. The live titles, you have to put something like that. So, we were watching Bill O'Reilly <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> listening to him say, 'Fuck it, we'll do it live.' That's kind of how quick we threw that DVD together. We didn't know we were putting it together like 4 days before so we were like, 'fuck it, we'll do it live.' We didn't do any overdubs on it, everybody in the band was sick and we just went with it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first guest}} stars {{to appear on}} the show were actors Ernest Borgnine and Tim Conway, reuniting for their first joint TV project in 33 years since the 1960s sitcom McHale's Navy. They {{appeared}} as SpongeBob's favorite superheroes, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, respectively. Hillenburg and Derek Drymon, the show's creative director, enjoyed the actors' roles in McHale's Navy, and they already wanted the two to provide the voices of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy when they were voice casting. Hillenburg and Drymon directly approached Borgnine and Conway, and the actors both accepted. When coming up for the right voice of Mermaid Man, Borgnine cracked his voice by mistake when he was saying [...] "evil!" [...] He said, [...] "By golly! We started something... <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> [...] in." [...] Rock band Ghastly Ones were the first guest stars to appear as themselves, appearing to perform the song [...] "SpongeBob ScaredyPants" [...] in the first-season episode [...] "Scaredy Pants." [...] Their song was then released in the album [...] in 2001. Actors Jim Jarmusch and John Lurie were the first guest stars to appear in live-action. They appeared as themselves in the first-season episode [...] "Hooky" [...] via stock footage from the television program Fishing with John. According to episode writer Vincent Waller, [...] "Someone made us aware of the footage, and they graciously let us use it." [...] The crew planned to film live-action scenes; however, [...] "the Jarmusch and Lurie addition was a very nice surprise." ...|$|E
2500|$|The series {{introduced}} {{new love}} interests for both Tony and Ziva {{in the latter}} half of Season 8, and in February 2011, Michael Ausiello from TVLine announced that Ziva's boyfriend [...] "Ray arrives in this season's 20th episode and is described as a handsome, charming, intelligent federal agent of Mediterranean or Latin American descent. He has a strong, nice-guy demeanor but—I'm quoting from the casting notice here—'there's a hint of a mystery behind his smile.'" [...] A week later, Glasberg described the character as a [...] "fun, smart, exciting addition", and Michael Weatherly commented, [...] "I think it’s going to be interesting. Tony cares about Ziva and wants to make sure she’s not mixed up with the wrong kind of guy, so he’s going to be watchful and protective of her." [...] After Enrique Murciano was cast for the role of Ray Cruz, Cote de Pablo said, [...] "You never know if you're gonna have chemistry, and since I had no say in the casting, I was sort of waiting to meet this famous Enrique Murciano." [...] She went on to describe his appearance in the show: [...] "There's a lovely scene in which he basically brings his interpretation of 'fancy' candlelight dinner, which takes place by the vending machines at NCIS. It's really funny. There's kissing involved. We kept it light <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> it fun, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> it like two people who are genuinely in to each other and wanting to move things along. It's about what's going on between the lines. These two people are touchy-feely, and that's different for Ziva." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That was before. Now it is theirs; <b>and</b> if <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> it {{from them}} {{we should be}} {{stealing}} it. How {{do we know that}} father had any right to give it to us when he did?" ...|$|R
60|$|We allowed no feed {{to escape}} us. At any {{hour of the}} day, {{whenever}} we found a bunch of grass, no matter {{if it were not}} bigger than a broom, we stopped for the horses to graze it <b>and</b> so <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> them on their feet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} was {{impossible}} to beat up against such a wind, <b>and</b> so <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> on toward St. Thomas. The captain had carefully taken the longitude and latitude of the spot where we had been stranded on the ancient ships, and he was sure he could find the place again by sounding in fair weather.|$|R
2500|$|... "Song pluggers" [...] were pianists {{and singers}} who {{represented}} the music publishers, making their living demonstrating songs to promote sales of sheet music. Most music stores had song pluggers on staff. Other pluggers were employed by the publishers to travel and familiarize the public with their new publications. Among the ranks of song pluggers were George Gershwin, Harry Warren, Vincent Youmans and Al Sherman. A more aggressive form of song plugging was known as [...] "booming": it meant buying dozens of tickets for shows, infiltrating the audience and then singing the song to be plugged. At Shapiro Bernstein, Louis Bernstein recalled taking his plugging crew to cycle races at Madison Square Garden: [...] "They had 20,000 people there, we had a pianist and a singer with a large horn. We'd sing a song to them thirty times a night. They'd cheer and yell, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> pounding away at them. When people walked out, they'd be singing the song. They couldn't help it." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We knew {{we could}} have played better in that Test [...] The {{fact that we had}} got so close to the Blacks proved we were close to them in ability, and {{when it came to the}} third Test in Wellington, we had a sense of giving {{everything}} to salvage our reputation. New Zealand had not won a Test match against Australia in Wellington since 1982. Not so long ago, you might think, but let me tell you, that is a lifetime by New Zealand's standards. And what happened that day really angered me. We played as though our lives depended on it; we tackled them as though they were demons; we knocked them back <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> at them, mercilessly hounding them when they had possession and flattening them in some shuddering tackles. Not surprisingly, it won us the Test, but immediately apparent was the question: why the hell hadn't we played like that in the first two Tests?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the breakup, Christensen {{became more}} {{introverted}} than usual, {{and his girlfriend}} could not handle him being in this crisis. He went through a difficult time of coping with both his breakup with the band and with Rosendahl, but {{he went on to}} find his musical style, which resulted in the release of his debut solo album Secrets on Parade in 2000, of which some songs were based on the Dizzy Mizz Lizzy demos from 1998. Several songs on the album were rather ambiguous as to whether they referred to Dizzy Mizz Lizzy or Rosendahl. The album was a success, and it allowed him to further pursue a career in music. Nielsen and Friis initially also intended to continue in music, but turned to a normal working-class life. To walk off the extra weight he had gained from being at home for a long time, Nielsen {{took a job as a}} postman, while Friis became a truck driver delivering gas containers. Despite their different paths, Christensen explained in a 2000 interview that the trio remained friends: [...] "We meet occasionally and have great fun together. Of course we talk about the old days and amuse ourselves with it, because we experienced a lot of great things together and I simply can not remember anything bad from back then. (...) But we just developed ourselves in three different directions, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> growing further apart, so it was simply the time to stop." ...|$|E
5000|$|A six-date {{tour was}} {{announced}} in October 2016. Birds of Tokyo lead singer Ian Kenny said: [...] "When <b>we</b> were writing <b>and</b> recording <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> talking about how {{we wanted to make}} a really dark and intense rock record that would be great to play live. So we can't wait to finally crank out these new songs as well as lots of others at some gigs." ...|$|R
60|$|Even with my aid {{we found}} some little difficulty, <b>and</b> {{meanwhile}} <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> at work restoring the laboratory. There was plenty to do before it became absolutely necessary to decide upon the precise form and method of our second attempt. Our only hitch was the strike of the three labourers, who objected to my activity as a foreman. But that matter we compromised after two days' delay.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot {{tell you}} how much longer <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> on but at last, with our {{strength}} almost gone, a handful of us reached the bottom of a deep gorge. To scale the opposite side {{was out of the question}} <b>and</b> so <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> on down along the sands of what must have been the bed of an ancient river, until finally we came to a point where we looked out upon what appeared to be a beautiful valley in which we felt assured that we would find game in plenty.|$|R
6000|$|... "Cherry," [...] {{said the}} juggler. [...] "We didn't {{know how bad}} you were hurt; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> her away. It's taking the manager and three girls to hold her." ...|$|E
60|$|All {{night we}} rode slowly onward, keeping our horses' tails to the Pole Star. There were many {{tracks in the}} snow, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> {{to the line of}} these, that no one might remark that a body of cavalry had passed that way.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mother used to {{beat her}} for them,' she said, 'but Nurse Ankaret said {{that made her}} worse, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> them secret {{as much as we}} could. To think of her having them before all that English folk! But she will be all right the morn.' ...|$|E
60|$|Then I {{flung open}} a {{cupboard}} door, and what I saw confirmed a growing suspicion. For legal reasons whisky is scarce on {{portions of the}} prairie, but a timely dose of alcohol has saved many a man's life in the Canadian frost, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> always <b>kept</b> some spirits in case of emergency.|$|R
6000|$|But to my tale: A month scarce pass'd away, With dance <b>and</b> song <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> the nuptial day. [...] 330 All I possess'd I gave to his command, My {{goods and}} chattels, money, house, and land; But oft repented, and repent it still; He proved a rebel to my {{sovereign}} will; Nay, once, by heaven! he struck {{me on the}} face; Hear but the fact, and judge yourselves the case.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Gigsultz magazine, John Herbert spoke of the band's love of Lucerne and Switzerland: “We {{fell in love with}} the city <b>and</b> the people. <b>We</b> <b>kept</b> going back whenever we could even though our manager wanted us to mix it in London." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed; I {{should think}} she would be proud to help with one of your pictures, sir. My sister thinks they are very lovely; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> one of them {{when we had to}} sell all the rest," [...] said Jessie, in her eager, frank way.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not of all; for Indian sight is too keen to {{be easily}} cheated, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> close. A {{difficult}} matter it was, too, to keep this Mohican boy snug in the ambushment. Ah! Uncas, Uncas, your behavior was more {{like that of a}} curious woman than of a warrior on his scent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! {{you don't}} know Sarah's temper {{or you would}} wonder no more. I tried it when I came to Croydon, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> on until about two months ago, {{when we had to}} part. I don't want to say a word against my own sister, but she was always meddlesome and hard to please, was Sarah." ...|$|E
5000|$|In the August 1991 Guitar World interview, May {{spoke about}} the mixing of song. [...] "For some reason, 'I Can't Live with You' was almost {{impossible}} to mix. It {{was one of those things}} where you put all the faders up and it sounds pretty good, and you think, 'We'll work on this for a couple of hours.' Then it gets worse and worse <b>and</b> worse. <b>We</b> <b>kept</b> going back to the rough mix. It's got an atmosphere to it. I think it sounds so special because <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> a lot of the demo stuff on it. Usually it all gets replaced." ...|$|R
30|$|Diagnostic and {{operative}} outpatient hysteroscopy {{was performed}} with a 5.5  mm rigid continuous flow hysteroscopic system with 12 ° or 30 ° optics (Olympus, Melville, N.Y., USA), with a five French working channel. Hydrodilatation was with normal saline solution, and operating instruments included scissors, graspers and the bipolar Versapoint device. We used mostly twizzle electrode for coagulating <b>and</b> cutting. <b>We</b> <b>kept</b> the input pressure below 100  mmHg. Operating time was always less than 45  min.|$|R
6000|$|But to my tale: A month scarce passed away, [...] With dance <b>and</b> song, <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> the nuptial day. [...] 330 [...] All I possessed I gave to his command, [...] My {{goods and}} chattels, money, house, and land: [...] But oft repented, and repent it still;[27] [...] He proved a rebel to my sov'reign will: [...] Nay, once, by heav'n! he struck {{me on the}} face; [...] 335 [...] Hear but the fact, and judge, yourselves, the case.|$|R
6000|$|We then resumed rowing, and {{presently}} I heard [...] "Oars!" [...] again; {{but from}} another boat, the second cutter, {{which turned out}} to be carrying a Lieutenant ashore. If was now Captain Claret's turn to be honoured. The cutter lay still, and the Lieutenant off hat; while the Captain only nodded, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> on our way.|$|E
60|$|To me, and to Frank, also, {{for that}} matter, {{it was all}} new and startling, and we were as excited as the dogs. We kept {{continually}} moving about, Frank mounted, and I afoot, to get good views of the cougar. When she crouched as if to leap, {{it was almost impossible}} to remain under the tree, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> moving.|$|E
60|$|Every {{moment that}} {{lengthened}} the veritable enchantment of that autumn afternoon was precious beyond what we knew, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> Miss Sandford prowling about the garden on {{all sorts of}} pretexts, till the poor girl was tired out, as well she might be, for we had kept her on her feet for three hours and a half, and she made her escape at last to join Viola.|$|E
5000|$|... "Fever" [...] was {{recorded}} in January 2013 at Key Club in Benton Harbor, Michigan, during the group's initial recording sessions for Turn Blue. Describing the song's origin, guitarist Dan Auerbach said, [...] "that one started with that melody. And it was Patrick Carney and I on our own; we recorded that song and it came pretty quickly. I had that melody in my mind, worked out what the chords were <b>and</b> then <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> it really simple. <b>We</b> <b>kept</b> the bass <b>and</b> drums simple and dancey and tried to keep it upbeat — sort of like Motown". The group worked on the song's coda with producer Danger Mouse in subsequent sessions.|$|R
60|$|For {{three hours}} <b>and</b> more <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> {{on in our}} {{serpentine}} course, for the river meandered as whimsically as if it still had a choice of its own in the matter. Then gradually the land about began to make overtures toward sociability. The trees on the banks disappeared, the banks themselves decreased in height; then the river took to a more genial flow, <b>and</b> presently <b>we</b> were ware of the whole countryside to the right coming down in one long sweep to the water's edge.|$|R
30|$|Results: Among the 2729 {{patients}} included, 2051 patients {{entered the}} weaning process <b>and</b> <b>we</b> only <b>kept</b> {{in the present}} analysis the 1812 patients {{who did not have}} any decision of withholding or withdrawing mechanical ventilation. Among these 1812 patients, 1413 (78  %) had a SW and 399 (22  %) had a weaning duration longer than 24  hours. Main clinical characteristics are shown in Table 95.|$|R
60|$|I nodded, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> silent after that, {{the boat}} {{slipping}} gently {{through the water}} and Big Alec growing nearer and nearer. We could see him quite plainly, gaffing the sturgeon and throwing them into the boat while his companion ran the line and cleared the hooks as he dropped {{them back into the}} water. Nevertheless, we were five hundred yards away when the big fisherman hailed us.|$|E
60|$|I now {{write of}} the time when I had been married, I suppose, {{about a year and a}} half. After several {{varieties}} of experiment, we had given up the housekeeping as a bad job. The house kept itself, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> a page. The principal function of this retainer was to quarrel with the cook; in which respect he was a perfect Whittington, without his cat, or the remotest chance of being made Lord Mayor.|$|E
6000|$|... “No, {{we went to}} Washington {{first and}} there we pawned one diamond for sixty dollars. Then we went to Jacksonville. There we met Luke Watson, and both of us got scared to death. We had paid for our passage on the Emma Brower, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> out of sight till the bark sailed. After the storm we landed here with those four sailors, and were waiting to sight some passing ship when you and your crowd turned up.” ...|$|E
30|$|Next, {{we found}} an {{approximate}} {{solution for the}} linear third-order equation of variable coefficients, (68) <b>and</b> although <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> only two terms of the Taylor series of sin(x), LT-HPM got a precise approximation (see Figure  3). Iterations (86), (87), (88), (89) and (90) for LT-HPM show again a long computational process compared to NDLT-HPM (110), (111), (112), (113) and (114) but the Figure  3 reveals that in fact, both methods are highly accurate, and although NDLT-HPM is handier its absolute error is again slightly less accurate.|$|R
40|$|The {{scenario}} of present day of information security system includes confidentiality, authenticity, integrity, non-repudiation.
