40|$|Most organisms, {{ranging from}} mammals to bacteria, are {{dependent}} of {{their sense of}} smell {{in order to survive}} and reproduce. In moths, the detection of odorants is performed by olfactory sensory neurons located on the antenna. The sensory neurons bring olfactory information directly to the primary olfactory center in the brain, the antennal lobe. Onwards, projection neurons following one of three main tracts bring the information to higher olfactory centers including the mushroom body calyces and the lateral horn. In addition, neurons confined to the antennal lobe, local interneurons, influence the processing within the antennal lobe. This arrangement enables the animal to detect and identify the olfactory input, and to behave appropriately according to the odor. In addition to the detection of ordinary odorants, male moths have the ability to detect pheromones and interspecific substances released by conspecific and heterospesifics females, respectively. In the antennal lobe, the characteristic synaptic structures, termed glomeruli, are anatomically separated in to two systems, one male-specific compartment called the makroglomerular complex, and one consisting of ordinary glomeruli. In order to increase the knowledge about odor processing in the moth brain, intracellular recordings and staining was conducted. In this thesis, two functionally different types of projection neurons were characterized, one male-specific type innervating the macroglomerular complex, and one plant odor type innervating ordinary glomeruli. Among the projection neurons innervating ordinary glomeruli, distinct morphological categories, associated with different <b>antenna</b> <b>lobe</b> tracts, were found. Among the scientifically interesting results of the present study, is the finding that <b>antenna</b> <b>lobe</b> output neurons underlying different behaviors target seemingly non-overlapping regions of the lateral horn. </p...|$|E

A model is made of such oscillations in the case of two observatories located at equal longitudes and opposite tropical latitudes, respectively in Ha Noi (Viet Nam) and Learmonth (Australia), where similar radio telescopes are operated at 1. 4 GHz.

Here, we report that the <b>antenna</b> <b>lobe</b> (AL) spatial map is transformed further in the calyx of the mushroom body (MB), an essential olfactory associated learning center, by stereotypic connections with projection neurons (PNs). We found that Kenyon cell (KC) dendrites are segregated into 17 complementary domains according to their neuroblast clonal origins and birth orders. Aligning the PN axonal map with the KC dendritic map and ultrastructural observation suggest a positional ordering such that inputs from the different AL glomeruli have distinct representations in the MB calyx, and these representations might synapse on functionally distinct KCs.

40|$|Abstract Background Deformed wing virus (DWV) is a positive-strand RNA {{virus that}} infects European honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) {{and has been}} {{isolated}} from the brains of aggressive bees in Japan. DWV {{is known to be}} transmitted both vertically and horizontally between bees in a colony and can lead to both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections in bees. In environmentally stressful conditions, DWV can contribute to the demise of a honeybee colony. The purpose of the current study is to identify regions within the brains of honeybees where DWV replicates using in-situ hybridization. Results In-situ hybridizations were conducted with both sense and antisense probes on the brains of honeybees that were positive for DWV as measured by real-time RT-PCR. The visual neuropils demonstrated detectable levels of the DWV positive-strand genome. The mushroom bodies and <b>antenna</b> <b>lobe</b> neuropils also showed the presence of the viral genome. Weaker staining with the sense probe in the same regions demonstrates that the antigenome is also present and that the virus is actively replicating in these regions of the brain. Conclusion These results demonstrate that in bees infected with DWV the virus is replicating in critical regions of the brain, including the neuropils responsible for vision and olfaction. Therefore DWV infection of the brain could adversely affect critical sensory functions and alter normal bee behavior. </p...|$|E
40|$|The antennal lobes of {{different}} castes of the ant species Camponotus compressus show a marked {{diversity in the}} organization of their olfactory glomeruli. Notably, there is {{a significant difference in the}} number and size of glomeruli between the reproductives and the workers and among the different worker castes. In this report, we investigate the notion that these caste-specific differences in glomerular number might be accounted for, at least in part, by the differences in numbers of olfactory sensilla that target the <b>antenna!</b> <b>lobe.</b> For this, we examine the number of sensilla on the antenna! flagella of all the individual castes of C. compressus. This analysis reveals a striking correlation between sensillar number and the number of antennal glomeruli in a given caste. As a first step in investigating the causal mechanisms that might give raise to this correlation, we carry out an initial characterization of olfactory system development in the minor workers of C. compressus. We analyze the temporal pattern of innervations of the developing antennal lobe by olfactory sensory neuron axons. We document the development of the olfactory glomeruli in the antennal lobe during this process, which occurs during early pupal stages. Our findings provide the basis for future manipulative developmental studies on the role of sensory afferent number in glomerular development {{of different}} castes within the same species.

40|$|Neural {{circuits}} exploit numerous {{strategies for}} encoding information. Although the functional significance of individual coding mechanisms has been investigated, {{ways in which}} multiple mechanisms interact and integrate are not well understood. The locust olfactory system, in which dense, transiently synchronized spike trains across ensembles of <b>antenna</b> <b>lobe</b> (AL) neurons are transformed into a sparse representation in the mushroom body (MB; a region associated with memory), provides a well-studied preparation for investigating the interaction of multiple coding mechanisms. Recordings made in vivo from the insect MB demonstrated highly specific responses to odors in Kenyon cells (KCs). Typically, only a few KCs from the recorded population of neurons responded reliably when a specific odor was presented. Different odors induced responses in different KCs. Here, we explored with a biologically plausible model {{the possibility that a}} form of plasticity may control and tune synaptic weights of inputs to the mushroom body to ensure the specificity of KCs ’ responses to familiar or meaningful odors. We found that plasticity at the synapses between the AL and the MB efficiently regulated the delicate tuning necessary to selectively filter the intense AL oscillatory output and condense it to a sparse representation in the MB. Activity-dependent plasticity drove the observed specificity, reliability, and expected persistence of odor representations, suggesting a role for plasticity in information processing and making a testable prediction abou...|$|E
40|$|Several {{experiments}} {{indicate that}} there exists substantial synaptic-depression at the synapses between olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and neurons within the drosophila <b>antenna</b> <b>lobe</b> (AL). This synaptic-depression may be partly caused by vesicle-depletion, and partly caused by presynaptic-inhibition due to the activity of inhibitory local neurons within the AL. While it has been proposed that this synaptic-depression contributes to the nonlinear relationship between ORN and projection neuron (PN) firing-rates, the precise functional role of synaptic-depression at the ORN synapses is not yet fully understood. In this paper we propose two hypotheses linking the information-coding properties of the fly AL with the network mechanisms responsible for ORN?AL synaptic-depression. Our first hypothesis is related to variance coding of ORN firing-rate information — once stimulation to the ORNs is sufficiently high to saturate glomerular responses, further stimulation of the ORNs increases the regularity of PN spiking activity while maintaining PN firing-rates. The second hypothesis proposes a tradeoff between spike-time reliability and coding-capacity governed by the relative contribution of vesicle-depletion and presynaptic-inhibition to ORN?AL synaptic-depression. Synaptic-depression caused primarily by vesicle-depletion will {{give rise to a}} very reliable system, whereas an equivalent amount of synaptic-depression caused primarily by presynaptic-inhibition will give rise to a less reliable system that is more sensitive to small shifts in odor stimulation.

40|$|Abstract Background Precise {{connections}} {{of neural}} circuits {{can be specified}} by genetic programming. In the Drosophila olfactory system, projection neurons (PNs) send dendrites to single glomeruli in the <b>antenna</b> <b>lobe</b> (AL) based upon lineage and birth order and send axons with stereotyped terminations to higher olfactory centers. These decisions are likely specified by a PN-intrinsic transcriptional code that regulates the expression of cell-surface molecules to instruct wiring specificity. Results We find {{that the loss of}} longitudinals lacking (lola), which encodes a BTB-Zn-finger transcription factor with 20 predicted splice isoforms, results in wiring defects in both axons and dendrites of all lineages of PNs. RNA in situ hybridization and quantitative RT-PCR suggest that most if not all lola isoforms are expressed in all PNs, but different isoforms are expressed at widely varying levels. Overexpression of individual lola isoforms fails to rescue the lola null phenotypes and causes additional phenotypes. Loss of lola also results in ectopic expression of Gal 4 drivers in multiple cell types and in the loss of transcription factor gene lim 1 expression in ventral PNs. Conclusion Our results indicate that lola is required for wiring of axons and dendrites of most PN classes, and suggest a need for its molecular diversity. Expression pattern changes of Gal 4 drivers in lola -/- clones imply that lola normally represses the expression of these regulatory elements in a subset of the cells surrounding the AL. We propose that Lola functions as a general transcription factor that regulates the expression of multiple genes ultimately controlling PN identity and wiring specificity. </p...|$|E

40|$|In the {{principal}} {{cells of the}} insect mushroom body, the Kenyon cells (KC), olfactory information is represented by a spatially and temporally sparse code. Each odor stim-ulus will activate {{only a small portion}} of neurons (spatial sparseness) and each stimulus leads to only a short phasic response following stimulus onset (temporal or lifetime sparseness) irrespective of the actual duration of a con-stant stimulus. The mechanisms responsible for the tem-porally sparse code in the KCs are yet unresolved. Here, we explore the role of the neuron-intrinsic mecha-nism of spike frequency adaptation (SFA) in producing temporally sparse responses to sensory stimulation in higher processing stages. SFA is an ubiquitous phenom-ena found in many different model systems. Our single neuron model is defined through a full five-dimensional master equation for a conductance-based integrate-and-fire neuron with spike-frequency adaptation [1]. We study a fully connected feed-forward network architecture in coarse analogy to the insect olfactory pathway. A first layer of ten neurons represents the projection neurons (PNs) of the <b>antenna</b> <b>lobe.</b> All PNs receive a step-like input from the olfactory receptor neurons, which was realized by independent Poisson processes. The second layer repre-sents 100 KCs which converge onto ten neurons in the output layer which represents the population of mush-room body extrinsic neurons (ENs). Figure 1. Our simulation result matches well with the experimental observations. In particular, intracellular recordings of PNs locust express sharp transient responses [3]. We conclude that the neuron-intrinsic SFA mechanism is sufficient to explain a progressive temporal response sparsening in the insect olfactory system. Further experimental work is needed to test this hypothesis empirically...|$|E

The sensor {{of choice is}} an Airborne Moving-Target-Indicator (AMTI) radar, which is a Pulse-Doppler radar equipped with AMTI signal processor. Our specific area of interest is detecting airborne obstacles, while the aircraft is in the phase of final approach for landing (or during takeoff). An adjunct area, due to be addressed under a different cover, is the detection of obstacles on the runway during the same phases of flight. The main impediment to successful obstacle detection is the interference of terrain clutter. This problem aside, even a non-AMTI radar is capable of detecting typical airborne obstacles [...] -moving or stationary (floating) [...] - at ranges {{in the order of}} 20 mi. In X-band frequencies, it is the ground clutter [...] -not receiver noise or weather attenuation [...] - against which the target signal has to compete. Depending on the geometry, this clutter is received through either the main <b>antenna</b> <b>lobe</b> or its sidelobes. To determine which antenna lobes contribute clutter, one has to find the ground intersection (for a flat terrain, it's a circle) with the sphere of radius equal to the target range. The angles from the antenna boresight to points on this line of intersection, and the antenna beam pattern, determine which lobes receive clutter. Therefore, assuming a horizontal antenna pointing, the higher the flight altitude, and the shorter the range, the farther (angularly) the deleterious sidelobes are from boresight [...] -meaning less clutter. This is why there is no much concern about obstacle detection during the cruise phase of the flight.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 The moth {{olfactory}} {{network is}} one of the simplest biological neural systems capable of Learning. It is thus ideal for exploring how learning occurs. The network, which includes the <b>antenna</b> <b>lobe,</b> mushroom body, and ancillary structures, contains several key structural motifs widespread in biological neural systems and of great interest. These include cascading networks, large dimension shifts from stage to stage, high-dimensional sparse codings of data, randomness, Hebbian ("fire together, wire together'') plasticity, and octopamine stimulation as {{a vital part of the}} learning mechanism. While these components are widespread in natural neural systems, they are largely absent from the engineered neural nets of machine learning. This thesis has three goals: To characterize the various components of the moth's olfactory system and how they enable it to learn; to port the moth's ``bag of tricks'' to machine learning contexts; and to examine learning as an injury mitigation mechanism. Our approach is to build a full computational model of the moth olfactory system with the following properties: Its structure and mechanics are tightly tethered to current knowledge of the moth olfactory system; its behavior statistically matches experimental data; and it is able to robustly learn new odors. To our knowledge this is the first full neural network model that is tightly tied in structure and behavior to a real biological system, and that also demonstrates learning behavior. From a Biology perspective, the model is a valuable platform to examine how key structural features enable learning in nature. For example, we analyse the role of octopamine stimulation and the functions of high-dimensional sparse network stages in learning. The model also allows predictions about structural details of the olfactory system that are not currently well-characterized. In addition, we explore the role of learning, and other structural features, as injury mitigation mechanisms. From a Machine Learning perspective, the model allows us to identify promising structures and tools that can be ported to ML systems. For example, it offers bio-mimetic solutions to two open concerns in human-built Neural Nets: It uses a biologically-plausible optimization method to train the network, potentially bridging a long-standing gap between natural and human-built neural nets; and it requires few training samples, offering a potential means to address a current bottleneck in use of neural nets, viz their vast appetite for training data...|$|E

This paper shows that the two problems are interrelated, and involve the construction of a “point spread function ” from neighboring image pixels generated by a scanning antenna system. As part of this analysis, the effects of retrieval noise are considered. Finally, the paper shows that if the radiometric image is processed to enhance the spatial resolution, sampling at the Nyquist rate results in a perfect deconvolution of the scene brightness temperature, consistent with the results of Shannon’s sampling theorem...|$|R
