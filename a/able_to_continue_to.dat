5|$|Jedi Knight is {{primarily}} a first-person shooter, although it does offer {{the choice of a}} third-person view. The game consists of twenty-one levels with objectives which the player must complete before being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> the next level. There are weapons available in each level and after level three, the player has the use of a lightsaber, along with the Force. In addition to being an effective weapon, the lightsaber is also a useful tool for the player, providing light in dark areas, deflecting incoming blaster fire and cutting through some obstacles.|$|E
5|$|The Inchon {{landings}} were {{a crushing}} blow for the North Korean Army, catching it completely unprepared and breaking the already weak forces along the perimeter. With virtually no equipment, exhausted manpower and low morale, the North Koreans {{were at a}} severe disadvantage and were not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> pressure on the Pusan Perimeter while attempting to repel the landings at Inchon. By September 23, the North Koreans were in full retreat from the Pusan Perimeter, with UN forces rapidly pursuing them north and recapturing lost ground along the way.|$|E
5|$|The {{organs of}} farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while {{fishermen}} supplied those of pinnipeds {{and the smaller}} whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.|$|E

5|$|Mysteries of the Sith is {{primarily}} a first-person shooter, but offers {{the choice of a}} third-person view. Unlike Dark Forces II, where the player's actions within the game dictate whether the story ends with the light side or the dark side ending, Mysteries of the Sith has a single, morally positive course. The player progresses through the game in a linear fashion; there are fourteen levels and each has set objectives that the player must complete before being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> the next level. Within each level the player can encounter both hostile and non-hostile non-player characters (NPCs). As well as including some enemies that featured in Dark Forces II, Mysteries of the Sith adds twenty new monsters, including a rancor. Some non-hostile NPCs may help the player by attacking enemies.|$|E
5|$|On State's {{first play}} after the punt, fullback Mal Crite {{ran for a}} 40-yard gain, pushing State's offense to the Tech 46-yard line with just over four minutes left. State pushed forward another seven yards, but failed to gain another first down and {{prepared}} to punt the ball back to Tech with 3:14 remaining in the game. Rather than punt the ball, however, State punter Kelly Hollodick instead received the snap on fourth down and ran for a first down. Because State retained possession, it was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> run down the clock after the fake punt. Tech stopped the clock once by calling a timeout and prevented State from gaining another first down. With 2:01 remaining in the game, State punted the ball into Tech's end zone for a touchback.|$|E
25|$|In 717 BC, the Syro-Hittite city of Carchemish on the Upper Euphrates rebelled. Carchemish {{was a small}} kingdom {{situated}} at an important Euphrates crossing. Sargon violated existing treaties in attacking the city, but with the wealth seized was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> fund his army.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the studies}} {{conducted}} by the ACP in 2005, the canal would reach its maximum sustainable capacity between 2009 and 2012. When it reached this capacity {{it would not be}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> handle growth in demand, resulting in a reduction in the competitiveness of the Panama maritime route.|$|E
25|$|Circular {{migration}} {{may also}} perpetuate existing inequalities. A worker’s social class predicts {{the work that}} he or she will qualify for, and those who are most successful in their home country are most <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> be successful by improving the economic and social situation of their household. The optimistic “win-win-win” discourse can often overlook the many costs involved in circular migration, as well as the difficulty that exists in implementing policies specifically for circular migration.|$|E

5000|$|The third {{bill passed}} during the {{legislative}} session of 2011 was SB 880/HB 281 Value Adjustment Boards. This legislation deals with cash strapped school districts, cities, and counties in obtaining greater funding during difficult economic times. Property owners {{who disagree with}} their property’s assessed value would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> appealing <b>to</b> their county’s value adjustment board (VAB). There would just be needed changes {{to ensure that the}} process be done equally and beneficial to all citizens of the counties they reside in.|$|R
25|$|On 25 July 1961, Clive Sinclair founded {{his first}} company, Sinclair Radionics Ltd. in Cambridge. The company {{developed}} hi-fi products, radios, calculators and scientific instruments. When {{it became clear}} that Radionics was failing, Sinclair took steps to ensure that he would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> pursue his commercial goals. In February 1975, he changed the name of Ablesdeal Ltd (a shelf company he had bought in September 1973 for just such an eventuality) to Westminster Mail Order Ltd. The name was changed to Sinclair Instrument Ltd in August 1975.|$|E
25|$|Vysotsky's {{associates}} had all put {{in efforts}} to supply his drug habit, which kept him going {{in the last years}} of his life. Under their influence he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> perform all over the country, up to a week before his death. Due to illegal (i.e. non-state-sanctioned) sales of tickets and other underground methods, these concerts pulled in sums of money unimaginable in Soviet times, when almost everyone received nearly the same small salary. The payouts and gathering of money were a constant source of danger, and Yanklovich and others were needed to organise them.|$|E
25|$|On 23 October 2007, the Ålandsfärjan {{touched the}} bottom near Mariehamn. Passengers were readied for evacuation, but an {{inspection}} of the ship revealed no major damage and she was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> Mariehamn under her own power, arriving some 30 minutes behind schedule. As {{a result of the}} accident, all departures until 22 November were cancelled. Investigations revealed that the cause for the accident was the new duty rosters: the officer on duty was inspecting the new roster and because of that failed to notice that the ship should have made a course change whilst approaching Mariehamn.|$|E
50|$|Following {{a stroke}} in 2013, Young {{retired from the}} concert stage, no longer <b>able</b> <b>to</b> play.

25|$|At 2:30p.m., Major General Meade {{had learned}} of Miles's {{difficulties}} subduing Cooke's force and ordered Major General Humphreys {{to take one}} of his divisions back to Sutherland's Station to support Miles. By the time Humphreys arrived back at Sutherland's Station with Hays's division, he found out that Miles's final attack had been successful. Miles and Hays camped near Sutherland's Station to protect their roadblock of the railroad. Humphreys later wrote that the whole Confederate force probably would have been captured if the II Corps had been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> Sutherland's Station that morning. Other than the 600 taken prisoners, Confederate casualties at Sutherland's Station are unknown. Miles had 366 casualties.|$|E
25|$|The battle {{completely}} halted Ya`qub's {{advance and}} put an end to what was arguably a major threat to the Abbasid Caliphate. Ya`qub did not make any subsequent campaigns against Iraq. Al-Mu'tamid, following the victory, restored several individuals to their governorships in Iran, such as Muhammad bin Wasil to Fars and Muhammad bin Tahir to Khurasan, but they were unable to enforce their claims against the Saffarids. Ya`qub died three years later, in 879; his brother and successor, 'Amr concluded a peace with the caliph that lasted for a few years. The Abbasids were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> work reasserting their authority in several provinces; the Zanj were defeated in 883, and Egypt and Fars would eventually return to the Abbasid fold.|$|E
25|$|The fission of a {{heavy nucleus}} {{requires}} a total input energy of about 7 to 8 million electron volts (MeV) to initially overcome the nuclear force which holds the nucleus into a spherical or nearly spherical shape, and from there, deform it into a two-lobed ("peanut") shape in which the lobes are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> separate from each other, pushed by their mutual positive charge, in the most common process of binary fission (two positively charged fission products + neutrons). Once the nuclear lobes have been pushed to a critical distance, beyond which the short range strong force can no longer hold them together, the process of their separation proceeds from {{the energy of the}} (longer range) electromagnetic repulsion between the fragments. The result is two fission fragments moving away from each other, at high energy.|$|E
50|$|The next morning, Hides was {{threatened}} by a party of natives who had crossed the river in the night. He was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> escape, but <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> meet unfriendly natives, {{and was forced to}} open fire on a group ambushing him, killing one to three. Eventually the patrol passed north of the Karius Range.|$|R

50|$|Timur {{crossed the}} Indus River at Attock (now in Pakistan) on 24 September 1398. His {{invasion}} {{did not go}} unopposed and he encountered resistance by the Governor of Meerut during the march to Delhi. Timur was still <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> his approach <b>to</b> Delhi, arriving in 1398, to fight the armies of Sultan Nasir-ud-Din Mahmud Shah Tughluq, which had already been weakened by a succession struggle within the royal family.|$|R
25|$|At {{the same}} time Bedouin herding was {{restricted}} by land expropriation. The Black Goat Law of 1950 curbed grazing so as to prevent land erosion, prohibiting the grazing of goats outside recognized land holdings. Because few Bedouin territorial claims were recognized, most grazing was rendered illegal. Since both Ottoman and British land registration processes had failed to reach into the Negev region before Israeli rule, and since most Bedouin preferred not to register their lands, few Bedouin possessed any documentation of their land claims. Those whose land claims were recognized found {{it almost impossible to}} keep their goats within the periphery of their newly limited range. Into the 1970s and 1980s, {{only a small portion of}} the Bedouin were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> graze their goats, and instead of migrating with their goats in search of pasture, most Bedouin migrated in search of work.|$|E
25|$|Although WCW tried all {{it could}} to {{alleviate}} the strain of debt in early 2001, the financial burdens proved too heavy to bear for the promotion and its new parent, AOL Time Warner. Once it gained the power to sell off WCW, AOL Time Warner looked to unload its financial albatross. A sale nearly occurred in late 2000 to Bischoff {{and a group of}} private investors calling themselves Fusient Media Ventures, with news reports and even Eric Bischoff declaring a deal was in place. However, Fusient backed out when Turner networks head Jamie Kellner formally cancelled all WCW programming from its television networks. With no network on which to air its programming, WCW was of little value to Fusient, whose offer depended on being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> air WCW programming on the Turner networks, despite the fact that WCW, according to Bischoff in his book, had received offers from FOX and NBC.|$|E
25|$|On 28 November 1968 the Ilmatar was {{en route}} from Stockholm to Turku in heavy fog with 177 {{passengers}} on board. She was scheduled to pass Botnia of Siljavarustamo near Långnäs, Åland around 2 AM. Both ships were in radar and radio {{contact with each other}} and their captains agreed on where and when the ships would pass each other. Despite the precautions the ships collided at 2:12 am, after the Botnia had accidentally drifted to {{the wrong side of the}} shipway. Due to the heavy fog, visual contact was not established until five seconds before the collision. The Ilmatars bow hit the Botnias starboard side in a 40° angle, tearing a 40-meter gash on the Botnia and destroying eight cabins. One crew member and two passengers of the Botnia were killed instantly, while seven passengers were seriously injured and three of them died later on. The Ilmatars bow was entirely destroyed but no people on board here were seriously injured. She was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> Turku under her own power, and re-entered service after repairs on 8 December 1968. The crew of the Ilmatar were found innocent of causing the accident.|$|E
