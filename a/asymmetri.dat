A major barrier to discovery of such ideal DSC biomarkers is difficulty in obtaining DSCs {{in sufficient quantity}} and purity. To solve this problem, we used cell lines genetically engineered for conditional asymmetric self-renewal, the defining DSC property. In gene microarray analyses, we identified 85 genes whose expression is tightly asymmetric self-renewal associated (ASRA). The ASRA gene signature prescribed DSCs to undergo asymmetric self-renewal {{to a greater extent}} than committed progenitor cells, embryonic stem cells, or induced pluripotent stem cells. This delineation has several significant implications.

Prior empirical evidence has been lukewarm in its support of this behavior. Most of the research has been conducted using samples of American firms. This paper examines the validity of the pecking order hypothesis in emerging market countries. One of the driving forces behind the pecking order hypothesis is that managers have more information about the value of the company than do outside investors. Examining pecking order behavior in emerging markets would seem like an ideal place to find support for the hypothesis because the problems for outside investors are huge. Compared to investors in the US, investors in emerging markets receive less information, the information they do receive is likely to be distorted (managed), and the legal rights they possess are worse than their counterparts in the US. Using a sample of 23 countries, we find no support for this hypothesis. Firms in these countries finance their deficit mainly with equity and issue equity much more often than would be expected under this hypothesis.

By focusing on weakly selected regions that could be {{oriented with respect to}} replication in 43 out of 51 completely sequenced bacterial chromosomes, {{we have been able to}} detect asymmetric directional mutation pressures. Results: Most of the 43 chromosomes were found to be relatively enriched in G over C and T over A, and slightly depleted in G+C, in their weakly selected positions (intergenic regions and third codon positions) in the leading strand compared with the lagging strand. Deviations from A = T and G = C were highly correlated between third codon positions and intergenic regions, with a lower degree of deviation in intergenic regions, and were not correlated with overall genomic G+C content.
