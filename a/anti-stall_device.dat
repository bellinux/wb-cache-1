5000|$|The [...] saw Webber claim pole position, despite McLaren and Ferrari {{having a}} straight-line speed advantage. At the start, the <b>anti-stall</b> <b>device</b> on Webber's car came on, {{dropping}} the Australian to 5th. Vettel meanwhile in 3rd (after starting 4th) was chasing Jenson Button for 2nd place when he {{collided with the}} Brit at the Bus Stop. After sensing an inside passing opportunity, Vettel attempted to quickly change direction while under braking, causing the car to spear {{into the side of}} Button's McLaren. Button retired from the race, while Vettel was able to pit for repairs. He subsequently received a drive-through penalty for his action, and suffered a rear tyre puncture while attempting to overtake Vitantonio Liuzzi, finishing 15th. Webber was able to capitalise on the DNF of Button and Alonso, as well as a mistake by Renault's Robert Kubica during his pit stop, and finish 2nd, behind race winner Hamilton.|$|E
50|$|The <b>anti-stall</b> <b>devices</b> {{activated}} {{while they}} were at altitude, but the pilots overrode the automatic nose-down that would increase speed to prevent stall. After four overrides, both engines experienced flameout and shut down. The plane then stalled, and the pilots recovered from the stall at FL380 while still having no engines. At that altitude, there were six airports within reach for a forced landing. This led the pilots to pitch nose down {{in an attempt to}} restart the engines, which requires a dive sharp enough to attain the required 300 kn for a windmill restart to make the blades in the turbines windmill at 10% N2 (turbine rotational speed). The captain did not take the necessary steps to ensure that the first officer achieved the 300 kn or greater airspeed required for the windmill engine restart procedure and then did not demonstrate command authority by taking control of the airplane and accelerating it to at least that speed.|$|R
