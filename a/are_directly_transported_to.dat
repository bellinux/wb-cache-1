40|$|Nuclear {{matrices}} {{were prepared}} by DNase and high salt extraction of SV 40 -infected epithelial monkey cells. The matrices retain {{the majority of}} SV 40 virions. This conclusion is based on electron microscopic observations of the occurrence of encapsidated viral DNA that is resistant to DNase digestion and on the analysis of viral proteins by gel electrophoresis. Pulse labeled SV 40 RNA is also associated with the nuclear matrix (less than 15 % of the viral RNA is removed by DNase and high salt). Pulse-chase experiments revealed that processing of SV 40 RNA takes place on the nuclear matrix and the processed molecules <b>are</b> <b>directly</b> <b>transported</b> <b>to</b> the cytoplasm where they {{are associated with the}} cytoskeleton.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Chylomicrons from villous {{columnar}} {{epithelial cells}} are generally {{known to be}} transported only by central lymph vessels (CLV), whereas antigenic particulates derived from the intestinal lumen can also be transported by subepithelial blood capillaries (sBCs) in rat intestinal villi. The possibility of chylomicron absorption by sBCs was histoplanimetrically studied in the rat jejunum under a transmission electron microscope. The chylomicrons more abundantly presented in villous venules than in arterioles. The most frequent size (MFS) of chylomicrons was 75 to 90 nm in diameter in the areas near sBCs, while it was 45 to 60 nm in the epithelial intercellular spaces just above sBCs or the intermediate areas between sBCs. The MFS of chylomicrons was 45 to 60 nm in the intermediate areas between sBCs and in the epithelial intercellular spaces just above these areas. The MFS of chylomicrons in CLV was intermediate between that in the area adjacent to sBCs {{and that in the}} intermediate areas between sBCs. Chylomicrons were found in small vesicles in the endothelial cytoplasms of sBCs. No chylomicrons larger than 600 nm were observed in the lamina propria. These findings suggest that some of the chylomicrons smaller than 75 nm, which are probable intestinal very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), <b>are</b> <b>directly</b> <b>transported</b> <b>to</b> the liver by hepati...|$|E

The experiment was conducted on soil, {{and nutrient}} loss from 5 º slope. Individual grasses plots for rye grass(Lolium), white clover(Trifolium repens) and integrated grass (rye + white clover) plots were prepared with a percentage cover of 25, 50, 80 and 100 in each treatment. Bare land was used as a reference plot. The results show that, the sediment loss in a bare land reported to be 1. 5, 3, 2. 7 and 1. 3, 2. 1, 1. 9 in 100 % and 80 % cover plots. The runoff rate as compared to bare land, shown to be about 2 times less for white clover and rye grass plots, while more than 2 times less for integrated grasses plots. The total nitrogen and organic matter loss the results were in the order bare land white clover rye grasses and integrated grasses in which 100 %, 80 % and 50 % vegetative cover shown to perform better. On average enrichment ratio range was 40 % to 90 % for nutrient loss, and 50 % to 85 % for organic matter for all plots in comparison with soil origin. The enrichment ration significantly shown to be high from bare land> rye and white clover plots> integrated grasses plot. It has been concluded that integrated grasses is more effective measure over others in controlling both soil, nutrient and organic matter loss in the soil.

40|$|The role of clathrin in {{intracellular}} sorting {{was investigated}} by {{expression of a}} dominant-negative mutant form of clathrin, termed the hub fragment. Hub inhibition of clathrin-mediated membrane transport was established by demonstrating a block of transferrin internalization and an alteration in the intracellular distribution of the cation-independent mannose- 6 -phosphate receptor. Hubs {{had no effect on}} uptake of FITC-dextran, adaptor distribution, organelle integrity in the secretory pathway, or cell surface expression of constitutively secreted molecules. Hub expression blocked lysosomal delivery of chimeric molecules containing either the tyrosine-based sorting signal of H 2 M or the dileucine-based sorting signal of CD 3 γ, confirming a role for clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) in recognizing these signals and sorting them to the endocytic pathway. Hub expression was then used to probe the role of CCVs in targeting native molecules bearing these sorting signals in the context of HLA–DM and the invariant chain (I chain) complexed to HLA–DR. The distribution of these molecules was differentially affected. Accumulation of hubs before expression of the DM dimer blocked DM export from the TGN, whereas hubs had no effect on direct targeting of the DR–I chain complex from the TGN to the endocytic pathway. However, concurrent expression of hubs, such that hubs were building to inhibitory concentrations during DM or DR–I chain expression, caused cell surface accumulation of both complexes. These observations suggest that both DM and DR–I chain <b>are</b> <b>directly</b> <b>transported</b> <b>to</b> the endocytic pathway from the TGN, DM in CCVs, and DR–I chain independent of CCVs. Subsequently, both complexes can appear at the cell surface from where they are both internalized by CCVs. Differential packaging in CCVs in the TGN, mediated by tyrosine- and dileucine-based sorting signals, could be a mechanism for functional segregation of DM from DR–I chain until their intended rendezvous in late endocytic compartments...|$|E
30|$|It {{is assumed}} that the customers' demand is stock {{dependent}} and selling price dependent for the perfect quality items and less perfect items, respectively. Since the storage space of the showroom for perfect quality items is limited due to space problem and the demand of the corresponding items is stock dependent, hence a secondary warehouse is hired by the retailer on rental basis to store the excess amount of perfect quality items and these items are continuously transferred to the showroom concerned. The literature suggests that the holding cost of secondary warehouse per unit item per unit time {{is more than the}} holding cost of the showroom due to the preservation cost for maintaining the quality of the product and other costs related to holding large quantity of the product in the secondary warehouse. But in this paper, it has been considered that the holding cost of perfect quality items in the secondary warehouse is less than the holding cost of the showroom as the nature of the items are non-deteriorating and so having no preservation cost. The perfect quality items are transported to the showroom via secondary warehouse, and the less perfect quality items <b>are</b> <b>directly</b> <b>transported</b> <b>to</b> the related showroom. For this purpose, transportation cost is incurred to transport both quality items at the respective showrooms from the production center. Due to complexity of environment, inventory holding costs, idle costs, set-up costs, and transportation costs are considered as fuzzy rough type and these are reduced to crisp ones using fuzzy rough expectation. In order to optimize the production rate and raw material order size (the decision variables), the average profit function of the manufacturer is maximized as the manufacturer acts as a leader (Stakelberg approach), and the supplier as well as retailer are the followers of that chain. The decision variables are also optimized by maximizing the integrated average profit function of the chain. Finally, a comparative study has been made between both Stakelberg and integrated approaches. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the feasibility of the model.|$|E
40|$|Introduction Several {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that severely injured patients should be transported directly to a trauma centre bypassing the nearest hospital. However, the evidence remains inconclusive. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the benefits in terms of mortality of direct transport to a trauma centre versus primary treatment in a level II or III centre followed by inter hospital transfer to a trauma centre for severely injured patients without Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). Patients and methods We used the regional trauma registry and included all patients with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) > 15 and an Abbreviated Injury Score < 4 for head injury. We adjusted for survival bias by including “potential transfers”: patients who died at the nearest hospitals before transportation to a trauma centre. Results A total of 439 patients was included. The majority of patients (349 / 439, 79 %) was transported directly to the level I trauma centre (direct group). The transferred group was formed by the remaining 90 patients, of whom 81 were transferred to the level I trauma centre after initial stabilisation elsewhere and 9 patients died in the emergency room before transfer to a level 1 trauma centre could occur. There were no significant differences in baseline and injury characteristics between the groups. Overall, 60 patients died in-hospital including 41 of the 349 patients (12 %) in the direct group and 19 of the 90 patients (21 %) in the transferred group. Nine of the 19 deaths in the transferred group were ascribed to potential transfers. After adjusting for prehospital Revised Trauma Score (RTS) and ISS, the odds ratio of death was 2. 40 (95 %CI: 1. 07 – 5. 40) for patients in the transfer group. When potential transfer patients were excluded from the analysis, the adjusted odds ratio of death was 1. 14 (95 %CI: 0. 43 – 3. 01). Conclusions After adjusting for survivor bias by including potential transfers, the results of this study suggest a lower risk of death for patients who <b>are</b> <b>directly</b> <b>transported</b> <b>to</b> a level I trauma centre than for patients who receive primary treatment in a level II or III centre and are transferred to a trauma centre. However, this finding was only significant when adjusting for survival bias and therefore we conclude that it is still uncertain if there is a lower risk of death for patients who are transported directly to a level I trauma centre.

Thus, immature CD 1 e includes an N-terminal propeptide which is cleaved in acidic compartment and so, absent on the mature endosomal form. Mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that the propeptide controls the assembly of the CD 1 e α chain with β 2 -microglobulin while propeptide-deleted CD 1 e molecules are immunologically active.

50|$|Unlike the {{invertebrates}} groups mentioned so far, {{insects are}} usually terrestrial, and exchange gases across a moist surface in {{direct contact with}} the atmosphere, rather than in contact with surrounding water. The insect's exoskeleton is impermeable to gases, including water vapor, so they have a more specialised gas exchange system, requiring gases <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>directly</b> <b>transported</b> <b>to</b> the tissues via a complex network of tubes. This respiratory system is separated from their circulatory system. Gases enter and leave the body through openings called spiracles, located laterally along the thorax and abdomen. Similar to plants, insects are able to control the opening and closing of these spiracles, but instead of relying on turgor pressure, they rely on muscle contractions. These contractions result in an insect's abdomen being pumped in and out. The spiracles are connected to tubes called tracheae, which branch repeatedly and ramify into the insect's body. These branches terminate in specialised tracheole cells which provides a thin, moist surface for efficient gas exchange, directly with cells.|$|R

VEGF accumulated at β 1 integrin containing fibrillar adhesions and was translocated along the cell surface prior to internalization and degradation. We also found that only the astrocyte-derived, matrix-bound, and not soluble VEGF decreases β 1 integrin turnover in fibrillar adhesions. We suggest that polarized VEGF release and ECM remodeling by VEGF secreting cells is key to control the local concentration and signaling of VEGF. Our findings highlight the importance of astrocytes in directing VEGF functions and identify these mechanisms as promising target for angiogenic approaches. GLIA 2016; 64 : 440 - 456...|$|R

When these mutant and chimeric proteins were expressed in stably transfected polarized MDCK cells, the transmembrane domain of NA, and not the cytoplasmic tail, provided a determinant for apical targeting in polarized MDCK cells and this transmembrane signal was sufficient for sorting and transport of the ectodomain of a reporter protein (transferrin receptor) directly to the apical plasma membrane of polarized MDCK cells. In addition, by using differential detergent extraction, we demonstrated that influenza virus NA and the chimeras which were <b>transported</b> <b>to</b> the apical plasma membrane also became insoluble in Triton X- 100 but soluble in octylglucoside after extraction from MDCK cells during exocytic transport.

Similar nuclear accumulation of endogenous C-terminal fragments was observed not only in C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 cells but also in mouse embryonic primary cells.

Our results show that more than 80 % of the total sediment production in the catchment has been stored as colluvium (mostly generated by hillslope erosion), while almost 13 % is stored in the floodplain since the High Middle Ages (this situation resembles a capacity-limited system).

Virol. 70 : 6508 – 6515, 1996). In this report, we have analyzed the sequences in the NA TMD involved in apical transport and raft association by making chimeric TMDs from NA and human transferring receptor (TR) TMDs and by mutating the NA TMD sequences. Our {{results show that the}} COOH-terminal half of the NA TMD (amino acids [aa] 19 to 35) was significantly involved in raft association, as determined by Triton X- 100 (TX- 100) resistance. However, in addition, the highly conserved residues at the extreme NH 2 terminus of the NA TMD were also critical for TX- 100 resistance. On the other hand, 19 residues (aa 9 to 27) at the NH 2 terminus of the NA TMD were sufficient for apical sorting. Amino acid residues 14 to 18 and 27 to 31 had the least effect on apical transport, whereas mutations in the amino acid residues 11 to 13, 23 to 26, and 32 to 35 resulted in altered polarity for the mutant proteins. These results indicated that multiple regions in the NA TMD were involved in apical transport. Furthermore, these results support the idea that the signals for apical sorting and raft association, although residing in the NA TMD, are not identical and vary independently and that the NA TMD also possesses an apical determinant(s) which can interact with apical sorting machineries outside the lipid raft...|$|R

40|$|Demand for Electricity {{has been}} {{increasing}} rapidly {{over the last decade}} and the cost of electricity generation too {{has been increasing}} due to the adverse impacts on hydro resources. Electricity loss reduction is a main concern to minimize the heavy cost on electricity generation. It has shown progress {{over the last five years}} by minimizing system losses by 5 %. Embedded generation has direct impact on the distribution loss level of the system due to the alteration in power flow. Absorption of the optimal output of the potentially available embedded generation is therefore important for the utility. It needs adequate facilitation for the developers and optimal allocation of these plants on the network. Network analysis was carried out on a network in actual terms. Power flow study through Synergee software considering various arrangements of grid interconnection of embedded generators, was the approach. Key concerns on the simulation study was the reduction in distribution line losses, reduction in grid power demand where central generation replaced by embedded generation and the reduction in grid transformer losses due to altered current flows. The study consisted of analyzing the absorption of all potentially available capacity into the feeder. The optimal arrangement was compared with the conventional arrangement proposed by CEB thereby evaluating the profitability of the modified connection arrangement through NPV calculation. Analysis revealed that connecting the embedded generators to the nearby load centers of the network has significant effect compared to connecting them to nearest branch of the distributor. It causes' a reduction in network losses and cost of generation due to the decrease in power demand by the transmission network. The effect is high when power from large capacity generators <b>is</b> <b>directly</b> <b>transported</b> <b>to</b> the load centers.

However, computations on a long time-scale show unrealistic predictions of the bottom development near the waterline. In a numerical model (e. g. Delft 3 D-MOR) the waterline is a discontinuity. The model stops computing transports just seawards of the waterline; after this, on the dry beach, transports are zero. In reality, sand will be transported from the dunes to the surf zone in a situation of erosion. Because this transport does not occur in the numerical model, a "hole" develops in front ofthe waterline. Because of the scour hole, too little wave energy is dissipated and there is still wave energy at the last point seaward of the waterline. Less and less dissipation and associated transports take place in the model, so the erosion process stops too soon. The aim of this study is then, to develop a model, applicable within Delft 3 D-MOR, that describes the sediment exchange between the surf zone and the dry beach and dunes. The model that is applied in Delft 3 D-MOR, searches the whole modelled area for situations where a wet and active cell neighbours a dry and inactive cell. At this point the sediment extrapolation approach of Steetzel is used. In this model the deposited sediment on the beach in an accretion situation <b>is</b> assumed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>directly</b> <b>transported</b> <b>to</b> the higher parts of the profile. The model boundaries are at the last active/wet cell and the first top in cross-shore direction. The overall conclusion from the four used test cases is, that the adaption of the dry bed transports is successful and allows the exchange of sediment between the surf zone and the dry areas. However, the modelling of the transport processes under water is still rather inaccurate. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

However, it is still beneficial to maintain a connection between the donor eNB and the RN, which uses very few radio resources, in order to enable the RN to switch back to the [...] "normal RN" [...] mode when enough radio resources become available for the backhaul.|$|R
