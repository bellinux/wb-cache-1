5|$|In <b>a</b> <b>revision</b> <b>of</b> basal Dinosauria, Padian and May (1993) {{discussed}} {{the definition of}} the clade, and redefined it as the latest common ancestor of Triceratops and birds. They also discussed what this definition would do to the most basal taxa, such as Herrerasauridae, and Eoraptor. Padian and May considered that since both Herrerasauridae and Eoraptor lack many diagnostic features of Saurischia or Ornithischia, that they could not be considered inside Dinosauria.|$|E

5|$|The {{species is}} {{currently}} regarded as monotypic. Three varieties of Ficus obliqua were recognised until 2001—F. obliqua var. petiolaris, F. obliqua var. obliqua, and F. obliqua var. puberula from Western Australia. <b>A</b> <b>revision</b> <b>of</b> the group {{led to the}} conclusion that F. obliqua var. petiolaris belonged in the species F. rubiginosa. F. obliqua var. puberula was found to be more distantly related to obliqua than rubiginosa and hence has been reclassified as a separate species, Ficus brachypoda.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Pei {{designed}} a new museum for Luxembourg, the Musée d'art moderne Grand-Duc Jean, {{commonly known as}} the Mudam. Drawing from the original shape of the Fort Thüngen walls where the museum was located, Pei planned to remove a portion of the original foundation. Public resistance to the historical loss forced <b>a</b> <b>revision</b> <b>of</b> his plan, however, and the project was nearly abandoned. The size of the building was halved, and it was set back from the original wall segments to preserve the foundation. Pei was disappointed with the alterations, but remained involved in the building process even during construction.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilia and Crocodylia {{have been}} used interchangeably for decades {{starting}} with Schmidt's redescription of the group from the formerly defunct term Loricata. Schmidt used the older term Crocodilia, based on Owen's original name for the group. Shortly after, Wermuth opted for Crocodylia as the proper name for this redescribed group, basing it on the type genus Crocodylus (Laurenti, 1768). Dundee—in <b>a</b> <b>revision</b> <b>of</b> many reptilian and amphibian names—argued strongly for Crocodylia to be the spelling for the group. However, {{it was not until}} the advent of cladistics and phylogenetic nomenclature that a more solid justification for assuming one spelling over the other was proposed.|$|E

5|$|His {{best known}} popular work is his Dictionary of Plant Names, which {{found its way}} into the {{libraries}} of most horticulturalists. One of the focuses of his work at the Natural History Museum was the flora of the Caribbean, where he carried out field work. Stearn continued to return to the Cambridge Botanic Garden, cared for his own garden and worked with the RHS to become an authority on horticulture as well as botany. William Stearn collaborated with his wife, Eldwyth Ruth Stearn, on a number of his most important works, including Botanical Latin and Dictionary of Plant Names and translating German botanical history into English. Just before his death he completed <b>a</b> <b>revision</b> <b>of</b> his original Epimedium monograph.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Eva Verena Bärmann (of the University of Cambridge) {{and colleagues}} {{undertook}} <b>a</b> <b>revision</b> <b>of</b> the phylogeny {{of the tribe}} Antilopini {{on the basis of}} nuclear and mitochondrial data. They showed that the springbok and the gerenuk (Litocranius walleri) form a clade with saiga (Saiga tatarica) as sister taxon. The study pointed out that the saiga and the springbok could be considerably {{different from the rest of}} the antilopines; a 2007 phylogenetic study even suggested that the two form a clade sister to the gerenuk. The cladogram below is based on the 2013 study.|$|E
5|$|In 973–975, Abu Taghlib {{supported}} Bakhtiyar {{in his own}} {{struggles to}} safeguard his power. Thus he once again marched on Baghdad during the rebellion of the Turkish military commander, Sabuktakin, although it was {{the intervention of the}} Buyid emir of Shiraz, 'Adud al-Dawla, that decided the conflict for Bakhtiyar. As a result of his assistance, in 975 Abu Taghlib secured <b>a</b> <b>revision</b> <b>of</b> the earlier treaty which freed him from the payment of tribute. In 976, following the death of Tzimiskes, Abu Taghlib agreed to support the bid for the Byzantine throne of the rebel general Bardas Skleros, with whom he concluded a treaty whereby the Hamdanid ruler supplied Skleros with light cavalry in exchange for an unspecified marriage agreement.|$|E

It amended {{the process for}} interim {{appointments}} of U.S. Attorneys, a clause Specter wrote during his chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The change allowed the Bush Administration to appoint interim U.S. attorneys without term limits, and without confirmation by the Senate. The Bush administration used the law to place at least eight interim attorneys into office in 2006. Specter claimed that the changes were added by staff member Brett Tolman.

5|$|Released in , {{four years}} after the launch of the {{original}} PlayStation 2, the PlayStation 2 Slimline was the first major redesign of the PlayStation 2. Compared to its predecessor, the Slimline was smaller, thinner, quieter and also included a built-in Ethernet port (in some markets it also has an integrated modem). In , Sony began shipping <b>a</b> <b>revision</b> <b>of</b> the Slimline which was lighter than the original Slimline together with a lighter AC adapter. In , Sony released yet another revision of the Slimline which had an overhauled internal design incorporating the power supply into the console itself like the original PlayStation 2 resulting in a further reduced total weight of the console.|$|E
5|$|The Cargador del Ancestro ("Ancestor Carrier") {{consists}} of four fragments of sculpture that had been reused in the facades of four different buildings during {{the latter part of}} the Late Preclassic. Monuments 215 and 217 were discovered in 2008 during excavations of Structure 7A, while Stela Fragments 53 and 61 had been unearthed in previous excavations. Archaeologists discovered that although Monuments 215 and 217 possessed different themes and were executed in differing styles, they in fact fitted together perfectly to form part of a single sculpture that was still incomplete. This prompted <b>a</b> <b>revision</b> <b>of</b> previously found sculpture fragments and resulted in the discovery of two further pieces, originally found in Structures 12 and 74.|$|E

5|$|The now {{independent}} association maintained the racial segregation with four separate associations. After consultation with Baden-Powell, four separate Scouting organisations {{were created in}} 1936. These were The Boy Scouts Association (for whites), The African Boy Scouts Association (for blacks), The Coloured Boy Scouts Association (for coloureds) and The Indian Boy Scouts Association (for Indians). <b>A</b> <b>revision</b> <b>of</b> the 1936 constitution in 1953 even strengthened the whites-only branch: its Chief Scout was now Chief Scout of the three other associations, with each association providing a Chief Scout's Commissioner as executive head under the Chief Scout.|$|E
5|$|The only {{objection}} is, {{not that}} the Court acted beyond its jurisdiction, but that it erred in its judgment of the law applicable to the case. If, then, we are to give any relief in this case, it is by <b>a</b> <b>revision</b> <b>of</b> {{the opinion of the}} Court, given {{in the course of a}} criminal trial, and thus asserting a right to control its proceedings, and take from them the conclusive effect which the law intended to give them. If this were an application for a habeas corpus, after judgment on an indictment for an offence within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, it could hardly be maintained, that this court could revise such a judgment, or the proceedings which led to it, or set it aside, and discharge the prisoner.|$|E
