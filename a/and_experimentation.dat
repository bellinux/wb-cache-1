It was later known as Troop Leader Development; the final Troop Leadership Development Staff Guide, written by John W. Larson, credited White Stag with its origins.|$|E
5|$|Retrospectively, Nimrod {{is noted}} for its musical {{diversity}} <b>and</b> <b>experimentation.</b> It contains elements of folk, surf rock, and ska; the lyrical themes discussed on the record include maturity, personal reflection, and fatherhood.|$|E
5|$|Two French-made s were {{commissioned}} in 1928–1929. Both were {{captured by the}} Italians during the April 1941 invasion, after which they were put into service as training <b>and</b> <b>experimentation</b> boats under new names. They were both scuttled {{at the time of}} the Italian capitulation.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 960 sorties {{had been made}} during the trials, {{including}} 1,366 takeoffs and landings, {{by the end of}} evaluations in November 1965. One aircraft was destroyed in an accident and six others were transferred to the United States, assigned the US designation XV-6A Kestrel, and underwent further testing. The two remaining British-based Kestrels were assigned to further trials <b>and</b> <b>experimentation</b> at RAE Bedford with one being modified to use the uprated Pegasus 6 engine.|$|E
5|$|Coexist {{features}} a minimalist musical style with spatial arrangements, loose song structure, little dynamism, <b>and</b> <b>experimentation</b> with tension. Its songs are characterised by sparse {{elements such as}} simple chord progression, keyboard ostinatos, and fading motifs, while Smith's production incorporates both programmed beats and live percussion instruments. Coexist touches on themes of heartbreak, loneliness, and intimacy. The lyrics, written by guitarist Romy Madley Croft and bassist Oliver Sim, address a failing relationship and changes in a romance with inner monologues and simple metaphors.|$|E
5|$|First of the class, Osvetnik was {{involved}} in a series of visits to Mediterranean ports during the interwar period. She was captured in port by the Italians during the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia. She was refitted and modernised before being commissioned by the Italians as Francesco Rismondo, but was only used for training <b>and</b> <b>experimentation.</b> After the Italian surrender, she was captured then scuttled by the Germans in September 1943.|$|E

5|$|Smeli was {{the second}} and last of her class. She also participated in several cruises in the Mediterranean during the interwar period. After capture by the Italians, Smeli was {{refitted}} and modernised before being commissioned as Antonio Bajamonti, but was only used for training <b>and</b> <b>experimentation.</b> She was scuttled by the Italians in September 1943 after the Italian surrender.|$|E
5|$|The Wood Badge {{course was}} pilot-tested still further in 1971 at Philmont, the five test councils, {{and in every}} {{national}} region excepting Region 8. In 1972, after five long years of testing <b>and</b> <b>experimentation,</b> the official new Wood Badge Staff Guide was published. The program was mandated for nationwide implementation and included {{for the first time}} teaching leadership skills over Scoutcraft skills.|$|E
5|$|The {{music of}} So Beautiful or So What {{features}} West African blues-inspired guitar playing, Indian-style percussion, <b>and</b> <b>experimentation</b> with samples, which ranged from {{an excerpt from}} a 1941 sermon to nighttime ambience in Kenya. The songs were recorded with little bass but with a very large presence of bells. Much of Simon's lyrics touch on themes of spirituality and mortality, which Simon said was unintentional and resulted naturally in his songwriting process for the album.|$|E
50|$|Research <b>and</b> <b>experimentations</b> {{lead to a}} derived {{method for}} {{one-to-one}} Legoviews - LSP interviews that has been developed in 2011 by P. Bertini and widely tested in several environments, i.e. Palestine, Israel, Occupy London, with filmmakers, artists, activists. Most interviews are published on the London Progressive Journal.|$|R

5|$|Blitz {{participated in}} {{extensive}} training <b>and</b> <b>experimentation</b> in the Torpedo School, {{under the command}} of Alfred von Tirpitz, the future architect of the High Seas Fleet. In 1889, Pfeil was sent to German East Africa to participate in the suppression of a local revolt against German colonial rule. By 1899, both ships were withdrawn from front line service; Pfeil was used for fishery protection, and Blitz became a fleet tender. In 1912, both Blitz and Pfeil were serving as tenders to the I Battle Squadron and the II Battle Squadron, respectively. At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Blitz was mobilized as a coastal patrol ship, while Pfeil remained a tender. Blitz returned to her tender duties in 1915. Both ships were sold for scrapping in the early 1920s.|$|E
5|$|In early 1988, Butthole Surfers {{were ready}} to record a new album and wanted to use a modern studio for the first time, {{choosing}} a state-of-the-art facility in Texas. The following sessions took only one week, as the band had been performing most of the material for years. The band opted to follow this album's blueprint on future projects. In contrast, songs on their earlier recordings had undergone far more in-studio development <b>and</b> <b>experimentation.</b> Pinkus has expressed the opinion that the later, better-organized sessions stifled much of the spontaneous creativity that had propelled their earlier releases.|$|E
5|$|P. rebeli live in {{different}} habitats; therefore, {{they do not}} parasitize the same Myrmica ant species. Through observation <b>and</b> <b>experimentation,</b> researchers found that if P. rebeli try to parasitize a different Myrmica ant species than the one they normally do, the Myrmica ants will identify the P. rebeli larvae as intruders and will kill 100% of the P. rebeli larvae. The differences between the P. rebeli are that they synthesize different hydrocarbons, which allow them to mimic different species of Myrmica ants. This explains why they have no success in being mistaken for another species of Myrmica ant and the ensuing 100% mortality rate when the other Myrmica ant species is not fooled.|$|E

5|$|PETA {{took on the}} Pokémon {{series with}} Pokémon Black and Blue, a parody of Pokémon Black and White that focuses on animal {{fighting}} <b>and</b> <b>experimentation.</b> In role-playing-style battles, the player controls a Pikachu who escapes its Trainers, Cheren. Pikachu first fights Cheren and then moves on to other Trainers in order to rescue their Pokémon from ownership. Pikachu recruits these Pokémon to its cause, {{as well as the}} sympathetic Nurse Joy. A sequel, Pokémon Red, White, and Blue, followed in 2013. The game suggests that Nintendo's continual releases of Pokémon games reduce humans' empathy for animals. Also a role-playing game, it stars Pikachu and Miltank, who battle McDonald's characters like the Hamburglar in a crusade against the rare but ongoing practice of meat production in the Unova region.|$|E
5|$|Prior to World War II she {{participated in}} several cruises to Mediterranean ports. During the German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, she {{was captured by}} Italian forces at the Bay of Kotor. Initially designated N1, her armament was changed and her conning tower modified. Due to her age and shallow diving depth, when she was commissioned into the Royal Italian Navy as Francesco Rismondo her service was limited to training <b>and</b> <b>experimentation.</b> She was scuttled off the island of Corsica by the Germans shortly after her capture in September 1943 following the Italian surrender.|$|E
5|$|The Guthrie Theater, {{opened in}} 1963, was {{the brainchild of}} Sir Tyrone Guthrie, who wanted to found a {{regional}} theater without the commercial constraints of Broadway. The high cost of staging Broadway productions meant that shows had to be immediately successful and return a high amount of revenue. This discouraged innovation <b>and</b> <b>experimentation,</b> and made it difficult to stage important works of literature. These ideas were first disseminated in a 1959 article in the drama section of the New York Times, and citizens in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area were eager to support the idea. The theater served as a prototype for other resident non-profit theaters.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea that}} matter {{is made up}} of {{discrete}} units is a very old one, appearing in many ancient cultures such as Greece and India. However, these ideas were founded in philosophical and theological reasoning rather than evidence <b>and</b> <b>experimentation.</b> Because of this, they could not convince everybody, so atomism was but {{one of a number of}} competing theories on the nature of matter. It was not until the 19th century that the idea was embraced and refined by scientists, as the blossoming science of chemistry produced discoveries that could easily be explained using the concept of atoms.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} few years, the new regime optimistically engaged in reform <b>and</b> <b>experimentation</b> {{and for the first}} time many Poles could afford to buy cars, {{televisions}} and other consumer goods. The authorities made sure that the workers received proper wages. The peasants had their compulsory deliveries abolished, were paid higher prices for their products and free health service was finally extended to rural, self-employed Poland. The intellectuals had censorship eased and Poles were able to travel to the West and maintain foreign contacts with little difficulty. Relations with the Polish emigrant communities were strengthened. There was some cultural and political relaxation and an improved freedom of speech environment, exercised for example by the respected weekly Polityka of the Polish party. Massive investments were made, expected to both improve the standard of living of the various segments of society and establish an internationally competitive Polish industry and agriculture, based on purchases of Western technology. The modernized manufacturing would result in a vastly expanded export of Polish-made products to the West, which in turn would generate hard currency to pay-off the debts.|$|E
5|$|Putnam himself {{may be his}} own most {{formidable}} philosophical adversary. His frequent changes of mind have led him to attack his previous positions. However, many significant criticisms of his views have come from other philosophers and scientists. For example, multiple realizability has been criticized on the grounds that, if it were true, research <b>and</b> <b>experimentation</b> in the neurosciences would be impossible. According to William Bechtel and Jennifer Mundale, {{to be able to}} conduct such research in the neurosciences, universal consistencies must either exist or be assumed to exist in brain structures. It is the similarity (or homology) of brain structures that allows us to generalize across species. If multiple realizability were an empirical fact, results from experiments conducted on one species of animal (or one organism) would not be meaningful when generalized to explain the behavior of another species (or organism of the same species). Other criticisms of metaphysical realism have been proposed by Jaegwon Kim, David Lewis, Robert Richardson and Patricia Churchland.|$|E
