5|$|An {{additional}} Iraqi column {{crossed the}} Saudi border to the East, although still along the coast, towards {{the city of}} Khafji. These Iraqi tanks were screened by the 5th Mechanized Battalion of the 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade. This battalion withdrew when it came under heavy fire, {{as it had been}} ordered to not engage the Iraqi column. Elements of the 8th and 10th Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigades <b>also</b> <b>conducted</b> similar screening operations. Due to the order to not engage, the road to Khafji was left open. At one point, Iraqi T-55s of another column rolled up to the Saudi border, signaling that they intended to surrender. As they were approached by Saudi Arabian troops, they reversed their turrets and opened fire. This prompted air support from a nearby AC-130, destroying 13 vehicles.|$|E

5|$|Anti-malware {{researchers}} also exploited Heartbleed {{to their own}} advantage in order to access secret forums used by cybercriminals. Studies were <b>also</b> <b>conducted</b> by deliberately setting up vulnerable machines. For example, on April 12, 2014, at least two independent researchers were able to steal private keys from an experimental server intentionally set up for that purpose by CloudFlare. Also, on April 15, 2014, J. Alex Halderman, a professor at University of Michigan, reported that his honeypot server, an intentionally vulnerable server designed to attract attacks in order to study them, had received numerous attacks originating from China. Halderman concluded that {{because it was a}} fairly obscure server, these attacks were probably sweeping attacks affecting large areas of the Internet.|$|E
5|$|As little {{opposition}} was expected at Morotai, Allied planners decided {{to land the}} invasion force close to the airfield sites on the Doroeba Plain. Two beaches in the south-west coast of the island were selected as suitable landing sites, and were designated Red Beach and White Beach. The Allied plan called for all three infantry regiments of the 31st Division to be landed across these beaches on 15 September and swiftly drive inland to secure the plain. As Morotai's interior had no military value, the Allies {{did not intend to}} advance beyond a perimeter needed to defend the airfields. Planning for the construction of airfields and other base installations was <b>also</b> <b>conducted</b> prior to the landing, and tentative locations for these facilities had been selected by 15 September.|$|E

He conducted the premiere in 1902 and in gratitude the work was dedicated to him. Messager <b>also</b> <b>conducted</b> the premieres of Massenet's Grisélidis and Charpentier's Louise. As a conductor, he won praise from critics {{on both sides of}} the English Channel. The English music critic Francis Toye wrote that good though Arturo Toscanini's conducting of Pelléas et Mélisande was at La Scala in Milan, Messager's was still better.|$|E
5|$|During Operation Inmate, Task Group 111.2's {{aircraft}} flew 103 offensive sorties {{during daylight}} and a further 10 at night. A total of 103 defensive sorties were <b>also</b> <b>conducted.</b> In {{addition to the}} Seafire shot down on 14 June {{and the loss of}} Rulers Walrus, five Avengers were destroyed due to accidents while taking off; one of these aircraft crashed into the sea due to an error in attaching it to Implacables catapult, resulting in the death of its pilot. The other four Avengers ditched due to engine malfunctions, with no fatalities. Two Seafires, both piloted by the same airman, were also damaged in landing accidents. A book published to mark the 50th anniversary of the BPF described these losses as low by the standards of 1945.|$|E
5|$|During a {{thorough}} study, the national BSA staff interviewed participants, parents, and leaders. They distributed questionnaires to program participants, reviewed the White Stag literature, and observed {{the program in}} action. They <b>also</b> <b>conducted</b> a statistical analysis of troops taking part in White Stag and compared them to non-participating units. In December 1965, Chief Scout Executive Joseph Brunton received the White Stag Report. It stated that offering leadership development to youth was a unique opportunity for Scouting to provide a practical benefit to youth and would add substantial support to Scouting's character development goals. It recommended that Wood Badge {{should be used to}} experiment with the leadership development principles of White Stag. The program had until this time taught the adults the same Scoutcraft skills a boy was required to learn to become a First Class Scout along with concepts of the patrol method.|$|E
