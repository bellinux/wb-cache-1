5|$|An {{order is}} a legal {{instrument}} that has an executive flavour and expresses <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> command. Often, its effect {{is limited to a}} particular moment in time, rather than continuing.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} pathology was {{noticed by}} Parks, and {{from around the}} notch. In the fourth, fifth, and sixth vertebrae, directly anterior to the notch, the neural spines were damaged. The fourth had <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> fracture, {{with the other two}} possessing a swelling {{at the base of the}} break.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} highway does {{not enter the}} City of Toronto proper, Toronto {{is used as a}} control city in Halton and Durham Regions due to the similar sizes of the {{suburban}} municipalities the highway passes through making selection of <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> example among them difficult.|$|E

5|$|Margaret, by now {{seven years}} of age, sailed from Norway for Scotland {{in the autumn of}} 1290, but fell ill on the way and died in Orkney. This left the country without <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> heir, and led to the {{succession}} dispute known to history as the Great Cause.|$|E
5|$|The hubs of orb webs, {{where the}} spiders lurk, are usually above the center, as the spiders can move {{downwards}} faster than upwards. If there is <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> {{direction in which}} the spider can retreat to avoid its own predators, the hub is usually offset towards that direction.|$|E
5|$|As noted, {{there is}} bonebed {{evidence}} that this genus lived in groups during {{at least part of}} the year. Additionally, it had several potential methods for display in a social setting. The bony facial crest is <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> candidate, and nasal diverticula may also have been present. These postulated diverticula would have taken the form of inflatable soft-tissue sacs housed in the deep excavations flanking the crest and elongate holes for the nostrils. Such sacs could be used for both visual and auditory signals.|$|E

50|$|Electric {{overhead}} traveling crane: EOT crane {{is one of}} {{the most}} common types of overhead crane, or called bridge cranes, which consist of parallel runways with a traveling bridge spanning the gap. <b>As</b> <b>obvious</b> from the name, EOT crane is operate by electric, generally there is an operator cabin or a control pendant along with the EOT crane.|$|R

5|$|Augustus {{bestowed}} only {{properties and}} possessions to his designated heirs, as <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> system of institutionalized imperial inheritance would have provoked resistance and hostility among the republican-minded Romans fearful of monarchy. With {{regards to the}} Principate, {{it was obvious to}} Augustus that Marcellus was not ready to take on his position; nonetheless, by giving his signet ring to Agrippa, Augustus intended to signal to the legions that Agrippa was to be his successor, and that constitutional procedure notwithstanding, they should continue to obey Agrippa.|$|E
5|$|Fighting colonial wars in Portuguese colonies {{had absorbed}} forty-four {{percent of the}} overall Portuguese budget. This led to <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> {{diversion}} of funds from necessary infrastructural developments in Portugal itself. This contributed to the growing unrest in the European nation. Portugal's GDP growth during the colonial war period (1961–1974), was strong and reached a 6% rate (a percentual GDP growth which were not achieved in any other comparable period after 1974).|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war in November 1918, the Regia Marina demobilized; {{severely}} reduced naval budgetsthe {{result of}} a weakened Italian economy in the early 1920sled to further draw-downs. Marsalas engines were plagued with problems throughout her career, which made the ship <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> target in the effort to trim the Regia Marinas budget. She was stricken from the naval register on 27 November 1927 and subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E

5|$|For {{her role}} in the film Sophie's Choice (1982), Streep spoke both English and German with a Polish accent, as well as Polish itself. In The Iron Lady, she {{reproduced}} the vocal style of Margaret Thatcher from the time before Thatcher became Britain's Prime Minister, and after she had taken elocution lessons to change her pitch, pronunciation, and delivery. Streep has commented that using accents as part of her acting is a technique she views as <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> requirement in her portrayal of a character.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of sound cinema, among the various {{distinguished}} composers ready to try their hand at film music, Prokofiev was not <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> choice for the commission. Based in Paris for almost a decade, he had a reputation for experimentation and dissonance, characteristics at odds with the cultural norms of the Soviet Union. By early 1933, however, Prokofiev was anxious to return to his homeland, and saw the film commission as an opportunity to write music in a more popular and accessible style.|$|E
5|$|Long-standing rivalries {{result in}} {{numerous}} rematches, especially {{if one of}} the enforcers has to decline an invitation to fight during a given game. This {{is one of the reasons}} that enforcers may fight at the beginning of a game, when nothing obvious has happened to agitate the opponents. On the other hand, it is bad etiquette to try to initiate a fight with an enforcer who is near the end of his shift, since the more rested player will have <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> advantage.|$|E
50|$|<b>As</b> <b>obvious</b> {{from the}} above mechanism, {{developing}} agent with very stable semiquinone radical form (the first oxidized form of the ETA) tends to make more superadditive combination. Also obvious {{from the above}} mechanism is that Agent 1 has to have an intermediate reduction potential in the developer solution between the Fermi energy level of silver (the developing image silver) and the reduction potential of Agent 2 in the developer solution.|$|R

5|$|Mass loss {{is one of}} {{the most}} intensively studied aspects of massive star research. Put simply, using {{observed}} mass loss rates in the best models of stellar evolution does not reproduce the observed properties of evolved massive stars such as Wolf–Rayets, the number and types of core collapse supernovae, or their progenitors. To match those observations, the models require much higher mass loss rates. Eta Carinae A has one of the highest known mass loss rates, currently around /year, and is <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> candidate for study.|$|E
5|$|On August 29th 2005, flood {{walls and}} levees catastrophically failed {{throughout}} the metro area. Many collapsed well below design thresholds (17th Street and London Canals). Others collapsed {{after a brief}} period of overtopping (Industrial Canal) caused “scouring” or erosion of the earthen levee walls. In eastern New Orleans, levees along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway failed in several places because they were built with sand and erodible materials instead of clay, <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> construction flaw.|$|E
5|$|Performing a chest {{radiograph}} {{is one of}} {{the first}} investigative steps if a person reports symptoms that may suggest lung cancer. This may reveal <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> mass, widening of the mediastinum (suggestive of spread to lymph nodes there), atelectasis (collapse), consolidation (pneumonia) or pleural effusion. CT imaging is typically used to provide more information about the type and extent of disease. Bronchoscopy or CT-guided biopsy is often used to sample the tumor for histopathology.|$|E

5|$|Romeo and Juliet is {{sometimes}} {{considered to have}} no unifying theme, save that of young love. Romeo and Juliet have become emblematic of young lovers and doomed love. Since it is such <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> subject of the play, several scholars have explored the language and historical context behind the romance of the play.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} the second crewman was <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> problem with the Mk. XII, {{especially}} as few bombers of the era had enough room for the operator. Working with Henry Braddick, Blackett developed {{a new version of}} the calculator that included aircraft instruments inside the computor, eliminating the {{need for the}} needle-on-needle matching and completely automating the calculations. After the initial design was complete, Blackett moved onto other matters with RAF Coastal Command, where he continued development of his theories of operational research.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{abnormalities}} may {{be categorized}} {{according to whether}} they have environmental or developmental causes. While environmental abnormalities may appear to have <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> cause, there may {{not appear to be}} any known cause for some developmental abnormalities. Environmental forces may affect teeth during development, destroy tooth structure after development, discolor teeth at any stage of development, or alter the course of tooth eruption. Developmental abnormalities most commonly affect the number, size, shape, and structure of teeth.|$|E

30|$|The tangent {{of major}} {{influence}} angle are basically between 2.51 and 3.40, {{which shows that}} the main surface deformation value is more concentrated, with a steep surface subsidence basin and there is <b>a</b> <b>obvious</b> difference of the subsidence curve at {{the two sides of}} the mining boundary pointing to the goaf, moreover, it is consistent with the field data, which can be mainly attributed to such factors as the rapid mining, the acceleration of the overburden subsidence velocity, the reduction of relative suspended time.|$|R
40|$|BexZn 1 -xO nanorod arrays {{with high}} {{crystalline}} quality were fabricated on Si substrate by a simple, low-cost hydrothermal method. The effect of Be-corporation on the structure, morphology and optical property of ZnO nanorod arrays was investigated. The diameter of BexZn 1 -xO nanorods gradually decreased {{and the length}} of them increased with increasing Be concentration. Edge emissions of the BexZn 1 -xO nanorods show <b>a</b> <b>obvious</b> blue shift upon the increase of the Be content. (C) 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinhei...|$|R
