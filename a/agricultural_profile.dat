The 1996 World Food Summit defined food security as ‘when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active healthy life’. Thus food security is largely multi-factorial and defined by context. Australia and New Zealand both have substantial <b>agricultural</b> <b>profiles</b> and there is a significant production in meat and livestock, dairy and grains from the region. Both countries are islands, surrounded by oceans with extensive fisheries, bearing in mind that the local ecology will reflect the type of fish that are available. Meeting dietary needs and food preferences in this context would mean taking into account the health profiles of the population and how these relate to the food that is available now and in the future. Layering in the effects of climate change means that the high prevalence of lifestyle related disease (obesity, heart disease, diabetes) and the vulnerability of at risk groups, particularly in remote communities in Australia, will require additional consideration...|$|R

40|$|Summary. Ensuring food {{security}} of Russia {{is one of}} the strategic tasks solved during sustainable social and economic development of national economy. The key role is played in this regard by processes of integration of the interfaced productions – subsystems of agro-industrial complex (agrarian and industrial complex). The modern directions of development of economic activity of the organizations of a food and <b>agricultural</b> <b>profile</b> to some extent already use integration advantages, however thus there are insufficiently balanced target interests of the interfaced participants of agro-industrial production that is directly or indirectly reflected in methods and instruments of organizational management. For mitigation of this situation and leveling of influence of factors of imbalance of management processes, it is offered to reform modern system of the business relations in agrarian and industrial complex on the basis of creation of the polycluster formations possessing the following key properties: territorial concentration of subjects; intra cluster competition; stability of economic relations; politsentrichnost; sona-pravlenny development of subjects; manifestation of a positive synergy. Considering these attributive lines of a cluster, methodological approach to creation of the agrofood polycluster formation (APF) is developed, using instruments of interindustry reengineering, in a beet sugar subsystem of agrarian and industrial complex. The aprioristic analysis and an assessment of conditions and a tendency of functioning of the interfaced participants of beet sugar production where negative consequences of the import substitution which is real threat of {{food security}} are most shown formed the basis for introduction of APF in this subsystem. As the characteristic of the content of the updated methodological approach to creation of APF the matrix of interface of target interests of subjects of a cluster in which structure are included is developed: state, cluster, sugar plants, beet-raising farms, seed-growing farms, research establishments, educational institutions, other organizations. The matrix diagonal visually shows an essence of two-uniform advantage of this type of APF: activation of processes of interface of target interests on the basis of self-development and integration of the knowledge accumulated by subjects of a cluster that in total allows to protect competitive advantages of a cluster at the intercluster level. Especially in the course of functioning of agrarian and industrial complex the assessment of pro-allowances of safety which is offered to carrying out hierarchically in the following sequence has importance: assessment of potential of ensuring industrially production safety with polycluster formation; cluster contribution assessment to achievement of industrial and production and food security...|$|E

Na području Koprivničko-križevačke županije, podzemna voda koristi se kao jedini izvor vode za piće pa je od iznimnog interesa spoznaja o koncentraciji nitrata s obzirom na mogućnost štetnog djelovanja na ljudsko zdravlje. Prema literaturi, prekomjerni unos nitrata u organizam može doprinijeti pojavnosti methemoglobinemije, tumora, spontanih abortusa te poremećaju intrauterinog rasta. U razdoblju od 2002. do 2007. godine na području Koprivničko-križevačke županije, uzorkovano je 1170 uzoraka vode za piće iz plitkih bunara u kojima je utvrđena koncentracija nitrata metodom ionske kromatografije (HRN EN ISO 10304 - 1 : 1998). Od svih ispitanih uzoraka, u 25 % (N= 294), utvrđena je koncentracija nitrata iznad maksimalno dopustive, propisane Pravilnikom o zdravstvenoj ispravnosti vode za piće. Na području Križevaca utvrđeno je 38 % (N= 382) neispravnih uzoraka u vodi za piće iz domaćinstava, na području Koprivnice 23 % (N= 613), dok je na području Đurđevca utvrđeno 6 % (N= 175) neispravnih uzoraka. U radu je dokazano onečišćenje pitke vode iz točkastih izvora poljoprivrednog porijekla. Utvrđena je pozitivna ili negativna korelacija između povišene koncentracije nitrata i količine oborina. Na području Koprivničko-križevačke županije postoje razlike u kvaliteti podzemne vode koje mogu biti posljedica i različitog intenziteta utjecaja poljoprivrede na onečišćenje vode. Aims: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{establish}} nitrate concentrations in drinking water originating from shallow wells across Koprivnica- Križevci County, to assess the influence of agricultural point sources on nitrate water contamination, and to explore the correlations between water nitrate concentrations and agro-ecologic factors. Methods: During the 2002 - 2007 period, a total of 1170 potable water samples were taken from 104 shallow wells across Koprivnica-Križevci County. Given the geographical and developmental determinants, the investigated area was divided into three sections: Koprivnica, Križevci and urđevac areas. Potable water was sampled throughout the 6 -year, all season-period conformant to the HRN ISO 5667 - 3 standard. Nitrate concentrations in potable water samples were established using ion chromatography (HRN EN ISO 10304 - 1 : 1998). The total amount of downfalls subsequently correlated to nitrate concentrations was determined by summing up individual metric values provided by the State Meteorological and Hydrological Service. Data were analyzed in a descriptive manner and compared to the maximal allowable concentrations (MAC) stipulated under the Ordinance on Potable Water Safety, as well as to the limit values recommended under the Nitrates Directive. The _ 2 -test produced statistically significant differences. Results: In 25 % (n= 294) of water samples, nitrate concentration exceeded MAC. The majority of unsafe samples were recovered in Križevci area (38 %; n= 382), followed by Koprivnica (23 %; n= 613) and urđevac area (6 %; n= 175). The mean range spanned from 0. 1 to 279. 0 mg/L, while the total mean nitrate concentration was 41. 7 mg/L. The highest mean nitrate concentration of 53. 9 mg/L was measured in Križevci area, followed by 38. 8 mg/L in Koprivnica and the lowest 24. 9 mg/L in urđevac area. Out of 75 % of safe water samples, the measured nitrate concentration was below 25 mg/L limit value recommended under the Directive in as much as 52 % of samples. Given the detected nitrate concentrations in the sampled well water, the wells were classified as satisfactory, occasionally unsatisfactory and unsatisfactory. The influence of point sources was assessed based on their distance. In roughly 50 % of samples taken from occasionally or definitely unsatisfactory wells, point sources were located up to 10 meters away, while in as much as 93 % of samples taken from satisfactory wells the point sources were situated over 20 meters away (p< 0. 01). For some of the wells, statistically significant positive (r= 0. 45 to 0. 87) or negative (r=- 0. 30 to - 0. 66) correlations between the amount of downfalls and nitrate concentrations were established, while in the third well group this correlation (r=- 0. 14 to - 0. 24) was lacking. Discussion and Conclusions: The results obtained are comparable to those of similar studies undertaken in regions having a similar agro-ecological and <b>agricultural</b> <b>profile.</b> Across the Koprivnica-Križevci County, differences in the underground water quality may arise as a consequence of water contamination due to distinctive agricultural activities. The range of the mean nitrate concentrations established in potable water samples recovered from shallow wells was wide; the total mean nitrate concentration was relatively high (41. 7 mg/L). The distribution of relative concentrations revealed 25 % of samples to have nitrate concentrations higher than MAC under the Ordinance. Spatial distribution revealed the majority of unsafe water samples to stem from Križevci area (38 %), consistent with the majority of large husbandries situated therein. Contaminating point sources located not farther than 10 meters from shallow wells significantly influence the quality of drawn water. Respective of correlations between the amount of downfalls and water nitrate concentrations, both negative and positive links were established...|$|E

30|$|Despite {{our efforts}} at {{standardization}} via trainings {{and characteristics of}} the AEAs, biases in data collected cannot be completely ruled out due to human errors or weakness from interviewer and/or respondents. That is the normal challenge as with almost all survey studies and therefore provision is usually made for margin of error. We addressed {{the extent to which}} interviewer bias may have influenced the results in two distinct ways. First, as discussed previously, interviewers were selected based on their experience and trained to minimize bias through a formal process as explained in the preceding subsection. Second, we conducted an exploratory analysis to determine if interviewers differed from one another on participants’ responses to key survey questions. Insofar as the interviewers were drawn from different agricultural operational areas, with each operational area representing a different <b>agricultural</b> type <b>profile,</b> we can assume, based on our findings that farmers who emphasize rain-fed approaches will differ from farmers who utilize irrigation techniques. To assess the likelihood that interviewers may have biased the results, we examine the extent to which interviewers have notably different responses for the same type or combination of farmers. An ANOVA and Tukey’s test were conducted for the two groups of farmers (rain-fed only and a mix of both rain-fed and irrigation) with respect to the various interviewers and key response variables to examine the possible differences in the responses between interviewers. An examination of Chi square tests for the agricultural type and practice variables was additionally conducted.|$|R

This enables comparisons of the efficiency of different farms and production systems and of alternative mitigation strategies across all gases. The standard metric is the 100 year global warming potential (GWP), but alternative metrics have been proposed and could result in very different CO 2 -equivalent emissions, particularly for CH 4. While significant effort {{has been made to}} reduce uncertainties in emissions estimates of individual gases, little effort has been spent on evaluating the implications of alternative metrics on overall <b>agricultural</b> emissions <b>profiles</b> and mitigation strategies. Here we assess, for a selection of New Zealand dairy farms, the effect of two alternative metrics (100 yr GWP and global temperature change potentials, GTP) on farm-scale emissions and apparent efficiency and cost effectiveness of alternative mitigation strategies. We find that alternative metrics significantly change the balance between CH 4 and N 2 O; in some cases, alternative metrics even determine whether a specific management option would reduce or increase net farm-level emissions or emissions intensity. However, the relative ranking of different farms by profitability or emissions intensity, and the ranking of the most cost-effective mitigation options for each farm, are relatively unaffected by the metric. We conclude that alternative metrics would change the perceived significance of individual gases from agriculture and the overall cost to farmers if a price were applied to agricultural emissions, but the economically most effective response strategies are unaffected by the choice of metric...|$|R

When these properties are described by parametric functions, subsurface heterogeneity can be quantified by variations in the parameters of these functions. We propose a procedure to characterize systematically the statistical properties of each soil hydraulic parameter and the parameter correlations First, the parameter with the best-defined probability distribution function (pdf) is identified. Curvilinear regression analysis identifies transformations that linearize the relationships between this reference parameter and the remaining parameters. From this we determine the joint pdf of the transformed parameters, which is then {{used to calculate the}} distributions of derived variates (functions of the hydraulic parameters). The procedure is applied to the hydraulic parameters of 140 samples in total taken from two layers of an <b>agricultural</b> soil <b>profile.</b> We developed analytical expressions for the pdfs of derived variates (hydraulic conductivities and water contents at heads between 0 and - 5000 cm) from the multivariate parameter pdf. The numerical integration required to evaluate these expressions proved extremely cumbersome, thus reducing the robustness of the analytical expressions. We therefore performed a Monte Carlo simulation from which we determined the first two moments, as well as the skewness and excess of the derived variates. The estimated mean and standard deviation of the derived variates generally agreed well with values determined directly from the soil samples. Skewness and excess were estimated less accurately. Both the derived analytical pdfs and the Monte Carlo simulation showed markedly nonsymmetrical pdfs, suggesting that it is generally insufficient to limit statistical to the first two moments only...|$|R

However, the use of inappropriate irrigation practices could result in a serious contamination risk to plants, soils, and groundwater with sewage water. This research was initiated in view to the increasing danger of vegetable crops and groundwater contamination with pathogenic bacteria due to wastewater land application. The research was designed to study: (1) the effect of treated wastewater irrigation on the yield and microbial contamination of the radish plant under field conditions; (2) contamination of the <b>agricultural</b> soil <b>profile</b> with fecal coliform bacteria. Effluent from a domestic wastewater treatment plant (100 %) in Jeddah city, Saudi Arabia, was diluted to 80 % and 40 % with the groundwater of the experimental site constituting three different water qualities plus groundwater as control. Radish plant was grown in two consecutive seasons under two drip irrigation systems and four irrigation water qualities. Upon harvesting, plant weight per ha, total bacterial, fecal coliform, fecal streptococci were detected per 100 g of dry matter and compared with the control. The soil profile was also sampled at an equal distance of 3 cm from soil surface for fecal coliform detection. The results indicated that the yield increased significantly under the subsurface irrigation system and the control water quality compared to surface irrigation system and other water qualities. There was a considerable drop in the count of all bacteria species under the subsurface irrigation system compared to surface irrigation. The bacterial count/g of the plant shoot system increased as the percentage of wastewater in the irrigation water increased. Most of the fecal coliform bacteria were deposited in the first few centimeters below the column inlet and the profile exponentially decreased with increasing depth...|$|R

In order to inform closer to reality, the design of the questionnaire sought to identify options for the University of Agronomic Sciences and Veterinary Medicine Bucharest, following the evaluation by the pupils, of the group of university education offers. Almost all, of 96. 7 % of pupils expressed their intention to continue their studies in the higher education, most of them continuing the tradition of the past years, to direct their options to the economic education, respectively 31 %. The school population was divided into five layers, depending on the number of graduates registered in the University of Agronomic Sciences and Veterinary Medicine Bucharest, in the academic year 2014 / 2015. The demand for the University of Agronomic Sciences and Veterinary Medicine Bucharest represents 27 % of the demand for the public education, most of them coming from the high schools with <b>agricultural</b> and economic <b>profile.</b> In order to improve the promotion strategy, along with the options estimation, the investigation aimed also to identify the main reasons for the choice made and to highlight the main sources of information. Analyzing the distribution of reasons, we found out that the first reasons are: good training, existing specializations, internships abroad, providing accommodation...|$|R
40|$|Until 1989 the {{agriculture}} {{of the former}} GDR was mainly oriented toward the self-supply of the country's 16 mill. inhabitants. It was centrally planned and developed and organized to yield the highest possible returns of the natural potential. Presently, it is undergoing a fundamental change. Since {{the opening of the}} border between the two German states, the integration into the agricultural market of the EC, the economic and monetary union of July 1, 1990, agriculture has been confronted with numerous new problems. Among these are the breakdown of the East German distribution and supply networks, offensive marketing strategies of big West German suppliers and retail chains, a lack of the necessary legal, man-power oriented, technological and financial prerequisites for a conversion of the <b>agricultural</b> production <b>profile</b> toward a market orientation. Other issues include financial problems due to old debts and questions of property rights etc. Thuringia -one of the five East German states with approximately 880 000 ha of agricultural land- serves as an example. A comparison of indicators of agricultural land use for the years 1989 and 1990 / 91 reveals the rapid change taking place in the century-old agricultural regions. Thuringia has a wide array of physiographic regions. They range from wood-covered mountain ranges of an altitude up to 1000 m to loesscovered regions, well suited for agriculture (see the comprehensive three step valuation in fig. 1). The acreage for vegetables and root crops has been considerably reduced, predominantly in regions with soils of lower quality. Oil seeds, on the other hand, and especially colza reach new dimensions due to EC subsidies. Pastures tend to be enlarged, a reduction in the intensity of use of the pastures can be observed. The reduction of livestock (cattle/hogs/sheep) set in immediately after 1989, in 1990 there was for example already a reduction of 488 000 hogs. A differentiation of the stock reductions according to the three valuation classes was already noticeable in 1990. 90 000 jobs in agriculture were lost between 1989 and 1992, all parts of the state were affected in a similar way. The adaptation of {{the agriculture}} of Thuringia to market principles has begun. The polarization between regions of lower agricultural potential and regions of high valuation begins to take shape. The future development will give further contours to this tendency...|$|R
40|$|Phosphorus (P) is an {{important}} element for crop production, but build-up of excess soil P can promote P leaching and eutrophication of surface waters. To better understand the dynamics of P release from soil to waters, more knowledge is needed about sorption patterns and P speciation in agricultural soils. Two new indices were developed to assess the importance of P sorption to hydroxy-interlayered clay minerals, and to evaluate the amount of hydroxy-interlayering and hydroxy-interlayer stability. A strong relationship was found between oxalate-extractable aluminium (Al) {{and the amount of}} hydroxy-interlayering in soil, suggesting a common source. This makes it difficult to analytically distinguish between phosphate (PO 4) adsorbed to hydroxy-interlayers from PO 4 adsorbed to Al hydroxide-type precipitates. Application of X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy to evaluate P speciation in soil profiles and the effects of P depletion and fertilisation revealed a distinct change in P speciation with increasing soil depth in an <b>agricultural</b> clay soil <b>profile.</b> The results indicated that the subsoil P predominantly occurred as apatite, whereas PO 4 adsorbed with Al-hydroxides or hydroxy-interlayers dominated in the topsoil. Organic P and PO 4 adsorbed to iron (Fe) -(hydr) oxides were observed only in the topsoil. This can be explained by long-term weathering of apatite and silicates, particularly ferromagnesian forms such as amphibole, in the upper soil horizons, causing an association of the released PO 4 with secondary metal (hydr) oxides. Collectively, the XANES results showed that the most important phases governing P retention and release in agricultural clay soils are adsorption of PO 4 to Al and to Fe in (hydr) oxide minerals or interlayers. After fertilisation, P was adsorbed to Al hydroxide phases in six different soil types studied, but in two of the soils there was also an increase in calcium phosphate. Moreover, P solubility was shown to be lowest at pH values ranging from 4. 5 to 7. 5 and increased with decreasing pH, probably {{as a result of the}} dissolution of apatite and PO 4 -bearing hydroxy-Al precipitates at low pH...|$|R
40|$|Tropical peatlands from {{southeast}} Asia {{are undergoing}} extensive drainage, deforestation and degradation for agriculture and human settlement purposes. This is resulting in biomass loss and subsidence of peat from its oxidation. Molecular profiling approaches {{were used to}} understand the relative influences of different land-use patterns, hydrological and physicochemical parameters {{on the state of}} degraded tropical peatlands. As microbial communities {{play a critical role in}} biogeochemical cascades in the functioning of peatlands, we used microbial and metabolic profiles as surrogates of community structure and functions, respectively. Profiles were generated from 230 bacterial 16 S rDNA fragments and 145 metabolic markers of 46 samples from 10 sites, including those from above and below water table in a contiguous area of 48 km 2 covering five land-use types. These were degraded forest, degraded land, oil palm plantation, mixed crop plantation and settlements. Bacterial profiles were most influenced by variations in water table and land-use patterns, followed by age of drainage and peat thickness in that order. Bacterial profiling revealed differences in sites, based on the duration and frequency of water table fluctuations and on oxygen availability. Mixed crop plantations had the most diverse bacterial and metabolic profiles. Metabolic profiling, being closely associated with biogeochemical functions, could distinguish communities not only based on land-use types but also their geographic locations, thus providing a finer resolution than bacterial <b>profiles.</b> <b>Agricultural</b> inputs, such as nitrates, were highly associated with bacterial community structure of oil palm plantations, whereas phosphates and dissolved organic carbon influenced those from mixed crop plantations and settlements. Our results provide a basis for adopting molecular marker-based approaches to classify peatlands and determine relative importance of factors that influence peat functioning. Our findings will be useful in peatland management by providing a basis to focus early efforts on hydrological interventions and improving sustainability of oil palm plantations by adopting mixed cropping practices to increase microbial diversity in the long term...|$|R
40|$|Our study {{aimed at}} {{identifying}} key {{processes in the}} dynamics that relate agriculture under different driving forces and landscape ecological patterning, in a perspective of multifunctional development. Regarding driving forces, a particular emphasis was put on agri-environmental schemes, seen as a possible support for the development and maintenance of landscape. This study was based upon an empirical multiscale research setting on two NUTS 2 (Basse-Normandie) and NUTS 3 (Eure-et-Loir) regions. This paper presents results from the Basse-Normandie case. The research setting beneficiated from several years surveys in a Natural Regional Park (NRP Cotentin-Bessin) on farms socioeconomic trajectories, farmers’ adoption of agri-environmental measures {{and the role of}} the Park in agri-environmental development. A municipality was chosen for a set of farmers’ interviews and field observations about the evolution of farmers’ landscape management in relation to farm trajectories and agri-environmental schemes. At regional scales, dynamics of municipality cropping patterns were assessed from CAP crop registration databases; explanatory factors of these patterns were tested. At farm-local scales, the result firstly showed that farmers applied differently to agri-environmental schemes according to their farm profile and contract trajectories. This confirmed earlier results on larger samples of farms. Similar conclusions applied to the question of the maintenance of contractual practices after the end of the contract. The role of Natural Regional Park of Cotentin-Bessin was underlined in term of coordination and institutional support for the agri-environmental scheme and local development. This role has been however mitigated by the organization of the different phases of agri-environmental schemes that did allow little anticipation. The results showed that agri-environmental measures had different consequences on farmers’ landscape management and on landscape patterning according to between and inside farm diversity and organization of practices. At landscape scales, both landscape processes toward more heterogeneity or more homogeneity of the mosaic (even accompanied with management intensification) accompanied farm changes under agri-environmental contracts. At local-regional scales, the tested factors of municipality crop patterns emphasized the combined influence of historical features (Small <b>Agricultural</b> Areas), farm <b>profiles</b> and recent processes like rural activities, population changes and the enlargement and scattering of farms among several municipalities. This study takes part in our search for the development of indicators of these relationships and methods for evaluating changes in the long run and supplementing models for scenario-based simulations...|$|R
40|$|Like many North American {{agricultural}} regions, Saskatchewan {{has experienced}} significant fundamental structural changes in farming. Structural change encompasses evolution in distribution of farm sizes, land tenure and financial characteristics, {{as well as}} variations in demographic and production characteristics. These issues are often a source of discontent among farm populations as it implies these populations are forced to adapt {{in a number of}} potentially unpleasant ways. These changes have profound and sometimes poorly understood effects on the rural economy – for example, structural change affects rural population and therefore demand for rural infrastructure. Traditional agricultural farm level analysis is often conducted using a representative farm or group, but this framework cannot capture the growing heterogeneity of modern farm operators or the current operating environment in <b>agricultural</b> regions. Farm <b>profiles</b> vary by demographic characteristics, such as age and education, and resource endowments. Agent-based simulation captures this heterogeneity through a farm by farm analysis, where after initialization, the regional economy evolves over time. A synthetic population is created based on survey data and the land characteristics based on the actual land data in CAR 7 B of Saskatchewan. A number of different price and yield time paths were created using a bootstrap procedure on historical data and the model evolved to potential agriculture structures that may occur in the model region, 30 years in the future. Structural change occurs endogenously as farms interact in land markets, and make decisions on land use. Agents compete for available land in a purchase and lease market with land selling to the highest bidder. The dynamic nature of agent-based models allows individual farms to adjust land use in response to changing economic conditions and individual preferences. How individuals organize their resources will be critical to farm survival and growth. The results indicate that many of the trends are the same under the different price and yield time paths, however the rate of change is significantly impacted by the price and yield time path that occurs. The model predicted the trend to fewer and larger farms will continue into the future. The forecasted distribution of smaller farms will decline and proportion of large farms will increase, while mid sized farms will remain relatively unchanged. The proportion of mixed farms, land use, and total livestock numbers depend significantly on the price and yield time path. The actual structure that will occur will be the result of the actual individual price and yield time path that occurs...|$|R

Este trabalho teve o objetivo de avaliar o efeito dos sistemas de cultivo mÃnimo e plantio direto: plantio direto durante quatro anos consecutivos (PD 4); cultivo mÃnimo apÃs quatro anos consecutivos com o plantio direto (CM 4); plantio direto durante oito anos consecutivos (PD 8) e cultivo mÃnimo apÃs oito anos consecutivos com o plantio direto (CM 8). Foram trabalhadas nestas Ãreas as mesmas culturas, soja no verÃo e milho no inverno, com os mesmos conjuntos motomecanizados para as atividades de semeadura, pulverizaÃÃo e colheita. Foram avaliados o rendimento da cultura da soja, os parÃmetros de densidade do solo, densidade de partÃculas, matÃria orgÃnica, porosidade total, porosidade de agregados (microporosidade), porosidade estrutural (macroporosidade), nas profundidades de 0 a 0, 05; 0, 05 a 0, 10; 0, 10 a 0, 15 e 0, 15 a 0, 20 m, coletados em trÃs Ãpocas distintas: um dia apÃs a implantaÃÃo da cultura; 60 dias apÃs a semeadura e apÃs a colheita. O ensaio foi realizado em Latossolo Roxo, em Medianeira, regiÃo Oeste do ParanÃ. Os resultados mostraram que a densidade do solo diminuiu com o sistema de cultivo mÃnimo CM 4 e CM 8, a porosidade total e porosidade estrutural aumentaram com a diminuiÃÃo da densidade. Os valores mÃdios de matÃria orgÃnica foram estatisticamente iguais para todos os sistemas de cultivo, apesar de apresentarem diferenÃa significativa entre as camadas avaliadas, com o maior valor na superfÃcie. A faixa da Ãrea trabalhada hÃ quatro e oito anos com plantio direto foi avaliada em relaÃÃo ao teor de Ãgua no solo de 10 a 18 % e 15 a 24 % respectivamente. O rendimento da cultura da soja foi 12 % maior para os sistemas de plantio direto - PD 4 e PD 8. The {{handling}} systems can affect physical qualities of agricultural soils as density and porosity, {{as well as}} the organic matter reserves distributed on <b>agricultural</b> layerâs <b>profile.</b> This trial aimed at evaluating the effect of no-tillage and minimum tillage systems: no-tillage system during four consecutive years (NT 4); minimum tillage after four consecutive years with direct no-tillage system (MT 4); no-tillage system during eight consecutive years (NT 8) and; minimum tillage after eight consecutive years with no-tillage system (MT 8). Cultures as soybean and maize were carried out in this field, the first one on summertime and the second in the winter with the same motomechanized sets for sowing, spraying and harvesting activities. The yield of soybean culture, soilâs density, particle density, organic matter, total porosity, porosity of adding (microporosity) and structural porosity (macroporosity) were evaluated, regarding depths from 0 to 0. 05; 0. 05 to 0. 10; 0. 10 to 0. 15 and 0. 15 to 0. 20 m, which were collected at three different periods: one day after the cultureâs implantation; 60 days after the sowing and on the harvest day. This trial was carried out in Distroferric Red Latosoil, in Medianeira (PR). The results showed that soilâs density decreased with the MT 4 and MT 8 minimum tillage systems; and the total porosity and structural porosity increased proportionally when density decreased. The average results from organic matter were statistically similar for all the tillage systems, even though they have shown a significantly difference among the studied layers, with the greatest value. The band of the worked area has four and eight years with no-tillage were evaluated in relation to the water text in the ground of 10 to 24 % and 15 to 24 % respectively. The soybean yield was 12 % greater for the NT 4 and NT 8 no-tillage systems...|$|R
40|$|The hydrogeology, {{stable isotope}} distribution, and {{chemical}} distribution of Cl- and NO 3 [...] N within the Battersea Drainage Basin in southern Alberta were investigated. The Battersea Drainage Basin {{is characterized by}} widespread spreading of livestock manure on irrigated farmland and a high density of feedlots, creating concern about groundwater quality in the region. Past research has used conventional piezometers to study the source, distribution and fate of nitrate in the shallow groundwater. The key component of this research involved using the new technique of high-resolution profiling to determine the distribution, source, fate, and transport of nitrate in the shallow geological groundwater environment. High-resolution profiles of δ 2 H indicated groundwater throughout the glaciofluvial deposits and between 5. 4 and 13. 7 m below ground in glaciolacustrine deposits contained values > - 150. 0 ‰ and tritiated waters (> 0. 08 TU). This suggested that this water recharged within the past 60 years. At depth 5. 4 to 13. 5 m BG, lower δ 2 H values did not coincide with detectable tritium, indicating the groundwater was much older and not vulnerable to <b>agricultural</b> contamination. High-resolution <b>profiles</b> of Cl- and NO 3 [...] N (solid core and squeezed pore water data) showed concentrations of these ions up to 411 and 219 mg L- 1, respectively, in the glaciofluvial deposits. Concentrations of Cl- and NO 3 [...] N decreased to less than 50 mg L- 1 (Cl-) and the Drinking Water Standard for NO 3 [...] N (10 mg L- 1) in the underlying glaciolacustrine and glacial till deposits at most sites. Comparison to the high-resolution δ 2 H profiles suggested the high nitrate concentration in the glaciofluvial sediments is agricultural in origin. High concentrations for Cl- and NO 3 [...] N (up to 257 and 209 mg L- 1, respectively) observed in glacial till and glaciolacustrine deposits below 6. 0 m BG at two sites (LB 5 a and LB 6) did not coincide with modern water, indicating the source of high nitrate is geologic in origin. The NO 3 [...] N to Cl- ratios suggested denitrification was not appreciable in the glaciofluvial deposits. However, denitrification may be a cause of decreased nitrate in the underlying fine textured deposits at certain sites. Interpretation of the high resolution profiles also suggested that the major conduit for nitrate migration is in near-surface glaciofluvial sediments via advection. The distributions of δ 2 H, Cl- and NO 3 [...] N with depth suggest that transport in the underlying glaciolacustrine and glacial till deposits is diffusion dominated, thus acting as a sink and removing nitrate from the permeable zone. However, the presence of fracturing in the oxidized zone of glacial tills and glaciolacustrine deposits suggests that transport may occur via advection through fracturing and diffusion in the material matrix. High-resolution profiling of δ 2 H, Cl- and NO 3 [...] N proved to be valuable in obtaining information regarding the distribution, source, and transport of groundwater and nitrate in the shallow groundwater environment {{at a level of}} detail that cannot be readily obtained through use of conventional piezometers...|$|R
