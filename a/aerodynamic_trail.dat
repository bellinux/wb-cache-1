40|$|The {{effect of}} stalled flow {{hysteresis}} {{in the process}} of streamlining a cylindrical solid, isolated backswept wing of a model aircraft and a decelerating compressor cascade is analyzed in the given article. The structure and the performances of stalled flows depending on the speed of the flow, angles of attack and on the direction of their change are considered. Generalized results of research of hysteresis effect occurrence in aerodynamic perfor-mances of compressor cascades and its influence on compressor blade rings performances that operate in real conditions of periodic circular inlet distortion induced by <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>trail</b> behind the blade cascade of the compressor inlet guide vane are demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Mathematical {{modeling}} of complex turbulent near-wall flows, that occur during {{the flow of}} airfoils, is impossible without understanding {{the nature of the}} flow in boundary layer. From a mathematical point of view, the calculation of such flows, because in practical problems they regarded as turbulent, and the characteristics of turbulence are largely dependent on the geometry of the profile of the longitudinal component of the average velocity of the near-wall flow. Based on this, the purpose of this work is studying and mathematical {{modeling of}} turbulent near-wall flows in the interaction with the real streamlined surface, that has certain features, such as the curvature, roughness, etc., as well as the study and research of the influence of the pressure gradient on the empirical coefficients, parameters of the flow, velocity profiles and friction stress. Methods: We performed t he calculations using numerical finite-difference marching method with algebraic model of turbulent viscosity coefficient. Results: In this paper we present some results of the numerical study of the effect of the positive pressure gradient on the empirical coefficients of the transition zone and the law of the near-wall and the outer-wall areas. Discussion : Comparison of the calculated results with the experimental data shows that the proposed approaches provide an opportunity to simulate the flow {{as close as possible to}} their physical properties. Presented mathematical model for the calculation of turbulent boundary layers and near-wall flows makes it possible to calculate such a complex and valuable from a practical point of view type of the flow as the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>trail</b> behind the streamlined body. </p...|$|E

40|$|Within an {{experimental}} trailing edge noise reduction {{study in the}} Aeroacoustic Wind Tunnel Braunschweig (AWB) both acoustic and <b>aerodynamic</b> effects of <b>trailing</b> edge brush devices were examined. Directional microphone and hot wire measurements were undertaken on a zero-lift generic plate model (Re = 2. 1 to 7. 9 x 10 Million). Various brush concepts were tested to clarify the functional relationship between design parameters and the ensuing aeroacoustic properties. First results of this ongoing work indicate a significant source noise reduction in excess of 10 db, thereby revealing two relevant noise reduction mechanisms. In addition to broadband turbulent boundary layer trailing edge noise also narrow band contributions due to vortex shedding from the edge were alleviated...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe study {{focuses on}} the slipstreaming effect on an <b>aerodynamic</b> sedan vehicle, <b>trailing</b> a {{semi-trailer}} truck on highways. A Subsonic wind tunnel (100 × 100 × 100 cm) is used to investigate the effect of slipstreaming. For design purpose, solid works software is used. Wooden models of semi-trailer truck and a sedan car have been constructed. In this experiment, the effect of distance of separation of the vehicles to slipstreaming has been studied and the critical distance is identified. The relative drag during slipstreaming at different velocities of the critical distance has also been addressed. From this experimental investigation {{it has been observed}} that slipstreaming is effective at higher velocities of the vehicles under consideration...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate aerodynamic interference effect of wing tip vortex in formation flight of high speed aircraft. In formation flight, wing tip vortex produced by leading aircraft can affect on the <b>aerodynamic</b> characteristics of <b>trailing</b> aircraft. The interference effect of flow is varied with distances between wing tips of leading and trailing aircraft. It is confirmed, in this study, that the interference of wing tip vortex generated from the leading aircraft makes the aerodynamic forces and moments of the trailing aircraft with the vertical or horizontal positions of the trailing aircraft. Especially, the lift coefficients of trailing aircraft were highly increased at y/b=- 0. 125, z/b= 0. 0 or deeply decreased at y/b=- 0. 5, z/b= 0. 38. The interfering pattern of wing tip vortices from two aircraft is precisely observed...|$|R
40|$|Norway. The {{purpose of}} the Symposium was " [...] . to review and discuss recent {{developments}} in wake research for aircraft and the implications for air traffic regulations, " with a clear emphasis on the hazard of vortex encounters in civil aviation. Sessions were devoted specifically to operational procedures and aircraft spacings in airport terminal areas; to the <b>aerodynamic</b> interactions between <b>trailing</b> vortices and following aircraft; to trailing vortex structures, instabilities, atmospheric effects on wakes, and vortex breakdown; and to miscellaneous issues, such as vortices generated by other vehicles and the interactions between vortex wakes and engine exhausts. The Symposium was unclassified, and it was rather unusual {{with respect to the}} broad range of interests of the active participants: representatives of regulatory agencies; aircraft manufacturers and operators; and research scientists engaged in flight tests, flight simulations, and basic experimental and theoretical fluid dynamics. Thirty-seven papers were presented at the meeting (see Appendix). An overview of the Symposium and some general conclusions and recommendations are given in this Evaluation Report. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{results were}} {{presented}} of a parametric study performed {{to determine the}} optimum wing geometry for a proposed space shuttle orbiter. The {{results of the study}} establish the minimum weight wing for a series of wing-fuselage combinations subject to constraints on <b>aerodynamic</b> heating, wing <b>trailing</b> edge sweep, and wing over-hang. The study consists of a generalized design evaluation which has the flexibility of arbitrarily varying those wing parameters which influence the vehicle system design and its performance. The study is structured to allow inputs of aerodynamic, weight, aerothermal, structural and material data in a general form so that the influence of these parameters on the design optimization process can be isolated and identified. This procedure displays the sensitivity of the system design of variations in wing geometry. The parameters of interest are varied in a prescribed fashion on a selected fuselage and the effect on the total vehicle weight is determined. The primary variables investigated are: wing loading, aspect ratio, leading edge sweep, thickness ratio, and taper ratio...|$|R
50|$|The Fafnir was not {{the first}} glider with a {{cantilever}} wing, for the Darmstadt Konsul had been built seven years earlier but a cantilever wing with an aspect ratio of almost 20 was exceptional. The single wing spar had to be deep for strength and Lippisch accommodated this by using the Göttingen 652 airfoil which is thick and strongly cambered, additionally providing lift at low speeds. The wing root was faired into the upper fuselage. The wing was straight tapered in plan to elliptical tips and the profile changed along the span through the less cambered, more widely used Göttingen 535 to the familiar Clarke Y profile with washout at the tips to prevent tip stalling. It was plywood covered ahead of the spar, with fabric covering aft. Laterally stabilising dihedral was not common on gliders in 1929 but Lippisch applied it to about 40% of the inner span on the Fafnir, producing a gull wing. Many later gliders followed this form, though it is harder to build and has no solid <b>aerodynamic</b> justification. The <b>trailing</b> edges of the outer part of the wing carried broad and constant chord ailerons.|$|R
40|$|Aircraft travel {{has become}} a major form of transportation. Several of our major {{airports}} are operating near their capacity limit, increasing congestion and delays for travelers. As a result, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has been working in conjunction with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), airline operators, and the airline industry to increase airport capacity without sacrificing public safety. One solution to the problem is {{to increase the number of}} airports and build new. runways; yet, this solution is becoming increasingly difficult due to limited space. A better solution is to increase the production per runway. This solution increases the possibility that one aircraft will encounter the trailing wake of another aircraft. Hazardous wake vortex encounters occur when an aircraft encounters the wake produced by a heavier aircraft. This heavy-load aircraft produces high-intensity wake turbulence that redistributes the <b>aerodynamic</b> loads of <b>trailing</b> smaller aircraft. This situation is particularly hazardous for smaller aircraft during takeoffs and landings. In order to gain a better understanding of the wake-vortex/aircraft encounter phenomena, NASA Langley Research Center conducted a series of flight tests from 1995 through 1997. These tests were designed to gather data for the development a wake encounter and wake-measurement data set with the accompanying atmospheric state information. This data set is being compiled into a database that can be used by wake vortex researchers to compare with experimental and computational results. The purpose of this research is to derive and implement a procedure for calculating the wake-vortex/aircraft interaction portion of that database by using the data recorded during those flight tests. There were three objectives to this research. Initially, the wake-induced forces and moments from each flight were analyzed based on varying flap deflection angles. The flap setting alternated between 15 and 30 degrees while the separation distance remained constant. This examination was performed to determine if increases in flap deflection would increase or decrease the effects of the wake-induced forces and moments. Next, the wake-induced forces and moments from each flight were analyzed based on separation distances of 1 - 3 nautical miles. In this comparison, flap deflection was held constant at 30 degrees. The purpose of this study was to determine if increased separation distances reduced the effects of the wake vortex on the aircraft. The last objective compared the wake-induced forces and moments of each flight as it executed a series of maneuvers through the wake-vortex. This analysis was conducted to examine the impact of the wake on the B 737 as it traversed the wake horizontally and vertically. Results from the first analysis indicated that there was no difference in wake effect at flap deflections of 15 and 30 degrees. This conclusion is evidenced in the cases of the wake-induced sideforce, rolling moment, and yawing moment. The wake-induced lift, drag, and pitching moment cases yielded less conclusive results. The second analysis compared the wake-induced forces and moments at separation distances of 1 - 3 nautical miles. Results indicated that there was no significant difference in the wake-induced lift, drag, sideforce, or yawing moment coefficients. The analysis compared the wake-induced forces and moments based on different flight maneuvers. It was found that the wake-induced forces and moments had the greatest impact on out-to-in and in-to-out maneuvers...|$|R
