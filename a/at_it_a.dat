500|$|Starting with Caged Bird, Angelou made a {{deliberate}} attempt while writing all her autobiographies, including Mom & Me & Mom, {{to challenge the}} usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Her use of fiction-writing techniques such as dialogue, characterization, and thematic development has often led reviewers to categorize her books as autobiographical fiction. [...] Valerie Sayers, in her review of Mom & Me & Mom in The Washington Post, calls Angelou's books memoirs because of their limited focus, but praises her for describing {{what it was like}} to grow up Black in [...] "Jim Crow America". [...] Sayers states: [...] "She manages to fully reveal that national sore without picking <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> <b>a</b> neat trick that...requires considerable restraint and her own steely goodwill". [...] Angelou stated in a 1989 interview that she was the only [...] "serious" [...] writer to choose the genre to express herself. [...] As critic Susan Gilbert stated, Angelou was reporting not one person's story, but the collective's. [...] Scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe agreed, and viewed Angelou as representative of the convention in African-American autobiography as a public gesture that spoke for an entire group of people. [...] Angelou's editor Robert Loomis was able to convince her to write Caged Bird by challenging her to write an autobiography that could be considered [...] "high art", which she continued throughout her series. [...] Although Angelou was successful, she was, as Sayers insisted, smart and gifted enough to write for any audience, but chose not to write for [...] "a highbrow literary audience", but for [...] "readers as open, playful and straightforward as herself".|$|E
2500|$|This was {{followed}} by an anonymous review in the March 1811 The Critical Review that argued: [...] "The Curse of Kehama is a performance of precisely this violent and imposing description. Like the shield of Atlante, it strikes dead everything that is opposed to it; one might as well hold a farthering candle to the sun, as to think of placing Homer, or Shakspeare, or Milton or Dante, {{by the side of}} it. But it is the false blaze of enchantment, not the steady radiance of truth and nature; and if you gain courage to look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> second or third time, the magic has lost its power, and you only wonder what it was that dazzled you." [...] The review continued, [...] "we think there is quite enough to discover to us how great a poet Mr. Southey might be, were the single gift of judgment {{to be added to the}} qualities which he undoubtedly possesses. Till then, we fear that we shall never be able to subscribe to the belief in a Trinity of living poets, of whom Mr. S. is represented as entitled to the foremost honours." ...|$|E
