50|$|<b>Accrued</b> <b>expense</b> is a {{liability}} whose timing or amount is uncertain {{by virtue of}} the fact that an invoice has not yet been received. The uncertainty of the <b>accrued</b> <b>expense</b> is not significant enough to qualify it as a provision. An example of an <b>accrued</b> <b>expense</b> is a pending obligation to pay for goods or services received from a counterpart, while cash is to be paid out in a later accounting period when the amount is deducted from accrued expenses.|$|E

To put this more clearly, deferred income - the money that a company receives in advance - indicates {{the goods and services}} the company owes to its customers, while <b>accrued</b> <b>expense</b> indicates the money a company owes to others.|$|E

50|$|The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audited {{appellee}} corporation's 1972 tax return. The corporation {{filed an}} amended return, claiming it {{was entitled to}} deduct its reserve as an <b>accrued</b> <b>expense,</b> and seek a refund. The IRS disallowed the deduction.|$|E
50|$|For example, goods {{supplied}} by a vendor in one accounting period, but paying {{for them in}} a later period results in an <b>accrued</b> <b>expense</b> that prevents a fictitious increase in the receiving company's value equal {{to the increase in}} its inventory (assets) by the cost of the goods received, but unpaid. Without such <b>accrued</b> <b>expense,</b> a sale of such goods in the period they were supplied would cause that the unpaid inventory (recognized as an expense fictitiously incurred) would effectively offset the sale proceeds (revenue) resulting in a fictitious profit in the period of sale, and in a fictitious loss in the latter period of payment, both equal to the cost of goods sold.|$|E
50|$|Period costs, such as office {{salaries}} {{or selling}} expenses, are immediately recognized as expenses (and offset against revenues {{of the accounting}} period) also when employees are paid in the next period. Unpaid period costs are <b>accrued</b> <b>expenses</b> (liabilities) to avoid such costs (as expenses fictitiously incurred) to offset period revenues {{that would result in}} a fictitious profit. An example is a commission earned at the moment of sale (or delivery) by a sales representative who is compensated {{at the end of the}} following week, in the next accounting period. The company recognizes the commission as an expense incurred immediately in its current income statement to match the sale proceeds (revenue), so the commission is also added to <b>accrued</b> <b>expenses</b> in the sale period to prevent it from otherwise becoming a fictitious profit, and it is deducted from <b>accrued</b> <b>expenses</b> in the next period to prevent it from otherwise becoming a fictitious loss, when the rep is compensated.|$|R

50|$|Deferred revenue (or {{deferred}} income) is a liability, such as {{cash received}} from a counterpart for {{goods or services}} {{that are to be}} delivered in a later accounting period. When such income item is earned, the related revenue item is recognized, and the deferred revenue is reduced. It shares characteristics with <b>accrued</b> <b>expense</b> with the difference that a liability to be covered later is an obligation to pay for goods or services received from a counterpart, while cash for them is to be paid out in a later period when its amount is deducted from accrued expenses.|$|E

Deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from timing differences in the recognition of revenues and expenses based on financial accounting standards and tax laws. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are recognized in the financial statements because it can lead to future tax payments to be larger or smaller. Sample of this study consists of 38 companies from manufacturing sectors listed on Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2011 - 2014. Multiple regression analysis is used to determine the effect of each component of deferred tax assets and liabilities for future current tax. Data components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are taken from the Notes to the Financial Statements of the company. The results show that deferred tax assets of post-employment benefits has negatively significant and deferred tax liabilities of accelerated depreciation has negatively significant to future tax. This is due to the possibility of some companies samples to defer tax payments. While the results for the deferred tax assets of <b>accrued</b> <b>expenses</b> do not affect future tax.

40|$|Government {{accounting}} {{and other financial}} management practices have in recent times {{become one of the}} major target areas of public management reform. Public sector organisations traditionally use accounting systems based on cash inflows and cash outflows, commonly known as cash accounting. This cash style of accounting differs significantly from accounting systems used in the private sector, so called accrual accounting systems. The recent reforms to government accounting systems have focused largely on implementing accrual accounting in the public sector. The exponents of accrual accounting argue that it provides significantly more detailed and accurate financial information than cash systems. One of the basic principles of {{accounting and}} financial reporting is that it should provide a true and fair view of the financial operations and financial position of an entity. Given that cash accounting records cash transactions only, no consideration is given to assets and liabilities or to items extending beyond the accounting period (i. e. prepayments and <b>accrued</b> <b>expenses).</b> Accrual accounting on the other hand produces detailed information on assets and liabilities and requires depreciation expenses to be matched to the expected life of the related asset. Similarly, <b>accruing</b> <b>expenses</b> such as employee entitlements are represented in the financial reports. Countries with a Westminster style of government have tended to be the leaders in implementing accrual accounting in the public sector. This research paper provides a detailed description and analysis of the financial reforms undertaken in the Australian Commonwealth public sector...|$|R
2500|$|Strip clubs which {{practice}} [...] Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) typically report {{negative working}} capital, where current liabilities exceed current assets. [...] Clubs receive immediate cash payment for sales, while inventories, <b>accrued</b> <b>expenses,</b> and other current liabilities normally carry longer payment terms.

Service revenues include entertainer payments to perform at clubs, customer admission fees, customer payments for tabs and tip charges, dance dollar payments, and suite rental fees. The economic downturn, which accelerated in 2008, impacted clubs at all levels, and even higher-end gentlemen's clubs {{in some parts of}} the U.S. and elsewhere adjusted their business practices to compensate for reduced revenues.|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} footnote 3 in the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s 1987 opinion in United States v. General Dynamics. In that case, {{governed by the}} law in place before the Tax Reform Act of 1984, the Court held that General Dynamics had to defer deductions attributable to claims for employee medical expenses until the claims were approved. In the footnote, the Court suggested that the 1984 amendment to section 461 (h) of the Internal Revenue Code postponing the time for deducting <b>accrued</b> <b>expenses</b> until economic performance would, in a similar case governed by the statutory change, have further deferred General Dynamics 2 ̆ 7 deduction until time of payment. The author argues that the Court was wrong as a general matter (even though its suggestion might accidentally lead to the right timing result in some cases). He argues that the Court misread the legislative history of section 461 (h) and provided no theoretical justification for treating economic performance as occurring at time of payment (rather than when services are provided) {{in the case of}} 2 ̆ 2 employee benefit liabilities. 2 ̆ 2 Moreover, the Court ignored the potential effects of other sections of the Code, such as section 404, which might control the timing of deductions associated with deferred benefits provided through unfunded medical reimbursement plans...|$|R
