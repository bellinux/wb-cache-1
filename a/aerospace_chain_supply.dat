40|$|The <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> of <b>aerospace</b> {{products}} can be complex, involving thousands of components per product {{and hundreds of}} vendors spaced out over an increasingly global landscape. Managing all inputs necessary for these complex <b>aerospace</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> is a task that {{is critical to the}} success of any firm and requires extensive planning, close partnerships, and detailed analysis. This thesis outlines a system for optimal safety stock management in high volume <b>aerospace</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains.</b> Given such <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> parameters as component inventory values, procurement and manufacturing lead times, demand distributions, and bills of material, the ideal safety stock locations and sizes which result in minimal overall inventory levels are calculated by a nonlinear optimization program. With this safety stock structure, aerospace firms can operate their <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> with higher customer service rates and lower inventory levels. A methodology is also developed to help aerospace companies improve their existing <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> as efficiently as possible. Considering the limited time and resources available, a company may not be able to enhance all areas of its operations and determining where to improve with the greatest effect on customer service levels and inventory can be difficult. The framework developed provides general guidelines to ensure improvement resources are being deployed most efficiently. Finally, business environment and operations considerations are discussed to aid companies in the process of implementing <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> improvements and instituting organizational change. by Brian Robert Masse.

A hybrid mass and energy balance methodology is presented to simulate composite material production processes within a framework using physics inputs. Verification of the simulation results has been demonstrated through comparison with real aerospace material pricing. A production cost mark-up factor has been identified. as the greatest contributor toward material price, owing to its recurring manifestation at each tier interface. Dominant production costs at discrete <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> tiers have been shown to develop from raw process materials, through energy dominant production techniques, finally resulting in large labour commitments for material handling and equipment preservation. The methodology investigates two non-deterministic aspects of production simulation; cost drivers changing with time and production processes changing with technology.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} how different dimensions of power influence knowledge integration throughout innovation processes in <b>aerospace</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains.</b> The existing literature covering innovation in <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> contexts has mainly focused on the resource-based view of power, on individual levels of analysis and has, to some extent, treated knowledge as something that appears to be easily transferrable, both within and across firms. Furthermore, various facets of power have been treated in isolation rather than in an inter-related fashion. The relationship between power and knowledge integration has also hardly been established in <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> contexts. These are important issues that need to be addressed because knowledge is dispersed throughout <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> in the <b>aerospace</b> industry and has to be drawn together to enable the development of existing and new products. Furthermore, different dimensions of power are recursively intertwined, and most management problems involve multi-level phenomena. Innovation and knowledge integration are also socially mediated and highly politicised processes, which are shaped and owned by internal and external stakeholders who periodically form part of these processes. This under-researched area will be addressed in this study by adopting a multi-dimensional framework of power, by examining multiple levels of interactions (the inter-organisational, intra-organisational, and intra-project levels) in <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> and by acknowledging the politics of innovation and knowledge integration processes. The objectives of this study were achieved by building theory based on four case studies. Each case study is made up of one original equipment manufacturer and one or two suppliers who work together along the innovation process. 10 organisations formed part of this study. Data were collected through 67 semi-structured interviews and documents. The data were then analysed by using template and matrix analysis. The result of this study is a configurational view at three different levels of analysis that highlights generative and degenerative effects of different dimensions of power on knowledge integration.

Both in literature and in commercial <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> management systems, a centralised approach to <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> planning is frequently proposed. Due to the incongruence between incentives of the firms involved in the <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> and overall <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> objectives, a centralised <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> planning will either not be accepted or will not lead to system-wide effectiveness. For this reason, <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> planning decisions are most commonly coordinated on a decentralised basis. In this paper, we analyse the implications and limitations of centralised and decentralised <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> planning approaches. The results derived from this analysis establish the basis for introducing a generic, conceptual approach supporting {{the design of a}} decentralised <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> planning. <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> management; SCM; <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> planning; centralised coordination; decentralised coordination; master planning; <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> design...|$|R

This study is accomplished by using survey questionnaire that was answered by 65 respondents from Malaysian automotive components manufacturing firms. The study found that <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> strategy had no direct relationship with <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> performance, but was mediated by <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> practices.
