The actual number of cameras made is somewhat higher than 300 since a few were retained at Pentax reserved for their own use. The actual number for sale however was 300 cameras according to Pentax in Tokyo. It is a superb example of Japanese camera workmanship.|$|E

40|$|The {{importation}} of fishery products into the European Union (EU) is constantly rising. The {{aim of this}} study was to conduct a survey on labeling non-compliances on fishery products imported from extraFuropean countries, in collaboration with the veterinary staff of the Border Inspection Post of Livorno Pisa (BIP), of the Italian Ministry of Health. The correspondence between the products' identity and the scientific denominations reported on the <b>accompanying</b> <b>certificates</b> was checked using the DNA Iparcoding method. Overall, 277 products belonging to different categories (fish, cephalopods, crustaceans, bivalves, amphibian) were submitted to analysis for species identification. The comparison of the molecular results with the scientific names declared on the accompanying documents showed that 22. 5 % (95 %CI 17. 8 - 28. 0) of the analyzed products were mislabeled. The highest percentage of mislabeling was observed on cephalopod based products (43. 8 %, 95 % CI 32. 3 - 55. 9), followed by crustaceans (17. 0 %, 95 % CI 9. 2 - 29. 2) and'fish (14. 0 %, 95 % CI 8. 7 - 21. 9). A higher rate was found in products imported from China, Vietnam and Thailand. The present study is the first survey on mislabeling in products sampled at BIPs in Italy. The results highlight the need of implementing analytical checks, based on DNA analysis, on incoming fishery products. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

A model is never an exact description of reality, and it is desirable that the identified model comes <b>accompanied</b> by <b>certificates</b> of quality able to describe the level of precision of the model and its domain of validity. This paper is about certified system identification. Our contention is that data contains more information than traditional identification methods can exploit, and, by looking at classical identification problems with new eyes, methods can be developed carrying precise quality guarantees that are valid under general assumptions. Taking the challenge of developing these methods {{may lead to a}} paradigm shift in many contexts in which {{identification is}} applied...|$|R
