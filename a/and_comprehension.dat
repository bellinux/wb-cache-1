By unselfishly releasing the anger he has held about his father's stories, Will gains the understanding that all we are our stories and that his father's stories gave him a reality and substance and a dimension that was as real, genuine, and deep as the day-to-day experiences that Will sought out. Will comes to understand, then, that his father—and the rest of us—are our stories and that the deeper reality of our lives may, in fact, not be our truest self.|$|E
5|$|Miller's Language and Communication {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{significant}} texts in the study of language behavior. The book was a scientific study of language, emphasizing quantitative data, and was based on the mathematical model of Claude Shannon's information theory. It used a probabilistic model imposed on a learning-by-association scheme borrowed from behaviorism, with Miller not yet attached to a pure cognitive perspective. The first part of the book reviewed information theory, the physiology and acoustics of phonetics, speech recognition <b>and</b> <b>comprehension,</b> and statistical techniques to analyze language. The focus was more on speech generation than recognition. The second part had the psychology: idiosyncratic differences across people in language use; developmental linguistics; the structure of word associations in people; use of symbolism in language; and social aspects of language use.|$|E
5|$|The Southeastern Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs (eventually renamed as the Southeastern Association of Colored Women’s Clubs) elected Bethune as {{president}} after its first conference in 1920 at the Tuskegee Institute. They intended {{to reach out}} to Southern Women (specifically white women) for support and unity in gaining rights for black women. The women met in Memphis, Tennessee to discuss interracial problems. In many respects, all of the women agreed about what needed to be changed, until they came to the topic of suffrage. The white women at the conference tried to strike down a resolution on black suffrage. The SACWC responded by issuing a pamphlet entitled Southern Negro Women and Race Co-Operation; it delineated their demands regarding conditions in domestic service, child welfare, conditions of travel, education, lynching, the public press, and voting rights. The group went on to help register black women to vote after they were granted suffrage a few months later after passage of the constitutional amendment. Within the state, however, and in other southern states, black men and women were largely disenfranchised by discriminatory application of literacy <b>and</b> <b>comprehension</b> tests, as well as requirements to pay poll taxes, lengthy residency requirements, and the need to keep and display records.|$|E

The subjects were 30 students of English Department at a university in Surabaya. A Vocabulary Size Test <b>and</b> a Reading <b>Comprehension</b> Test were administered to measure the subjects' vocabulary size <b>and</b> reading <b>comprehension</b> performance.

We measured children’s morphological awareness, word reading, <b>and</b> reading <b>comprehension</b> from T 1 to T 4, in addition to phonological awareness, vocabulary knowledge, and general cognitive ability at T 1 as control measures. Four plausible cross-lagged models were assessed and compared to examine the direction of the developmental relationships between morphological awareness <b>and</b> reading <b>comprehension</b> over time. Results found support for a reciprocal-causation model, that is, morphological awareness stably predicted subsequent reading <b>comprehension,</b> <b>and</b> the reverse relation was also found. Longitudinal mediation analyses revealed that word reading partially mediated the relationship between morphological awareness <b>and</b> reading <b>comprehension</b> in Chinese children. These findings extend our understanding of the relationship between morphological awareness <b>and</b> reading <b>comprehension.</b> The practical implications for these two developing skills in Chinese children are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study was to compare Irene C.

The {{researcher}} designed a correlational study to answer the following question: How do the Fountas and Pinnell guided reading levels among third grade students who were instructed in guided reading correlate with the reading <b>comprehension</b> <b>and</b> Lexile scores which were generated by the CRCT? The purpose was also to determine whether guided reading levels, gender, and ethnicity had a correlation to reading <b>comprehension</b> <b>and</b> Lexile scores on the CRCT. The participants in the study consisted of 546 third grade students who were instructed in guided reading for eight months during the 2007 - 2008 school year. The Pearson r and multiple regression analysis were used to analyze the data. The findings from the study showed that there was a positive linear relationship between guided reading levels <b>and</b> reading <b>comprehension</b> <b>and</b> Lexile scores on the CRCT. The findings also indicated that there was a positive linear relationship between gender, guided reading levels, <b>and</b> reading <b>comprehension</b> <b>and</b> Lexile scores.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{directionality}} of the relationship between text reading prosody <b>and</b> reading <b>comprehension</b> in the upper grades of primary school. We compared 3 theoretical possibilities: Two unidirectional relations from text reading prosody to reading <b>comprehension</b> <b>and</b> from reading <b>comprehension</b> to text reading prosody and a bidirectional relation between text reading prosody <b>and</b> reading <b>comprehension.</b> Further, we controlled for autoregressive effects and included decoding efficiency as a measure of general reading skill. Participants were 99 Dutch children, followed longitudinally, from 4 th to 6 th grade. Structural equation modeling showed that the bidirectional relation provided the best fitting model. In 5 th grade, text reading prosody was related to prior decoding <b>and</b> reading <b>comprehension,</b> whereas in 6 th grade, reading comprehension was related to prior text reading prosody. As such, the results suggest that the relation between text reading prosody <b>and</b> reading <b>comprehension</b> is reciprocal but dependent on grade level...|$|R

40|$|Although {{evidence}} suggests that individual differences in reading and mathematics skills are correlated, this relationship has typically only been studied in relation to word decoding or global measures of reading.

Multivariate genetic analyses of latent phenotypic factors of mathematics, word decoding <b>and</b> reading <b>comprehension</b> revealed substantial genetic and shared environmental correlations among all three domains. However, the phenotypic and genetic correlations between mathematics <b>and</b> reading <b>comprehension</b> were significantly greater than between mathematics and word decoding.
