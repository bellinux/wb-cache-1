5|$|<b>As</b> <b>Walter</b> {{undergoes}} a follow-up MRI, he flashes {{back to a}} past surgery, where he is being operated on by William Bell (AKA Dr Paris, played by Leonard Nimoy), who removed Walter's brain fragments and hid them in the patients' brains to prevent anyone else from gaining the information.|$|E

5|$|Besides sending Walter on {{diplomatic}} missions, King John gave Walter {{custody of}} Rochester Castle on 20 July 1202, but <b>as</b> <b>Walter</b> was already {{accounting for the}} taxes and fees {{of the city of}} Rochester to the Exchequer in 1200, it is possible that he held the castle before 1202. John also upheld the right of the archbishop to mint coins, which Walter held until his death in 1205.|$|E
5|$|Many golfing {{events have}} been {{hosted by the}} Whitecraigs Golf Club. The club was visited by the United States Ryder Cup teams of 1929 and 1933. The teams {{included}} many golfing legends such <b>as</b> <b>Walter</b> Hagen, Gene Sarazen and Horton Smith. Whitecraigs hosted the World Seniors' Golf Championship in 1976. In 1983, Jack Nicklaus visited the club to play an exhibition match and run a clinic.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} what {{happened}} at Salon Kitty first came to light in Walter Schellenberg's memoirs, published in Germany in 1956 under the title The Labyrinth. Peter Norden later expanded the story in his 1970 book Salon Kitty. This book became the basis for the highly controversial 1976 film Salon Kitty, directed by Tinto Brass and starring Helmut Berger <b>as</b> <b>Walter</b> Schellenberg (renamed Helmut Wallenberg) and Ingrid Thulin as Kitty Schmidt (renamed Kitty Kellermann).|$|E
50|$|The buttes {{stretch from}} {{southeast}} Portland into Damascus. Included are Gresham Butte (also known <b>as</b> <b>Walter's</b> Hill), Gabbert Hill, and Towle Butte.|$|R
50|$|In 1985, Walters set up {{a sports}} {{management}} agency with Franzese as a silent partner. Franzese was later subpoenaed to testify at Walters' trial, <b>as</b> <b>Walters</b> had invoked his name to frighten college athletes into signing management contracts.|$|R
50|$|In {{executing}} {{a search}} warrant for Rhoades' home, police found photos of a nude teenager who was later identified <b>as</b> <b>Walters,</b> whose {{body was found in}} September 1990. Also present were photos of Walsh, whose body was discovered that October.|$|R
5|$|Beauchamp is {{sometimes}} known <b>as</b> <b>Walter</b> de Beauchamp of Elmley, to distinguish {{him from the}} members of the Beauchamp family of Bedford. He married the daughter of Urse d'Abetot, who is usually named Emeline, although her name is not given in contemporary records. Urse d'Abetot was the Sheriff of Worcestershire from around 1069 to around 1108. Beauchamp may have been a tenant of his father-in-law prior to his marriage. Nothing is known for sure of Beauchamp's background, and he first witnessed a royal charter sometime between 1108 and 1111. Some documents suggest that his father may have been named Peveral de Beauchamp and that he had a brother named William Peveral de Beauchamp, but the only identifiable Peveral is younger than Walter.|$|E
5|$|Brian Delate <b>as</b> <b>Walter</b> Moore playing Kirk Burbank, Truman's father. When Truman was a boy, his {{character}} {{on the show}} was killed off to instill a fear of water in his son that would prevent Truman from leaving the set; however, he sneaks back onto the set when Truman is an adult. This causes Truman to begin questioning his staged life, and {{as he tries to}} get away from it the writers are forced to write a plot in which Kirk had not drowned but had suffered from amnesia.|$|E

Daniels and Tennessee lure the Alien to the terraforming bay, where they impale and eject it into space. The last human awake, Daniels is being returned to cryosleep by David, who inadvertently reveals his identity by not being able to recount Daniels' fantasy about building a log cabin by a lake, which she had previously recounted to Walter. Horrified, but unable to escape, Daniels is returned to stasis.|$|E

5|$|Edmund Evans (23 February 1826 – 21 August 1905) was a {{prominent}} English wood engraver and colour printer during the Victorian era. Evans specialized in full-colour printing, which, {{in part because of}} his work, became popular in the mid-19th century. He employed and collaborated with illustrators such <b>as</b> <b>Walter</b> Crane, Randolph Caldecott, Kate Greenaway and Richard Doyle to produce what are now considered to be classic children's books. Although little is known about his life, he wrote a short autobiography before his death in 1905 in which he described his life as a printer in Victorian London.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, Radcliffe portrayed Manny, a talkative corpse, in the indie film Swiss Army Man. That same year, he also starred <b>as</b> <b>Walter</b> Mabry in {{the action}} {{adventure}} film Now You See Me 2, ironically playing a technological prodigy who resents magic. He also starred off-Broadway at The Public Theater in a documentary theatre piece called Privacy, {{playing the role of}} The Writer. He starred in the 2016 release Imperium playing Nate Foster, an idealistic FBI agent who goes undercover to take down a radical white supremacy group.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the mention of several colours, authors such <b>as</b> <b>Walter</b> Rothschild claimed that the Gelderland journal {{described}} the bird as entirely blue-grey, and it was restored this way in Rothschild's 1907 book Extinct Birds. Later examination of the journal by Julian Hume has revealed only {{a description of the}} dodo. He suggested that the distinctively drawn facial mask may represent a separate colour. The head was evidently blue, and in 2007, Hume suggested the beak may have been red, {{and the rest of the}} plumage greyish or blackish, which also occurs in other members of Psittaculini.|$|E
5000|$|Castell Gwallter, {{also known}} <b>as</b> <b>Walter's</b> Castle and {{sometimes}} Castell Penweddig, is {{the remains of}} a Norman motte-and-bailey castle situated on a large hill above the old village of Llandre (Llanfihangel Genau'r Glyn) in northern Ceredigion, Wales, four miles northeast of Aberystwyth.|$|R
5|$|Some critics {{believed}} that {{the name of the}} apartment building, <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>Walter's</b> coin tosses coming up heads, are references to the 1966 tragicomedy Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, which in turn derives from the characters of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, two minor characters in Shakespeare's Hamlet.|$|R

5|$|Originally {{a project}} of real estate {{developer}} and former New York State Senator William H. Reynolds, the structure was built by Walter Chrysler, {{the head of the}} Chrysler Corporation. The Chrysler Building's construction was characterized by a competition with 40 Wall Street and the Empire State Building to become the world's tallest building. The building served as the corporation's headquarters from 1930 until the mid-1950s. Although the building was built and designed specifically for the car manufacturer, the corporation did not pay for its construction and never owned it, <b>as</b> <b>Walter</b> P. Chrysler decided to pay for it himself, so that his children could inherit it.|$|E
5|$|Scholars debate {{when the}} third Lombard–Gepid War started; {{it is agreed}} that it took place {{two years after the}} second war. The {{possible}} dates are either 551 or 552. The 551 date is upheld by those who argue that since in 552 Audoin had already dispatched 5,500 of his warriors to Narses' Italian campaign, the third Lombard–Gepid War must have already ended by then; against this scholars such <b>as</b> <b>Walter</b> Pohl protest that this is in contradiction with Audoin's reproaches to Justinian on the few troops sent against the Gepids, despite his massive support to Narses.|$|E
5|$|The Australian cricket team toured England in 1930. Australia won the five-Test series 2–1, and Donald Bradman scored 974 runs at a {{batting average}} of 139.14, an {{aggregate}} record that still stands in 2017. By {{the time of}} the next Ashes series of 1932–33, Bradman's average hovered around 100, approximately twice that of all other world-class batsmen. The English cricket authorities felt that new tactics would be required to prevent Bradman being even more successful on Australian pitches; some critics believed that Bradman could be dismissed by leg-spin <b>as</b> <b>Walter</b> Robins and Ian Peebles had supposedly caused him problems; two leg-spinners were included in the English touring party of 1932–33.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-1850s, John Walter {{also set}} up the feed mill which is still in {{operation}} <b>as</b> <b>Walters</b> Falls Milling Ltd., still operating on water driven machinery {{most of the year}} with a diesel engine. It suffered a fire in 1923 and was rebuilt on the same site.|$|R
5000|$|A news account said, [...] "The distraught {{woman was}} outraged by Northcott's conduct[...] [...]but was also comforted by it. Northcott's {{ambiguous}} replies and his seeming refusal to remember such details <b>as</b> <b>Walter's</b> clothing {{and the color}} of his eyes gave her continued hope that her son still lived." ...|$|R

5|$|Gaudí's {{professional}} life was distinctive {{in that he}} never ceased to investigate mechanical building structures. Early on, Gaudí was inspired by oriental arts (India, Persia, Japan) through {{the study of the}} historicist architectural theoreticians, such <b>as</b> <b>Walter</b> Pater, John Ruskin and William Morris. The influence of the Oriental movement can be seen in works like the Capricho, the Güell Palace, the Güell Pavilions and the Casa Vicens. Later on, he adhered to the neo-Gothic movement that was in fashion at the time, following the ideas of the French architect Viollet-le-Duc. This influence is reflected in the Teresian College, the Episcopal Palace in Astorga, the Casa Botines and the Bellesguard house {{as well as in the}} crypt and the apse of the Sagrada Família. Eventually, Gaudí embarked on a more personal phase, with the organic style inspired by nature in which he would build his major works.|$|E
5|$|McGann {{was cast}} <b>as</b> <b>Walter</b> Golic to appear with Ralph Brown, his co-star in Withnail and I. Alien 3 Assembly Cut expands on Golic's part in Alien 3, with Golic persuading Morse to unstrap {{him in the}} {{infirmary}} when he hears that the Alien has been trapped. He knocks Morse out, goes to the containment chamber containing the Alien, kills Arthur (who is guarding the door) and releases the creature—which promptly kills him. In an August 1992 Elle magazine article, McGann said that Golic intends to release the Alien {{in the hope that}} he can collaborate with it to kill the humans on Fury 161. Alien 3 editor Terry Rawlings said in the 2003 special-edition DVD release of the Alien Anthology that a parallel exists between Golic and Renfield in Dracula; both are deranged lunatics, who fall under the influence of a paranormal entity which they try to appease.|$|E
5|$|The town {{is still}} largely {{dependent}} on industry, {{along with the}} neighbouring towns Taunton and Bridgwater with manufacturing industries identified within the county economic strategy as key centres for further economic development, due to good transport links. Swallowfield plc benefited from the growth of own-brand products during the 1970s and now produces aerosol, cosmetic and toiletry products. It was founded in 1876 <b>as</b> <b>Walter</b> Gregory & Co Ltd who manufactured animal husbandry products. The company diversified and in 1950 produced the first commercial aerosols in the UK which were basically farm products, air fresheners and insecticides. Bed manufacturers Relyon employ some 400 people. The company started in 1858 as a wool merchant, Price Brothers and Co., but the business soon moved into manufacturing beds and in 1935 {{changed its name to}} Relyon Ltd. In 2001 it was acquired by Steinhoff International Holdings Ltd., a quoted South African group.|$|E
