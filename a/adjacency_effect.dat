The possibility of using inland bodies of water such as rivers, lakes and reservoirs has been recently investigated using the Landsat MSS 7 (approximately 0. 9 micron) channel. This upwelling near-infrared radiance is less influenced than the visible radiance by the suspended matter generally found in the inland bodies of water, and by the <b>adjacency</b> <b>effect</b> of the surrounding higher albedo land.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to enable the removal of developer depletion and diffusion <b>effects</b> (i. e., <b>adjacency</b> <b>effects</b> from noisy photographic images, thus, providing a potential for improvement in the reliability of restored object and aerial image estimates. The investigation was based on the use of a previously formulated image resortation model which characterized the exposure, latent image and development interactions of the photographic process in terms of statistical estimation theory. This study addressed the application and appropriate modification of the formulated model in the removal of <b>adjacency</b> <b>effects</b> from noisy images of selected line targets. Literature pertaining to the initial observations of <b>adjacency</b> <b>effects,</b> their recognition as a nonlinear chemical development effect and the pertinent models (forward) used to predict their effects was reviewed. This was followed with a review of the statistical restoration (inverse) model and its comparison to previously derived forward models. X-ray quanta exposures were then used to obtain noisy photographic images, free of optical scattering effects, for the purpose of empirically determining a chemical spread function to characterize chemical <b>adjacency</b> <b>effects.</b> Photographic images were obtained that contained lines of 0. 010, 0. 100 and 1. 000 mm widths to enable comparison between the magnitude of the chemical spread function and the Eberhard effect. A segmented polynomial (cubic spline function) approach was used to calculate the chemical spread function. Separate light quanta exposures were used to obtain gross grain density sensitometric curves and noisy line images. The covering power relationship between mass of developed silver and diffuse density was empirically derived for Panatomic-X film processed without agitation in D- 76 developer (diluted 1 : 1). Emperical verification of the statistical restoration model was achieved. Chemical <b>adjacency</b> <b>effects</b> were successfully removed from noisy line images using an appropriately scaled version of the statistical restoration model. The spatial frequency content of the noisy line images was approximately 1, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 40 cycles/mm. The proportionality factor, used to scale the chemical spread function required in the restoration model, was found to be equivalent to the ratio of the empirically derived chemical spread function and a magnitude estimate of the Eberhard effect. The maximum diffuse density correction for edge effects was found to be 0. 14, or approximately 11. 1 % of the gross grain density level, 1. 20. Similar diffuse density corrections for fine line images were found to range between 0. 14 and 0. 36, or approximately 11. 1 % to 28. 3 % of the gross grain density level associated with a specific line element...|$|R

40|$|Homogeneous {{surface is}} usually assumed in aerosol {{retrieval}} for the dark target method. Retrieved aerosol optical depth {{can thus be}} overestimated. This error will also be propagated into retrieved surface reflectance during atmospheric correction, especially for high spatial resolution of 8 m for FORMOSAT- 2 (also known as ROCSAT- 2) RSI. The error in retrieved surface reflectance during atmospheric corrections induced by retrieved aerosol optical depth error due to <b>adjacency</b> <b>effect</b> over a dark target is studied in the green and red bands of FORMOSAT- 2 RSI. The results show that significant errors in retrieved surface reflectance, i. e., larger than 0. 01, may occur in most cases except at low contrast for a bright target. Such an error for a dark target is larger than that for a bright target for given contrast and haziness. Relatively, the error of retrieved surface reflectance is enhanced by the introduced error of aerosol optical depth in atmospheric correction for dark targets. The error can be larger than 35 % for dark targets and less than 10 % for bright targets. Hence, {{it is suggested that}} <b>adjacency</b> <b>effect</b> be considered from aerosol optical depth retrieval to surface reflectance retrieval in atmospheric correction except at low contrast for bright targets...|$|E

The knowledge gained from this study {{will be used to}} develop atmospheric correction algorithms and to test them with satellite data. In a theoretical investigation of the relative effects of the aerosol optical thickness, absorption, and size distribution on remote sensing, it was found that aerosol absorption has a significant effect on satellite measurements of surface reflectivity. The absorption effect is stronger for high than for low surface reflectances. The aerosol optical thickness is dominant for small surface reflectances. The accuracy of clustering algorithms depends on both parameters. The vegetation index, however, is affected by the optical thickness but only weakly affected by the absorption. A laboratory simulation of the atmospheric effect on the radiance of sunlight scattered from the Earth's surface-atmosphere system was performed. This experiment verified the existence of the <b>adjacency</b> <b>effect</b> (the effect of a bright field on the radiance detected above a dark field) and was used to test 3 -D radiative transfer models.

Our goal here is to develop a correct measure of distance that would be consistent for in-ternational as well as intra-national trade flows.

W. Schumann which consists of a series of microscopic linear density wedges. The density wedges were made by filling V-cut grooves in a high quality acrylic plastic with a carbon-epoxy dispersion. The density wedges have been produced at the frequencies of 0. 98. cy/mm and 0. 57 cy/mm. These wedges have effective diffuse density ranges between 0. 21 and 1. 18. Their density gradient has been varied from. 28 to 2. 58 density units per mm. The wedges were then tested for their practicality for use in image evaluation. It was found that the characteristic curve for a small image area with a low surrounding density is higher in contrast and shifted to a higher speed when compared to a conventionally produced curve. When the micro scale density wedges were imaged with a high surrounding density, the results were not significantly different from those obtained with the conventional step wedge. There are several drawbacks attributed to the V-groove design that are discussed. The results from the practical application tests, however, suggest that there is significant merit for the micro scale wedges for use in the study of chemical <b>adjacency</b> <b>effects.</b> The micro-scale continuous density wedges are found to present a new concept to sensitometry where the characteristic curve can be related to some of the <b>adjacency</b> <b>effects</b> encountered in specific applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{linearity}} {{of image}} transfer is analyzed {{for a high}} resolution electrophotographic film and electrodeveloper combination. The extent of nonlinearities introduced upon transfer through the photoconduction and electrodevelopment stages is conceptualized in terms of inherent physical mechanisms. A spectral shift in narrow band exposing radiation is used to test significance of exponential absorption on linearity of photoconduction transfer. Variations in development electrode spacing and development time test for nonlinearity induced by temporal and spatial frequency dependent depletion of electrodeveloper particles. As the electrophotographic film employed in the test exhibited low absorption coefficients in all spectral bands, exponential absorption of exposing radiation did not significantly alter linearity of edge image transfer. Results for edge and sinusoidal image transfer indicated nonlinear depletion effects shortly after development initiation. Increased development times reduced <b>adjacency</b> <b>effects</b> for edge distributions and lower harmonic distortions for sinusoidal image distributions.

To improve the robustness of the retrieved properties, REGFLEC was modified to 1) correct for aerosol and <b>adjacency</b> <b>effects,</b> 2) consider foliar dust effects on modeled canopy reflectances, 3) include spectral information in the red-edge wavelength region, and 4) exploit empirical LAI estimates in the model inversion. Using multi-spectral RapidEye imagery allowed Chll to be retrieved with a Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of 7. 9 μg cm− 2 (16 %), based upon in-situ measurements conducted in fields of alfalfa, Rhodes grass and maize {{over the course of a}} growing season. LAI and Chll compensation effects on canopy reflectance were largely avoided by informing the inversion process with ancillary LAI inputs established empirically on the basis of a statistical machine learning technique. As a result, LAI was reproduced with good accuracy, with an overall MAD of 0. 42 m 2 m− 2 (12. 5 %). Results highlighted the considerable challenges associated with the translation of at-sensor radiance observations to surface bidirectional reflectances in dryland environments, where issues such as high aerosol loadings and large spatial gradients in surface reflectance from bright desert soils to dark vegetated fields are often present. Indeed, surface reflectances in the visible bands were reduced by up to 60 % after correction for such <b>adjacency</b> <b>effects.</b> In addition, dust deposition on leaves required explicit modification of the reflectance sub-model to account for its influence.

Two different correction procedures are considered: not deriving (AC- 1) or alter- natively deriving (AC- 2) the atmospheric properties from the remote sensing data. In both cases, biases due to <b>adjacency</b> <b>effects</b> largely increase by approaching the coast and with the satellite viewing angle. Conversely, the seasonal and spectral dependence of biases significantly differ between AC- 1 and AC- 2 schemes. For AC- 1 schemes average biases are within 5 % throughout the transect at yellow–green wavelengths, but at the coast they can reach − 21 % and 34 % at 412 and 670 nm, respectively, and exceed 100 % at 865 nm. For AC- 2 schemes, <b>adjacency</b> <b>effects</b> at those wavelengths from which atmospheric properties are inferred add significant perturbations. For the specific case of a correction scheme determining the atmospheric properties from the near-infrared region and by adopting a power-law spectral extrapolation of adjacency perturbations on the derived atmospheric radiance, average biases become all negative with values up to − 60 % and − 74 % at 412 and 670 nm at the coast, respectively. The seasonal trend of estimated biases at the AAOT is consistent with intra-annual variation of biases from match- ups between in situ and satellite products derived with SeaDAS from SeaWiFS and MODIS data.
