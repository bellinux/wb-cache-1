5|$|Oscar Wilde, a {{critical}} study by Arthur Ransome {{was published in}} 1912. The book only briefly mentioned Wilde's life, but subsequently Ransome (and The Times Book Club) were sued for libel by Lord Alfred Douglas. The trial in April 1913 was in a way a re-run of the trials of Oscar Wilde. The trial resulted from Douglas's rivalry with Robbie Ross for Wilde (and his need of money). Douglas lost after <b>a</b> <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> De Profundis refuted his claims.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{following}} the College Walk festivities {{is one of}} Columbia's older holiday traditions, the lighting of the Yule Log. The Christmas ceremony dates to a period prior to the American Revolutionary War, but lapsed before being revived by University President Nicholas Murray Butler in the early 20th century. A troop of students dressed as Continental Army soldiers carry the eponymous log from the sun-dial to the lounge of John Jay Hall, where it is lit amid the singing of seasonal carols. The Christmas ceremony is accompanied by <b>a</b> <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> A Visit From St. Nicholas by Clement Clarke Moore and Yes, Virginia, There is a Santa Claus by Francis Pharcellus Church.|$|E
5|$|The nine-year-old Edward {{wrote to}} his father and {{stepmother}} on 10 January 1547 from Hertford thanking them for his new year's gift of their portraits from life. By 28 January 1547, Henry VIII was dead. Those close to the throne, led by Edward Seymour and William Paget, agreed to delay {{the announcement of the}} king's death until arrangements had been made for a smooth succession. Seymour and Sir Anthony Browne, the Master of the Horse, rode to collect Edward from Hertford and brought him to Enfield, where Lady Elizabeth was living. He and Elizabeth were then told of the death of their father and heard <b>a</b> <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> the will.|$|E
5|$|List {{believed}} that the degradation of modern Western society was {{as a result of}} a conspiracy orchestrated by a secret organisation known as the Great International Party, an idea influenced by anti-semitic conspiracy theories. Adopting a millenarianist perspective, he believed in the imminent defeat of this enemy and the establishment of a better future for the Ario-German race. In April 1915 he welcomed the start of World War I as a conflict that would bring about the defeat of Germany's enemies and the establishment of a golden age for the new Ario-German Empire. Toward the war's end, he {{believed that}} the German war dead would be reincarnated as a generation who would push through with a national revolution and establish this new, better society. For List, this better future would be intricately connected to the ancient past, reflecting his belief in the cyclical nature of time, something which he had adopted both from <b>a</b> <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> Norse mythology and from Theosophy. Reflecting his monarchist beliefs, he envisioned this future state as being governed by the House of Habsburg, with a revived feudal system of land ownership being introduced through which land would be inherited by a man's eldest son. In List's opinion, this new empire would be highly hierarchical, with non-Aryans being subjugated under the Aryan population and opportunities for education and jobs in public service being restricted to those deemed racially pure. He envisioned this Empire following the Wotanic religion which he promoted.|$|E

40|$|In this article, I {{contribute}} to the wider discourse of theorizing feminism in predominantly Muslim societies by analyzing the role of women’s political agency within {{the writings of the}} twelfth-century Islamic philosopher Averroës (Ibn Rushd, 1126 – 1198). I critically analyze Catarina Belo’s (2009) liberal feminist approach to political agency in Averroës by adopting <b>a</b> postmodern <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> Averroës’s commentary on Plato’s Republic. <b>A</b> postmodern feminist <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> Averroes’s political thought emphasizes contingencies and contextualization rather than employing <b>a</b> literal <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> the historical works...|$|R
40|$|Prospero’s {{renunciation}} {{of his book}} in The Tempest acknowledges its power {{as a kind of}} ‘fetish’. This essay traces the idea of the book as ‘commodity fetish’ and as material text. The argument examines how post-Marxist thought, in <b>a</b> new <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> Louis Althusser,might be used to challenge the Shakespeare of late capitalism. It suggests how <b>a</b> complex <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> the fetish in historiography, combining a history of the material book in Shakespeare, with <b>a</b> theoretical <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> WilliamPietz, Stephen Greenblatt and Peter Stallybrass, sheds light on the First Folio, {{one of the most famous}} – and fetishized – books in history...|$|R
