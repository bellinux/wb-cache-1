500|$|For King Robert the Bruce of Scotland, {{the spider}} is {{depicted}} as an inspirational symbol, according to an early 14th-century legend. [...] The legend tells of Robert the Bruce's encounter with a spider {{during the time of}} a series of military failures against the English. One version tells that while taking refuge in a cave on Rathlin Island, he witnesses a spider continuously failing to climb its silken thread to its web. However, due to perseverance the spider eventually succeeds, demonstrating that, [...] "if <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>you</b> don't succeed, try, try and try again". [...] Taking this as being symbolic of hope and perseverance, Bruce came out of hiding and eventually won Scotland's independence.|$|E

2500|$|An anti-proverb or a perverb is the {{transformation}} of a standard proverb for humorous effect. Paremiologist Wolfgang Mieder defines them as [...] "parodied, twisted, or fractured proverbs that reveal humorous or satirical speech play with traditional proverbial wisdom". They have also been defined as [...] "an allusive distortion, parody, misapplication, or unexpected contextualization of a recognized proverb, usually for comic or satiric effect". To have full effect, an anti-proverb {{must be based on}} a known proverb. For example, [...] "If <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>you</b> don't succeed, quit" [...] is only funny if the hearer knows the standard proverb [...] "If <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>you</b> don't succeed, try, try again". Anti-proverbs are used commonly in advertising, such as [...] "Put your burger where your mouth is" [...] from Red Robin. Anti-proverbs are also common on T-shirts, such as [...] "Taste makes waist" [...] and [...] "If <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>you</b> don't succeed, skydiving is not for you".|$|E
