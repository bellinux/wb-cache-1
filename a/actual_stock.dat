500|$|After denying to a {{reporter}} just {{a month before the}} election that he had a Crédit Mobilier connection, Wilson admitted involvement when he gave testimony before a Senate committee on February 13, 1873. [...] Wilson told members of the investigating committee that in December 1867 he had agreed to purchase $2,000 in Crédit Mobilier stock (20 shares) using Mrs. Wilson's money and in her name. [...] According to Wilson, his wife and he later had concerns about the propriety of the transaction and had never taken possession of the <b>actual</b> <b>stock</b> certificates, so Wilson asked Ames to cancel the transaction and Ames refunded the $2,000 purchase price to Wilson. [...] Wilson said he then returned $814 to Ames – $748 in dividends and $66 in interest that Mrs. Wilson had supposedly earned as profits, even though she had not taken physical possession of her shares. [...] Wilson further claimed that because Mrs. Wilson had refused to take these proceeds from Ames, Wilson took it upon himself to pay her $814 from his own funds to compensate her for the profit she would have made if she had kept the stock, which he said he felt obligated to do because his wife had originally agreed to purchase the stock on his recommendation, and had lost money by following his later recommendation to cancel the transaction.|$|E

Currently, the Indian banking sector is one of fastest growing sector and all major banks have been included in S&P BANKEX index. The financial econometric approach includes GARCH (1, 1) model which is performed in order to capture asymmetric volatility clustering and leptokurtosis. Data time lag is considered from the first transaction day of January 2002 to last transaction day of June 2014. Empirical outcomes suggest that volatility shocks in series and volatility clusters.

40|$|Unlike {{several other}} farm animal species, the broiler chicken remains {{unprotected}} by species-specific legislation. The densities at which broilers {{should be kept}} is a highly contentious issue-some studies have demonstrated increased welfare problems at higher densities, whilst a few others have, contrary to expectations, suggested that broilers may actually find crowds of other birds attractive. A tracking method was developed and used to provide an insight into the social preferences of commercial broiler chickens in situ-inside commercial, closed-system broiler houses. The aim was to simultaneously assess the relative impact of global measures of density, such as target and <b>actual</b> <b>stocking</b> densities and local measures of the social environment on the behaviour and route taken to feed by focal birds. Birds were tracked inside 20 commercial broiler houses across the UK. Results from this study show that stocking density per se seems to have little direct effect on the individual behaviours of focal broiler chickens. However, there may still be an indirect effect of stocking density on broiler behaviour, mediated through the local social environment. Â© 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

5000|$|An {{important}} {{characteristic of}} this kind of convertible debt is that it often carries conditions like a quarterly or semiannual reset of the conversion price to keep the conversion price more or less close to the <b>actual</b> <b>stock</b> price. However, a lower conversion price also increases the number of shares that a bond holder gets in exchange for one bond, which increases the dilution of existing shareholders. A lower price reset can also force investors that have set up a long CB/short stock position to sell more stock ("adjust the delta"), creating a vicious circle, hence the nickname death spiral.|$|E

40|$|Using {{inadequate}} management tools often {{threatens the}} natural environment. This study {{focuses on the}} example of Swiss recreational fishermen (hereafter called "anglers") as recreational fisheries management stakeholders. In recreational fisheries, fish stocking conducted by anglers {{has been identified as}} one important factor associated with declining fish catches. We therefore aimed to a) gain insights into why anglers want to maintain fish stocking and b) identify entry points for interventions to promote more pro-ecological management practices. Results (N =  349) showed that the majority of anglers think very uncritically about stocking and that they frequently engage in it. We conclude that outcome expectancies and beliefs about risks, in combination with a lack of stocking success controls are the main reasons that anglers retain stocking measures. We suggest that providing anglers with direct experience and feedback about stocking success is suitable to change their intentions regarding <b>stocking</b> and their <b>actual</b> <b>stocking</b> behavior, and thus, to promote more pro-ecological management methods. From a more general perspective, {{the results of this study}} are likely to help improve pro-ecological ecosystem management in other domains where problems similar to those in recreational fisheries management might exist...|$|R

Shares on popular media such as music, movies and celebrities could also be traded. Like the <b>actual</b> <b>stock</b> exchange, the market price of a stock was determined by the number of shares traded for that stock.

The objective of the game was to earn as much Silver - the main currency in FameLeague - as possible, by making accurate forecasts while purchasing prediction stocks, and through ability to anticipate which stocks would become more popular on FameLeague when purchasing stock on friends, celebrities or media.|$|E
50|$|Mildly bullish trading {{strategies}} are options that make money {{as long as}} the underlying stock price does not go down by the option's expiration date. These strategies may provide downside protection as well. Writing out-of-the-money covered calls {{is a good example of}} such a strategy. However, Covered Calls usually require the trader to buy <b>actual</b> <b>stock</b> in the end which needs to be taken into account for margin. This is why it's called a covered call. The trader is buying an option to cover the stock you have already purchased. This is how traders hedge a stock that they own when it has gone against them for a period of time. The stock market is much more than ups and downs, buying, selling, calls, and puts. Options give the trader flexibility to really make a change and career out of what some call a dangerous or rigid market or profession.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an attempt to provide a {{theoretical}} and empirical model of the reserve holding behaviour of developing countries {{in the context of their}} efforts at economic development. In principle, the basic determinants of desired level of reserves turn out to be not only the levels of such variables as exports, aid/capital flows, lines of credit and the opportunity cost of holding reserves, but also the standard deviation of these variables. In order to make the theory amenable to empirical testing, use is made of an adjustment mechanism by which countries adjust their <b>actual</b> <b>stocks</b> of reserves to their desired levels in terms of a distributed lag analysis. Using data for the 1951 - 1965 period, our empirical analysis indicates that, on the average, developing countries are able to complete only less than half of the desired change in their reserves each year; that the reserve-import ratio is a more reasonable decision variable than the absolute level of reserves; and that, in the short run, the critical determinants are past reserve holdings and the current level of the ratio of capital goods imports to total imports, a "development" variable used as a proxy for the opportunity cost of holding reserves. On individual country basis, however, the above generalizations break down...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{broilers}} {{must have}} an access to an outdoor-run as specified in European Council regulations on organic farming. Yet, the impact of animals on the outdoor-run is unknown. The objective {{of this study was}} to estimate the influence of organic broiler production on the soils of two contrasting outdoor-runs (grassland vs. oak grove) regarding the stocks of C, N, P, Cu and Zn. 25 composite samples were composed for each outdoor-run. The initial stocks of C, N, P, Cu and Zn were determined for two horizons by measuring bulk density and total or available elements content. The excretion of C, N, P, Cu and Zn of broilers was estimated with French references and compared to detections thresholds calculated from initial stock values in order to determine whether significant stock variations could be detectable or not. C and N initial stocks vary correlatively in space and are higher in the oak grove soil. P stocks are important with a great spatial variability. Cu and Zn stocks are similar in both outdoorruns and beyond national standards. The theoretical variations in C, N and P stocks will be detectable whereas Cu and Zn stock variations will be not. The final <b>actual</b> <b>stocks</b> of C, N, P, Cu and Zn will be measured with the same method and compared to the results presented in this study...|$|R
