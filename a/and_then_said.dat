25|$|The Healing {{the deaf}} mute of Decapolis miracle only {{appears in the}} Gospel of Mark. The Gospel states that Jesus went to the Decapolis and met a man there who was deaf and mute, and cured him. Specifically, Jesus first touched the man's ears, and touched his tongue after spitting, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>said</b> Ephphatha!, an Aramaic word meaning Be opened.|$|E
500|$|Bouchard was unafraid {{to speak}} his {{mind when he}} felt the {{occasion}} demanded. In 1957, after an International League game in Toronto between his Montreal Royals and the Maple Leafs baseball team President Bouchard complained about Toronto's excessive conference trips to the mound. He called the Leafs [...] "showspoilers" [...] <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>said,</b> for the entire press room to hear, [...] "They're a lot of punks, just like in hockey!" ...|$|E
500|$|The federal {{government}} was eventually liable for $3.4 billion to cover Lincoln's losses when it seized the institution. In talking to reporters in April 1989, Keating maintained {{that he was the}} victim of a {{federal government}} that had spent years trying to destroy him, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "One question, among many raised in recent weeks, had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause. I want to say in the most forceful way I can: I certainly hope so." ...|$|E

500|$|Bathory {{described}} Five Finger Death Punch as [...] "a straight-up {{heavy metal}} band {{with a hint}} of thrash metal — maybe a hint of the Euro stuff in there" [...] <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "that's pretty much what we are". Spencer described Five Finger Death Punch as [...] "kind of like stepping on a garden rake while looking at a supermodel. Blissful yet fucking devastating". He then said, [...] "We have an energy and a rhythmical style that's different than what's happening out there. We have songs that grab you and stay with you and rip your face off. Hooks, balls, melodies and energy — that's us".|$|E
500|$|In 1985 Dylan sang on USA for Africa's famine relief single [...] "We Are the World". He {{also joined}} Artists United Against Apartheid {{providing}} vocals for their single [...] "Sun City". On July 13, 1985, he {{appeared at the}} climax at the Live Aid concert at JFK Stadium, Philadelphia. Backed by Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood, he performed a ragged version of [...] "Hollis Brown", his ballad of rural poverty, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>said</b> to the worldwide audience exceeding one billion people: [...] "I hope {{that some of the}} money... maybe they can just {{take a little bit of}} it, maybe... one or two million, maybe... and use it to pay the mortgages on some of the farms and, the farmers here, owe to the banks." [...] His remarks were widely criticized as inappropriate, but they did inspire Willie Nelson to organize a series of events, Farm Aid, to benefit debt-ridden American farmers.|$|E
500|$|Taylor summoned Khánh to his office, but the Vietnamese leader sent Thi, Kỳ, Thiệu and Admiral Chung Tấn Cang, the {{commander}} of the Republic of Vietnam Navy, instead. Taylor asked the four to sit down <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Do all of you understand English?" [...] The ambassador then angrily denounced the officers. According to Stanley Karnow, Taylor [...] "launched into a tirade, scolding them as if he were still superintendent of West Point and they a group of cadets caught cheating". He said [...] "I told you all clearly at General Westmoreland's dinner we Americans were tired of coups. Apparently I wasted my words." [...] He decried the removal of the HNC as [...] "totally illegal", and said it had [...] "destroyed the government-making process", and that [...] "I made it clear that all the military plans I know you would like to carry out are dependent on government stability", something he felt had been lost with the dismissal of the HNC. He said [...] "...you have made a real mess. We cannot carry you forever if you do things like this." [...] Taylor believed the HNC to be {{an essential part of the}} government, because as an American, he believed civilian legitimacy was a must. For him, the HNC was a necessary step in a progression towards an elected civilian legislature, which he regarded as critical for national and military morale. The historian Mark Moyar regarded Taylor's intervention as unnecessary, and noted that there had been many instances of fierce fighting in Vietnamese history despite the complete absence of democracy throughout the nation's history. Taylor also reminded them of an earlier meeting where he had discussed an American plan to expand the war, increase funding for the South Vietnamese military, and to go on the offensive against the communists at the request of Khánh. Taylor said the Americans would not be able to help Saigon pursue their desired military strategy if the political machinations did not stop. Taylor said that if the military did not transfer some powers or advisory capacity back to the HNC or another civilian institution, aid would be withheld, and some planned military operations against the Ho Chi Minh trail—which was being used to infiltrate communists into the south—would be suspended.|$|E

[...] "Admittedly petitioner's case {{is different from}} Russell's but the difference is one of degree, not of kind". He conceded that the government's role, {{at least in the}} defense case, was more significant but stuck with the admitted predisposition towards drug dealing in rejecting any entrapment claim. Again, he decisively rejected any effort to assert the objective standard.|$|E
2500|$|Al Miller, Chairman of the Toledo Forum, {{asked me}} to come to his office. He greeted me pleasantly <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "As you know, I am {{attorney}} for the Toledo Chamber of Commerce, on a permanent retainer. I am their legal spokesman; they are among my clients. They have directed me to introduce a resolution at the next meeting of the Toledo university trustees, ending your connection with the institution."

2500|$|According to Inner City Press, [...] "Bronx-based Fair Finance Watch commented to the Federal Reserve {{about the}} {{practices}} of now-defunct non-bank subprime lender New Century, when U.S. Bancorp bought warrants for 24% of New Century's stock. The Fed, rather than take any action on New Century, merely waited until U.S. Bancorp sold {{off some of the}} warrants, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>said</b> the issue was moot." [...] However, subprime loans were so profitable, that they were aggressively marketed in low-and moderate-income communities, even over the objections and warnings of housing advocacy groups like ACORN.|$|E

2500|$|In court, Blount {{said that}} {{alternate}} service was unacceptable; he debated the judge on points {{of law and}} Biblical interpretation. Though sympathetic, the judge ruled that Blount was violating the law and was at risk for being drafted into the U.S. military. Blount responded that if inducted, he would use military weapons and training to kill the first high-ranking military officer possible. The judge sentenced Blount to jail (pending draft board and CPS rulings), <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I've never seen a nigger like you before."

2500|$|When later {{asked why}} he invaded Kuwait, Saddam first claimed {{that it was because}} Kuwait was {{rightfully}} Iraq's 19th province <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>said</b> [...] "When I get something into my head I act.

Needless to say, the sound he heard was totally {{different}} from the one he produced. De Sabata, without uttering a word, asserted his dominance of the orchestra just by standing there". When Herbert von Karajan was making his own recording of Tosca in 1962, he would often ask his producer John Culshaw to play selections from the de Sabata/Callas recording to him. Culshaw reports that [...] "One exceptionally tricky passage for the conductor is the entry of Tosca in act 3, where Puccini's tempo directions can best be described as elastic. Karajan listened to de Sabata several times over during that passage <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>said,</b> 'No, he's right but I can't do that. That's his secret.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Actor Matthew Gravelle (who played murderer Joe Miller) was {{the second}} cast member to learn the killer's identity.

Chibnall kept his revelation short, saying, [...] "It's you." [...] Gravelle paused for about 20 seconds, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Oh, brilllllliant." [...] He was very enthused {{to be able to play}} what were going to be critical scenes at the end of the series. But he also admitted he had never guessed he was going to be the killer. Over the next few days, Chibnall and Gravelle had many long conversations to discuss Joe Miller's backstory and motivation, how to integrate the filmed performance with the upcoming performance, and how Gravelle could play the character going forward.|$|E

He introduced Taylor, who merely nodded a greeting, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Well done, then, Goodbye," [...] and left. Epstein and Taylor went to Peacock's restaurant in Hackins Hey for lunch, and during the meal Epstein asked Taylor {{what he thought about}} the group.
