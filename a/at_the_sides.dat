5|$|The female {{has four}} pairs of teats, {{including}} {{one on the}} chest and three on the belly, and the gall bladder is absent, both important characters of Oryzomyini. As is characteristic of Sigmodontinae, Pseudoryzomys has a complex penis, with the baculum (penis bone) displaying large protuberances <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides.</b> In the cartilaginous part of the baculum, the central digit is smaller than those <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides.</b>|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from these}} grand state buildings, {{there are also}} several minor {{structures}} and pavilions surrounding the Phra Maha Monthien structures. These include four smaller halls <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of the Amarin Winitchai Throne hall.|$|E
5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of Sigmodontinae, Transandinomys talamancae has a complex penis, with the distal (far) end of the baculum (penis bone) ending in a structure consisting of three digits. As in most oryzomyines, the central digit {{is larger than the}} two <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides.</b> The outer surface of the penis is mostly covered by small spines, but there is a broad band of nonspinous tissue.|$|E

It is a loose white undergarment of fine linen cloth edged with a lace border, open <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides,</b> sleeveless and cut low at the neck. It symbolises the derivation of royal authority from the people.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} {{to those of}} Tachyoryctes audax, the nasal bones are larger and have angles <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides.</b> T.annectens, which is nearly as large, has smaller teeth and nasals; in T.rex, the basioccipital is broader, and the back part of the mandible (lower jaw) is better developed and has the capsule of the incisor placed further to the front.|$|E
5|$|In {{some areas}} of the world, {{including}} Berlin, Germany, dropping salt is prohibited altogether except on the highest-risk roads; plain sand without any melting agents is spread instead. While this may protect the environment, it is more labour-intensive, as more gritting runs are needed; because the sand is insoluble, it tends to accumulate <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of the road, making it more difficult for buses to pull in at bus stops.|$|E

5|$|The {{blood in}} the deep {{part of the brain}} drains, through a venous plexus into the {{cavernous}} sinus at the front, and the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides,</b> and the inferior sagittal sinus at the back. Blood drains from the outer brain into the large superior saggital sinus, which rests in the midline on top of the brain. Blood from here joins with blood from the straight sinus at the confluence of sinuses.|$|E
5|$|The front (rostral) part of {{the skull}} is shortshorter and broader than in T.hylophilusand flat and the notches in the {{zygomatic}} plates <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> are poorly developed. The plates themselves are broad. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) spread broadly and are rounded in shape. The narrow interorbital region (between the eyes) is hourglass-shaped. The braincase is robust.|$|E
5|$|The skull is {{somewhat}} {{smaller than that}} of N.matroka and the braincase and palate are narrower. Compared to N.somalica, the skull is broader. The ridge on the lacrimal bone is better developed, the palate is broader, the frontal bones contain a depression and are swollen <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides,</b> the mastoid bones are smaller, and the coronoid and angular processes of the mandible (lower jaw) are more prominent.|$|E

5|$|The tail appears {{naked and}} is shorter than or {{about as long}} as the head and body; it is longer in T.talamancae. Its {{coloration}} is variable; it is dark brown above and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> and light brown and often white to a greater or smaller extent below, and in some specimens the tail has the same color above and below. The scales on the tail are smaller than in T.talamancae.|$|E
5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of Sigmodontinae, the marsh rice rat and O.couesi have a complex penis, with the baculum (penis bone) displaying large protuberances <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides.</b> The outer surface of the penis is mostly covered by small spines, {{but there is a}} broad band of nonspinous tissue. The papilla (nipple-like projection) on the dorsal (upper) side of the penis is covered with small spines, a character these two species share only with Oligoryzomys among oryzomyines examined. On the urethral process, located in the crater {{at the end of the}} penis, a fleshy process (the subapical lobule) is present; it is absent in all other oryzomyines with studied penes except Holochilus brasiliensis. Both traits are recovered as synapomorphies of O.couesi plus the marsh rice rat in Weksler's analysis.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the large}} pendentives {{that support the}} vault are windows, six {{on each side of}} the chapel. There were two more windows in each end of the chapel, now closed, and those above the High Altar covered by the Last Judgement. Above each window is an arched shape, {{referred}} to as a lunette and above eight of the lunettes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of the chapel are triangular spandrels filling the spaces between the side pendentives and the vault, the other eight lunettes each being below one of the corner pendentives.|$|E

5|$|Dolphins have sharp eyesight. The {{eyes are}} located <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> {{of the head}} and have a tapetum lucidum, or {{reflecting}} membrane, {{at the back of the}} retina, which aids vision in dim light. Their horseshoe-shaped, double-slit pupils enable dolphins to have good vision both in air and underwater, despite the different indices of refraction of these media. When under water, the eyeball's lens serves to focus light, whereas in the in-air environment, the typically bright light serves to contract the specialized pupil, resulting in sharpness from a smaller aperture (similar to a pinhole camera).|$|E
5|$|Ivall's Cottage, a Grade II listed {{building}} since 1985, is located opposite the post box {{near the village}} green. The cottage was originally built during the 16th century, with late 18th century and early 19th century additions with contemporary extensions <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides.</b> The cottage is built from red brick and flint in Flemish bond, with cambered openings {{on the ground floor}} with a part-thatched, part-tiled roof. The roof is hipped at the west end, with lower eaves at the rear intercepted by eyebrow dormers.|$|E
5|$|Other {{features}} of the skull distinguish the two genera. The tegmen tympani, {{the roof of the}} tympanic cavity, is much reduced in Voalavo relative to Eliurus. The subsquamosal fenestrae, openings in the squamosal bone {{at the back of the}} skull, are larger in Voalavo than in Eliurus. The zygomatic plate, a plate <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of the skull that roots the front part of the zygomatic arches (cheekbones), is narrower in Voalavo, and lacks a clear zygomatic notch (a notch formed by a projection at the front of the zygomatic plate), which is present in Eliurus. Among nesomyines, only Brachytarsomys has a more reduced zygomatic notch.|$|E

5|$|Sudirman died in Magelang at 18:30 on 29January 1950; {{this was}} {{reported}} in a special broadcast over RRI. Upon receiving news of his death, the Sudirman family home received numerous visitors, including {{the entirety of the}} 9thBrigade, which was stationed nearby. The following morning Sudirman's body was brought to Yogyakarta. As the funeral convoy passed, led by four tanks and consisting of eighty motor vehicles, thousands of mourners stood <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of the streets. The convoy was organised by members of the 9thBrigade.|$|E
5|$|The {{body can}} be divided into three parts – the cephalon (head), the pereon (thorax), and the abdomen. The pereon {{comprises}} most of the length of the body. It is divided into seven segments known as pereonites. The rounded and smooth cephalon is fused to the first pereonite; while the highly reduced and almost invisible abdomen is attached to the posterior of the seventh pereonite. In males the first two pereonites are elongated, with the second pereonite being the longest of all the pereonites. They are densely covered with long setae (bristles), giving them a hairy appearance. The second pereonite also has two to three pairs of spines on the back, with an additional two pairs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> near the base of the limbs. The remaining pereonites (third to seventh) lack the dense setae of the first two pereonites. The third pereonite has seven pairs of spines at the back while the fourth pereonite has eight pairs. Both have three to seven pairs of spines near the base of the gills. The fifth pereonite has five pairs of back spines and a pair of spines <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides.</b> The sixth and seventh pereonites each have two pairs of back spines, situated at their centers and near the posterior. Females differ from males in having much shorter pereonites which lack the dense covering of setae. The cephalon and first pereonite also possess a single pair of spines each, though they can sometimes be absent.|$|E
5|$|The {{face and}} {{surrounding}} areas, including the lores, supercilium, ear-coverts, cheeks and throat are a white buff-orange. Below, the belly and breast are a rich cinnamon, darkening to an orange-cinnamon <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of the breast. The rear flanks and undertail-covert feathers are rufous. In worn plumage, the color may be uneven {{in the lower}} parts and lighter in hue. The upper mandible of the bill is black, and the lower is gray with a black tip. The iris and legs are dark brown. Juveniles of the species resemble adults but for the base of their beaks being yellow, proportionately shorter, and their overall coloring being less vibrant.|$|E
