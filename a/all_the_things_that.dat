5|$|I {{think it}} was really special to have behind-the-scenes photos, you know, {{pictures}} that the fans haven't seen before, all together of a very specific moment of my life, an album of my life. They just get to see <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> they hadn't seen {{that were going on}} behind the scenes; really cool stuff, not typical. They're really fun photos. And even for me, when I look at them, they say so much. Photos really tell a thousand words.|$|E
5|$|It {{just seems}} like a feel-good record but when you really listen to the lyrics, it's about me growing up. In my household, I didn't go all of the parties and I didn't do <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> {{a lot of the}} other teenage girls did because I was so in love with my radio and my music. I was so in love with this radio and my parents were happy that I was into {{something}} positive.|$|E

25|$|The {{first episode}} of Chef! was {{developed}} over two years, and so Peter Tilbury and I were really put through loads of hoops about character motivation. Why is this character such an arsehole? Is this {{the right kind}} of character for Lenny Henry to be playing? All that kind of stuff. Once we got through that and they greenlit the series, Peter then had something like eight or nine weeks to write the rest of it. The remaining five episodes were much easier to write because we'd had every argument about who, what, where, and how. The world had been mapped out. Actually, the very first episode of Chef! was the hardest one to watch for me because we'd worked so hard on it and you could see <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> had been rewritten in the first episode.|$|E
500|$|<b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> {{happened}} {{were really}} inspiring, {{because it was}} frustrating ... But for me at least, every time we get really frustrated and you're hitting a wall and everything is chaos, it just makes the music that much better, because you have passion—even if it's negative. That's sometimes better, actually.|$|E
500|$|.....just doing {{anything}} {{we felt like}} doing at the time. The engineer we used, Rhett Davies, also did Diamond Head and 801 Live and Quiet Sun, so it was like family. There {{was a lot of}} experimenting and a lot of hours spent with Brian Eno, me, and Rhett in the control room doing <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> eventually evolved into those cards, the Oblique Strategies, {{and it was just a}} lot of fun.|$|E

He thought it absurd, {{after he had}} reformed, and altered, and improved everywhere, to suit my notions, that I still remained unsatisfied. The fact was, it was, after <b>all,</b> <b>the</b> <b>THING</b> <b>that</b> I hated--the using these men and women, <b>the</b> perpetuation of <b>all</b> this ignorance, brutality and vice,--just to make money for me! ...|$|R
500|$|... {{was like}} a trip down memory lane, looking back at {{everything}} I've accomplished {{and all the things}} I once valued and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> were important to me. What is my perspective now? I've fought for so many things, I've tried so hard to be number one and to stay on top, to look good, to be the best.

500|$|Blyton's {{range of}} plots and {{settings}} {{has been described}} as limited and continually recycled. Responding to claims that her moral views were [...] "dependably predictable", Blyton commented that [...] "most of you could write down perfectly correctly <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> I believe in and stand for– you have found them in my books, and a writer's books are always a faithful reflection of himself". Many of her books were critically assessed by teachers and librarians, deemed unfit for children to read, and removed from syllabuses and public libraries.|$|E
500|$|Once {{the family}} had resettled in Enugu, Achebe and his friend Christopher Okigbo started a {{publishing}} house called Citadel Press, {{to improve the quality}} and increase the quantity of literature available to younger readers. One of its first submissions was a story called How the Dog was Domesticated, which Achebe revised and rewrote, turning it into a complex allegory for the country's political tumult. Its final title was How the Leopard Got His Claws. Years later a Nigerian intelligence officer told Achebe, [...] "of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> came out of Biafra, that book was the most important." ...|$|E

[...] "Living in Ann Arbor, and seeing <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> embody a great university, you learned that there were highly successful people in athletics, and it just {{made you want to}} feel a part of it. Then, as you got older, and you got more deeply involved in the game yourself, you just hoped that {{you had a chance to}} play in college -- and after watching all those games at Michigan Stadium, that maybe Michigan would take a chance on you." ...|$|E
500|$|The 278 Beti chiefs under Atangana's control {{began to}} oppose his primacy by the mid-1920s. His control fell {{especially}} among the Bane. In 1924, the Bane filed a complaint against Atangana in court, claiming, [...] "We work always and it is Atangana who receives the money. For <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> we have sent to the Europeans, such as chickens and eggs, through Atangana, we have received nothing." [...] They plotted to raise their own paramount chief and to drum up sentiment against Atangana among the common people. The French arrested the plotters for refusing to pay their taxes and provide labourers. This left Atangana still head of the Bane, but his influence had been severely curtailed.|$|E
500|$|Frank Spotnitz {{said of the}} episode's origins, [...] "We've {{destroyed}} all {{the stuff}} about Mulder's father, the project, and the Syndicate. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> had sustained us for six years were suddenly gone. We had no crutches. From that point on, every time we sat down to write a mythology show, {{we knew it was}} going to be a completely different challenge." [...] Chris Carter saw the episode as a transitional episode, stating [...] "I felt that, with [...] "The Sixth Extinction", I was just playing a supporting role and that the episode, essentially the middle episode of a three-episode arc, was just a transitional episode to get us to '', which was really less about the mythology and more about Mulder's choices in life." ...|$|E

500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode an [...] "A–", {{arguing that it}} was an example of the series' {{continued}} growth: he wrote, [...] "as Finn grows, so does this series". Sava opined that, [...] "the final minute of “Billy’s Bucket List” drops a major plot-bomb that gives the series an exciting direction for next season, and while the events leading up to the cliffhanger aren't quite as provocative or substantial as the last few episodes, they represent <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> make this show such a great 10-minute oasis {{at the beginning of the}} week." [...] Sava also noted that, [...] "Trippy psychedelia is another major ingredient of this series, and 'Billy’s Bucket List' delivers a heavy serving when Finn finds himself underwater." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Gloaming (Softly Open our Mouths in the Cold)" [...] is an {{electronic}} song with [...] "mechanical rhythms" [...] that Jonny Greenwood built from tape loops. Greenwood {{described it as}} [...] "very old school electronica: no computers, just analogue synths, tape machines, and sellotape." [...] Yorke felt the song was [...] "the most explicit protest song on the record... I feel really strongly that it's about the rise of fascism, {{and the rise of}} intolerance and bigotry and fear, and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> keep a population down." [...] "There There (The Boney King of Nowhere)" [...] is a guitar-led rock song with layered percussion building to a loud climax. It was influenced by krautrock band Can, Siouxsie and the Banshees and the Pixies.|$|E
500|$|Will & Grace creators and {{executive}} producers David Kohan and Max Mutchnick, {{who had not}} served as writers since the season four season finale, wrote the script for the series finale. Regarding the finale, Mutchnick stated: [...] "We wrote {{about what you want}} to have happen with people you love. I think Will and Grace end up very fleshed out. They end up as full adults. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> matter in life, they end up having." [...] Three years before the series finale was created, Mutchnick was asked on his opinion regarding how {{he would like to see}} the character's story come to a conclusion, [...] "The truth is that [...] serve each other's dysfunction. And the best way for their story to end is to find love." ...|$|E

60|$|If reapers sing while reaping, {{why should}} not {{auditors}} sing while auditing and bankers while banking?

As the train from Dover flew through the Kentish gardens, I tried to write a few songs suitable for commercial gentlemen. Thus, the work of bank clerks when casting up columns might begin with a thundering chorus in praise of Simple Addition.|$|R
500|$|Nixon's {{defeat of}} Voorhis {{has been cited}} as {{the first of a}} number of red-baiting campaigns by the future {{president}} which elevated him to the House, the Senate, the Vice Presidency, and eventually put him in position to run for president. [...] Nixon, in his 1978 memoir, stated that the central issue in the 1946 campaign was [...] "the quality of life in postwar America", and he won because voters [...] "had 'had enough,' and they decided to do something about it". [...] Voorhis, in his 1947 memoir, indicated that the [...] "most important single factor in the campaign of 1946 was the difference in general attitude between the 'outs' and the 'ins'. [...] Anyone seeking to unseat an incumbent needed only to point out <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> had gone wrong and all the trouble of the war period and its aftermath." ...|$|E
500|$|Melody Maker {{columnist}} Sharon O'Connell {{said the}} album was [...] "the very best bit of fucked up rock 'n' roll [...] all year", and it was {{named one of the}} 20 best albums of the year by Spin in December 1991. Deborah Frost of The Village Voice, in her review of the album, called it [...] "genre-defying", taking note of Love's reputation on the album as [...] "the girl who won't shut up... She is <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> she should not be, and she shoves it, raw, right in your face." [...] The Seattle publication The Stranger took note of the album's production work by Gordon and Fleming, stating that [...] "despite Pretty on the Insides reputation as an unhinged, raw-sounding debut, a great deal of professional calculation went into putting this record together." [...] They also applauded Love's lyrics, and said the album [...] "judiciously toes the line between the evasively obtuse and overtly obscene".|$|E
500|$|After {{years of}} development, {{a feature film}} {{adaptation}} of The Green Hornet was handled by Rogen and Goldberg, with a theatrical release in January 2011. Rogen chose to do a re-imagining of the title character. He was {{executive producer of the}} movie and also cast himself as the main character. Rogen later admitted to having been overwhelmed by handling its $120million budget. [...] "It's insane. But it's not so much the specific amount of money that's stressful, it's <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> go along with making a movie of that size." [...] The actor also went on a strict weight-loss diet to play the slim crime fighter. The Green Hornet was a critical disappointment; Adam Graham of the Detroit News called it [...] "a big, sloppy, loud, grating mess of a movie" [...] and the Arizona Republics Bill Goodykoontz found its story to have fallen apart. Nonetheless it still opened at number one at the box office, making $33million in its opening weekend before going on to gross more than $225million.|$|E

60|$|Then {{he looked}} again and almost fell in his horror, for {{now he could}} see <b>all.</b> <b>The</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> he had taken for a stone set upon the rock-table {{was the head of}} the Dweller in the Waters, for there in it, as the light struck on them, two dreadful eyes gleamed with a dull and {{changing}} fire. Moreover, he discovered what was the object which lay under the throat of the reptile. It was the body of that priest whom Otter had taken with him in his leap from the statue, for he could see the dead face projecting on one side.|$|R
