40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the sound wave forms which correspond to auscultatory findings of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) clicking and crepitation. Such knowledge is important when selecting parts of digital recordings for spectral analysis. Electronic digital recordings were made with a sampling rate of 44 100 Hz from 60 subjects, including 51 patients referred for suspected rheumatological disease and nine healthy subjects. Accelerometers with the bandwidth 20 – 3600 Hz were used for all subjects and complementary recordings were made from a subgroup of nine subjects using a measurement microphone with the bandwidth 20 – 20 000 Hz. The clicking sounds could be classified into different types according to differences in temporal period duration (T) as measured on the <b>analogue</b> <b>display.</b> One type of clicking, found in 51 % of the patients, had a T of 2 – 20 ms. Another type, found in 70 % of the subjects, had a T of less than 1 ms, often as low 0. 2 ms. This type of clicking was not seen at all in the <b>analogue</b> <b>display</b> if the sampling rate was below 3 000 Hz. The character of the two types of clicking differed: the short duration sounds had a very high pitch, while the pitch of the longer duration sound was lower. Crepitation was found in 63 % of the subjects and was observed to be composed of a series of short duration sounds, occurring with brief (less than 10 ms) intervals. It is concluded that the accelerometer (or microphone) bandwidth should cover the entire audible range (20 – 20 000 Hz), and that sampling rates must be much higher than 3000 Hz, and preferably greater than 10 000 Hz, before the true significance of electronically recorded joint sounds/vibrations can be determined...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of radar proceeded {{in a number}} of steps, of which each had a fundamental effect on the performance. In the beginning, the radar was built using all analogue technology with an <b>analogue</b> <b>display.</b> Information extraction was performed at that time by adjusting the dynamic range of the cathode-ray display. A big improvement was obtained when the output data after analogue filtering and signal processing were sampled and digitized. This allowed some post processing of these data. A number of detection techniques with different algorithms and adaptive thresholds could be implemented. The algorithms could be changed by software if necessary. Digital displays provided a clear extraction of the relevant information. With the increasing availability of fast analogue-to-digital converters and computers, the point of digitization could then be shifted more and more towards the antenna such that programmable filters and signal processing algorithms could be applied. This allowed to apply all the flexibility of digital signal processing in the time domain...|$|E

40|$|Rap 1 is an {{important}} regulatory proteins involved in cell-cell adhesion and cell-matrix adhesion. The regulation of cell adhesion is important for cell migration. Cell migration is a vital process required for embryogenesis, wound healing and the immune response. It is also involved in certain pathological processes, including cancer cell metastasis. In this thesis, I show that when endogenous Rap 1 is activated using the Epac-specific cAMP analogue 8 -pCPT- 2 ’OMe-cAMP, epithelial cells no longer respond to migration-inducing growth factors. This inhibition is not caused by an effect of Rap 1 on E-cadherin-dependent cell-cell junctions or a direct inhibition of the growth factor signaling pathways, but is mediated by specific effects on the migration machinery. Cells treated with the cAMP <b>analogue</b> <b>display</b> an increase in focal adhesion size and number {{and a decrease in}} lamellipodial protrusion. It remains unclear via which Rap 1 effector proteins this/these effect(s) is/are mediated. Furthermore, the major signaling pathways involved in focal adhesion dynamics, are unaffected by activation of Rap 1. This lead to the hypothesis that Rap 1 may affect the linkage between the integrin and the actin cytoskeleton, to control cell migration...|$|E

For the present study, the Analogue CSIRO Tomato Firmness Meter (AFM), which measures fruit deformation under a 500 g load applied for 30 s was modified by replacing the analogue displacement gauge with a digital gauge and by using a laboratory jack for positioning the fruit in the vertical dimension. Non-destructive measurements of tomato fruit softening during ripening and determined with the Digital Firmness Meter (DFM) were strongly correlated with both firmness measured with the AFM (r(2) = 0. 96, n = 19) and with firmness determined subjectively by hand pressure (r(2) = 0. 93, n = 19). Similarly, mango fruit softening during ripening was monitored and DFM and hand firmness measurements were well correlated (r(2) = 0. 95, n = 10). The firmness of individual fruit could be measured around 20 % faster with the DFM than with the AFM, and displacement was easier to read from the digital than from the <b>analogue</b> <b>display.</b> The DFM {{proved to be a}} suitable device for measuring fruit firmness in postharvest laboratory studies and warrants evaluation under commercial packing and handling conditions...|$|E

40|$|Histone deacetylase (HDAC) {{proteins}} are {{targets for}} drug design towards {{the treatment of}} cancers since overexpression of HDAC is linked to cancer. Several HDAC inhibitors, including the FDA approved drug suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA, Vorinostat), have cleared clinical trials and emerged as anti-cancer drugs. However, SAHA inhibits all of the 11 metal ion-dependent HDAC proteins. Therefore, we synthesized several libraries of small molecule HDAC inhibitors based on SAHA to help understand the structural requirements of inhibitory potency and isoform selectivity. In previous work, SAHA analogues functionalized at the C 2 position (C 2 -SAHA analogues) near the metal binding hydroxamic acid displayed decreased inhibitory activity compared to the parent compound, SAHA. The lack of potency of the C 2 library indicated that limited flexibility exists in the HDAC active site near the hydroxamic acid. Therefore, we theorized the substituents on the C 3, C 4, C 5, C 6, and C 7 positions would display more potent inhibition compared to the C 2 -SAHA library due to the solvent exposed location. Interestingly, while the C 2 -SAHA analogues containing any substituents were poor potent, the C 3 -SAHA analogue with a methyl substituent displayed potency,. The potency of the remaining analogues decreased with increasing size of the C 3 substituents. Moreover, the C 6 -SAHA phenyl <b>analogue</b> even <b>displayed</b> potency in the submicromolar range. Finally, most of the C 7 -SAHA <b>analogues</b> <b>displayed</b> equal or greater potency compared to SAHA. The results indicate that more flexibility in the HDAC active site exists closer to the capping group region near the C 6 and C 7 position, while only modest flexibility exists {{in the bottom of}} the active site near the C 2 and C 3 position. After analyzing the potency of SAHA analogues, isoform selective inhibition of the individual compounds was evaluated. Seven of the SAHA analogues demonstrated selectivity. The C 3 -SAHA ethyl-substituted analogue showed preference for HDAC 6 over HDAC 1 and HDAC 3 even though it displayed decreased potency. The C 6 -SAHA <b>analogues</b> <b>displayed</b> diverse selectivity; the C 6 -SAHA methyl variant displayed preference for class I, t-butyl variant showed a dual-HDAC 1 and HDAC 6 selectivity, and 2 -ethylhexyl variant showed HDAC 3 -selectivity.

40|$|The {{incorporation}} of C 5 -amino-modified 2 ′-deoxyuridine analogues into DNA have found application in nucleic acid labelling, the stabilization of nucleic acid structures, functionalization of nucleic acid aptamers and catalysts, {{and the investigation}} of sequence-specific DNA bending. In this study, we describe the physicochemical properties of four different C 5 -amino-modified 2 ′-deoxyuridines in which the amino group is tethered to the base via a 3 -carbon alkyl, Z- or E-alkenyl or alkynyl linker. Conformational parameters of the nucleosides and their pKa values were deduced using 1 H NMR. All of them display the expected anti-conformation of the nucleoside with 2 ′-endo sugar puckers for the deoxyribose ring. A preference for the cisoid conformation for the Z-alkenyl analogue is found, while the E-alkenyl analogue exists exclusively as its transoid conformation. The pKa values range from 10. 0 for the analogue with an aliphatic propyl linker to 8. 5 for the propargylamino analogue. The analogues {{have been used for}} the synthesis of triple-helix forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) in which they replace thymidine in the natural sequence. Oligonucleotides containing the propargylamino <b>analogue</b> <b>display</b> the highest stability especially at low pH, while those containing analogues with propyl and especially Z-alkenyl linkers are destabilized to a great extent. TFOs containing the analogue with the E-alkenyl linker have stability similar to the unmodified structures. The chemical synthesis of TFOs containing the analogue, 5 -(3 -hydroxyprop- 1 -ynyl) - 2 ′-deoxyuridine that possesses a neutral but polar side chain show a remarkable stability, which is higher than that of all TFOs containing the alkylamino or alkenylamino analogues and only slightly lower than that of TFOs containing the propargylamino analogue. Both the hydroxyl and propargylamino substitutions impart enhanced triple-helix stability relative to the analogous sequences containing C 5 -propynyl- 2 ′-deoxyuridine. Furthermore, a similar dependence of stability on pH is found between TFOs containing the hydroxypropynyl modifications and those containing the propargylamino side chains. This suggests that the major factor responsible for stabilizing such triple helices is due to the presence of the alkyne with an attached electronegative group...|$|E
