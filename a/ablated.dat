25|$|Nd:YAG lasers {{emitting}} {{light at}} 1064nm {{have been the}} most widely used laser for laser-induced thermotherapy, in which benign or malignant lesions in various organs are <b>ablated</b> by the beam.|$|E
25|$|Vesicostomy {{followed}} by valve ablation - a stoma, or hole, {{is made in}} the urinary bladder, also known as low diversion, after which the valve is <b>ablated</b> and the stoma is closed.|$|E
25|$|High {{pressure}} {{region where}} we find a more diffusion-like expansion of the <b>ablated</b> material. Naturally this scattering is also dependent on {{the mass of the}} background gas and can influence the stoichiometry of the deposited film.|$|E
30|$|<b>Ablate</b> {{the entire}} inner {{surface of the}} cyst wall using the laser beam. Power {{settings}} of 30 – 55  W for CO 2 laser beam and 6 – 10  W for CO 2 fibre (based on animal data) are usually used. The laser {{should be on the}} <b>ablate</b> function to widen the beam (e.g. ‘defocus’ or ‘surgiscan’). The laser should be applied in such a mode that it can <b>ablate</b> the tissue while preserving the underlying healthy tissue.|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{protection}} system (TPS) typically use materials which <b>ablate</b> at high temperature for mass-efficient rejection of aerothermal heat load. A reliable numerical procedure that can compute surface recession rate, mass loss, surface heat flux, and surface temperature distribution under general heating conditions {{is essential to}} successfully carry out the design of an optimum TPS. Thus, {{in order to improve}} estimating of the heat flux over an <b>ablating</b> surface, a flow solver coupled with <b>ablating</b> surface conditions becomes a requirement. A study have been conducted to predict nozzle recession behaviour in a solid rocket motor nozzle and for broad variations of motor operating conditions...|$|R
5000|$|CO2 lasers, used to cut, vaporize, <b>ablate</b> and photo-coagulate soft tissue.|$|R
25|$|Laser {{parameters}} – {{several factors}} such as the laser fluence , laser energy, and ionization degree of the <b>ablated</b> material will affect the film quality, the stoichiometry, and the deposition flux. Generally, the nucleation density increases when the deposition flux is increased.|$|E
25|$|The lucky {{survivor}} model (cluster ionization mechanism) postulates that analyte molecules {{are incorporated}} in the matrix maintaining the charge state from solution. Ion formation occurs through charge separation upon fragmentation of laser <b>ablated</b> clusters. Ions that are not neutralized by recombination with photoelectrons or counter ions are the so-called lucky survivors.|$|E
25|$|MALDI {{methodology}} is a three-step process. First, {{the sample}} is mixed with a suitable matrix material and applied to a metal plate. Second, a pulsed laser irradiates the sample, triggering ablation and desorption of the sample and matrix material. Finally, the analyte molecules are ionized by being protonated or deprotonated in the hot plume of <b>ablated</b> gases, and can then be accelerated into whichever mass spectrometer is used to analyse them.|$|E
50|$|Exposure to {{repeated}} nuclear blasts raises {{the problem of}} ablation (erosion) of the pusher plate. Calculations and experiments indicated that a steel pusher plate would <b>ablate</b> less than 1 mm, if unprotected. If sprayed with an oil it would not <b>ablate</b> at all (this was discovered by accident; a test plate had oily fingerprints on it and the fingerprints suffered no ablation). The absorption spectra of carbon and hydrogen minimize heating. The design temperature of the shockwave, 67,000 °C, emits ultraviolet light. Most materials and elements are opaque to ultraviolet especially at the 340 MPa pressures the plate experiences. This prevents the plate from melting or <b>ablating.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A laser scalpel is {{a scalpel}} for surgery, cutting or <b>ablating</b> living {{biological}} tissue {{by the energy}} of laser light. The laser scalpel was invented in 1964. In soft tissue laser surgery, a laser beam <b>ablates</b> or vaporizes the soft tissue with high water content. Diode, Nd: and Er:YAG, and CO2 lasers are used most commonly in soft tissue surgery.|$|R
50|$|When <b>ablating</b> tissue {{near the}} AV node (a special {{conduction}} center that carries electrical impulses from the atria to the ventricles), {{there is a}} risk of producing heart block - that is, normal conduction from the atria cannot be transmitted to the ventricles. Freezing tissue near the AV node is less likely to provoke irreversible heart block than <b>ablating</b> it with heat.|$|R
25|$|The {{third stage}} is {{important}} to determine {{the quality of the}} deposited films. The high energetic species <b>ablated</b> from the target are bombarding the substrate surface and may cause damage to the surface by sputtering off atoms from the surface but also by causing defect formation in the deposited film. The sputtered species from the substrate and the particles emitted from the target form a collision region, which serves as a source for condensation of particles. When the condensation rate is high enough, a thermal equilibrium can be reached and the film grows on the substrate surface {{at the expense of the}} direct flow of ablation particles and the thermal equilibrium obtained.|$|E
25|$|In Central and South American {{electric}} ants, Wasmannia auropunctata, queens {{produce more}} queens through automictic parthenogenesis with central fusion. Sterile workers usually are produced from eggs fertilized by males. In {{some of the}} eggs fertilized by males, however, the fertilization can cause the female genetic material to be <b>ablated</b> from the zygote. In this way, males pass on only their genes to become fertile male offspring. This is the first recognized example of an animal species where both females and males can reproduce clonally resulting in a complete separation {{of male and female}} gene pools. As a consequence, the males will only have fathers and the queens only mothers, while the sterile workers are the only ones with both parents of both genders.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemotherapy}} or irradiation given immediately {{prior to}} a transplant is called the conditioning regimen, the purpose {{of which is to}} help eradicate the patient's disease prior to the infusion of HSC and to suppress immune reactions. The bone marrow can be <b>ablated</b> (destroyed) with dose-levels that cause minimal injury to other tissues. In allogeneic transplants a combination of cyclophosphamide with total body irradiation is conventionally employed. This treatment also has an immunosuppressive effect that prevents rejection of the HSC by the recipient's immune system. The post-transplant prognosis often includes acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease that may be life-threatening. However, in certain leukemias this can coincide with protection against cancer relapse owing to the graft-versus-tumor effect. Autologous transplants may also use similar conditioning regimens, but many other chemotherapy combinations can be used {{depending on the type of}} disease.|$|E

50|$|Both wavelengths, GreenLight and Holmium, <b>ablate</b> {{approximately}} {{one to two}} grams of tissue per minute.|$|R

25|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} guided focused ultrasound, is a non-invasive intervention (requiring no incision) {{that uses}} high intensity focused ultrasound waves to destroy tissue {{in combination with}} magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which guides and monitors the treatment. During the procedure, delivery of focused ultrasound energy is guided and controlled using MR thermal imaging. Patients who have symptomatic fibroids, who desire a non-invasive treatment option and {{who do not have}} contraindications for MRI are candidates for MRgFUS. About 60% of patients qualify. It is an outpatient procedure and takes one to three hours {{depending on the size of}} the fibroids. It is safe and about 75% effective. Symptomatic improvement is sustained for two plus years. Need for additional treatment varies from 16-20% and is largely dependent on the amount of fibroid that can be safely ablated; the higher the <b>ablated</b> volume, the lower the re-treatment rate. There are currently no randomized trial between MRgFUS and UAE. A multi-center trial is underway to investigate the efficacy of MRgFUS vs. UAE.|$|E

2500|$|The laser {{is fired}} at the matrix {{crystals}} in the dried-droplet spot. The matrix absorbs the laser energy and {{it is thought that}} primarily the matrix is desorbed and ionized (by addition of a proton) by this event. The hot plume produced during ablation contains many species: neutral and ionized matrix molecules, protonated and deprotonated matrix molecules, matrix clusters and nanodroplets. <b>Ablated</b> species may participate in the ionization of analyte, though the mechanism of MALDI is still debated. The matrix is then thought to transfer protons to the analyte molecules (e.g., protein molecules), thus charging the analyte. An ion observed after this process will consist of the initial neutral molecule [...] with ions added or removed. This is called a quasimolecular ion, for example + {{in the case of an}} added proton, + in the case of an added sodium ion, or − in the case of a removed proton. MALDI is capable of creating singly charged ions or multiply charged ions (n+) depending on the nature of the matrix, the laser intensity, and/or the voltage used. Note that these are all even-electron species. Ion signals of radical cations (photoionized molecules) can be observed, e.g., in the case of matrix molecules and other organic molecules.|$|E

50|$|There is {{a system}} in {{clinical}} trials using a transurethral probe to <b>ablate</b> the prostate tissue from the inside-out.|$|R
2500|$|Linear accelerators emit {{high energy}} X-rays; {{the process is}} usually {{referred}} to as [...] "X-ray therapy" [...] or [...] "photon therapy." [...] The term [...] "gamma ray" [...] is usually reserved for photons that are emitted from a radioisotope such as cobalt-60 (see below). Such radiation is not substantially different from that emitted by high voltage accelerators. In linear accelerator therapy, the emission head (called [...] "gantry") is mechanically rotated around the patient, in a full or partial circle. The table where the patient is lying, the [...] "couch", can also be moved in small linear or angular steps. The combination of {{the movements of the}} gantry and of the couch makes possible the computerized planning of the volume of tissue {{that is going to be}} irradiated. Devices with a high energy of 6MeV are the most suitable for the treatment of the brain, due to the depth of the target. The diameter of the energy beam leaving the emission head can be adjusted to the size of the lesion by means of collimators. They may be interchangeable orifices with different diameters, typically varying from 5 to 40mm in 5mm steps, or multileaf collimators, which consist of a number of metal leaflets that can be moved dynamically during treatment in order to shape the radiation beam to conform to the mass to be <b>ablated.</b> [...] Linacs are capable of achieving extremely narrow beam geometries, such as 0.15 to 0.3mm. Therefore, they can be used for several kinds of surgeries which hitherto had been carried out by open or endoscopic surgery, such as for trigeminal neuralgia, etc. The exact mechanism of its effectiveness for trigeminal neuralgia is not known; however, its use for this purpose has become very common. Long-term follow-up data has shown it to be as effective as radiofrequency ablation, but inferior to surgery in preventing the recurrence of pain.|$|E
2500|$|The {{space between}} the uranium fusion tamper (also termed pusher; both terms can be used interchangeably) which is the metal {{cladding}} encasing the secondary and the case formed a radiation channel to conduct X-rays from the primary to the secondary assembly; the interstage. It {{is one of the}} most closely guarded secrets of a multi-stage thermonuclear weapon. Implosion of the secondary assembly is indirectly driven, and the techniques used in the interstage to smooth the spatial profile (i.e. reduce coherence and nonuniformities) of the primary’s irradiance are of utmost importance. This was done with the introduction of the channel filler – an optical element used as a refractive medium, also called random-phase plate. This [...] "plate" [...] was a polystyrene plastic foam filling, extruded or impregnated with a low-molecular-weight hydrocarbon (possibly methane gas), which turned to a low-Z plasma from the X-rays and tamped (not to be confused with the fusion tamper) the sputtering effect that choked the radiation from compressing the secondary. Sputtering is the manifestation of the underdense plasma corona of the ablating hohlraum and the tamper surfaces. It is a problem, also shared by magnetically confined fusion reactors (see Tokamak), that has to do with the <b>ablated</b> particles, the blown-off uranium (or Pb–Bi alloy, depending on the [...] "cocktail", or high-Z element mixture, of the hohlraum design to tailor its opacity), which fly inside the radiation channel and absorb radiation or reflect it, contributing negatively to the radiation mirroring (also termed [...] "ducting" [...] in the TN jargon). The re-emitted X-rays from the radiation case must be deposited uniformly on the outer walls of the secondary’s tamper and ablate it externally, driving the thermonuclear fuel capsule (increasing the density and temperature of the fusion fuel) to the point needed to sustain a thermonuclear reaction. (see Nuclear weapon design). This point is above the threshold where the fusion fuel would turn opaque to its emitting radiation, as determined from its Rosseland opacity. After all, for any hydrogen weapon system to work, this radiative equilibrium must be reached together with the compression equilibrium between the fusion tamper and the sparkplug (see below), hence their name equilibrium supers.|$|E
50|$|Although {{hatcheries}} in {{the developing}} countries still depend on wild seed, maturation can be induced by eyestalk ablation technique where eyestalks of females are unilaterally <b>ablated</b> to stimulate endocrine activity. The <b>ablated</b> females spawn after 4 days, with a peak observed at days 5-6. However it is expensive to raise spawners in captivity and <b>ablated</b> shrimps result in less hardy fry with low survival rate. Even though the fecundity of the <b>ablated</b> females may not differ significantly, the hatch rates of <b>ablated</b> females {{was found to be}} markedly less (37.8% to 58.1%) than that of unablated females (69.2%). It is also found that wild females are more fecund per unit weight than <b>ablated</b> females. However quantitatively the number of spawns, eggs and nauplii produced by <b>ablated</b> females is ten, eight and six times respectively that of unablated females.|$|E
5000|$|Microwave ablation: Using a small probe {{introduced}} into the uterus, a provider uses microwave energy to <b>ablate</b> the endometrium.|$|R
30|$|Throughout this study, the {{investigator}} {{was asked to}} treat fibroids {{in a manner consistent}} with his expected “real world” clinical use. That is, to <b>ablate</b> those fibroids having a reasonable probability of being symptomatic, while ensuring subject safety and attempting to <b>ablate</b> at least 50 % of each fibroid's volume. In doing so, {{the investigator}} determined the best ablation size and location for each individual fibroid, and whether one or more ablations should be performed.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{treatment}} options are available. They all work by destroying (<b>ablating)</b> the endometrium, {{the lining of}} the uterine cavity.|$|R
50|$|Part of the Bowman's {{membrane}} is <b>ablated</b> by the {{photorefractive keratectomy}} refractive surgery (commonly known as PRK). As the layer is non-generative, {{the section of}} the membrane <b>ablated</b> in the procedure is lost forever.|$|E
50|$|Another {{example is}} the trochophore larva of Platynereis dumerilii, where the larval eye was <b>ablated</b> and the larvae was not phototactic, anymore. However phototaxis in the nectochaete larva of Platynereis dumerilii is not {{mediated}} by the larval eyes, because the larva is still phototactic, even if the larval eyes are <b>ablated.</b> But if the adult eyes are <b>ablated,</b> then the nectochaete is not phototactic anymore and thus phototaxis in the nectochaete larva is mediated by the adult eyes.|$|E

40|$|The {{simplest}} regeneration experiments {{involve the}} ablation {{of a single}} cell type. While methods exist to <b>ablate</b> the melanocytes of the larval zebrafish, 1, 2 no convenient method exists to <b>ablate</b> melanocytes in adult zebrafish. Here, we show that the copper chelator neocuproine (NCP) causes fragmentation and disappearance of melanin in adult zebrafish melanocytes. Adult melanocytes expressing eGFP {{under the control of}} a melanocyte-specific promoter also lose eGFP fluorescence in the presence of NCP. We conclude that NCP causes melanocyte death. This death is independent of p 53 and melanin, but can be suppressed by the addition of exogenous copper. NCP is ineffective at <b>ablating</b> larval melanocytes. This now provides a tool for addressing questions about stem cells and the maintenance of the adult pigment pattern in zebrafish...|$|R
