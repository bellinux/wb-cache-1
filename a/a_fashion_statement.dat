Women's swimwear is often <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> <b>statement,</b> and whether it is modest or not is a subject of debate by many groups, religious and secular.|$|E
25|$|Some men shave their heads, {{either as}} <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> <b>statement,</b> because {{they find a}} shaved head {{preferable}} to the appearance of male pattern baldness, or in order to attain enhanced cooling of the skull – particularly for people suffering from hyperhidrosis. A much smaller number of Western women also shave their heads, often as a fashion or political statement.|$|E
25|$|After her marriage, Dolores {{adopted the}} severe {{masculine}} style of dress and hair popular at that time, appearing in Eve, The Lady's Pictorial in 1925 {{in a suit}} jacket and tie. The mannish appearance, uncharacteristic (in photographs) half-smile, and the knowing look in the picture has caused later commentators to wonder whether Dolores was signalling {{that she was a}} lesbian, but {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that she was and her appearance at this time may simply have been <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> <b>statement.</b> The photograph appeared, slightly changed, on the cover of Fashioning Sapphism: The Origins of a Modern English Lesbian Culture by Laura Doan in 2013.|$|E

2500|$|When reggae music gained {{popularity}} and mainstream acceptance in the 1970s thanks to Bob Marley's music and cultural influence, the locks (often called [...] "dreads") became <b>a</b> notable <b>fashion</b> <b>statement</b> worldwide; {{they have been}} worn by prominent authors, actors, athletes and rappers, and were even portrayed as part of gang culture in such movies as Marked for Death.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{people of}} various ethnicities {{throughout}} the world have naturally voluminous hair. For these people, [...] "big hair" [...] is not <b>a</b> deliberate <b>fashion</b> <b>statement</b> requiring any particular technique to achieve, but rather the default state of their hair. Some 60 percent of the world's population has naturally curly hair, which {{tends to be more}} voluminous than straight hair.|$|R
25|$|Things {{started to}} change when during the European renaissance, the high heel became a status symbol worn by both male and females from the higher social statuses. Catherine de' Medici, a Franco/Italian noblewoman, pioneered the use of heels as <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> <b>statement.</b> Catherine de Medici is {{believed}} to have worn them to impress the French court when she wed the Duke of Orleans, the future king. It {{is believed to be the}} first instance when heels were worn however, this reference may be apocryphal, as the development of heels did not begin to come about until the late 1580s, based on iconographic evidence and extant pieces. Two hundred years later King Louis XIV of France decreed that only nobility could wear heels, and that only members of his specific court could wear red ones. Seventeenth-century portraits of King Louis XIV depict the various intricate heels worn by the king and they were often decorated with miniature battle scenes.|$|E
500|$|The fine clothes {{donated by}} the King, which Dover wore when he presided over the Games, were not just <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> <b>statement,</b> but also a {{political}} one. The feather in Dover's hat was a [...] "flag of defiance to virtue" [...] in Puritan eyes, and even the starch probably used in the washing of his ruff was evil, according to the Puritan writer Philip Stubbes. He described starch as [...] " [...] certain kind of liquid matter... wherein the Devil hath learned them [...] to wash and die their ruffs".|$|E
500|$|Nipple {{piercing}} {{may have}} been a sign of masculinity for the soldiers of Rome. Nipple piercing has also been connected to rites of passage for both British and American sailors who had traveled beyond a significant latitude and longitude. Western women of the 14th century sometimes sported pierced as well as rouged nipples left visible by the low-cut dresses fashionable in the day. It is widely reported that in the 1890s, nipple rings called [...] "bosom rings" [...] resurfaced as <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> <b>statement</b> among women of the West, who would wear them on one or both sides, but if such a trend existed, it was short-lived.|$|E

50|$|A {{roadster}} bicycle, {{is a type}} {{of utility}} bicycle once common worldwide, and still common in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and some parts of Europe.

500|$|Evangelical pastor Rick Warren {{delivered}} the invocation for the inaugural ceremony, {{followed by a}} performance by vocalist Aretha Franklin, who sang [...] "My Country, 'Tis of Thee". The program featured a performance of John Williams' composition [...] "Air and Simple Gifts", which was both pre-recorded and performed live synched with the recording by cellist Yo-YoMa, violinist Itzhak Perlman, pianist Gabriela Montero and clarinetist Anthony McGill. National Public Radio described the performance by the quartet as [...] "atransporting moment that moved many with its beauty and calm", while The New York Times called it the [...] "classical-music equivalent of lip-syncing". Aretha Franklin made <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> <b>statement</b> by wearing a hat with a distinctive Swarovski crystal-studded bow.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Arthur Pierson, and was produced by Glenn Goodwin, while Wayne Isham {{was in charge of}} photography. At the time of the song's release, Madonna's style of dress was catching on as <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> <b>statement</b> among club kids and her fans. The most prominent among her fashion accessories were the crucifixes she wore as earrings and necklaces. Madonna commented that wearing a rosary and a crucifix is [...] "kind of offbeat and interesting. I mean, everything I do is sort of tongue-in-cheeks. Besides, the crucifixes seem to go with my name." [...] In reality, she was trying to find a separate image for herself, being inspired by then artists like Boy George, Cyndi Lauper and David Bowie, and their constantly shifting image and persona. Madonna realized the importance of her music videos and its popularity via MTV—launched in 1981—was instrumental in popularizing her image.|$|E
500|$|Robert Brunner, Apple's head of {{industrial}} design at the time, led the design team that developed the laptop, including its trackball and granite color. Brunner said he designed the PowerBook [...] "so {{it would be}} as easy to use and carry as a regular book". The dark granite grey color set it apart from other notebook computers of the time and also from Apple's other products, which traditionally were beige or platinum grey. The trackball, another new design element, was placed {{in the middle of the}} computer, allowing the PowerBook to be easily operated by both left- and right-handed users. The designers were trying to create <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> <b>statement</b> with the overall design of the laptop, which they felt made it a more personal accessory, like a wallet or briefcase. Brunner said: [...] "It says something about the identity of the person who is carrying it".|$|E
50|$|Another type of {{wristband}} is the sweatband; {{usually made}} of a towel-like terrycloth material. These are usually used to wipe sweat from the forehead during sport but {{have been known to}} be used as <b>a</b> badge or <b>fashion</b> <b>statement.</b> <b>A</b> practice common in mid-1980s punk subculture was to cut the top off of <b>a</b> sock and <b>fashion</b> the elastic into this type of wristband.|$|R
50|$|The bum or butt flap is a {{piece of}} {{removable}} material that hangs from the waist to cover the rear end. The flap is of ambiguous origin, but probably was originally intended to reduce abrasive wear to pants. Pavement can rapidly wear the seat of pants, and flaps act as replaceable buffer material. They also provide some protection from damp or cold surfaces. The freely swinging flap dries faster than wet pants, and can be easier to clean. Bum flaps are often worn as <b>a</b> superfluous <b>fashion</b> <b>statement,</b> usually emblazoned with punk iconography.|$|R
50|$|Fashion rapidly {{changed in}} the 1960s, {{and by the time}} of the Investiture of The Prince of Wales in 1969, Hartnell's clothes for the Queen and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother were short, simple designs, {{reflecting}} their own personal style. His royal clothes created an impeccably neat look that managed to be stylish without making <b>an</b> overt <b>fashion</b> <b>statement.</b> This ability exemplified his genius and was practised to perfection, as he became increasingly pre-occupied with royal orders. In this he was helped by Ian Thomas, who left to found his own establishment in 1966, and the Japanese designer Yuki (Gnyuki Tormimaru), who similarly left to create his own highly successful business.|$|R
500|$|The {{album was}} re-released in 1985 for the European market and re-packaged as Madonna: The First Album with a {{different}} artwork created by photographer George Holy. The cover features Madonna in similar style of dress to the original cover but this time with crucifix as her earrings. Madonna's trademark style was catching on as <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> <b>statement</b> among club kids and fans, with her crucifix accessories becoming the jewelry of the moment. Madonna said that wearing a crucifix is [...] "kind of offbeat and interesting. I mean, everything I do is sort of tongue-in-cheeks. Besides, the crucifixes seem to go with my name." [...] In 2001, Warner Bros. Records released a remastered version of the album with its original artwork and two bonus remix tracks of [...] "Burning Up" [...] and [...] "Lucky Star". Madonna dedicated the album to her father, Tony Ciccone, with whom her relationship had not been good until {{the release of the}} album. In an interview with Time magazine, Madonna said: [...] "My father had never believed that what I was doing here [...] was worthwhile, nor did he believe that I was up to any good. [...] It wasn't until my first album came out and my father started hearing my songs on the radio that he stopped asking the questions." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1970s, {{like other}} garment makers, bra {{manufacturers}} moved production offshore. The {{evolution of the}} bra reflects the constantly changing idea of what an [...] "ideal" [...] woman should look likeflat, round, pointy, conical, or even [...] "natural". The contemporary bra also reflects advances in manufacturing and availability of fabric types and colours, enabling it to be transformed from a utilitarian item to <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> <b>statement,</b> countering the negative attitudes some women had about bras. Designers have also incorporated numerous devices to produce varying shapes, cleavage, and to give women bras they could wear with open-back dresses, off-the-shoulder dresses, plunging necklines, and the like.|$|E
2500|$|The Gibson Girl {{was one of}} {{the origins}} of the flapper. The {{invention}} of Charles Dana Gibson, the Gibson Girl changed the fashion, patterns, and lifestyles of the 1920s; these were much more progressive than the traditions of women’s styles in the past. Before the Gibson Girl movement, women's voices as a group were infrequently heard. [...] While some may see the Gibson Girl as just <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> <b>statement,</b> it was much more broadly influential than that. [...] "She depicted the modern woman, known popularly as the 'new woman', at a time when more women gained independence, began to work outside the home, and sought the right to vote and other rights." [...] Gibson's illustrations showed feminist women of all kinds who worried more about themselves than about pleasing the men in their lives. [...] It was the first time a woman could actually concentrate on her own dreams and goals. The Gibson Girl also exemplified the importance of intelligence and learning rather than catering to men's needs.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, in {{countries}} such as the United States and South Africa, the term [...] "boy" [...] was used as a pejorative racist insult towards men of color and slaves, indicating their subservient social status of being less than men. In response, Am I Not A Man And A Brother? became a catchphrase used by British and American abolitionists. In 1787, Josiah Wedgwood designed a medallion for the British anti-slavery campaign. He copied the original design from the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade as a cameo in black-and-white. It was widely reproduced and became <b>a</b> popular <b>fashion</b> <b>statement</b> promoting justice, humanity, and freedom.|$|R
5000|$|The {{template}} for rimless eyeglasses {{date back to}} the 1820s, when an Austrian inventor named [...] marketed a rimless monocle. The design as it is known today arose in the 1880s as a means to alleviate the combined weight of metal frames with heavy glass lenses. The style also came about from a desire to make eyewear as inconspicuous as possible; at the time, eyeglasses were not considered <b>an</b> acceptable <b>fashion</b> <b>statement</b> and carried connotations of one being elderly or a member of the clergy; historically, most eyeglass wearers needed them to correct presbyopia, and only clergymen tended to be literate enough to require reading glasses.|$|R
5000|$|The {{history of}} {{clothing}} in India {{dates back to}} ancient times, yet <b>fashion</b> is <b>a</b> new industry, {{as it was the}} traditional Indian clothing with regional variations, be it the sari, ghagra choli or dhoti, that remained popular until the early decades of post-independence India. A common form of Indian fashion originates from Western culture. <b>Fashion</b> includes <b>a</b> series of sequins and gold thread to attract customers and apply a statement to the Indian <b>fashion</b> community. <b>A</b> famous Indian <b>fashion</b> trademark is embroidery, an art of sewing distinct thread patterns. A way to include the traditional look and create <b>a</b> new <b>fashion</b> <b>statement</b> includes embroidery applied to different dresses, skirts, shirts, and pants to reflect the western culture influence as well as include the Indian tradition.|$|R
2500|$|Hale began {{painting}} her self-portrait in 1884, {{working on}} it at her family's home in Roxbury, Massachusetts and at their summer home in Matunuck, Rhode Island. The painting, Self-Portrait, depicts Hale gazing confidently at the viewer with her right hand dangling slightly over the chair. Dressed in all black, Hale wears a dress with buttons and a fur collar, covered by a loose jacket. Peeking out of a round black hat are Hale's bangs, {{which at the time}} were praised as a youthful hairstyle but could also connote promiscuity. Hale seems to be making <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> <b>statement</b> with her bangs, choice of costume, and the ostrich-feather fan that she holds. When Hale first showed the painting to her instructors in 1885, artist Bouguereau significantly criticized the size and position of the hand and encouraged Hale to make it [...] "prettier". However, Hale did not make any of the suggested changes to the hand, refusing to conform her work to the idealized, academic notions of beauty. The compositional weight of her hand is also notable because it was extremely rare for artists of any gender to portray themselves looking directly at the viewer without any tools to identify their profession.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the 1980s, {{the punk}} style was popular among people aged 18–22. Characterized by multi-colored mohawks, ripped skinny jeans, worn band tee-shirts, and denim or leather jackets. This style was popular {{among people who}} listened to punk music such as The Sex Pistols, and later, (despite the band's self-proclaimed rock'n'roll image) Guns N' Roses. Usually the denim jackets (which became an {{identity}} of the group) were adorned by safety pins, buttons, patches, and several other pieces of music or cultural memorabilia. Oftentimes, fans of the punk style would take random bits of fabric and attach them to their other clothes with safety pins. This soon became a popular way of attaching clothing, {{and it is now}} known as [...] "pin shirts" [...] with young women. The shirts are, essentially, rectangular pieces of fabric that are pinned on one side with safety pins. In the 1980s, a dressed down look (e.g. buzzed hair, T-shirts, jeans and button up shirts) was also very popular with people involved in punk rock, more specifically the hardcore punk scene. The Circle Jerks frontman Keith Morris said [...] "Some of those punk rock kids they interviewed were a little over the top, but the thing historically is – the L.A./Hollywood punk scene was basically based on English fashion. But we {{had nothing to do with}} that. Black flag and the Circle Jerks were so far from that. We looked like the kid who worked at the gas station or submarine shop." [...] Punk dress was not simply <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> <b>statement.</b> It epitomized a way of thinking and seeing oneself as an individual cultural producer and consumer. In this way, punk style led many people to ask further questions about their culture and their politics.|$|E

5000|$|Subaru marketed the Baja in the United States, Canada, and Chile. In the United States and Canada, Subaru {{nicknamed the}} Baja as a [...] "multiple-choice vehicle" [...] {{as a result}} of its unique design and versatility. But limited advertising, late arrival of the {{turbo-charged}} model, heavily styled lower-body plastic cladding and a yellow-and-silver introductory color scheme discouraged broad appeal. James Healey, writing for USAtoday at the time of the Baja's introduction called it <b>a</b> [...] "controversial <b>fashion</b> <b>statement</b> with limited utility".|$|R
5000|$|While pop singers such as Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera popularized {{the crop}} top for teeny boppers in the 1990s and early 2000s, others were making <b>a</b> crop top <b>fashion</b> <b>statement</b> for {{pregnant}} women. Certain {{members of the}} all-female musical groups All Saints and the Spice Girls wore crop tops on stage during their pregnancies. Since 2000, cropped jackets and blazers have become more popular while the hemlines of shirts have mostly remained longer. In the 2010s, the crop top experienced a revival due to the popularity of 1990s nostalgia fashion.|$|R
5000|$|Cycle Chic is {{a modern}} phrase to {{describe}} something that has existed since {{the invention of the}} bicycle in the 1880s - regular citizens on bicycles. Cycling was fashionable from the late 1880s and through the 1940s. At the end of the 19th century, the height of cycle chic was to play polo on bicycles, using long-handled tennis rackets and rubber balls. Women's wear (such as corsets and petticoats) was impractical for cycling and so rational dress was required. [...] Divided skirts, bloomers and knickerbockers were tried as fashionable women attempted to resolve the matter without provoking hostility, ridicule or violence. More recently, in the 1980s bicycle messengers became a common sight on the streets of major cities, and the messengers' mix of street fashion and cycling gear was seen as <b>an</b> alternative <b>fashion</b> <b>statement.</b>|$|R

50|$|Ear {{piercing}} {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} forms of body modification.

40|$|Current {{approaches}} to the appraisal and investigation of personality can be classified into subjective, objective, and projective methods. These three ap-proaches can be distinguished for purposes of exposition, even though Rapaport (14) and Wechsler (18) have stressed the "projective hypothesis " in dealing with material obtained by measures which are classed usually as psychometric.
