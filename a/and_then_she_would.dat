500|$|Having {{started his}} career as a remixer, Pettibone built the basic music of the Erotica songs in the style of his remixes for which Madonna wrote the melodies and lyrics. According to Pettibone in an article [...] "Erotica Diaries" [...] {{published}} on Madonna's Icon magazine, he began with a tape of three tracks for Madonna to listen to, before he traveled to Chicago, where she was filming A League of Their Own. She listened to the songs and liked all of them. After filming was complete, Madonna met Pettibone in New York City to start working on demos in his apartment in October 1991. Their schedule was sporadic in the beginning. Madonna and Pettibone were in the studio for a week <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> work with Steven Meisel on Sex, for two weeks. Occasionally, Madonna also would meet André Betts. At first, Madonna did not like the first group of songs she had recorded. She wanted Erotica to have a raw edge to it, as if it were recorded in an alley in Harlem, and not a light glossy production to permeate her sound, according to Pettibone. [...] "Deeper and Deeper" [...] was not working for Madonna. Pettibone said they tried different bridges and changes, but in the end, Madonna wanted the middle of the song to have a flamenco guitar.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{characters}} had catchphrases {{that were}} almost as famous as Claghorn's, such as Titus Moody's [...] "Howdy, Bub", and Falstaff Openshaw's [...] "That {{is precisely why}} I am here." [...] Mrs. Nussbaum always greeted Allen by saying, [...] "You were expecting maybe...", <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> mispronounce {{the name of a}} glamorous film star, such as [...] "...Tulalulalula Bankhead?". The Alley sketches made only one further cast change, when Peter Donald's chipper Irishman Ajax Cassidy succeeded Reed's Falstaff.|$|E
2500|$|According to Pettibone in {{an article}} [...] "Erotica Diaries" [...] {{published}} on Madonna's Icon magazine, he produced a tape with four songs, for Madonna to listen to, before he traveled to Chicago, where she was filming A League of Their Own. She listened to the songs and liked all of them. After filming was complete, Madonna met Pettibone in New York City to start working together in November 1991. Their schedule was sporadic in the beginning. They were in the studio for a week <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> work with Steven Meisel on Sex, for two weeks. Occasionally, Madonna also would meet André Betts. [...] The first batch of songs Madonna and Pettibone worked on were [...] "Erotica", [...] "Deeper and Deeper", [...] "Rain" [...] and [...] "Thief of Hearts"; she would write the lyrics as Pettibone worked on the music. Pettibone recalled that the singer preferred {{to be in control}} of the writing process because [...] "her songs are her stories. They're the things she wants to say". While they were mixing a song called [...] "Erotic", which was released as promotional single on her Sex book, Pettibone recalled: ...|$|E

60|$|She wasn't {{quite so}} dazzlingly {{beautiful}} {{as they are}} on the stage, but we passed that. She showed us up into the drawing-room, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> said <b>she</b> <b>would</b> go <b>and</b> tell her mistress we were there.|$|R
50|$|Kozachenko served one two-year term {{before leaving}} politics. She {{continued}} to work as an activist in Brooklyn <b>and</b> <b>then</b> Pittsburg. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> later meet her long-time partner, MaryAnn Geiger (who died in 2010), and have one son.|$|R
60|$|It was {{at least}} an hour afterwards, and Mrs. Archibald was comfortably seated in the shade darning stockings, with an open book in her lap. Sometimes she would read a little in the book <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> make some long and careful {{stitches}} in the stocking, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> look about her as if she greatly enjoyed combining her work and her recreation in such a lovely place on such a lovely summer morning. During one of these periods of observation she perceived Corona Raybold approaching.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You are very, very stupid, my dear child,' {{his mother}} would {{sometimes}} say to him, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> add with a laugh, 'Certainly you will never catch a wolf by the tail.' ...|$|E
60|$|Susan--or Nan Shelley--sat {{for a time}} in thought. Once in a {{while she}} would cast a furtive glance around the room and its wall covered with trophies, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> turn to Sarah Judd's placid face.|$|E
60|$|So he did her bidding {{and went}} out with the other woman. Tommy was glad it was press-night. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> {{not be able to}} think for hours to come, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> perhaps, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be feeling too tired. Work can be very kind.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not certain, however," [...] {{continued}} Mary Anna, [...] "that {{you will}} go to Boston this summer. Mother said that perhaps you would not go until the fall, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> perhaps <b>she</b> <b>would</b> go with you, and bring you back to stay here through the winter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now that's {{just what}} I don't want! I don't want to stalk {{in and say}} here's the hero of romance that has saved your brother! I want to get her home, and show her that I can be civil without being satirical, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> perhaps, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> forgive me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oughtn't that {{to go for}} something? <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have {{everything}} that she wishes. She might live anywhere she pleased,--so that I might go to the office every day. She would have her own carriage, you know." ...|$|E
60|$|Dorothy {{seemed very}} much pleased, and promised the boys that, {{the next time}} she baked pies, she would kindle the fire in the oven with their {{kindling}} wood, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> bake them each a little apple turnover.|$|E
60|$|Therefore, now {{she took}} her father's arm once more: she turned resolutely to go. One more curt nod of the head, one last look of undying enmity, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> pass finally {{out of his life}} for ever.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>would</b> blame, argue, say dreadful words,--dreadful, because true <b>and</b> deserved. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> grow angry, {{as women}} {{do when they}} are most in the right, and say too much,--dreadful words, which would be untrue <b>and</b> undeserved. <b>Then</b> he should resist, recriminate. He would not stand it. He could not stand it. No. He could never face her again.|$|R
50|$|While {{still in}} illegal confinement, Ashu {{was taken to}} his house and beaten mercilessly in front of Ruchika by Rathore. Rathore then {{threatened}} her, saying {{that if she did}} not take back the complaint, her father, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> herself, <b>would</b> face the same fate. Ashu was paraded in handcuffs in his neighbourhood.|$|R
60|$|She {{sat on a}} low stool by the fire, {{near her}} father-in-law. Her head was dropped, she seemed {{in a state of}} abstraction. From time to time <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{suddenly}} recover, and look up at us, laughing <b>and</b> chatting. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> forget again. Yet in her hulked black forgetting she seemed very near to us.|$|R
60|$|Suppose {{he were to}} {{communicate}} to Farfrae {{the fact that his}} betrothed was not the child of Michael Henchard at all--legally, nobody's child; how would that correct and leading townsman receive the information? He might possibly forsake Elizabeth-Jane, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be her step-sire's own again.|$|E
60|$|I {{wrote to}} Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, {{to say what}} I had done: fully {{explaining}} also why I had thus acted. Diana and Mary approved the step unreservedly. Diana announced that she would just give me time {{to get over the}} honeymoon, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> come and see me.|$|E
60|$|Yet {{all these}} consolations could not prevent poor Marian from being very miserable, under the dread that Caroline thought her unkind, and felt herself deserted, after being {{involved}} in all this suffering. And O, should she fail! Walter must go on Saturday, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be left to fight her battle alone.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>then</b> as if <b>she</b> <b>would</b> seize {{him before}} he could go on to further repudiations, she sought hastily among the {{drawings}} again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nine summers had she {{scarcely}} seen, [...] The {{pride of}} all the vale; [...] <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> sang [4];--she <b>would</b> have been [...] 35 [...] A very nightingale.|$|R
6000|$|... "If you please," [...] {{said the}} girl, quietly. Evidently this {{explained}} why Madam Borne had discharged her so heartlessly. The gentleman from Isham, Marvin & Co. had doubtless interviewed the Madam {{and told her}} what to do. <b>And</b> <b>then,</b> knowing <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be at liberty, he had sent her this private instructor.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sure I won't do that. In {{the first}} place you'd go to sleep, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be offended; and I don't know that your sufferings would make mine any lighter. I'm not {{prepared}} to alter {{the ways of the}} world, but I feel myself entitled to grumble at them sometimes." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{were times}} when {{she seemed to be}} casting about in her mind for {{something}} to do that would please him, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> bring pieces of paper to him, and pen and ink, and tell him to write. She thought this very clever of her, and expected to be praised for it.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{could not}} bear to be quite outcast; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{sometimes}} get a notion into her head, on a cold, wet day, that the schoolroom was no cheerful place, and feel it incumbent on her to go and see if you and Henry kept up a good fire; and once there, she liked to stay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You've spoilt me, you see, mother, {{for ever}} caring for another woman. I would compare her to you, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> where <b>would</b> <b>she</b> be?" ...|$|R
60|$|Mary <b>then</b> said <b>she</b> {{was tired}} of experimenting, and so she should not come down again. She, however, asked Rollo to set the {{pendulum}} swinging, <b>and</b> that <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> draw the thread in, {{and he could see}} that it would go faster and faster, the farther she drew it up, for that would make the string grow shorter and shorter.|$|R
6000|$|... "And that is {{not very}} likely to be, Sir Thomas. Who should invite her? Maria might be very glad to see her at Sotherton now <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> but <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not think of asking her to live there; and I am sure she is better off here; and besides, I cannot do without her." ...|$|R
60|$|Very likely {{his father}} would not have cared so much; {{sometimes}} he would ask Pony's mother why she did not turn the boy barefoot with the other boys, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> ask Pony's father if he wanted the child to take his death of cold; and that would hush him up, for Pony once had a little brother that died.|$|E
6000|$|Dan {{declared}} {{it was all}} the cunning of them, for fear Judith should become chargeable to the parish, and there! her fine friends would die, or give her up, or she would just be thrown on the parish, and passed on to a strange workhouse, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> see what she got by leaving her kin. It was just like their sly tricks! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{any rate}} he is honest," [...] she would observe to herself, after some outspoken {{admission}} of unprincipled conduct on his part, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> ruefully recall certain episodes {{in which he}} had figured, from which honesty had been conspicuously absent. What she tried to label honesty in his candour was probably only a cynical defiance of the laws of right and wrong.|$|E
60|$|Bella {{looked over}} very attentively, {{while her mother}} was {{explaining}} these things to Mary Bell, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> said that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> rather draw a house than make letters.|$|R
60|$|Stephen saw, {{and horror}} held {{him in a}} tremor. His one thought was of escape. What if she should raise her eyes, and amid those vulgar stares discern his own? And yet that was within him which told him that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> look up. It was only a {{question}} of moments, <b>and</b> then,--and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> in truth despise him! Wedged tightly between the people, to move was to be betrayed. He groaned.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, papa,' insisted Mary, 'nobody {{wanted her}} to insist on taking the {{harmonium}} at Bankside last Sunday, just because Averil had a cold in her head; and she played so fast, that every one was put out, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> said <b>she</b> <b>would</b> come to the practice that they might understand one another. She is {{not even in the}} Bankside district, so it is no business of hers.' ...|$|R
