25|$|Hinduism has {{incorporated}} {{many kinds}} of prayer (Sanskrit: prārthanā), from fire-based rituals to philosophical musings. While chanting involves 'by dictum' recitation of timeless verses or verses with timings and notations, dhyanam involves deep meditation (however short or long) on the preferred deity/God. Again the object to which prayers are offered could be a persons referred as devtas, trinity or incarnation of either devtas or trinity or simply plain formless meditation as practiced by the ancient sages. These prayers can be directed to fulfilling personal needs or deep spiritual enlightenment, and also {{for the benefit of}} others. Ritual invocation was part <b>and</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vedic religion and as such permeated their sacred texts. Indeed, the highest sacred texts of the Hindus, the Vedas, are a large collection of mantras and prayer rituals. Classical Hinduism came to focus on extolling a single supreme force, Brahman, that is made manifest in several lower forms as the familiar gods of the Hindu pantheon. Hindus in India have numerous devotional movements. Hindus may pray to the highest absolute God Brahman, or more commonly to Its three manifestations namely creator god called Brahma, preserver god called Vishnu and destroyer god (so that the creation cycle can start afresh) Shiva, and at the next level to Vishnu's avatars (earthly appearances) Rama and Krishna or to many other male or female deities. Typically, Hindus pray with their hands (the palms) joined together in pranam. The hand gesture is similar to the popular Indian greeting namaste.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This article {{agrees with}} Meretz (2014) that the peer {{producing}} cooperatives which are pro-posed by Bauwens & Kostakis (2014) will become parts <b>and</b> <b>parcels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capitalist economy. Fur-ther, it {{argues that the}} so called Peer Production Licenses (PPL), originally designed by Dmitry Kleiner (2010), which is <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> their proposal is a rent seeking instrument. Contra Bauwens & Kostakis, it argues that, from <b>the</b> perspectives <b>of</b> both reform and revolution, GPL is profoundly anti-capitalist. The article critiques Meretz`s understanding of exchange and reciprocity, on the one hand, and his under-estimation of GPL`s communist aspect, on the other. On the positive side, the article, explicating <b>the</b> communist nature <b>of</b> GPL-oriented peer production, speculates about <b>the</b> general contours <b>of</b> a socie-ty where peer production is <b>the</b> dominant mode <b>of</b> production. <b>The</b> technological basis <b>of</b> this society, <b>the</b> article suggests, will be digital copying and automation. Spatially, it {{will be based on}} localities that transcend the current division between the city and country, synthesising agriculture with industrial, affective and symbolic production. <b>The</b> rise <b>of</b> a globally unified revolutionary social struggle which adopts peer production as its platform is indispensible for <b>the</b> transformation <b>of</b> capitalism into such a society. A global network of revolutionary peer producing cooperatives which break with market and reduce their relations to it to an absolutely unavoidable necessary minimum can be a significant com-ponent of this social struggle. <b>The</b> building <b>of</b> these revolutionary cooperatives requires a massive exodus from the city to the country...|$|R

He also noted that in the court judgment Ong Ah Chuan v.

He then cited eight instances of the Government's alleged non-compliance with the rule of law, including detention without trial under, inter alia, the ISA and the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act ("CLTPA"); denial of the right of arrested persons to counsel and to visits from their families for a period of time; denial of the rights to freedom of speech and assembly; and the tendency of the executive not to provide reasons for decisions made.

500|$|Thirdly, {{applying}} the subjective test {{in reviewing the}} exercise of discretion under the ISA would mean giving the executive arbitrary powers of detention, rendering such powers unconstitutional and void. The ISA was enacted pursuant to Article 149(1) of the Constitution which, at the time Chng Suan Tze was decided, stated that any provision of a law designed to stop or prevent a number of specified actions threatening national security was valid notwithstanding that it was inconsistent with three of the fundamental liberties protected by the Constitution, or would, apart from Article 149(1) itself, be outside the legislative power of Parliament. However, the Article did not protect the validity of sections 8 and 10 of the ISA against any inconsistency with Article 12(1) of the Constitution, which guarantees equality before the law and {{equal protection of the}} law. In Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor (1980), the Privy Council held that the word law in Article 12, among other provisions, refers to a system of law which incorporates fundamental rules of natural justice that had formed part <b>and</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common law of England that was in operation in Singapore at the commencement of the Constitution. The Court of Appeal expressed the view that although sections 8 and 10 of the ISA were not arbitrary because they permitted detentions only for specific purposes which bore a reasonable relation to the object of the law, if a court could not review the exercise of the discretion, [...] "that discretion would be in actual fact as arbitrary as if the provisions themselves do not restrict the discretion to any purpose and to suggest otherwise would in our view be naive". Therefore, if a subjective test was applied, that would allow for arbitrary detention which would result in inconsistency with Article 12(1).|$|E
