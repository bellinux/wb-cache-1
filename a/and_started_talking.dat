500|$|These insults {{culminated in}} an altercation {{between the two}} on March 16, 2003, at Pride 25. Following a victory over Kevin Randleman, Jackson was given the {{microphone}} <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>talking</b> directly to Silva, who was sitting at ringside, saying [...] "I want you boy. It's gonna be me and you." [...] Silva immediately {{jumped to his feet}} and made his way into the ring. He was now face-to-face with Jackson, who continued by saying, [...] "You have my belt, you're keeping it warm for me." [...] Silva responded by yelling [...] "MY BELT!" [...] and giving Jackson a forceful shove. Jackson, visibly upset, advanced towards Silva as dozens of Pride officials intervened. Jackson stood still as he was surrounded by officials, while Silva had to be constantly restrained from charging at Jackson. Jackson later stated that he was instructed by Pride executives to make these comments. He added that Silva's shove infuriated him, and he was ready to fight Silva immediately.|$|E

But then I rang [...] <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>talking</b> about it and the idea just grew." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{looked up}} and almost {{expected}} fire from heaven. This coincidence was {{like the end of}} the world.
