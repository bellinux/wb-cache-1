5|$|Although the {{scientific}} discipline of astronomy has made tremendous strides {{in understanding the}} nature of the Universe and its contents, there remain some important unanswered questions. <b>Answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> may require the construction of new ground- and space-based instruments, and possibly new developments in theoretical and experimental physics.|$|E
5|$|The precise {{origins of}} the Kuiper belt and its complex {{structure}} are still unclear, and astronomers are awaiting the completion of several wide-field survey telescopes such as Pan-STARRS and the future LSST, which should reveal many currently unknown KBOs. These surveys will provide data that will help determine <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> questions.|$|E
5|$|The Deep Impact {{mission was}} planned to help answer {{fundamental}} questions about comets, which included what {{makes up the}} composition of the comet's nucleus, what depth the crater would reach from the impact, and where the comet originated in its formation. By observing {{the composition of the}} comet, astronomers hoped to determine how comets form based on the differences between the interior and exterior makeup of the comet. Observations of the impact and its aftermath would allow astronomers to attempt to determine the <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> questions.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} {{to improving the}} economy, the lower social classes also had to {{be integrated into the}} new body politic, although they often got few rewards from independence. The political debate seeking <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> questions was marked by a clash—at times on the battlefield—between liberalism and conservatism. Conservatives sought to maintain the traditional social structures in order to ensure stability; liberals sought to create a more dynamic society and economy by ending ethnically-based social distinctions and freeing property from economic restrictions. In its quest to transform society, liberals often adopted policies that were not welcome by Native communities, who had benefited from unique protections afforded to them by traditional Spanish law.|$|E

25|$|Many {{tasks that}} we would like to {{automate}} by using a computer are of question–answer type: we would like to ask a question and the computer should produce an answer. In theoretical computer science, such tasks are called computational problems. Formally, a computational problem consists of instances together with a solution for each instance. Instances are questions that we can ask, and solutions are desired <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> questions.|$|E

Nightlife and Apartment Life allow Sims to gain promotions through social interactions with other Sims.|$|E

These include: developing international and community health programs in developing countries; evaluating the influence {{of social and cultural}} variables in the epidemiology of certain forms of psychiatric pathology (transcultural psychiatry); studying cultural resistance to innovation in therapeutic and care practices; analysing healing practices toward immigrants; and studying traditional healers, folk healers and empirical midwives who may be reinvented as health workers (the so-called barefoot doctors).|$|E

25|$|Levantine {{archaeology}} {{also includes}} the study of Phoenician culture, cosmopolitan in character and widespread in its distribution in the region. According to Benjamin Sass and Christoph Uehlinger, the questions of what is actually Phoenician and what is specifically Phoenician, in Phoenician iconography, constitute one well-known crux of Levantine archaeology. Without <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> questions, the authors contend that research exploring {{the degree to which}} Phoenician art and symbolism penetrated into the different areas of Syria and Palestine will make little progress.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study by}} Føllesdal, the MSCEIT test results of 111 {{business}} leaders were compared with how their employees described their leader. It was {{found that there were}} no correlations between a leader's test results and how he or she was rated by the employees, with regard to empathy, ability to motivate, and leader effectiveness. Føllesdal also criticized the Canadian company Multi-Health Systems, which administers the MSCEIT test. The test contains 141 questions but it was found after publishing the test that 19 of these did not give the expected answers. This has led Multi-Health Systems to remove <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> 19 questions before scoring but without stating this officially.|$|E
25|$|The {{succession}} to Muhammad {{raises questions}} about the leadership of Islam after his death: Muhammad's successor, how they should be elected, conditions of legitimacy and the role of successor. <b>Answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> questions have led to several divisions in the Muslim community since the first century of Muslim history, giving rise to the Sunni, Shia and Khawarij schools. After Muhammad's death in AD 632, disagreement broke out over who should succeed him as leader of the Muslim community. Since none of his sons survived into adulthood, hereditary succession was not an option. Umar (Umar ibn al-Khattab), a prominent companion of Muhammad, nominated Abu Bakr. Others added their support, and Abu Bakr was made the first caliph. This choice was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who believed that Ali (Ali ibn Abi Talib), the Prophet's cousin and son-in-law, had already been designated as his successor by the Prophet. During the First and Second Fitnas the Islamic community divided into a number of groups, each of which had a specific idea about successorship. After the Rashidun caliphate evolved into monarchies and sultanates, Sunnis held power in most areas; Shias emerged in opposition.|$|E

25|$|Religion is {{generally}} {{defined as a}} belief system concerning the supernatural, sacred or divine, and practices, values, institutions and rituals associated with such belief. Some religions also have a moral code. The evolution {{and the history of}} the first religions have recently become areas of active scientific investigation. However, in the course of its development, religion has taken on many forms that vary by culture and individual perspective. Some of the chief questions and issues religions are concerned with include life after death (commonly involving belief in an afterlife), the origin of life, the nature of the universe (religious cosmology) and its ultimate fate (eschatology), and what is moral or immoral. A common source for <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> questions are beliefs in transcendent divine beings such as deities or a singular God, although not all religions are theistic. Spirituality, belief or involvement in matters of the soul or spirit, {{is one of the many}} different approaches humans take in trying to answer fundamental questions about humankind's place in the universe, the meaning of life, and the ideal way to live one's life. Though these topics have also been addressed by philosophy, and to some extent by science, spirituality is unique in that it focuses on mystical or supernatural concepts such as karma and God.|$|E

2500|$|Philosopher and theologian Alvin Plantinga, a {{well-known}} critic of naturalism in general, comments: [...] "Naturalism is presumably not a religion.

There is that range of deep human questions to which a religion typically provides an answer ... Like a typical religion, naturalism gives a set of <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> and similar questions".|$|E
