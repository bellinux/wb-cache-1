40|$|Recognizance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>debt</b> The thesis aims {{to provide}} {{overview}} of judicial and doctrinal solutions of particular issues regarding the recognizance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>debt</b> (as {{governed by the}} Czech Commercial Code) and to discuss {{to what extent the}} generally accepted solutions could stand up once the Act No. 89 / 2012 Coll., the Civil Code (hereinafter referred to as the "New Civil Code") becomes effective. Following the general introduction the recognizance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>debt</b> is described together with similar legal instruments. Then the thesis focuses on particular issues associated with the instrument <b>of</b> recognizance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>debt,</b> such as methods of identification of the debt being recognized, relationship between recognizance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>debt</b> and set-off, ways of explicit and implicit recognizance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>debt</b> etc. The thesis emphasizes the judicial solutions of these issues and the respective doctrinal scrutiny. The commercial law regulation (as governed by the Act No. 513 / 1991 Coll., the Commercial Code) is of the main importance. If appropriate, the civil law regulation (as governed by the Act No. 40 / 1964 Coll., the Civil Code) is used. As the New Civil Code repeals these laws, the thesis looks into the future and attempts to evaluate to what extent the recent conclusions of practice and theory will be applicable. The thesis also [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{whether and}} the extent to which investors respond to the Rule 144 <b>A</b> <b>debt</b> offering through firm’s stock returns. We conduct an event study methodology with 1, 244 Rule 144 <b>A</b> <b>debt</b> offerings from 1990 to 2012 to answer this question. We find that the announcements <b>of</b> Rule 144 <b>A</b> <b>debt</b> offerings are associated with significant negative abnormal returns and these negative effects are more pronounced for the first-time issuers <b>of</b> 144 <b>A</b> <b>debt.</b> On average, 144 <b>A</b> <b>debt</b> issuers make <b>a</b> loss <b>of</b> 9. 5 basis points (US$ 28. 6 million) from the amount <b>of</b> 144 <b>A</b> <b>debt</b> raised. However, we find a reversal effect on abnormal returns following the registration <b>of</b> 144 <b>A</b> <b>debt</b> after 60 days from the issue date. Our findings suggest that ignoring the sample selection bias <b>of</b> 144 <b>A</b> <b>debt</b> issuance choice can lead to erroneous conclusions that 144 <b>A</b> <b>debt</b> does not affect firm’s abnormal returns. In addition, we also find that firms in larger financial deficit tend to issue 144 <b>A</b> <b>debt...</b>|$|R
