40|$|This study {{investigated}} effects of video prompting using an iPod Touch to teach recipe-following to four 16 - 19 year-old youth with intellectual disability and autism in a transition classroom. Target behaviors involved correctly following three multi-step recipes: microwave dinner, brownies, and gelatin. A multiple-probe design across recipes was replicated across participants. After {{low levels of}} responding in baseline probes, researchers presented participants with an iPod Touch showing {{each step of the}} task using video and with <b>audio</b> narration. <b>Following</b> the <b>video</b> prompting phase, maintenance and home-based generalization probes were conducted. The intervention increased recipe-following performance for all participants. Performance maintained and generalized to youths’ home kitchens. Results are discussed in regards to using video demonstrations in a sequence of prompts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a novel alignment approach for imperfect {{speech and the}} corresponding transcription. The algorithm gets started with multi-stage sentence boundary detection in <b>audio,</b> <b>followed</b> by a dynamic programming based search, to find the optimal alignment and detect the mismatches at sentence level. Experiments show promising performance, compared to the traditional forced alignment approach. The proposed algorithm has already been applied in preparing multimedia content for an online English training platform...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} a causal approach to tempo tracking for musical audio signals. Our {{system is designed}} towards an eventual real-time implementation; requiring minimal highlevel knowledge of the musical audio. The tempo tracking system {{is divided into two}} sections: an onset analysis stage, used to derive a rhythmically meaningful representation from the input <b>audio,</b> <b>followed</b> by a beat matching algorithm using auto- and cross-correlative methods to generate short term predictions of future beats in the audio. The algorithm is evaluated over a range of musical styles by comparing the predicted output to beats tapped by a musician. An investigation is also presented into three rhythmically complex beat tracking problems, where the tempo is not constant. Preliminary results demonstrate good accuracy for this type of system...|$|R
