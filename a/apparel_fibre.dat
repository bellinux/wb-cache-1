40|$|Cashmere is {{a luxury}} fibre {{regarded}} as being softer and more comfortable than other <b>apparel</b> <b>fibres.</b> Cashmere is rare. Total cashmere production represents less than 0. 01 % of the textile market. Processed cashmere is expensive. Specialised skills and equipment are required for processing cashmere. For such an expensive textile raw material, surprisingly little objective information has been published on measurable attributes of cashmere in the form used by spinners. This article discusses new information about the softness and other quality attributes of Australian cashmere. Comparisons are made between Australian cashmere and cashmere from traditional sources of supply...|$|R

Indeed wool can be considered as one of the most high-tech of all <b>apparel</b> <b>fibres.</b> In this chapter the benefits of wool in relation to apparel for active sports will be examined against a background of the physiological and sensory processes that create the environment in which wearer comfort must be achieved...|$|R
40|$|In 2010, {{a record}} amount of <b>apparel</b> <b>fibres</b> was consumed, with {{increasing}} demand from developing nations. Over {{the life cycle}} of textile production and consumption however, numerous environmental impacts occur. Since the International Organisation for Standardization developed the first methodological framework, environmental life cycle assessment has become an important tool to comprehensively evaluate impacts of production and consumption. By conducting an environmental life cycle assessment of four garments with highly case specific data, this research helps the local company in India to find most impact causing production inputs as a first step towards impact reduction. Furthermore, this research can be used to assist designers and consumers to make better substantiated choices regarding the environmental impact of the fabrics and garments they purchase. For this purpose, impact assessment has been conducted to allow the results to be submitted to the Materials Sustainability Index from the Sustainable Apparel Coalition. From the results, dyeing and finishing processes consistently show up as the most impact causing process steps. However, the sources of impact differ per impact category. Whereas heat production from fossil fuel combustion is the main source of Global Warming Potential, production of dyes and softeners is the main source of toxicity and eutrophication. As such, this research improves the understanding of environmental impacts from textile production and emphasizes the importance of local and case specific considerations...|$|R
40|$|This paper gives a review, {{based on}} the fibre prospective, {{on the effect of}} {{ultraviolet}} (UV) radiation on the textile fibres. Both natural and synthetic fibres, including cotton, wool, poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and nylon, are the common types of fibre found in textile and <b>apparel.</b> Those textile <b>fibres</b> can help protect human from the harmful effect caused by UV radiation. However, under the influence of UV radiation, those fibres is subjected to various degrees of damage and degradation. In order to understand the interaction of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) between textile substrate, the factors affecting ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) and photodegradation mechanism of those fibres are discussed.

This sector has experienced intense fragmentation {{in the last two}} decades,much of which was driven by the Multifibre Arrangement (MFA). This review shows that post-MFA, firms today face altered conditions of competition that are pushing them to compete on the basis of factors other than price and cost competitiveness. The paper also argues that the attribution of China’s remarkable export performance in textiles and apparel to its low unit costs and large scales of production is, in part, a misreading of the China story. textile exports, <b>apparel</b> exports, Multi <b>Fibre</b> Arrangement, MFA, post-MFA, china, cost competitiveness, scale of production, Economics, International Trade...|$|R

40|$|Description: Integrating {{electronics}} into {{clothing is}} a major new concept, which opens up a whole array of multi-functional, wearable electro-textiles for sensing/monitoring body functions, delivering communication facilities, data transfer, individual environment control, and many other applications. With revolutionary advancements occurring at an unprecedented rate in many fields of science and electronics the possibilities offered by wearable technologies are tremendous and widespread. These advancements will transform the world and will soon begin to permeate into commercial products. The first section of the book discusses the materials and devices used in the field, including electro-statically generated nanofibres, electroceramic fibres and composites and electroactive fabrics. It summarizes recent developments in electrically conductive fabric structures and puts together a few theoretical treatments of the electro-mechanical properties of various fabric structures. The next section reviews topics related to wearable photonics such as fibre optic sensors and integrated smart textile structures, the developments in various flexible photonic display technologies as well as looking at current communication <b>apparel</b> and optical <b>fibre</b> fabric displays. Next the book focuses on integrated structures and system architectures. Finally the issues facing a fashion designe...|$|R
40|$|The {{phase-out}} of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) on 31 December, 2004 {{has important}} implications for all agents in the value chain including apparel manufacturers, exporters, importers, retailers and consumers. This has made possible for apparel manufacturing and exporting countries to operate without the restrictions of the quota; has provided importers an opportunity for open sourcing and retailers to take advantage of competitively priced supply; and provided broader choices and lower prices to consumers. As a result global export of textile and apparels has substantially increased in 2005 (US$ 275. 6 billion with a growth rate of 6. 4 per cent) However, the MFA phase out has not been an unmixed blessings for all apparel producing countries of Asia. There are some apparel exporting countries such as China and India which achieved higher level of growth (44 per cent and 32 per cent respectively); {{at the same time there}} are countries such as Cambodia, Indonesia which achieved moderate level of growth (11 per cent and 10 per cent respectively) and even countries such as Nepal have negative growth. Bangladesh, surprisingly with all the apprehension of losing its market share to major players, has been able to not only increase its export but also been able to sustain it [...] from US$ 6. 4 billion in FY 2005 to US$ 7. 9 billion in FY 2006 and US$ 9. 2 billion in FY 2007. Nevertheless, Bangladesh is still faced with some challenges such as competition with China especially after lifting out safeguard against Chinese apparels in 2008, poor compliance standard etc. The sector has weaknesses in some areas such as lack of diversity in export market, high concentration in few products, and long lead-time etc. Besides, entrepreneurs have to take into account some recent trends in the global apparel market following the MFA phase out, especially in case of buyers’ sourcing patterns (concentrated to few sources), consumers’ choice (relatively more frequent changes in fashion and compared to earlier periods) and marketing techniques (lean retailing), etc. and make necessary adjustment.
