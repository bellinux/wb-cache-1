5|$|After the war ended, Sam took up {{an offer}} from Dee to become Professor of Natural Philosophy at Glasgow University. In Glasgow, the Currans, {{together}} with a few friends, set up the Scottish Society for the Parents of Mentally Handicapped Children (Enable), which eventually grew to 100 branches and more than 5000 members. Later, when Joan {{was a member of}} the Greater Glasgow Health Board and the Scottish Special Housing Association, the needs of the disabled were <b>always</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> forefront of her mind, and she did much to promote their welfare. She took a close interest in the work of the Council for Access for the Disabled and helped improve the range of facilities, especially for disabled university students.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, {{he began a}} {{business}} partnership with producer Martine Marignac, who produced all his subsequent films. Rivette's output increased from then on, with films such as Gang of Four and La Belle Noiseuse receiving international praise. He continued making films until 2009, retiring after the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease made the production of 36 vues du pic Saint-Loup too {{difficult for him to}} continue. Many of his films are known for their long running time, including the 760-minute Out 1. Almost <b>always</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> insistence of the distributors, Rivette edited shorter versions of five of his films and considered some of them to be entirely new films with different meanings.|$|E
5|$|Model was {{the master}} of the type of defense which can be called 'defense limited in time'; in which you defend as long as {{possible}} but then retreat to avoid breakthrough and destruction. He was <b>always</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> critical points and took away battlegroups or even single battalions from less threatened sectors. With these units holes were plugged at other locations or short counterattacks were executed and so opportunities were created for bigger solutions. Thus, a closed front was guaranteed while the mixing and tearing apart of units was viewed as the smaller evil.|$|E
5|$|One {{animator}} {{was dedicated}} full-time during {{three years of}} the game's development to work out the boy's animations, including animations that showed anticipation on the player's actions or events in the game, such as reaching out for a cart handle as the player moved the boy near it. Jensen felt this was important as the character was <b>always</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> center of the player's screen, and the most important element to watch. Playdead included gruesome death sequences to highlight incorrect solutions and discourage players from repeating their mistakes. While they expected players to run the boy into numerous deaths while trying solutions, Carlsen stated that their goal was to ensure death wasn't a penalty in the game, and made the death animations entertaining to keep the player interested. Carlsen noted several early puzzles were too complex for the game, but they would end up using a portion of these larger puzzles in the final release.|$|E

25|$|The Army of the Empire did not {{constitute}} a permanent standing army which was <b>always</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ready {{to fight for the}} Empire. When there was danger, an Army of the Empire was mustered from among the elements constituting it, in order to conduct an imperial military campaign or Reichsheerfahrt during an Imperial War (Reichskrieg) or an Imperial Execution (Reichsexekution). In practice, the imperial troops often had stronger local allegiances than their loyalty to the Emperor.|$|E

He was a good student in primary school and attended high school in Bad Ischl despite his parents' financial situation. Haider was reportedly <b>always</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of his class in high school. During his time in Bad Ischl he had first contacts with nationalist organizations, such as the Burschenschaft Albia, a right-wing student group.|$|E

Chernozubov praised Andranik as a brave and experienced chief, who well understood the combat situation, described him as <b>always</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> head of militia, enjoying great prestige among the volunteers.|$|E
25|$|When Suzuki entered {{school he}} became aware that his family was very poor. Suzuki was {{sensitive}} and kind but prone to quick bursts of anger. The other boys ridiculed him for his shaved head and for being {{the son of a}} priest. He preferred staying in the classroom to playing in the schoolyard, and was <b>always</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of his class. His teacher told him that he should {{grow up to be a}} great man, and to do this he needed to leave Kanagawa Prefecture and study hard.|$|E
25|$|In 1744 he {{produced}} the Ménages assortis and in 1746 his masterpiece, the Coquette fixée. He {{was a close}} friend of Charles Simon Favart and his wife. His pen was <b>always</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> service of any of his friends, and it was generally supposed that he had a considerable share in Favart's most successful operas. Voisenon had scruples all his life about the incongruity between his way of living and his profession, but he continued to write indecent stories for private circulation, and wrote verses in honor of Madame du Barry, as he had done for Madame de Pompadour.|$|E

25|$|The {{use of the}} Doppler {{effect for}} light in {{astronomy}} depends on our knowledge that the spectra of stars are not homogeneous. They exhibit absorption lines at well defined frequencies that are correlated with the energies required to excite electrons in various elements from one level to another. The Doppler effect is recognizable {{in the fact that}} the absorption lines are not <b>always</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> frequencies that are obtained from the spectrum of a stationary light source. Since blue light has a higher frequency than red light, the spectral lines of an approaching astronomical light source exhibit a blueshift and those of a receding astronomical light source exhibit a redshift.|$|E
25|$|The {{sailing vessel}} was <b>always</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{mercy of the}} wind for propulsion, and those that did carry oars were placed at a {{disadvantage}} {{because they were not}} optimized for oar use. The galley did have disadvantages compared to the sailing vessel though. Their smaller hulls were not able to hold as much cargo and this limited their range as the crews were required to replenish food stuffs more frequently. The low freeboard of the galley meant that in close action with a sailing vessel, the sailing vessel would usually maintain a height advantage. The sailing vessel could also fight more effectively farther out at sea and in rougher wind conditions because of the height of their freeboard.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} such efforts to make urban {{development}} more pedestrian friendly is the pedestrian village. This is a compact, pedestrian-oriented neighborhood or town, with a mixed-use village center, that follows the tenets of New Pedestrianism. Shared-use lanes for pedestrians and those using bicycles, Segways, wheelchairs, and other small rolling conveyances that do not use internal combustion engines. Generally, these lanes are {{in front of the}} houses and businesses, and streets for motor vehicles are <b>always</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rear. Some pedestrian villages might be nearly car-free with cars either hidden below the buildings or {{on the periphery of the}} village. Venice, Italy is essentially a pedestrian village with canals. The canal district in Venice, California, on the other hand, combines the front lane/rear street approach with canals and walkways, or just walkways.|$|E
