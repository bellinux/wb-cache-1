40|$|We {{identify}} all {{the periodic}} orbits of the integrable swinging <b>Atwood's</b> <b>machine</b> by calculating the rotation number of each orbit on its invariant tori in phase space, and also providing explicit formulas {{for the initial}} conditions needed to generate each orbit. Typeset using REVT E X I. INTRODUCTION. Integrable Hamiltonian systems typically display an infinity of distinct periodic and quasiperiodic orbits. The bounded Kepler problem often studied in classical mechanics is not typical in this respect since it only exhibits periodic orbits of a simple type. This is because the Kepler problem has a third invariant, the Runge-Lenz vector [1], {{in addition to the}} energy and angular momentum. This third invariant forces all the bounded motions to be periodic.

40|$|A Swinging <b>Atwood</b> <b>Machine</b> (SAM) {{is built}} and some {{experimental}} results concerning its dynamic behaviour are presented. Experiments clearly show that pulleys {{play a role}} in the motion of the pendulum, since they can rotate and have non-negligible radii and masses. Equations of motion must therefore take into account the inertial momentum of the pulleys, as well as the winding of the rope around them. Their influence is compared to previous studies. A preliminary discussion of the role of dissipation is included. The theoretical behaviour of the system with pulleys is illustrated numerically, and the relevance of different parameters is highlighted. Finally, the integrability of the dynamic system is studied, the main result being that the Machine with pulleys is non-integrable. The status of the results on integrability of the pulley-less Machine is also recalled. Comment: 37 page...|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} an experimental design for studying low-velocity collisions into granular surfaces in low-gravity. In the experiment apparatus, reduced-gravity is simulated by releasing a free-falling projectile into a surface container with a downward acceleration {{less than that}} of Earth’s gravity. The acceleration of the surface is controlled through the use of an <b>Atwood</b> <b>machine,</b> or a system of pulleys and counterweights. The starting height of the surface container and the initial separation distance between the projectile and surface are variable and chosen to accommodate collision velocities up to 20 cm/s and effective accelerations of ∼ 0. 1 to 1. 0 m/s 2. Accelerometers, placed on the surface container and inside the projectile, provide acceleration data, while high-speed cameras capture the collision and act as secondary data sources. The experiment is built into an existing 5. 5 m drop tower frame and requires the custom design of all components, including the projectile, surface sample container, release mechanism, and deceleration system. Data from calibration tests verify the efficiency of the experiment’s deceleration system and provide a quantitative understanding of the performance of the Atwood system...|$|E

The gravitational force on the small hanging mass provides the force to accelerate the glider, as seen using the free body diagram of Figure 1, giving the equations: [Equation] where T is {{the tension in the}} string, M is the mass of the glider, m is the mass of the small hanging mass, a is the acceleration of the system, and g is the acceleration of gravity.

40|$|Let us {{consider}} a classical high school exercise concerning two weights on a pulley and a string, illustrated in Fig. 1 (a). A system {{like this is}} called an <b>Atwood's</b> <b>machine</b> and was invented by George Atwood in 1784 as a laboratory experiment to verify the mechanical laws of motion with constant acceleration. Nowadays, <b>Atwood's</b> <b>machine</b> is used for didactic purposes to demonstrate uniformly accelerated motion with acceleration arbitrarily smaller than the gravitational acceleration g. The simplest case is with a massless and frictionless pulley and a massless string. With little effort one can include {{the mass of the}} pulley in calculations. The mass of a string has been incorporated previously in some considerations and experiments. These include treatments focusing on friction, justifying the assumption of a massless string, incorporating variations in Earth's gravitational field, comparing the calculated value of g based on a simple experiment, taking the mass of the string into account {{in such a way that}} the resulting acceleration is constant, or in one exception solely focusing on a heavy string, but with a slightly different approach. Here we wish to provide i) a derivation of the acceleration and position dependence on the weights' masses based purely on basic dynamical reasoning similar to the conventional version of the exercise, and ii) focus on the influence of the string's linear density, or equivalently its mass, on the outcome compared to a massless string case...|$|R
40|$|The {{classical}} <b>Atwood's</b> <b>machine,</b> {{consisting of}} two masses hanging on a light string over a light, frictionless pulley, is used to study force and acceleration. If the masses are nearly equal, the motion may be slow enough that accurate measurements can be made. We can do this by using large masses on each side and increasing the mass on one side by adding a smaller rider. For such a system, shown in Figure 1, we can formulate the equation of motion by considering the free-body drawings for each side. [Equation] [Equation] where M is the larger mass on each side, m is the lighter mass of the rider, T is {{the tension in the}} string, a is the acceleration of the system, and g is the acceleration of gravity. Eliminating T, the equation of motion is [Equation] Thus the two-mass system will move with a constant acceleration, with the side with the rider moving downward. We can determine this acceleration experimentally by using the difference method discussed in detail in Demonstration 01 - 10, where the position of either weight can be measured at a series of equal time intervals. A 10 -cm grid is provided at the right of the <b>Atwood's</b> <b>machine</b> for determination of the vertical scale. In the video the net weight m is removed while the system is accelerating, causing the acceleration to cease and resulting in constant velocity for the system after that point. This can also be verified experimentally by determining the position of either weight at equal time intervals after the small net weight is removed...|$|R
