5|$|Other scriptures {{describe}} other {{visits by}} Shiva to Deodar Forest in his Bhikshatana form. The Vamana Purana mentions Shiva entering the Deodar Forest twice as a beggar. Maddened {{by the death}} of his first wife Sati but chased by the love-god Kamadeva, Shiva escapes to the Deodar Forest and lives as a mendicant. The sages' wives who come to grant him food become sexually excited <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> sight of him. The sages curse his Linga to fall off and it becomes the infinite pillar. Brahma and Vishnu propitiate him and Shiva reabsorbs the Linga into his body. In another instance, while passing the Deodar Forest, Parvati notices sages who worship Shiva and have emaciated their bodies with fasts and severe vows. Parvati requests Shiva to save them from further pain, but Shiva declares that the sages are simply foolish and have not restrained their passion and anger. He enters the forest as a handsome man, wearing only a garland of sylvan flowers. He entices the sages' wives, who give him alms. As before, the Linga of the cursed Shiva falls off, but eventually the sages realise their folly and worship the Linga. Similar accounts of Bhikshatana-Shiva's visit to the Deodar Forest to humble and enlighten the false sages, Bhikshatana-Shiva's emasculation and establishment of Linga worship also appear in the Mahabharata, the Shiva Purana, and the Bhagavata Purana.|$|E
25|$|In the 1919 Cost Accounting Nicholson and Rohrbach again {{deal with}} the admittedly {{controversial}} {{question as to whether}} it is proper to treat normal interest return on passive investment as a part of manufacturing costs, the position is taken that interest on fixed assets should be so charged, but not interest on floating capital investment. The charging of some interest item is considered necessary to the successful distribution of overhead. Or, more exactly, normal return on passive investment is regarded as overhead to be distributed among the factory products. The authors in chapter IV considers that the opposition argument is directed chiefly at the practice of making these charges as part of the regular costs, not <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> calculation thereof for use in statistical report form in the quotation of prices. He therefore suggests (p.140) an accounting procedure supposed to meet this objection.|$|E

25|$|Alex {{is convicted}} of murder and sentenced to 14 years in prison (Pete visiting one day {{informed}} him that Georgie has {{been killed in a}} botched robbery). Two years into his term, he has obtained a job in one of the prison chapels playing religious music on the stereo to accompany the Sunday religious services. The chaplain mistakes Alex's Bible studies for stirrings of faith; in reality, Alex is only reading Scripture for the violent passages. After his fellow cellmates blame him for beating a troublesome cellmate to death, he is chosen to undergo an experimental behaviour-modification treatment called the Ludovico Technique in exchange for having the remainder of his sentence commuted. The technique is a form of aversion therapy, in which Alex is injected with nausea-inducing drugs while watching graphically violent films, eventually conditioning him to become severely ill <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> thought of violence. As an unintended consequence, the soundtrack to one of the films, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, renders Alex unable to enjoy his beloved classical music as before.|$|E
500|$|In higher organisms (like people), {{these two}} modes of {{perception}} combine into what Whitehead terms [...] "symbolic reference", which links appearance with causation {{in a process}} that is so automatic that both people and animals have difficulty refraining from it. [...] By way of illustration, Whitehead uses the example of a person's encounter with a chair. [...] An ordinary person looks up, sees a colored shape, and immediately infers that it is a chair. [...] However, an artist, Whitehead supposes, [...] "might not have jumped to the notion of a chair", but instead [...] "might have stopped <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> contemplation of a beautiful color and a beautiful shape." [...] This is not the normal human reaction; most people place objects in categories by habit and instinct, without even thinking about it. [...] Moreover, animals do the same thing. [...] Using the same example, Whitehead points out that a dog [...] "would have acted immediately on the hypothesis of a chair and would have jumped onto it by way of using it as such." [...] In this way symbolic reference is a fusion of pure sense perceptions {{on the one hand and}} causal relations on the other, and that it is in fact the causal relationships that dominate the more basic mentality (as the dog illustrates), while it is the sense perceptions which indicate a higher grade mentality (as the artist illustrates).|$|E

2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{sentencing}} inside the courtroom, news channel Tv2 recorded Kristiansen reaction {{while he had}} a {{grin on his face}} while chewing chewing-gum.

In a 2008 interview, Kristiansen explained his reaction, saying that he was smiling <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> [...] "absurdity of the situation", he also accused the media of using the clip to portray him as a [...] "cold-blooded monster without emotions". This incident sparked a long legal conflict between Tv2 and the court, due to a law, banning recording of defendants inside court-rooms. Tv2 was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing.|$|E

Stuart ordered his sword and spurs be given to his son. His last whispered words were: [...] "I am resigned; God's will be done." [...] He died at 7:38p.m. on May 12, the following day, before Flora Stuart reached his side. He was 31 years old. Stuart was buried in Richmond's Hollywood Cemetery.

2500|$|In 99BC, Sima Qian became {{embroiled in}} the Li Ling affair, where Li Ling and Li Guangli, two {{military}} officers {{who led a}} campaign against the Xiongnu in the north, were defeated and taken captive. Emperor Wu attributed the defeat to Li Ling, with all government officials subsequently condemning him for it. Sima {{was the only person}} to defend Li Ling, who had never been his friend but whom he respected. Emperor Wu interpreted Sima's defence of Li as an attack on his brother-in-law, Li Guangli, who had also fought against the Xiongnu without much success, and sentenced Sima to death. At that time, execution could be commuted either by money or castration. Since Sima did not have enough money to atone his [...] "crime", he chose the latter and was then thrown into prison, where he endured three years. He described his pain thus: [...] "When you see the jailer you abjectly touch the ground with your forehead. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> sight of his underlings you are seized with terror... Such ignominy can never be wiped away." [...] Sima called his castration [...] "the worst of all punishments".|$|E
2500|$|These ideas {{might be}} linked {{to those of the}} renowned {{structural}} linguist Roman Jakobson, who claimed that [...] "the sucking activities of the child are accompanied by a slight nasal murmur, the only phonation to be produced when the lips are pressed to the mother's breast... and the mouth is full". He proposed that later in the infant's development, [...] "this phonatory reaction to nursing is reproduced as an anticipatory signal <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> sight of food and finally as a manifestation of a desire to eat, or more generally, as an expression of discontent and impatient longing for missing food or absent nurser, and any ungranted wish." [...] So, the action of opening and shutting the mouth, combined with the production of a nasal sound when the lips are closed, yielded the sound sequence [...] "Mama", which may therefore count as the very first word. Peter MacNeilage sympathetically discusses this theory in his major book, The Origin of Speech, linking it with Dean Falk's [...] "putting the baby down" [...] theory (see above). Needless to say, other scholars have suggested completely different candidates for Homo sapiens very first word.|$|E
2500|$|His exalted social {{position}} also remained fundamentally ambivalent. Allied to the aristocracy by his consular ancestry and through Sulla, he disliked Sulla personally and worked against the Sullan constitution, {{and his family}} gens was of recent vintage and not fully accepted by the nobility. Pompey maintained links to the Populares and joined Caesar in the triumvirate. Yet, to the contrary, he was well suited to associate with the senate oligarchy because his [...] "dignified outward appearance, his solemn formality, his personal bravery, his decorous private life, his want of all initiative" [...] and his [...] "mediocrity, so characteristic of the genuine Optimate". An [...] "affinity" [...] existed, [...] "subsisted at all times between Pompeius, [...] burgesses and the senate." [...] Pompeius, however, refused to fit in. [...] "eized with giddiness on the height of glory which he had climbed with dangerous rapidity and ease", he began to compare himself to Alexander the Great, and far above any senator. [...] "His political position was utterly perverse." [...] He was conflicted; [...] "deeply indignant when persons and laws did not bend unconditionally before him" [...] he nonetheless [...] "trembled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> thought of doing anything unconstitutional." [...] His [...] "much agitated life passed joylessly away in a perpetual inward contradition." [...] Pompey for Mommsen was the [...] "most tiresome and most starched of all artificial great men." [...] He died before his wife and son, {{when one of his}} old soldiers stabbed him from behind as he stepped ashore in Egypt. [...] "Of all pitiful parts there is none more pitiful than that of passing for more than one really is." ...|$|E
