5|$|Astronomical {{distances}} {{are sometimes}} expressed in light-years, especially in popular science publications and media. A light-year is the distance light travels in one year, around 9461billion kilometres, 5879billion miles, or 0.3066 parsecs. In round figures, a light year is nearly 10trillion kilometres or nearly 6trillion miles. Proxima Centauri, the closest star to Earth <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> is around 4.2 light-years away.|$|E
5|$|Once {{considered}} {{as having the}} largest angular diameter of any star in the sky <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> Betelgeuse lost that distinction in 1997 {{when a group of}} astronomers measured R Doradus with a diameter of 57.0 ± 0.5mas, although R Doradus, being much closer to Earth at about 200ly, has a linear diameter roughly one-third that of Betelgeuse.|$|E
5|$|The Moon has an {{exceptionally}} low albedo, {{giving it a}} reflectance that is slightly brighter than that of worn asphalt. Despite this, it is the brightest object in the sky <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> This {{is partly due to}} the brightness enhancement of the opposition effect; at quarter phase, the Moon is only one-tenth as bright, rather than half as bright, as at full moon.|$|E

5|$|Sól is {{referenced}} in the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, {{where she}} is introduced in chapter 8 in a quote from stanza 5 of Völuspá. In chapter 11 of Gylfaginning, Gangleri (described as King Gylfi in disguise) asks the enthroned figure of High how the sun and moon are steered. High describes that Sól {{is one of the}} two children of Mundilfari, and states that the children were so beautiful they were named <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> (Sól) and the moon (Máni). Mundilfari has Sól married to a man named Glenr.|$|E
5|$|The Moon is in {{synchronous}} rotation with Earth, always {{showing the}} same face, with its near side marked by dark volcanic maria that fill {{the spaces between}} the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters. As seen from the Earth, it is the second-brightest regularly visible celestial object in Earth's sky, <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> Its surface is actually dark, although compared to the night sky it appears very bright, with a reflectance just slightly {{higher than that of}} worn asphalt. Its gravitational influence produces the ocean tides, body tides, and the slight lengthening of the day.|$|E
5|$|The second book, Thunder Rising, {{takes place}} {{a couple of}} months <b>after</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> Trail. Turtle Tail returns to Gray Wing's group {{pregnant}} by an aggressive kittypet tomcat named Tom, and becomes Gray Wing's mate. A fire breaks out in the forest, forcing Clear Sky's group to take shelter with Gray Wing. While taking shelter with Gray Wing, Clear Sky realizes that he was wrong about Thunder and invites him to join his group. Thunder quickly accepts the offer, but soon realizes that his father is too power-hungry and concentrated on the needs of the group over the individual and leaves.|$|E
25|$|<b>After</b> <b>The</b> <b>Suns</b> report, <b>the</b> {{newspaper}} was boycotted by most newsagents in Liverpool and many readers cancelled their orders {{and refused to}} buy it from newsagents; and from then afterwards many in Liverpool refer to <b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> newspaper as <b>The</b> Scum. Some even refuse to say the name or spell it as The S*n. The Hillsborough Justice Campaign organised a less successful national boycott that had some impact on the paper's sales nationally.|$|R

5|$|The {{outer edge}} of the {{terrestrial}} region, between 2 and 4AU from the Sun, is called the asteroid belt. The asteroid belt initially contained more than enough matter to form 2–3 Earth-like planets, and, indeed, a large number of planetesimals formed there. As with the terrestrials, planetesimals in this region later coalesced and formed 20–30 Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos; however, the proximity of Jupiter meant that after this planet formed, 3million years <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> the region's history changed dramatically. Orbital resonances with Jupiter and Saturn are particularly strong in the asteroid belt, and gravitational interactions with more massive embryos scattered many planetesimals into those resonances. Jupiter's gravity increased the velocity of objects within these resonances, causing them to shatter upon collision with other bodies, rather than accrete.|$|E
5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of −1.46, Sirius is {{the brightest star}} system in the night sky, almost twice {{the brightness of the}} second brightest star, Canopus. It is not as bright as the Moon, Venus, or Jupiter; at times, Mercury and Mars are also brighter than Sirius. Sirius can be seen from almost everywhere on Earth, with only observers north of 73 degrees latitude unable to see it, and it does not rise very high when viewed from some northern cities, reaching only 13° above the horizon from Saint Petersburg. Sirius, along with Procyon and Betelgeuse, forms one of the three vertices of the Winter Triangle to observers in the Northern Hemisphere. Due to its declination of roughly −17°, Sirius is a circumpolar star from latitudes south of 73° S. From the Southern Hemisphere in early July, Sirius can be seen in both the evening where it sets <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> and in the morning where it rises before the Sun. Due to precession (and slight proper motion), Sirius will move further south in the future. Starting around the year 9000, Sirius will no longer be visible from northern and central Europe, and in 14000 its declination will be −67° and thus it will be circumpolar throughout South Africa and in most parts of Australia.|$|E
25|$|William McCrea, in 1963, divided {{them into}} 2 groups also: those that relate the {{formation}} of the planets to {{the formation of}} the Sun and those where it is independent of {{the formation of the}} Sun, where the planets form <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> becomes a normal star.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, the New Jersey Nets hired Cartwright as an {{assistant}} coach under Lawrence Frank.

25|$|Research {{suggests}} that sleep patterns vary significantly across cultures. The most striking differences are between societies that have plentiful sources of artificial light and {{ones that do}} not. The primary difference appears to be that pre-light cultures have more broken-up sleep patterns. For example, people without artificial light might go to sleep far sooner <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> sets, but then wake up several times throughout the night, punctuating their sleep with periods of wakefulness, perhaps lasting several hours.|$|E
25|$|As {{explained}} below, {{the blessing}} is recited {{on the morning}} <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> completes its cycle; ideally, it should be recited at sunrise, referred to in Jewish law as haneitz hachammah. It is preferred to recite the blessing with a multitude of people, {{in keeping with the}} principle of b'rov am hadrat melech. The Magen Avraham and the Levush insist that it be recited within the first three hours after sunrise. The Mishnah Brurah, however, states on behalf of numerous Achronim that it is permitted the blessing to be recited until halachic noon.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} way, the planet Jupiter {{is the king}} of the other planets, a giant in size with spectacular, brightly colored clouds and intense storms. Some astronomers believe that it plays an {{important}} protecting role in using its massive gravity to capture or expel from the solar system many comets and asteroids that would otherwise threaten Earth and the inner planets. Jupiter takes 11.9 years to orbit the Sun, spending almost an earth year (361 days) in each sign of the zodiac. Furthermore, Jupiter is usually the fourth-brightest object in the sky (<b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> the Moon and Venus).|$|E
50|$|Construction of {{this arena}} began in 1990, as Suns owner Jerry Colangelo envisioned {{a need for}} a new playing {{facility}} to replace Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum.

25|$|In Williams and Cremin the {{categories}} are: (1) models that regard {{the origin and}} formation of the planets as being essentially related to the Sun, with the 2 formation processes taking place concurrently or consecutively, (2) models that regard formation of the planets as being independent of the formation process of the Sun, the planets forming <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> becomes a normal star; this has 2 subcategories: a) where the material {{for the formation of}} the planets is extracted either from the Sun or another star, b) where the material is acquired from interstellar space. They conclude that the best models are Hoyle's magnetic coupling and McCrea's floccules.|$|E

25|$|Much of Egyptian mythology {{consists}} of origin myths, explaining {{the beginnings of}} various elements of the world, including human institutions and natural phenomena. Kingship arises among the gods {{at the beginning of}} time and later passed to the human pharaohs; warfare originates when humans begin fighting each other <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> god's withdrawal into the sky. Myths also describe the supposed beginnings of less fundamental traditions. In a minor mythic episode, Horus becomes angry with his mother Isis and cuts off her head. Isis replaces her lost head with that of a cow. This event explains why Isis was sometimes depicted with the horns of a cow as part of her headdress.|$|E
25|$|Stockholm's {{location}} {{just south}} of the 60th latitude means that the number of daylight hours is relatively small during winter— about six hours, while in June and the first half of July, the nights are relatively short, with about 18 hours of daylight. Around the Summer solstice the sun never reaches further below the horizon than 7.3 degrees. This gives the sky a bright blue colour in summer once the sun has set, because it does not get any darker than nautical twilight. Also, when looking straight up towards the zenith, few stars are visible <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> has gone down. This is {{not to be confused with}} the midnight sun, which occurs north of the Arctic Circle, around 7 degrees farther north.|$|E
