Lexmark continued manufacturing the Model M in the United States, United Kingdom and Mexico, with IBM being Lexmark's major customer. Many of these keyboards had IBM <b>assembly</b> <b>part</b> numbers such as 52G9658, 52G9700, 82G2383 and 42H1292. Due to pricing pressures, many Model M's in this period were manufactured with a new lower-cost design including lighter plastic, an integrated cable, and a single color for key legends.|$|E

Part number 1391401, and most variants based on it, has a gray IBM logo in a recessed oval at the board's upper left.

The current practice in aircraft parts {{manufacturing process}} is that the manufacturing cycle is long, the rework rate is high and the manufacturing precision is difficult to improve. This can be sometimes infeasible or very costly. In this paper, we consider a fit degree calculation method to achieve precision aircraft parts with economical manufacturing processes. We consider an analytical approach to establish a physical process model to guide the design and machining process of <b>assembly</b> <b>parts,</b> which can assume the fit degree. The {{results show that the}} approach can obtain the nearly optimal process parameters at designated fit degree. At last, a case is developed to verify the proposed methods...|$|R

5000|$|Before 1884 {{the colonial}} {{administration}} of British Honduras was rather haphazard.
