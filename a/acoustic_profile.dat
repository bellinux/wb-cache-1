The audience seats, which had not been altered since a prior renovation in 1906, were replaced by modern seating designed to replicate the unique shape of the original furniture. In addition, the audio/visual and lighting systems of the Great Hall were updated to modern standards, including installation of ceiling-mounted digital projectors and intelligent lighting fixtures, to meet the increasing demands of hosted and student events. The hallway and lobby leading to the Great Hall were also redecorated during the renovation period, with additions featuring historical information and primary source documents relevant to the space. In 2015, the Great Hall hosted a musical tribute devoted to the men, women and children affected by the American Civil War over 150 years before.|$|E

40|$|We derive and numerically verify {{a simple}} {{analytical}} approximation for {{the calculation of}} Brillouin gain spectra (BGS) in acoustically antiguiding optical fibers. We use our approximation to find acoustic speed profiles that minimize the peak Brillouin gain. The optimized BGS are top-hat-shaped, regardless of the optical mode distribution, with peak value inversely proportional to the effective area of the optical mode. We further investigate acoustically guiding speed profiles, in which acoustic waveguide modes lead to peaks in the Brillouin gain spectrum. However, for large cores with diameters down to 50 µm, and often even smaller, these Brillouin gain peaks are spectrally dense, and can be smeared out due to broadening in many practical systems.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 The {{extent to}} which thermo{{acoustic}} data determines the acoustic properties of an object was studied. In the case of one dimensional thermoacoustic imaging it was shown that constant <b>acoustic</b> <b>profiles</b> are uniquely specified from measurements. For a radial thermoacoustic problem we have shown that if the acoustic source is radial then constant acoustic speeds are uniquely determined from the data. The case of a radial thermoacoustic setup with a non-radial source was investigated. It was shown that constant <b>acoustic</b> <b>profiles</b> are uniquely determined within a special class of radial acoustic speeds. An investigation of the interior transmission problem was carried out. A variational form for this problem was found for {{a new class of}} refractive indexes, existence of an infinite discrete set of transmission eigenvalues was established. The study of the unique determination of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>profiles</b> used a relation between data generated from two distinct sound speeds and the spectrum of the transmission problem. The general transmission problem with a new class of refractive indexes was analyzed using Hardy's inequality. Results in the one dimensional and radial cases relate the transmission spectrum to the spectrum of an eigenvalue problem associated to a system of Sturm-Liouville equations. Asymptotic expansions of solutions to the Sturm-Liouville equations were used, together with a special boundary condition, to study this spectrum and derive the uniqueness results...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To acoustically {{evaluate}} {{the cries of}} SIDS infants and compare these cry features {{to a group of}} healthy term (HT) infants, as well as previously published results for SIDS infants. Methods: Pain-induced crying episodes were collected from four infants during the first weeks of life that later died of SIDS. Temporal and spectral features of each crying episode were characterized based on measures of cry duration, cry fundamental frequency (F 0), and cry formant frequencies (F 1 and F 2). Results: The SIDS infants were found to produce cries with longer duration compared to HT infants. The cries of SIDS infants also differed from HT infants in regard to the absolute difference in F 2 F 1 frequency. Conclusions: The acoustic features considered in the present study support the contention that the cries of SIDS infants are reflective of atypical respiratory laryngeal control.

The present study was designed to examine the verbal and acoustic correlates of driving anger, as well as whether emotion regulation strategies such as cognitive reappraisal are effective at reducing the outward expression of anger while driving. Forty-four participants were asked to drive in an emotionally neutral and an anger-provoking simulated driving scenarios, while their driving behavior as well as their speech was recorded. Participants were randomly assigned to two experimental conditions, with one group receiving instructions to reappraise the anger-provoking events and a control group receiving no instructions. Results show that in the anger-provoking scenario, participants exhibited more violations, horn-honking, and cursing.

The profiles are traditionally inspected by sight to identify features of interest which is time-consuming and requires an experienced human’s eye. I have developed a method using eigenimage analysis that can automatically distinguish between three different types of seafloor features found in the fjords of Nootka Sound: Sediment, sills, and rockslides. The method uses a training set of features to build eigenimages that represent the orthogonal variance between different features. Test features are projected onto the eigenimages and compared to the average three feature types. The resulting projection coefficients are a signature characteristic to each feature type {{and can be used}} to identify and classify seafloor features.

The {{current study was}} designed to examine representative disorders of the skin by use of a reflective scanning acoustic microscope (R-SAM), and to determine whether the obtainable resolution was sufficient to render a microscopic diagnosis. An Olympus UH 3 Scanning Acoustic Microscope was utilized with lenses producing burst wave frequencies at 600 and 800 MHz (600 and 800 million cycles/sec). Cutaneous tissue specimens representing 12 different neoplastic and inflammatory disorders were examined. Acoustic images of unstained sections were com- pared with conventional light microscopic study of sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin. In most neoplasms examined, it was possible to make a specific diagnosis primarily from low magnification pattern analysis. Although individual cells could be visualized, cytologic atypia was poorly defined. In the inflammatory disorders, a specific diagnosis was possible in all but bullous pemphigoid and lichen planus, because the composition of the inflammatory infiltrate was difficult to determine.

The ideal acoustic field did not adequately represent the measured field having different temperature profiles (errors 10 % to 20 %). Experimental field was concentrated near the transducer producing a region with higher temperatures, while the modeled ideal temperature was linearly distributed along the depth.

One of the strongest criticisms of cervical auscultation is that there has been little research to demonstrate how dysphagic swallowing sounds are different from normal swallowing sounds, In order to answer this question, however, one first needs to document the acoustic characteristics of normal, nondysphagic swallowing sounds, This article provides the first normative database of normal swallowing sounds for the adult population. The current investigation documents the acoustic characteristics of normal swallowing sounds for individuals from 18 to more than 60 years of age over a range of thin liquid volumes. Previous research has shown the normal swallow to be a dynamic event. The normal swallow is sensitive to aging of the oropharyngeal system, and also to the volume of bolus swallowed.

40|$|Although {{its role}} is {{frequently}} stressed in <b>acoustic</b> <b>profile</b> for vocal emotion, sound intensity is frequently {{regarded as a}} control parameter in neurocognitive studies of vocal emotion, leaving its role and neural underpinnings unclear. To investigate these issues, we asked participants to rate the angry level of neutral and angry prosodies before and after sound intensity modification in Experiment 1, and recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) for mismatching emotional prosodies with and without sound intensity modification and for matching emotional prosodies while participants performed emotional feature or sound intensity congruity judgment in Experiment 2. It was found that sound intensity modification had {{significant effect on the}} rating of angry level for angry prosodies, but not for neutral ones. Moreover, mismatching emotional prosodies, relative to matching ones, induced enhanced N 2 /P 3 complex and theta band synchronization irrespective of sound intensity modification and task demands. However, mismatching emotional prosodies with reduced sound intensity showed prolonged peak latency and decreased amplitude in N 2 /P 3 complex and smaller theta band synchronization. These findings suggest that though it cannot categorically affect emotionality conveyed in emotional prosodies, sound intensity contributes to emotional significance quantitatively, implying that sound intensity should not simply be taken as a control parameter and its unique role needs to be specified in vocal emotion studies...|$|E

The target saline aquifer dips 1 – 3 ° southwest and thus crops out 14 – 16 km northeast from the proposed injection site in both offshore and onshore settings. Since the aquifer is exposed at the surface, a carefully documented pre-injection baseline study is required prior to any injection. The seafloor and its subsurface conditions are analysed and interpreted, where the targeted aquifer and organic-rich top-seal shales sub-crop. High-resolution multibeam bathymetric and backscatter imaging, sub-bottom <b>acoustic</b> <b>profiles,</b> sidescan sonar data and multichannel 2 D seismic data were used to analyse seepage-related features on the seafloor and their link to subsurface tectonic structures.

40|$|The {{air blast}} tunnel (ABT) at MoD Shoeburyness {{is a unique}} testing {{facility}} capable of simulating pressure regimes recorded in long-duration blast events. Long-duration blasts are typically defined by a positive phase duration greater than 100 ms, observed in the far field of large explosions. Due to its highly brittle nature, glass panels require high-speed data capture to provide reliable engineering information about their response to blast loading. The harsh environment of the ABT makes accurate collection of this data very difficult. Current methods of data capture depend on interpretation of high-speed video footage, the accuracy of which is severely affected by shock wave induced camera shake. In a series of five companion static loading tests, two different methods of recording glass failure time were trialled; a circuit of conductive paint {{on the surface of}} the glass and a series of piezo transducers to record the <b>acoustic</b> <b>profile</b> at breakage. High-speed photography provided an independent correlation. Experimental results demonstrate that piezo transducers are a low-cost and comparatively accurate method of determining the time of glass failure and crack location in a static testing environment.

Recordings of ambient noise made during the day showed coral reef communities produced <b>acoustic</b> <b>profiles</b> that varied spatially across the Archipelago. At eleven reef sites in the north of the Archipelago, data were also collected on fish and benthic communities using standard visual survey techniques. These data, along with existing survey data from 40 reef sites, were compared with short-term (2 minute) <b>acoustic</b> <b>profiles</b> to explore associations between point sampled acoustic and census data. Using a correlation matrix, the best predictors of acoustic characteristics were identified from a range of factors, including fish density and biomass, coral and fish diversity, coral and algal cover, reef depth and sea state. Multiple regression GLMs highlighted the importance of fish density and diversity on noise below 1 kHz, and coral and benthic diversity on noise above 1 kHz. A positive correlation was also found between coral cover and daytime noise intensity across the entire Archipelago, suggesting potential in the future development of passive acoustics as a method for rapid ecological assessment or for long-term monitoring of reefs.
