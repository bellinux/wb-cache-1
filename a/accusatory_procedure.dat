However, the care with which the evidence was produced and examined by the institutions that adopted the inquisitorial procedure deserves to be emphasized, especially for the consequences it had in certain types of imaginary crime such as witchcraft...|$|E

The rise of legal commentaries and consultations during this time lead to the inclusion of law in Universitiesâ€™ curricula. This fueled a detailed reflection of the principles underlying prosecution for magic. The early fourteenth century brought about the pinnacle of trials involving magic. In this time, several individuals were charged with using magic against both Pope John XXII and the King of France. These trials only enhanced the already growing concern about magic, and thus perpetuated the increasing severity of punishments for such actions. The increase in trials in the late Middle Ages was also {{in part due to}} the shift from <b>accusatory</b> to inquisitorial <b>procedures.</b> In <b>accusatory</b> <b>procedures,</b> the accuser had to provide ample evidence to prove the guilt of the accused. If the accuser failed to do so, or did not have any proof, he or she would have to face the punishment that would have been assigned to the accused had he/she been found guilty. The inquisitorial procedure allowed judges to undertake prosecution on their own initiative without consequences. This made it easier for the accuser to secure conviction for sorcery, and {{not have to worry about}} having insufficient evidence thus putting their own innocence in jeopardy. Inquisitorial interrogation took many forms, including experiments with reflecting surfaces, invocation of demons, use of human heads to obtain love or hatred, and more.|$|R
