5|$|Colchicine is an {{alternative}} for those unable to tolerate NSAIDs. At high doses, side effects (primarily gastrointestinal upset) limit its usage. At lower doses, which are still effective, it is well tolerated. Colchicine may interact with other commonly prescribed drugs, such as <b>atorvastatin</b> and erythromycin, among others.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the expense}} of {{refining}} pure fluorine, most commercial applications use fluorine compounds, with about half of mined fluorite used in steelmaking. The rest of the fluorite is converted into corrosive hydrogen fluoride en route to various organic fluorides, or into cryolite which {{plays a key role}} in aluminium refining. Organic fluorides have very high chemical and thermal stability; their major uses are as refrigerants, electrical insulation and cookware, the last as PTFE (Teflon). Pharmaceuticals such as <b>atorvastatin</b> and fluoxetine also contain fluorine, and the fluoride ion inhibits dental cavities, and so finds use in toothpaste and water fluoridation. Global fluorochemical sales amount to more than US$15 billion a year.|$|E
5|$|Protease inhibitors, nefazodone, sertraline, grapefruit, fluoxetine, erythromycin, diltiazem, {{clarithromycin}} {{inhibit the}} metabolism of midazolam, {{leading to a}} prolonged action. St John's wort, rifapentine, rifampin, rifabutin, phenytoin enhance the metabolism of midazolam leading to a reduced action. Sedating antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and carbamazepine, sedative antihistamines, opioids, antipsychotics and alcohol enhance the sedative effects of midazolam. Midazolam is metabolized almost completely by cytochrome P450-3A4. <b>Atorvastatin</b> administration along with midazolam results in a reduced elimination rate of midazolam. St John's wort decreases the blood levels of midazolam. Grapefruit juice reduces intestinal 3A4 and results in less metabolism and higher plasma concentrations.|$|E
5|$|Twenty {{percent of}} modern {{pharmaceuticals}} contain fluorine. One of these, the cholesterol-reducer <b>atorvastatin</b> (Lipitor), made more revenue {{than any other}} drug until it became generic in 2011. The combination asthma prescription Seretide, a top-ten revenue drug in the mid-2000s, contains two active ingredients, one of which – fluticasone – is fluorinated. Many drugs are fluorinated to delay inactivation and lengthen dosage periods because the carbon–fluorine bond is very stable. Fluorination also increases lipophilicity because the bond is more hydrophobic than the carbon–hydrogen bond, and this often helps in cell membrane penetration and hence bioavailability.|$|E
5|$|In chapter five Goldacre {{suggests}} {{using the}} General Practice Research Database in the UK, which contains the anonymized records of several million patients, to conduct randomized trials {{to determine the}} most effective of competing treatments. For example, to compare two statins, <b>atorvastatin</b> and simvastatin, doctors would randomly assign patients to one or the other. The patients would be followed up by having data about their cholesterol levels, heart attacks, strokes and deaths taken from their computerized medical records. The trials would not be blind– patients would know which statin they had been prescribed– but Goldacre writes {{that they would be}} unlikely to hold such firm beliefs about which one is preferable {{to the extent that it}} could affect their health.|$|E
25|$|<b>Atorvastatin</b> {{undergoes}} rapid absorption {{when taken}} orally, with an approximate time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of 1–2 h. The absolute bioavailability {{of the drug}} is about 14%, but the systemic availability for HMG-CoA reductase activity is approximately 30%. <b>Atorvastatin</b> undergoes high intestinal clearance and first-pass metabolism, which is the main cause for the low systemic availability. Administration of <b>atorvastatin</b> with food produces a 25% reduction in Cmax (rate of absorption) and a 9% reduction in AUC (extent of absorption), although food {{does not affect the}} plasma LDL-C-lowering efficacy of <b>atorvastatin.</b> Evening dose administration is known to reduce the Cmax and AUC by 30% each. However, time of administration does not affect the plasma LDL-C-lowering efficacy of <b>atorvastatin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Several genetic polymorphisms {{have been}} found to be {{associated}} with a higher incidence of undesirable side effects of <b>atorvastatin.</b> This phenomenon is suspected to be related to increased plasma levels of pharmacologically active metabolites, such as <b>atorvastatin</b> lactone and p-hydroxyatorvastatin. <b>Atorvastatin</b> and its active metabolites may be monitored in potentially susceptible patients using specific chromatographic techniques.|$|E
25|$|Co-administration of <b>atorvastatin</b> {{with one}} of CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, telithromycin, and voriconazole, may {{increase}} serum concentrations of <b>atorvastatin,</b> which may lead to adverse reactions. This {{is less likely to}} happen with other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, protease inhibitors, or verapamil, and only rarely with other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as amiodarone and aprepitant. Often, bosentan, fosphenytoin, and phenytoin, which are CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of <b>atorvastatin.</b> Only rarely, though, barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, and rifamycin, which are also CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of <b>atorvastatin.</b> Oral contraceptives increased AUC values for norethisterone and ethinylestradiol; these increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking <b>atorvastatin.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Atorvastatin</b> {{was first}} made in August 1985 at Warner-Lambert's Parke-Davis {{research}} facility in Ann Arbor, Michigan {{by a team}} led by Bruce Roth. From 1996 to 2012 under the trade name Lipitor, <b>atorvastatin</b> became the world's best-selling drug to that point, with more than US$125 billion in sales over approximately 14.5 years. , in the UK, <b>atorvastatin</b> costs about 2 pounds per month.|$|E
25|$|Markedly {{elevated}} CPK levels or if a myopathy {{is suspected}} or diagnosed after dosing of <b>atorvastatin</b> has begun. Very rarely, <b>atorvastatin</b> may cause rhabdomyolysis, {{and it may}} be very serious leading to acute renal failure due to myoglobinuria. If rhabdomyolysis is suspected or diagnosed, <b>atorvastatin</b> therapy should be discontinued immediately. The likelihood of developing a myopathy is increased by the co-administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, niacin, and azole antifungals.|$|E
25|$|Lipitor, Sortis (<b>atorvastatin)</b> for cholesterol.|$|E
25|$|In other countries, <b>atorvastatin</b> calcium {{is made in}} tablet form by {{generic drug}} makers under various brand names {{including}} Stator, <b>Atorvastatin</b> Teva, Litorva, Torid, Atoris, Atorlip, Mactor, Lipvas, Sortis, Torvast, Torvacard, Totalip, and Tulip. Pfizer also makes its own generic version under the name Zarator.|$|E
25|$|Myopathy with {{elevation}} of creatine kinase (CK, aka CPK) and rhabdomyolysis {{are the most}} serious side effects, occurring rarely {{at a rate of}} 2.3 to 9.1 per 10,000 person-years among patients taking <b>atorvastatin.</b> As mentioned previously, <b>atorvastatin</b> should be discontinued immediately if this occurs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Atorvastatin</b> is {{primarily}} eliminated via hepatic biliary excretion, {{with less than}} 2% recovered in the urine. Bile elimination follows hepatic and/or extrahepatic metabolism. There {{does not appear to}} be any entero-hepatic recirculation. <b>Atorvastatin</b> has an approximate elimination half-life of 14 h. Noteworthy, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity appears to have a half-life of 20–30 h, which is thought to be due to the active metabolites. <b>Atorvastatin</b> is also a substrate of the intestinal P-glycoprotein efflux transporter, which pumps the drug back into the intestinal lumen during drug absorption.|$|E
25|$|Geriatric {{patients}} (>65 years old) exhibit altered pharmacokinetics of <b>atorvastatin</b> {{compared to}} young adults, with mean AUC and Cmax {{values that are}} 40% and 30% higher, respectively. Additionally, healthy elderly patients show a greater pharmacodynamic response to <b>atorvastatin</b> at any dose; therefore, this population may have lower effective doses.|$|E
25|$|Pfizer's {{patent on}} <b>atorvastatin</b> expired in November 2011.|$|E
25|$|High-dose <b>atorvastatin</b> {{have also}} been {{associated}} with worsening glycemic control.|$|E
25|$|A {{few cases}} of {{myopathy}} {{have been reported}} when <b>atorvastatin</b> is given with colchicine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Atorvastatin,</b> marketed {{under the}} trade name Lipitor among others, {{is a member}} of the drug class known as statins, which are used {{primarily}} as a lipid-lowering agent and for prevention of events associated with cardiovascular disease. Like all statins, <b>atorvastatin</b> works by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme found in liver tissue that plays a key role in production of cholesterol in the body.|$|E
25|$|Hemodialysis: Hemodialysis {{will not}} {{significantly}} alter drug levels or change clinical effect of <b>atorvastatin.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{have been}} shown to occur in 1–10% of patients taking <b>atorvastatin</b> in clinical trials.|$|E
25|$|Pregnancy: <b>Atorvastatin</b> {{may cause}} fetal harm by {{affecting}} serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels, which {{are essential for}} fetal development.|$|E
25|$|Renal impairment: Renal {{disease has}} no {{influence}} on plasma concentrations of <b>atorvastatin</b> and dosing {{need not be}} adjusted in these patients.|$|E
25|$|Breastfeeding: Small {{amounts of}} other statin drugs {{have been found}} to pass into breast milk, {{although}} <b>atorvastatin</b> has not been studied, specifically.|$|E
25|$|Co-administration of {{grapefruit}} juice with <b>atorvastatin</b> may cause {{an increase in}} Cmax and AUC, {{which can lead to}} adverse reactions or overdose toxicity.|$|E
25|$|Hepatic impairment: In {{patients}} with chronic alcoholic liver disease, levels of <b>atorvastatin</b> may be significantly increased depending upon the extent of liver disease.|$|E
25|$|The first {{synthesis}} of <b>atorvastatin</b> at Parke-Davis {{that occurred during}} drug discovery was racemic followed by chiral chromatographic separation of the enantiomers. An early enantioselective route to <b>atorvastatin</b> made use of an ester chiral auxiliary to set the stereochemistry {{of the first of}} the two alcohol functional groups via a diastereoselective aldol reaction. Once the compound entered pre-clinical development, process chemistry developed a cost-effective and scalable synthesis. In atorvastatin's case, a key element of the overall synthesis was ensuring stereochemical purity in the final drug substance, and hence establishing the first stereocenter became a key aspect of the overall design. The final commercial production of <b>atorvastatin</b> relied on a chiral pool approach, where the stereochemistry of the first alcohol functional group was carried into the synthesis—through the choice of isoascorbic acid, an inexpensive and easily sourced plant-derived natural product.|$|E
25|$|Rosuvastatin has {{structural}} similarities {{with most}} other synthetic statins, e.g., <b>atorvastatin,</b> cerivastatin and pitavastatin, but unlike other statins, rosuvastatin contains sulfur (in sulfonyl functional group).|$|E
25|$|Vitamin D supplementation lowers <b>atorvastatin</b> {{and active}} {{metabolite}} concentrations, yet synergistically reduces LDL and total cholesterol concentrations. Grapefruit juice components are known inhibitors of intestinal CYP3A4.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} statins, <b>atorvastatin</b> is a {{competitive}} inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. Unlike most others, however, it {{is a completely}} synthetic compound. HMG-CoA reductase catalyzes the reduction of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) to mevalonate, which is the rate-limiting step in hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis. Inhibition of the enzyme decreases de novo cholesterol synthesis, increasing expression of low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDL receptors) on hepatocytes. This increases LDL uptake by the hepatocytes, decreasing the amount of LDL-cholesterol in the blood. Like other statins, <b>atorvastatin</b> also reduces blood levels of triglycerides and slightly increases levels of HDL-cholesterol.|$|E
25|$|For {{continuous}} outcome data, {{analysis of}} covariance (e.g., for changes in blood lipid levels after receipt of <b>atorvastatin</b> after acute coronary syndrome) tests the effects of predictor variables.|$|E
25|$|A {{comparison}} of <b>atorvastatin,</b> pravastatin and simvastatin, {{based on their}} effectiveness against placebos, found, at commonly prescribed doses, no differences among the statins in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and lipids.|$|E
25|$|In 2014 the FDA {{reported}} memory loss, forgetfulness {{and confusion}} with all statin products including <b>atorvastatin.</b> The symptoms were not serious, {{and they were}} rare and reversible on cessation of drug treatment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Atorvastatin</b> {{metabolism}} {{is primarily}} through cytochrome P450 3A4 hydroxylation to form active ortho- and parahydroxylated metabolites, {{as well as}} various beta-oxidation metabolites. The ortho- and parahydroxylated metabolites are responsible for 70% of systemic HMG-CoA reductase activity. The ortho-hydroxy metabolite undergoes further metabolism via glucuronidation. As a substrate for the CYP3A4 isozyme, it has shown susceptibility to inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 to produce increased or decreased plasma concentrations, respectively. This interaction was tested in vitro with concurrent administration of erythromycin, a known CYP3A4 isozyme inhibitor, which resulted in increased plasma concentrations of <b>atorvastatin.</b> It is also an inhibitor of cytochrome 3A4.|$|E
25|$|While many statin {{medications}} {{should be}} administered at bedtime for optimal effect, <b>atorvastatin</b> can be dosed {{at any time}} of day, {{as long as it is}} continually dosed once daily at the same time.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} {{rosuvastatin}} on LDL cholesterol are dose-related. Higher doses were more efficacious {{in improving the}} lipid profile of patients with hypercholesterolemia than milligram-equivalent doses of <b>atorvastatin</b> and milligram-equivalent or higher doses of simvastatin and pravastatin.|$|E
