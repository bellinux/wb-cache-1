50|$|In American football, <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> deflected, {{also known}} as <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> deflection, <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> defended, <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> , <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> knockdown, or <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> breakup, is <b>an</b> {{incomplete}} <b>pass</b> that {{is caused by a}} defensive player. This is done by slapping or blocking the ball with a hand or part of the arm, knocking the ball to the ground.|$|R
5|$|In {{accordance}} with recommendations {{made by the}} California's Department of Education, Rocklin Unified School District students are taught using a standards-based curriculum; each student much fulfill a set of essential skills before {{they are allowed to}} pass the class. The program is initially implemented in district elementary schools. For some classes, like English, essential skills may be demonstrated by receiving <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> grade on assigned essays or tests. In classes like mathematics, Essential Skills must be demonstrated by receiving <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> grade in specific skills on cumulative tests. In addition, WHS policy does not allow F or D grades. Any grade below a grade of C is considered a No Mark (NM) or a No Credit (NC); the class must then be repeated to get <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> grade. This plan attempts to prepare students for the California High School Exit Exam, or CAHSEE test, which they are expected to pass prior to graduation; CAHSEE is provided to students during their second year. The test covers grade 6–10 language arts concepts, as well as pre-algebraic and Algebra I mathematics.|$|E
5|$|In science class, Logan gets {{paired with}} Wallace and Dick gets paired with Angie Dahl (Kayla Ewell). Logan and Wallace perform their {{experiment}} half-heartedly, and afterwards, {{they decide to}} continue working with each other. In the end, they receive <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> grade.|$|E
5|$|The lack of <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> loop {{suitable}} for passenger trains on the Amlwch line meant that trains could only operate every two hours. Coordinating this limited timetable {{with the main}} line services through Gaerwen was difficult, and passengers could face a long wait on occasions. To make the branch line workings more flexible, <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> loop was proposed for Llangwyllog in March 1914. The work was completed for the summer timetables. This required introducing a new working section, and Llangwyllog became a staff station. As the new section {{was in the middle}} of a line, a third type of staff was required (a C configuration); one of only a few sections on the LNWR that did not use a type A or B staff.|$|E

5|$|After he is accosted by Doerachman, Mardjan {{reveals that}} the letter which Doerachman signed was {{actually}} a statement granting Mardjan all of the hadji's wealth. Furious at Mardjan's behaviour, Asmadi attacks him while Rachmat restrains the others. After a lengthy knife fight, Mardjan's foot is caught in the railroad tracks, and he is soon killed by <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> train. Doerachman, pleased {{with the return of}} his wealth, destroys the letter and grants Rachmat permission to marry Atikah.|$|E
5|$|After his {{appointment}} as project director {{for a new}} indigenous fighter program, Tank adapted the basic Ta 183 airframe for the Nene II engine, substantially resulting in a new design that bore only <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> resemblance to its forebear. The Nene was larger, heavier and {{more powerful than the}} Heinkel HeS 011 turbojet that had been planned for use in the Ta 183, and therefore required a new, redesigned fuselage with a larger cross-section primarily due to the Nene's centrifugal rather than the HeS 011's axial compressor design.|$|E
5|$|Another tale {{from the}} Devi Bhagavata Purana has <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> {{reference}} to Revanta. Once when Revanta – {{riding on the}} seven headed horse Uchaishravas – went to Vishnu's abode, Vishnu's wife goddess Lakshmi was mesmerized with the horse and ignored a question asked by the Lord. Thus, she was cursed by her husband to become a mare.|$|E
50|$|In {{the diagram}} at right, the white pawns on b5, c4, and e5 are passed pawns. Black's pawn on d4 is <b>a</b> <b>passed</b> pawn. If Black plays fxg4, then Black {{will also have}} <b>a</b> <b>passed</b> pawn on g4, and White will have <b>a</b> <b>passed</b> pawn on f4.|$|R
50|$|A pawn which {{cannot be}} blocked or {{captured}} by enemy pawns in its advance to promotion is <b>a</b> <b>passed</b> pawn. In the diagram at right, White has <b>a</b> protected <b>passed</b> pawn on c5 and Black has <b>an</b> outside <b>passed</b> pawn on h5. Because endgames are often {{won by the}} player who can promote a pawn first, having <b>a</b> <b>passed</b> pawn in <b>an</b> endgame can be decisive - especially <b>a</b> protected <b>passed</b> pawn (<b>a</b> <b>passed</b> pawn that is protected by a pawn). In this vein, a pawn majority, {{a greater number of}} pawns belonging to one player {{on one side of the}} chessboard, is strategically important because it can often be converted into <b>a</b> <b>passed</b> pawn.|$|R

5|$|Aymer Vallance was {{commissioned}} {{to produce the}} first biography of Morris, published in 1897, after Morris' death, as per the latter's wishes. This presented the creation of SPAB as Morris' greatest achievement. Morris's next biographer was Burne-Jones' son-in-law John William Mackail, who authored the two-volume Life of William Morris (1899) in which he provided a sympathetic portrayal of Morris that largely omitted his political activities, treating them as <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> phase that Morris overcame.|$|E
5|$|Banai {{does not}} appear in the Malhari Mahatmya {{originating}} from the Brahmin (high-priest caste) tradition, which glorifies Khandoba as Shiva and de-emphasizes his earthly connections. In contrast, Banai occupies the central position in the Dhangar folk narrative and Mhalsa's marriage to Khandoba is reduced to <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> mention; Marathas and other settled castes give more importance to Mhalsa.|$|E
5|$|Batygin and Brown {{suggested}} Planet Nine was a primordial giant planet core {{that was}} ejected from its initial orbit by {{an encounter with}} Jupiter during the nebular epoch of the Solar System and was later perturbed into a stable orbit by a distant encounter with <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> star or by the solar nebula. Others have proposed that it was captured {{in a similar manner}} from another star, or that it formed on a very distant circular orbit and was perturbed into its current eccentric orbit during a distant encounter with another star.|$|E
50|$|Under {{the pass}} {{system in place}} from 1885 until World War II, a Status Indian {{was not allowed to}} leave his or her Indian reserve without <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> signed by the Indian agent and could be arrested if found off reserve without <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> or with <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> that had expired.|$|R
50|$|In chess, <b>a</b> <b>passed</b> pawn is <b>a</b> pawn with no {{opposing}} pawns {{to prevent}} it from advancing to the eighth rank; i.e. there are no opposing pawns in front of it on the same file nor on an adjacent file. <b>A</b> <b>passed</b> pawn is sometimes colloquially called <b>a</b> <b>passer.</b> Passed pawns can be an advantage because only the opponent's pieces can prevent them from promoting.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{having an}} offense that {{featured}} star running back Shaun Alexander, Alabama's offensive strategy revolved around <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> offense more than a running one. During the regular season, Alabama passed for 2,435 yards but only ran for 1,272 yards. The Crimson Tide averaged 22.9 points per game, 116 rushing yards per game, and 221.4 passing yards per game.|$|E
5|$|Escapees {{aimed for}} the western (West German) shore of the Bay of Mecklenburg, a Danish {{lightship}} off the port of Gedser, the southern Danish islands of Lolland and Falster, or simply the international shipping lanes {{in the hope of}} being picked up by <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> freighter. The Baltic Sea was, however, an extremely dangerous escape route. In all, 189people are estimated to have died attempting to flee via the Baltic.|$|E

The woman was arrested and PCSO McNaught was awarded the commendation of the High Sheriff of Greater London for his brave actions. He is the first PCSO to receive the award.|$|E
5|$|In Cape Town missionaries {{were being}} accused of causing racial tension and profiteering, and after the Beagle set to sea on 18 June FitzRoy wrote {{an open letter to}} the evangelical South African Christian Recorder on the Moral State of Tahiti {{incorporating}} extracts from both his and Darwin's diaries to defend the reputation of missionaries. This was given to <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> ship which took it to Cape Town to become FitzRoy's (and Darwin's) first published work.|$|E

25|$|Netball {{strategy}} involves {{several types}} of passes, including centre passes, penalty passes and short <b>passes.</b> <b>A</b> centre <b>pass</b> occurs after <b>a</b> goal has been scored, when the Centre <b>passes</b> the ball. <b>A</b> short <b>pass</b> is <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> between two players on the same team, where {{the length of the}} pass is so short that a defensive player cannot get between the two opposing players to intercept the ball. <b>A</b> penalty <b>pass</b> is <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> where the ball is returned from the sideline into play.
