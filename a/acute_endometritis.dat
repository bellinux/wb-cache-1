50|$|<b>Acute</b> <b>Endometritis</b> is {{characterized}} by infection. The organisms most often isolated {{are believed to be}} because of compromised abortions, delivery, medical instrumentation, and retention of placental fragments. There is not enough evidence for the use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent endometritis after manual removal of placental in vaginal birth. Histologically, neutrophilic infiltration of the endometrial tissue is present during <b>acute</b> <b>endometritis.</b> The clinical presentation is typically high fever and purulent vaginal discharge. Menstruation after <b>acute</b> <b>endometritis</b> is excessive and in uncomplicated cases can resolve after 2 weeks of clindamycin and gentamicin IV antibiotic treatment.|$|E
5000|$|Taylorella equigenitalis is {{susceptible}} to most antibiotics, although the carrier state in mares is difficult to eliminate. Most mares with <b>acute</b> <b>endometritis</b> recover spontaneously. Recommended therapy is to infuse the uterus with an antibiotic such as penicillin, cleansing the clitoral area with 2% chlorhexidine solution and then applying chlorhexidine or nitrofurazone ointment to the clitoral fossa and sinuses. The entire treatment is repeated daily for five days.|$|E
50|$|Pathologists have {{traditionally}} classified endometritis as either acute or chronic: <b>acute</b> <b>endometritis</b> {{is characterized by}} the presence of microabscesses or neutrophils within the endometrial glands, while chronic endometritis is distinguished by variable numbers of plasma cells within the endometrial stroma. The most common cause of endometritis is infection. Symptoms include lower abdominal pain, fever and abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge. Caesarean section, prolonged rupture of membranes and long labor with multiple vaginal examinations are important risk factors. Treatment is usually with broad-spectrum antibiotics.|$|E
40|$|A {{field survey}} {{for the study}} of {{bacterial}} diseases of the reproductive system of camels in Eastern Sudan was conducted. The important diseases of she-camels were <b>acute</b> catarrhal <b>endometritis,</b> pyometra, chronic <b>endometritis</b> and <b>acute</b> or chronic mastitis. The incidence of these diseases increased with age and reached its peak in autumn. Isolated bacteria included Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Corynebacterium spp., Proteus spp., Salmonella spp. and Streptococcus spp. Although trials to isolate Brucella spp., were negative, high agglutinating titres were detected. Male camels had orchitis which was due to Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli and Proteus spp. These organisms in addition to Corynebacterium spp. and Clostridium spp., were isolated from wounds of the external genitalia. Incidence of orchitis and wounds of external genitalia was also increased with age in autumn...|$|R
40|$|Green {{leaves of}} Tetrapterys multiglandulosa A. Juss were fed to {{pregnant}} goats from day 35 of pregnancy. Five goats received 10 g/kgBW (group I), five received 20 g/kgBW (group II) and five {{were used as}} control (group III), and received only hay, fresh grass and commercial ration. All animals were clinically examined daily and submitted to ultrasonography every three days. Fetal death and vulvar catarrhal discharge with subsequent abortion were observed {{at the end of}} the second month of pregnancy in group II and at the third month of pregnancy in group I. Animals from groups I and II were slaughtered after abortion and necropsied. Goats from the control group were necropsied at the same time. The main lesions in the aborted goats were focal placentitis with early involution (apoptosis) and placentary coagulation necrosis, <b>acute</b> focal <b>endometritis</b> and vulvo-vaginal petechiae. All aborted fetuses were underdeveloped when compared to control fetuses, probably due to fetal malnutrition, since no congenital malformations could be noted. The majority of aborted fetuses showed some degree of autolysis, as fetal death occurred five and three days before abortion, in groups I and II, respectively. The most remarkable fetal lesions were focal or diffuse hemorrhages in the skin, meninges and visceral serosae...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Melengestrol acetate (MGA) {{contraceptives}} {{are widely}} used in zoo felids to regulate fertility and may have deleterious effects on endometrial health. To determine whether MGA exposure was associated with endometrial disease, the genital tracts of 212 zoo felids (99 MGA treated and 113 control) representing 23 species were evaluated. Adenomatous and cystic hyperplasia were prevalent in both MGA-treated (85 %) and control (61 %) groups, {{and the risk of}} developing these lesions increased with age. Treatment with MGA further increased the risk of developing advanced hyperplasia regardless of dose, and treatment for 72 months sig-nificantly elevated that risk, whereas parous animals had a lower risk. Endometrial polyps, fibrosis, adenomyosis, and hydrometra occurred in both MGA-treated and control animals. MGA treatment was associated with an increased risk of hydrometra and mineralization but not of adenomyosis, polyps, or fibrosis after adjusting for advanced hyperplasia. <b>Acute</b> or chronic <b>endometritis</b> were associated with advanced hyperplasia but not with MGA treatment. These results indicate that proliferative and inflammatory endometrial lesions are common spontaneous diseases in zoo cats, and MGA contraceptives increase the risk of some diseases. The association of MGA with endometrial lesions that could impair fertility should be considered when using this contraceptive in genetically valuable felids.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of induced endometritis on uterine blood flow in cows. Transrectal Doppler sonography was performed on uterine arteries of six cyclic cows before and for 4 days after inducing <b>acute</b> <b>endometritis</b> by intrauterine infusion of 720 mg of policresulen, and for 4 days of the following estrous cycle. Time-averaged maximum velocity (TAMV) increased (p 0. 05) in the next 4 days of the same cycle. TAMV and PI values in the subsequent cycle did not differ (p > 0. 05) from the values measured before infusion and showed no changes (p > 0. 05) within the cycle. Blood flow parameters were not related (p > 0. 05) to plasma concentrations of progesterone and estrogen. All cows showed an <b>acute</b> <b>endometritis</b> determined by histopathological findings of biopsy samples taken 1 day after infusion and fibrotic endometrial alterations detected in the subsequent cycle. No relationships were observed between fibrotic changes of the endometrium and uterine blood flow during either cycle. In conclusion, acute inflammation is accompanied by a rise in uterine blood flow, but fibrotic alterations {{do not seem to be}} related to Doppler sonographic findings...|$|E
30|$|Theoretically, UAE may {{contribute}} to difficulties in embryo implantation or maintenance of pregnancy by decreasing vascularity of the uterine myometrium and endometrium. In fact, embolization particles have been identified after UAE in structures adjacent to leiomyomas (myometrium, parametrium, mesovarium) [14]. Most often, myometrium adjacent to embolized leiomyomas is spared from tissue necrosis. In addition, there generally {{does not seem to}} be any significant histologic impact on the endometrium, presumably because myometrial vessels trap particles before arrival in the endometrium. Colgan and colleagues [15] reported cervical necrosis, necrotizing myometritis, endomyometritis, or <b>acute</b> <b>endometritis</b> in five of eight hysterectomy specimens that were performed for complications after 555 UAE procedures. Therefore, although the overall risk seems to be low, there is a concern that UAE could produce a deleterious impact on myometrium and endometrium.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Of 100 uteri of ewes {{collected}} from a slaughterhouse, 44 had endometritis. These cases {{were classified as}} <b>acute</b> <b>endometritis</b> (18 %), acute lymphocytic endometritis (59 %), chronic non-suppurative endometritis (16 %) and suppurative endometritis (6. 8 %). Aerobic bacteria were isolated from 26 uteri. The most commonly isolated bacteria were Escherichiu coli, Corynebacterium pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. These organisms then were inoc-ulated into the uteri of normal ewes. None of the inoculated bacteria consistently produced any particular type of endometrial lesion. Bacterial organisms {{are considered to be}} the predominant cause of endometritis. Parasites, viruses, mycoplasma and mycotic agents, however, should not be excluded. Corynebacterium pyogenes, Escherichia coli and streptococci are the organisms com-monly isolated from the uteri of ewes [l], and E. coli and streptococci appear to be the organisms commonly associated with endometritis. The presence of bacteria as normal inhabitants in the uterus has been recorded [6, 12, 131. These normal inhabitants may behave as pathogens in the presence of several factors [3]. The uterus is said to be more resistant to the invasion of bacterial organisms when it i...|$|E

40|$|Six {{pregnant}} Standardbred mares aged between 6 and 14 {{years were}} gavaged with 50 g or 100 g of suspended emulsified whole Processionary caterpillars (Ochrogaster lunifer) for 5 days during 2 experiments undertaken {{to study the}} etiology of equine amnionitis and fetal loss (EAFL). The 6 treated mares and 1 untreated mare were between 128 and 252 days gestation. Mare 1 (untreated) was euthanized on day 5 of the treatment period, while the treated mares were euthanized on days 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, and 24 days from their first treatment. Caterpillar setae were {{not found in the}} untreated mare. Setal fragments were present in all regions of the gastrointestinal tracts in all treated mares, the uteri and mesenteric lymph nodes of 5 mares, and the liver of 4 mares. Acute gastroenteritis of varying severity was present in all treated mares, and 5 of 6 mares had <b>acute</b> colitis and <b>endometritis.</b> Focal hyperplastic serositis was found in the duodenum, cecum, dorsal colon, and uteri of various mares occasionally with embedded setal fragments. Setal invasion of the mucosa evoked a range of lesions including superficial erosion to deep ulceration. Inflammation in deeper tissues ranged from unapparent to neutrophilic (microabscesses), eosinophilic, or mononuclear (microgranulomas). The finding of setal fragments within the uterus of experimental mares suggests that direct migration of setal fragments acting as a bacterial vector is a likely mechanism for the bacterial abortions that characterize equine amnionitis and fetal loss...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Parasite-host {{relationships}} {{can cause}} diminished or absent ability to conceive, ectopic pregnancy or pregnancy with undesired course. Literature review There {{are reports that}} some protozoa, helminths and fungi may impair women's reproductive capacity, causing deformites of genital tract, so that conception is impossible, or, if it does occur, normal implantation and development of placenta are impossible. Schistosoma haematobium may cause vulvar papule, swelling, tumors, irregular vaginal hemorrhage, tubular infertility and ectopic pregnancies. Patients with cirrhosis caused by schistosomas have gonadal dysfunction and schistosomiasis itself can lead to tubular infertility. Some authors found microfilaria of Mansonella perstans in folicular aspirates in patients with tubular adhesions. Chronic Entamoeba histolytica infection can cause pelvic pain and dyspareunia in some patients. Although Trichomonas vaginalis is a common cause of tubal inflammation, this protozoa affects semen quality and leads to secondary infertility. Soluble parasite extract of T. vaginalis can lead to impaired motility of 50 % spermatozoa in vitro and affects semen quality by increased viscosity and amount of debris, or damage spermatozoid membrane. In enterobiosis, presence of adult worms and eggs in fallopian tube, can be followed by chronic salpingitis and tubal occlusion. Also in ascariosis, presence of adult forms and eggs can lead to <b>acute</b> colpitis, chronic <b>endometritis,</b> salpingitis or ovarian abscess. The concequence of fungal infections, such as colpitis and endometritis, caused by Candida albicans, may be infertility. Also, according to some reports, C. albicans leads to decreased spermatozoan motility. Conclusion Hence parasites and fungi can cause infertility, we recommend examination of both partners in treatment of infertility...|$|R
40|$|IN METRORRHAGIA Endometrium is {{a tissue}} {{which is in}} permament changes in the active {{gynecological}} period of a female. This can be followed-up through histological, custological and histochemical changes. In determing the morphologic changes and disturbances in endometrium, pathohistological examinations were and still are necessary and irreplaceable in defining the real causes of this phenomenon. The aim of our work is to show the pathohistological results of the material obtained by explorative curettage in metrorrhagia, to determine the aetiology of the pathological process in endometrium, which provokes irregular bleeding, and to check the possible increase in precancerogenic and malignant endometrial conditions {{over a period of}} three years. The examinations covered 786 patients who asserted that bleeding was the main symptom of their illness. In all of them explorative curettage was performed mainly in diagnostic and often in therapeutic purposes. The number of examinations are in constant increase. The age of the largest number of patiens was from 41 to 50 years, a period when the anovulary cycle is most frequent which, in turn, causes changes in endometrium which results in irregular bleeding i. e. in metrorrhagia (Tables 1, 2 and 3). The most frequent histopathological changes were manifested by adenomatic hyperplasia (160), then glandular (136) and cystic hyperplasia (92). Eleven cases of endometrial carcinoma were detected. In two of these patients the finding was not confirmed by pathohistological result after the operation or repeated explorative curretage. In 64 patients atypical hyperplasia i. e. Ca in situ was found. <b>Acute</b> <b>endometritis</b> followed by irregular bleeding was observed during inflammatory process of the internal genital organs. In 35 patients chronic endometritis was found after curettage following the extraction of the intrauterine device (in one case after 40 years of carrying). In 103 patients with hyperplasia myomatous changes were noted; this finding correlated with hyperoestrogenism, which is usually present in both disorders. All authors agree that pathohistological examination of endometrium is the most relayable in the search for a correct diagnosis. Despite of all modern diagnostic and technical means, difficulties always arise in the assessment of malignant potential of endometrial hyperplasia. Therefore, the patients with recurrent bleeding caused by hyperplasia should be under intensive gynaecological control...|$|E
40|$|Endometritis is {{the most}} {{important}} cause of infertility in barren mares. The quick method of endometrial cytology (EC) has a relatively high reliability in diagnosing endometrial inflammation in the mare. For reliable cytological results, a collection technique that yields many well-preserved cells representative of a large uterine surface area without causing harm to the reproductive tract is required. The aim {{of the study was to}} compare three usually employed techniques for collection of endometrial and inflammatory cells (guarded cotton swab, uterine lavage, and cytobrush) in chronically infertile mares. Twenty Standardbred mares were used. In each mare, samples for EC were collected, first by a cotton swab (DGS), then by a cytobrush (CB), and finally by low volume flush (LVF). The slides were stained using the Diff Quick stain. The following parameters were assessed for each tested technique: background content of the slides; quality of the cells harvested; total cellularity; neutrophils; ratio PMN/uterine epithelial cells; inflammatory cells; vaginal epithelium cells. Categorical variables were compared using contingency tables and Pearson Chi-square tests, whereas continuous variables were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA); P< 0. 05 was considered significant. Samplings by DGS and CB resulted easy and quick to perform via a single operator in all cases. LVF was performed easily, but required the presence of 2 – 3 players and took more time. The background content of the slides prepared by DGS appeared proteinaceous, slides prepared by LVF appeared contaminated by red blood cells or debris, whereas slides prepared by CB appeared clear. All smears showed a good total cellularity. The CB yielded significantly more cells (P < 0. 0001) than DGS and LVF. The DGS produced significant more cells than LVF (P< 0. 0001). The DGS produced significantly more (P= 0. 003) intact cells than CB and LVF. Distorted cells were significantly (P= 0. 001) more frequent in smears by LVF. The CB harvested significantly (P= 0. 009) more fragmented cells. CB and LVF produced significantly (P< 0. 0001; P= 0. 02) more PMNs/HPF than DGS. In smears collected by LVF the proportion of PMNs/uterine epithelial cells was significantly (P= 0. 0062; P= 0. 0023) higher than in smears by CB and DGS. CB collected a significantly higher (P= 0. 0011) proportion of PMNs than DGS. <b>Acute</b> <b>endometritis</b> was diagnosed in 50...|$|E
40|$|Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (S. zooepidemicus) is an {{opportunistic}} pathogen {{of several}} species including humans. S. zooepidemicus is found on mucus membranes of healthy horses, but can cause <b>acute</b> and chronic <b>endometritis.</b> Recently S. zooepidemicus was found able {{to reside in}} the endometrium for prolonged periods of time. Thus, we hypothesized that an intracellular phase {{may be part of}} the S. zooepidemicus pathogenesis and investigated if S. zooepidemicus was able to invade and survive inside epithelial cells. HEp- 2 and HeLa cell lines were co-cultured with two S. zooepidemicus strains (1 - 4 a and S 31 A 1) both originating from the uterus of mares suffering from endometritis. Cells were fixed at different time points during the 23 h infection assay and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was used to characterize adhesion and invasion mechanisms. The FESEM images showed three morphologically different types of invasion for both bacterial strains. The main port of entry was through large invaginations in the epithelial cell membrane. Pili-like bacterial appendages were observed when the S. zooepidemicus cells were in close proximity to the epithelial cells indicating that attachment and invasion were active processes. Adherent and intracellular S. zooepidemicus, and bacteria in association with lysosomes was determined by immunofluorescence staining techniques and fluorescence microscopy. Quantification of intracellular bacteria was determined in penicillin protection assays. Both S. zooepidemicus strains investigated were able to invade epithelial cells although at different magnitudes. The immunofluorescence data showed significantly higher adhesion and invasion rates for strain 1 - 4 a when compared to strain S 31 A 1. S. zooepidemicus was able to survive intracellularly, but the survival rate decreased over time in the cell culture system. Phagosome-like compartments containing S. zooepidemicus at some stages fused with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome. The results indicate that an intracellular phase may be one way S. zooepidemicus survives in the host, and could in part explain how S. zooepidemicus can cause recurrent/persistent infections. Future studies should reveal the ability of S. zooepidemicus to internalize and survive in primary equine endometrial cells and during in vivo conditions...|$|R
40|$|Objective : {{to develop}} a {{technology}} for obtaining the molded sorbent VNIITU 1, to study its physicochemical and biomedical properties, and to evaluate its efficacy in preventing and treating pyoinflammatory complications in obstetrics. Materials and methods.   The molded sorbent VNIITU- 1 was designed from the carbon porous material based on nanodispersed carbon by mixing with a vehicle, extruding the mixture, drying the extrudate in an inert atmosphere, thermally treating and activating by steam, followed by washing with distilled water and drying (TU 9398043710698342013). The molded sorbent VNIITU- 1 is apyrogenic and nontoxic (Toxicity Study Conclusion No. 1998. 013. P dated 14. 08. 2013; Engineering Testing Assessment No. 12. 404 ORTI/ 2013 dated  26. 08. 2013), it is destined for single administration, sterile, placed in a removable thread capron mesh container, and used to treat and prevent pyoseptic complications in puerperas at risk for infection, such as <b>acute</b> nonspecific postpartum <b>endometritis.</b> A total of  52 puerperas were examined and treated. They had been divided into 2 groups: a study group (n= 37) and a comparison group (n= 15). In the study group, the hemosorbent VNIITU 1 as a porous carbon applicator was postpartum inserted into the uterine cavity, by concurrently performing traditional antibiotic therapy to prevent infectious complications. The comparison group received only traditional antibiotic therapy. The uterine cavity aspirate was examined for IL 1 β and IL 6 levels, its microbial profile, and microbial growth patterns in culture media. The data were processed using a package of applied STATISTICA 6. 1 programs and standard mathematical tables in Microsoft Excel. Descriptive and variation statistical methods were applied. The data were presented as Me [low quartilehigh quartile (LQHQ) ]; two pre and posttreatment dependent variables were compared using the Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney tests. Results. The molded carbon sorbent VNIITU 1 {{was found to have}} pronounced antibacterial activity against S. aureus, P. aeroginosa, K. pneumonia, E. coli and S. agalactiae. Examination of lavages {{from the surface of the}} sorbent after its removal from the uterine cavity, by using a transmission electron microscope, revealed castoff epithelial cells, leukocytes, macrophages, and microorganisms, which determines the capacity of the sorbent to eliminate not only soluble toxins, but also microorganisms and disintegrating cell elements. Conclusion. The proposed procedure to  postpartum endometritis in puer peras at risk for infection via insertion of the porous carbon applicator VNIITU 1 into the uterine cavity is more effective than the traditional approach and it can improve treatment results, by completely eliminating pathogens from the uterus and by reducing the level of local proinflammatory cytokines. </p...|$|R
