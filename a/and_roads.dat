5|$|After {{surveying}} flooding {{from the}} depression in Florida, Governor Reubin Askew {{asked for a}} disaster declaration. President of the United States Gerald Ford declared Bay, Gulf, Holmes, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa, Wakulla, Walton, and Washington counties a disaster area. The declaration allowed low-interest loans to become available for repairs to small businesses and granted money to city and county governments to rebuild damaged buildings, bridges, <b>and</b> <b>roads.</b> Funds were also given to aid restoration of flooded farmland and damaged crops.|$|E

5|$|At Banagher, {{there are}} ridges {{on both sides}} of the river <b>and</b> <b>roads</b> were built along these many centuries ago. The first bridge was built over the Shannon at that point as early as 1049. It was a place of great {{strategic}} importance because the Shannon and its lowlands provided a natural barrier between Connacht and Leinster. An army that wanted to cross the river had few choices; apart from Banagher, the only other suitable places were Athlone, Shannonbridge and Portumna.|$|E
40|$|Travelling in India by road is {{considered}} dangerous as traffic conditions are chaotic, the drivers drive recklessly, <b>and</b> the <b>roads</b> are poorly maintained. Therefore, there is need to monitor driver behavior <b>and</b> <b>road</b> condition regularly. In this work, {{we developed a}} method that collects data using accelerometer sensor present in Smartphone and analyze driving events <b>and</b> <b>road</b> anomalies. This paper presents the patterns of driving events, such as left turn, right turn, sudden braking and sudden forward acceleration, <b>and</b> <b>road</b> conditions, such as pothole, bump and rough patch, detected in the data set. This work will help in analyzing driving behavior <b>and</b> <b>road</b> anomalies to ensure driver safety <b>and</b> maintenance of <b>roads...</b>|$|R
