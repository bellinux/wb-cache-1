25|$|On 10 January 1864, Alexandra {{gave birth}} to a second son and last child, Grand Duke Peter Nikolaevich of Russia. The {{following}} year, Alexandra became chairwoman {{of the board of trustees}} of the office of Empress Maria Alexandrovna which oversaw orphanages, founding homes, schools and hospitals. The area of medicine and nursing had a particular appeal to Alexandra, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>she</b> nursed the patients herself. In 1865, Alexandra founded a training institute for nurses in St Petersburg, the Pokrov of our lady commune. In spite of the differences in character and outlook, Alexandra and her husband lived in harmony for the first ten years of their married life. Initially, Grand Duke Nicholas respected and admired his wife's interest in charities and medicine as well as her being extremely religious. He financed a hospital in the city where her theories could be developed and put into practice and poor patients received care without charge.|$|E
500|$|The video {{features}} Madonna in {{a stylized}} recording studio singing the song with back up singers. The video {{was compared to}} the music video of Madonna's single [...] "Rain" [...] (1993). Her look in the video, consists of blue-black icy hair, bright blue eyes and a long dark dress with a beaded necklace around her neck. Madonna's face was mainly shot above her head, with her face looking up {{just ahead of the}} camera focus. Sometimes she looks to a video screen behind her which plays the scenes from the film, as if to take inspiration for her singing. Other times she is accompanied by her back-up singers, mainly during the chorus, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>she</b> sings alone. In front of the studio, the producers are shown deciding which part of the song should be put in lower bass.|$|E

500|$|The primary {{characters}} in The Other Hand are Little Bee, a Nigerian refugee, and Sarah, a middle-class Englishwoman. Critics {{have focused on}} the contrast between the two, with Caroline Elkins of The New York Times commenting that Sarah might initially appear [...] "insipid" [...] to readers, and that when juxtaposed with Little Bee, she seems [...] "unsympathetic, even tiresome". Tim Teeman of The Times deemed Sarah [...] "batty, bizarre and inconsistent, and despite the tragedy she has suffered, unsympathetic", while writing that in contrast: [...] "Goodness peppers every atom of [...] being." [...] Other reviewers took an opposite stance. Margot Kaminski of the San Francisco Chronicle found Little Bee's characterisation problematic, writing: [...] "Sometimes she's not convincing, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>she</b> tries too hard to convince. It's too often apparent that Little Bee is not real. This doesn't do justice to her story, and puts the burden back on the author to show that he's representing her, rather than exploiting her." [...] Ed Lake of The Daily Telegraph felt that [...] "Bee's arch reasonableness and implausibly picturesque speech mean she often comes off as a too-cute cipher", and ultimately found Sarah the more convincing character.|$|E
2500|$|In 1959, Paige's {{mother told}} a {{reporter}} that he was 55 rather than 53, saying she knew this because she wrote it down in her Bible. Paige wrote in his autobiography, [...] "Seems like Mom's Bible would know, but she ain't ever shown me the Bible. Anyway, {{she was in her}} nineties when she told the reporter that, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>she</b> tended to forget things." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the People's Republic after 1949, {{the image}} of the Manchu Empress was debated and changed several times. She was {{sometimes}} praised for her anti-imperialist role in the Boxer Uprising <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>she</b> was reviled {{as a member of the}} [...] "feudalist regime". When Mao Zedong's wife, Jiang Qing was arrested in 1976 for abuse of power, an exhibit at the Palace Museum put Cixi's luxurious goods on display to show that a female ruler weakened the nation.|$|E

2500|$|Long ago, the {{expected}} {{date of delivery}} was determined by taking the phase of the moon into consideration. [...] A delivery during a full moon was considered dangerous to {{the child and the}} mother. The arrival of the midwife at the home of the expectant mother varied. [...] Sometimes the family would call the midwife when the labor started <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>she</b> would arrive at the home {{a few days before the}} anticipated birth. [...] This was probably dependent on the proximity of the midwife to the woman’s house. [...] The midwife and her assistant would assist with chores around the house if they were able to arrive early.|$|E
2500|$|Between January 1999 and March 2004, Rau was hospitalised {{several more}} times after further {{incidents}} of unstable behaviour. On several occasions, she disappeared {{for a few}} days, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>she</b> travelled overseas, but she had always returned or made contact with her family, usually with her sister, Chris Rau. On 1 December 2003, Rau disappeared, and was reported missing to the police by her family; however, she soon returned. Rau was prescribed medication for her condition and was often re-admitted to hospital, {{but she did not}} like to take treatment because she disliked the side effects. [...] Eventually Rau's doctors and her family scheduled a community treatment order hearing for 18 March 2004, which would have compelled Rau to take her medication.|$|E

She's a poor old thing; been here ever so long; lost {{her husband and her}} children; it's bad to be left like that, all alone.

60|$|Ann Veronica Stanley was twenty-one and a {{half years}} old. She had black hair, fine eyebrows, and a clear complexion; and the forces that had {{modelled}} her features had loved and lingered at their work and made them subtle and fine. She was slender, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>she</b> seemed tall, and walked and carried herself lightly and joyfully as one who commonly and habitually feels well, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>she</b> stooped a little and was preoccupied. Her lips came together with an expression between contentment and the faintest shadow of a smile, her manner was one of quiet reserve, and behind this mask she was wildly discontented and eager for freedom and life.|$|E
60|$|Hendrika grunted assent. I {{am sorry}} that I cannot express her method of speech by any more polite term. Sometimes she grunted like a monkey, {{sometimes}} she clicked like a Bushman, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>she</b> did both together, {{when she became}} quite unintelligible.|$|E
