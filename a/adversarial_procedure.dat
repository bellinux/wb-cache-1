40|$|This {{article is}} written from the {{perspective}} of a court president in The Netherlands, a so called civil law country. In theory, in a civil law country, judges and lawyers in civil and commercial cases base their actions on the application of the law and its interpretation. Moreover, in criminal matters, the courts use inquisitorial procedures which differ from the <b>adversarial</b> <b>procedures</b> used in common law countries. The field of court management is not highly developed because of the tension between the need for judicial independence and judicial organization. There are many examples of this tension, including the fact that courts may be subject to budgetary limits which themselves may intrude upon judicial independence. For instance, suppose that a judge believes it necessary to appoint an expert to answer a certain scientific question, but the expert is expensive and budgetary considerations preclude the appointment. When I was involved in the process of the budgets of prosecutors’ offices and courts, this question frequently arose. In an effort to deal with this problem, part of the courts’ budgets were treated as open-ended even though courts rarely spent these open-ended budgets lavishly. </span...|$|R
40|$|Settlements are an {{important}} part of a program of cartel deterrence, particularly when the likelihood of conviction and the litigation costs are higher. This type of negotiated procedure to reach finality is in essence complementary to the fully <b>adversarial</b> <b>procedures</b> associated to the trial by the administrative or judicial courts, and to other investigative instruments, such as the leniency agreement. The Brazilian experience provides some insights about the different models of direct settlement in cartel cases and the complex interaction among settlements, leniency agreements, and trial outcome. First, there is leeway for the complementary models of settlements, the first oriented mainly to increasing the likelihood of detection, and the second oriented to saving social costs of litigation. Second, the concern with the preservation of the demand for leniency agreements led the competition authority to restrict the use of settlements, which are effectively designed for the defendants that are likely guilty and give higher value to finality. The recent experience illustrates that the current settlement policy has not caused any adverse effect on leniency agreements, while reducing litigation costs and granting finality in some cases...|$|R

Is a lawyer morally permitted, for example, to destroy the character of an innocent witness through ruthless cross-examination or to withhold information, unknown to the authorities, regarding his client 2 ̆ 7 s participation in past crimes? A lawyer {{has a duty to}} advance the interests of his clients with maximum effectiveness, within the limits of the law, and to do this must often perform actions that from a moral point of view may seem dubious or even indefensible. Whether, despite the appearance of impropriety, these actions are in fact morally allowable is generally assumed to be the central question of legal ethics. Most affirmative answers to this question appeal to the advantages of an adversarial system of adjudication and attempt to show that various actions that would indeed be objectionable if performed outside the context of such a system must be encouraged, or at a minimum allowed, if the advantages of the system as a whole are to be secured. Arguments of this sort lead, in turn, to the further question of whether <b>adversarial</b> <b>procedures</b> are themselves morally acceptable, a question that grows directly from our doubts about the permissibility of the more specific things that lawyers do.

40|$|Can juries handle complex cases? One way {{to frame}} this {{question}} in behavioral science terms is to ask: What tasks can juries perform well and what tasks will they perform poorly? Our basic precept is that the legal system should ask juries to perform tasks that they are good at performing and should not require juries to carry out tasks that they cannot perform well. A second guiding theme in our approach {{to the issue of}} jury competency is that the most relevant, most useful analyses of jury performance are based on empirical observations and data, not on rational analyses of hypothetical ideal situations [...] . Our assumption is that it is reasonable to conceive of some jury decisions as serving the function of controlling risky behavior. Thus, for example, when a jury is asked to consider exemplary or punitive damages to punish and deter members of society from engaging in conduct that is in reckless disregard of the risks to others, we view the judgment as involving social risk management. Thus we ask: Can the jury perform in a manner so that it serves as an effective societal risk manager? To avoid any pretense of suspense, we believe that this is an extremely difficult function that is often not performed effectively even by the best informed experts. The jury is ill-informed and poorly equipped to perform this function. In our view, effective risk identification and management often requires the application of technical, statistical, and scientific analytic tools that cannot be effectively communicated to the unschooled layperson through expert testimony in <b>adversarial</b> <b>procedures...</b>|$|R

Recently, scholars of comparative law and public policy have asked whether this American legal style is spreading around the world. Some scholars have argued that legal styles are converging on an American model, while others have argued that distinctive national legal styles will persist. This article addresses this emerging debate. We argue that American legal style is spreading to other jurisdictions. However, we depart from predominant explanations, which attribute convergence to international regulatory competition or emulation. Instead, we argue that economic liberalization and political fragmentation have undermined traditional approaches to regulation and have generated functional pressures and political incentives to shift toward American legal style.

The findings indicate that arbitration practitioner's perceptions of the factors influencing the achievement of settlement as well as specific barriers to settlement demonstrate a high degree of convergence across regions.

40|$|This paper {{traces the}} {{development}} of administrative tribunals in the UK, from the modern phase of their development {{in the second half}} of the 19 th century, via some constitutional controversies in the first half of the 20 th century, to the radical overhaul of the tribunal system that has been taking place in the last few years – in parallel (so far as recent developments are concerned) with other major reforms of the machinery of justice. The story is one of a fairly steady movement towards an increasing formalisation and judicialisation of the tribunal system. In this context ‘judicialisation’ means that tribunals have become more and more like ordinary courts, adopting formal and increasingly <b>adversarial</b> <b>procedures</b> (thereby perhaps making life harder for unrepresented appellants, the traditional core-users of the system). We will consider whether this tendency is, on balance, a good thing. We will also need to reflect on whether – recent reforms notwithstanding – the word ‘system’ is strictly apposite in this context, given the piecemeal development and continuing diversity of tribunals; and whether use of the adjective ‘administrative’ may beg too many questions about the nature and raison d’être of tribunals (hence the inverted commas round the word in the title of this article). Sometimes the more neutral adjectives, ‘special’ or ‘specialist’ have been used. Important landmarks in the history of tribunals have been the reports of three major official inquiries – the Donoughmore Report, (Donoughmore, 1932), the Franks Report, (Franks, 1957) and the Leggatt Review, (Leggatt, 2001). The terms of reference of these inquiries, discussed in the body of the article, can be found in Appendix 1. Appendix 2 lists some of the main administrative tribunals that were under the supervision of the (former) Council on Tribunals 1 in the mid- 1990 s, before the changes set in motion by the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. Appendix 3 gives a snapshot of the (still evolving) reformed tribunal system, following the coming into force of the 2007 Act. 1 On 1 November 2007 the Council on Tribunals was replaced by the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council, established by the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.
