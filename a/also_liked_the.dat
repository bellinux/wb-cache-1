5|$|Gervais' {{performance}} has been praised by critics, being listed {{as one of}} the best guest appearances on The Simpsons by writers for Entertainment Weekly and The Times. Groening <b>also</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> performance and invited Gervais to appear on the show again. The episode as a whole, however, received mixed reviews from critics. A live-action remake of the regular animated opening sequence of The Simpsons aired at the beginning of the episode.|$|E
5|$|At the time, prison-based {{films were}} not {{considered}} likely box office successes, but Darabont's script was read by then-Castle Rock Entertainment producer Liz Glotzer, whose interest in prison stories, and reaction to the script, led her to threaten to quit if Castle Rock did not produce The Shawshank Redemption. Director and Castle Rock co-founder Rob Reiner <b>also</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> script. He offered Darabont between $2.4 million and $3 million {{to allow him to}} direct it himself. Reiner, who had previously adapted King's novella The Body into the 1986 film Stand by Me, planned to cast Tom Cruise as Andy and Harrison Ford as Red.|$|E
5|$|Items {{from the}} TV series such as multi-perspective screens (as {{shown on the}} box cover) were popular for {{illustrating}} multiple viewpoints of an objective. The use of episode start and end graphics to mark the start and end of missions was <b>also</b> <b>liked.</b> <b>The</b> script was generally described as being a redeeming feature of the game, although fans of the series may find that the viewpoints, motives and reasoning of the villains isn't covered well. Cutscenes were singled out for particular praise by IGN, highlighting good use of camera angles and tight focus. Voice acting was generally popular, although some lines suffered from poor direction or emphasis. In contrast, device and ambiance sounds were well received with gunfire getting a particular mention.|$|E

5|$|Molyneux was {{impressed}} with the creature's navigation code: he stated that it is the largest piece of code, and that players could change the map repeatedly and creatures will still find routes to their destinations. Molyneux <b>also</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> fact that the game adapts to the player, enabling the choice of the preferred methods and strategies, and stated that his favourite part of the game is how the player digs out rather than build up, meaning the player has heavy involvement in building the level. He stated that he was proud of Dungeon Keepers concept, but remarked that doing original things takes time. He also liked that people were unable to describe Dungeon Keeper in any particular way. Molyneux disliked the user interface, saying the team overdid the control panel, and commented that it was a reminder that the player was playing a video game. This was a key reason the user interface of his next video game, Black & White, did not feature panels, buttons, or icons.|$|E
25|$|Throughout production, CBS {{executives}} {{objected to}} the violent nature of the episode. They asked Guggenheim to make it less violent, but Guggenheim refused when possible. The executives also {{expressed concern about the}} overall plot of the episode. They felt that it would be too early in the series to show Charlie's emotional reaction to the violence. The executives expressed concern about Charlie's emotional state during a scene set in the Eppes family garage where Charlie recalled the violence. Heuton and Falacci agreed to remove the scene as they felt that the scene did not suit the plot. Citing the convention that the protagonist in a crime drama does not lose his or her gun, the network executives also felt that the loss of Don's gun was inappropriate for the series. Heuton and Falacci insisted on keeping it in the script, and series regular Rob Morrow <b>also</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> idea of Don losing his gun. Heuton and Falacci assured the executives that Don would have an emotional reward {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|E
500|$|Alana de la Garza {{was cast}} as NYPD Detective Jo Martinez. [...] The show's {{procedural}} aspect, the series' serialized nature, and the believability {{of the world}} interested de la Garza. [...] She <b>also</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> idea that, in contrast to de la Garza's characters on other procedurals, Jo had flaws.|$|E
50|$|A critic from Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} book an A minus saying fans of Brands first book will <b>also</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> sequel.|$|R

500|$|Moriarty lauded the game's {{depiction}} of Hong Kong as [...] "alive and well-populated" [...] and <b>also</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> AI, the setting, {{and the voice}} acting, in particular the use of Cantonese and English. Edge gave similar praise: [...] "Offering a view of Asia through the filter of its action film industry, this is a {{depiction of}} Hong Kong that could have come straight from the reel." [...] Pinsof acclaimed the city's scale and AI.|$|E
500|$|Nitsuh Abebe from AllMusic {{positively}} {{reviewed the}} track (and Lately), claiming that [...] "I Hate December" [...] {{and the four}} other tracks allow [...] "their dreamier elements [...] come straight from the group's songwriting"; he <b>also</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> production, describing it as [...] "delicate" [...] and [...] "gentle". Indi from Canadian Atheist remarked that the single is [...] "lovely" [...] and applauded Ivy for disobeying the rules of a traditional holiday song. Longtime friend and collaborator D'arcy Wretzky labeled the track as her [...] "favorite Ivy song".|$|E
500|$|It also {{received}} praise by IGN's Jeremy Mullin, {{who gave it}} an overall 9 over 10, having had good opinion of the graphics used during the film and how the film expands Fullmetal Alchemists story. The film was compared to The End of Evangelion due to how both titles expand their anime's endings, resulting in a [...] "proper ending" [...] due to the characters' development featured in the film. Mullin <b>also</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> audio from Conqueror of Shamballa, but added {{that some of the}} English voice actors lacked accents. DVD Talk writer Todd Douglass Jr. <b>also</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> film as he was [...] "pleased to report that the story was handled nigh-flawlessly. The inclusion of real world events helps ground the fact that Edward is in our world, but there was just something surreal about that after seeing it." [...] He found the film's ending to be fitting for Fullmetal Alchemist and said it will be well received by fans from the series. While reviewing the special edition DVD, Douglass commented the extras featured in the DVD [...] "are worth the price." [...] However, he also added that [...] "some people just don't care about the extras" [...] and concluded that [...] "this is a strong reissue that could have possibly been better, but is fine just the same." ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Also</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> XM, the 605 {{initially}} {{suffered from}} quality issues {{that resulted in}} numerous breakdowns or malfunctions (particularly with the ambitious electrics), which severely damaged the car's reputation.|$|R
500|$|Chandran <b>also</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> game's soundtrack, {{calling it}} Abo's best work to date. He {{said that it}} is unmistakably the work of Abo, but {{improved}} over his previous soundtracks, and having [...] "enough layers of experimentation to showcase musical growth" [...] for it to not feel formulaic or like a rehash. He felt that the change in the series' setting was also reflected in the music, with the music's rhythm section being more noticeable and making the music feel more grounded, and with more use of [...] "earthy sonic textures" [...] compared to previous Infinity soundtracks' [...] "watery" [...] ones.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{nominated}} for a Writers Guild Award in 1991. Holly E. Ordway for DVD Talk Review commented positively on not just this episode, but the whole of the first season, saying, [...] "What's not to like about an episode like 'The Stakeout,' in which (among other things) we are witness to the invention of George's alter ego, Art Vandelay (and his import/export business)?" [...] Mary Kay Shilling and Mike Flaherty of Entertainment Weekly <b>also</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> episode but had some doubts, saying it was, [...] "A painfully realistic take on the lovers-to-friends transition that should have been more comically fruitful." ...|$|E
500|$|The trailer {{generated}} controversy {{around the}} depiction of the daughter's death. Fahey said that such elements are something video games usually [...] "shy away from", yet it {{is presented as a}} main focus in the trailer. Ben Parfitt from Market for Home Computing and Video Games found it offensive and thought that the team had stepped across the mark. Defending the trailer, Axis said that their depiction fit the overarching narrative. Robert Rath from The Escapist <b>also</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> segment, calling it [...] "deliberate and necessary", and thought that the overall effect would have been significantly hampered if had been removed from the trailer.|$|E

50|$|Tabloid!: A spoof comedy {{world where}} you are reporters for a sensationalist {{newspaper}} <b>like</b> <b>the</b> ones referenced in the film 'Men In Black'. <b>Also</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> film, it's all true. The Loch Ness monster is an alien, Elvis {{is alive and well}} etc.|$|R
500|$|Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament {{features}} greater background interaction {{than the}} original, such as {{levels in the}} dark. Williamson's favourite addition to the game was the sponge in the kitchen, which forced players to time their entry onto and exit from a platform. He <b>also</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> toilet seat track. David Darling initially disliked the physics, stating he liked the way the first game achieved skids without feeling like a train manoeuvring. It was worked on until it {{was similar to the}} original, and ultimately it worked [...] "perfectly". According to WIlliamson, the team spent [...] "enormous amounts of time" [...] testing the game.|$|E
500|$|Vibe magazine's Michael Gonzalez {{gave the}} album a {{favorable}} review, writing, [...] "Love Always is a marvelous musical testament to black {{love in the}} '90s." [...] He enjoyed the production, especially from Rory Bennett, and compared the duo to Frankie Lymon. He noticed K-Ci's lyrics in [...] "Baby Come Back" [...] were {{about his relationship with}} Mary J. Blige stating [...] " [...] wails like a man driven crazy by his missteps." [...] Gonzalez <b>also</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> songs [...] "Don't Rush (Take Love Slowly)", and [...] "You Bring Me Up". Borders Group recommended [...] "You Bring Me Up" [...] and praised the brothers' vocal talent.|$|E
500|$|Actor Billy Bob Thornton {{admitted}} to {{watching the show}} during a 2016 interview with GQ. He and his daughter Bella used to watch My Little Pony, which she eventually grew out of, and when searching for the series to watch again, came across Friendship Is Magic and started watching it with her. He <b>also</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> show's positive messages about how the world works, pointing to [...] "The Cutie Map" [...] as an example. On an episode of Late Night with Seth Meyers, Thornton also claimed that while his daughter's favorite character is Twilight Sparkle, his favorites were Fluttershy (who he said was his favorite because [...] "she talks like Marilyn Monroe") and Rainbow Dash.|$|E

5000|$|Ting Ting {{is a fan}} of K-pop, {{although}} she <b>also</b> <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> dangdut of Dewi Persik; she has stated that Persik's [...] "goyang gergaji" [...] ("saw move") requires skill and confidence that she herself does not possess.|$|R
500|$|Following {{the opening}} of Shambhala, Kirmes & Parks {{magazine}} named the roller coaster as the best European attraction introduced in 2012. Patrick Purcell from Mirror said that the roller coaster {{lived up to its}} hype and that, [...] "It {{is also one of the}} smoothest roller coasters I've encountered." [...] Sophie Castle from Travel Channel UK praised the height of Shambhala and said that, [...] "Shambhala is definitely an opportunity that shouldn’t be missed." [...] Ethan Williams from the Daily Mail gave the roller coaster a five out of five for its speed, surprise factor, and fear factor. He <b>also</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> amount of airtime the roller coaster gave. In 2013, Shambhala was featured on Travel Channel's television series [...]|$|E
500|$|Apollon Grigoriev {{wrote in}} The Finnish Herald: [...] "Dostoevsky starts {{to play in}} our {{literature}} the same role Hoffmann played in German literature... He became so deeply immersed {{in the life of}} civil servants that the dull and uninteresting everyday life became for him a nightmare close to madness." [...] Count Vladimir Sollogub <b>also</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> novel, stating that [...] "it was written with force and simplicity by a great talent." [...] Valerian Maykov noted after a number of publications by Dostoyevsky: [...] "Gogol was usually the leading social poet, while Dostoyevsky usually the leading psychological poet. The former is known as the representative of the contemporary society or contemporary circle, for the latter the society itself becomes interesting through its influence on other people." ...|$|E
500|$|Barnes {{was made}} captain of New South Wales for the 1946–47 Australian season, though he only managed to play three matches {{for the state}} team. One of those was the match against the touring MCC team, and Barnes was {{approached}} during the match about becoming an opening batsman for the forthcoming Test series. He wrote in his autobiography: [...] "I had never opened before and was a little dubious. I had, however, struck new balls at different periods of innings and was not afraid of that." [...] He <b>also</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> idea of batting ahead of Bradman in the batting order: [...] "Much better, I thought, to get in before him than to come later, like flat beer after champagne." ...|$|E
