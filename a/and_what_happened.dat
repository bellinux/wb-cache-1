25|$|Steven Truscott and Harper {{had been}} classmates in a {{combined}} grades 7/8 {{class at the}} Air Vice Marshal Hugh Campbell School located {{on the north side}} of the Air Force base. In the early evening of Tuesday, June 9, 1959, Truscott had given Harper a ride on the crossbar of his bicycle and proceeded from the vicinity of the school northwards along the County Road. The timing and duration of their encounter, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> while they were together, have been contentious issues since 1959.|$|E

Swallow captured both Hero and Baleine. Swallow {{was reported to have}} arrived at Rio de Janeiro on 17 August 1804. As noted earlier, Swallow took Hero back to Britain.

Dumbledore then rescues the real Moody from his magic trunk.|$|E
25|$|When media {{coverage}} and allegations of Constanzo's affinity towards Satanism died down, several Afro-Caribbean scholars stated that Constanzo's actions were fueled by his personal conviction and psychopathic involvement with Palo Mayombe. They argued that Constanzo used Palo Mayombe {{for his own}} financial, illicit, and psychological needs by convincing his cult members to help further his drug trafficking operations. Through human sacrifice, Constanzo promised his members that they were protected from the law. Other Afro-Caribbean scholars, on the other hand, alleged that Constanzo murdered Kilroy because he truly believed it was a requirement in his distorted view of Palo Mayombe. From this point of view, Constanzo's actions <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> in Matamoros could happened anywhere.|$|E
25|$|He'd {{had some}} success, {{but then he}} {{had a series of}} setbacks. And there was also the scandal around The Warriors; any success had been eclipsed by the killings in the theaters.

Meaning a year or so. <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> was the strike ended and the studios didn't have a lot of ready scripts.

25|$|A 60-minute special titled The Winner's Story is {{broadcast}} {{each year}} over the festive period, featuring the winner of that year's X Factor. Cameras follow the winner from {{the announcement of the}} result through the lead-up to the Christmas number one. As from 2010, one week before each series due to start, there features a special called X Factor Rewind looking back at the previous year's contestants <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to them during The X Factor and what has happened to them since the show ended. In Series 12, these programmes aired in late afternoon slots on weekends. They started two weeks before the show began, and finished the day the show started, {{for the first time on}} ITV. In 2016, the same format was used, but with only 2 episodes, and airing on ITV2.|$|E
25|$|According to tradition, Muhammad {{played a}} role in the {{restoration}} of the Kaaba, after parts of it had been destroyed by one of Mecca's frequent flash floods. When the reconstruction was almost done, disagreements arose among the clan leaders as to who would have the honor of lifting the sacred Black Stone into place. The disagreements increased to the point where the clans were about to take up arm against each other, when one of the elders suggested they take the advice of the next person who entered the gates of the Haram. This happened to be Muhammad. He spread out his cloak, put the stone in the middle and had members of the four major clans raise it to its destined position. Then he took it in his own hands and fitted it in its place. The cloak became an important symbol for later poets and writers because of this event <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> later as described in the Hadith of the Cloak.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2001, Campbell's {{contract}} expired. Mindful of the Bosman ruling <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> with Steve McManaman (Britain's first high-profile Bosman related transfer), Tottenham offered him a contract which would have made him the club's highest-ever paid player, but after months of negotiations and several public assurances he would stay at Spurs, Campbell stated his need to leave the club in order to play UEFA Champions League football, {{with the likes of}} England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson advising him of such a course. Several top continental clubs expressed interest in signing him, but he joined Arsenal— Tottenham's biggest rivals— on a free transfer. Campbell had previously stated in an interview with Spurs Monthly magazine that he would never play for Arsenal. The move was also unusual as no rumours of a move to Arsenal had been leaked or speculated upon in the media before the press conference revealing his decision, and many journalists in attendance had been led to believe they were there to witness the unveiling of goalkeeper Richard Wright, which would have been a routine sports news story.|$|E

25|$|According {{to general}} relativity, {{gravitational}} radiation is generated {{in situations where}} the curvature of spacetime is oscillating, such {{as is the case}} with co-orbiting objects. The gravitational radiation emitted by the Solar System is far too small to measure. However, gravitational radiation has been indirectly observed as an energy loss over time in binary pulsar systems such as PSR B1913+16. It is believed that neutron star mergers and black hole formation may create detectable amounts of gravitational radiation. Gravitational radiation observatories such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) have been created to study the problem. In February 2016, the Advanced LIGO team announced that they had detected gravitational waves from a black hole collision. On 14 September 2015, LIGO registered gravitational waves for the first time, as a result of the collision of two black holes 1.3 billion light-years from Earth. This observation confirms the theoretical predictions of Einstein and others that such waves exist. The event confirms that binary black holes exist. It also opens the way for practical observation and understanding of the nature of gravity and events in the Universe including the Big Bang <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> after it.|$|E
