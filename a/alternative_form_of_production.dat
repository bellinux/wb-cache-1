40|$|Are genetically {{modified}} crops compatible with sustainable agriculture? In reference to what was published today at Scidev (Gould, 2006) : “GM crops are compatible with sustainable agriculture”, I wish to comment: Massive use of transgenic crops poses potential ecological risks; {{genetically modified}} (GM) crops are not compatible with sustainable or organic farming or any other <b>alternative</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> GM agriculture compromises the capacity of farmers to manage their land by requiring increased use of herbicides and by reducing the farmers ’ options of rotations, since the poisoned soil is no longer suitable for nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Moreover, transgenes move be-yond their intended destination and hybridize with weed relatives, contaminating other, non-GM crops (see Marvier, 2001). It is impossible to remove genes that have escaped into natural gene pools. These affected gene pools have their fitness and genetic diversity greatly reduced (see Steinbrecher, 1996). Saying that GM crops will not be cultivated in areas where there are sexually compatible wild relatives and that this will avoid contamination is no guarantee, because of numerous fac...|$|E
40|$|The paper aims {{to study}} <b>alternative</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and {{consumption}} and their convergence {{as a way}} to create a new system’s dynamic. Firstly there is a theoretical discussion of the themes, then empirical evidence is discussed to make the case, and finally findings are discussed. The <b>alternative</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and consumption, such as social business and collaborative consumption, are proven to be economically viable, and may satisfy also social and environmental concerns, in alignment with sustainable development concepts. This suggests they represent an opportunity to leverage a significant transformation in the whole system. The analysis performed can serve to the elaboration of public policies for development, by fomenting these alternative forms; and to incentivize entrepreneurs to create similar enterprises to create positive impact and simultaneously generate profits. The empirical evidence collected is restricted. For further and more conclusive findings the range of the examples researched must be increased...|$|R

40|$|Even if the ‘social economy’ has {{traditionally}} been marginalized and a subordinated <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> within capitalist societies, the economic, social, territorial and environmental problems of the present times have tended {{to make it a}} strategic instrument. This is not only because of its qualities as an economic and management instrument, but also because it is an expression of a dynamic and creative civil society. The aim {{of this paper is to}} show the potential of the social economy, the way it has been encapsulated during the postwar period and the conditions that now favour its full development. In the face of new challenges, the efficiency criterion, hitherto used to assess <b>alternative</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> is shown to be insufficient. Some complementary criteria are proposed that in better with the new path society must follow if fundamental values have to be satisfied. Starting from these criteria and relating them to management in fields of growing social importance, a new insight into the advantages of the social economy over the market and public sectors can be obtained. Stimulated by such challenges, and connected to the new social movements, a new social economy is emerging with significant potential and a strategic role in managing society. But this development is not without serious problems, and objective and subjective conditions need first to be fulfilled. Social Economy, strategic role, values. ...|$|R

30|$|Through {{this text}} we’ve {{maintained}} that the debate around knowledge society {{and the role of}} education in it is in permanent tension between two forces: on the one hand, the prevalence <b>of</b> a <b>form</b> <b>of</b> accumulating value, based on intangible and infinite common goods, that is, knowledge as merchandise; and on the other, <b>alternative</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> value <b>production</b> associated to the commons and commons governance (Hess & Ostrom, 2007; Ostrom, 1990). This tension is reflected in the different levels of knowledge society associated with education. On the macro level through the educative and technology industries and public policies; on the medium level, through institutional transformations which define curricula, competences and educative models; and on the micro level, in the pedagogic practices that materialize in the specified decisions about the learning process and its relationship with technology.|$|R

The financial crisis invigorated this requirement, posing new challenges to the economic viability of conventional companies and demanding <b>alternative</b> organizational <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> Although a wealth of {{research has focused on}} capitalist companies, little {{attention has been paid to}} the way these challenges affected worker cooperatives. Drawing from a qualitative case study of the Mondragon Cooperative Group, this article discusses the obstacles to internationalization faced by worker cooperatives, as well as the specific conditions and implications involved. In particular, the article analyzes Mondragon's contradiction between being forced to expand and trying to keep cooperative values during this expansion. Two main actions aimed at responding to this contradiction are analyzed: the creation of mixed cooperatives and the extension of the corporate management model. The analysis of this process will shed light on actions for the global expansion of worker cooperatives...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is on the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> {{subjectivity}} and more precisely on generating new and <b>alternative</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> subjectivity and the role trust can play in it. In order to produce something new {{we need to understand}} what is the current situation and mode <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> so we can consider and produce alternatives to it. Therefore, in this thesis I first borrow Felix Guattari's understanding of subjectivity, which questions the causal and structural deterministic conceptualizations. Guattari proposes instead a rather multiple and more fluid subjectivity that vanishes the sharp separation between the individual and the collective. Such conceptualization underlines the individual and collective's agency and capacity to actively explore and produce particular <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> subjectivity. Subjectivity here is seen as an existential territory, in which we can become active cartographers and create new territories. I then go through some aspects of the dominant and established <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> today, the neoliberal capitalist one, and the biopolitical technologies of power discussed by Michel Foucault. The fact that the biopolitical <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> power nowadays address in a large extent directly to the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> subjectivity, makes it necessary to integrate such considerations within any attempt to explore particular <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> It {{is important to note that}} one of the main ways biopolitics work is by individualization, breaking down reality into elements in order to make them more controllable in accordance with state and market interests and logics. It sets social relations into the logics of the enterprise and competence, which, drawing upon Suely Rolnik's ideas, silences our sensibility to the other and our sense of mutual vulnerability. The latter is developed by Judith Butler towards the notion of mutual precariousness and responsibility. This leads me to go back to Guattari, now to his call to fight capitalism by producing new singularities, a way to expand our existential territories of experience. I continue with Rolnik's discussion of deterritorialization and her concept of 'resonant body' as a way to reactivate our sensibility to the other, diminished by capital neoliberalism. Finally, within this general frame on the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> subjectivity, I discuss the role trust plays in capital neoliberalism and biopolitics. This allows me to argue other ways of understanding trust that can contribute to foster disruptive and singular <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> subjectivity in social life and in the context of 'art spaces' -such as exhibition spaces and art institutues. The last part of this thesis includes the description, discussion and documentation <b>of</b> the artistic <b>production</b> that constitutes the whole of this thesis. The artistic work of this project is a cross-media site-specific installation that has been exhibited in summer of 2013 in Rauma Art Museum.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a nuanced interpretation <b>of</b> the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> {{space in}} the context of agritourism in Southern Ontario. It uses everyday life as a theoretical framework to expand conceptualizations <b>of</b> tourism <b>production</b> by enabling a discussion of how cultural practice is central to economic activity. I use agritourism to show how, in addition to being an important economic activity, tourism production is a culturally informed process with intrinsic value concerned with home and family, and contributes to individual utility, self-worth, identity and well-being for the tourism producer. In Southern Ontario, Agritourism has grown in popularity in the past thirty years. It is well-known as an economic diversification strategy but needs to be better understood as a cultural practice involving the social relations and everyday interactions of individual life contexts. I argue that the everyday reveals the <b>production</b> logic <b>of</b> well-being that is not necessarily based on an economic mentality but on the day-to-day negotiation of the home as a private place of residence, a place of work, and a tourism attraction open to the public. The question driving this dissertation is: to what extent does the everyday reveal <b>alternative</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> related to agritourism that are not necessarily driven by profit but by achieving a greater sense of well-being? At the heart of the research is an intimate knowledge of the farmers experience. I investigated these experiences by way of participant observation and semi-structured conversational style interviews. In addition to completing 27 interviews with a total of 32 self-employed people involved in operating/managing/running small to medium-large, and relatively large sized agritourism operations/businesses, I visited 16 agritourism attractions as an agritourist. An everyday approach shows that emotional well-being is a success factor in the production process, which points to agritourism as more than an economic activity. Adaptation, personal growth, family bonds and legacy, emotional connections, value systems, and protecting the privacy of the home are non-economic characteristics <b>of</b> tourism <b>production</b> that are about the embodied doings of day-to-day tasks that keep the destination running in the long term by preserving the well-being of the farmer and his/her family...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the EU government’s {{choice of a}} proper policy instrument given the cost structure of the foreign firms that are present at the EU market. The empirical model {{which is based on}} a 2 -digit Combined Nomenclature (CN) level sector data and information on the EU anti-dumping (AD) and production subsidy investigations from 1985 - 1995 supports the theoretical findings that the EU maximizes its social welfare if it imposes definitive AD measures on the foreign firm which enjoy location-specific and thus nontransferable cost advantage, and subsidizes domestic production if the foreign firm with transferable cost advantage can avoid AD duties by undertaking FDI. The overview <b>of</b> AD and <b>production</b> subsidy cases in the EU shows important changes in targeting sectors and countries in the observed period. Most of the AD cases that ended in imposition of definitive duties or negotiating price undertakings affected low-wage developing East-Asian countries and non-market economies.

40|$|Cysticercosis {{caused by}} Taenia solium {{frequently}} affects {{human health and}} rustic porciculture. Cysticerci may localize in {{the central nervous system}} of humans causing neurocysticercosis, a major health problem in undeveloped countries. Prevalence and intensity of this disease in pigs and humans are related to social factors (poor personal hygiene, low sanitary conditions, rustic rearing of pigs, open fecalism) and possibly to biological factors such as immunity, genetic background, and gender. The indispensable role of pigs as an obligatory intermediate host in the life cycle offers the possibility of interfering with transmission through vaccination of pigs. An effective vaccine based on three synthetic peptides against pig cysticercosis has been successfully developed and proved effective in experimental and field conditions. The well-defined peptides that constitute the cysticercosis vaccine offer the possibility to explore <b>alternative</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> antigen <b>production</b> and delivery systems that may improve the cost/benefit of this and other vaccines.

Currently, the PGDP is scheduled to be taken out of service in May, 2013. ?

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} conceptualizations of 'Talk-culture" {{from the late}} 19 th century through to the 1930 s. "Folk-culture" was broadly {{discussed}} in this period all over Europe (and Russia) and especially in science (Philologies, Folkloristics) and literature. More precisely, the thesis examines the debates held {{in the context of}} the Austrian-Hungarian Empire (Vienna and Prague) around the turn of the century. During this period of accelerating industrialization, commodification and separation of cultural spheres, a significant number of intellectuals and writers were interested in <b>alternative</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> cultural <b>production.</b> As the hitherto disregarded 'Talk-cultures" provide different notions of the artwork and the artist, their interest in 'Talk-culture" and 'Talk-art" is part of the broader discussion of the societal status and function of art and literature at the turn of the twentieth century. Representing a vehicle for the analysis and reflection of current cultural developments, the theorization of folklore and other <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> folk-art seeks responses to the aforementioned processes conceived as culturally problematic.

40|$|Purpose: Climate data, {{including}} {{historical climate}} observations and climate model outputs, are often utilised in climate impact assessments, to explore potential climate futures. However, characteristics {{often associated with}} ‘islandness’, such as smallness, land boundedness and isolation, may mean that climate impact assessment methods applied at broader scales cannot simply be downscaled to island settings. This paper discusses information needs and the limitations of climate models and datasets {{in the context of}} small islands, and explores how such challenges might be addressed. Design/methodology/approach: Reviewing existing literature, the paper explores challenges of islandness in top-down, model-led climate impact assessment, and bottom-up, vulnerability-led approaches. It examines how <b>alternative</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> knowledge <b>production</b> can play a role in validating models and in informing adaptation actions at the local level, and highlights decision-making techniques that can support adaptation even when data is uncertain. Findings: Small island topography is often too detailed for global or even regional climate models to resolve, but equally, local meteorological station data may be absent or uncertain, particularly in island peripheries. However, rather than viewing the issue as decision-making with big data at the regional/global scale versus with little or no data at the small island scale, a more productive discourse can emerge by conceptualising strategies of decision-making with unconventional types of data. Originality/value: This paper provides a critical overview and synthesis of issues relating to climate models, datasets and impact assessment methods as they pertain to islands, which can benefit decision-makers and other end-users of climate data in island communities...|$|R
40|$|Taking as its {{starting}} point the current resurgence {{of interest in}} Utopian <b>alternatives</b> to capitalist <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> including those based on cultural co-production, this chapter takes a critical look at Utopias, from Thomas More to the present day, which propose idealized future societies {{in which people are}} emancipated from exploitative labour relations.

It concludes that most Utopias fail to imagine future changes in the social division between paid and unpaid work. Where these have gone beyond a model of small self-sufficient agrarian communities, even if they have envisaged changes in the technical division of labour, they have reproduced existing gender divisions of labour, excluding unpaid reproductive work from their visions of emancipation and work-sharing. In so doing, they have constructed cultural labour as something which is supported invisibly by the reproductive labour of others...|$|R

With energy needs on the rise and our current energy consumption methods polluting the atmosphere, it is the right time to look at <b>alternative</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> energy <b>production.</b> Six Tall Tower wind observation sites were studied in Northwestern Missouri in order to observe the wind resource available along with some interesting effects. A verification of existing wind maps for the State of Missouri has been performed to assist in the positioning of wind farms. Validation of current wind maps using observational data is of key importance because the observational data is actually coming from the heights at which wind turbines will operate. Diurnal variations in the wind fields were also studied, and thus far have shown that the area is capable of sustaining wind energy resources. Another aspect researched involved pairing tower data with wind profiler data to determine if profiler data {{can be used as a}} proxy for lower level winds. Plots of profiler winds versus tower winds were also analyzed to determine a threshold for indicating the presence of low-level jets.

40|$|This study {{critically}} {{explores the}} relationships amongst the global, national, continental and alternative news agencies in South Africa {{and in a}} changing global context of news. It revisits previous studies’ findings on imbalances in global flows {{with a view to}} extending and updating these case studies. An extended-case study approach employing in-depth, open-ended interviews with news agency participants based primarily in South Africa and with the Pan African News Agency in Senegal is undertaken. The study postulates that news agencies do not operate independently of the broader external social environment. News agencies are influenced by changes in the global news environment and impacted upon by socio-economic, political and cultural processes and relations amongst nations. The main findings include firstly, that “intermediary changes” described as “adaptive strategies” at news agencies result from internal and external pressures on their operations <b>of</b> news <b>production,</b> selection and distribution. Internal pressures are identified as changes in ownership, and the gate-keeping function in the selection and exchange of news. External pressures are associated with the processes and relations of market-based global capitalism, which, it is theorized, gives rise to changing conditions described as a new phase of neo-liberal globalisation. Another finding related to the first, describes the adaptive strategies at news agencies as signifying a crisis in the global capitalist order and a transition to a post-industrial society. This post-industrial society presents the space for further investigation of the phenomenon of global consciousness, which is a further finding of the study. The prevalence <b>of</b> an <b>alternative</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> news <b>production,</b> citizens’ journalism, is seen as an example of an emerging public realm of opinion making, or, the public sphere. The study concludes that explanations for the persistence of imbalances in global news flows in the relationships among news agencies needs revision and updating, and that a global phenomenon, “global consciousness”, presents a challenge to the extreme market forces and the statist government control over media systems worldwide...|$|R
40|$|The {{twentieth century}} saw the rise <b>of</b> {{industrial}} food <b>production</b> in North America. It is widely held that industrialized agriculture produces negative social and ecological effects. In {{response to the}} exploitive practices of industrialized agriculture, a number of counter-movements emerged in the mid-twentieth century, including the organic farming movement. The traditional principles and practices of organic agriculture presented an <b>alternative</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> food <b>production,</b> distribution and consumption that accounted for the social and ecological costs associated with feeding mass populations. Over {{the last twenty years}} however, the organic food sector has seen phenomenal growth and changes, that challenge organic’s status as a counter-movement. Food safety issues have emerged regarding the industrialized, globalized food system that have prompted concerned consumers to seek alternatives, contributing to organic food’s rapid market expansion. As a result of its remarkable market growth, new actors have entered the organic food sector and organic food is now part of policies and regulatory frameworks of many OECD countries. Changes in both the structure of the organic food sector and the actors involved in it have challenged organic’s standing as a counter-movement to the industrialized food system, and what it means for a food to be defined as ‘organic’. This thesis examines the changing political economy of the organic food sector in Canada and the US over the past twenty years. It looks at the corporatization of the organic food sector and the insertion of organic into various levels of governance, including national policy-making agendas and global trade agreements. As a result of these changes it is argued that organic has fundamentally moved away from its original status as a challenge to the status quo, and is now part of the global food regime that it once so adamantly opposed and sought to replace. By examining the pressures for changing the traditional social and ecological principles of the organic movement, it is shown that it has effectively shifted from a social movement to an advocacy network...|$|R
40|$|Um dos grandes desafios para os próximos anos é desenvolver alternativas de produção para energias sustentáveis. O {{biodiesel}} vem se posicionando como uma opção para a substituição dos combustíveis fósseis. Sua produção se dá pela transesterificação entre uma gordura e um monoálcool, liberando glicerol, que corresponde a 10 % do volume da reação. Grandes incrementos na produção de biodisel resultarão em volumes proporcionais de glicerol residual. Estudos têm mostrado que bactérias anaeróbias estritas e bactérias fermentativas são capazes de produzir hidrogênio, um combustível de alto valor energético, que não gera gases poluentes durante a sua queima. Visto a importância de aumentar o valor agregado do glicerol residual, o presente trabalho teve como objetivo isolar e identificar por técnicas moleculares, bactérias presentes em lodos de estações de tratamento de resíduos, capazes de produzir hidrogênio utilizando glicerol residual da indústria de biodiesel como fonte de carbono. As amostras foram submetidas a choque térmico para eliminação de bactérias hidrogenotróficas, crescidas em meio contendo glicerol em condições de anaerobiose e analisadas para a formação de hidrogênio. Foram identificadas por sequenciamento do gene 16 S rRNA, quinze espécies bacterianas capazes de crescer em meio com glicerol, sendo que destas nove apresentaram capacidade de produção de hidrogênio, correspondendo a Enterobacter ludwigii, Shigella sonnei, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Staphylococcus warneri, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus atrophaeus e Citrobacter freundii. Os isolados de Bacillus amyloliquefaciens mostraram maior rendimento na produção de hidrogênio com valores de 0, 50 ± 0, 20 mol H 2 /mol de glicerol, utilizando o meio enriquecido com 1, 5 % de glicerol residual. Adicionalmente, foi realizada análise de BLAST para verificar a presença dos genes HycC, HycE, HycF, HyfC, HyfF e HyfH relacionados à produção de hidrogênio. Este estudo foi desenvolvido utilizando apenas os microrganismos do gênero Bacillus, uma vez que, dentre os microrganismos isolados, apenas os Bacillus apresentam sequenciamento completo disponível na rede de bioinformática. Foi verificado que B. amyloliquefaciens, B. licheniformis e B. artrophaeus não possuem os genes específicos analisados, mas estes genes possuem similaridade com outros genes e proteínas que parecem desempenhar funções no transporte de hidrogênio para exterior da célula. Os resultados indicam que existe um grande potencial para a seleção de bactérias produtoras de hidrogênio nos efluentes avaliados que são capazes de metabolizar o glicerol residual com a geração de hidrogênio, como combustível de energia renovável. One of {{the major}} challenges for the coming years is to develop <b>alternative</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> for sustainable energy. The biodiesel is positioning itself as an option for the replacement of fossil fuels. Its production is by transesterification between a fat and a monoalcohol, releasing glycerol, which corresponds to 10 % {{of the volume of}} the reaction. Large increases in the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> biodiesel result in proportional amounts of crude glycerol. Studies have shown that strict anaerobic and fermentative bacteria are able to produce hydrogen, a fuel of high energy value, which does not generate polluting gases, during its burning. Given the importance of increasing the added value-added of crude glycerol, {{the purpose of this study}} was to isolate and identify by molecular techniques, bacteria present in sewage sludge from waste treatment plants, it is capable of producing hydrogen using crude glycerol of biodiesel industry, as a carbon source. The samples were subjected to thermal shock to eliminate hydrogenotrophic bacterias, grown in the medium containing glycerol under anaerobic conditions and analyzed to produce hydrogen. Were identified by sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene, 15 bacterial species able to grow in medium with glycerol, and from these, nine showed the ability <b>of</b> hydrogen <b>production,</b> corresponding to Enterobacter ludwigii, Shigella sonnei, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Staphylococcus warneri, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus atrhopheus and Citrobacter freundii. The Bacillus amyloliquefaciens isolate showed higher yield in the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen, with values of 0. 50 ± 0. 20 mol H 2 /mol of glycerol, using the enriched medium with 1. 5 % crude glycerol. In addition, BLAST analysis were performed to check the presence of genes HycC, HycE, HycF, HyfC, HyfF and HyfH related to hydrogen production. This study was developed using microorganisms of genus Bacillus, since, among the isolated microorganisms, only the Bacillus have complete DNA sequencing available. It was found that B. amyloliquefaciens, B. licheniformis and B. artrophaeus do not have the specific genes analyzed, but these genes have similarity with other genes and proteins that appear to perform roles in the transport of hydrogen to outside the cell. The results indicate that there is a great potential for the selection of bacteria producing hydrogen in the effluents evaluated, that are able to metabolize crude glycerol with the generation of hydrogen as a fuel for renewable energy...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 This ethnographic study {{explores the}} social aspects of {{agricultural}} land-use in the Marys River region. The study seeks {{to understand how}} farmers define sustainability and how their views on agricultural issues help to define {{a sense of place}} and identity in the Marys River region, {{within the context of the}} globalized agricultural system. This project builds on past research utilizing the theory and praxis of political ecology, but also incorporates elements of bioregionalism to develop a theoretical model of regional political ecology for an integrated and multidisciplinary approach to answering the research questions. The study asks: 1) How do farmers in the Marys River region define agricultural sustainability? 2) What methods do farmers use to develop more sustainable agroecosystems? 3) What do farmers consider to be the most important issues in developing a more sustainable regional community within the globalized system of agriculture? A critical synthesis of information is developed establishing bioregional political ecology within the conceptual framework of the project. The study then describes the broad social and economic contexts that potentially shape and constrain farmer conceptualizations of sustainability, focusing on the contrast between the development and characteristics of the globalized system of industrial agriculture and more traditional systems-based methods considered to be <b>alternative</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> agricultural <b>production.</b> The study then uses this conceptual framework to integrate an historical account describing the development of agriculture in the Marys River region with contemporary ethnographic information collected through participant observation and semi-structured interviews with farmers to provide a more holistic understanding of contemporary definitions of agricultural sustainability. This approach of integrating the qualitative information gathered from local farmers with historical and contemporary background information on land-use allowed for a better understanding of farmers' perspectives and definitions of sustainability. A principle finding from this research was that farmers throughout the Marys River region, regardless of farming styles and practices, consider sustainability primarily as the ability to continue farming into the extended future. Farmers' definitions of sustainability are inherently tied to the 'space' of the farm and these findings provide a common ground for dialogue among stakeholders with differing worldviews. This study helps to fill gaps in the existing literature on sustainability and agricultural land-use in the region; namely the perception and conceptualization of sustainability by its farmers. This more comprehensive understanding of how farmers relate to sustainability will help farmers, policymakers, and other institutions to better work together in making more informed decisions toward building stronger communities and developing a more sustainable bioregion within the global marketplac...|$|R
