5|$|Sculptural {{fragments}} to Rodin were autonomous works, and {{he considered}} them {{the essence of}} his artistic statement. His fragments– perhaps lacking arms, legs, or a head– took sculpture further from its traditional role of portraying likenesses, <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> realm where forms existed for their own sake. Notable examples are The Walking Man, Meditation without Arms, and Iris, Messenger of the Gods.|$|E

5|$|Carlton {{then turned}} his {{attention}} to the other six residents, pouring gasoline underneath the door of the far end of the residence and setting it on fire. Draftsman Herbert Fritz managed to break open a window and escape, though he broke his arm in the process. Carlton then entered the other dining room and killed Brodelle. He then hid, waiting for the other residents to try to escape. As foreman William Weston and his 13-year-old son Ernest ran through the door, Carlton attacked with the hatchet. The Westons escaped, but Ernest died from his wounds hours later. Carlton sought out the final two residents, laborer Thomas Brunker and gardener David Lindblom. Brunker and Lindblom managed to fight off Carlton and escape, but died days later from their burns and injuries. With the house empty, Carlton ran to the basement <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> fireproof furnace chamber. He brought a small vial of hydrochloric acid with him as a fallback plan in case the heat became too much for him to handle. Carlton did attempt suicide by swallowing the acid, but it failed to kill him.|$|E
5|$|Cromwell {{did much}} work through his many offices {{to remove the}} tasks of {{government}} from the Royal Household (and ideologically from the personal body of the King) <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> public state. He did so, however, in a haphazard fashion that left several remnants, not least because he needed to retain Henry's support, his own power, {{and the possibility of}} actually achieving the plan he set out. Cromwell made the various income streams put in place by Henry VII more formal and assigned largely autonomous bodies for their administration. The role of the King's Council was transferred to a reformed Privy Council, much smaller and more efficient than its predecessor. A difference emerged between the financial health of the king, and that of the country, although Cromwell's fall undermined much of his bureaucracy, which required his hand to keep order among the many new bodies and prevent profligate spending that strained relations as well as finances. Cromwell's reforms ground to a halt in 1539, the initiative lost, and he failed to secure the passage of an enabling act, the Proclamation by the Crown Act 1539. He too was executed, on 28 July 1540.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the race}} John Downie crashed into a pub in Ballasalla, but the car did not sustain {{extensive}} damage {{and he was able}} to continue the race. At Keppel Gate on the Mountain Road, Frederick Bennett, who had been unable to take part in the practice sessions and therefore did not know the course very well, approached a corner with too much speed in his Cadillac and crashed, ripping off two of the wheels. Bennett managed to stay in the vehicle and avoided serious injury. Another driver to go off the track was J. Hadley in his Wolseley, who also carried too much speed into a corner, leading him to drive off through a hedge <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> field. The Thornycroft driven by Tom Thornycroft had been following closely behind, and the two cars collided during the incident, damaging one of the Thornycroft's rear wheels. Napier in his Arrol-Johnston made the quickest circuit of the first lap in one hour, 32 minutes and 36 seconds.|$|E

5|$|Edith {{continued}} {{moving to}} the west-northwest, heading towards the coast of Mexico, but early on September 14, the storm stalled while located just {{off the coast of}} Tamaulipas. A mid-latitude trough of low pressure approached the storm, and caused Edith to turn to slowly drift towards the northeast. Located only miles from the Mexican coast, Edith again failed to strengthen until September 15, when it accelerated northeastward and regained hurricane status. The hurricane turned to the east-northeast as it approached the coast of Louisiana, and made landfall on September 16 in a sparsely populated area 30 miles (48 km) east of Cameron with winds of 105 mph (170 km/h), equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane in the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Edith rapidly weakened over land, degenerating into a tropical storm over Louisiana, <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tropical depression over Mississippi. It continued to the east-northeast, and dissipated over northwestern Georgia on September 18.|$|E
5|$|Hare was {{released}} on 5 February 1829—his extended stay in custody had been undertaken for his own protection—and was assisted in leaving Edinburgh in disguise by the mailcoach to Dumfries. At one of its stops he was recognised by a fellow-passenger, Erskine Douglas Sandford, a junior counsel who had represented Wilson's family; Sandford informed his fellow passengers of Hare's identity. On arrival in Dumfries the news of Hare's presence spread and a large crowd gathered at the hostelry where he was due to stay the night. Police arrived and arranged for a decoy coach to draw off the crowd while Hare escaped through a back window <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> carriage which {{took him to the}} town's prison for safekeeping. A crowd surrounded the building; stones were thrown at the door and windows and street lamps were smashed before 100 special constables arrived to restore order. In the small hours of the morning, escorted by a sheriff officer and militia guard, Hare was taken out of town, set down on the Annan Road and instructed to make his way to the English border. There were no subsequent reliable sightings of him and his eventual fate is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Iris of 2001 was {{the most}} {{destructive}} hurricane in Belize since Hurricane Hattie in 1961. Iris was the second-strongest storm of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season, behind Hurricane Michelle. It was the ninth named storm, fifth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the year, forming from a tropical wave on October4 just southeast of Barbados. It moved westward through the Caribbean, intensifying into a tropical storm on October5 south of Puerto Rico <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> hurricane the following day. While passing south of the Dominican Republic, Iris dropped heavy rainfall that caused landslides, killing eight people. Later, the hurricane passed south of Jamaica, where it destroyed two houses. On reaching the western Caribbean Sea, Iris rapidly intensified into a Category4 on the Saffir–Simpson scale. A small hurricane with an eye of only 7mi (11km) in diameter, Iris reached peak winds of 145mph (230km/h) before making landfall in southern Belize near Monkey River Town on October9. The hurricane quickly dissipated over Central America, although its remnants contributed {{to the formation of}} Tropical Storm Manuel in the eastern Pacific Ocean.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, the Intercultural Center, a {{multicultural}} student space, moved into Lathrop {{in spite of}} initial disagreement {{by members of the}} house two years earlier when the idea was first proposed. The Intercultural Center later moved out of Lathrop's basement and into its own dedicated space in the early 1990s, at which point it was replaced by a Jewish co-op and kitchen. In 1995, the Kosher Co-Op moved out of Lathrop <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> newly acquired Jewish house {{across the street from the}} college.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Monster Cable Products {{moved out}} of Lee's garage <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> San Francisco facility. It also {{introduced}} its second audio cable, Interlink.

It attempted to enter the market for audio devices for automotive briefly, but withdrew to focus on home entertainment. Its first product intended for the mass-market was introduced in 1987.|$|E
5|$|In June 1942 Mutsu, {{commanded}} by Rear Admiral Gunji Kogure, {{was assigned to}} the Main Body of the 1st Fleet during the Battle of Midway, together with Yamato, Nagato, Hosho, the light cruiser Sendai, nine destroyers and four auxiliary ships. Following the loss of all four carriers on 4 June, Yamamoto attempted to lure the American forces west to within range of the Japanese air groups at Wake Island, <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> night engagement with his surface forces, but the American forces withdrew and Mutsu saw no action. After rendezvousing with the remnants of the striking force on 6 June, about half of the survivors from the sunken aircraft carriers of the 1st Air Fleet were transferred to Mutsu. She arrived at Hashirajima on 14 June.|$|E

5|$|NY132 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with the concurrency of US202 and NY35 {{in front of}} Franklin D. Roosevelt State Park {{in the town of}} Yorktown. NY132 proceeds north along Old Yorktown Road, crossing through a residential section of Yorktown. After passing a junction with Meadowcrest Drive, the route takes a turn to the northwest then returns to its northerly progression near Strang Boulevard. Remaining a two-lane residential street through Yorktown, NY132 passes Lakeland Copper Beech Middle School and turns northwest once again towards more homes <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> partial diamond interchange with the Taconic State Parkway. At this interchange, there is no access from NY132 to the northbound Taconic, and no access from the southbound Taconic to NY132.|$|E
5|$|NY195 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with NY11B in the hamlet of Nicholville within {{the town of}} Lawrence. It headed north out of the community <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> series of cultivated fields. About quarter of the way between Nicholville and Lavery's Corner, the fields gave way to forested areas, which themselves ceded to more fields near an intersection with Cady Road. NY195 continued on to Lavery's Corner, where it intersected {{with a pair of}} county highways and turned east toward Lawrenceville. On its way to Lawrenceville, the highway met Ferris Road, the last through route along NY195's routing excluding the roadway at its northern terminus. East of Ferris Road, NY195 curved northeast to enter Lawrenceville, where it ended at US11.|$|E

Here, the route intersected with several east–west highways of local importance and passed by Beeman Creek Park before meeting Tonawanda Creek Road at a junction on the southern bank of Tonawanda Creek. The highway turned west at this junction, following Tonawanda Creek Road {{along the edge of the}} creek to the Clarence–Amherst town line, where NY268 ended at a junction with NY78 in the hamlet of Millersport.|$|E
5|$|On 4 March 1941, Pattle claimed three enemy Fiat G.50bis fighters (nos 22–24) {{belonging}} to 24oGruppo. He claimed the first, while Nigel Cullen — another leading fighter ace — flew as his wingman. Escorting Blenheims to attack Italian warships, the pair were engaged by a lone G.50. Pattle engaged the Fiat and shot it down — its landing gear dropped {{down and it}} rolled over <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> mountainside just north of Himare. Pattle searched for Cullen, expecting him to be behind him but saw {{no sign of the}} Australian. He assumed Cullen had gone off to scout for more enemy aircraft after missing out on Pattle's victory. Now alone, he was attacked by another lone G.50bis while flying towards Vlorë. After a brief combat, he shot down the Fiat. It crashed into the sea southwest of Vlorë harbour. He then became involved with a third such fighter over Valona harbour and claimed to have shot this down into the sea in flames {{on the west side of}} the promontory. After his return to base, he was informed Cullen had been posted missing in action. Pattle and the squadron considered he had most likely been shot down and killed.|$|E
5|$|On August28, a {{tropical}} wave developed into {{a tropical}} depression near Cape Verde. After moving west-southwestward, it turned to the northwest, intensifying into a tropical storm on August31 <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> hurricane on September2. Passing northeast of the Lesser Antilles, Carol rapidly intensified to Category 5 intensity, reaching peak winds of 160mph (260km/h) on September3, making it the strongest hurricane of the season. It gradually weakened, bypassing Bermuda on September6 and producing high waves. Carol later turned to the north-northeast, brushing Cape Cod and causing boating accidents across New England. Four {{people were killed in}} the region. Fishing losses totaled around $1million (1953USD, $ USD).|$|E
