500|$|Upon his death, Harding {{was deeply}} mourned. He {{was called a}} man of peace in many European newspapers; American journalists praised him lavishly, with some {{describing}} him as having given his life for his country. His associates were stunned by his demise; Daugherty wrote, [...] "I can hardly write about it or <b>allow</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> think about it yet." [...] Hughes stated, [...] "I cannot realize that our beloved Chief is no longer with us." ...|$|E

500|$|One of {{the sensations}} of the Games was black American track star Jesse Owens, who won four gold medals. According to some American press stories, Hitler left the stadium rather than {{shake hands with}} him. This was not the case; Hitler {{had been told by}} IOC {{president}} Baillet-Latour not to shake hands with the winners unless he was prepared to shake hands with all gold medalists, which he was not; this, however was not publicized. According to Butterfield, in later years retellings of what Brundage termed [...] "a fairy tale" [...] roused the American to [...] "acute fury". Hitler was, however, asked by his youth leader, Baldur von Schirach, to meet Owens, and he refused, [...] "Do you really think that I'd <b>allow</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> be photographed shaking hands with a Negro?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first two}} {{books in the}} Inheritance Cycle, Eragon and Eldest, sold over 15million copies {{worldwide}} together. Alfred A. Knopf Books for Young Readers, an imprint of Random House Children's Books and {{the publisher of the}} books, prepared Brisingrs release by printing 2.5million copies in advance, Random House's biggest initial print run of a children's book. Paolini said he tried not to let the expectations surrounding Brisingr affect him, stating that [...] "As an author, I found that I can't really <b>allow</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> think about those things. I actually fell into that trap with the first part of Brisingr. I sat there and I started obsessing about every single word." [...] He turned away from his computer and began writing on parchment paper instead. The pages were rewritten on a computer document afterwards by his mother.|$|E
500|$|Appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 30April 1954 for {{his service}} in Malaya, Scherger joined the Air Board as Air Member for Personnel in March 1955. During his term he {{commissioned}} a review into {{the effectiveness of}} the syllabus at RAAF College for meeting the future needs of the Air Force in an age of missiles and nuclear weaponry. This led to a policy of cadets undertaking academic degrees, in line with similar institutions in the other armed services; the College was subsequently renamed RAAF Academy. Promoted air marshal, he became Chief of the Air Staff in March 1957, succeeding Air Marshal Sir John McCauley. Long identified as a strong contender for the RAAF's senior role, Scherger was described by Air Marshal Hardman as [...] "easily the best material on offer". He declared that as an administrator he was [...] "not going to <b>allow</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> be bogged down with minor matters of detail...Broad policy comes from the top. These decisions have to be implemented in the commands—and that's the way it's going to be." ...|$|E

500|$|In the 2010–11 season, Valbuena was {{inserted}} {{as a starter}} by Deschamps {{for the start of}} the campaign despite the arrivals of wingers Loïc Rémy and André Ayew. Valbuena was also hampered by the constant media inquiries about what happened at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, on which he has refused to comment, stating [...] "I was a [...] in the France team, I will not <b>allow</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> discuss the events" [...] and that he was [...] "trying to forget" [...] the incident. Valbuena scored his first goal of the season on 12 September 2010 in a 2–2 draw with Monaco. On 23 November, he scored the opening goal in the team's 3–0 win over Russian club FC Spartak Moscow in the Champions League. The victory resulted in Marseille qualifying for the knockout portion of the competition for the first time since 2000. Four days later, Valbuena scored the third goal in the team's 4–0 win over Montpellier. On 22 January, Valbuena suffered a medial ligament sprain in his left knee as a result of a tackle from Ayew during a training session. He was, initially, ruled out for up to six weeks, but returned to training ahead of the team's Champions League match against English club Manchester United on 22 February. Valbuena made his return to the team in the second leg at Old Trafford appearing as a second-half substitute. Marseille were defeated 2–1 away, which resulted in the club losing on aggregate by the same scoreline.|$|E
2500|$|People with losses {{or other}} trauma, such as sexual abuse in {{childhood}} and adolescence may often develop this type of attachment and {{tend to agree with}} the following statements: [...] "I am somewhat uncomfortable getting close to others. I want emotionally close relationships, but I find it difficult to trust others completely, or to depend on them. I sometimes worry that I will be hurt if I <b>allow</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> become too close to others." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2007, claimed psychic John Edward {{appeared}} on Headline Prime, hosted by Glenn Beck. When {{asked if he}} would take Randi's challenge, Edward responded, [...] "It's funny. I was on Larry King Live once, and they asked me the same question. And I made a joke , and I'll say the same thing here: Why would I <b>allow</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> be tested by somebody who's got an adjective as a first name?" [...] Beck simply allowed Edward to continue, ignoring the challenge.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never!" [...] said Mrs. Bold, [...] "never. If I {{have ever}} <b>allowed</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> do {{anything}} to encourage such an idea, I have been very much to blame--very much to blame indeed." ...|$|R

[...] "I get off on working with creative energy", Aguilera said. [...] "That's when I'm most at home and feel happiest. And all these people brought about new sides of me. It was a big collaboration-fest, and it felt so good and rewarding in the end, because I was just so happy with the work and the new territories that I ventured out to." [...] Aguilera also remarked that her son inspired her to experiment in ways [...] "that maybe I've been afraid {{to do in the}} past, to <b>allow</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> go to a place of 'less singing,' [...] " [...] she says.

2500|$|In 2014, Lopez {{received}} a demo {{of a song}} called [...] "Big Booty", produced by Diplo, and was encouraged to record the track, with everybody indicating {{that it was the}} type of track she needed to do. However, Lopez claimed: [...] "Never in my life will I do a song called 'Big Booty', it would never happen," [...] explaining that she felt {{it was going to be}} a joke and the album was very important. After some reluctance, Lopez ended up writing the track and played the demo in her car to see if it would work. While playing some tracks in her car, with her twins, Lopez stated that they instantly loved that the track: [...] "As soon as they heard 'Big Booty' they went crazy. They loved this song and because of that I recorded it," [...] she admitted. During a brunch where she debuted multiple songs from A.K.A., Lopez spoke of the track, saying: [...] "I didn't <b>allow</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> be put in a box. On this album, I did all of it. This is who I am and i have to embrace all of that and be as honest as I can be." ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon being {{convinced}} {{that he had not}} robbed anyone of their melody, McCartney began writing lyrics to suit it. As Lennon and McCartney were known to do at the time, a substitute working lyric, titled [...] "Scrambled Eggs" [...] (the working opening verse was [...] "Scrambled eggs/Oh my baby how I love your legs/Not as much as I love scrambled eggs"), was used for the song until something more suitable was written. In his biography, , McCartney recalled: [...] "So first of all I checked this melody out, and people said to me, 'No, it's lovely, and I'm sure it's all yours.' It took me a little while to <b>allow</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> claim it, but then like a prospector I finally staked my claim; stuck a little sign on it and said, 'Okay, it's mine!' It had no words. I used to call it 'Scrambled Eggs'." [...] The original song, Scrambled Eggs, was written to hold the music and phrasing in place. It was performed by Paul McCartney and Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, and has been recorded and released by the Brittles, a Beatles-pastiche band.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh, that's all right,' I said. I {{tried to}} make my voice indifferent, for I was on guard against {{insidious}} friendliness.
