5|$|In 1954, the Oslo City Council {{decided to}} build a four-line metro to the new suburbs {{to the east of}} the city center. The plans would lead to the system opening in 1966, after the {{conversion}} of the Østensjø and the Lambertseter Line of the Oslo Tramway to metro standard, and supplemented with the new Furuset and Grorud Line. The system would feature higher and longer platforms, allowing step-free access to six-car trains, <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> <b>protection</b> and third rail power supply. This would make the metro incompatible with the existing tramways.|$|E
5|$|The entire metro {{system and}} the trains are run by a fully {{automated}} computer system, located at the Control and Maintenance Center south of Vestamager Station. The automatic train control (ATC) consists of three subsystems: <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> <b>protection</b> (ATP), automatic train operation (ATO) and automatic train supervisory (ATS). The ATP is responsible for keeping the trains' speed, ensuring that doors are closed before departure and switches are correctly set. The system uses fixed block signaling, except around stations, where moving block signaling is used.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, {{the city}} decided {{to connect the}} four {{suburban}} lines west of the city center with the Oslo Metro. The Sognsvann Line {{was selected as the}} first line to be upgraded, so the two systems would become compatible. The line was upgraded to metro standard by replacing the overhead wire with a third-rail power supply and installing <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> <b>protection.</b> All the stations were rebuilt, with platforms lengthened from fitting two-car to fitting four-car trains, and the platform height increased. The third rail required all level crossings to be removed, resulting in the line being rebuilt several places to allow the road to underpass or overpass. The light rail permitted passengers to cross the lines at the stations, but this was made impossible with metro standard. Because of this, underpasses or overpasses were built at the stations.|$|E
25|$|A {{fall-back}} signalling system, {{relying on}} conventional track-circuit occupancy detection, is included to ensure fully <b>automatic</b> operation and <b>train</b> <b>protection</b> {{independent of the}} radio system.|$|R
50|$|Automatische TreinBeïnvloeding or ATB (English: <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> Control) is a Dutch <b>train</b> <b>protection</b> system {{developed}} in the 1950s. Its installation was spurred by the Harmelen train disaster of 1962.|$|R
30|$|Independent {{innovation}} of the CBTC {{system can}} encourage {{us to keep}} up with the latest technological development of the international train operation control systems. Core technologies of the CBTC system, such as bi-directional transmission technology between the vehicle and ground, precise positioning of the <b>train,</b> <b>automatic</b> safety <b>protection,</b> and automatic driving, are mastered [16]. CBTC for urban rail transit systems in China were developed in full accordance with the CEN-ELEC international security standards, thereby reaching the highest level internationally.|$|R
5|$|In 1954, the Oslo City Council {{decided to}} build a four-line metro to the new suburbs {{to the east of}} the city center. The plans called for the system to open in 1966, with the {{conversion}} of the Østensjø Line and the Lambertseter Line of the Oslo Tramway, and the new Furuset Line and Grorud Line. The system would feature higher and longer platforms, allowing step-free access to six-car trains, <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> <b>protection</b> and third-rail power supply. This would make the metro incompatible with the existing tramways in Oslo. The first units in the T1000 series were two single-car prototypes designated T. They were test-run on the existing tramways from 1959 to 1960, and were then put into service on the Kolsås Line. Prone to technical faults, they were taken out of regular service in 1982.|$|E
5|$|The first idea {{to launch}} a citywide rapid transit was {{launched}} in 1912 {{with the construction of}} the Ekeberg Line; constructed with the same width profile as the Holmenkollen Line, the plan was to build a tunnel under the city center and run through trains, but large cost expenditures on the first section of the Common Tunnel ceased the plans. As part of the rebuilding after World War II a planning office for a T-bane was established in 1949, with the first plans launched in 1951; in 1954, the city council decided to build the T-bane network in Eastern Oslo with four branches. The system would feature improvements over the suburban lines in having a third rail power supply, cab signaling with <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> <b>Protection,</b> stations long enough for six-car trains and level crossings replaced by bridges and underpasses—specifications christened metro standard.|$|E
5|$|To {{replace the}} aging Class C trains, from 1985 to 1987, ten T4s were {{converted}} to T1300. They were equipped with a pantograph, received a new front and the doors were moved. Six additional T4s were converted in 1989, and given the designation T8. These only had the pantographs equipped and kept the same front and door arrangement. With {{the introduction of the}} T1300, the western lines could remove the conductor and have single-manned trains with the motorman selling tickets. The T1300-units have had better regularity than the older models they replaced. However, because they are designed for a closed system with <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> <b>protection,</b> the braking systems are not sufficiently dimensioned for when the drivers use line of sight to regulate the speed and distances between trains. The 1300 units were numbered 1301–1349. After the conversions, Oslo Sporveier operated 49 T1300-cars and 146 T1000-cars. The trains were originally painted red with a beige cheatline.|$|E
50|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>train</b> control (ATC) is {{a general}} class of <b>train</b> <b>protection</b> systems for {{railways}} that involves a speed control mechanism in response to external inputs. ATC systems tend to integrate various cab signalling technologies and they use more granular deceleration patterns {{in lieu of the}} rigid stops encountered with the older <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> stop technology. ATC can also be used with <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> operation (ATO) and is usually considered to be the safety-critical part of the system.|$|R
50|$|The {{intermittent}} inductive <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> stop (also {{referred to}} as IIATS or just <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> stop or ATS) is a <b>train</b> <b>protection</b> system used in North American mainline railroad and rapid transit systems. It makes use of magnetic reluctance to trigger a passing train to take some sort of action. The system {{was developed in the}} 1920s by the General Railway Signal Company as an improvement on existing mechanical train stop systems and saw limited adoption before being overtaken by more advanced cab signaling and <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> control systems. The system remains in use after having been introduced in the 1920s.|$|R
25|$|The {{signalling}} will be {{a mixture}} of ETCS 2 on the western branches from 2019, communication-based <b>train</b> control with <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> operation on the core and Abbey Wood branch (with a possible later upgrade to ETCS), and Automatic Warning System with <b>Train</b> <b>Protection</b> & Warning System on the Great Eastern Main Line.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} {{section of}} the metro was the Holmenkollen Line, which opened as a suburban tramway in 1898. The Røa Line was the next to open as a branch, in 1912. The system became the first Nordic underground railway in 1928, when the underground line to Nationaltheatret was opened. The Østensjø Line opened in 1923, the Sognsvann Line in 1934, and the Kolsås Line in 1942. The opening of the upgraded metro system in the eastern boroughs occurred in 1966, after {{the conversion of the}} 1957 Lambertseter Line to metro standard. This involved the implementation of <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> <b>protection,</b> longer platforms, replacement of the overhead wires with third rail and removal of level crossings. This was followed by the conversion of the Østensjø Line to metro standard, as well as the new Grorud Line and the Furuset Line. From 1987 to 1993, trains terminated at Stortinget, which has since then been the basis for the kilometer markers. In 1993, for the first time, trains ran through the city between the two networks in the Common Tunnel. The latest extension is the 2006 opening of the Ring Line, which connects the eastern and western network north of the city center. Between 2006 and 2010, the older T1000 stock was replaced with MX3000 trains.|$|E
25|$|Following the Southall and Ladbroke Grove rail crashes, GWR {{requires}} its HSTs to have <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> <b>Protection</b> and Automatic Warning System {{safety systems}} in operation. If either is faulty, {{the train is}} not used.|$|E
25|$|The Shinkansen employs an ATC (Automatic Train Control) system, {{eliminating}} the need for trackside signals. It uses a comprehensive system of <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> <b>Protection.</b> Centralized traffic control manages all train operations, and all tasks relating to train movement, track, station and schedule are networked and computerized.|$|E
50|$|The TBL {{system has}} been in use on Hong Kong's East Rail Line since the late 1990s as a {{replacement}} for the line's original Automatic Warning System (AWS), a British <b>train</b> <b>protection</b> system, so as to allow for increased traffic and capacity on the East Rail Line. With the introduction of an <b>Automatic</b> <b>train</b> operation (ATO) system supplied by Alstom in 2002 the said TBL system now functions as the safety-critical part of the said ATO system, and also serves as a fallback in case the ATO system fails or is not available.|$|R
50|$|A <b>Train</b> <b>automatic</b> {{stopping}} controller (定位置停止装置) (TASC), is a <b>train</b> <b>protection</b> system {{currently used}} only in Japan. It allows trains equipped with TASC to stop automatically at stations {{without the need}} for the train operator to operate the brakes manually.|$|R
50|$|The {{most popular}} {{implementation}} of ATS for the mainline railroad industry {{was made by}} the General Railway Signal company starting in the 1920s and consisted of inductive coils mounted just outside the right hand rail in relation to the direction of travel. Often referred to as just ATS in railroad operating books, the full name of the system is Intermittent Inductive <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> Stop to differentiate it from mechanical systems being offered at the time. The popularity of ATS as a <b>train</b> <b>protection</b> mechanism fell after the introduction of track coded cab signals in the 1930s.|$|R
25|$|LZB {{includes}} <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> <b>Protection.</b> If {{the driver}} exceeds the permitted speed plus a margin LZB will activate the buzzer and an overspeed light. If the driver fails {{to slow the}} train the LZB system can apply the brakes itself, bringing the train to a halt if necessary.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with this plan, the first 8-car trains of 1992 Stock entered service in 1993, {{and while the}} necessary signalling works for ATO were in progress, One Person Operation (OPO) was phased in between 1994 and 1995. <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> <b>Protection</b> was implemented 1995–97 and ATO 1999–2001, with a centralised control centre in West London.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, the Kolsås Line {{was closed}} for renovations. Although {{connected}} to the Oslo Metro, the line had been built as a light rail and still had overhead wires, level crossings, low platforms and lacked <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> <b>protection.</b> The upgrade allowed the metro to replace the aging T1300 trains with the new MX3000, and have longer six-car trains.|$|E

50|$|An <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> stop or ATS is {{a system}} on a train that {{automatically}} stops a train if certain situations occur (unresponsive train operator, earthquake, disconnected rail, train running over a stop signal, etc.) to prevent accidents. In some scenarios it functions {{as a type of}} dead man's switch. <b>Automatic</b> <b>train</b> stop differs from the concept of <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> Control in that ATS does not feature an onboard speed control mechanism.|$|R
25|$|The Great Western {{main line}} is {{currently}} equipped with colour light signalling {{common to the}} rest of the United Kingdom. At the time of the Ladbroke Grove rail crash (1999), the ATP (<b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> <b>Protection)</b> warning system was under trial. In response to that incident, it became a requirement for all First Great Western trains to be fitted with ATP.|$|E
25|$|The North South Line is {{currently}} equipped with Thales SelTrac® Communications-based train control (CBTC) moving block signalling system with Automatic train control (ATC) under Automatic train operation (ATO) GoA 3 (DTO).

25|$|The trains on the Barcelona–Vallès Line are {{currently}} the 112, 113 and 114 Series. There are {{a total of}} 66 electrical multiple units, {{all of which are}} disabled-accessible, air-conditioned and equipped with the <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> <b>protection</b> (ATP) security system. The trains are technically very similar, though the 112 Series are notably different than the 113 and 114 Series in their design. They all feature the colors of the Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya (FGC) logo—white and orange.|$|E
25|$|Automatic Train Operation {{controls}} trains so that, between stations, {{they will}} move {{at the speed}} specified by the <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> <b>protection</b> and automatic train supervision sub-systems. All Metro trains are manned by train operators who work the doors, make station announcements, and supervise the train. The train operator also can control whether the train operates in automatic mode or manual mode. From November 17, 1995 until January 6, 1996, Metro management required its employees to use the automatic mode at all times. During the Blizzard of 1996, however, there was a collision on January 6 that occurred when the ATS system failed to pick up proper instructions from the wayside communication system during a snowstorm, and defaulted to the highest speed. This speed would have been safe during dry weather, but because of ice or snow, trains required additional stopping distance, which was not provided for by the ATC system. From the June 2009 collision until 2015, Metrorail operators operated the trains exclusively in manual mode; the ATC system was restored to the Red Line in 2015. The <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> <b>protection</b> system still limits the maximum speed of every train that is in revenue service.|$|E

40|$|Even though <b>train</b> <b>protection</b> {{systems are}} used to avoid {{critical}} situations, the train driver remains responsible for the continuous monitoring of signal aspects and derivation of suitable actions. This requirement persists, although the position of signals shifts more and more from external signals to in-cab displays, especially with advanced levels of <b>train</b> <b>protection</b> and <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> control. Errors in the detection and interpretation of signal- or display information and driver distraction may lead to severe accidents. Aim of our research at the Institute of Transportation Systems (ITS) is to develop innovative concepts of the train driver’s workplace {{in order to secure}} a safe and efficient railway system that keeps the driver ‘in the loop’. Therefore, we follow a user centred approach. The train driver participates directly in the development and evaluation process of new systems supporting the work in the driver’s cabin. Using our driver’s cabin simulator recently built at the ITS as a flexible vehicle platform in a simulation environment, we are able to investigate the driving behaviour and the train driver’s information processing during his or her task. From the results, we derive concepts in order to optimize the presentation of necessary information and give recommendations how to assist the train driver. In the present paper, first concepts for supporting the train driver in keeping attention and also our simulation environment and the methodology used are described...|$|R
