5|$|In {{terms of}} sport, {{the use of}} poles for {{vaulting}} distances was recorded in Fierljeppen contests in the Frisian area of Europe, and vaulting for height was seen at gymnastics competitions in Germany in the 1770s. One of the earliest recorded pole vault competitions was in Cumbria, England in 1843. The basic rules <b>and</b> <b>technique</b> of the event originated in the United States. The rules required that athletes do not move their hands along the pole and athletes began clearing the bar with their feet first and twisting so that the stomach faces the bar. Bamboo poles were introduced in the 20th century and a metal box in the runway for planting the pole became standard. Landing mattresses were introduced in the mid-20th century to protect the athletes who were clearing increasingly greater heights.|$|E

Empirical data were collected from 74 companies in Czech Republic. For the data entry and processing data were used the Statictical package for the Social Science (SPSS). The study presents four groups of tools <b>and</b> <b>techniques</b> based on the perceived results of manager’s utilization and satisfaction. The most of the examined tools <b>and</b> <b>techniques</b> concentrated on the two groups: (1) power tools, this group include the tools <b>and</b> <b>techniques</b> with high level of utilization and high level of satisfaction; (2) rudimentary tools, which includes the tools <b>and</b> <b>techniques</b> with low satisfaction and low utilization. The Spearman rank order correlation coefficient was used to identify the relationship between utilization of strategic management tools <b>and</b> <b>techniques</b> <b>and</b> managerial awareness. The results provide essential information on the application of strategic management tools <b>and</b> <b>techniques,</b> <b>and</b> indicate the level of managerial awareness of strategic management tools <b>and</b> <b>techniques.</b> In addition the findings indicate a positive relationship between the utilization of strategic management tools <b>and</b> <b>techniques</b> <b>and</b> managerial awareness...|$|R

In this study, institutional and system theory are applied for examining the relationship amongst TQM, business performance, tools <b>and</b> <b>techniques.</b> The main contribution {{of this study is to}} explore the relationships of TQM, <b>and</b> tools <b>and</b> <b>techniques</b> as mediators, which effect to business performance. Qualitative study has been conducted in six companies in automotive industries. Respondents were asked about issue of the industry and TQM. In addition, they also were requested to assess TQM, business performance (BP), tools <b>and</b> <b>techniques</b> based on importance and practices. Spearman's rho was used to analyze correlation amongst them. This study result has identified ten constructs for TQM and six constructs for business performances. Furthermore, three tools <b>and</b> <b>techniques</b> namely statistical process control (SPC), total productive maintenance (TPM) and lean production are the most important tools <b>and</b> <b>techniques</b> in TQM implementation. Network diagram amongst the variable have been developed to understand the relationships. This study shows that there are significant correlation amongst TQM, tools <b>and</b> <b>techniques,</b> <b>and</b> business performance. TQM have strong correlation with tools <b>and</b> <b>techniques</b> (0. 714) <b>and</b> business performance (0. 928). Furthermore, tools <b>and</b> <b>techniques</b> have also positive correlation with business performance (0. 899). The result shows that business performance is accounted 87 % by TQM.

The literature provides a vast amount of tools <b>and</b> <b>techniques</b> created to help project managers to deal with project risks. However, in practice, project managers use few tools <b>and</b> <b>techniques.</b> The aim of this research is to understand the reasons for the non-use of PRM tools <b>and</b> <b>techniques</b> by project managers when dealing with risks in the Swedish manufacturing sector. In order to provide evidence on why project managers do not use PRM tools <b>and</b> <b>techniques,</b> this study identifies a list of tools <b>and</b> <b>techniques</b> to investigate, <b>and</b> a list of possible reasons. Both these lists derive from the existing literature and past research. This qualitative study is based on multiple case studies of seven companies with nine respondents. The companies are based in the Umeå region and operate in the manufacturing sector. This study has revealed that project managers, within the sample, prefer to use qualitative tools <b>and</b> <b>techniques</b> such as meetings and expert judgements when dealing with risks. On the contrary, most of the tools <b>and</b> <b>techniques</b> for quantitative risk analysis are not used. There is a lack of awareness regarding the existing tools <b>and</b> <b>techniques,</b> <b>and</b> in general regarding the basic concepts of Risk Management (RM). Project managers tend to heavily rely on intuition and past experience when dealing with project risks. Other reasons that account for the non-use of tools <b>and</b> <b>techniques</b> are lack of resources and an unwarranted use in relation to the project type. In some cases project managers might avoid or delay the management of negative risks and therefore to do not use tools <b>and</b> <b>techniques.</b> Furthermore, two more reasons emerge from the analysis of data, which contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the reasons behind the non-use of PRM tools <b>and</b> <b>techniques.</b> These reasons are small increment in quality of RM by using PRM tools <b>and</b> <b>techniques</b> <b>and</b> complacency by project managers when using PRM tools <b>and</b> <b>techniques.</b> This research extends prior literature by providing evidence on the use and non-use of PRM tools <b>and</b> <b>techniques</b> <b>and</b> the reasons for their non-use in a sector where there is a lack of research.

Sim came to conceive the series as a self-enclosed story, which itself would be divided into novels—or graphic novels, which were gaining in prominence in the North American comic book world in the 1980s and 1990s. While Sim and his partner Gerhard's technical achievements impressed and influenced his peers, Sim also spoke out for creators' rights, promoted his peers and up-and-coming creators, and fiercely promoted self-publishing as an ideal. Americans Jeff Smith with Bone and Terry Moore with Strangers in Paradise took Sim's cue, as did Canadian M'Oak (Mark Oakley) with his long-running Thieves and Kings.

At his direction an updated, comprehensive (460 pages) Armed Force Field Manual: Tactics <b>and</b> <b>Technique</b> FM 17–10 was written, published and distributed in March 1942. A German manual on tank platoon tactics, with a foreword by Heinz Guderian, was translated into English and issued as an Armored Force publication. March 1942 saw a reorganization of the armored divisions in the wake of the 1941 maneuvers. Devers added an artillery headquarters to the armored division, and reorganized the artillery component into three battalions, each of three batteries of six M7 Priest self-propelled guns. A division trains headquarters was added to coordinate logistical activities. In a first, at Devers' insistence, a flight of light aircraft to be used for artillery spotting and reconnaissance were included in the new Table of Organization and Equipment (TO) for each division. He was a strong and early supporter of the development of the DUKW, an amphibious truck. Vannevar Bush later recalled that in the early stages of its development, Devers was the only man in the Army who fully appreciated its possibilities. Its value would be demonstrated during the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943.|$|E
