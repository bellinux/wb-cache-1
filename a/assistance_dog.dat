5|$|The first ceremony, in November 2002, saw the Gold medal {{awarded to}} three dogs, {{including}} Endal, an <b>assistance</b> <b>dog</b> whose actions helped {{to save the}} life of his disabled owner. The most recent ceremony was held in June 2013, honouring Ajax, a German Shepherd. , the PDSA Gold Medal has been awarded 24 times.

40|$|<b>Assistance</b> <b>dogs</b> are {{specially}} trained {{to undertake a}} variety of tasks to help individuals with disabilities. This review gives {{an overview of the}} different types of <b>assistance</b> <b>dogs</b> in the UK, including guide dogs, hearing <b>dogs,</b> mobility <b>assistance</b> <b>dogs,</b> service dogs and dual purpose dogs. The literature describes many benefits of <b>assistance</b> <b>dogs,</b> including their impact on physical wellbeing and safety of their ‘owners,’ as well as on psychological wellbeing and social inclusion. The role of <b>assistance</b> <b>dogs</b> in society is widely recognized by the public, but is not currently acknowledged in government social policy. The current evidence on the benefits of <b>assistance</b> <b>dogs</b> is limited by the type and scale of current research. This article highlights the need for independent funding for high quality research to enable social care and policy makers to make evidence-based decisions on the value of <b>assistance</b> <b>dogs</b> to people with disabilities...|$|R

25|$|Another {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} designer dogs {{is that they are}} usually bred as companions and pets. Working and hunting dogs deliberately crossbred for a particular working purpose are not generally given portmanteau names; they are most often referred to by a type (not breed) name, such as Eurohounds (racing sled dogs) or Lurchers (hunting dogs). These dogs could be considered only as cross breeds, not as designer animals, since appearance is not the main reason for them to be bred. An exception to this is the Labradoodle, which although having a Portmanteau name, is often used as a Guide or <b>Assistance</b> <b>dog</b> as well as being popular family dogs.|$|E
500|$|Beagles {{are used}} as sniffer dogs for termite {{detection}} in Australia, and have been mentioned as possible candidates for drug and explosive detection. Because of their gentle nature and unimposing build, they are also frequently used in pet therapy, visiting the sick and elderly in hospital. In June 2006, a trained Beagle <b>assistance</b> <b>dog</b> was credited with saving the life of its owner after using her owner's mobile phone to dial an emergency number. [...] In {{the aftermath of the}} 2010 Haiti earthquake, a Beagle search and rescue dog with a Colombian rescue squad was credited with locating the owner of the Hôtel Montana, who was subsequently rescued after spending 100 hours buried in the rubble. Beagles were hired by New York City to help with bedbug detection, while the role of such dogs in this type of detection may have doubts.|$|E

50|$|Another {{piece of}} {{equipment}} similar to a cape is the harnesses that guide dogs and some mobility <b>assistance</b> <b>dogs</b> wear for leading, bracing, or pulling.

2500|$|Endal was a {{pedigree}} yellow Labrador retriever. From birth Endal {{suffered from}} the lifelong debilitating joint condition osteochondrosis in both of his front legs, [...] which brought his suitability for <b>assistance</b> <b>dog</b> training into question. However, due to Endal's intelligence and problem-solving abilities he qualified as a fully operational and accredited <b>assistance</b> <b>dog</b> although he was only part trained by the charity Canine Partners for Independence.|$|E
2500|$|Among other distinctions, Endal was {{described}} as [...] "the most decorated dog in the world" [...] (including [...] "Dog of the Millennium" [...] and the PDSA's Gold Medal for Animal Gallantry and Devotion to Duty, the highest award available to an animal) and possibly the most famous <b>assistance</b> <b>dog</b> in the UK,.

40|$|In the Czech Republic {{the guide}} dogs {{for the blind}} are {{recognized}} as a compensation tool and may be reimbursed up to 100 % of the cost; on the other hand, <b>assistance</b> <b>dogs</b> for people in a wheelchair, the deaf, deafblind, or other people with disabilities are not. This thesis explains the concepts of blind person and disabled person, and distinguishes among various types of service dogs. The {{costs and benefits of}} guide dogs on one hand, and of <b>assistance</b> <b>dogs</b> for people using a wheelchair on the other, are calculated and the results are compared; it is also examined, whether "favoring" guide dogs by means of providing government support on their acquisition is legitimate, and what it may be caused by. Further, the thesis calculates the maximum possible burden for the state budget if a support for <b>assistance</b> <b>dogs</b> is introduced. It also explores the possible effects {{of the impact of the}} introduction of this support on the markets for guide and <b>assistance</b> <b>dogs,</b> respectively...|$|R

The Golden Retriever is popular as a disability <b>assistance</b> <b>dog</b> {{such as being}} a guide dog for the blind and a hearing dog for the deaf. In addition, they are trained to be a hunting dog, a detection dog, and a search and rescue participant.

5000|$|In Australia, the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 protects all <b>assistance</b> <b>dog</b> handlers.

50|$|Many <b>assistance</b> <b>dogs</b> wear capes {{if nothing}} else than {{identification}} is needed.
