40|$|The {{application}} of the <b>attached</b> plane <b>jet</b> {{has proved to be}} an effective way to resolve the draught problem and to create a comfortable indoor environment. The objective of this thesis is to give a basis for improving the existing modelling and calculation method applied to predict the jet velocity in both ventilated and air-conditioned rooms using <b>attached</b> plane <b>jet</b> diffusers to avoid the draught problem. A special consideration is to set up models {{that could be used to}} predict the jet velocity along the surface more easily, more accurately and more efficiently than the existing methods under attachment and separation conditions. Jet velocity modelling and full-scale experimental measurement have been done to complete the above objectives. Through two measurement phases the whole flow field of the <b>attached</b> plane <b>jet</b> has been investigated experimentally in two full-scale test chambers. A large amount of data on jet velocity, temperature and turbulence intensity has been obtained; beyond that the visualization results are complementary to the understanding of turbulent buoyant jet characteristics. The results showed that: the superimposing model and the free convection velocity are capable of predicting the maximum air jet velocities along the wall under the conditions of the straight downward jet flow and the corner effect jet flow, respectively; the calculated corner-jet velocity profiles by the corner model obtained a good agreement with the measured results; the maximum velocity calculated by the model for the transition zone can be used to predict the maximum velocity decay. This work reveals that the turbulent <b>attached</b> plane <b>jet</b> behaves in a different way compared with the high Reynolds number turbulent jet in a ventilated and air-conditioned room. From the modelling viewpoint, the jet velocity models constructed here can be used to predict the maximum jet velocity decay and velocity profiles from the corner effect region in the indoor airflow studies.

Scrubbing noise was not radiated from portions of the surface adjacent to strong, locally coherent turbulent eddies. Instead, scrubbing noise seemed to come from weak loading fluctuations that were coherent along the scrubbed span. These loading fluctuations probably were induced by the convected large-scale vortex structure of the <b>attached</b> exhaust <b>jet.</b> Deflecting a UTW flap would reduce the distance between the vortex trajectory and the flap surface, increasing the resulting dipole noise and rotating its directivity.

40|$|International audienceBuoyant {{attached}} jets {{are widely}} used in various types of supply air devices especially in office buildings. This study focuses on a two-dimensional cooled <b>attached</b> <b>jet</b> characteristic, including mean flow field structure, specification of the jet regions and maximum velocity decay. A new superimposing model is derived to predict the maximum velocity decay and validated by measurement results. The measurement results demonstrate that the intermediate region of a buoyant jet does exist when an inner layer extends downstream of the jet slot. In addition, by assuming that the buoyant force is the main extra force on the jet flow in the acceleration process, the superimposing model predicted the maximum velocity decay with precise accuracy in a Reynolds number range of 667 - 4000, based on slot heights of 20 and 30 mm and slot velocities of 0. 50, 1. 00 and 2. 00 m/s. At a distance of 1000 mm from the slot, the velocity profile displays a self similarity character like an isothermal turbulent jet. In the final region, where the buoyancy flux completely dominates the jet, the jet behaved like a plume with an unstable flow field...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{confined}} jet studies {{have emphasized the}} behavior of non-buoyant jets inside ducts or near plane boundaries (Coanda effect). Buoyancy, however, {{is a major factor}} in the {{confined jet}} behavior experienced in many environmental fluid mechanics problems and, in particular, in the external fluid mechanics associated with an operating Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) plant. In many of these cases confinement and buoyancy offer opposing influences on jet trajectory and diffusion. An experimental set-up was designed, similar to some encountered in OTEC, but simple enough to facilitate accurate measurements and to allow the results to be interpreted through dimensional analysis. The particular experimental situation chosen was a submerged, negatively buoyant, horizontal, radial jet discharging into ambient water which was initially uniform in temperature and density. A near-surface intake was included in some experiments and not in others. Two distinct flow regimes were possible depending on the relative importance of buoyancy and confinement. The first flow regime (buoyancy-dominated) is termed a detached jet. The ambient region above the jet is an irrotational flow consisting entirely of original ambient fluid. The flow magnitude is determined by the entrainment requirements of the upper boundary of the jet and the intake flow, if any. The ambient region below the jet is made up of fluid pulled from the jet as it nears a vertical trajectory. The flow here is rotational and at a lower temperature than the original ambient fluid. The second flow regime (confinement-dominated) is termed an <b>attached</b> <b>jet.</b> Low pressures in the circulating region above the jet pull the jet to the surface. After impact the jet flow splits and no longer can be characterized as a jet. The portion of jet flow downstream from the impact point is negatively buoyant with respect to the original ambient fluid and therefore sinks - some returning as entrainment for the underside of the jet. In this case neither the top nor the bottom ambient region has the temperature of the original ambient water. Seventeen experiments yielded temperature and trajectory data on the radial jet in both of the flow regimes. Velocity data also were collected in the upper ambient region for the detached jet. Finally discharge conditions that caused transition from one flow regime to the other were determined. A hysterisis effect was noted as the conditions for "attaching" a detached jet were different from those needed to "detach" an <b>attached</b> <b>jet.</b> Dimensional analysis yielded a single dimensionless number that was fairly successful at predicting the transition points between regimes. However, three dimensionless numbers were apparently needed to completely characterize the experimental behavior. The dimensional analysis was also helpful in formulating an analytical jet model. An integral jet model (based on a spreading assumption) was successfully adapted to include effects of velocity and pressure fields in ambient regions. The model predicts jet trajectories, velocities, and temperatures, and transitions of experiments between flow regimes. The model can be applied to plane jets as well and buoyant and non-buoyant confined plane jet data from other studies were also compared with model predictions...|$|E
40|$|The flow {{structure}} of cold and ignited jets issuing into a co-flowing air stream was experimentally studied using a laser Doppler velocimeter. Methane was employed as the jet fluid discharging from circular and elliptic nozzles with aspect ratios varying from 1. 29 to 1. 60. The {{diameter of the}} circular nozzle was 4. 6 mm and the elliptic nozzles had approximately the same exit area {{as that of the}} circular nozzle. These non-circular nozzles were employed in order to increase the stability of <b>attached</b> <b>jet</b> diffusion flames. The time-averaged velocity and r. m. s. value of the velocity fluctuation in the streamwise and transverse directions were measured over the range of co-flowing stream velocities corresponding to different modes of flame blowout that are identified as either lifted or attached flames. On the basis of these measurements, attempts were made to explain the existence of an apparent optimum aspect ratio for the blowout of attached flames observed at higher values of co-flowing stream velocities. The insensitivity of the blowout limits of lifted flames to nozzle geometry observed in our previous work at low co-flowing stream velocities was also explained. Measurements of the fuel concentration at the jet centerline indicated that the mixing process was enhanced with the 1. 38 aspect ratio jet compared with the 1. 60 aspect ratio jet. On the basis of the obtained experimental data, it was suggested that the higher blowout limits of attached flames for an elliptic jet of 1. 38 aspect ratio was due to higher entrainment rates...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Flow and {{pressure}} {{in a short}} diffuser placed at exit of a plane turbulent jet have been studied. With connecting two ports in the diffuser by a duct, jet direction oscillates laterally. Flow pattern in the diffuser is visualized by smoke and instantaneous velocities {{and pressure}}s are measured by using hot-wire anemometers and semiconductor pressure transducers. Phased-locked ensemble averages of velocity and pressure are deduced to examine the detailed nature of the oscillatory flow. These measurements reveal that the <b>jet</b> <b>attaches</b> alternatively on both walls of the diffuser with keeping two-dimensionality. The detaching speed is much slower than the <b>attaching</b> one. The <b>jet</b> oscillation accompanies the vibration of port pressures and duct flow. By examining the results with fluid dynamics, it is clarified that the jet is bent by port pressure difference via lateral momentum equation without unsteady effect and the duct flow is driven by port pressure difference via unsteady duct flow equation. A flow model to govern the port pressure change is proposed, that is, the pressure {{is determined by the}} balance between jet entrainments and air supply. By combining these relationships, a closed feedback model of the oscillation is provided to explain flow mechanism of the oscillation...|$|R

40|$|After {{the annual}} {{maintenance}} period {{and during the}} refilling of the canal downstream of a regulator the tail water depth of this canal is small and not sufficient to produce a hydraulic jump inside the solid apron. This results in a severe local scour problem for the canal bed. A traditional solution of this problem is to place crushed rock in the scour hole to prevent further scour; however, this method has not {{proved to be a}} permanent solution. To investigate this local scour problem a physical model for a one vent regulator was constructed and a non-uniform granular material was used to simulate the canal bed. This experimental studies revealed that there are five distinct flow regimes in the region of the scour hole, namely: (1) a jet attached to the bed, (2) breaking wave and adverse hydraulic jump, (3) a travelling hydraulic jump, (4) wave jump and diving jet, and (5) surface jet with entrainment from below. The initial tests produced an asymmetrical scour hole; however, a midstream flow divider or vane, made the scour hole more symmetrical. Two depressions were observed inside most of the symmetrical scour holes. It was found that the scour hole that forms immediately after the apron, which {{is referred to as the}} short-term scour, reaches an equilibrium depth within a few minutes of the start of flow while the scour hole formed farther from the apron (long-term scour) continues to increase, at a decreasing rate for several days. The short-term scour in a rectangular channel is caused mainly by the <b>attached</b> <b>jet</b> while the short-term scour in a trapezoidal channel is produced by the jet attachment and the drilling effect of the vertical vortices caused by the sudden enlargement at the end of the control structure. The short-term scour in a rectangular channel is found to be a function of the initial Froude number, the initial jet depth and the particle size. The long-term scour depth is caused by the wave jet or diving jet as well as the surface jet; the scour depth was found to be a function of time, densimetric Froude number, initial jet depth and particle size. The changes in the surficial size distribution and settling velocity were determined for short-term and long-term scour at various locations within and downstream of the scour hole. The Gumbel distribution yields a good fit to both fall diameter and mass based equivalent diameter particle frequency distribution. As the scour hole develops, the D 50 decreases as does the ratio D 90 /D 10. An unsteady state short-term scour model was developed to predict the scour hole pattern and duration of phase 1 (<b>attached</b> <b>jet).</b> This model verified the rapid development of the short-term scour depth and reflected the observed effects of head, flow, and grain size. A steady state short-term scour model was developed to predict the scour hole dimensions immediately downstream of the apron. This model confirmed that the short-term scour depth is mainly a function of the initial Froude number, and initial jet depth, although it was found to be weakly dependent on the particle size. A theoretical consideration for the maximum long-term scour depth supports the concept that this depth is dependent on the densimetric Froude number, the jet expansion characteristics and the Shields constant.

Emphasis Is placed on the mechanism of breakaway, a phenomenon whereby the jet leaves the surface tangentially. An optical system based on the standard Z-type Schlieren configuration and capable of interferometric, Schlieren and shadowgraph techniques has been designed. The techniques are interchanged simply, a laser source being employed for Interferometry and a Xenon spark source for Schlieren and shadowgraph. Vibrations limit the interferometry and improvements are discussed. Shadowgraph and both spark and continuous Schlieren techniques gave good results. Total pressure traverses and surface oil flow visualization show that the influence of secondary flows on breakaway is small. Measurements of the coefficient of discharge show an increase both as the stagnation pressure Is Increased and as the slot width is reduced. The existence of a separation bubble has been established from surface static pressure measurements and shadowgraph and Schlieren photographs. Surface oil flow visualization shows a region of reversed flow withhin the bubble. The bubble grows as the stagnation pressure Is increased and eventually causes breakaway. A potential flow calculation method using the method of characteristics has been developed. Calculation of a fully <b>attached</b> <b>Jet</b> is inaccurate because the separation bubble is ignored.

40|$|Maintaining {{a healthy}} cabin {{environment}} during flight relies on continual extraction {{of fresh air}} from the engine. To meet passengers' expectation for more comfortable cabin which requires improved air supply and address the ever critical energy and emissions concerns, novel air delivery methods inside the cabin are desired and, therefore, of practical significance. This study explores the effectiveness of jet oscillation using active flow control to improve air delivery inside a cabin. The pulsed jet and synthetic jet are selected among the various control techniques to provide the control excitations on the air supply condition based on a detailed review of current practices of cabin ventilation. CFD simulation is employed as the major method of studying cabin airflow while hotwire measurement and flow visualization are made to validate the modelling of the synthetic jet. The fresh air jet entering the cabin is seen to oscillate about its injection angle when the supply flow rate experiences a series of sudden changes. Such oscillatory motion enhances air exchange and improves the ventilation performance. Lower temperature and CO 2 level are achieved under the pulsed supply conditions compared with the conventional steady supply conditions. Longer period of oscillation is maintained with proper modulation of the pulsed supply signal. The improvement of ventilation performance indicators reach up to 10 % when the supply signal turns periodic. A compact speaker driven actuator is designed to form the synthetic jet for redirecting the cabin ventilation jet, which provides a more direct way of inducing air oscillation inside the cabin. Due to the constraint of the cabin ceiling, a single synthetic jet acting as a pulling effect {{is not able to}} fully deflect the attached ventilation jet. A secondary synthetic jet oriented perpendicular to the ventilation jet can be added to push the <b>attached</b> <b>jet</b> off the ceiling and causes the formation of a merged jet at a downstream distance with a deflected jet direction.

We have observed three forms of the southward flow - a seasonally varying coastal countercurrent, an undercurrent <b>jet</b> <b>attached</b> to the Florida shelf, and an intermittent undercurrent on the Miami Terrace.

At the same time, no statistically significant seasonal cycle has been observed in the undercurrent flow on the Miami Terrace.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{directed}} toward {{the development of a}} bistable wall attachment Flip-Flop device which was capable of directionally controlling particle flow. The particles were transported by a fluid stream which under the influence of wall attachment. The dominant criteria {{in the development of the}} device was the achievement of the highest recovery of particles at the active output, without destroying the wall attachment of the fluid stream The experiment was conducted in several distinct stages; each of which was concerned with at least one aspect of wa 1 l attachment or particle flow. Results derived from one test were used to develop the criteria for the next experimental arrangement. Two experimental models were constructed: one of plywood with only one attachment wall, and one of plexiglas which had two attachment walls and was bistable. The plywood model was used in testing wall attachment and particle recovery as a function of the attachment wall angle. From these tests it was concluded that the optimum wall angle was 18 degrees from the center line of the device. Observations of particle action in the plywood model led to the incorporation of additional features in the plexiglas model. They were: an extended nozzle, the elimination of the separation bubble, and the development of smooth transitions at the corners. The plexiglas model was used to investigate optimum splitter location, the effect of jet velocity on recovery efficiency, the effect of vents on the performance of the device, and the performance of the device using a water jet. In the last stages of testing, moving parts and additional output features were used in conjunction with the bistable device to improve the collection efficiency. Some observations resulting from the data gathered in the various tests include: 1. The higher the jet velocity, the greater the wall attachment. 2. The higher the density and viscosity of the fluid stream the greater the recovery of particles at the active output. 3. Particles with large inertial forces were controlled less by the <b>attached</b> <b>jet</b> stream. The addition 0 f vents in the device may produce greater particle recovery. 5. The use of moving parts and variations in the output leg design can produce 100 percent particle recovery. This study indicated that it was possible to control the directional flow of particles with the bistable wall attachment device which was developed. However, the pure fluid bistable device could not achieve 100 percent recovery of particles. The addition of moving parts or variations in the output leg design can produce 100 percent recovery of the particles. The use of a bistable device could provide simplicity, reliability and adaptability in transporting materials for industrial processes...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} CFD {{predictions of}} gas turbine film and effusion cooling. The dearth of detailed experimental adiabatic effusion cooling data {{led to the}} validation of the computational procedures against the experimental adiabatic cooling effectiveness data for a single row of inclined round film cooling holes. This showed that the overall best agreement of the CFD predictions with experimental data was for the realizable k-e turbulence model with enhanced wall function. This was also shown to give good predictions of experimental results for trench outlet film cooling. This film cooling CFD work was extended. to demonstrate trench outlet lip geometries that could further improve the cooling effectiveness. The limitation of the CFD model was at higher blowing rates, M, when the film jet lifted off from the surface, where the CFD did not accurately predict the adiabatic cooling effectiveness close to the hole. For <b>attached</b> <b>jets</b> at lower M the agreement was good. The same CFD procedures were used for all the effusion cooling conjugate heat transfer (CHT) predictions. The hot metal wall effusion cooling experimental data base of Andrews and co-workers (1983 - 1995) was used to validate the CHT effusion cooling predictions. This database was for combustor flat wall cooling with mainly 90 ° injection holes. The overall effusion cooling effectiveness was measured and this required conjugate heat transfer CFD predictions. The adiabatic film cooling effectiveness was also predicted, by using a gas tracer in the cooling air and predicting its concentration at the effusion wall. For each effusion hole configuration, the coolant mass flow rate, G kg/srrr 2 bar, was varied from 0. 1 to 1. 5 and each G required a separate computation. The influence {{of the number of}} holes at a constant X!D of 4. 6 and the hole size at fixed X were investigated. The agreement between the predictions and experimental data was good. Finally, the influence of the effusion coolant jets flow direction to the hot-gas crossflow on effusion cooling performance was investigated. This included 30 ° inclined opposed-flow jets effusion wall, which was predicted to be the best effusion jets flow pattern. The addition of the filleted shape trench outlet to effusion cooling was predicted to improve the cooling performance with reduced coolant mass flow rate, due to the improved adiabatic film cooling.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{periodic}} excitation {{on the evolution}} of a turbulent jet were studied experimentally. A short, wide-angle diffuser was <b>attached</b> to the <b>jet</b> exit and excitation was introduced at the junction between the jet exit and the diffuser inlet. The introduction of high amplitude periodic excitation at the jet exit enhances the mixing and promotes attachment of the jet shear-layer to the diffuser wall. Vectoring is achieved by applying the excitation over a fraction of the circumference of the circular jet, enhancing its spreading rate on the excited side and its tendency to reattach to that side. Static deflection studies demonstrate that the presence of the wide-angle diffuser increases the effectiveness of the added periodic momentum due to a favorable interaction between the excitation, the jet shear-layer and the diffuser wall. This point was further demonstrated by the evolution of a wave packet that was excited in the jet shear-layer. Strong amplification of the wave packet was measured with a diffuser <b>attached</b> to the <b>jet</b> exit. The turbulent jet responds quickly (10 - 20 msec) to step changes in the level of the excitation input. The response scales with the jet exit velocity and is independent of the Reynolds number. Jet deflection angles were found to be highly sensitive to the relative direction between the excitation and the jet flow and less sensitive to the excitation frequency. The higher jet deflection angles were obtained for a diffuser length of about two diameters and for diffusers with half-angles greater than 15 degrees...|$|R

40|$|Glow {{discharge}} at {{atmospheric pressure}} using a dielectric barrier discharge can induce fluid flow, and operate as an actuator in flow control. In the present work, a modeling framework {{is presented to}} study the evolution and interaction of such athermal non-equilibrium plasma discharges in conjunction with low Mach number fluid dynamics. Under atmospheric pressure, the discharge can be simulated using a plasma-fluid instead of a kinetic model. The plasma and fluid species are treated as a two-fluid system coupled through force and pressure interactions, over a few decades of length and time scales. The multiple-scale processes such as convection, diffusion, and reaction/ionization mechanisms make the transport equations of the plasma dynamics stiff. To handle the stiffness, a sequential finite-volume operator-split algorithm capable of conserving space charge is employed. The fluid dynamics is solved using a pressure-based algorithm in a multi-block framework and can handle 3 -D curvilinear grids. A body force treatment is devised to link the plasma dynamics and fluid dynamics. The resulting body force field can improve a previously proposed analytical-empirical treatment. The outcome of the body force field on the fluid flow is an <b>attached</b> wall <b>jet</b> type flow capable of modifying the near wall flow structures...|$|R
