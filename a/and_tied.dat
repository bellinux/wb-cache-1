40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the application of}} a Strut <b>and</b> <b>Tie</b> model for the analysis of engineered CrossLaminated Timber panels, CLT. A Strut <b>and</b> <b>Tie</b> approach is used for "deep beams" with low span to depth ratios and has advantages for modelling materials with different properties in tension and compression plus accounting for anisotropic behaviour. The development of this model is considered for the analysis of CLT panels by determining the definition of a deep beam in this context and evaluating the effect of the grain angle. The behaviour of CLT at different timber grain angles demonstrate a complex composite behaviour influencing the strut <b>and</b> <b>tie</b> capacities. The direction of the timber grain angle is critical to the definitions of the struts <b>and</b> <b>ties</b> <b>and</b> therefore the capacity of the sections. The results from the experimental testing show that beam theory is unsuitable for beams with S/D ratio less than 3 and demonstrates there is some application in a Strut <b>and</b> <b>Tie</b> method for these "deep beams"...|$|R
