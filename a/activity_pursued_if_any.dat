40|$|The primary {{objectives}} {{of this analysis}} are to: articulate clearly the central premises {{of each of the}} theories of punishment (retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation) and, to explore the policy implications that flow from each of the justifications. The differences among the theoretical justifications of punishment range from obvious to extremely subtle. This analysis clearly delineates the differing premises of the theories that underlie criminal justice. Attention then turns to the policies that would be <b>pursued</b> <b>if</b> <b>any</b> one of the justifications of punishment were used as the primary basis of the criminal justice system. The major conclusion is that the poli cies derived from the competing theories lead in divergent and often contradictory directions. Finally, bureaucratic accommodations such as plea bargaining are explored in terms of their relationship to the theories of punishment. It is contended that plea bargaining and failure to prosecute multiple charges tend to run counter to all of the justifications of the criminal sanction. The failure to address the policies of criminal justice with reference to the theories of punishment means that the system will have great difficulty achieving any particular goals...|$|R
40|$|The current {{empirical}} study {{aimed to}} identify those categories of reading strategies (cognitive, meta-cognitive, and compensation) that are mostly used by Iranian EFL learners, and investigate <b>if</b> there is <b>any</b> significant relationship between critical thinking ability and reading strategies used by these learners. It also <b>pursued</b> <b>if</b> there is <b>any</b> significant difference between critical thinking ability {{of male and female}} learners. Seventy five Iranian EFL senior students (35 males and 40 females) majoring in English Literature and EnglishTranslation at the University of Sistan and Baluchestan in Iran participated in this study. Based on the purposes of the study, two questionnaires were administered to the participants: a critical thinking questionnaire and a reading strategy questionnaire. Results of the study showed that the most frequently used reading strategy was meta-cognitive strategy. Statistical analyses revealed a low positive significant correlation between learners’ critical thinking ability and their overall use of reading strategies. The participants’ critical thinking ability also correlated positively with their use of each one of cognitive, meta-cognitive, and compensation strategies. An independent-samples t -test was employed to examine the difference between critical thinking ability of males and females and the result revealed a significant difference between male and female learners in their critical thinking; males’ critical thinking ability was higher than that of females. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of exchange controls in 1978 and {{the exchange rate}} uncertainty associated with Ireland 2 ̆ 7 s entry into the European Monetary System (EMS) in 1979 {{gave rise to the}} possibility of a reduction in the degree of capital mobility between Irish and foreign financial markets and as a consequence a greater autonomy in the conduct of Irish monetary policy. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to evaluate Irish monetary policy in terms of a pre- and post-EMS entry framework by estimating an adaptation of Kouri and Porter 2 ̆ 7 s (1974) portfolio balance model of an open economy.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade a number of Internet-based multi-sided {{platforms}} have emerged that provide free services to, in some cases, millions of businesses. More such platforms are being spawned as the Internet-based economy grows. This Article argues that under current norms in adversarial proceedings, such as those involving competition policy, these platforms are likely to face large numbers of complaints in multiple jurisdictions, a substantial likelihood {{that at least one}} of these complaints will result in a false-positive decision against the platform, and material risk of a false-positive decision that results in catastrophic consequences. These effects result from a combination of business users of free services receiving a free litigation option they can <b>pursue</b> <b>if</b> they have <b>any</b> complaints; an adverse-selection problem that results from free services being particularly attractive to start-ups that do not have or want to invest capital in their businesses; and the sheer number of free-business users resulting in a high cumulative probability of at least one false-positive decision. After documenting these phenomena, this Article argues that government policymakers, including competition authorities and courts, should adopt a heightened level of scrutiny concerning complaints from free business users. This heightened level of scrutiny is necessary to counteract the impact of excessive litigation on innovation by multi-sided platforms...|$|R
