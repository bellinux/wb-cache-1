[...] "I was so exhausted because of everything", she later said, [...] "that <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was sleep."

It wasn't quite <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> but I'd a notion that I could make my pile and then let myself go. It took me some years to get things straight, the pile was harder to make than I reckoned, and your mother had a use for all the money I could raise.
