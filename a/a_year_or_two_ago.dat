5000|$|Dorothy _____ {{believed}} to have been the maidservant of Governor John Carver. They married about 1621-1622. She died <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> after the marriage - ca. 1624.

60|$|I gave {{a lecture}} to the Eton boys <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago,</b> on {{little more than}} the shepherd's dog, which is yet more {{wonderful}} in magnified scale of photograph. The lecture is partly published--somewhere, but I can't refer to it.|$|E

"I believe," [...] said Gerald, [...] "that {{he joined}} the Wills-of-the-Wisp, that company which was got up by Sir Lewis Willingham, and played at Devereux Castle <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago.</b> Some one {{told me they were}} wonderfully {{effective}} for amateurs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense," [...] said Mrs Neverbend; [...] "are {{you going}} to send the poor boy to break his neck among the glaciers? Don't you {{remember}} that Dick Ardwinkle was lost there <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago,</b> and came to his death in a most frightful manner?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And so I {{thanked her}} and went. She was {{certainly}} a very remarkable woman. <b>A</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago</b> I heard that her father Nala was dead, {{and that she had}} succeeded to the chieftainship of both tribes, which she ruled with great justice and firmness.|$|E
6000|$|... “Quite {{right of}} her,” said Mrs. Yonelet with vague approval; “it’s what any girl of spirit would have done. Still, that was <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago,</b> I believe; Bertie is older now, {{and so is}} Teresa. Naturally she must be anxious to see him settled.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No doubt," [...] replied Donatello,--"but I {{know little}} of such things, and never could {{comprehend}} the interest {{which some of}} you Forestieri take in them. <b>A</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago</b> an English signore, with a venerable white beard--they say he was a magician, too--came hither from as far off as Florence, just to see my tower." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "So be it, sir, I will go; but first, as {{an honest}} man and my father's friend, and, as I thought, my own, answer me one question. Why have you changed your tune to me of late? Am I not the same Christopher Harflete I was <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago?</b> And have I done aught to lower me in the world's eye or in yours?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{so you see}} {{you might}} as well have done it <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago</b> when perhaps things would have been simpler. Well, it is a fine example of the vanity of human plans, and, Alan, we must be going home to lunch. If we don't, Sir Robert will be {{organizing}} a search party to look for us; in fact, I shouldn't wonder if he is doing that already, in the wrong direction." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{but he will}} be so angry. When that lot of fellows <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago</b> did {{something}} like it, and shot some of the Abbotstoke rabbits, don't you remember how much he said about its being disgraceful, and ordering us never {{to have anything to}} do with their gunnery? And he will think it so very bad to have gone out on a lark just now! Oh, I wish I hadn't done it." ...|$|E

60|$|I was {{reminded}} of Jack because I came across a letter to-day which is over thirty years old that Jack wrote. Jack was doomed to consumption. He was very long and slim, poor creature; and in <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> after he got back from that excursion, to the Holy Land he went on a ride on horseback through Colorado, {{and he did not}} last but <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b>|$|R

6000|$|We {{were all}} {{assembled}} shortly before dinner, {{and he was}} still at the piano idly picking out in his luxurious way little strains of music, and talking between whiles of finishing some sketches of the ruined old Verulam wall to-morrow, which he had begun <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago</b> and had got tired of, when a card was brought in and my guardian read aloud in a surprised voice, [...] "Sir Leicester Dedlock!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{must say}} I {{thought that was}} a nasty story <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago</b> about the man who said he had stolen jewels," [...] said Cei. [...] "It got hushed up somehow; but I {{remember}} Piero di Cosimo said, at the time, he believed there was something in it, for he saw Melema's face when the man laid hold of him, and he never saw a visage so `painted with fear,' as our sour old Dante says." ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{might have}} {{extended}} this chapter {{to a much}} greater length--we might have carried the comparison into the liberal professions--we might have shown, as was in fact our original purpose, that each is in itself a little pantomime with scenes and characters of its own, complete; but, as we fear we have been quite lengthy enough already, we shall leave this chapter just where it is.

60|$|Now {{there is}} no real {{difficulty}} about teaching drill and the simpler kinds of gymnastics. It is done admirably well, for example, in the North Surrey Union schools; and <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago</b> when I had an opportunity of inspecting these schools, I was greatly struck with the effect of such training upon the poor little waifs and strays of humanity, mostly picked out of the gutter, who are being made into cleanly, healthy, and useful members of society in that excellent institution.|$|E
60|$|Remembering {{what you}} do of Sunderland, you will be {{surprised}} that our profit there was very considerable. I read in a beautiful new theatre, and (I thought to myself) quite wonderfully. Such an audience I never beheld for rapidity and enthusiasm. The room in which we acted (converted into a theatre afterwards) was burnt to the ground <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago.</b> We found the hotel, so bad in our time, really good. I walked from Durham to Sunderland, and from Sunderland to Newcastle.|$|E
60|$|I {{had often}} {{spent a day}} walking with John Synge, but <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago</b> I {{travelled}} for a month alone through the west of Ireland with him. He was the best companion for a roadway any one could have, always ready and always the same; a bold walker, up hill and down dale, {{in the hot sun}} and the pelting rain. I remember a deluge on the Erris Peninsula, where we lay among the sand hills and at his suggestion heaped sand upon ourselves to try and keep dry.|$|E
