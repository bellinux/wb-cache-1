40|$|Feed {{additives}} {{need to be}} authorised to {{be placed}} on the market according to Regulation (EU) No 1831 / 2003. Next to laying down the procedural requirements the Regulation creates the European Union Reference Laboratory for Feed Additives (EURL-FA) and requires applicants to send samples to the EURL-FA. Once authorised the characteristics of the marketed feed additives should correspond to those deposited in the sample bank of the EURL-FA. For this purpose the submitted samples were subjected to near infrared (NIR) and Raman spectroscopy for spectral characterisation. These techniques have the valuable potential of characterising the feed additives in a non-destructive manner without any complicated sample preparation. This paper describes the capability of spectroscopy for a rapid characterisation of products to establish whether specific <b>authorisation</b> <b>criteria</b> are met. The study presented in this paper is based on the analysis of feed additive samples from different categories and functional groups, namely products containing (1) selenium (2) zinc and manganese, (3) vitamins, and (4) essential oils such as oregano and thyme oil. The use of chemometrics turned out to be crucial, especially in cases where the differentiation of spectra by visual inspection was very difficult. JRC. F. 5 -Food and Feed Complianc...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTPurposeThe Digital Service File (DSA) is the RAG {{intranet}} portal for {{the long-term}} application of geodata and other data sources. It combines the functionality of modern mapping services designed for spatial analysis and display with a searching service that includes full-text searches of various data containers held by technical departments. The DSA is available as a web application to all employees of the RAG Group {{on the basis of}} existing <b>authorisation</b> <b>criteria.</b> MethodsThe system uses GIS and search technologies that are now routinely employed by RAG (Esri ArcGIS and MOSS – Microsoft Office Sharepoint Server). The web interface is based around the Microsoft Silverlight application framework. Since the system's successful launch in 2011 the DSA has been continuously augmented with additional key components. ResultsUsers can now employ DSA 2. 0 to access the RAG drawings archive containing more than 100, 000 mine drawings and plans as well as the RAG aerial photograph archive, which also has more than 100, 000 aerial records. Practical implicationsThe incorporation of various general components, such as personalisation (myDSA), high-quality map output, the linking of additional data containers in SAP and ELO and the integration of special, process-supporting "tasks" (e. g. mining subsidence processing), is now leading to the more widespread use of the DSA system. Originality/valueThe DSA is an indispensable tool which will continue to support and reproduce core processes in the future...|$|E

40|$|The article {{analyses}} {{the procedural}} requirements that authorities must fulfil when granting authorisation for new electricity generating capacity according to Article 7 {{of the electricity}} directive 2009 / 72 /EB. Pursuant to the provisions of Article 7 Member States must publish the authorisation procedure and the <b>criteria</b> for granting <b>authorisations.</b> The <b>criteria</b> must be objective, transparent and nondiscriminatory. The article asks what these requirements entail and whether they meet the intended purpose to ensure access to generating activities and free competition. It argues that the rules are too general and do {{not take into account}} the differing and complex procedures in the Member States and the diverse nature of electricity generation plants...|$|R
40|$|The Energy Efficiency Directive (EED), adopted on 4 December 2012, {{establishes}} {{a set of}} binding measures to help the EU reach its 20 % energy efficiency target by 2020. Under the Directive, all EU countries are required to use energy more efficiently at all stages of the energy chain from its production to its final consumption. Member States were required to translate the EED into national law by 5 June 2014. The EED will repeal the existing Cogeneration Directive (2004 / 8 /EC) and the Energy End-Use Efficiency and Energy Services Directive (2006 / 32 /EC) as of 5 June 2014. Article 14 (5) of the EED requires Member States to ensure that thermal electricity generation installations and industrial installations exceeding 20 MWth, carry out a cost-benefit analysis when they are planned or substantially refurbished to assess whether the use of high-efficiency cogeneration, the connection to a district heating or cooling network or other means of waste heat recovery would be cost-effective. The obligation to carry-out a cost-benefit analysis also applies to new district heating and cooling networks, when those are planned or when an energy production installation with a capacity exceeding 20 MWth is planned or substantially refurbished within those networks, {{in order to assess}} whether the utilisation of waste heat from a nearby industrial installation is cost-effective. If the benefits exceed the costs, the options analysed in the cost-benefit analysis must be included in the <b>authorisation</b> or permit <b>criteria.</b> The cost-benefit analysis has to be in accordance with the general methodological principles set out in Part 2 of Annex IX. A possible methodology for conducting a Cost Benefit-Analysis (CBA) in accordance with Article 14 (5) and Part 2 of Annex IX of the Energy Efficiency Directive is presented here. The methodology takes into account the Guidance note prepared by the Commission for the implementation of Article 14, including the carrying out of the cost-benefit analysis by individual installations and district heating and cooling networks.
