Concepts known for single-valued functions, in particular concepts of convergence, continuity, derivative, differentiability, indefinite and definite integrals are generalized on multiple-valued functions. A link between multiple-valued <b>and</b> divergent <b>functions</b> is found. Transformation particularities of single-valued functions into multiple-valued <b>functions</b> <b>and</b> multiple-valued <b>functions</b> into single-valued ones are researched...|$|R
