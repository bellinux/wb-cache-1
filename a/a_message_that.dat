5|$|At 07:15 Admiral Nagumo {{ordered the}} B5Ns still on Kaga and Akagi rearmed with bombs for another attack on Midway itself. This process was {{limited by the}} number of {{ordnance}} carts used to handle the bombs and torpedoes and the limited number of ordnance elevators. Thus, the torpedoes could not be struck below until after all the bombs were moved up from their magazine, assembled and mounted on the aircraft. This process normally took {{about an hour and a}} half; more time would be required to bring the aircraft up to the flight deck and warm up and launch the strike group. Around 07:40 Nagumo reversed his order when he received <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>that</b> American carriers had been spotted. At 07:30 Kaga recovered three of her CAP.|$|E
5|$|Controversy {{surrounds}} the breakout {{before the last}} stand—which various writers have posited might have actually been desertion—and a box of gold sovereigns, which a Matabele inDuna (leader) later claimed {{had been given to}} two unidentified men from Forbes's rear guard on 2 December, along with <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>that</b> Lobengula admitted defeat and wanted the column to stop pursuing him. Two batmen were initially found guilty of accepting the gold, keeping it for themselves and not passing on the message, but the evidence against them was inconclusive and largely circumstantial; the convictions were ultimately overturned.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Spaceman tells Tracy {{that he is}} dating Squeaky Fromme {{and says}} {{that she is a}} handful. Fromme {{is a member of the}} Manson Family, and was sentenced to life {{imprisonment}} for attempting to assassinate United States President Gerald Ford in 1975. Jenna and Danny begin arguing after the two are forced to share a dressing room. She takes down Danny's poster of the Montreal Alouettes, a Canadian Football League team based in Montreal, Quebec, which was signed by Marc Trestman, the head coach of the Alouettes. Jenna says that she took down the poster because it was tacky, as are his mother's chain e-mails (<b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>that</b> attempts to induce the recipient to make a number of copies of the letter and then pass them on to as many recipients as possible).|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} {{hour of the}} fire it spread onto the 23rd and 24th floors. Heavy smoke was {{building}} up in the stairwells and a captain and two firefighters from Engine 11 were assigned {{to go to the}} top level to ventilate the stairwell. The three firefighters went up a center staircase from the 22nd floor and soon radioed that they were disoriented by heavy smoke on the 30th floor. There were attempts to direct the firefighters through the radio, and soon after the captain requested permission to break a window for ventilation, which was followed by <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>that</b> the captain was down. Permission to break the window was given and a search and rescue effort was initiated.|$|E
5|$|POV (point of view) {{shots were}} done with the Tiger Moth biplane. During one such time {{at the end of}} summer, by which time the grass around Booker Airfield had turned brown, members of the effects team {{rectified}} the colour by applying green paint. Some time later, the production team received <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>that</b> a furious farmer's prize ram (an uncastrated sheep) had died, and when the animal was cut open, there was a large amount of green paint inside it. Concluding that no one else but them were responsible for the death, the production team did a lot of explaining and funded the cost of the incident. Production manager Norman Foster gave the farmer's wife a big bunch of flowers.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 22nd century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the first Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise, registration NX-01. In this episode, several cybernetically enhanced aliens are accidentally reanimated by a research team in the Arctic. The aliens assimilate the researchers and their ship before escaping into space. The Enterprise pursues the ship and is attacked, forcing Archer to destroy the vessel. Afterwards they discover that the aliens sent a message into the Delta Quadrant containing the coordinates of Earth, <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>that</b> will not arrive until the 24th century.|$|E

5|$|By 11 a.m., it {{was clear}} that a {{breakthrough}} was not forthcoming and the advances by Sherman and McPherson were failures. Just then, Grant received a message from McClernand, which stated that he was heavily engaged, the Confederates were being reinforced, and he requested a diversion on his right from McPherson's corps. Grant initially refused the request, telling McClernand to use his own reserve forces for assistance; Grant was mistakenly under the impression that McClernand had been lightly engaged and McPherson heavily, although the reverse was true. McClernand followed up with <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>that</b> was partially misleading, implying that he had captured two forts"The Stars and Stripes are flying over them."—and that another push along the line would achieve victory for the Union Army. Although Grant once again demurred, he showed the dispatch to Sherman, who ordered his own corps to advance again. Grant, reconsidering, then ordered McPherson to send Quinby's division to aid McClernand.|$|E
5|$|During {{the day on}} September 3, KMAG {{advisers}} at P'ohang-dong sent Coulter <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>that</b> the ROK 3rd Division commander {{was preparing}} to withdraw from P'ohang-dong. Coulter went immediately to the ROK I Corps commander and had him order ROK 3rd Division would not withdraw. Coulter checked every half-hour {{to see that the}} division stayed in its P'ohang-dong positions. That night, September 3–4, the remainder of the ROK I Corps front collapsed. Three North Korean T-34 tanks overran a battery of ROK artillery and then scattered two battalions of the newly arrived ROK 5th Regiment. Following a mortar preparation, the North Koreans entered An'gang-ni at 02:20. An hour later the command post of the Capital Division withdrew from the town and fighting became increasingly confused. By 0400 American tanks ceased firing because remnants of the Capital Division had become intermingled with North Korean forces. At daylight, G Company, US 21st Infantry, discovered that it was alone in An'gang-ni, nearly surrounded by the North Koreans. ROK troops had disappeared. At 18:10, G Company withdrew from the town and dug in along the road eastward near the rest of the 2nd Battalion, 21st Infantry at the bridge over the Hyongsan-gang. North Koreans held the town and extended southward along the railroad.|$|E
5|$|Meena then realises {{that she}} has {{fallen in love with}} Rahul. When Rahul plans to sneak away, she argues, not wanting to earn the villagers' distrust. Tangaballi catches Rahul as he tries to leave, but the villagers help them escape again. Meena persuades Rahul to {{disperse}} his grandfather's ashes and travels with him to Rameswaram, where they complete the rites. On their way back, Rahul realises that he has fallen in love with Meena, and does not tell her where they are going. He takes Meena back to her father and tries to make him understand and honour his daughter's wish. He also tells Meena that he loves her. Rahul tells Tangaballi and his goons that he is ready for the fight this time. In the fight that follows, Rahul is severely injured but emerges victorious. Meena's father and Tangaballi reform, accepting that the love of a common man like Rahul is bigger than their physical ability and political influence. Azhagusundaram allows Rahul to marry Meena. Rahul then leaves <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>that</b> love knows no regional or language barriers and that with a strong heart, there is no limit to what the common man can achieve.|$|E

5|$|Some {{weeks after}} their encounter, word reached Le Gris of accusations being made against him by Carrouges and his wife. It {{will never be}} known what basis these {{allegations}} had in fact but Carrouges claimed that on 18 January 1386, whilst Carrouges was still in Paris, Le Gris had entered the chateau of Carrouges' mother Nicole and there raped Marguerite. According to Marguerite de Carrouges' testimony, a squire in Le Gris' employ named Adam Louvel had {{knocked on the door}} of the chateau and demanded entry. All the servants were attending to Dame Nicole de Carrouges, who was visiting a neighbouring town on legal business, and so Marguerite was alone when Louvel called. Once inside, Louvel gave Marguerite <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>that</b> Le Gris was outside and desired to see her because he was passionately in love with her. Although Marguerite protested, Le Gris broke into the house and propositioned her, offering money in exchange. When Marguerite refused, Le Gris attempted to take her by force and raped her on the bed in her chamber with the help of Louvel. As Le Gris departed, he threatened her with violence if she told of the encounter.|$|E
5|$|The {{restrictions}} against royalist {{candidates and}} voters were widely ignored, and the elections {{resulted in a}} House of Commons that was fairly evenly divided on political grounds between Royalists and Parliamentarians and on religious grounds between Anglicans and Presbyterians. The new so-called Convention Parliament assembled on 25 April 1660, and soon afterwards welcomed the Declaration of Breda, in which Charles promised lenience and tolerance. There would be liberty of conscience and Anglican church policy would not be harsh. He would not exile past enemies nor confiscate their wealth. There would be pardons for nearly all his opponents except the regicides. Above all, Charles promised to rule in cooperation with Parliament. The English Parliament resolved to proclaim Charles king and invite him to return, <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>that</b> reached Charles at Breda on 8 May 1660. In Ireland, a convention had been called earlier in the year, and had already declared for Charles. On 14 May, he was proclaimed king in Dublin.|$|E
5|$|The series {{premiere of}} The Playboy Club was {{initially}} broadcast on September 19, 2011 in the United States on NBC. It was watched by 5.02 million viewers, despite airing simultaneously with Hawaii Five-0 on CBS and Castle on ABC. That {{was the lowest}} viewership among the major networks in its 10 p.m. timeslot, with Castle drawing 13.28 million households and Hawaii Five-0 attaining 12.19 million households. The episode gradually shed viewers from the first half to the next, {{with an average of}} 5.36 million households tuning in for the first half-hour and an average of 4.69 million households for the second. The debut earned a 1.6 rating/4 share among viewers in the 18-49 demographic, according to the Nielson ratings, indicating it was viewed by four percent of those in the demographic who were actively watching television during the broadcast, which represented 1.6 percent of the total demographic. This was considered a disappointing result for a coveted demographic. Speculations regarding the possible cancelation of the series immediately surfaced, but NBC officials told Deadline.com that such a decision would not be rushed because NBC Chairman Bob Greenblatt wanted to send <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>that</b> the network was willing to give all their new shows the necessary time to find an audience and succeed. Similarly in Canada, the pilot episode was viewed by 485,000 viewers.|$|E

5|$|This {{conference was}} {{followed}} by an eight-hour meeting in October 1915 at Paghman and more audiences at Kabul. The message {{was the same as}} at the first audience. The meetings would typically begin with Habibullah describing his daily routine, followed by words from von Hentig on politics and history. Next the discussions veered towards Afghanistan's position on the propositions of allowing Central Powers troops the right of passage, breaking with Britain, and declaring independence. The expedition members expected a Persian move to the Central side, and held out on hopes that this would convince the Emir to join as well. Niedermayer argued that German victory was imminent; he outlined the compromised and isolated position Afghanistan would find herself in if she was still allied to Britain. At times the Emir met with the Indian and German delegates separately, promising to consider their propositions, but never committing himself. He sought concrete proof that the Turco-German assurances of military and financial assistance were feasible. In a letter to Prince Henry of Reuss in Tehran (<b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>that</b> was intercepted and delivered to the Russians instead), von Hentig asked for Turkish troops. Walter Röhr later wrote to the prince that a thousand Turkish troops armed with machine guns—along with another German expedition headed by himself—should be able to draw Afghanistan into the war. Meanwhile, Niedermayer advised Habibullah on how to reform his army with mobile units and modern weaponry.|$|E
