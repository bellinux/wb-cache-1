40|$|This {{investigation}} expands {{and improves}} {{the procedure for}} deter-mining median travel distance of wind in traversing a field, infor-mation used in solving the wind-erosion equation. Wind-erosion roses were simulated by the equation of an ellipse in polar coordinates. The ratio of semimajor axis to semiminor axis was varied to give preponderance values from 1. 0 to 4. 0. The axis was rotated to sim-ulate field orientation from 0 to 90 " relative to prevailing wind-erosion direction. Length/width ratio for rectangular fields was var-ied from 1 to 10. The wind-erosion direction factor, a number that when multiplied by field width gives median travel distance, was calculated for many combinations of variables. When preponderance was 1. 0, the wind-erosion direction factor was 1. 03, 1. 42, 1. 48, and 1. 48 for rectangular fields with length/width ratios of 1, 2, 4, and 10, respectively; the factor was not influenced by field orientation. As preponderance increased, the wind-erosion direction factor ap-proached unity for small <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>deviation</b> and approached the length/width ratio for large <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>deviation.</b> For circular fields surrounded by a nonerodible surface, the wind-erosion direction fac-tor was 0. 91, regardless of wind direction and preponderance.

Another halo variety often seen together with sun dogs is the 22° halo, which forms a ring at roughly the same angular distance from the sun as the sun dogs, thus appearing to interconnect them.

50|$|Congenital esotropia, or {{infantile}} esotropia, is {{a specific}} sub-type of primary concomitant esotropia. It is a constant esotropia of large and consistent size with onset between birth and six months of age. It is not associated with hyperopia, so the exertion of accommodative effort will not significantly affect the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>deviation.</b> It is, however, associated with other ocular dysfunctions including oblique muscle over-actions, Dissociated Vertical Deviation (DVD,) Manifest Latent Nystagmus, and defective abduction, which develops {{as a consequence of}} the tendency of those with infantile esotropia to 'cross fixate.' Cross fixation involves the use of the right eye to look to the left and the left eye to look to the right; a visual pattern that will be 'natural' for the person with the large angle esotropia whose eye is already deviated towards the opposing side.|$|E
50|$|The Maddox rod {{test can}} be used to subjectively detect and measure a latent, manifest, {{horizontal}} or vertical strabismus for near and distance. The test is based on the principle of diplopic projection. Dissociation of the deviation is brought about by presenting a red line image to one eye and a white light to the other, while prisms are used to superimpose these and effectively measure the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>deviation</b> (horizontal and vertical). The strength of the prism is increased until the streak of the light passes through the centre of the prism, as the strength of the prism indicates the amount of deviation present. The Maddox rod is a handheld instrument composed of red parallel plano convex cylinder lens, which refracts light rays so that a point source of light is seen as a line or streak of light. Due to the optical properties, the streak of light is seen perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder.|$|E

50|$|The spatial QRS-T angle (SA) {{is derived}} from a vectorcardiogram, which is a {{three-dimensional}} representation of the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) created with a computerized matrix operation. The SA is the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>deviation</b> between two vectors; the spatial QRS-axis representing all of the electrical forces produced by ventricular depolarization and the spatial T-axis representing all the electrical forces produced by ventricular repolarization. The SA {{is indicative of the}} difference in orientation between the ventricular depolarization and repolarization sequence. In healthy individuals, the direction of ventricular depolarization and repolarization is relatively reversed; this creates a sharp SA. There is high individual variability and gender difference in the magnitude of the SA. The mean, normal SA in healthy young adult females and males is 66° and 80°, respectively, and very similar magnitudes are found in the elderly population (65 years and older). In ECG analysis, the SA is categorized into normal (below 105°), borderline abnormal (105-135°) and abnormal (greater than 135°). A broad SA results when the heart undergoes pathological changes and is reflected in a discordant ECG. A large SA indicates an altered ventricular repolarization sequence, and {{may be the result of}} structural and functional myocardial changes that induce regional shortening in action potential duration and impaired ion channel functioning. Current standard ECG markers of repolarization abnormalities include ST depression, T wave inversion and QT prolongation. Many studies have investigated the prognostic strength of the SA for cardiac morbidity and mortality compared to these and other ECG parameters. In treated hypertensive patients, the SA was significantly larger in patients with elevated blood pressure compared to those with lower blood pressure values and a discrimination between patients with high and low blood pressure could not be detected using other ECG parameters. In the Rotterdam Study with men and women aged 55 years and older, having an abnormal SA significantly increased the hazard ratios for cardiac death, sudden cardiac death, non-fatal cardiac events (infarction, coronary interventions) and total mortality. Independently, the SA was a stronger risk indicator of cardiac mortality compared to the other cardiovascular and ECG risk factors analyzed. The Women’s Health Initiative study concluded that a wide SA was the strongest predictor for incident coronary heart failure risk and a dominant risk factor for all cause mortality compared to several other ECG parameters. The SA also increases accuracy of diagnosing left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Using only conventional ECG criteria to diagnose LVH the diagnostic accuracy was 57%, however the inclusion of the SA significantly improved the diagnostic accuracy to 79%.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aims of {{this study}} were to compare <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>deviation,</b> fusional vergence {{measurements}} and fusion reserve ratio between esophoria and exophoria. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed in children with best-corrected visual acuity of 0. 0 LogMAR in either eye, compensated heterophoria within 10 prism dioptres (PD), full ocular rotations, presence of fusional vergence and stereopsis (60 seconds of arc or better). Fusional amplitudes were compared between <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>deviation</b> (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 PD) in esophoria and exophoria. The fusion reserve ratio was calculated (to assess the effect of the underlying <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>deviation)</b> as fusional convergence divided by prism alternating cover test measurements. Results: Two-hundred and eleven children (7. 65 ± 1. 16 years) were recruited to this study. Exophoria was most common for near (n= 181; 85. 8 %) and distance (n= 20; 9. 5 %). Esophoria was present in 22 children for near (10. 4 %) and in 1 child for distance (0. 5 %). No {{significant differences were found between}} fusional amplitudes and <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>deviation</b> for near (p> 0. 05). Children with exophoria of 10 PD had a slight, but not, significant (p= 0. 264) increase in fusional convergence from 2 PD (19. 95 ± 5. 09) to 10 PD (26. 67 ± 5. 77). In esophoric children the variation of fusional convergence was smaller from 2 P (25. 00 ± 0. 00) to 10 PD (22. 50 ± 3. 54) and non significant (p= 0. 185). The fusion reserve ratio was significantly smaller in children with higher deviations (i. e. 10 PD) for both esophoria (p= 0. 003) and exophoria (p> 0. 001). The fusion reserve ratio ranged between 12. 50 (2 PD) and 2. 25 ± 0. 35 (10 PD) for esophoria and between 9. 98 ± 2. 55 (2 PD) and 2. 67 ± 0. 58 (10 PD) for exophoria. Conclusions: <b>Angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>deviation</b> is not an efficient measure to predict fusional amplitudes. The fusion reserve ratio appears to be a better measurement to assess the effect of the underlying <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>deviation</b> on fusional convergence. More studies are necessary to understand better the relationship between fusion amplitudes and <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>deviation...</b>|$|E

Twenty-nine TED patients (58 orbits) with vertical strabismus were enrolled in the study. All patients underwent complete ophthalmic examination including prism, alternate cover, and Krimsky tests. Orbital CT scans were also performed on each patient. Digital image analysis was used to quantify superior rectus (SR) and inferior rectus (IR) muscle cross-sectional areas and volumes.
