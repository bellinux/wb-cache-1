60|$|Animism supplanted Theism. Nothing {{could be}} more explicit. But, though we have found an {{authentic}} Zulu text to suit our provisional theory, the most eminent philosophical example must not reduce us into supposing that this text settles the question. Dr. Callaway collected great masses of Zulu answers to his inquiries, and it is plain that <b>a</b> <b>respondent,</b> like the native theologian whom we have cited, may have adapted his reply {{to what he had}} learned of Christian doctrine. Having now the Christian notion of a Divine Creator, and knowing, too, that the unworshipped Unkulunkulu is said to have 'made things,' while only ancestral spirits, are worshipped, the native may have inferred that worship (by Christians given to the Creator) was at some time transferred by the Zulus from Unkulunkulu to the Amatongo. The truth is that both the anthropological theory (spirits first, Gods last), and our theory (Supreme Being first, spirits next) can find warrant in Dr. Callaway's valuable collections. For that reason, the problem must be solved after a survey of the whole field of savage and barbaric religion; it cannot be settled by the ambiguous case of the Zulus alone.|$|E
6000|$|A {{sufficient}} interval has now {{passed to}} allow all the sediment of party fanaticism {{to fall to}} the bottom. The circumstances {{of the world have}} since Burke's time undergone variation enough to enable us to judge, from many points of view, how far he was the splendid pamphleteer of a faction, and how far he was a contributor to the universal stock of enduring wisdom. Opinion is slowly, but without reaction, settling down to the verdict that Burke is one of the abiding names in our history, not because he either saved Europe or destroyed the Whig party; but because he added to the permanent considerations of wise political thought, and to the maxims of wise practice in great affairs, and because he imprints himself upon us with a magnificence and elevation of expression that places him among the highest masters of literature, in one of its highest and most commanding senses. Those who have acquired a love for abstract politics amid the almost mathematical closeness and precision of Hobbes, the philosophic calm of Locke or Mill, or even the majestic and solemn fervour of Milton, are revolted by the unrestrained passion and the decorated style of Burke. His passion appears hopelessly fatal to success in the pursuit of Truth, who does not usually reveal herself to followers thus inflamed. His ornate style appears fatal to the cautious and precise method of statement, suitable to matter which is not known at all unless it is known distinctly. Yet the natural ardour which impelled Burke to clothe his judgments in glowing and exaggerated phrases, is one secret of his power over us, because it kindles in those who are capable of that generous infection <b>a</b> <b>respondent</b> interest and sympathy. But more than this, the reader is speedily conscious of the precedence in Burke of the facts of morality and conduct, of the many interwoven affinities of human affection and historical relation, over the unreal necessities of mere abstract logic. Burke's mind was full of the matter of great truths, copiously enriched from the fountains of generous and many-coloured feeling. He thought about life as a whole, with all its infirmities and all its pomps. With none of the mental exclusiveness of the moralist by profession, he fills every page with solemn reference and meaning; with none of the mechanical bustle of the common politician, he is everywhere conscious of the mastery of laws, institutions, and government over the character and happiness of men. Besides thus diffusing a strong light over the awful tides of human circumstance, Burke has the sacred gift of inspiring men to use a grave diligence in caring for high things, and in making their lives at once rich and austere. Such a part in literature is indeed high. We feel no emotion of revolt when Mackintosh speaks of Shakespeare and Burke in the same breath as being both of them above mere talent. And we do not dissent when Macaulay, after reading Burke's works over, again, exclaims, [...] "How admirable! The greatest man since Milton." ...|$|E

Next, those who take care of more on health risk of using groundwater are willing to pay much more for the GPP fund at the bid price of 270, 828 VND per year to expect to obtain an unpolluted groundwater source. The difference depending on <b>a</b> <b>respondent’s</b> attitude to health impact is 16.3 times. Finally, <b>a</b> <b>respondent’s</b> perception on environmental issues affects the WTP response choice. Those who think that the environment quality is seriously bad exercise higher price than those who do not care about it.

The {{tradition of}} pregame prayer in interscholastic {{sports in the}} United States is well established, despite explicit restrictions from Supreme Court cases prohibiting pregame prayer practices due to the obvious violation of the First Amendment Establishment Clause provision. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study was to investigate the level of knowledge of legally allowable pregame prayer practices and to ascertain the current pregame prayer practices of current Illinois head high-school football coaches in Class 1 A and 6 A schools. A survey was sent to all 67 (45 returned) Class 1 A and 103 (48 returned) Class 6 A head high-school football coaches in the state of Illinois. The data revealed that 28 (31. 10 %) of all respondents correctly chose the legally allowable pregame prayer procedure (Knowledge), with 11 (25. 60 %) of the Class 1 <b>A</b> <b>respondents</b> and 17 (36. 20 %) of the Class 6 <b>A</b> <b>respondents</b> answering the item correctly. The data also revealed that 23 (24. 70 %) of all respondents were currently practicing the legally allowable pregame prayer procedure (Practice), and 12 (26. 70 %) of the Class 1 <b>A</b> <b>respondents</b> and 11 (22. 90 %) of the Class 6 <b>A</b> <b>respondents</b> were currently complying with the prescribed pregame practice procedure. A Phi test revealed a statistically significant difference in the current practice between those respondents who answered the correct response to the Knowledge item and those who did not, indicating that knowledge of allowable Practice was important in actually complying with the law. A t test revealed a statistically significant difference in Knowledge between the two classes. Class 6 <b>A</b> <b>respondents</b> demonstrated <b>a</b> greater level of Knowledge than did the Class 1 <b>A</b> <b>respondents.</b> Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference between the two classes in Practice or between those respondents who perceived themselves to be religious and those who did not perceive themselves to be religious.
