5|$|Many species forage {{for food}} in the canopy of trees, taking {{advantage}} of serotiny (the storage of a large supply of seed in cones or gumnuts by plant genera such as Eucalyptus, Banksia and Hakea), a natural feature of the Australian landscape in dryer regions. These woody fruiting bodies are inaccessible to many species and harvested in the main by parrots, cockatoos and rodents in more tropical regions. The larger cones can be opened by the large bills of cockatoos but are too strong for smaller animals. Many nuts and fruits lie {{on the end of}} small branches which are unable to support the weight of the foraging cockatoo, which instead bends the branch towards itself <b>and</b> <b>holds</b> <b>it</b> with its foot.|$|E

25|$|The {{eye of a}} bird {{most closely}} resembles that of the reptiles. Unlike the {{mammalian}} eye, it is not spherical, and the flatter shape enables more of its visual field to be in focus. A circle of bony plates, the sclerotic ring, surrounds the eye <b>and</b> <b>holds</b> <b>it</b> rigid, but an improvement over the reptilian eye, also found in mammals, is that the lens is pushed further forward, increasing {{the size of the}} image on the retina.|$|E
25|$|Mio and Jum-Jum {{journey to}} Kato's castle, {{where they are}} {{captured}} and imprisoned. Kato throws Mio's sword into the lake outside the castle. However, Mio discovers that his newly lined cape turns him invisible when worn inside-out, and reclaims his sword {{with the help of}} Kato's birds. Armed and invisible, he escapes and makes his way to Kato's chamber, eluding the castle guards. Taking off his cloak, Mio challenges Kato to combat and eventually slays him. Turning into rock, the dead knight crumbles into pieces. Mio picks up Kato's stone heart <b>and</b> <b>holds</b> <b>it</b> outside a window, where it transforms into a bird and flies away.|$|E
25|$|An {{official}} campaign, The Golden Gift, {{was released}} as a download on Microsoft's website. The campaign follows {{the adventures of}} Brokk and Eitri, the dwarves who appeared in the initial campaign. The plot unfolds with both dwarves planning to create a giant golden boar as an offering to the Norse god Freyr. While working separately, Brokk is approached by Skult (also from Fall of the Trident) who warns him that Eitri is making preparations to create the boar without his brother, of which Eitri is also told the same about Brokk. As both brothers race to complete the boar in the great forge, Skult steals the finished piece <b>and</b> <b>holds</b> <b>it</b> in Loki's fortress. The brothers eventually assault the base, and the boar is retrieved and successfully offered to Freyr.|$|E

25|$|At the pier, Meg {{prepares to}} drown Gustave, who cannot swim, when the others arrive to confront her. She reveals to the Phantom that the {{resources}} Madame Giry has afforded him came from Meg's {{working as a}} prostitute to influential men. She expresses her hurt and resentment that the Phantom never took any notice of her or appreciated her singing and dancing. After sharing her feelings, Meg decides to let Gustave live and releases him. She produces a gun <b>and</b> <b>holds</b> <b>it</b> to her head, intent on ending her misery. The Phantom tries to apologise and console her, but when he unthinkingly mentions Christine's name, Meg becomes agitated once again. When the Phantom tries to take the gun from her, Meg accidentally shoots Christine ("Please Miss Giry, I Want To Go Back").|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Martha {{has been}} making her own way {{with one of the}} Hath to the Source. They are {{traveling}} {{on the surface of the}} planet when the Hath chooses to sacrifice itself to save Martha from quicksand. Devastated, she reunites with the Doctor and Donna near the Source shortly before both armies arrive. The Doctor declares the war to be over and releases the terraforming agent. Everyone present lays down their weapons except for Cobb, who tries to shoot the Doctor. Jenny steps in the way and takes a bullet to the chest, and the Doctor holds her as she dies. After mourning the loss of his daughter, an enraged Doctor picks up Cobb's gun <b>and</b> <b>holds</b> <b>it</b> to his head, but refuses to shoot him. He angrily throws the gun aside and declares that the humans and Hath should build their new society based on peace.|$|E

Luke tosses the snake to the boss as a joke, before he hands him his walking cane. Dragline advises Luke {{to be more careful}} about his actions pertaining to the [...] "man with no eyes." [...] A rainstorm causes everyone to prematurely end their work. Before he joins the other prisoners in the truck, Luke shouts to God, testing him. On that same evening, Luke receives a letter stating that his mother has died.|$|E

500|$|However, {{the flower}} is {{constructed}} {{in such a}} way as to make the surface almost impossible to cling to, with smooth, downward-pointing hairs; the bees commonly slip and fall into the fluid in the bucket, and the only navigable route out is a narrow, constricting passage that either glues a [...] "pollinium" [...] (a pollen sack) on their body (if the flower has not yet been visited) or removes any pollinium that is there (if the flower has already been visited). The passageway constricts after a bee has entered, <b>and</b> <b>holds</b> <b>it</b> there for a few minutes, allowing the glue to dry and securing the pollinium. It has been suggested that this process involves [...] "inebriation" [...] of the bees, but this effect has never been confirmed.|$|E
500|$|Regarding {{the society}} itself, like social {{institutions}} in general, Durkheim {{saw it as}} a set of social facts. Even more than [...] "what society is", Durkheim was interested in answering [...] "how is a society created" [...] and [...] "what holds a society together". In The Division of Labour in Society, Durkheim attempted to answer the question of what holds the society together. He assumes that humans are inherently egoistic, but norms, beliefs and values (collective consciousness) form the moral basis of the society, resulting in social integration. Collective consciousness is of key importance to the society, its requisite function without which the society cannot survive. Collective consciousness produces the society <b>and</b> <b>holds</b> <b>it</b> together, {{and at the same time}} individuals produce collective consciousness through their interactions. Through collective consciousness human beings become aware of one another as social beings, not just animals.|$|E
500|$|The video {{opens with}} Stan {{and some of}} her male back-up dancers being {{presented}} in a dark white room. Subsequently, the room becomes enlightened and Stan is seen wearing transparent sunglasses, a white sweatband and a silver jacket. Following this, she retrieves a tennis racket from one of her background dancers <b>and</b> <b>holds</b> <b>it</b> {{in front of her face}} before returning the racket to a nearby dancer. Next, Stan performs the pre-refrain of the song, while two female performers clutch a hair dryer in their hands. For the refrain, she and ten other female background dancers are performing synchronized dances, with them having wigs on, and dressing white clothing and red accessories. Following this, Stan is presented standing on a yellow plate which is kept in the air by two threads. She wears a silver leotard and a multicolored wig. Next, Stan is shown walking into a tennis field, whereon she plays a tennis match against herself. For the breakdown of [...] "Cherry Pop", the video gets introduced into a dark-lighted room. There, [...] her previously shown male background dancers are presented; the video continues with Stan dancing accompanied by her dancers. The clip finally ends with a pink tennis ball dropping out of the ceiling, while the screen becomes black.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "Dual Spires enhanced" [...] video at the Psych website lists further {{references}} to Twin Peaks. Shawn's name for Gus in this episode is [...] "Lodge Blackmunn", a direct {{reference to the}} Black and White Lodge. Leo the Cinnamon Owl is a reference to Killer BOB, who possessed Leland Palmer and often {{took the form of}} an owl. The sheriff's deputy is Deputy Frost, named after Twin Peaks co-creator Mark Frost. The doctors of both Dual Spires and Twin Peaks have coconuts in their offices. Both Paula's and Laura's diaries described meetings with [...] "J". Sheriff Jackson tells Bob he needs to be strong for his wife. Dr Hayward says the same thing to Leland Palmer in Twin Peaks. Upon entering the town Gus mentions that the residents are looking {{at him as if he}} were the first black man they had ever seen. There are very few black men in Twin Peaks. When they enter the Sawmill Diner Bob Barker says [...] "Top of the morning to you." [...] In the first season of Twin Peaks, Pete Martell corrected Josie Packard on the saying. Maudette wears an orchid in her hair; Harold grew orchids in Twin Peaks. In the library Shawn asks if they can [...] "poke around" [...] but he and Gus immediately say [...] "peek" [...] in correction. Thus [...] "peek", as in Twin Peaks, is spoken twice. A man wearing a hat in the Sawmill Diner gives Shawn and Gus a thumbs up. The older room service attendant did the same thing to Agent Cooper in Twin Peaks. A record player is featured prominently in both the Barker and Palmer homes. The Roadhouse was also a location in Twin Peaks. Both Maudette and Audrey Horne love to dance. Paula's friend Jack is completely blind in one eye, referencing Twin Peaks' brothel named [...] "One Eyed Jacks". In the library Shawn and Gus find a book entitled [...] "Putt Your Way to a Better Future." [...] After Leland Palmer killed Maddy Ferguson he was seen putting golf balls around in his living room. When Randy is using the table saw it resembles the sawmill scene from the extended opening credits of Twin Peaks. When Maudette is placed in the body bag it is bent in such a way that it resembles a smile, like the smiling bag clue Agent Cooper found. On Maudette's desk beside her computer is a roll of green tape like the kind used by Leland Palmer to tie up Jacques Renault. In the cabin Bob Barker lights a match <b>and</b> <b>holds</b> <b>it</b> up like Leland Palmer did when describing BOB to Agent Cooper. Bob Barker wears a gold ring on his pinky, something Agent Cooper did in Twin Peaks. In the cabin the walls are red with red drapes as an allusion to the [...] "Red Room" [...] in Agent Cooper's dream.|$|E

2500|$|Caterpillars {{have been}} used symbolically in media to symbolize characters' {{positioning}} at or reluctance to progress past {{an early stage of}} development (e.g., in the Mad Men season 3 episode, [...] "The Fog", in which Betty Draper has a drug-induced dream, while in labor, that she captures a caterpillar <b>and</b> <b>holds</b> <b>it</b> firmly in her hand) or in combination with butterflies to show their maturation (e.g., in The Sopranos season 5 episode, [...] "The Test Dream", in which Tony Soprano dreams that Ralph Cifaretto has a caterpillar on his bald head that changes into a butterfly).|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} years of Camelot, about 1,000 years before the Present, Merlin is walking through the forest, calling out The Dark One with the Dagger of Kris. As the {{original}} Dark One appears, Merlin tells the gold masked being that he destroyed the only woman he ever loved, so now he will destroy him. However, Merlin fails in his attempt to stab the Dark One, only to drop the knife in shock, saying that he can't do it. The Dark One then picks up the dagger, <b>and</b> <b>holds</b> <b>it</b> to Merlin's neck, with Merlin telling the Dark One that he [...] "misses her." [...] However, the Dark One uses the Dagger to collect a teardrop from Merlin instead, which causes the Dagger to briefly glow purple, and turns him (Merlin) into a tree.|$|E
