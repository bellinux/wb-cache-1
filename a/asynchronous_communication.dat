50|$|Disentrained channels—most often <b>asynchronous</b> <b>communication,</b> {{via email}} or forums—gives {{individuals}} {{a way to}} manage their relationships within groups more efficiently than via FtF. Using <b>asynchronous</b> <b>communication,</b> such as email, individuals are able to manage group relationships {{in a way that}} maximizes time spent on group tasks. Through the process of entrainment, people synchronize their activities to meet the requirements of the group's needs, which is constrained by each individuals time and attention. Entrainment can make it difficult for groups to complete tasks together since it requires FtF, and thus synchronous, communication, which may include off-topic discussions that hinder productivity. <b>Asynchronous</b> <b>communication</b> may mitigate entrainment associated with group interaction. According to Walther, asynchronous group interaction may not be constrained by time and/or competing commitments. Group members using <b>asynchronous</b> <b>communication</b> can devote their full attention to the group when they have the opportunity. Greater attention can be spent focusing on tasks related to the group rather than spending time and effort on communication that is irrelevant to the goal.|$|E

50|$|Synchronous {{communication}} can be {{built on}} top of <b>asynchronous</b> <b>communication</b> by using a Synchronizer.For example, the α-Synchronizer works by ensuring that the sender always waits for an acknowledgement message from the receiver.The sender only sends the next message after the acknowledgement has been received. On the other hand, <b>asynchronous</b> <b>communication</b> can also be built on top of synchronous communication. For example, modern microkernels generally only provide a synchronous messaging primitive and asynchronous messaging can be implemented on top by using helper threads.|$|E

A {{high-performance}} space-time {{two dimensional}} RAKE receiving {{algorithm was proposed}} in <b>asynchronous</b> cooperative <b>communication</b> system. the transmitting signals were estimated coarsely by traditional space-time rake receiver, then {{on the basis of}} that we introduce feedback technology, each multipath signal of transmitted signals was composed by the decision results, and then every multipath component in the received signal can be obtained by eliminating the composed multipath signals from the received signal. Finally, the multipath components were combined by space-time combination and multipath combination rules accordingly, so spatial as well as multipath diversities were achieved.
