40|$|International {{audience}} 1.  In this paper, the foraging behaviour (the proximal mechanisms {{involved in}} patch-leaving {{rules and the}} egg dispersion) of an egg parasitoid, Anaphes victus, was analysed in environments containing either patches of constant quality (i. e. predictable environment) or patches of variable quality (i. e. unpredictable environment) {{in order to determine}} the motivational mechanisms used in patch-leaving strategies. 2.  Comparison of the patch exploitation strategy of A. victus between the different habitats suggested that the response of A. victus to <b>a</b> given patch <b>quality</b> strongly depended on its past experiences. Females allocated more time and more eggs in <b>a</b> mixed <b>quality</b> patch after experiencing <b>a</b> poor <b>quality</b> patch than after experiencing <b>a</b> good <b>quality</b> patch. In <b>a</b> poor <b>quality</b> patch, females superparasitised more frequently after experiencing <b>a</b> poor <b>quality</b> patch than after experiencing <b>a</b> good <b>quality</b> patch. In <b>a</b> good <b>quality</b> patch, <b>A.</b> victus females laid more eggs after having visited two poor quality patches than after visiting good quality patches. 3.  Recent foraging experiences are used to estimate both the availability and spatial distribution of hosts in the environment and adjust foraging decisions accordingly. The observed variability in the patch-leaving rules within the same species stresses the importance of previous experience when describing behaviours of female parasitoids...|$|R

5|$|As John Wilson {{and others}} have noted, it is {{difficult}} to define leisure. Its definitions are numerous and often mutually contradictory, for example as a discrete portion of one's time or as <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> of experience irrespective of time. Joffre Dumazedier distinguished four distinct definitions of leisure, which begin broadly and gradually narrow in scope. The first and broadest defines leisure as a style of behavior that may occur even at work, the second defines it as any non-work activity; the third further excludes family and household obligations; and, finally, the narrowest defines leisure as activities dedicated to self-fulfillment. Dumazedier's four definitions are not exhaustive. Incompatible definitions and measures are seen as a major factor accounting for occasionally contradictory research findings.|$|E

5|$|Beagles {{were in the}} United States by the 1840s at the latest, but {{the first}} dogs were {{imported}} strictly for hunting and were of variable quality. Since Honeywood had only started breeding in the 1830s, it is unlikely these dogs were representative of the modern breed and the description of them as looking like straight-legged Dachshunds with weak heads has {{little resemblance to the}} standard. Serious attempts at establishing <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> bloodline began in the early 1870s when General Richard Rowett from Illinois imported some dogs from England and began breeding. Rowett's Beagles are believed to have formed the models for the first American standard, drawn up by Rowett, L. H. Twadell, and Norman Ellmore in 1887. The beagle was accepted as a breed by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1885. In the 20th century the breed has spread worldwide.|$|E

When Beatlemania stormed the UK in 1963, Epstein was besieged by novelty goods companies wanting to use The Beatles' name and images on plastic guitars, drums, disc racks, badges, belts and a huge variety of assorted merchandise.

When Robert died in 1598 he left a complex will that led to legal disputes between the family and the executor, Sir Roger Mostyn. The legal case effectively halted any further development of the house, by now the most prominent in Conwy, until its resolution in 1630. The property passed to Robert's grandson, another Robert Wynn, in 1637, and onto his daughter, Elin in 1683. By 1665, the house was equipped to <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> and style that would have put it only just behind the houses of the major gentry families in Caernarfonshire.
