5|$|The flame fougasse has {{remained}} in army field manuals as a battlefield expedient {{to the present}} day. Such weapons are improvised from <b>available</b> <b>fuel</b> containers combined with standard explosive charges or hand grenades and are triggered electrically or by lengths of detonating cord. In some designs, detonating cord is used to rupture the container immediately before triggering the propelling charge. In order to guarantee ignition, the improvised devices frequently feature two explosive charges, one to throw {{and the other to}} ignite the fuel. Weapons of this sort were widely used in the Korean and Vietnam Wars as well as other conflicts.|$|E

25|$|One {{assessment}} {{from the}} IAEA showed that enough high-grade ore exists {{to supply the}} needs of the current reactor fleet for 40–50 years. According to Sovacool (2011), reserves from existing uranium mines are being rapidly depleted, and expected shortfalls in <b>available</b> <b>fuel</b> threaten future plants and contribute to volatility of uranium prices at existing plants. Escalation of uranium fuel costs decreased the viability of nuclear projects. Uranium prices rose from 2001 to 2007, before declining.|$|E
25|$|Sawdust, {{bark and}} chips are already used for decades for fuel in {{industrial}} processes; {{examples include the}} {{pulp and paper industry}} and the sugar cane industry. Boilers in the range of 500,000lb/hr of steam, and larger, are in routine operation, using grate, spreader stoker, suspension burning and fluid bed combustion. Utilities generate power, typically in the range of 5 to 50 MW, using locally <b>available</b> <b>fuel.</b> Other industries have also installed wood waste fueled boilers and dryers in areas with low-cost fuel.|$|E
25|$|The clay plate can be {{difficult}} to use, produces large amounts of smoke, and can be dangerous to children. Because of this inefficient cooking method, much of the area's limited fuel resources are wasted. However, in 2003, an Eritrean research group designed a stove, which uses <b>available</b> <b>fuel</b> sources (including dung, locally called kubet) for cooking injera and other foods efficiently, saving the heat from the fuel. This cooking method was intended for designing a new type of stove. Several parts are made in the central cities of Ethiopia and Eritrea while other parts are molded from clay by women in local areas.|$|E

40|$|Fuel cells will {{undoubtedly}} find widespread {{use in this}} new millennium in the conversion of chemical to electrical energy, as they offer very high efficiencies and have unique scalability in electricity generation applications. The solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) {{is one of the}} most exciting of these energy technologies; it is an all-ceramic device that operates at temperatures in the range 500 - 1000 ºC. The SOFC offers certain advantages over lower temperature fuel cells, notably its ability to utilise CO as a fuel rather than being poisoned and the availability of high-grade exhaust heat for combined heat and power or combined cycle gas turbine applications. Although cost is clearly the most important barrier to widespread SOFC implementation, perhaps the most important technical barriers currently being addressed relate to the electrodes, particularly the fuel electrode or anode. In terms of mitigating global warming, the ability of the SOFC to utilise commonly <b>available</b> <b>fuels</b> at high efficiency, promises an effective and early reduction in carbon dioxide emissions and hence is one of the lead new technologies to improve the environment. Herein, we discuss recent developments of SOFC fuel electrodes that will enable the better utilisation of readily <b>available</b> <b>fuels...</b>|$|R
25|$|Older {{stations}} {{tend to use}} {{a separate}} pipe for every kind of <b>available</b> <b>fuel</b> and for every dispenser. Newer stations may employ a single pipe for every dispenser. This pipe houses a number of smaller pipes for the individual fuel types. Fuel tanks, dispenser and nozzles used to fill car tanks employ vapor recovery systems, which prevents releases of vapor into the atmosphere with a system of pipes. The exhausts are placed as high as possible. A vapor recovery system may be employed at the exhaust pipe. This system collects the vapors, liquifies them and releases {{them back into the}} lowest grade fuel tank available.|$|E
25|$|The {{high cost}} of IGCC is the biggest {{obstacle}} to its integration in the power market; however, most energy executives recognize that carbon regulation is coming soon. Bills requiring carbon reduction are being proposed again both the House and the Senate, and with the Democratic majority {{it seems likely that}} with the next President there will be a greater push for carbon regulation. The Supreme Court decision requiring the EPA to regulate carbon (Commonwealth of Massachusetts et al. v. Environmental Protection Agency et al.) also speaks to the likelihood of future carbon regulations coming sooner, rather than later. With carbon capture, the cost of electricity from an IGCC plant would increase approximately 33%. For a natural gas CC, the increase is approximately 46%. For a pulverized coal plant, the increase is approximately 57%. This potential for less expensive carbon capture makes IGCC an attractive choice for keeping low cost coal an <b>available</b> <b>fuel</b> source in a carbon constrained world. However, the industry needs a lot more experience to reduce the risk premium. IGCC with CCS requires some sort of mandate, higher carbon market price, or regulatory framework to properly incentivize the industry.|$|E
500|$|Bi-fuel {{vehicles}}. The term flexible-fuel vehicles {{is sometimes}} used to include other alternative fuel vehicles that can run with {{compressed natural gas}} (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG; also known as autogas), or hydrogen. However, all these vehicles actually are bi-fuel and not flexible-fuel vehicles, because they have engines that store the other fuel in a separate tank, and the engine runs on one fuel at a time. Bi-fuel vehicles {{have the capability to}} switch back and forth from gasoline to the other fuel, manually or automatically. The most common <b>available</b> <b>fuel</b> in the market for bi-fuel cars is natural gas (CNG), and by 2008 there were 9,6 million natural gas vehicles, led by Pakistan (2.0 million), Argentina (1.7 million), and Brazil (1.6 million). [...] Natural gas vehicles are a popular choice as taxicabs in the main cities of Argentina and Brazil. Normally, standard gasoline vehicles are retrofitted in specialized shops, which involve installing the gas cylinder in the trunk and the CNG injection system and electronics.|$|E
30|$|Grasslands are {{especially}} suitable for our study because {{the plants are}} highly flammable, and the plant community is structurally simple, with less vertical structure and fewer fuel layers (ground, surface, and crown) than forests. Further, rapid elimination of aboveground plant biomass after fire is usually nearly complete (consumption of <b>available</b> <b>fuels</b> is commonly > 90 %), which simplifies assessing the effects of fire on animals. Plant recovery in grasslands is fairly rapid (Johnson 1997, Madden et al. 1999), so measuring recovery after fire is efficient.|$|R

500|$|Increased {{population}} {{and the growth of}} suburban areas near parklands, has {{led to the development of}} what is known as Wildland Urban Interface Fire Management, in which the park cooperates with adjacent property owners in improving safety and fire awareness. This approach is common to many other protected areas. As part of this program, houses and structures near the park are designed to be more fire resistant. Dead and fallen trees are removed from near places of human habitation, reducing the <b>available</b> <b>fuel</b> load and the risk of a catastrophic fire, and advance warning systems are developed to help alert property owners and visitors about forest fire potentials during a given period of the year. Glacier National Park has an average of 14 fires with [...] burnt each year. In 2003, [...] burned in the park after a five-year drought and a summer season of almost no precipitation.

500|$|Lunar Lander is {{the name}} of several video games built on the same concept. In all {{variations}} of the game, the player controls a spaceship as it falls towards the surface of the Moon or other astronomical bodies, and must maneuver the ship's thrusters so as to land safely before exhausting the <b>available</b> <b>fuel.</b> In many versions of the game, the player must adjust the ship's orientation, as well as its horizontal and vertical velocities. The initial version of the game was a text-based game named Lunar, or alternately the Lunar Landing Game, written in the FOCAL programming language for the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-8 minicomputer by Jim Storer while a high school student in the fall of 1969. Two other versions were written soon after by other programmers in BASIC. Lunar was converted to BASIC by David H. Ahl, who included all three versions in his 1973 101 BASIC Computer Games; {{by the end of the}} decade, the type of game was collectively known as a [...] "lunar lander" [...] game.|$|E
500|$|The first {{nuclear reactor}} in the UK, a small 100kW {{research}} reactor known as GLEEP, went critical at Harwell on 15 August 1947. It was fuelled by [...] of uranium metal and [...] of uranium dioxide, and used [...] of nuclear graphite as a neutron moderator. This was fine for some experimental work, but {{the production of}} radioactive isotopes required a more powerful 6,000kW reactor with a higher neutron flux. British staff at the Montreal Laboratory had designed [...] BEPO in 1945 and 1946; Risley handled the engineering and construction. The key choices in reactor design are {{the selection of the}} fuel, the neutron moderator, and the coolant. Since enriched uranium was unavailable, the only <b>available</b> <b>fuel</b> was natural uranium. Similarly, while the Montreal Laboratory had experience with designing and building the ZEEP heavy-water reactor in Canada, no heavy water was available in the UK, so graphite was the only choice for a neutron moderator. That left cooling, and for an experimental reactor, air cooling was the obvious choice. The resulting reactor was thus quite similar to the American X-10 Graphite Reactor.

Convoy PQ 17, which left Iceland on 27 June bound for the Soviet Union, was the next convoy targeted by Tirpitz {{and the rest of the}} German fleet stationed in Norway, during Unternehmen Rösselsprung (Operation Knight's Move). Escorting the convoy were the battleships Duke of York and [...] and the carrier Victorious. Tirpitz, , and six destroyers sortied from Trondheim, while a second task force consisting of , Admiral Scheer, and six destroyers operated out of Narvik and Bogenfjord. Lützow and three of the destroyers struck uncharted rocks while en route to the rendezvous and had to return to port. Shortly after Tirpitz left Norway, the Soviet submarine K-21 fired two or four torpedoes at the ship, all of which missed. The Soviets claimed two hits on the battleship. Swedish intelligence had meanwhile reported the German departures to the British Admiralty, which ordered the convoy to disperse. Aware that they had been detected, the Germans aborted the operation and turned over the attack to U-boats and the Luftwaffe. The scattered vessels could no longer be protected by the convoy escorts, and the Germans sank 21 of the 34 isolated transports. Tirpitz returned to Altafjord via the Lofoten Islands.|$|E

During full power trials on 10 December 1940, King George V at 41,630 tons displacement achieved 111,700 shp at 230 rpm and a specific fuel consumption of 0.715lb per shp. [...] After 1942 the Royal Navy was forced to use fuel oils with considerably higher viscosity and greater seawater content than these boilers could efficiently use. The poor quality of the oil fuel combined with the seawater contamination to reduce the efficiency of the steam power plant and increased the maintenance required.
