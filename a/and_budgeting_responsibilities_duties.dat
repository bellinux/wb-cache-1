40|$|We {{consider}} an innovation contest between n {{firms in the}} presence of knowledge leakages from an innovating firm to its rivals. Our analysis focuses on the effects of these knowledge spillovers on merger activities between firms. In particular, we are interested in how different organizational designs of R&D after mergers affect profits of firms taking part in a merger and profits of their non-merging rivals. Three organizational arrangements are analyzed: first, a fusion of R&D departments in which the newly merged firm decides to close down one of the previously two R&D departments. Second, a profit center arrangement in which the newly merged firm keeps the old R&D departments as fully functional entities with a sovereign <b>budget</b> <b>responsibility</b> at each of the two departments. Third, a multisubsidiary organizational form in which the newly merged firm still keeps the old R&D departments but with restricted <b>budget</b> <b>responsibility</b> {{in the sense that they}} are forced to determine cooperatively their R&D budgets in order to maximize overall firm's profits. It turns out that the different organizational designs of R&D after the merger <b>and</b> the <b>budget</b> <b>responsibilities</b> have major impacts on merger outcomes.

They acknowledged that neither the people of their own countries nor those in Afghanistan had much patience left. ... The Iranian Foreign Minister used the conference {{as an opportunity to}} get in some digs at the foreign forces. The criticism came just {{a few weeks after the}} United Nations Security Council voted to enforce sanctions against Iran for failing to halt its nuclear program. 'The presence and increase in the number of foreign forces is one of the factors in the insecurity, violence and dissatisfaction of the public,' said ... Mottaki .... A moment later the United Nations special representative to Afghanistan, Staffan de Mistura, interrupted and told him to get to the point." [...] Another report from Kabul added [...] "Mottaki accused the U.S., Pakistan and allied forces of utilizing Afghanistan to support terrorist strikes inside Iran, including last week's bomb blasts in ... Zahedan, ... Sistan-Baluchistan province." [...] This report said United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton [...] "hadn't heard the comments ... charging the U.S. with supporting terrorism inside Iran"; and said that [...] "Mottaki exceeded his allotted time giving his speech, earning a rebuke from the conference's organizers. The Iranian diplomat said he had the right to give an extended account of the situation in Afghanistan, as Iran has been forced to absorb three million Afghans evading the fighting in their country." [...] A third report said, in part, that Mottaki said [...] "Increase in terrorism because of the active support of the US and NATO of terrorist groups in the region as part of their policy to sow ethnic and religious discord, is proof of the fact that the undesirable presence of the occupation forces has intensified insecurity and violence. Today, insecurity is not just plaguing the Afghan people but is in fact directly mushrooming in neighbouring states, especially in Pakistan." ...|$|R

This organization allowed the NCSS sales force to ignore traditional data processing procurement routes; they could instead sell directly to line managers with discretionary <b>budgets</b> <b>and</b> revenue <b>responsibility.</b> Doing so flew {{in the face of}} the technology establishment, which had hitherto maintained tight control over all technical decisions. Empowered end users were now able to ask and answer their own questions, without having to deal with the intermediary of a Computer Science professional.

40|$|Educators {{concerned}} with the development and maintenance of collegiate honors programs throughout the United States face considerable hurdles in these times of decreased funding, concerns about charges of elitism, and calls for accountability (Campbell 95). In 1990, the National Collegiate Honors Council (NCHC) published a monograph that identified a minimum of five concerns that should be periodically and systematically evaluated within a program: causes of attrition, liberal education goals of the curriculum, participation in cultural and community activities, administrative structure <b>and</b> <b>budget,</b> <b>and</b> advising <b>responsibilities</b> (Reihman, Varhus, 2 ̆ 6 Whipple). Although the NCHC, as well as accrediting bodies, strongly supports the assessment of honors programs, Greg Lanier reports little consistency in the process or the findings of such assessments (84). In spite of {{a growing body of}} literature supporting the benefits of honors programs (Achterberg; Cosgrove; Hartleroad; Park 2 ̆ 6 Maisto; Ross 2 ̆ 6 Roman; Seifert, Pascarella, Colangelo, 2 ̆ 6 Assouline; Shushok), some members of the national community of honors educators remain resistant to the concept of assessing their programs. Lanier cites the spring/summer 2006 volume of the Journal of the National Collegiate Honors Council (JNCHC) that included nine essays in its “Forum on Outcomes Assessment, Accountability, and Honors”; he writes that two thirds of them focused on the problem and dangers in program assessment. A common theme in several of the essays opposing assessment was that the unique and qualitative nature of the stated outcomes of honors programs makes assessment difficult or unhelpful (Digby; Freyman; Strong) ...|$|R

Unlike the project manager, who has broad <b>budget</b> <b>and</b> scheduling <b>responsibility,</b> the program designer oversees the artistic and functional direction, and therefore relays plans and specifications to the visual designers, interface designers, developers and project manager in order to construct the program. Similar to an information architect, the program designer does not necessarily dwell in the domain of information per se, but also may venture into instructional design, application design, and the overall design direction of those types of projects.|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} thirty years, local governments in most European {{countries}} have been granted at least limited access to borrowing. The rules in force include limitations {{on the amount of}} borrowing and/or debt service, restrictions on the purpose of debt and on borrowing from foreign institutions and/or from the central bank. The description of these rules and sanctions constitute the thrust of several academic studies on local borrowing and debt. What are the ingredients that make it work efficiently? Fiscal discipline is not a simple question of having or not rules limiting deficits and debt. From "soft" to "hard" budget constraints, there are various degrees of severity. Dafflon (1995, 1996) proposed a catalogue of ten key issues that might help local policymakers examine their budget management practices upon whether they promote <b>budget</b> <b>responsibility</b> or not. The catalogue also permits to qualify the budget constraint from "soft" to "hard" whether it is self-imposed or imposed top-down. Based on these arguments, we consider budget discipline versus <b>budget</b> <b>responsibility.</b> <b>Budget</b> discipline is a forced and constraining approach to obtaining a balanced budget at decentralised levels. The corresponding positive approach is <b>budget</b> <b>responsibility.</b> The balanced <b>budget</b> {{as a result of a}} prudent <b>and</b> proactive <b>budget</b> policy through which local governments adjust their investment policy to their real fiscal capacity and assess costs and benefits of each capital programmes in advance, in order to avoid excessive debt...|$|R
