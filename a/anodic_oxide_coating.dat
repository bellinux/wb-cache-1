40|$|The {{corrosion}} 			protection {{of aluminum}} and aluminum alloys is getting importance 			since {{it is used}} {{in a number of}} industries like aircraft industries, 			automotive and aerospace industries, for both technical and economic 			considerations. The uncoated aluminum sample has very thin oxide 			film naturally present and when it is broken down during the 			corrosion process, the corrosion of bare aluminum sample is severe. 			In the present work, different electrolyte compositions were used to 			obtain oxide coating on aluminum for its corrosion protection with 			no environmental pollution. The aluminum alloy samples were anodized 			in sulphuric/oxalic/ boric acid, sulphuric/citric/boric acid and 			sulphuric/tartaric acid electrolyte compositions at optimum 			conditions. It was observed from corrosion results that there was 			considerable increase in corrosion potential and decrease in 			corrosion current density. The increase in polarization resistance 			RP revealed enhanced 			corrosion protection by the coated samples. The corrosion rate of 			aluminum samples was also quite less for the coated samples. The 			surface morphology of the coated samples before and after corrosion 			test exhibited no significant difference in SEM micrographs and no 			localized corrosion was observed.

For thinner oxides the space-charge capacitance in the Si and the effect of the surfaceroughness have to be considered to obtain a good agreement of impedance and XPS data. A comparison of impedancespectra of <b>anodic</b> and thermal <b>oxides</b> shows that <b>anodic</b> <b>oxides</b> not only exhibit less ideal capacitive behavior but also showa drastically lower charge-transfer resistance indicating a relatively high mobility of ions in the <b>anodic</b> <b>oxide</b> film.
