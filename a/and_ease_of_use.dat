5|$|Advances {{during the}} last decades {{has led to the}} recent {{approval}} of several oral drugs. These drugs are expected to gain in popularity and frequency of use at the expense of previously existing therapies. Further oral drugs are still under investigation, the most notable example being laquinimod, which was announced in August 2012 to be the focus of a third phase III trial after mixed results in the previous ones. Similarly, Other studies are aimed to improve efficacy <b>and</b> <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> of already existing therapies through the use of novel preparations. Such is the case the PEGylated version of interferon-β-1a, that has a longer life than normal interferon and therefore it is being studied if given at less frequent doses has a similar efficacy than the existing product. With the completion of a robust two-year study, it is shown that the PEGylated interferon beta-1a has greater efficacy in decreasing relapse rate and disability progression compared to placebo for MS patients.|$|E
5|$|The M3 saw {{action for}} the first time during the defense of the Philippines in December 1941. It {{went on to become a}} factor in the Guadalcanal Campaign, where it was {{successfully}} employed against both Japanese armor and infantry. Throughout the war it remained effective against Japanese vehicles, which were thinly armored and were rarely committed in large groups. The light weight of the gun made it easy to move through difficult terrain; for example, when attacked by Japanese tanks on Betio during the Battle of Tarawa, Marines were able to heave the M3 over the -high seawall. While high-explosive and canister ammunition proved useful in stopping Japanese infantry attacks, against enemy fortifications the M3 was only somewhat effective because of its small high-explosive projectile. Its overall effectiveness <b>and</b> <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> meant the gun remained in service with the Marine Corps and with some army units in the Pacific until the end of the war. Unhappy with the unusually low shield of the M3, some Marine Corps units extended it to provide better protection. These extensions sometimes had a scalloped top edge, intended to improve camouflage. A standard kit was tested in 1945, but was never issued.|$|E

25|$|Telegraphy {{requires}} that the method used for encoding the message be known to both sender and receiver. Many methods are designed according {{to the limits of}} the signalling medium used. The use of smoke signals, beacons, reflected light signals, and flag semaphore signals are early examples. In the 19th century, the harnessing of electricity led to the invention of electrical telegraphy. The advent of radio in the early 20th century brought about radiotelegraphy and other forms of wireless telegraphy. In the Internet age, telegraphic means developed greatly in sophistication <b>and</b> <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> with natural language interfaces that hide the underlying code, allowing such technologies as electronic mail and instant messaging.|$|E
25|$|Metals {{can also}} be an {{effective}} way to confine light in structures equal to or smaller than the optical wavelength. This effect is emergent from the confined surface plasmon resonance induced by the resonating light, which, when confined to the surface of a nanostructure such as a gold channel or nanorod, induces electromagnetic resonance. Surface plasmon effects are strong in the visible range because the permittivity of a metal is very large and negative at visible frequencies. At frequencies higher than the visible range, the permittivity of a metal is closer to zero, and the metal stops being useful for focussing electric and magnetic fields. This effect was originally observed in radio and microwave engineering, where metal antennas and waveguides may be hundreds of times smaller than the free-space wavelength. In the same way, visible light can be constricted to the nano level with metal structures which form channels, tips, gaps, etc. Gold is also a convenient choice for nanofabrication because of its unreactivity <b>and</b> <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> with chemical vapour deposition.|$|E

The estate was completed in 1969. Reinforced concrete was the main material used due to its low cost <b>and</b> <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>use.</b> 30% of the houses constructed were intended for private sale, an unusually high percentage, with most of the privately sold houses being around the Park Lane area of the estate. As well as residential properties, there was also a shopping centre in the eastern part of the estate, five schools, two churches and a swimming pool. There were some clear links to the aviation heritage of the site within the names of the roads, with the three main roads running the length of the estate being constructed on the runways of the airfield, and the 34 tower blocks that contained 2,000 flats. There were two major concentrations of tower blocks within the estate: fourteen along Farnborough Road, and the 'Centre 8', a group of 8 large tower blocks in the centre of the estate. The following is a list of the tower blocks constructed on the estate.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the effectiveness of a learning management system called the eLearn@USM through usability testing. The researchers used the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to examine the usefulness <b>and</b> <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> the eLearn@USM for students to participate in the forum discussion, blogs, and messaging system. In addition, the usability of the system was evaluated using heuristics by providing a set of tasks corresponding to the three sections based on scenarios. Eight university students were selected as the research sample to participate in this study. Data were collected through think aloud protocols, audio recordings, interviews, observations and a set of questionnaire and were analyzed descriptively. The findings showed that the effectiveness of the forum is moderate (mean= 3. 5) while the usefulness <b>and</b> <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> the eLearn@USM were high with a mean value of 4. 12 and 4. 18 respectively. Overall, the study showed that the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> forums was more effective and attracted students’ attention. Compared to the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> blogs, the study found that the functions were similar to the forum and thus blogs were not as popular. Meanwhile the students preferred to use an external messaging system that they were familiar with rather than the one provided inside the eLearn@USM itself...|$|R

Instead, Jones and Seropian wrote a brand-new story for what became Pathways Into Darkness. Since Bungie had no money and Jones was the only one with the available time, he single-handedly coded the game on a Mac IIfx, passing art chores to his friend Colin Brent. Pathways was successful enough that Bungie moved from a one-bedroom apartment to an actual office.|$|E

GameTrailers called it a good complement to the Wii system and referred to all five games as a [...] "nice total package". They commented that the games provided enough gameplay for long time gamers without making it inaccessible to novices. GameTrailers stated, however, {{that the lack of}} a tournament mode was a detractor, and did not recommend paying for the game if it did not come bundled with the system. GamePro also commented that the free addition of Wii Sports with the Wii was a positive. Matt Casamassina of IGN called it a [...] "successful showpiece for Nintendo's new hardware" [...] and enjoyed the ability to import Miis. GameSpot editor Ryan Davis complimented the multiplayer aspect and the fitness test. Reviewers praised the game's controls <b>and</b> <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>use.</b> Casamassina referred to the controls as [...] "revolutionary" [...] and described them as intuitive. GamePro echoed similar comments, praising the ease of play and realistic motion controls, while Davis commented that the motion controls were sometimes erratic. Common criticism focused on the graphics and lack of depth in the separate games. Casamassina stated that the game [...] "comes up short in depth and visuals", and called the graphics [...] "generic" [...] and [...] "archaic". Other reviewers said the graphics were on par with Nintendo's older gaming systems, the GameCube and Nintendo 64. Davis criticized the oversimplified nature of the games, and GamePro stated that the separate games offered less depth than regular console sports games. Nintendo Power listed Wii Sports along with its sequel Wii Sports Resort as two of the greatest multi-player experiences in Nintendo's history, stating that everyone from young children to grandparents can enjoy the games. The magazine praised the grouping of sports and the game's longevity.|$|E
