Other safety systems functioned as required, ensuring adequate reactor cooling. There was no threat to local residents or the environment, and the alert, the second-lowest Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) emergency declaration, was terminated later that same day. The electrical fault caused an <b>arc</b> <b>flash,</b> resulting in a minor burn of a plant worker who was in the room and was treated at a local hospital. On March 22, 2017, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced that it had initiated a special inspection into the failure of the electrical bus that resulted in the plant declaring an alert.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} methods of {{protecting}} personnel from <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> hazards. This can include personnel wearing <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> {{personal protective equipment}} (PPE) or modifying the design and configuration of electrical equipment. The best way to remove the hazards of an <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> is to de-energize electrical equipment when interacting with it, however de-energizing electrical equipment is {{in and of itself}} an <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> hazard. In this case, one of the newest solutions is to allow the operator to stand far back from the electrical equipment by operating equipment remotely, this is called remote racking.|$|E

Those conducting flash hazard analyses must consider this boundary, and then must determine what PPE should be worn within the flash protection boundary. Remote operators or robots can be used to perform activities that have a high risk for <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> incidents, such as inserting draw-out circuit breakers on a live electrical bus.

The cells, modules, and inverters are all wired in parallel, and the module and system voltage is 50V. The low voltage, parallel architecture contributes to a highly reliable system architecture that has no {{single point of failure}} and a system that is inherently safe, with no possibility of generating <b>arc</b> <b>flashes</b> or lethal shocks. This architecture, combined with module integrated power electronics, enables tenKsolar’s modules to utilize static/non uniform reflection and therefore generate 20% more energy per installed Watt of power when combined with tenK’s integrated reflector. The integrated electronics also enable the system to automatically sense ground faults and shut down immediately. The ultimate result of tenKs technology is a system that is extremely energy dense, reliable, and safe.|$|R

In general, mean RT was found to increase from fovea to periphery for all four colors, with the curve for red stimuli exhibiting the most rapid positive acceleration with increasing angular eccentricity from the fovea.

Recent work has focused attention on the thermal effects of <b>arc</b> <b>flashes.</b> However, when electrical energy is converted into thermal energy in an arcing fault, still another energy conversion is taking place. Applications are on record that suggest that a considerable amount of force is created during an arcing fault. Concrete block walls can be destroyed by the increased pressure that is created during an arcing fault. This study is present about preventing injuries to people.

5000|$|One of {{the most}} common {{examples}} of an <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> occurs when an incandescent light bulb burns out. When the filament breaks, an arc is sustained across the filament, enveloping it in plasma with a bright, blue flash. Most household lightbulbs have a built-in fuse, to prevent a sustained arc-flash from forming and blowing fuses in the circuit panel. [...] Most 480 V electrical services have sufficient capacity to cause an <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> hazard. Medium-voltage equipment (above 600 V) is higher potential and therefore a higher risk for an <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> hazard. Higher voltages can cause a spark to jump, initiating an <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> without the need for physical contact, and can sustain an arc across longer gaps. Most powerlines use voltages exceeding 1000 volts, and can be an arc-flash hazard to birds, squirrels, people, or equipment such as vehicles or ladders. Arc flashes are often witnessed from lines or transformers just before a power outage, creating bright flashes like lightning that can be seen for long distances.|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} {{observation}} of the unusual kind of solar microflares, presumably associated with the so-called "topological trigger" of magnetic reconnection, which was theoretically suggested long time ago by Gorbachev et al. (Sov. Ast. 1988, v. 32, p. 308) but has not been clearly identified so far by observations. As {{can be seen in}} pictures by Hinode SOT in CaII line, there may be a bright loop connecting two sunspots, which looks at the first sight just as a magnetic field line connecting the opposite poles. However, a closer inspection of SDO HMI magnetograms shows that the respective arc is anchored in the regions of the same polarity near the sunspot boundaries. Yet another peculiar feature is that the <b>arc</b> <b>flashes</b> almost instantly as a thin strip and then begins to expand and decay, while the typical chromospheric flares in CaII line are much wider and propagate progressively in space. A qualitative explanation of the unusual flare can be given by the above-mentioned model of topological trigger. Namely, there are such configurations of the magnetic sources on the surface of photosphere that their tiny displacements result in the formation and fast motion of a 3 D null point along the arc located well above the plane of the sources. So, such a null point can quickly ignite a magnetic reconnection along the entire its trajectory. Pictorially, this can be presented as flipping the so-called two-dome magnetic-field structure (which is just the reason why such mechanism was called topological). The most important prerequisite for the development of topological instability in the two-dome structure is a cruciform arrangement of the magnetic sources in its base, and this condition is really satisfied in the case under consideration.

40|$|Electron-induced {{electrostatic}} discharge (ESD) {{can lead to}} severe spacecraft anomalies. It {{is crucial to the}} success of space missions that the likelihood of ESD occurrence is understood and mitigated. To aid in predicting ESD occurrence, a model for electric fields above and below the charge layer inside an electronirradiated dielectric material was developed. An instrumentation system was also designed to induce and detect ESD events. Because ESD events {{with a wide range of}} maximum current values can occur over a range of time intervals, multiple simultaneous detection methods were employed as charge was accumulated on a sample surface; these included monitoring of sample current and optical emissions from the sample surface. Data from ESD experimentation for James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) materials was used to verify that the instrumentation system was effective in inducing and observing ESD. Two types of discharge events were observed during JWST testing: a sudden-onset, decaying current accompanied by luminescence in the optical data, and an <b>arc</b> or <b>flash</b> in optical data. JWST test results were applied to the electric field models developed to determine the threshold electric field for luminescence onset. The models were also applied to the JWST materials in five different space plasma environments to determine the accumulated electric field as a function of time, and to thereby predict the likelihood of sample luminescence in each location...|$|R
5000|$|Another way to {{mitigate}} <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> {{is to use}} a triggered current limiter or commutating current limiter which inserts a low rated continuous current current limiting fuse that melts and interrupts the <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> within 4 ms.

Expensive high energy light sources are routinely used for UV light exposure, but this study describes an alternative low cost xenon flash unit constructed in our laboratory. A 300 J short <b>arc</b> xenon <b>flash</b> lamp (Heimann) was mounted in an elliptical reflector and driven by a modified Metz 60 CT 4 photoflash unit up to 240 J input energy and 4 ms flash duration. A 20 μl cuvette containing a test solution was placed in a complementary elliptical reflector. An ion selective calcium electrode was used to measure the free calcium concentration [Ca 2 +] before and after flash in test solutions containing 1. 00 mM Nitr 5 in combination with different added [Ca 2 +]s. Using this technique we estimated that 1 flash on 1. 00 mM Nitr 5 increased the free [Ca 2 +] from 10 − 7 to 1. 1 × 10 − 5 M. When the added [Ca 2 +] was less than 2. 3 × 10 − 4 M, the used Nitr 5 behaved as a strong calcium chelator because 23 % of it was unloaded with calcium. It is concluded that a physiologically relevant change in free [Ca 2 +] can be evoked by photolysis of Nitr 5 using a low cost (approximately $ 1500) xenon flash unit, and that ion selective Ca electrodes can be adequately used to monitor the resulting changes in [Ca 2 +]...|$|R
40|$|Subduction zone {{magmatism}} {{is a well}} studied area due {{to dangerous}} consequences of volcanic activity at subduction zones. Whilst it is widely accepted that water leaving the slab causes the magmatism, the method in which the water leaves the slab and causes magmatism is unclear. In this thesis we will examine the hypothesis that water leaving the slab via a large hydraulic fracture will cause instantaneous ‘flash’ melting in the mantle wedge. We will test whether this flash melting occurs and whether it produces sufficient melting. We will also look at hydrous flux melting and hydrous decompression melting occuring after the initial flash melting {{to see if they}} increase the melting. A thermal model for a subduction zone is built, with the wedge flow solved analytically, to provide the temperature input for the melting models. Four melting models were tested; flash melting, flash melting followed by hydrous flux melting, flash melting followed by hydrous decompression melting and flash melting, then hydrous flux melting followed by hydrous decompression melting. Another thermal model was also made with the wedge flow solved numerically, this allowed buoyancy to be added into the model to allow investigation into the magma migrating buoyantly. We show that the flash melting model does produce flash melting from large hydraulic fractures but the melting produced is not sufficient compared to observations from volcanic <b>arcs.</b> The <b>flash</b> melting followed by hydrous flux melting model also did not produce sufficient melting however the two decompression melting cases did when compared to observations from volcanic arcs.
