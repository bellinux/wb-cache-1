The Anglo-Egyptian Nile Expeditionary Force included 25,800 men, 8,600 of whom were British.

In preparation for the attack, the British established an army headquarters at the former rail head Wadi Halfa and extended and reinforced the perimeter defenses around Sawakin.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, NJDOT's new Arrow III railcars arrived several {{years ahead of}} the {{completion}} of electrification projects to allow their use in New Jersey commuter service. Amtrak by this time was desperate for electric propulsion, as the aging GG1 locomotives were reaching {{the end of their}} usefulness, replacement E60 locomotives were proving unreliable, and new EMD AEM-7 locomotives were only just beginning to arrive. In April 1978, Amtrak leased 70 of NJDOT's Arrow II cars for use on the Clockers, Keystone Service, and the new Chesapeake. By January 1979, the Arrows were rotated between the Clockers and Silverliner Service. The Arrows had bathrooms and water fountains, making them more suitable for the regional service than the Silverliners. In late 1980, under pressure from NJDOT, Amtrak returned all but 32 of the Arrows, which created a need to find other equipment for the Silverliner Service.

40|$|For {{a commercially}} {{operating}} railway company, providing {{a high level}} of service for the passengers is of utmost importance. The latter requires a high punctuality of the trains and an adequate rolling stock capacity. Unfortunately, the latter is currently (2002) one of the bottlenecks in the service provision by the main Dutch railway operator NS Reizigers. Especially during the morning rush hours, many passengers cannot be transported according to the usual service standards due to a shortage of the rolling stock capacity. On the other hand, a more effective allocation of the <b>available</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> capacity seems to be feasible, since there are also a few trains with some slack capacity. The effectiveness of the rolling stock capacity is determined mainly by the allocation of the train types and subtypes to the lines. Therefore, we describe in this paper a model {{that can be used to}} find an optimal allocation of train types and subtypes to train series. This optimal allocation is more effective than the manually planned one, which is accomplished by minimizing the shortages of capacity during the rush hours. The model is implemented in the modeling language OPL Studio 3. 1, solved by CPLEX 7. 0, and tested on several scenarios based on the 2001 - 2002 timetable of NS Reizigers. The results of the model were received positively, both by the planners and by the management in practice, since these results showed that a significant service improvement over the manually planned allocation can be achieved within a shorter throughput time of the involved part of the planning process. ...|$|E
