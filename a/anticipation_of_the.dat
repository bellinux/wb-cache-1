40|$|This thesis {{encompasses}} {{an experimental}} research study done {{as part of}} an honors program. The study aims to explore infants' knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> handles <b>of</b> tools by examining their grasping and anticipation behaviors. Infants must learn how to use many tools in order to engage in a variety of daily tasks. An unpublished pilot study in our lab suggests that 6. 5 to 8. 5 -month-old infants fixated more on <b>the</b> handle <b>of</b> a familiar tool than 3 - to 5 -month-olds (Hirtle, Strouse, Borten, & Needham, 2007). The current study aimed to extend this prior research by also obtaining measures of infants’ grasping behaviors on tools. Infants were more likely to make <b>anticipations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hand reaching for <b>the</b> handle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peeler than <b>the</b> handle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spoon, and {{were also more likely to}} make <b>anticipations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hand reaching for <b>the</b> usable portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spoon than <b>the</b> handle portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spoon. The only reliable predictor of infants’ first grasp location on the tools was age, with 12. 5 -month-olds more reliably grasping <b>the</b> handle <b>of</b> an adult spoon. Results are discussed in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experiences they have had with these tools and how they interpret those experiences.

40|$|Abstract The {{universal}} Turing {{machine is}} an anticipatory theory of computability by any digital or quantum machine.

This diagram {{can be used to}} test and classify physical devices and proposed algorithms for weak or strong anticipation. Quantum Information Science is more than a merger of Church-Turing and quantum theories.
