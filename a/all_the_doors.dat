5|$|A fire {{accident}} occurred in 1793 that destroyed the large gallery that connected the chapel {{to the north}} tower, and the west face of the large central tower was seriously damaged. The fire spread along the roofs and turrets of the northwest wing, and {{the upper part of}} the north tower was also burned. The chapel was sacked, and the flames destroyed its facade and part of its north wall. The crypt was not damaged. Most of the floors and fireplaces in the château and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> windows and woodwork were irreparably destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{arrived at}} the {{farmhouse}} one or two minutes after the police. They waited for a tactical firearms group to arrive, which turned up at 5am and decided to wait until daylight before trying to enter. Police determined that <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> and windows to the house were shut, except for {{the window in the}} main bedroom on the first floor. Using a loudhailer, they spent two hours trying to communicate with Sheila. The only sound they reported from the house was a dog barking.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Simpson {{family has}} barricaded <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> and windows {{except for the}} back door, which Homer forgot to do. Several zombies break into the house: Homer sacrifices himself to give the others time to escape, but the zombies leave him when they realize {{he does not have}} enough brains for them to eat. Lisa realizes that the school library must have a book that can reverse the spell. The Simpsons arrive at the Springfield Elementary library and Bart casts the {{appropriate}} counter spell, causing all zombies to return to their graves.|$|E

5|$|While {{trying to}} close the doors, the player must avoid certain hazards. Mario will lose a life if he touches an enemy, runs out of time, runs {{off the edge of}} the floor he is on, or if <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> are open. Enemies in the game are mostly regular Mario series creatures, such as Goombas, Koopas, Boos and their variations. The {{opponent}} on the last stage of each hotel is one of the Koopalings, who each use different methods to attack Mario.|$|E
5|$|Randall pursues them to {{the door}} vault, and a wild chase ensues among the {{millions}} of doors as they {{move in and out}} of the storage vault on rails to the factory floor. Boo's laughter causes <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> to activate, allowing the monsters to pass {{in and out of the}} human world. Randall attempts to kill Sulley, but Boo overcomes her fear and attacks him. Sulley and Mike trap Randall in the human world, where two residents at a trailer park mistake him for an alligator and beat him with a shovel. Sulley and Mike then trick Waternoose into revealing his plot with Randall, while Mike secretly records the entire conversation for the CDA to view. The CDA arrests Waternoose and it is revealed that Roz the monster in charge of paperwork is CDA #1 to which she orders Sulley and Mike to return Boo home and has her door shredded to prevent any more contact with her.|$|E
5|$|The {{morning of}} the {{evacuation}} promised a perfect day. The sun rose out of a calm and sparkling sea and warmed the impassive cliffs of Oiseval. The sky was hopelessly blue {{and the sight of}} Hirta, green and pleasant as the island of so many careless dreams, made parting all the more difficult. Observing tradition the islanders left an open Bible and a small pile of oats in each house, locked <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> and at 7am boarded the Harebell. Although exhausted by the strain and hard work of the last few days, they were reported to have stayed cheerful throughout the operation. But as the long antler of Dun fell back onto the horizon and the familiar outline of the island grew faint, the severing of an ancient tie became a reality and the St Kildans gave way to tears.|$|E
50|$|When <b>the</b> rear <b>doors</b> were {{eventually}} {{recovered from the}} sea, investigation determined {{that some of the}} locks had not engaged properly. Maintenance records showed that locks had been cannibalized for spares, then subsequently improperly refitted so that not <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> locks were engaging correctly. Furthermore, the flight crew confirmed that they had encountered difficulty closing <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> before take-off. As the air pressure differential increased with altitude, the few locks that were working correctly were unable to bear the load, and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> failed.|$|R
60|$|They <b>all</b> sat near <b>the</b> table spread for tea, Adam still near <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Lady Arabella fanned herself, {{complaining}} of heat, and {{told one of}} the footmen to throw <b>all</b> <b>the</b> outer <b>doors</b> open.|$|R

25|$|The {{hospital}} exterior {{was constructed}} with brick walls with two-light windows in gothic style; the hospital interior was painted in two colors, black and white, {{to imitate the}} marble colors of the other buildings. In 1562, during {{the time when the}} Medici dominated the city, the hospital was restructured according to Florentine renaissance canons; <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> and windows were modified with new rectangular ones encased in gray sandstone.|$|E
500|$|Wood changed clothes, {{packed his}} bags, {{and left the}} house shortly afterwards, leaving the weapon he used, an [...]38 Enfield revolver, {{in the kitchen with}} one live round left. The police went to the mansion on the evening of 22 September 1986 after {{receiving}} a telephone call from Wood; finding <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> and windows locked, they broke down the door. [...] Christopher was rushed to Sheffield Children's Hospital with severe head injuries and was placed on life support after surviving without medical attention for 21 hours.|$|E

50|$|The first {{escape from}} USP Marion {{occurred}} on October 10, 1975, when five inmates used a homemade electronic device {{to open the}} front gates of the prison. One {{of them had been}} an electrician and was assigned to work on the lock mechanisms of <b>all</b> of <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> in <b>the</b> main corridors. He also converted a radio into a remote control, with which he opened <b>all</b> of <b>the</b> <b>doors.</b> <b>The</b> five escapees were all eventually captured and returned to prison, the last one being apprehended in Canada on October 31, 1975.|$|R
60|$|The moment I {{entered the}} room I saw that some one had been there since I had left. A silk lay upon the floor. It {{had not been there}} before. There were also a dagger and several metal {{ornaments}} strewn about as though torn from their wearer in a struggle. But worst of <b>all,</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> leading to <b>the</b> pits where I had hidden my Princess was ajar.|$|R

500|$|It {{is often}} claimed that, despite its graphic nature, the [...] "shower scene" [...] never once shows a knife {{puncturing}} flesh. However, a {{frame by frame}} analysis of the sequence shows one shot in which the knife appears to penetrate Leigh's abdomen, but the effect may have been created by lighting and reverse motion. Leigh herself was so affected by this scene when she saw it, that she no longer took showers unless she absolutely had to; she would lock <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> and windows and would leave the bathroom and shower door open. She never realized until she first watched the film [...] "how vulnerable and defenseless one is".|$|E
500|$|Marguerite Louise feigned illness at {{the start}} of 1672: Louis XIV send Alliot le Vieux, Anne of Austria's {{personal}} physician, to tend to her. Dr. Alliot, unlike Mêmê, did not comply with Marguerite Louise's plot to be sent to France, ostensibly for the thermal waters to ameliorate her [...] "illness." [...] In December she went on a pilgrimage to Villa di Pratolino—she never returned. Marguerite Louise, instead of going back to Florence, chose to live in semi-retirement at Poggio a Caiano. The Grand Duke eventually consented, but feared she may abscond, so she was not allowed to go to leave without his permission and when she went riding she was to be escorted by four soldiers. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> and windows of the villa had to be secured, too. The saga between them continued until 26 December 1674, after all attempts at conciliation failed, a beleaguered Cosimo agreed to allow his wife to depart for the Convent of Montemarte, France. The contract signed that day renounced her rights as a Princess of the Blood and with them the dignity Royal Highness. Cosimo granted her a pension of 80,000 livres in compensation. She departed the next June, after stripping bare Poggio a Caiano of any valuables.|$|E
500|$|In January, Dennis catches Den and {{his girlfriend}} Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) in bed {{together}} and tells Chrissie who is stunned. Zoe discovers she is pregnant by Den. Chrissie persuades her to abort the baby, and later reveals that she knows it was Den's baby. Chrissie, Zoe and Sam Hunter (Kim Medcalf) plan revenge on Den; Chrissie for his lies and adultery, Zoe for forcing her to fake a pregnancy and then sleep with him, and Sam for losing her pub to Den in a corrupt scheme that both he and Chrissie were involved in. Chrissie plans to intimidate Den into signing the pub over to her. They confront Den but he takes it in his stride and openly talks about his sins, unaware that Sharon is hiding {{at the other side}} of the pub, listening to her father's confessions. Sharon berates Chrissie for tricking her into coming back to Walford with the lie that her father is ill. She storms out of the pub and Den follows. Chrissie knows that Sharon is the one person Den truly loves and cares about and knows that losing Den the love of his favourite child will destroy him. Den walks back in and she taunts him that he now knows what it is like to lose what he loves most. Unable to contain his rage, Den attacks his wife and hits her head against a fruit machine. Zoe picks up the nearest object (a metal, dog-shaped doorstop) and hits Den over the head with it and he falls to the ground. Perceiving him to be dead, Zoe and Sam go out the back to turn all the lights off and lock <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors.</b> A smug Chrissie starts to gloat that Den is dead, as if to say she has won. Den suddenly grabs her leg and hisses, [...] "You'll never get me out of the Vic." [...] so Chrissie picks up the doorstop and delivers a fatal blow to his head, secretly watched by Sam. The three women bury him in a hole in the pub's cellar, which is filled with cement the next morning.|$|E
5000|$|Although the Doors' active career {{ended in}} 1973, their {{popularity}} has persisted. According to the RIAA, they have sold 33 million certified {{units in the}} US and over 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling bands of <b>all</b> time. <b>The</b> <b>Doors</b> have been listed {{as one of the}} greatest artists of all time by many magazines, including Rolling Stone, which ranked them 41st on its list of the [...] "100 Greatest Artists of <b>All</b> Time". <b>The</b> <b>Doors</b> were <b>the</b> first American band to accumulate eight consecutive gold and platinum LP's.|$|R

2500|$|New Orleans {{architectural}} historian Samuel Wilson, Jr. influentially {{suggested that}} shotgun-style houses {{originated in the}} Creole suburbs (faubourgs) of New Orleans in the early 1800s. He also stated that the term [...] "shotgun" [...] is {{a reference to the}} idea that if <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> are opened, a shotgun blast fired into the house from the front doorway will fly cleanly to the other end and out at the back.|$|E
2500|$|The {{front door}} is an {{excellent}} example of doors characteristic of the Victorian era. It achieved two purposes: decorative but also to allow the passage of natural daylight. Almost <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> in this Museum have unique majestic-style characteristics not found in doors in the capital city of San Juan, where doors are considerably simpler. [...] The residence displays a harmonious appreciation for the style, as much by the architects as by the owners, of the Belle Époque.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, {{the triple}} Xs {{made a huge}} comeback. [...] When the old horse stables were {{converted}} from the Jersey Lilly into the Pearl Stable by Silver Ventures, the “xXx” was a massive part of the building’s motif. [...] The triple Xs were incorporated into {{areas such as the}} chandeliers, the millwork above <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> massive bronze plagues above the stage and around the mezzanine, in the custom carpet, and even the rafter bracing. [...] At almost every event, the audience is dared to count all the sets of triple Xs.|$|E

2500|$|The 1980 Caprice Classic saw {{its first}} major {{revision}} since the 1977 downsizing. To further improve the fuel {{economy of the}} car, {{efforts were made to}} reduce weight and improve aerodynamics. The Caprice received all new exterior sheet metal, without drastically changing the look of the car. To improve aerodynamics the hood was tapered lower, while the trunk area was higher. The grille was now an egg crate style while the tail-light panel featured three separate square lights per side. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> and components within were redesigned to be lighter, including the window crank mechanisms, which now used a tape drive mechanism. Greater use of aluminum including in-bumper reinforcement and in-sedan/coupe radiators helped to further reduce the overall weight of the vehicle. 1980 models were approximately [...] lighter than 1979 models.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the loss}} of his IBO belt, Booth spent almost two years away from the ring as he {{struggled}} with an alcohol addiction. Speaking about the matter in 2010 Booth said [...] "I took time off boxing because I was too drunk...No manager would look at me and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> were shut. I'd go on these mad binges and spend loads of money." [...] After earning £10,000 in his fight with Damaen Kelly, Booth had spent the money on a combination of drink and drugs with the money disappearing within six weeks. Speaking about his addiction, Booth said that drink had always been a part of family life but the suicide of his sister Deana had hit him particularly hard. Booth said, [...] "It was too young to die. She was a funloving girl. I don’t know why she did it. She got run over when she was young. She’d had a tragic time. It mentally disturbed me." [...] Two weeks later, following the tragedy, Booth fought and beat the Bulgarian boxer Dimitar Alipiev whilst drunk, saying, [...] "I wanted to fight because I didn’t {{know what to do with}} myself after Deana died. I was drinking on the day of the fight. I was numb. I was in no pain. I just didn’t care. It was the only time in my life I didn’t care." [...] It was Booth's 12th professional contest. Booth said that he also fell into bad company: [...] "I was in parks and dosshouses. I was British champion but walking around with drunks and thinking they were mates. I’d get up, drink cider and top up during the day. Sometimes, I’d get a bottle of cheap vodka and walk around with it in my pocket." [...] Eventually Booth checked into an alcohol clinic and begun the process of getting clean: [...] "It frightened me and I wanted to stop, but it was only when my body rejected the drink that I found the courage. My stomach packed in. I was sicking blood every morning." [...] He began training once more with trainer Tony Harris and began to rebuild his boxing career despite occasionally relapsing into drink. Eventually he gave up drinking altogether, saying, [...] "I’m one of those who has to be abstinent, because one drink isn’t going to do anything for me except start it all again." ...|$|E
