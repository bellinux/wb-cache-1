500|$|Howard Blake recalls: [...] "I {{went to a}} {{viewing and}} saw that the film was very profound, with a serious anti-war theme, but a certain amount of 'found' choral music had already been laid in by the editors...I {{explained}} that I loved the film <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> choral/orchestral music worked brilliantly but it was very big and rich and I felt a score would have to emerge from it and be very pure and expressive and quite small — and that I could only hear this in my head as done by strings only." ...|$|E
500|$|Arjona {{wrote the}} song for his mother, Noemí Morales. She {{told him she}} didn't like it because it make her cry. He said that he [...] "wrote the song {{as a gift for}} my mom in a Mother's Day and two sisters (a couple of years ago) [...] <b>and</b> <b>i</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> idea of {{including}} it on the album was very good". Lyrically, [...] "Mi Novia Se Me Esta Poniendo Vieja" [...] revolves around how a son looks at their mother from a sentimental perspective, with Arjona singing [...] "She loves me either if i gor as a guerrilla, or I won the Nobel Prize for Peace / She does't care if i'm last or first, if i'm going as a conformist or as tenacious." [...] He also said that he never thought to include the song in an album, just as happened with his single [...] "Señora De Las Cuatro Decadas" [...] from Historias back in 1994.|$|E
500|$|Ralf Schumacher said, [...] "I'm {{more than}} happy; {{we have been}} strong here the whole weekend and my car behaved perfectly. I had a little moment of worry about six laps from the end when the {{throttle}} didn't seem to pick up properly <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> engine was going to stop, but it came back and all was well." [...] Schumacher added that his team was confident of securing third in the Constructors' Championship; although he could not match Häkkinen's pace, he praised the team for his car's set-up. Coulthard was disappointed with his fourth-place finish, and thought his team's decision to call him into the pit lane after his competitors cost him the victory; however, he remained confident about his championship chances. Button was also disappointed to finish fifth: [...] "It was a bad race for me, if not the worst. The car was working well at the start, but when I tried to pass Jarno I went in a bit late." [...] Trulli refused to criticise Button after the race, believing that Button made a mistake. Fisichella and Verstappen felt similarly about their lap-nine collision, with Fisichella saying that he [...] "felt sorry" [...] for Verstappen and describing his weekend as [...] "disastrous". Verstappen said that he struggled with his car's balance, which resulted in oversteer. He was [...] "happy to go home", because [...] "it's not been a good weekend." [...] Frentzen said that although {{he was happy to}} score points, he had hoped for a better finish.|$|E

500|$|Clive Russell, who portrayed Blackfish, {{spoke about}} working with Gwendoline Christie as Brienne of Tarth, noting [...] "There's {{something}} very curious, by the way, I'm probably about 6'6" [...] tall. I think she's about 6'3", but all the time I worked with her, I {{felt like she was}} taller than me. Now I don't really know what {{that has to do with}} it. It might be something to do with being confronted by a physically charismatic very tall woman, or maybe it's that she's caught the impressiveness of the character of that woman, that soldier. She's also an extraordinarily hilarious woman. We had great fun together. It was great fun to play." [...] Gwendoline Christie also spoke about filming with Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who portrays Jaime Lannister, again, saying [...] "I was excited, It was really fun to be with Nikolaj again, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> way of which their reunion happens is not really expected. I just loved that it was so formal, because within the confines of such formality, and having to negotiate with each other, there are so many other stories begging to be told in those moments. There's a slow process of creeping familiarity among two people who haven't been together for a long time; it was allowed to build." [...] Coster-Waldau also spoke about their first reunion scene, stating [...] "It's a great scene. These characters are so much about holding their cards so close to their chest and they don't want to reveal how they're feeling. But we know there's history between them, that this is more than two knights meeting. But they would never acknowledge that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Udwin {{has said}} it was the protests in {{response}} to the rape that drew her to make this film. [...] "I was absolutely awestruck by the ordinary men and women of India who poured out onto the streets in response to this horrific gang rape and who demanded change for women's rights. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> least I could do was amplify their voices." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{her role}} as Nova was expanded, the sequel was a disappointing rush to {{production}} {{to capitalize on the}} original. Harrison's character eked out one word before she was shot to death, but nothing fresh was added.The budget was half that of Planet of the Apes. Director Ted Post said, [...] "It moved basically as an entertainment piece, nothing more." [...] Post wanted the script rewritten. [...] "I was very unhappy with the script, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> script was far from what it should have been. The story was unclear, and didn't measure up." [...] On his first reading of the script for Beneath the Planet of the Apes, star James Franciscus phoned Charlton Heston. [...] "Jesus Christ, Chuck," [...] he said, [...] "have you read this piece of crap?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! I {{knew you}} to be a man, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> knew <b>the</b> whine of the hound, too," [...] she {{answered}} hastily, as if willing to explain she knew not what, and then checking herself, like one fearful of having already said too much.|$|R

I {{made the}} woman let me in, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> sat where poor Camilla {{used to talk}} to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was <b>the</b> better for facing it out. The {{question}} is whether Mrs. Poynsett will dislike it. She {{has a right to}} be consulted." ...|$|R
2500|$|Carey {{attributed}} his subdued {{reaction to}} the perfect bid by saying, [...] "Everybody thought someone had cheated. We'd just fired Roger Dobkowitz, and all the fan groups were upset about it. ... I remember asking, 'Are we ever going to air this?' And nobody could see how we could. So I thought the show {{was never going to}} air. I thought somebody had cheated us, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> whole show was over. I {{thought they were going to}} shut us down, and I thought I was going to be out of a job." [...] Kniess later defended his actions, claiming that he never cheated, and in the end, was awarded his prizes. (His feat can be comparable to the actions of Michael Larson, who appeared on the CBS 1980s game show Press Your Luck, and won $110,237 by memorizing the board sequence.) ...|$|E
2500|$|... “For Christmas {{when we were}} kids, {{ironically}} Dia got {{the guitar}} and I got the karaoke machine. We quickly learned, however, what we were natural at and destined to become. She became really focused on her voice and began singing little country ditties at local county fairs and retirement centers. I started out playing whatever was on the radio or whatever {{happened to be in}} my buddies' CD player. My dad was a DJ in his early twenties so he had quite an extensive record collection that I listened to occasionally. After I experienced my first heartbreak <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> world was going to end, the natural way to console my tattered heart was to write a song. Of course my parents, being the supportive and loving caretakers they are, showered me with much undeserved praise and encouraged me to keep writing. My sister and I heeded their advice and began writing and playing original songs together." [...] – Meg ...|$|E
2500|$|The Titans {{were the}} first NFL team to play a preseason game, in the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game on August 9, 2009. Ringer played his NFL debut there. Ringer {{discussed}} the game earlier, saying, [...] "I am very excited. I have never even been to an NFL game as a fan, so my first experience I {{am going to be}} playing in one, I am looking forward to it." [...] Ringer had 4 carries for 14 yards, along with 2 catches for 9 yards, while the Titans won 21-18. On August 15, in a preseason game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Ringer lead the team in rushing with 7 attempts for 51 yards, including a 36 yard touchdown run. The Titans won 27-20. Ringer said of the run, [...] " [...] I saw a linebacker prepare to blitz, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> offense was going to check out of the play. But as the cadence kept going, I realized we were going to run into that blitz". In a 10-30 loss against the Dallas Cowboys, the first game in Cowboys Stadium, Ringer again led the team in rushing, this time with 33 yards on 5 attempts. He had what would have been a 17-yard touchdown run called back due to a penalty. He also had 2 catches for 6 yards, and averaged 34 yards on two kickoff return.|$|E
