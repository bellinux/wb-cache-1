5|$|Keith {{meets with}} Principal Clemmons and finds Veronica in the closet. Veronica talks to Mr. Wu {{about one of}} his students, Peter, who had {{feelings}} for Mr. Wu. However, Mr. Wu is not gay. That night, Veronica has a dream about Peter, who “asks” her why he would even {{want to go to}} a baseball stadium. Veronica talks to Beaver, who was pushed into a wall by Cervando, a PCHer who died in the bus crash. Keith solves a case for Principal Clemmons <b>about</b> <b>students</b> who get diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder from the same doctor for better grades. Angie wins the experiment competition, and we learn that Angie was one of the students who was diagnosed with GAD for money. Principal Clemmons revokes exceptions for GAD students. Veronica has a dream about Cervando, who says that the perpetrator was probably in the vicinity of the bus crash. Veronica learns that the “I am God” image is actually an album cover. Keith tells Veronica that the perpetrator was probably targeting Dick and Beaver. Veronica has another, more frightening dream.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{publication}} in 1999, Battle Royale became a bestseller in Japan. The novel was earlier {{entered into the}} 1997 Japan Horror Fiction Awards, but was eventually rejected {{in the final round}} with no winner that year. All three members of the final round's selection committee that year admitted Battle Royale was the best work, but declined to award it due to its controversial content. Hiroshi Aramata said that while it was the best nominee in terms of [...] "story, structure, and subject matter," [...] he felt it {{was too much of a}} Kinpachi-sensei parody and suspected its content would cause problems. Katsuhiko Takahashi felt that although it was the superior work as far as its construction as a novel, giving the award to a story <b>about</b> <b>students</b> killing each other at [...] "this time" [...] would hurt the reputation of the competition. Mariko Hayashi said that while she believed it was the best of the four novels, it was like reading an [...] "unpleasant near-future manga" [...] and [...] "No matter how squarely it might be horror or how interesting it might be, I'm not so sure we should be writing stories like this." [...] In 2001, Kōji Ōnuma wrote , a dissertation that explores the themes of the book.|$|E

The series was invented and produced by Semyon Slepakov and Vyacheslav Dusmukhametov; [...] Pyotr Tochilin, director of the notorious [...] "Internet comedy" [...] "Khottabych", was invited to direct the project: ...|$|E

2500|$|Social {{media has}} also {{facilitated}} {{the spread of}} blackface in culture. In 2016, a controversy emerged over Snapchat's Bob Marley filter, which allowed users to superimpose dark skin, dreadlocks, and a knitted cap over their own faces. A number of controversies have also emerged <b>about</b> <b>students</b> at American universities sharing images of themselves appearing to wear blackface makeup. Additionally, writer Victoria Princewill criticized non-black people sharing animated images of black people or black-skinned emojis, calling the practice [...] "digital blackface".|$|E
2500|$|Information <b>about</b> <b>students</b> is {{generally}} kept private {{in keeping with}} the 1974 [...] "Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act" [...] which prohibits colleges from releasing information about their students without student permission. Accordingly, parents can not learn about their son's or daughter's grades unless a waiver is signed permitting release of such information. The privacy policy can sometimes lead to problems, particularly when students have mental health problems but the school is prevented legally from contacting parents. In 2002, one Allegheny student committed suicide, and his parents sued the school; a jury in 2006 found that the school was not liable or negligent. This case helped focus national attention on the competing issues of student privacy and parental rights.|$|E
2500|$|Barnes & Noble {{selected}} High School Confidential {{as one of}} its ten recommended new titles, {{and called}} the book [...] "outrageously entertaining," [...] saying, [...] "We give High School Confidential a resounding A+ for its irresistible smarty-pants tone and its surprising revelations <b>about</b> <b>students</b> and teachers alike." [...] A.J. Hammer of CNN's Showbiz Tonight praised the work, and said [...] "really nothing could compare to Jeremy Iversen's experience of posing as a student," [...] calling the book [...] "a fascinating read." [...] High School Confidential made the Top 50 at Barnes & Nobleand out of over 2.5 million titles at Amazon.com, it ranked among the Top 100, where customers voted it four out of five stars.|$|E

2500|$|... "Principles and Standards for School Mathematics" [...] was {{championed by}} educators, administrators and some mathematicians as raising {{standards}} for all students, {{but it was}} criticized by some for valuing understanding processes more than learning standard procedures. Parents, educators and some mathematicians opposing reform mathematics complained <b>about</b> <b>students</b> becoming confused and frustrated, claiming {{that it was an}} inefficient style of instruction characterized by frequent false starts. Proponents of reform mathematics countered that research showed that, when done correctly, students in reform math curricula learned basic math skills at least as well as those in traditional programs, and additionally understood the underlying concepts much better. Communities that adopted reform curricula generally saw increased math scores by their students. [...] However, one study has found that first-grade students with a below-average aptitude in math responded best to teacher-directed instruction.|$|E
2500|$|The Court {{warned the}} {{students}} not to delay contacting their families because the Court {{was going to}} write them promptly. Dean Greenough wrote to Roberts: [...] "The letter that I am sending to your father this morning, although it does not tell him everything, necessitates your telling him everything." [...] To Kenneth Day he wrote: [...] "It {{would be better for}} them to hear it from you than from me." [...] The Dean's letters <b>about</b> <b>students</b> who had committed no overt act explained the circumstances at length and provided he Court's rationale for expulsion in such cases: [...] "The acts in question are so unspeakably gross that the intimates of those who commit these acts become tainted." [...] He made a clear distinction by not criticizing such a student's character, but his judgment, calling him [...] "no worse than ignorant, over-curious, and careless." [...] When it came to those who had engaged in homosexual sex, Greenough withheld details yet tried to underscore the significance of the violation. To Roberts' father, Greenough wrote that his son [...] "has promised to tell you all about the matter, and I hope he will tell you the whole truth. His offense {{has nothing to do with}} low scholarship; it is not gambling, or drink or ordinary sexual intercourse. If he does not confess to something worse than these things, he will not have told you the whole story." ...|$|E
6000|$|Sellar's {{treatment}} {{of his students}} was always that of a fine gentleman. Few got near him; all respected him. At times he was addressed in an unknown tongue, but he kept his countenance. He was particular <b>about</b> <b>students</b> keeping to their proper benches, and once thought he had caught a swarthy north countryman straying. [...] "You are in your wrong seat, Mr. Orr." [...] "Na, am richt eneuch." [...] "You {{should be in the}} seat in front. That is bench 12, and you are entered on bench 10." [...] "Eh? This is no bench twal, [counting] twa, fower, sax, aucht, ten." [...] "There is something wrong." [...] "Oh-h-h, [with sudden enlightenment] ye've been coontin' the first dask; we dinna coont the first dask." [...] The professor knew the men he had to deal with too well to scorn this one, {{who turned out to be}} a fine fellow. He was the only man I ever knew who ran his medical and arts classes together, and so many lectures had he to attend daily that he mixed them up. He graduated, however, in both faculties in five years, and the last I heard of him was that, when applying for a medical assistantship, he sent his father's photograph because he did not have one of himself. He was a man of brains as well as sinew, and dined briskly on a shilling a week.|$|E
