5|$|However, {{there is}} <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> {{aggressiveness}} and over-aggressiveness at takeoff. One {{of the most}} common mistakes made by athletes, including those at world class level, is to raise the ski tips too much during the transition. This excessive angle of attack causes the skis to act more as a spoiler than an efficient aerodynamic device, resulting in more height than distance; a flight curve that is too steep or shallow is unfavourable. In a well-executed jump, athletes will spend several seconds longer in the air than in ski jumping – up to five seconds more – which requires a different level of skill in order to sustain flight for a longer period, and showcases how the role of aerodynamics is magnified in ski flying. Not all athletes who excel in ski jumping are able do so in ski flying (see the section on specialists), and it can be difficult for them to hone their skills in the latter due to the hills being off-limits when competitions are not staged.|$|E

25|$|Marketing for organ {{donation}} must walk <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> stressing {{the need for}} {{organ donation}} and not being too forceful. If the marketing agent is too forceful, then {{the target of the}} message will react defensively to the request. According to psychological reactance theory, a person will perceive their freedom threatened and will react to restore the freedom. According to Ashley Anker, the use of transportation theory has a positive effect on target reactions by marketing attempts. When public service announcements use recipient-focused messages, targets were more transported. Individuals who watched recipient-focused messages were more transported because potential donors experience empathy for the potential recipient. Future public service announcements should use recipient-focused stories to elicit relationship formation between potential donors and recipients.|$|E
25|$|The cost of {{insurance}} has been a primary motivation in the reform of the US healthcare system, and many different explanations have been proposed in the reasons for high insurance costs and how to remedy them. One critique and motivation for healthcare reform has been {{the development of the}} medical–industrial complex. This relates to moral arguments for health care reform, framing healthcare as a social good, one that is fundamentally immoral to deny to people based on economic status. The motivation behind healthcare reform in response to the medical-industrial complex also stems from issues of social inequity, promotion of medicine over preventative care. The medical-industrial complex, defined as a network of health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, and the like, plays a role in the complexity of the US insurance market and <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> government and industry within it. Likewise, critiques {{of insurance}} markets being conducted under a capitalistic, free-market model also include that medical solutions, as opposed to preventative healthcare measures, are promoted to maintain this medical-industrial complex. Arguments for a market-based approach to health insurance include the Grossman model, which is based on an ideal competitive model, but others have critiqued this, arguing that fundamentally, this means that people in higher socioeconomic levels will receive a better quality of healthcare.|$|E
25|$|His time as Viceroy {{was marked}} with {{consistent}} calls for self-government, which Chelmsford agreed to, convincing a preoccupied Foreign Office {{to send the}} Secretary of State for India, Edwin Samuel Montagu, to discuss the potential for reform. Together they oversaw {{the implementation of the}} Montagu-Chelmsford reforms, which gave greater authority to local Indian representative bodies and paved the way for a free India. Trying to tread <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> reform and maintaining the British hold over India, Chelmsford passed repressive anti-terrorism laws to widespread opposition from Indian reformists. The laws sparked unrest in the Punjab, culminating in the implementation of martial law in the region and the Amritsar Massacre by General Reginald Dyer on 13 April 1919. Initially supportive of Dyer and slow to respond to the massacre, following a ruling condemning Dyers actions, Chelmsford eventually disciplined Dyer. This was however, seen by Indian Nationalists as too little, too late and the Indian National Congress boycotted the first regional elections in 1920. In addition to this, the Third Anglo-Afghan War broke out and Gandhi started his first campaign. On his return to Britain on 15 June 1921, he was elevated to Viscount as 1st Viscount Chelmsford of Chelmsford, County of Essex.|$|E

The first mascot appeared in 1955 and was a papier-mâché Spartan head made by Theta Xi fraternity brothers Donald Pais, Kenneth Roberts, and Don Bauer. By the 1956 Rose Bowl Game, the papier-mâché head had been replaced by a fiberglass version that was thirty pounds lighter. In 1985, MSU Alumni Association Graphic Designer Dave Giordan was asked to draw a muscular Sparty in full body armor. Four years later, in 1989, a group came together to design and revamp the Sparty mascot. Research was conducted on Michigan State’s mission, community, and traditions. The result was an “approachable, fierce yet kind, man for all seasons” mascot. Sparty would reflect the university’s strength and character. To introduce MSU's new mascot, six billboards were positioned around East Lansing announcing his Spartan Stadium debut. The costume, with a cartoonishly oversized head, bulging muscles, and a facial expression that treads <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> cute and pugnacious, was introduced to MSU fans during the 1989 football season.

Early every calendar year, tryouts are held for the student to portray Sparty for the upcoming school year.|$|E

Because of the politically correct society we live in currently, there's been an increase in calling out insensitive costumes and portrayals.
