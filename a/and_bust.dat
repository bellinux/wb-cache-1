5|$|The {{history of}} private equity and venture {{capital and the}} {{development}} of these asset classes has occurred through a series of boom <b>and</b> <b>bust</b> cycles since the middle of the 20th century. Within the broader private equity industry, two distinct sub-industries, leveraged buyouts and venture capital experienced growth along parallel, although interrelated tracks.|$|E
5|$|Wasps {{have been}} {{modelled}} in jewellery {{since at least}} the nineteenth century, when diamond and emerald wasp brooches were made in gold and silver settings. A fashion for wasp waisted female silhouettes with sharply cinched waistlines emphasizing the wearer's hips <b>and</b> <b>bust</b> arose repeatedly in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.|$|E
5|$|Though {{sometimes}} productive, no {{nineteenth century}} iron mine on the Brendon Hills was profitable and the venture {{as a whole}} was financially ruinous. Furthermore, the industry {{as a whole was}} prone to boom <b>and</b> <b>bust,</b> with a sharp decline from the early 1880s. The railway continued in operation after the end of mining, although it had lost its primary traffic. A second-hand Robey semi-portable steam engine was installed {{at the head of the}} incline to power the drums, hauling wagons up in the absence of a regular downhill flow.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} adds to {{the literature}} on asset price booms <b>and</b> <b>busts</b> in three self-contained chapters. The first chapter presents a novel explanation {{for the existence of}} stock price booms <b>and</b> <b>busts,</b> based on subjective expectations about future stock prices. This explanation is in line with survey evidence on the expectations of representative U. S. households and allows to match the behavior of postwar U. S. stock prices. The second chapter shows that, in the presence of belief-driven booms <b>and</b> <b>busts,</b> a financial transaction tax may lead to higher stock price volatility by increasing the likelihood of booms <b>and</b> <b>busts.</b> The third chapter analyzes the efficiency of investment professionals’ expectations and documents key differences to the expectations of representative households...|$|R

5|$|Abir's rubber {{gathering}} practices made it {{the most}} notorious of all the concession companies for human rights abuses in the Congo Free State. Abir was only involved with primary resource gathering and, despite being owned by European industrialists, operated in a style similar to warlords such as Tippu Tip. Abir was supported in its operations by the Free State which required the enormous profits generated to strengthen its control over the country during its formative years. The concession companies gave the Free State the time and revenue required to secure the Congo and to plan a long-term and more stable program of colonisation. Abir ultimately failed as its harvesting process valued high production over sustainability and it doomed to live out its own boom <b>and</b> <b>bust</b> cycle. Despite this the Abir production model {{was used by the}} French government as the basis for its concession system in the French Congo.|$|E

25|$|The old {{county court}} house {{served as a}} {{temporary}} school. After a few more students started answering roll call in 1927, a rickety-board school house was erected, which was occupied by Miss Helen Frame as the teacher. This structure was located on Campbell Street directly south and on the same lot as the existing Kermit ISD archives building. The current archives building once served as the cafeteria in the first public school building. In 1927, Hendrick No. 1, {{the name of the}} discovery well in Hendrick Field south of Kermit was completed and oil was discovered in Winkler County–the county that was to boom <b>and</b> <b>bust,</b> boom <b>and</b> <b>bust,</b> until prosperity came in with discovery of deep oil.|$|E
