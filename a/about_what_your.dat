It {{profiles}} Sigurður and his quest to obtain a human penis for the museum, telling the story of the American and Icelandic donors and examining the quasi-taboo nature of the museum's collection. Bekhor says: [...] "I wouldn't say it's a Rorschach test, but depending on how you react to it really says a lot <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> relationship is with that element of the human anatomy. It's a really interesting phenomenon and we're really curious to see how audiences respond." [...] The film premiered on 1 May 2012 at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival.|$|E

Walker responded jokingly, [...] "Well, we did it before, if we need to do it again, I don't have a qualm about it."

5000|$|Original Air Date—10 April 2011 The 11 {{remaining}} girls hit {{the runway}} for an amazing week. At panel {{one of the}} girls is eliminated. Another week cardiac output Paulette Acosta, Giselle dancing with the girls and the pace of Tito el Bambino marked the sixth show of Nuestra Belleza Latina 2011. The 11 participants were subjected to two major tests during the week: report from a construction site through any obstacle and a pole dancing sensual dance where they had to demonstrate their agility as athletes and dancers at the challenge of pole dancing. Pretty generally conductive, Giselle Blondet, is responsible for encouraging girls during the tests but this time wanted to show solidarity with them and learn the choreography of the show opening. The audience went crazy when Giselle went to the dance floor to shake your hips to the rhythm of mambo and demonstrate that if they compete, the girls would be in serious trouble to snatch the crown. This challenge was held secret for a week and eleven girls {{did not know what to}} expect when they arrived at the location, in miniskirts and heels. Once there were reported to be reported from a construction site without suspecting that the production would submit to all sorts of obstacles to measuring the calm before the cameras in front of unexpected situations. When Nuestra Belleza Latina participants were in full report at all surprised by the sound of a drilling machine that kept driving their interviews or listen to their interviews. All of them will cast a valde of water and mud as they were about to close his report that helped the jury to measure who responded and who are naturally frozen on camera. If you thought the treacherous catwalk last week was difficult, the challenges of this week confirmed that this competition is getting tougher. During the week the candidates had to rehearse sexy choreography, in which used as tools from chairs to a tube, activity that was not all easy because each had to demonstrate physical dexterity and could not always look as seductive as intended. Our dear Charytín was encouraging them and watching their development to qualify. Diana Cano was really distressed testing tube and surprised all with his shyness and concern <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> coworkers think of her Wall Street. Darla proved to be the most agile of the group, and a good companion to teach Gredmarie their best moves. After the challenges came time to decide. They announced the candidate with fewer votes from the public and the two who had received worse grades on the challenges. The girl with the fewest public votes was Paulette Acosta, and she joined Villa and Diana Cano Jocell with lower qualifications. It's time for the girls to save someone and no one would believe to be saved. Nothing more, nothing less than Diana Cano, the most direct of all participants. In front of the judges were Jocell and Paulette Villa Acosta, the latter being the judges decided to eliminate. We are consenting to our audience and because you asked Tito [...] "El Bambino" [...] will be responsible to make everyone dance to its rhythm. So do not forget to vote for your artist consented to appear at the next gala.The first intrigues and rivalries between Jocell Villa, Paulette Acosta, Diana Cano, Maribel Santiago, Nastassja Bolivar, Miriam Hernandez, Darla Delgado, Julieta Cabrera, Nicole Smith, Patricia Corcoran and Columbus Gredmarie have already emerged, but who of them will next to leave? Hopefully your good luck charms they can use to continue in the competition.|$|E
