5|$|I. orientalis, {{described}} by A. K. Rozhdestvensky in 1952, {{was based on}} poor material, but <b>a</b> <b>skull</b> with a distinctive arched snout that {{had been assigned to}} it was renamed Altirhinus kurzanovi in 1998. At the same time, I. orientalis was considered to be a nomen dubium because it cannot be compared to I. bernissartensis.|$|E
5|$|Only one native mammal {{remains on}} the islands, the large forest bat. The endemic Lord Howe long-eared bat is known only from <b>a</b> <b>skull</b> and is now presumed extinct, {{possibly}} {{the result of the}} introduction of ship rats.|$|E
5|$|The Morea {{expedition}} {{confirmed that}} the golden jackal existed in Greece. Although earlier travel narratives had mentioned its presence, these were not considered trustworthy. Moreover, the subspecies seen and described by the French (named Canis aureus moreotica) was endemic to the region. Bory de Saint-Vincent brought back pelts and <b>a</b> <b>skull.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{physical}} {{characteristics of the}} Mérens {{are the result of}} the harsh mountain environment where they live, and they are reminiscent of the horses in the cave drawings at Niaux, made some 13,000 years ago. These images depict animals with dense coats and <b>a</b> <b>skull</b> shaped like the modern Mérens, with a beard-like protrusion of hair under the jawbone.|$|E
5|$|Though Johnston {{did not see}} an okapi himself, he {{did manage}} to obtain pieces of striped skin and {{eventually}} <b>a</b> <b>skull.</b> From this skull, the okapi was correctly classified as a relative of the giraffe; in 1901, the species was formally recognized as Okapia johnstoni.|$|E
5|$|Another sauropod of the Nemegt-Formation, Nemegtosaurus, {{is known}} only from <b>a</b> <b>skull.</b> Opisthocoelicaudia, {{on the other}} hand, lacks both the skull and neck, precluding a direct {{comparison}} and leading to suspicions that it may represent a synonym of Nemegtosaurus. According to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), the oldest name has priority over younger synonyms – if Opisthocoelicaudia would {{be shown to be}} a synonym of Nemegtosaurus, the name Nemegtosaurus would remain valid while Opisthocoelicaudia would become invalid.|$|E

5|$|Apatosaurus louisae {{was named}} by Holland in 1916, being first known from a partial {{skeleton}} {{that was found}} in Utah. The holotype is CM3018, with referred specimens including CM3378, CM11162, and LACM52844. The former two consist of a vertebral column; the latter two consist of <b>a</b> <b>skull</b> and a nearly complete skeleton, respectively. Apatosaurus louisae specimens all come from the late Kimmeridgian of Dinosaur National Monument. In 2015 Tschopp etal. found the type specimen of Apatosaurus laticollis to nest closely with CM3018, meaning the former is likely a junior synonym of A.louisae.|$|E
5|$|Euchambersia is a genus of therocephalian therapsid {{that lived}} during the Late Permian, {{approximately}} 255 million years ago, {{in what is}} now South Africa. The genus contains a single species, E. mirabilis, named by paleontologist Robert Broom in 1931 from <b>a</b> <b>skull</b> missing the lower jaws; a second skull, belonging to an immature individual, was later described. It {{is a member of the}} family Akidnognathidae, which historically has also been referred by as the synonymous Euchambersiidae (named after Euchambersia).|$|E

It was expected that Higginbotham would eventually move unless Derby did well enough to gain promotion back to the Premier League, and so in January 2003, with Derby struggling in the First Division, he moved to Southampton on loan, joining permanently in February.|$|E

5|$|PVSJ 407, a Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis, had a pit in <b>a</b> <b>skull</b> bone {{attributed}} by Paul Sereno and Novas to a bite. Two additional pits {{occurred on}} the splenial. The areas around these pits are swollen and porous, suggesting the wounds were afflicted by a short-lived non-lethal infection. Because of the size and angles of the wound, {{it is likely that}} they were obtained in a fight with another Herrerasaurus.|$|E
5|$|Several {{juvenile}} Psittacosaurus {{have been}} found. The smallest is a P. mongoliensis hatchling conserved in the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), {{which is only}} 11 to 13centimetres (4–5inches) long, with <b>a</b> <b>skull</b> 2.8centimetres (1in) in length. Another hatchling skull at the AMNH is only 4.6centimetres (1.8inches) long. Both specimens are from Mongolia. Juveniles discovered in the Yixian Formation are approximately {{the same age as}} the larger AMNH specimen.|$|E
5|$|Spinosaurus {{has long}} been {{depicted}} in popular books about dinosaurs, although only recently has there been enough information about spinosaurids for an accurate depiction. After an influential 1955 skeletal reconstruction by Lapparent and Lavocat based on a 1936 diagram by Stromer, it has been treated as a generalized upright theropod, with <b>a</b> <b>skull</b> {{similar to that of}} other large theropods and a sail on its back, even having four-fingered hands.|$|E

5|$|Subarachnoid blood can be {{detected}} on CT scanning {{in as many as}} 60 percent of people with traumatic brain injury. Traumatic SAH (tSAH) usually occurs near the site of <b>a</b> <b>skull</b> fracture or intracerebral contusion. It usually happens in the setting of other forms of traumatic brain injury and has been linked with a poorer prognosis. It is unclear, however, if this {{is a direct result of}} the SAH or whether the presence of subarachnoid blood is simply an indicator of severity of the head injury and the prognosis is determined by other associated mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|The Temple of Tohil {{was used}} for human sacrifice, {{the bodies of the}} {{sacrificial}} victims were probably hurled down the front stairway before being decapitated and the heads places on <b>a</b> <b>skull</b> rack.

5|$|The current {{whereabouts}} of the holotype beak are unknown. It may be specimen UMZC 575, a rostrum {{that was sent}} from Milne-Edwards to the English zoologist Alfred Newton after 1880, which matches the drawing and description in Milne-Edwards' paper, but this cannot be confirmed. In 1893 the ornithologists Edward Newton (brother of Alfred) and Hans Gadow described more fossils of the Rodrigues parrot, including <b>a</b> <b>skull</b> and limb bones. Remains of the species are scarce, and subfossils have been discovered in caves on the Plaine Corail and in Caverne Tortue.|$|E
5|$|The form peragrus {{is known}} from further south in Mexico, in the Río Verde basin of San Luis Potosi, {{the state of}} Hidalgo, and far {{northern}} Veracruz. Late Pleistocene fossils of this form {{have been found in}} Cueva de Abre, Tamaulipas. According to Goldman, it is intermediate in color between O.c.aquaticus and O.c.couesi, but has <b>a</b> <b>skull</b> similar to that of aquaticus.|$|E
5|$|The {{front part}} of <b>a</b> <b>skull</b> (specimen NMP P6V-004389, a syntype of this species) in the National Museum of Prague {{was found in}} 1850 among {{the remains of the}} Böhmisches Museum. Other {{elements}} supposedly belonging to this specimen have been listed in the literature, but it appears only the partial skull was ever present.
