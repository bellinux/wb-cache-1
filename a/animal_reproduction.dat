A study of over 600,000 pregnancies in Denmark found that ondansetron during pregnancy {{was not associated with}} a significantly increased risk of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, major birth defect, preterm birth, low birth weight, or small for gestational age. Other studies concluded that there is an increase in major congenital malformations due to an increase in heart problems among the babies.|$|E

The Colorado Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES) was established in 1888 in accordance with provisions of the Hatch Act of 1887, calling for experiment stations at land-grant universities. State and federal funds support CAES research programs. In 2007, research activities included pest management, food safety and nutrition, environmental quality, plant and animal production systems, and community and rural development. The NSF Engineering Research Center for Extreme Ultra Violet Science and Technology, funded by the National Science Foundation, partners industry with Colorado State University, CU-Boulder, and the University of California-Berkeley. The center has three research thrusts in Engineered EUV Sources, Imaging, Patterning, and Metrology, and Novel Linear and Non-Linear Spectroscopies The Colorado Center for Biorefining and Biofuels (C2B2) is the first research center created under the umbrella of the new Colorado Renewable Energy Collaboratory, involving CSU, CU, Colorado School of Mines, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The center develops biofuels and bio-refining technologies.|$|E

50|$|Differences between {{plant and}} <b>animal</b> {{physiology}} and <b>reproduction</b> cause minor {{differences in how}} they evolve.|$|R
40|$|In most <b>animals</b> <b>reproduction</b> trades {{off with}} somatic {{maintenance}} and survival. Physiologically this trade-off is mediated by hormones with opposite {{effects on reproduction}} and maintenance. In many insects, this regulation is achieved by an endocrine network that integrates insulin-like/IGF- 1 signaling (IIS), juvenile hormone (JH), and the yolk precursor vitellogenin (Vg) (or, more generally, yolk proteins [YPs]). Downregulation of this network promotes maintenance and survival {{at the expense of}} reproduction. Remarkably, however, queens of highly eusocial social insects exhibit both enormous reproductive output and longevity, thus escaping the trade-off. Here we argue - based on recent evidence - that the proximate reason for why eusocial insects can decouple this trade-off is that they have evolved a different 'wiring' of the IIS-JH-Vg/YP circuit...|$|R

2500|$|In 1905, the zoo's first director, William T. Hornaday, {{along with}} President Theodore Roosevelt and other conservationalists, created the American Bison Society (ABS) {{in an attempt}} to save the American bison from extinction. The bison had been {{depleted}} from tens-of-millions of animals to only a few hundred {{by the end of the}} 19th century due to westward expansion. The society worked to breed the species in captivity as well as raise public awareness, raise money to create protected reserves, and reintroduce bison back into the wild. On October 11, 1907, the first reintroduction of bison began when the zoo sent six males and nine females, by rail, to the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge in Oklahoma. Seven days later, the animals were successfully reintroduced to the park. By 1935, the society, who had successfully carried out several more reintroductions from bison kept in zoos and ranches, considered their work done and disbanded that year. In 2005, the Wildlife Conservation Society resurrected and re-purposed the ABS to, [...] "help build the social and scientific foundations for the ecological restoration of bison," [...] and, [...] "restore bison ecologically, not just animals in pens but actual functioning animals in the larger landscape," [...] (Keith Aune, WCS Bison Coordinator). According to a study published in 2012, virtually all wild and captive bison in the United States are hybrids with cattle genes, with the exception of the two distinct breeding populations within Yellowstone National Park and their descendants. The cattle genes entered the bison population due to private ranchers hybridizing their bison to make them more docile, with some of these animals being accidentally reintroduced by the ABS. In response, in the fall of 2011, the WCS arranged for a herd of female bison originating from the American Prairie Reserve to be sent to the Colorado State University's <b>Animal</b> <b>Reproduction</b> & Biotechnology Laboratory to be used as surrogates {{in an attempt to}} transfer the fertilized embryos of genetically pure bison. After an ultrasound showed one female to be pregnant, the herd was moved to the zoo where, on June 20, 2012, the calf was born. The herd is kept in an off-exhibit section of the zoo and the goal is to eventually create a breeding herd of genetically pure bison through embryo transfers with the surrogate hybrid bison.|$|E
