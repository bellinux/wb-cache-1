A system used for the remotion of the contaminants from the compartment, based on an <b>extraction</b> <b>duct,</b> was projected using a simple, unidimensional flow model with capability to predict the air exchange rate {{as a function of}} the vehicle velocity. Some tests using tracer gas methods were performed in a real vehicle with the contaminant remotion system mounted, in order to validate the calculation model and evaluate the performances of the system.

50|$|Certain plants (e.g. most {{strains of}} cannabis) emit a {{distinctive}} odor during their reproductive phase. This presents difficulties {{to those who}} are cultivating in places where it is illegal, or for growers who may prefer discretion for other reasons. The most common way of eliminating odor is by pulling odorous air through a carbon filter. Many cultivators simply attach a large carbon filter to their <b>air</b> <b>extraction</b> system, thereby filtering any smell before the air is expelled from the grow-room. Another way of eliminating odor is by installing an ozone generator in the <b>extraction</b> <b>ducting.</b> The <b>air</b> is forced past the ozone generator by the extraction fan, and the odorous air is neutralized as it mixes with the ozone; however the cultivator must ensure that the air is thoroughly mixed before it is expelled outside, lest some odor escape. Care must be taken to prevent excessive ozone concentrations in the garden itself, or where it might be inhaled by the grower or his/her family. Ozone itself has a distinctive smell and is harmful to living things, although the molecule breaks down quickly (20 minutes to an hour) in atmospheric conditions.|$|R

40|$|Based on the {{analysis}} {{results from the}} patent search and review of domestic and foreign publications in variable cycle engines (VCE) was created a classification of the possible schematic diagrams of VCE realizing three-stream engine technologies (the adaptive low pressure compressor (LPC) with <b>air</b> <b>extraction</b> behind stages, FLADE compressor, various feeding types of <b>extraction</b> <b>air</b> to the flowing path of the engine, etc.). To estimate a three-stream engine application {{as a part of}} the power-plant (PP) efficiency, was chosen an adaptive LPC technology scheme with the third contour air bypass beyond the critical section of a basic jet nozzle for which a mathematical model (MM) of the PP has been created on the basis of one-dimensional MM of the engine. The MM of the PP included 3 D modeling results of the air inlet, the LPC with various <b>air</b> <b>extractions</b> to the third contour, and the jet nozzle taking into account the interaction between the basic stream and the third contour stream. The predicted performance of an air inlet have been used to estimate the changes in a total pressure restoration coefficient and an additional resistance coefficient along «a fluid contour» when <b>air</b> <b>extraction</b> is included in the third contour in several cruiser modes of flight. An integrated characteristic of the LPC has been received at various points and levels of <b>air</b> <b>extraction</b> to the third contour, and parameters of extracted air (depending on the point and amount of <b>air</b> <b>extraction,</b> and also on the fan operating mode) have been calculated. When analyzing the obtained calculation results, the effect of pressure lines displacement to the right (towards the large reduced rates), growth of efficiency values, and also position displacement of its maximum value to the left (towards the descent reduced rates) has been found. To estimate how <b>air</b> <b>extraction</b> of the third contour between the plates of an adjustable supersonic nozzle impacts on its aft deck resistance various parameters of the flowing out air in subsonic cruiser mode of flight have been calculated. As a result of calculations according to the PP MM, under near-the-earth conditions of the subsonic cruiser flight, the effective specific fuel consumption has been reduced by 12, 5 %. The results reached allow us to expect significant subsonic effective fuel conservation of the three-stream engine. To prove the calculated results it is further necessary to achieve them under full-scale conditions using the engine-demonstrator. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the industrial problem of air current segregation in alumina storage silos which occurs with {{the handling of}} the feedstock alumina in aluminium plants. One significant parameter, the <b>air</b> <b>extraction</b> rate, was studied in an experimental silo which was manufactured for this purpose. The experiments conducted in small scale devices displayed the interaction between the particle flow and air current segregation. Results from these experiments show that the increase of the silo <b>air</b> <b>extraction</b> rate reduces <b>air</b> current segregation. The dimensional analysis method has been applied to form dimensionless groups out of the significant parameters. Five dimensionless groups were obtained which is unwieldy. To reduce the number of dimensionless groups the physical properties were lumped into the terminal velocity. This simplified approach gives three dimensionless groups.

40|$|Air current {{segregation}} (ACS) is one segregation {{phenomenon that}} has been identified to contribute significantly to the separation of fines(particlesb 42 μm) from coarse material during the filling of industrial silos. This paper describes investigations of ACS for alumina powder based on experiments conducted in an industrial silo, in the laboratory and by computation, using the commercial computational fluid dynamics code Fluent. For the industrial silo, the extent of ACS has been measured using the accumulation of fine material at the wall as an indicator. Based on these results, modifications to the feeding system were undertaken which showed that ACS is promoted if the material is fed in a dilute form. Experiments in the laboratory confirmed this effect visually. In {{order to be able}} to compare numerically the extend of ACS, a segregation index has been developed. It was found that a dilute particle jet leads to more ACS than dense particle jet. The effects of solids feeding rate and <b>air</b> <b>extraction</b> rate on ACS have been investigated in the laboratory silo and the results clearly show that low solids feeding rates promote ACS. It was further found that an increase in the <b>air</b> <b>extraction</b> rate has a mild effect in suppressing ACS. These effects were confirmed by the Fluent simulations, which showed an unexpectedly good agreement with the experiments...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{production}} of aluminium is a well- established process, quality fluctuations frequently occur because of its main feedstock, alumina. One {{of the reasons for}} the problems is the segregation of particles during the storage of alumina in silos. Air current segregation (ACS) was identified as one mechanism causing segregation. During the filling of a storage silo with alumina powder, air is simultaneously entrained. As a result, airflow circulation arises and separates fine particles from th. e bulk stream, which are then deposited to the outer areas of the silo. The literature claims that factors such as powder feeding height and rate, and <b>air</b> <b>extraction</b> heavily influence the occurrence of this phenomenon in the silo. However, in the literature, no quantitative experimental data are presented. Due to the lack of a detailed physical understanding of ACS, it was the objective of this research to investigate the relationship between different parameters, e. g. the powder feeding rate and <b>air</b> <b>extraction</b> rate, and ACS. A further objective of this research was to find a scaling method that could be used to scale results between different sized experiments. First, all significant parameters were identified by experiments and dimensional analysis was applied to develop a scaling rule. Five dimensionless groups were obtained, which was unwieldy. To reduce the number of dimensionless groups, physical properties were lumped into the terminal velocity. This simplified approach gave three dimensionless groups. These were tested in an air silo and a cylindrical silo filled with water. The results showed that the dynamics of the particle-air flows in the water and air silo were slightly different. Further, experiments included the visualisation of the particle jet in an industrial storage unit, a two dimensional rack, and in laboratory cylindrical silos. To measure the particle velocities in a laboratory cylindrical silo, Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) were used and results showed that a dense particle jet leads to minute segregation. In addition, process parameters, e. g. the powder feeding rate and <b>air</b> <b>extraction</b> rate, were varied in cylindrical silos and the extent of ACS measured.

50|$|The most {{significant}} {{cause for the}} continuing delays has been the fire protection and alarm system. In the terminal building, the system was not built according to the construction permit, and failed the mandatory acceptance test necessary to open the airport. FBB proposed an interim solution employing up to 700 human fire spotters which the building supervision department of the local Dahme-Spreewald district rejected. Inspectors have uncovered flaws in the wiring, programming {{and implementation of the}} highly complex system designed by Siemens and Bosch which automatically controls sprinklers, smoke extractors and fire doors. For aesthetic reasons, designers decided that the terminal would have smoke <b>extraction</b> <b>ducts</b> in its ceiling, but they would not exhaust on its rooftop. In a fire, smoke would be pumped from the ceiling into a shaft running down and through the basement below the structure, requiring the natural rising behavior of hot air in the shaft to be reversed. Achieving this on the scale necessary for this airport is a unique undertaking and, thus far, this elaborate smoke extraction system has not worked as planned. To meet the acceptance test requirements, large scale reconstruction work of the fire system might be needed.|$|R

At present, the application of jet fans is the standard solution, but not necessarily the optimum for all applications.
