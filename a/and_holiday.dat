5|$|After the Exposition, {{the park}} {{continued}} to be extremely popular and was a magnet for growth in the area. State fairs <b>and</b> <b>holiday</b> celebrations were held at the park. Street car lines to the park increased. It was a generally prosperous time.|$|E
5|$|A {{hospital}} {{opened in}} Owaka in 1924, offering a decreasing {{range of services}} until its closure during the 1980s. The building and grounds now host a youth hostel <b>and</b> <b>holiday</b> park. Today, Owaka is served by a medical centre and a pharmacy. The Southern District Health Board is responsible for most publicly funded health services in Otago and Southland, including the Catlins.|$|E
5|$|Fishing is {{the primary}} source of income, {{although}} coconut palm, buxa coloring, cashew nuts and fruits are produced for trade. Because of its reef and extensive beaches, the snorkeling industry is gaining in popularity in Msambweni, <b>and</b> <b>holiday</b> cottages and hotels have sprung up in the area, such as the Msambweni Beach House. The town is noted for its leprosarium and contains the Msambweni District Hospital. The Koromojo Dam is immediately north of the town.|$|E

5|$|In 1966, a five-gondola {{train set}} with green-and-white-striped awnings and a five-gondola train set with blue-and-white-striped awnings, {{referred}} to by Disneyland employees as Holiday Green <b>and</b> <b>Holiday</b> Blue respectively, {{were added to the}} DRR's rolling stock. Both train sets had side-facing bench seating like the Holiday Red freight train. By the time that the new Holiday Green <b>and</b> <b>Holiday</b> Blue trains sets were introduced in 1966, the DRR's original roundhouse, located {{on the end of a}} spur line connected to the main line near the Rivers of America in the Frontierland section, had been replaced by a larger roundhouse, located on the end of a new spur line connected to the main line in the Tomorrowland section. The new roundhouse, where the DRR's locomotives and train cars are stored and maintained, was also built to house the storage and maintenance facility for the Disneyland Monorail.|$|E

5|$|The {{fishing port}} <b>and</b> <b>holiday</b> resort of Cromer in the English county of Norfolk {{has had a}} rail service since 1877. It was served by three railway {{stations}} for many years, and is now served by two. Cromer Beach station, which opened in 1887, was renamed Cromer following {{the closure of the}} other early stations.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1967, Como began {{reducing}} his TV appearances, gradually becoming {{limited to}} seasonal <b>and</b> <b>holiday</b> specials {{with the emphasis}} being on Christmas. Como had numerous Christmas television specials, beginning on Christmas Eve 1948, and continuing to 1994, when his final Christmas special was recorded in Ireland. They were recorded in many countries, including the Holy Land, Mexico, and Canada, {{as well as many}} locations throughout the United States. The 1987 Christmas special was cancelled at the behest of an angry Como; The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) was willing to offer him only a Saturday 10 PM time slot for it three weeks before the holiday. Perry filled the yearly gap for his fans with live Christmas concerts in various locations.|$|E
5|$|Community Transit began {{restoring}} cut {{service in}} September 2014, adding 13 {{percent of its}} former bus hours primarily to improve midday service. In June 2015, CT restored its Sunday <b>and</b> <b>holiday</b> service {{as part of a}} 27,000-hour expansion, representing 20 percent of the 2010 reduction, funded by recovering sales tax revenue and a 25-cent increase in fares the following month. The agency was given approval from the state legislature in July 2015 to increase sales taxes by an additional 0.3%, dependent on voter approval via a ballot measure during the November 2015 election that was eventually won, to fund a new Swift line as well as local service expansion.|$|E

5|$|Increased {{service was}} {{provided}} during the 1960 spring meeting with Saturday <b>and</b> <b>holiday</b> service. During its first year, the service carried 341,000 riders. During the 1960s the extra fare was collected at special turnstiles {{at the three}} stations served by the special. Larger tokens were used. On July 5, 1966, the fare on the Aqueduct Special was raised to 75 cents. The fare was raised to $1 on January 4, 1970. The fare was raised from a $1 to $1.50 in February 1972. Later on the fare was lowered back to $1. The fare was raised back to $1.50 on June 28, 1980.|$|E
5|$|Several of the area's coastal {{settlements}} have {{facilities for}} small boats, but generally only fishing <b>and</b> <b>holiday</b> craft use them; no regular passenger or freight-boat service {{runs to the}} Catlins. A railway line, the Catlins River Branch, linked the area with the South Island Main Trunk Line from the late 19th century. Construction of this line began in 1879, {{but it did not}} reach Owaka until 1896. Construction progressed slowly due to the difficult terrain, and the final terminus of the line at Tahakopa was not completed until 1915.|$|E
5|$|The Briarcliff Manor Community Bonfire is {{a winter}} holiday event at Law Park, {{hosted by the}} village and the Briarcliff Friends of the Arts, {{involving}} live music (primarily seasonal <b>and</b> <b>holiday</b> songs), refreshments, and craft projects for children. Another annual community event is the Memorial Day parade, a tradition in Briarcliff Manor for more than fifty years. Before the parade begins, the Municipal Building's bell is rung to commemorate firefighters who {{have died in the}} previous year; the parade ends at the village's war memorial in Law Park, where wreaths are laid on the monument. The holiday has been celebrated in the village since the early 1900s, though initially involving large family picnics, with parades reserved for the Fourth of July.|$|E

5|$|The Cleveland Indians {{previously}} played {{home games}} at Cleveland Stadium, which they {{shared with the}} Cleveland Browns of the National Football League. The Indians first played at the stadium, which seated nearly 80,000 people for baseball, for the 1932 and 1933 seasons, but returned to smaller League Park for most games in 1934. From 1936 to 1946, they played weekend <b>and</b> <b>holiday</b> games at Cleveland Stadium, and eventually night games and other dates where larger crowds were expected, moving to the stadium full-time in 1947. Cleveland Stadium was the largest stadium in the American League during its tenure as a baseball facility and was the largest stadium in Major League Baseball for {{all but a few}} seasons.|$|E
5|$|The album {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics, who complimented its relaxed yet lively and contemporary feel, while others {{felt it was}} predictable and too overproduced in places. It debuted at number four on the United States Billboard 200 album chart, and reached number one on both the Top R/Hip-Hop Albums <b>and</b> <b>Holiday</b> Albums chart. It was later certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments exceeding 500,000 copies. Elsewhere, however, the album failed to make an impact, reaching the top thirty in Australia and Hungary, and the top fifty in Austria and Italy. It missed out on the top one-hundred in the United Kingdom by one position, peaking at one-hundred {{and one on the}} albums chart.|$|E
5|$|The {{coming of}} the Yorkshire Dales Railway to Threshfield in 1902 opened up Hebden as a {{destination}} for day visitors <b>and</b> <b>holiday</b> makers. A purpose-built timber guest house was opened in 1909 {{at the south end}} of the village by the Co-operative Holiday Association, founded by Thomas Arthur Leonard. It passed into private hands in 1960, and continued as a holiday centre until 1990, mainly catering for school parties. It was demolished in 2016 and replaced with a private residence.|$|E

5|$|There is a shop/post office {{located in}} Inverarish. Accommodation is {{available}} in the old manor of Raasay House, and at various B. There are significant numbers of incomers <b>and</b> <b>holiday</b> homes especially in the south of the island. This has helped to arrest the population decline from over 900 in 1803 to 194 in 2001. Some inhabitants belong to the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland, which strictly observes the Sabbath. On Sundays there are no public services, the playground is closed and, until 2004, the ferry did not run.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{development}} continued, {{including the}} growth of Old Town up the hillside (Green Street Farm Estate) and the housing estates of Hampden Park, Willingdon Trees and Langney. During {{the latter half of}} the 20th century, there were controversies over the demolition of Pococks, a 15th-century manor house on what is now the Rodmill Housing Estate, and the granting of planning permission for a 19-storey block at the western end of the seafront. The latter project (South Cliff Tower) was realised in 1965 despite a storm of protest led by the newly formed Eastbourne and District Preservation Committee, which later became Eastbourne Civic Society, and was renamed the Eastbourne Society in 1999. Local conservationists also failed to prevent the construction of the glass-plated TGWU conference <b>and</b> <b>holiday</b> centre, but were successful in purchasing Polegate Windmill, thus saving it from demolition and redevelopment. Most of the expansion took place on the northern and eastern margins of the town, gradually swallowing surrounding villages. However, the richer western part was constrained by the Downs and has remained largely unchanged. In 1981, a large section of the town centre was replaced by the indoor shops of the Arndale Centre.|$|E
5|$|Copano Bay is a northwestern {{extension}} of Aransas Bay, west of Rockport, Texas in Refugio and Aransas counties. It is supplied with seawater from the Gulf of Mexico via Aransas Bay, and fed freshwater from the Aransas River, Mission River and Copano Creek. As an estuary, the bay {{is home to}} a diverse ecosystem consisting of various birds including the endangered whooping crane, and numerous finfish including the redfish as well as shellfish such as oysters. It is classified as a nursery for shrimp, which prohibits production from the bay. Copano Bay is also a historic location for human usage and settlement that dates back to the 18th century, beginning with the historic port of El Copano and the 19th century settlements of St. Mary's of Aransas and Copano. The present-day towns of Bayside, Copano Village <b>and</b> <b>Holiday</b> Beach were all founded in the 20th century. Oil and natural gas are pumped from below the bay's surface, and contribute to the livelihood of the local economies. Recently, areas around the bay were affected by Hurricane Harvey which crossed over the bay as a Category 3 hurricane.|$|E

50|$|Chabad customs <b>and</b> <b>holidays</b> are the practices, rituals <b>and</b> <b>holidays</b> {{performed}} <b>and</b> {{celebrated by}} adherents of the Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic movement.
