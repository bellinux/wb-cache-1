5|$|After earning enough money, Kertész quickly {{bought his}} first camera (an ICA box camera) in 1912, despite his family's protests to {{continue}} his career in business. In his free time, he photographed the local peasants, gypsies, and landscape of the surrounding Hungarian Plains (the puszta). His first photograph {{is believed to be}} Sleeping Boy, Budapest, 1912. His photographs were first published in 1917 in the magazine Érdekes Újság, during World War I, while Kertész was serving in the Austro-Hungarian army. As early as 1914 (for example, Eugene, 1914), his distinctive <b>and</b> <b>mature</b> style was already evident.|$|E

40|$|Consumer {{trust in}} the food {{industry}} is heavily reliant upon accurate labelling of meat products. As such, methods which can verify whether meat is correctly labelled are of great value to producers, retailers, and consumers. This paper illustrates two approaches to classify between, fresh and frozen thawed, and in a novel manner <b>matured</b> <b>and</b> <b>matured</b> frozen-thawed, as well as fresh <b>and</b> <b>matured</b> beef using the 500 - 1010 nm waveband, captured using hyperspectral imaging, and CIELAB measurements. The results show successful classification based upon CIELAB between 1) fresh and frozen-thawed (CCR = 0. 93), and 2) fresh <b>and</b> <b>matured</b> (CCR = 0. 92). With successful classification between <b>matured</b> <b>and</b> <b>matured</b> frozen-thawed beef using the entire spectral range (CCR = 1. 00). The performance of reduced spectral models is also investigated. Overall {{it was found that}} CIELAB co-ordinates can be used for successful classification for all comparisons except between <b>matured</b> <b>and</b> <b>matured</b> frozen-thawed.

5|$|Bioluminescent {{tissue in}} the mature fruit body is {{restricted}} {{to the edge of}} the gills (as well as the cross-veins that connect them), the junction of the gills with the stem, and the inrolled cap edge. Distribution of bioluminescence along the gill edge corresponds to the position of the cheilocystidia. Less than 10% of the light emitted from both the young <b>and</b> <b>mature</b> fruit bodies is from other tissues, including the fertile hymenial area and the stem. Fruit body luminescence is highly variable between fruit bodies found on different logs in different environments.|$|E

5|$|The ideal {{habitat for}} these rabbits {{is in an}} area between mature and young forests.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} verify the effects of {{cryoprotectant}} and Open Pulled Straw (OPS) vitrification on ultrastructural changes in bovine oocytes. In experiment 1, the cryoprotectant exposure was analyzed by distributing immature <b>and</b> <b>matured</b> cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) in groups: control immature, immature and exposed to one vitrification solution (IVS 1), immatured and exposed to two vitrification solutions (IVS 1 - 2), <b>matured</b> <b>and</b> exposed to one vitrification solution (MVS 1), <b>matured</b> <b>and</b> exposed to two vitrification solutions (MVS 1 - 2), control matured, IVS 1 post in vitro maturation (IVS 1 post IVM) and IVS 1 - 2 post in vitro maturation (IVS 1 - 2 post IVM). In experiment 2, immature <b>and</b> <b>matured</b> COCs were distributed in: control and vitrified by OPS using VS 1 - 2. Sample COCs from both experiments were evaluated for mitochondrial distribution, nuclear lamins (immature COCs) <b>and</b> meiotic spindle (<b>matured</b> COCs). In both experiments, COCs were in vitro <b>matured</b> <b>and</b> fertilized. In experiment I, nuclear lamins in immature COCs exhibited higher proportion of structures with irregular shape when treated with VS 1 and VS 1 - 2. Immature <b>and</b> <b>matured</b> COCs treated with VS 1 - 2, <b>and</b> <b>matured</b> COCs treated with VS 1 had lower (P 0. 05). The cleavage rate was higher (P < 0. 05) in matured vitrified than immature vitrified group (19 % vs. 8 %). In conclusion, immature COCs were more tolerant to cryoprotectant exposure. However, matured oocytes showed better embryo development (cleavage) after vitrification...|$|R

5|$|Both the mycelia and {{the fruit}} bodies of M.haematopus (both young <b>and</b> <b>mature</b> specimens) are {{reported}} to be bioluminescent. However, the luminescence is quite weak, and not visible to the dark-adapted eye; in one study, light emission was detectable only after 20hours of exposure to X-ray film. Although the biochemical basis of bioluminescence in M.haematopus has not been scientifically investigated, in general, bioluminescence {{is caused by the}} action of luciferases, enzymes that produce light by the oxidation of a luciferin (a pigment). The biological purpose of bioluminescence in fungi is not definitively known, although several hypotheses have been suggested: it may help attract insects to help with spore dispersal, it may be a by-product of other biochemical functions, or it may help deter heterotrophs that might consume the fungus.|$|E

As a juvenile, Eolambia would have been preyed upon by large crocodylomorphs residing in the lake waters.

5|$|Juniperus communis berries {{vary from}} four to twelvemillimeters in diameter; other species are mostly similar in size, though some are larger, notably J. drupacea (20–28mm).

The berries are green when young, <b>and</b> <b>mature</b> to a purple-black colour over about 18 months in most species, including J. communis (shorter, 8–10 months in a few species, and about 24 months in J. drupacea).

5|$|The brain-like surface folds <b>and</b> <b>mature</b> olive-brown gleba are {{characteristic}} of Calvatia craniiformis, but younger puffballs {{that have not yet}} developed these characteristics may be difficult to identify to species. Another edible puffball, C.cyathiformis (lilac puffball) grows to similar dimensions but has gleba that is purple-brown when mature. Calvatia fragilis is smaller and pink or purple mature gleba. C.bicolor is a smaller, rounder puffball that could be confused with younger specimens of C.craniiformis, but the former species has more coarsely ornamented spores, and lacks a distinct subgleba. Handkea utriformis is roughly similar in appearance to C.craniiformis, but unlike the latter it develops a cavernous opening to reveal an olive-brown gleba, and has distinct slits in its capillitial threads.|$|E
