5|$|Canada's Wonderland's first {{interactive}} dark {{ride was}} Scooby-Doo's Haunted Mansion (renamed Boo Blasters on Boo Hill after Cedar Fair's {{purchase of the}} park), which opened in 2000. It was designed by Sally Corporation and relies entirely on physical sets and theming rather than projected animations, and uses basic, moving props. About four years later, park management began discussing {{the addition of a}} new attraction inside Wonder Mountain. The technology available at the time meant the cost of building a more advanced dark ride was too expensive for a regional amusement park. In 2011, as technology improved and the costs decreased, the park started planning a second interactive dark ride. Several companies were contacted to design the <b>audio-visual</b> portion of the future ride; park management chose Triotech to do so.|$|E

40|$|The {{positive}} effects of using different types of listening texts (i. e. audio, video) in listening enhancement {{as a part of}} foreign language learning are already well known (Turel 2004 : 178 - 84, Tschirner 2001 : 310, Ridgway 2000 : 182, Borchardt 1999 : 10, Adair-Hauck et al. 1999 : 273, 289, Peter 1994 : 202, Hart 1992 : 5). As multimedia enables us to combine and present different listening texts on the same digital computer platform more effectively, the same listening texts can be presented to language learners in different forms (Turel 2004 : 129 - 38, Trinder 2002 : 79, Heron et al. 2002 : 37, Brett 1998 : 81, Chanier 1996 : 7, Ashward 1996 : 80, Brett 1996 : 204, Fox et al. 1992 : 39, Leffa 1992 : 66). In this research, the language learners were provided with listening texts in the form of audio-only and <b>audio-visuals</b> (i. e. audio + visuals, audio + animation, video-only, video + visuals). They were also provided with the opportunity of re-listening to the same audio-only with visuals and <b>audio-visuals</b> without visuals. This study investigated 45 autonomous intermediate and upper intermediate language learners' perceptions of the opportunity of re-listening to the same audio-only with visuals and <b>audio-visuals</b> without visuals through interactive multimedia listening software that aimed to enhance the listening skills of the participants. The results reveal that the language learners are in favour of re-listening to the same audio-only with visuals and <b>audio-visuals</b> without visuals. They believe that such an opportunity improves their listening skills and helps prepare them for the real world...|$|R
