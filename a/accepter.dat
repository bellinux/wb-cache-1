60|$|Looking over my scraps, I find I {{wrote the}} {{following}} during 1864. The happening to our America, abroad {{as well as}} at home, these years, is indeed most strange. The democratic republic has paid her today the terrible and resplendent compliment of the united wish of all {{the nations of the world}} that her union should be broken, her future cut off, and that she should be compell'd to descend to the level of kingdoms and empires ordinarily great. There is certainly not one government in Europe but is now watching the war in this country, with the ardent prayer that the United States may be effectually split, crippled, and dismember'd by it. There is not one but would help toward that dismemberment, if it dared. I say such is the ardent wish to-day of England and of France, as governments, and of all the nations of Europe, as governments. I think indeed it is to-day the real, heartfelt wish of all the nations of the world, with the single exception of Mexico--Mexico, the only one to whom we have ever really done wrong, and now the only one who prays for us and for our triumph, with genuine prayer. Is it not indeed strange? America, made up of all, cheerfully from the beginning opening her arms to all, the result and justifier of all, of Britain, Germany, France and Spain--all here--the <b>accepter,</b> the friend, hope, last resource and general house of all--she who has harm'd none, but been bounteous to so many, to millions, the mother of strangers and exiles, all nations--should now, I say, be paid this dread compliment of general governmental fear and hatred. Are we indignant? alarm'd? Do we feel jeopardized? No; help'd, braced, concentrated, rather. We are all too prone to wander from ourselves, to affect Europe, and watch her frowns and smiles. We need this hot lesson of general hatred, and henceforth must never forget it. Never again will we trust the moral sense nor abstract friendliness of a single government of the old world.|$|E

The system was tested by measuring known multi-exponential transients generated by RC circuits and applied {{to the study of}} non-exponential transients resulting from electron emission from Sn-related DX centers and hole emission from Fe-related deep <b>accepters.</b> The non-exponential transients were investigated under different conditions and related to the alloy random effect. Their LDS spectra exhibited several well-resolved sharp peaks that were assigned to the fine structures of the two DX centers and the Fe-related deep <b>accepters,</b> respectively, after comparison with DLTS observations. The activation energies of the fine structures were determined by linear fitting of the slopes of temperature dependences of electron and hole emission rates. The results show that the LDS is useful for investigation of deep-level fine structures. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|An {{important}} factor in the antiperiplanar conformer is the interaction between molecular orbitals. Anti-periplanar geometry will put a bonding orbital and an anti-bonding orbital approximately parallel to each other, or syn-periplanar. Figure 6 is another representation of 2-chloro-2,3-dimethylbutane (Figure 5), showing the C-H bonding orbital, σC-H, and the C-Cl anti-bonding orbital, σ*C-Cl, syn-periplanar. The parallel orbitals can overlap and become involved in hyperconjugation. If the bonding orbital is an electron donor and the anti-bonding orbital is an electron <b>accepter,</b> then the bonding orbital will be able to donate electronegativity into the anti-bonding orbital. This filled-to-unfilled donor-acceptor interaction has an overall stabilizing effect on the molecule. However, donation from a bonding orbital into an anti-bonding orbital will also result in the weakening of both of those bonds. In Figure 6, 2-chloro-2,3-dimethylbutane is stabilized through hyperconjugation from electron donation from σC-H into σ*C-Cl, but both the C-H and the C-Cl bond are weakened. A molecular orbital diagram shows that the mixing of σC-H and σ*C-Cl in 2-chloro-2,3-dimethylbutane lowers the energy of both the orbitals (Figure 7).|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} traps and shallow <b>accepters</b> on the continuous-wave {{steady-state}} photoluminescence of GaAs-(Ga,Al) As quantum-well wires are studied at room temperature. The analysis {{is based on}} a quantum-mechanical calculation of the transition rates of radiative recombinations of excited-conduction electrons with free and bound (at <b>accepters)</b> holes, and on a phenomenological treatment of the nonradiative rates associated with transitions involving conduction electrons falling into traps, and trapped electrons recombining with free holes. The various steady-state radiative and nonradiative e-h recombination lifetimes as function of the cw laser intensity are then obtained, as well as the dependence of the conduction-electron quasi-Fermi level (or chemical potential), and carrier densities on the laser intensity. We have also studied the laser-intensity dependence of various recombination efficiencies and of the integrated photoluminescence intensity. Finally, trap and impurity effects are shown to be quite important in a quantitative understanding of the room temperature steady-state photoluminescence of quantum-well wires.

40|$|The {{interest}} of rare earth doping of semiconductors {{has increased in}} the last years due to its possible applications in optical devices requiring temperature stability. Advantages of these systems are the presence of a sharp temperature independent rare-earth luminescence and the possibility of activation of the emitting rare-earth centers by minority carrier injection. In this work the effect of erbium doping on the luminescence and on the native <b>accepters</b> of GaSb crystals has been investigated by CL-SEM. Er doping has been found to increase the total CL intensity and to produce spectral changes that depend on the erbium concentration. At moderate doping the native acceptor concentration, as detected by the luminescence band A, decreases. At high Er concentrations Er-Sb precipitates form and doping appears not to be efficient in the suppression of <b>accepters.</b> X-ray microanalysis reveals that the composition of the precipitates is Er- 5 Sb- 3.
