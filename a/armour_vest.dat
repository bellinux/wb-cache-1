50|$|PCSOs use {{a police}} radio to {{communicate}} with other PCSOs, police officers and the control room on the same channel. Some neighbourhood police teams NPT or safer neighbourhood teams (SNT) also monitor local shop/pub watch radios. A body <b>armour</b> <b>vest</b> is issued to all PCSOs although in previous years some forces did not do this. Arrangements for use vary between forces, from compulsory use throughout shift down to officers choice of use. Unlike constables, due to the non-confrontational nature of their role PCSOs are not normally issued with batons, incapacitant spray, handcuffs or leg restraints. However PCSOs are authorised to carry and use this equipment. Three forces are an exception to this convention. British Transport Police PCSOs are issued with handcuffs and leg restraints; Also Dyfed-Powys Police and North Wales Police PCSOs are issued with handcuffs.|$|E

40|$|Seams and {{stitching}} in a {{body armour}} could affect their protective and comfort performance. The seamless technology is a method used to eliminate cutting and sewing processes in making knitted garments. This method is adopted to avoid the traditional cut and sew method used to accommodate the bust contour for female body armour design. The 3 D knitting technology Shima Seiki SES-S. WG® and its whole garment WG-SDS-ONE APEX 3 program were used to develop a seamless female body armour for fit and comfort. The Kevlar-wool and 100 % Kevlar fabrics were produced as weft-knit single jersey using the whole garment knitting machine. The physical properties of the fabrics produced were measured. These properties were used to design two different styles of 3 D seamless female body <b>armour</b> <b>vests,</b> the loose-vest and bra-vest. The knitted fabrics and the 3 D seamless female body <b>armour</b> <b>vests</b> were engineered to confirm the design...|$|R
50|$|Body <b>armour</b> <b>vests</b> {{are issued}} to PCSOs—although {{originally}} not all forces did this—and wearing one is usually compulsory. Staffordshire Police {{was the last}} police force to issue Stab vests to PCSOs; they were only issued to officers of this force in April 2011.

40|$|Title: The {{influence}} of ballistic vests for coordinating {{ability of the}} Czech Republic`s policemen. Aims: The aim of this thesis is to compare different types of protective ballistic vest with {{the same degree of}} ballistic protection within their influence on the coordination abilities of probands and the following comparisons and evaluation of results. Methods: This is an empirical thesis of observational character. The standardized motoric test for coordination skills was performed and its results were statistically processed. These data were then compared using the t-test. The comfort during using vest was also evaluated by interviewing. Results: From the measured data, {{it was found that the}} difference between two of the three tested vests was not statistically significant (Petris and Eagle). Their results were relatively balanced. Highly significant statistical difference was between these two vests and the third test vest (Global Armour). The Global <b>Armour</b> <b>vest</b> came out of the test the worst. This fact is also confirmed by the result of questioning when all ten probands evaluated better the vest Petris and nine probands evaluated better the vest Eagle, than Global <b>Armour</b> <b>vest</b> due to the comfort.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of preliminary research designed to explore in depth the design, fit and comfort of selected sports bras for large breasted women worn under soft body armour. Female armed personnel need to feel safe and protected in soft armour vests, giving them physiological comfort to perform their duties daily. Troublesome physical and additional physiological problems in relation to the female body are frequently caused due to the poor design of various bra components. Different breast sizes require unique bras designs. Specifically, when it comes to plus-size breasts, all the difficulties of fitting are more evident. In general, retail bra designs are not overcoming the above-mentioned bra&# 039;s wear problems even before consideration of how they relate to be worn under the soft body armour. As breast size and shape vary greatly between individuals, the design of bra size and style are important. In addition, fit and comfort are the most important factors of concern to the customers. With an aim to achieve a perfect bra shape, fit and comfort, designers have a strong drive to develop a superior quality bra by properly using components and materials with high performance. Five commercial sports bras were selected based on their suitability for wear under body armour. The bras were fitted on a fit model and ranked in terms of the design criteria (1) non-wire, firmness and comfort, (2) fit and size range (D to G-cup) shape, (3) moisture wicking, and (4) composition and textile quality. They were then assessed for correct fit by an expert bra fitter and photographed to assess frontal and side-shape protrusion for mobility and for comfort on the side upper arm. Comparisons indicated differences in the side arm protrusion for some popular brands. Further wear test under a simulation mock-up body <b>armour</b> <b>vest</b> was conducted for observing comfort and moisture management performance over a period of 6 hours. The bra comfort performance was compared...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} reports {{the design and}} engineering of Kevlar-based stab resistant body armour fabrics and female vests, and evaluates their performance for protection and comfort especially for female police officers. Kevlar-wool woven fabric has been employed as a potential material for body armour vests. This current study investigates the thermal comfort properties of woven Kevlar-wool ballistic fabrics and commercial woven 100 % Kevlar ballistic fabrics. The effects of fabric physical properties on laboratory-measured thermal comfort were analysed. In this context, their thermal comfort performance was compared, and fabric friction and surface roughness were evaluated. A water repellent treatment {{was applied to the}} woven Kevlar-wool fabric to ensure comparable thermal comfort results with the commercial 100 % Kevlar. Since the commercial Kevlar fabric showed a water repellent result in the moisture management test, the effects of the water repellent treatment on the Kevlar-wool fabric were examined as well. This study also presents the fabric bursting strength and tear strength for comparison. Experimental results show a clear difference in thermal comfort properties: the Kevlar-wool fabric possesses better moisture management properties and mechanical properties than the Kevlar fabric. Seams and stitching in body armour could affect their protective and comfort performance. Seamless technology is a method used to minimise cutting and sewing processes in making knitted garments. Seamless technology was adopted to accommodate the bust contour for female body armour designs. The 3 D-knitting technology Shima Seiki SES&ndash;S. WG&reg; and its whole-garment program were used to develop seamless female body armour vests for fit and comfort. The Kevlar-wool and 100 % Kevlar fabrics were produced as weft-knit single jersey using the whole-garment knitting machine and their physical properties were measured. These properties were used to design and engineer two different styles of 3 D seamless female body <b>armour</b> <b>vest,</b> the loose-vest and the bra-vest. The knitted 100 % Kevlar fabric was coated with abrasive particles to enhance stab protection performance. The stab-resistance of personal body armour standard (NIJ 0115. 00) was used to determine the protection level. Single&ndash; and double-blade knives were used in this stab test. The knitted fabric mechanical properties were also investigated using bursting strength tests and stab resistance drop tests with a range of impactors. The results show that one layer of knitted Kevlar-wool, plus eight layers of knitted 100 % Kevlar, and one coated layer with abrasive sand particles (a total of ten layers), passed the tests with less than 7 mm perforation at 8 J using a single-blade knife. Moreover, a combination of the knitted fabrics (Kevlar-wool, 100 % Kevlar and coated Kevlar) could improve their stab-resistance. Multi-layered flexible stab-resistant vests were assembled and evaluated for comfort using a thermal manikin and sweating guarded hot-plate. The moisture management properties of the knitted fabrics were investigated. The results of this research provide a good reference for designing and engineering female body armour capable of resisting stab penetration, as well as possessing improved comfort performance...|$|E
5|$|Stealth is a {{significant}} element of the gameplay; frequent gunfire can alert distant guards, and activated alarms can trigger infinitely-respawning enemies. Therefore, to avoid gunfights with numerous opponents, it is advantageous to eliminate soldiers and security cameras before they spot or hear the player.

40|$|Title: The {{influence}} of body armour on a direct front kick strength Aim: The {{aim of the}} thesis was both to find out and compare {{the strength of a}} direct front kick made either with a ballistic vest or without it. Furthermore, the thesis focused on the strengths of a direct front kick made with a load-bearing vest compared to a ballistic vest. The methods used: The thesis can be characterised as an empiric work based on observation. The kick strength was measured by a dynamometer and the results have been statistically evaluated by a paired t-test. Results: The first part of the thesis, which was dealing with a direct front kick made with a ballistic vest or without it, resulted in {{the fact that there is}} a positive effect of using that kind of a vest. The kick strength was definitely more intensive using the ballistic vest. However, this can be claimed only in such ideal conditions which were available during the measurements. The probands were also not influenced by any physical strain, which is quite typical of martial activities. The second part focused on the differences using a ballistic or a training load-bearing vest when performing a direct front kick.
