40|$|The {{average size}} of hot-work tools has {{gradually}} {{increased over the}} past years. This affects the effective temperature cycle tools experience during hardening,as large dimensions prevent uniform and rapid cooling, and thereby the resulting microstructures and properties. In {{order to avoid the}} formation of coarse structures or cracking during heat treatment it has become common practise to lower the <b>austenitising</b> temperature below that recommended by the steel manufacturer. In this work, therefore, the effects of <b>austenitising</b> at temperatures lower thancommonly recommended are investigated. Three 5 % Cr hot-work tool steelsalloyed with Mo and V were heat treated, resulting microstructures andtempering carbides were studied and transformation characteristics determined for different <b>austenitising</b> temperatures and different cooling rates. The temperatures and cooling rates have been chosen to be representative for heat treatments of different sizes of tools. Bainite rather than martensite formed during slow cooling regardless of <b>austenitising</b> temperature. A lowered <b>austenitising</b> temperature produced largeramounts of both bainite and retained austenite while a higher caused graingrowth. Carbon partitioning during the bainitic transformation resulted in anincrease of the carbon content in the retained austenite of at least 0. 3 wt. %. The <b>austenitising</b> temperature influences also the type and amount of tempering carbides that precipitate, which affects the properties of the steel. Higher <b>austenitising</b> temperatures favour the precipitation of MC carbides during tempering. The Mo rich M 2 C type carbides were proven to be more prone to coarsening during service at 560 °C- 600 °C, while V rich MC carbides preserve their fine distribution. A best practice heat treatment needs to balance the increase of grain size with increasing <b>austenitising</b> temperatures, with the possibility to form more tempering carbides. Higher <b>austenitising</b> temperatures also give less retained austenite, which can affect dimensional stability and toughness negatively after temperin...|$|E

An ADI microstructure <b>austenitised</b> at 900 °C and austempered at 390 °C has been investigated in detail. Crack initiation and growth behaviour was assessed under three-point bend testing conditions. Primary initiation events occurred exclusively at pores with further micro-crack initiation occurring at decohered graphite nodules in the monotonic plastic zone ahead of the advancing dominant macro-crack tip. Lifetime was however determined by propagation behaviour rather than coalescence events. The changes in the as-cast microstructure generated by this heat treatment have resulted in improved fatigue crack propagation performance due to the reduction in eutectic carbides and the relatively high quantity of retained austenite compared with previous studies, giving rise to greater crack path tortuousity and shielding...|$|R

The number of carbides cracking on loading to stresses greater than 275 MPa is critical in determining the failure mechanism. In general, high carbide area fractions promote coalescence dominated fatigue crack failure whilst low area fractions promote propagation dominated fatigue crack failure. Individual carbides have been characterised using finite body tessellation (FBT) and adaptive numerical modelling (SUpport vector Parsimonious ANalysis Of VAriance (SUPANOVA)) techniques in an attempt to quantify the factors promoting carbide fracture.

For example, {{as well as}} the normal nitrogen peak, other broader loss peaks were observed centred on 100 C in the case of air-cooled samples <b>austenitised</b> at 900 C for 1 h.

40|$|ABSTRACT: High-chromium {{white cast}} iron {{contains}} chromium carbides that provide excellent wear resistance, but also cause poor fracture properties. Heat treatments are applied {{in an attempt to}} decrease the angularity of the eutectic carbides and to improve the toughness of the matrix by intentionally creating a high fraction of retained austenite, while minimizing the formation of secondary carbides. It is found that the <b>austenitising</b> temperature hardly affects the carbide morphology. However a large effect is found on the shape and size of the secondary carbides formed and on the relative fractions of austenite and martensite. Measurements are performed with an instrumented drop-weight impact tower on Charpy-like specimens containing electric-discharge-machined notches. Results show that <b>austenitising</b> at high temperature (1100 °C) leads to a significantly larger total fracture energy compared to the as-cast condition. However, the energy absorbed at crack initiation and the KIc value seem not to be affected. SEM observations of the fracture surfaces clearly indicate that the crack propagates along the interfaces of or through the eutectic carbides.

Morphological aspects of delta-ferrite phase and its response to age-hardening were studied by optical, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, electron probe microanalysis and microhardness testing.

The as-quenched microstructures were found to range from almost fully martensitic structures to martensite with up to 35 % retained austenite after quenching, with varying amounts of carbide precipitates. The influence of tempering, double tempering, and sub-zero treatment was investigated. Optical and scanning electron microscopy was used to characterise the as-quenched microstructures, and X-ray diffraction analysis was employed to identify the carbide present in the as-quenched structures and to quantify the retained austenite contents.

As-quenched hardness values ranged from 700 HV to 270 HV, depending on the amount of retained austenite.

The paper {{presents}} {{the influence of}} the grain size and a little higher Cr content on the kinetics of austenite phase transformations during continuous cooling of hypo-eutectoid steel. The kinetics of austenite phase transformations during continuous cooling were determined by means of analysis of the dilatometric curves and structure investigations. The influence of the austenite grain size and the higher Cr content was analysed in two hypo-eutectoid steels containing about 0. 4 % C. One of them had, Cr content higher, by about 1 %. In both steels, the austenite grain size was changing insignificantly up to the <b>austenitising</b> temperature of about 950 fl. Above that temperature, the austenite grain size in carbon steel grew much quicker than that in the steel with Cr addition. The austenite grain in the Cr enriched steel was smaller than that in carbon steel and, in spite of that, the duration of cooled austenite transformations were several times longer. This means that the phase transformations are much more strongly influenced by the addition of chromium slowing down carbon diffusion in austenite, than by the austenite grain size. For each phase transformation in the examined steels, the activation energy of the transformation has been determined. The activation energy of all the phase transformations varied slightly with the increase of <b>austenitising</b> temperature.

For comparison a 4 M NaNO 3 environment was also used. The as-received bulk grade X 100 was found to be less susceptible than a Widmanstätten microstructure, or a pearlite/ferrite, or a “spheroidised” structure. Welding has a significant effect on the microstructure and hence resistance to EAC. Tests on the as-received steel gave serrated load-extension curves and the serrations occur at particular combinations of strain rate and temperature. The serrations at 75 oC and strain rate of 2 x 10 - 6 /s were removed by annealing at 600 oC but this increases the susceptibility to secondary cracking at potentials more negative than – 800 mV (sce). The grade X 100 is less susceptible to stress corrosion cracking (SCC) than to hydrogen embrittlement. The role of carbon and manganese solute atoms in microstructural segregation (banding) was investigated. Banding induced directionality in the growth of stress corrosion cracks and caused fracture surface ovality. EDX microanalysis confirmed that the concentration of manganese is higher in the bands of pearlite. Band removal depends on homogenisation of either carbon or manganese which also depends on temperature, time and diffusion rate. Carbon diffusion may be restricted by cooling <b>austenitised</b> steel at a fast rate. Rapid cooling removes carbon segregation but does not remove manganese segregation. Homogenisation of manganese at 1175 oC takes more than five hours. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServicePTDF, NigeriaGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Various steel {{chain links}} {{presented}} cracking during their manufacturing process, which includes induction case hardening and electrogalvanizing steps. Fractographic {{examination of the}} exposed crack surfaces revealed intergranular cracking with some areas featuring {{a thin layer of}} iron oxide, indicating that the cracking took place after the electrogalvanizing step. The location of the cracks coincided with the position of the deepest case hardened layer, suggesting the occurrence of localized overheating during the induction case hardening step. Inductive heating finite element analysis (COSMOS Designstar Software) confirmed that during the case hardening the <b>austenitising</b> temperature reached in the crack region values of approximately 1050 degrees C. The results indicated that intergranular cracking was caused by hydrogen embrittlement. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Tenaris-Confa...|$|E
40|$|The {{austenite}} grain growth behaviour of microalloyed Al–V–N and Al–V–Ti–N steels has been studied. Estimations of {{austenite grain}} size for Al–V–N steels by several different grain growth inhibition models {{demonstrated that the}} best match to experimental results {{can be obtained from}} Gladman and Rios equations and it is AlN that controls the austenite grain size. The experimental and calculated results indicated that the drag force of plate-shaped AlN particles probably depends on their orientation and <b>austenitising</b> temperature. A modified Gladman model, which considers the effects of complex arrays of different types of particles on the stabilized austenite grain size, can be used to predict the austenite grain size and particle size for an Al–V–Ti–N steel when the combined effect of AlN and TiN is considered...|$|E
