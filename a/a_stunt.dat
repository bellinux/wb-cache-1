In September, while filming in Cheruthoni, Faasil sustained a leg injury while performing <b>a</b> <b>stunt</b> with co-star Sujith Shanker.

5|$|A further {{challenge}} for the dog actor was to lie still in an isolation tank and not move even when petted by Bakula or Billingsley during some long scenes whilst on screen. At times <b>a</b> <b>stunt</b> dog was used, but Breezy was required for any close-ups. A prosthetic Beagle was also created for the scenes in the isolation tank and to be submersed in a super-hydration tank. The prop was created by Joel Harlow, who had also created make-up designs for the television series Carnivàle and the film The Chronicles of Riddick.|$|E
5|$|According to Dallas, {{it rained}} on days that were {{supposed}} to be sunny, while other days of production lacked rain when {{they were supposed to be}} rainy. Goodwin added that the scene of Snow and Charming releasing the birds was freezing because of the heavy rain. Their scene in the cabin took place on the first day of the episode's production. Her near-death scene involved a real cliff, though the height was exaggerated later using CGI and a green screen; <b>a</b> <b>stunt</b> double stood in for some of the shots.|$|E
5|$|After {{four weeks}} of filming in Philadelphia, {{the cast and crew}} moved to Wildwood, New Jersey, which doubled for scenes set at the Atlantic City boardwalk. Filming then moved to San Francisco, California. The scene where Birdy and Al climb atop a {{refinery}} building was filmed on the rooftop of an abandoned gasworks in Hercules, California. The scene required Modine and Cage to hang {{off the edge of the}} roof secured by safety wires, while the sequence in which Birdy falls off the roof was performed by <b>a</b> <b>stunt</b> double.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} generals' plot, Đính sent Colonel Nguyễn Hữu Có, {{his deputy}} corps commander, to Mỹ Tho {{to talk to the}} 7th Division commander, Colonel Bùi Đình Đạm, and two regimental commanders, the {{armoured}} unit commander, both subordinate to Đạm, and the chief of Mỹ Tho province. Exhorting them to join the coup, he stated that all the generals were in the plot except the strongly loyalist Huỳnh Văn Cao, and that Đính would soon join. According to one account, Đính had intended that loyalists would report Có's activities to Diệm and Nhu so that it would give him an opportunity to orchestrate <b>a</b> <b>stunt</b> to ingratiate himself with the palace.|$|E
5|$|Lang filmed The Testament of Dr. Mabuse {{at the end}} of 1932 and the {{beginning}} of 1933, desiring to have the film viewed worldwide. In his film, where gun-play, fires, or explosions are needed, Lang often used real weapons. In the opening scene during a power outage, <b>a</b> <b>stunt</b> actor did the gun play. Cinematographer Fritz Arno Wagner stated that he spent most of the production in a state of panic due to the way Lang would endanger his crew. The film is generally filmed in a realistic style with the exception of Mabuse's ghostly appearances throughout the film. Lang admitted later in interviews that if he could re-do the film, he would not have included these supernatural scenes.|$|E
5|$|Mexican actor Pedro Armendáriz was {{recommended}} to Young by director John Ford to play Kerim Bey. After experiencing increasing discomfort {{on location in}} Istanbul, Armendáriz was diagnosed with inoperable cancer. Filming in Istanbul was terminated, the production moved to Britain, and Armendáriz's scenes were brought forward {{so that he could}} complete his scenes without delay. Though visibly in pain, he continued working as long as possible. When he could no longer work, he returned home and took his own life. Remaining shots after Armendáriz left London had <b>a</b> <b>stunt</b> double and Terence Young himself as stand-ins.|$|E

5|$|Over the years, {{atmosphere}} performers {{have disappeared}} from most {{sections of the}} park, including Medieval Faire. Two entertainment areas have remained constant in the section, a proscenium theatre and <b>a</b> <b>stunt</b> and acrobatic space surrounded by water. Currently named Wonderland Theatre, the indoor facility has hosted a variety of stage show revues, ice shows, and now an acrobatic production, Cirque Ambiente. A structure within Arthur's Baye initially featured a pirate diving and acrobatics show, which has changed now {{to have a more}} generic theme; it is currently branded Kinet–X.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} April 25, 2011, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with the working title Group Hug. In June 2011, stuntman Jeremy Fitzgerald injured his head while attempting <b>a</b> <b>stunt</b> involving a 30-foot fall from a building after {{getting hit by}} an arrow. A Marvel spokesperson later told TMZ.com that despite the injury, Fitzgerald recovered and continued working on set. The following month, secondary filming took place about an hour outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the Butler area. A chase sequence was also shot in Worthington, Pennsylvania at Creekside Mushroom Farms, the world's largest single-site mushroom farm, which provided 150 miles of abandoned limestone tunnels 300 feet below the ground for filming.|$|E
5|$|Salt {{received}} one Academy Award nomination, for Best Sound Mixing (Jeffrey J. Haboush, Greg P. Russell, Scott Millan and William Sarokin), which it lost to Inception.
