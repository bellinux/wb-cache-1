2500|$|According to Meyer, {{the book}} was {{inspired}} and influenced by Wuthering Heights by Emily Brontë, although she does not like the book. She said that characters of the book fascinate her and she enjoys reading certain parts, but does not enjoy the book as a whole because she finds it very depressing—an opinion expressed by Edward in Eclipse. When comparing Edward and Jacob to Heathcliff and Edgar Linton of Wuthering Heights, she said, [...] "You could look at Edward and Jacob from one perspective and say: Okay, this one is Heathcliff <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> Edgar. And someone else might say: No, wait a second. Because of this reason and that reason, that one is Heathcliff {{and the other one}} is Edgar...I like that confusion, because that's how life is."

Michael Fennelly and Richie Hogan grabbed the vital goals, late in each half, while Henry Shefflin celebrated his record-equalling eighth title triumph with a seven-points haul.
