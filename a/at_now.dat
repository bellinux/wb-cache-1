Sinead then {{gives birth to}} her baby Katy which Diane initially adopts although Sinead then wants the baby and moves in with drug-dealer Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson). Sinead then starts drug-dealing and is reported to social services. Tony accuses Diane of reporting Sinead and is furious with her. He then moves in with Cindy. Diane later finds out about Tony's cancer, however, and Tony and Diane then re-unite with Tony moving back in with Diane. In October 2013, Tony and Diane decide {{to go to the}} seaside the day that Tony will get the news about whether his cancer has cleared or not. Tony and Diane discover that they met when they were children at the same seaside they are <b>at</b> <b>now.</b> Diane suddenly goes in to labor and she is rushed to the hospital. Tony's phone frequently rings as he is about to be told the news about his cancer, although he refuses to pick up as he wants to see Diane give birth to their children first. Diane gives birth to a boy named Anthony (the name Diane knew Tony as when they met as children) and Dee Dee (the name Tony knew Diane as). After this, Tony picks up his phone and is thrilled when he is told that his cancer has been cleared.|$|E
500|$|From Castaic Junction {{north to}} Castaic the Ridge Route {{has been largely}} buried by the Ridge Route Alternate and Interstate 5. At Castaic the Ridge Route Alternate turned {{northwest}} from the old road <b>at</b> , <b>now</b> the intersection of Castaic Road and Neely Street. The first piece of Ridge Route Road out of Castaic has been realigned {{as recently as the}} late 1990s when the North Lake housing development was built. The road begins to climb after passing North Lake; a portion was straightened in 1924 and now is next to the southbound lanes of I-5. In this area, known as the Five-Mile Grade, the four-lane Ridge Route Alternate became the northbound lanes of I-5, while the added four-lane alignment, built to the east (next to the old Ridge Route), had lower grades and became the southbound (downhill) lanes to cut down on runaway trucks. Two bridges were built to allow traffic to cross to the left side. Near the north end of this area, the Ridge Route curves away from the newer bypass. The road enters the Angeles National Forest about [...] south of Templin Highway, with the Forest Service road designation 8N04.|$|E

2500|$|Inspired by Charles Schulz's Peanuts and Outhouses of the North, a small book of {{cartoons}} {{published by}} Highway Bookshop in Northern Ontario, Sim spent 1975 and 1976 developing a comic strip called The Beavers.

[...] He decided that publishers were unreliable, and that the solution would be syndication. [...] He pitched The Beavers to the Kitchener-Waterloo Record.

[...] He had work published by Charlton and Warren [...] In 1976, Sim took the only job he ever held outside of the comics field as an employee <b>at</b> <b>Now</b> & Then Books, of which he has said, [...] "It {{was the only place}} in Kitchener that I ever felt truly comfortable before or since".|$|E

I do not for one moment go to the length of imagining that the present negotiations will go far to shape the future form of Arabia or to either establish our rights or to bind our hands in that country. The situation and its elements are much too nebulous for that. What we have to arrive <b>at</b> <b>now</b> is to tempt the Arab people into the right path, detach them from the enemy and bring them on to our side. This on our part is at present largely a matter of words, and to succeed we must use persuasive terms and abstain from academic haggling over conditions – whether about Baghdad or elsewhere.|$|E

2500|$|Zindler {{began his}} {{broadcasting}} career in 1943 {{as a part-time}} night radio disc jockey and spot news reporter <b>at</b> <b>now</b> defunct Houston radio station KATL-AM while working for his family's clothing store. Beginning in 1951, when he worked for KATL, he hosted The Roving Mike, a 30-minute radio program airing on Sundays that documented crime and {{the people involved in}} Houston. In 1950 Zindler became a reporter and cameraman for Southwest Film Production Company which produced the 6 P. M. news for KPRC-TV, but in 1954, he was fired by an executive who said he was [...] "too ugly" [...] to work in TV. Two years later, Zindler joined the Scripps Howard Houston Press to work part-time as a crime reporter and photographer. While working for the newspaper and his father's store, Zindler became dissatisfied with the retail business and in 1962 took a career detour to join the Harris County Sheriff's Office. He handled Civil Process for two years and then joined the Fugitive Squad where his work took him {{all over the world to}} extradite fugitives.|$|E
2500|$|Currents {{received}} acclaim {{from music}} critics. On Metacritic, the album holds an average critic score of 84, based on 38 critics, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". Ian Cohen of Pitchfork gave the album a [...] "Best New Music" [...] designation, saying, [...] "Nearly every proper song on Currents is a revelatory statement of Parker's range and increasing expertise as a producer, arranger, songwriter, and vocalist {{while maintaining the}} essence of Tame Impala". Cohen compared the record to others such as Loveless, Kid A, and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, writing, [...] "it's {{the result of a}} supernaturally talented obsessive trying to perfect music while redefining their relationship to album-oriented rock." [...] Spins Harley Brown called it [...] "the purest— and most complex— distillation of everything that makes the band such a nearly physical pleasure to listen to". Brown added, [...] "The real magic of Currents, though, is in how Parker so effectively (and genuinely, for the most part) manipulates the listener's emotions without necessarily revealing any himself." [...] Alex Denney of NME praised Parker for his musical transition, writing, [...] "Fuzzed-out guitars simply aren't where Parker's head is <b>at</b> <b>now,</b> which strikes us as a fair trade-off from a producer pushing at the outer reaches of his talent." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ma Yinchu {{was born}} in a family <b>at</b> <b>now</b> Shengzhou City, a county-level city that is {{administered}} by Shaoxing, in Zhejiang province. He was the fifth child of the owner of a small distillery that specialized in fermented rice liquor. While his father wished for him to carry on this business, Ma showed an inclination toward scholarship. As a result, his father cut him off financially, and their relationship never recovered. At 16, Ma attended middle school in Shanghai. Despite losing his father's support, he studied mining and metallurgy at Beiyang University (now called Tianjin University [...] ). In 1907, Ma received government sponsorship to study economics at Yale University, after which he received a Ph.D. in economics and philosophy from Columbia University in 1914. In 1920 he helped to found the Shanghai College of Commerce, and in 1923 he became the founding president of the Chinese Economics Society. During the 1930s, Ma began to criticize the Kuomintang government under Chiang Kai-shek, and was subsequently placed under house arrest from 1940–2. In 1949, at the request of Zhou Enlai, he served as a nonpartisan delegate to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. From 1950 to 1951, he served as the president of Zhejiang University, and then as the president of Peking University from 1951 to 1960. In this position, Ma was well liked, and seen as warm and genuine by his students. However, he was removed due to his unorthodox economic views.|$|E
