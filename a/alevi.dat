5|$|Academics {{suggest the}} <b>Alevi</b> {{population}} may be from 15 to 20 million, while the Alevi-Bektaşi Federation claims {{that there are}} around 25 million and according to Aksiyon magazine, the number of Shiite Twelvers (excluding Alevis) is 3 million (4.2 percent). Under the Sunni Islamist government of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) and Tayyip Erdoğan, an increasing discrimination against and persecution of the <b>Alevi</b> minority has begun.|$|E
5|$|The Twelve Imams are {{the spiritual}} and {{political}} succesors to the Islamic prophet Muhammad in the Twelver or Athnā‘ashariyyah branch of Shia Islam, including that of the Alawite and the <b>Alevi</b> sects.|$|E
5|$|According to Twelvers, {{there is}} at all times an Imam of the era who is the divinely {{appointed}} authority on all matters of faith and law in the Muslim community. Ali {{was the first of}} the Twelve Imams, and, in the Twelvers and Sufis' view, the rightful successor to Muhammad, followed by male descendants of Muhammad through his daughter Fatimah. Each Imam was the son of the previous Imam, with the exception of Husayn ibn Ali, who was the brother of Hasan ibn Ali. The twelfth and final Imam is Muhammad al-Mahdi, who is believed by the Twelvers to be currently alive, and hidden in the Major Occultation until he returns to bring justice to the world. It is believed by Twelver Shia and <b>Alevi</b> Muslims that the Twelve Imams have been foretold in the Hadith of the Twelve Successors. All of the Imams met unnatural deaths, with the exception of the last Imam, who according to Twelver and <b>Alevi</b> belief, is living in occultation.|$|E
25|$|In December 2008, the Minister of Culture {{participated in}} {{the opening of the}} first <b>Alevi</b> Institute and apologised to the Alevis for past sufferings caused by the state. In January 2009, the Prime Minister {{attended}} an <b>Alevi</b> fast-breaking ceremony for the second consecutive year. The government held workshops aimed at openly discussing <b>Alevi</b> problems and expectations.|$|E
25|$|The {{two main}} Islamic streams in Turkey are Sunni and <b>Alevi.</b> <b>Alevi</b> are the {{minority}} in Turkey, estimated at 17 {{percent of the}} Muslim population. During the late 1970s, violent clashes occurred due to conflict between these two Islamic branches. In December 1978 militants in Kahramanmaras agitated the Sunni population against the <b>Alevi</b> inhabitants of the town, and more than 100 people were killed. On 2 July 1993, <b>Alevi</b> intellectuals were attacked in Sivas; the Sivas massacre resulted {{in the deaths of}} 37 people.|$|E
25|$|In {{the view}} of Australian {{anthropologist}} Sevgi Kilic, while <b>Alevi</b> women do not experience gender segregation in {{the private and public}} domain they are subject to traditional male values about women's sexuality and constructed within the honor/shame paradigm. This ethnography is the first on <b>Alevi</b> women in Turkey and argues that <b>Alevi</b> identity is complex, diverse and rich in its theory and practice.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the major}} {{traditional}} musicians in Turkey are <b>Alevi,</b> including Arif Sağ, Musa Eroğlu, Neşet Ertaş, Erdal Erzincan, Aşık Mahzuni Şerif, Aşık Feyzullah Çınar, Aşık Veysel Şatıroğlu, Ali Ekber Çiçek, Sabahat Akkiraz, Belkıs Akkale, and Ulaş Özdemir. Other non-Alevis, such as Ruhi Su, have recorded many <b>Alevi</b> songs. Mercan Dede, an artist whose music combines electronic and traditional Sufi elements, has made some songs involving <b>Alevi</b> themes in cooperation with singer Sabahat Akkiraz.|$|E
25|$|Alevis have a {{significant}} role in Turkish music and poetry. Pir Sultan Abdal, a 16th-century <b>Alevi</b> poet whose poems and songs often contain spiritual themes, is revered as a saint and hero. Important figures are the Sufi poet Yunus Emre, widely regarded as having been <b>Alevi,</b> and Kaygusuz Abdal. Their poems shape Turkish culture up to now, and are also performed by modern artists. Songs attributed to these poets have been embraced by left-wingers in the 20th century. The aşık bards are also influenced by <b>Alevi</b> tradition.|$|E
25|$|There are an {{estimated}} 16-17 million <b>Alevi</b> in Turkey.|$|E
25|$|Although its {{population}} is overwhelmingly Muslim, Turkey {{claims to be}} a secular country per Article 24 of the Turkish Constitution. The two main Islamic streams in Turkey are Sunni and <b>Alevi,</b> a branch of Shia Islam. In Turkey <b>Alevi</b> are the minority, estimated at 17 percent of the Muslim population.|$|E
25|$|The central <b>Alevi</b> {{corporate}} {{worship service}} is the Cem ceremony. <b>Alevi</b> worship {{and other social}} activities take place in assembly houses (Cemevi). The ceremony's prototype is the Muhammad's nocturnal ascent into heaven, where he beheld a gathering of forty saints (Kırklar Meclisi), and the Divine Reality made manifest in their leader, Ali.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{a native}} 3000 <b>Alevi</b> {{community}} in Western Thrace, Greece.|$|E
25|$|<b>Alevi</b> {{communities}} {{are concentrated in}} central Anatolia, in a belt from Çorum {{in the west to}} Muş in the east. The only province within Turkey with an <b>Alevi</b> majority is Tunceli, formerly known as Dersim. Beginning in the 1960s, many Alevis have migrated to the large cities of western and southern Turkey – and to western Europe, especially Germany – and are now heavily urbanized.|$|E
25|$|Some {{contemporary}} <b>Alevi</b> and Bektashi leaning {{religious or}} ethnic minorities in Anatolia are referred to, pejoratively, as Qizilbash.|$|E
25|$|Alevis accept Twelver Shi‘a {{beliefs about}} Ali and the Twelve Imams. Moreover, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini decreed Alevis {{to be part}} of the Shia fold in the 1970s. There are, however, <b>Alevi</b> philosophies, customs, and rituals that are appreciably {{different}} than those of Twelver Shias in Iraq, Iran, Lebanon. In particular, much of mystical language in the <b>Alevi</b> tradition is inspired by Sufi traditions. Some sources link Alevism in particular to the heterodox syncretic Sufi group known as the Bektashi Order, which was Sunni.|$|E
25|$|Groups of nomadic and {{semi-nomadic}} itinerants found {{mainly in}} central and western Anatolia. They speak an argot {{of their own and}} follow the <b>Alevi</b> faith.|$|E
25|$|In Turkish cuisine, wheat-based mixed dessert congee {{is called}} an ashure. It {{is a little}} similar with eight {{ingredient}} Chinese congee. It mostly uses seven, ten or twelve ingredients. The ingredients can vary spontaneously {{but it must be}} vegan (no animal-based ingredients) like nuts, fruits, grains and sugar. Twelve ingredients represent <b>Alevi</b> behavings called as Twelver. <b>Alevi</b> communities cook it at the tenth day of Muharrem, which is the first month of the İslamic calendar. It is a common dessert in Turkey, Greece and Albania.|$|E
25|$|The Turkish {{government}} oversees Muslim religious {{facilities and}} education through its Directorate of Religious Affairs, {{under the authority}} of the Prime Minister. The directorate regulates the operation of the country's 77,777 registered mosques and employs local and provincial imams (who are civil servants). Sunni imams are appointed and paid by the state. The Alevis pray in cemevleri (gathering places), which have no legal status as places of worship. However, the Kuşadası and Tunceli municipalities ruled in 2008 that <b>Alevi</b> cemevleri are places of worship. Three municipal councils recognised cemevleri as places of worship, granting them the same financial advantages as mosques. Administrative courts in Antalya, Ankara and Istanbul ruled that <b>Alevi</b> students should be exempted from attending the mandatory religion and ethics course, and a similar ruling by the Izmir administrative court was confirmed by the Council of State. In 2009 the state TV channel, TRT, announced its plan to air programs reflecting the interests of the <b>Alevi</b> minority.|$|E
25|$|Alevis are not {{expected}} to give Zakat in the Orthodox-Islamic mode, and there is no set formula or prescribed amount for annual charitable donation as there is in Sunnism (2.5% of possessions above a certain minimum). Rather, they are expected to give the 'excess' according to Qur'an verse 2:219. A common method of <b>Alevi</b> almsgiving is through donating food (especially sacrificial animals) to be shared with worshippers and guests. Alevis also donate money to be used to help the poor, to support the religious, educational and cultural activities of <b>Alevi</b> centers and organizations (dergâh, vakıf, dernek), and to provide scholarships for students.|$|E
25|$|Ordinary <b>Alevi</b> would owe {{allegiance}} {{to a particular}} dede lineage (but not others) {{on the basis of}} pre-existing family or village relations. Some fall instead under the authority of Bektashi dargah (lodges).|$|E
25|$|For some, the linking of {{the three}} seems polytheistic and not in line with monotheistic Islamic teachings, but Alevis counter that such people do not {{understand}} the bāṭenī (mystical) meaning of the <b>Alevi</b> equation of Allah-Muhammed-Ali.|$|E
25|$|Some of the Kurdish Alevis speak Kurmanji or Zazaki. Some Alevis are Azeris. Despite universalist {{rhetoric and}} in {{contrast}} with Islam in general, or the Bektashi order, <b>Alevi</b> communities do not generally acknowledge the possibility of conversion to Aleviness.|$|E
25|$|Alevis {{have been}} {{subjected}} to persecution (often deadly) for centuries. Due to this fact, some have been assimilated. It is not clear how effective the above study is in including those who might be more timid about advertising their <b>Alevi</b> origins.|$|E
25|$|For example, Câferî Muslims (mostly Azeris) and <b>Alevi</b> Bektashi (mostly Turkmen) {{participate}} in the financing of the mosques and the salaries of Sunni imams, while their places of worship, which are not officially recognized by the State, don't receive any funding.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of Kurds are Sunni Muslims, with Shia and <b>Alevi</b> Muslim minorities. There {{are also a}} significant number of adherents to native Kurdish/Iranian religions like Yarsanism. There are also minorities of Christians and Jews. Some Kurdish Communists and Socialists are Atheist.|$|E
25|$|North Nicosia {{is home to}} {{cultural}} diversity. Students from different backgrounds in the universities celebrate their national festivals with activities, at which their national dances and traditions are performed. Different religious groups conduct cultural activities; the <b>Alevi</b> Cultural Association is headquartered in Nicosia.|$|E
25|$|The {{folklore}} of Turkey {{is extremely}} diverse. Nevertheless, Turkish folk music is dominantly {{marked by a}} single musical instrument called saz or bağlama, a type of long-necked lute. Traditionally, saz is played solely by traveling musicians known as ozan or religious <b>Alevi</b> troubadours called aşık.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the Shia Muslims were {{discriminated}} in the Ottoman Empire as {{they were}} associated with their Iranian/Persian neighbors. In Turkey, relatively large communities of Turks, Kurds and Zazas are <b>Alevi</b> Shia, while some areas in Eastern Anatolia, notably Kars and Ağrı, are Twelver Shia.|$|E
25|$|Most <b>Alevi</b> {{activity}} {{takes place}} {{in the context of the}} second gate (spiritual brotherhood), during which one submits to a living spiritual guide (dede, pir, mürşid). The existence of the third and fourth gates is mostly theoretical, though some older Alevis have apparently received initiation into the third.|$|E
25|$|In June 2008, several Turkish {{newspapers}} {{reported that}} the Turkish military had commissioned three universities to research the ethnic demography of Turkey. The study was done in 2000 and included all ethnic groupings. According to the results, the <b>Alevi</b> population of Turkey, including those who currently reside in Europe, is around 10 million.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though many}} Turkic peoples became Muslims under the {{influence}} of Sufis, often of Shī‘ah persuasion, most Turkic people today are Sunni Muslims, although a significant number in Turkey are Alevis. <b>Alevi</b> Turks, who were once primarily dwelling in eastern Anatolia, are today concentrated in major urban centers in western Turkey with the increased urbanism.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} with the traditional secrecy of the Cem ceremony ritual, the events at these cultural centers and sites {{are open to the}} public. In the case of the Hacibektaş celebration, since 1990 the activities there have been taken over by Turkey's Ministry of Culture in the interest of promoting tourism and Turkish patriotism rather than <b>Alevi</b> spirituality.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, Kharijites were {{initially}} divided into five major branches: Sufris, Azariqa, Najdat, Adjarites and Ibadis. Among these numerous branches, only Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali, Imamiyyah-Ja'fari-Usuli, Nizārī Ismā'īlī, <b>Alevi,</b> Zaydi, Ibadi, Zahiri, Alawite, Druze and Taiyabi communities have survived. In addition, new {{schools of thought}} and movements like Quranist Muslims, Ahmadi Muslims and African American Muslims later emerged independently.|$|E
25|$|Turkey and Persia {{together}} {{have been}} a center for many Sufi lineages and orders. The Bektashi were closely affiliated with the Ottoman Janissaries and {{is the heart of}} Turkey's large and mostly liberal <b>Alevi</b> population. It has spread westwards to Cyprus, Greece, Albania, Bulgaria, Republic of Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, and, more recently, to the United States via Albania.|$|E
25|$|The Ottomans had {{accepted}} Sunni Islam in the 13th {{century as a}} means to unifying their empire, and later proclaimed themselves its defenders against the Safavid Shia state and related sects. This created a gap between the Sunni Ottoman ruling elite and the <b>Alevi</b> Anatolian population. Anatolia became a battlefield between Safavids and Ottomans, each determined to include it in their empire.|$|E
25|$|The Twelver {{jurisprudence}} {{is called}} Ja'fari jurisprudence. In this jurisprudence Sunnah {{is considered to}} be the oral traditions of Muhammad and their implementation and interpretation by the twelve Imams. There are three schools of Ja'fari jurisprudence: Usuli, Akhbari, and Shaykhi. The Usuli school is by far the largest of the three. Twelver groups that do not follow Ja'fari jurisprudence include <b>Alevi,</b> Bektashi, and Qizilbash.|$|E
