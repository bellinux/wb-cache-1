40|$|Cocoyam(Xanthosoma sagittifolium (L) is {{the third}} ranking {{carbohydrate}} in Nigeria and is intensively cultivated and consumed by resource-poor farm families in Southeastern and Southwestern parts of the Country. The crop has high potential as a food security crop but yields are very low and adequate research attention {{is yet to be}} accorded the crop for increased productivity. This trial was aimed at developing a sustainable technology for increased productivity of the crop. A field trial was conducted in 2000 / 2001 and 2001 / 2002 cropping seasons at the Crop Research Farm of the University of Calabar in the humid rain forest zone of Southeastern Nigeria. The eight treatments studied were control (zero inputs), 20 t/ha sawdust mulch, 200, 300 and 400 kg/ha of N P K 20 : 10 : 10 fertilizer rates <b>applied</b> <b>sole</b> and in combination with 20 t/ha sawdust mulch. A randomized complete block design (R C B) was used in three replications. The experiment showed that application of sawdust mulch and fertilizer consistently increased cocoyam yield with increasing rates of fertilizer applied. Sawdust mulch <b>applied</b> <b>sole</b> raise cocoyam yields above the control by 36 % in 2000 / 2001 and 52 % in 2001 / 2002. Combining sawdust mulch with any fertilizer rate resulted in significantly (p = 0. 05) higher yield than when the fertilizer rate was <b>applied</b> <b>sole.</b> A combination of sawdust mulch and fertilizer applied at 200, 300 and 400 kg/ha produced higher yields by 3. 4 t/ha (34 %), 3. 7 t/ha (29 %), and 3. 7 t/ha (19 %) than the corresponding sole fertilizer rate in 2000 / 2001. Yield increases in 2001 / 2002 cropping were 5. 7 t/ha (50 %), 3. 6 t/ha (26 %) and 2. 4 t/ha (13 %) in the corresponding treatments. The highest cocoyam yields of 4. 57 t/ha and 4. 71 t/ha in 2000 / 2001 and 2001 / 2002 respectively were obtained by combining sawdust mulch with 400 kg/ha of N P K fertilizer. It could therefore be concluded that joint application of sawdust mulch and fertilizer is beneficial to cocoyam and farmers should combine 20 t/ha sawdust mulch with 400 kg/ha N P K fertilizer for high and sustainable productivity of cocoyam in the rain forest zone of Southeastern Nigeria...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} in Akure, Nigeria on the effect of sole and fortified agro-industrial biomass for improving soil bulk density and porosity improvement, root growth and pod yield of okra (Abelmoschus esculentum L) The 20 organic fertilizer treatments were compared to chemical fertilizers (NPK 15 - 15 - 15 fertilizer) and a control (no fertilizer; no manure), replicated four times and arranged in a randomized complete block design. The results showed that the application of 6 /ha of agro-industrial biomass in sole forms or fortified with goat, pig and poultry manure increased significantly (P< 0. 05) the soil porosity, root growth and pod yield of okra compared to the control treatment. The soil bulk density was also reduced significantly compared to the control treatment. The amended woodash, spentgrain, cocoa husk, ricebran and sawdust with pig, goat and poultry manure reduced the soil bulk density values more than their ordinary forms. The NPK fertilizer and the control plots had relatively high bulk density and low porosity values. Spentgrain <b>applied</b> <b>sole</b> or amended with manure most reduced the soil bulk density followed by woodash, cocoa husk, ricebran and sawdust respectively. This explained why the spentgrain (sole and amended forms) treatments had the best soil porosity, root growth and pod yield of okra compared to others. The linear correlation “r” values between root length and pod yield of 2 okra were 0. 40, 0. 45, 0. 57 and 0. 68 at 1 % level for crop 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively showing that it {{is an important factor in}} the determination of okra pod weight.

40|$|Abstract: Plantain and cocoyam are {{traditionally}} cultivated in the humid agro-ecological zone of southern Nigeria. Their production has expanded from the fertile backyards or compound gardens {{to the field}} where the soil fertility can not sustain continuous cropping without external inputs. A field trial was conducted in Calabar in the rainforest zone of Nigeria, from 2000 to 2002, to assess the effect of mulching with sawdust at 20 MT/ha and NPK (20 : 10 : 10) fertilizer at 50, 100 and 150 kg/ha, on the productivity of plantain/cocoyam mixture. Fertilizer was <b>applied</b> <b>sole</b> or in combination with sawdust mulch and treatments were {{laid out in a}} randomized complete block design in three replications. The highest intercrop productivity was found in mulched plots fertilized at 150 kg/ha NPK. The highest plantain bunch and cocoyam yields in 2000 / 2001 were 21. 0 and 4. 6 tonnes/ha respectively, while in 2001 / 2002, their respective yields were 22. 0 and 4. 80 tonnes/ha. Plantain bunch yield in 2000 / 2001 in mulched fertilized plots exceeded that in the control by 45, 58 and 61 %, at the fertilizer rates of 50, 100 and 150 kg of fertilizer/ha, respectively. Yield increases in the corresponding treatments in 2001 / 2002 were 62, 73 and 74 %, respectively. For Cocoyam, the yield increases (2000 / 2001) in the same treatments were 72, 76 and 83 %, in 2001 / 2002, the increases were 79 %, 84 % and 88 %, respectively. The peak aggregate yields of the crops were 25. 6 and 26. 8 tonnes/ha in 2000 / 2001 and 2001 / 2002, recorded the highest cumulative intercrop yield of 52. 4 tonnes/ha at 20 tonnes/ha sawdust mulch(SDM) + NPK at 150 kg/ha. Thus, this level of crop management could enhance the sustainable productivity of plantain/cocoyam intercrop under field conditions...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this survey}} {{is an attempt to}} review the kind of machine {{learning}} and stochastic techniques and the ways existing work currently uses machine learning and stochastic methods for the challenging problem of visual tracking. It is not intended to study the whole tracking literature of the last decades as this seems impossible by the incredible vast number of published papers. This first draft version of the article focuses very targeted on recent literature that suggests Siamese networks for the learning of tracking. This approach promise a step forward in terms of robustness, accuracy and computational efficiency. For example, the representative tracker SINT performs currently best on the popular OTB- 2013 benchmark with AuC/IoU/prec. 65. 5 / 62. 5 / 84. 8 % for the one-pass experiment (OPE). The CVPR' 17 work CVNet by the Oxford group shows the approach's large potential of HW/SW co-design with network memory needs around 600 kB and frame-rates of 75 fps and beyond.

40|$|Fertilization of staple cereal {{crops in}} {{smallholder}} farming systems of sub-Saharan Africa has mostly focused on supply of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), despite the widespread deficiencies of micronutrients that include zinc (Zn). Cereal crops grown on granitic sandy soils occurring widely in Southern Africa have poor Zn nutrition. This {{study focused on}} evaluating the potential of different soil fertility management regimes in enhancing maize (Zea mays L.) productivity, grain nutritional quality and nutrient uptake on nutrient-depleted soils on smallholder farms of Zimbabwe. A preliminary soil fertility survey and on-farm experiments were conducted in different agro-ecological regions (NR) in smallholder farming areas of Wedza (NR II: 750 - 800 mm yr- 1) and Makoni (NR III: 650 - 750 mm yr- 1) districts in eastern Zimbabwe. The survey was conducted during the 2008 / 09 season to evaluate the effect of farmersâ€™ soil fertility management practices on soil Zn status and maize grain nutrient concentrations. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) extractable soil Zn from the different farmersâ€™ fields ranged from 0. 5 â€“ 2. 43 mg kg- 1 with the highest concentration associated with application of woodland leaf litter to maize. In both study areas, combined use of organic nutrient resources and inorganic fertilizers produced maize grain yields > 2. 1 t ha- 1, sharply contrasting the non-fertilized treatment which yielded 0. 80). An assessment of maize grain yield and quality benefits of Zn following application of organic nutrient resources and mineral fertilizers at different levels indicated that co-application of organic and inorganic fertilizers increased maize yields by 5. 5 -fold compared to the unfertilized treatment. Maize produced under leaf litter in combination with mineral NPK and Zn had the highest grain Zn concentration of up to 33. 0 mg kg- 1. Overall results indicated that mineral fertilizers as currently applied by farmers promote Zn mining {{and are likely to}} result in long-term severe deficiencies in soils. Integrated soil fertility management practices as currently presented to smallholder farmers are limited by lack of micronutrients which are required to improve available soil Zn, yields and nutritional quality of staple maize grains.

In 79 ears, this was combined with ossiculoplasty in a single-stage procedure. In> 71 % of ears, the results of audiometric testing were monitored for more than 2 years. The results suggested there was a significant gain in hearing following surgery, with respect to the postoperative change in both air-conduction thresholds and air-bone gaps...|$|R
5000|$|In the 1690s, Fatio {{discovered}} {{a method for}} piercing a small and well-rounded hole in a ruby, using a diamond drill. Such pierced rubies can serve as jewel bearings in mechanical watches, reducing the friction and corrosion of the watch's internal mechanism, and thereby improving both accuracy and working life. Fatio sought unsuccessfully to interest Parisian watchmakers in his invention. Back in London, Fatio partnered with the Huguenot brothers Peter and Jacob Debaufre (or [...] "de Beaufre"), who kept a successful watchmaking shop in Church Street, Soho. In 1704, Facio and the Debaufres obtained a fourteen-year patent for the sole use in England of Facio's invention relating to rubies. They later attempted unsuccessfully to have the patent extended to [...] "the <b>sole</b> <b>applying</b> of precious and more common stones in Clocks and Watches".|$|R
