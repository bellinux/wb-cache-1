5|$|Other {{propulsion}} problems included excessive motor vibrations {{at certain}} speeds which damaged various components (which {{was attributed to}} the removal of <b>a</b> <b>flywheel</b> and to corrosion caused by the fuel problems), and excessive fuel consumption in Collins at high speed (found {{to be caused by}} manufacturing problems with the turbines and turbochargers). The propulsion system was also found to be a secondary source of noise: poor design of the exhaust mufflers, weight-saving measures in the generator mountings, and an incorrect voltage supply to the battery compartment exhaust fans were noise-creating factors found and eliminated during studies by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation.|$|E

25|$|The Russian Empire had a {{long history}} of {{progress}} in the development of machinery. As early as in the eighteenth century Ivan I. Polzunov constructed the first two-cylinder steam engine in the world, while Ivan P. Kulibin created a human-powered vehicle that had <b>a</b> <b>flywheel,</b> a brake, a gearbox, and roller bearings. One of the world's first tracked vehicles was invented by Fyodor A. Blinov in 1877. In 1896, the Yakovlev engine factory and the Freze carriage-manufacturing workshop manufactured the first Russian petrol-engine automobile, the Yakovlev & Freze.|$|E
25|$|In late 1883, Daimler and Maybach {{patented}} {{the first}} of their engines fueled by ligroin. This engine was patented on December 16, 1883. It achieved Daimler's goal of being small and running fast enough to be useful at 750 rpm. Improved designs {{in the next four}} years brought that up to 900 rpm. Daimler had three engines built to this design early in 1884, and <b>a</b> <b>flywheel</b> was included in one of the engines. This design was smaller and lighter than engines by other inventors of the time. Daimler relied on hot tube ignition, until 1897, when he adopted the electrical ignition designed by Bosch.|$|E
25|$|A beta Stirling has {{a single}} power piston {{arranged}} within the same cylinder on the same shaft as a displacer piston. The displacer piston is a loose fit and does not extract any power from the expanding gas but only serves to shuttle the working gas between the hot and cold heat exchangers. When the working gas is pushed to the hot end of the cylinder it expands and pushes the power piston. When it is pushed to the cold end of the cylinder it contracts and {{the momentum of the}} machine, usually enhanced by <b>a</b> <b>flywheel,</b> pushes the power piston the other way to compress the gas. Unlike the alpha type, the beta type avoids the technical problems of hot moving seals, as the power piston is not in contact with the hot gas.|$|E

25|$|A pump drill is {{a simple}} tool used to make holes in light {{materials}} by hand {{and has been in}} use for centuries. The drill itself is composed of: the drill shaft, a narrow board with a hole through the center, a weight (usually a heavy disc) acting as <b>a</b> <b>flywheel,</b> and a length of cord. The weight is attached {{near the bottom of the}} shaft and the hole board is slipped over the top. The cordage is run through a hole near the top of the shaft and affixed to either end of the hole board so that it hangs just above the weight. The end of the shaft usually has a square hole made to fit certain sized auger bits or a simple triangular bit made to cut while rotating in both directions.|$|E
25|$|Having {{the beam}} {{connected}} to the piston shaft by a means that applied force alternately in both directions also meant {{that it was possible}} to use the motion of the beam to turn a wheel. The most simple solution to transforming the action of the beam into a rotating motion was to connect the beam to a wheel by a crank, but because another party had patent rights on the use of the crank, Watt was obliged to come up with another solution. He adopted the epicyclic sun and planet gear system suggested by an employee William Murdoch, only later reverting, once the patent rights had expired, to the more familiar crank seen on most engines today. The main wheel attached to the crank was large and heavy, serving as <b>a</b> <b>flywheel</b> which, once set in motion, by its momentum maintained a constant power and smoothed the action of the alternating strokes. To its rotating central shaft, belts and gears could be attached to drive a great variety of machinery.|$|E
25|$|The {{next few}} years brought {{innovations}} that are still popular in modern coasters. The shuttle roller coaster (non-complete circuit) was invented by Schwarzkopf in 1977 and realized at Kings Island with the Screamin' Demon coaster. These early incarnations used the weight-drop mechanism (as opposed to the later Flywheel methods) to launch the trains. Built in 1978, the Loch Ness Monster in Busch Gardens Williamsburg became the first coaster with interlocking loops. It is still the only coaster with this feature, as the only other coasters containing interlocking loops are now defunct: Lightnin' Loops, built by Arrow in Six Flags Great Adventure, was sold in 1992, and Orient Express of Worlds of Fun was demolished in 2003. The first Schwarzkopf shuttle loops with <b>a</b> <b>flywheel</b> launch also first appeared in 1978. Arrow's Revolution, Europe's first looping coaster, was built in 1979 at Blackpool Pleasure Beach of England. In 1980, Carolina Cyclone opened at Carowinds as the first roller coaster with four inversions. The Orient Express opened at Worlds of Fun of Kansas City, United States, in 1980, with the newly invented boomerang (also {{referred to as a}} batwing or Kamikaze Kurve), a single track element with two inversions.|$|E

5000|$|An {{advanced}} flywheel {{energy storage}} (FES) stores the electricity generated from distributed resources {{in the form of}} angular kinetic energy by accelerating <b>a</b> rotor (<b>flywheel)</b> to <b>a</b> very high speed of about 20,000 to over 50,000 rpm in <b>a</b> vacuum enclosure. <b>Flywheels</b> can respond quickly as they store and feed back electricity into the grid in a matter of seconds.|$|R

25|$|In 1920 the French {{automobile}} and aircraft pioneer Gabriel Voisin experimented with systems that modulated the hydraulic braking pressure on his aircraft brakes {{to reduce the}} risk of tire slippage. These systems use <b>a</b> <b>flywheel</b> and valve attached to a hydraulic line that feeds the brake cylinders. The flywheel is attached to a drum that runs at the same speed as the wheel. In normal braking, the drum and flywheel should spin at the same speed. However, when a wheel slows down, then the drum would do the same, leaving the flywheel spinning at a faster rate. This causes the valve to open, allowing a small amount of brake fluid to bypass the master cylinder into a local reservoir, lowering the pressure on the cylinder and releasing the brakes. The use of the drum and flywheel meant the valve only opened when the wheel was turning. In testing, a 30% improvement in braking performance was noted, because the pilots immediately applied full brakes instead of slowly increasing pressure in order to find the skid point. An additional benefit was the elimination of burned or burst tires.|$|E
25|$|This is {{followed}} by {{an examination of the}} attacks on the Pentagon. The film opposes the official story of Flight 77 hitting the Pentagon, alleging that the path of destruction does not match what a 757 would leave. In particular it claims that the size of the hole in the Pentagon, a lack of debris and, little landscape damage seem inconsistent with prior airliner crashes. It also alleges that too few parts were recovered from the crash site to reliably ascertain that they were of a Boeing 757, and that <b>a</b> <b>flywheel</b> observed at the site seemed too small to {{have been part of the}} aircraft's engine turbine. Experts officially declared that the wheel was part of the APU, but others say it didn't come from the APU of a 757 but likely from an E-3 Sentry aircraft. The film also claims that the alleged hijacker-pilot Hani Hanjour had difficulty operating basic controls on a small Cessna that he rented at a flight school, and that perhaps not even an experienced pilot could have maneuvered the reflex angle of turn at the airspeed and altitude at which the aircraft approached without going into a high speed stall. The film mentions three cameras on nearby buildings that allegedly caught the entire incident at the Pentagon on film, which it says the government confiscated and has refused to release in full.|$|E
25|$|But {{the most}} {{significant}} system introduced in F1 was the Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS), a system that stores energy created by braking that is stored through <b>a</b> <b>flywheel</b> and this saved energy is then channeled to the car's drivetrain to increase acceleration. A few well funded teams had tested this technology the previous year {{but it was too}} experimental and all of the teams' KERS systems needed more development to the point where none of them would be ready for 2009. Due to the recession, many more rule changes were brought in to reduce the cost of Formula One. Initially a standardised engine was proposed, but this idea was rejected by the teams, who came up with their own cost-cutting measures. These included a huge reduction in testing times and an increase in the required engine and gearbox mileage. Many teams voiced concerns over the cost of KERS and have suggested a standardised unit, but so far no such opportunity exists. The new rules and regulations saw a new order in 2009, with new teams Brawn GP and Red Bull Racing and their drivers leading the way, with Ferrari and McLaren having a poor season. However Ferrari started by the British Grand Prix {{to make the most of}} their car with a string of podium finishes and a race victory in Belgium, while a redesign of the McLaren challenger helped Lewis Hamilton to win two races and gain more points than any other driver after it was upgraded at the German Grand Prix. After dominating the beginning of the season with six out of seven race wins, Jenson Button eventually clinched the Drivers' title in Brazil, with Brawn GP winning the Constructors' Championship in its only season, before being taken over by Mercedes. Rubens Barrichello, Jenson Button's teammate, was second in the Drivers' Championship for the whole season until he had a problem at the Brazilian Grand Prix and was overtaken (in points) by Sebastian Vettel, a Red Bull driver, who won the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix to finish eleven points behind Button. Also, the major manufacturer teams were starting to disappear rapidly due to the worldwide economy crisis. In addition to Ford/Jaguar which had left in 2004, Honda had departed in 2008 also due to uncompetitiveness, Toyota and BMW both departed entirely in 2009 (BMW sold Sauber, a team it had bought in 2005 after its split with Williams even though in 2010 the team was still called BMW Sauber), Renault changed their involvement as a full works effort to engine supplier in 2011 and Cosworth departed entirely as an engine supplier in 2013.|$|E
