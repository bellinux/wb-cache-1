She {{grew up in a}} humble terraced house on 58 Pease Street on the Freeholders' Estate in Darlington and {{attended}} Dodmire School. The Lawsons were a working-class family that had relocated from Gateshead to Darlington several years before Mary's birth. Lawson's father, Thomas Ed Lawson (b. 1876), was an <b>assistant</b> <b>fitter</b> for the North Eastern Railway Company, while her mother, Jane Hood Lawson (b. 1875), died when Mary was only three. As a result, Mary was largely raised by her elder sister Dorothy (b. 1899). Mary also had two brothers: John (b. 1896) and Francis James (b. 1906) ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Calibration with LC-MS {{data may}} be {{accomplished}} with {{different combinations of}} curve fit, weighting, and origin treatment. Agilent’s Mass Hunter Quantitative Analysis software contains a Curve <b>Fit</b> <b>Assistant,</b> which allows comparison of over 100 different calibration options. Curve fit choices include linear, quadratic, power, logarithmic, second order logarithmic, and average of response factors. Weighting choices include equal, inverse x or y, inverse 2 x or y, and logarithmic. Origin choices include ignore, include, and force. The Curve <b>Fit</b> <b>Assistant</b> ranks calibration options by r 2, standard error, or maximum % residual error. We used the Curve <b>Fit</b> <b>Assistant</b> to compare various calibration modes while validating an analysis of zopiclone and benzodiazepines in blood. Methods: Data are from the validation of the analysis of 16 benzodiazepines and zopiclone from blood extracts, acquired on an Agilent 6410 QQQ LC-MS. Blood calibrators o...|$|R

After finishing four elementary classes, {{he worked as a}} manual worker (engine <b>fitter</b> <b>assistant,</b> then tobacco fermenter) in Nyíregyháza.

50|$|Consequently, {{he needed}} a younger, <b>fitter,</b> <b>assistant</b> to run {{training}} sessions, and chose the flamboyant and dynamic Malcolm Allison, who had recently departed Plymouth Argyle after a spell as manager. Allison had other job offers from Stanley Matthews at Port Vale, Raich Carter at Middlesbrough and Joe Mercer at City which he took after admitting he had always claimed a love to City after listening {{to them on the}} radio during the 1933 FA Cup Final.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports from}} a project, called NewsPilot, where we explore how context aware {{computing}} {{can be used}} to support mobile collaborators. An empirical study of journalists at a local radio station in Sweden has informed the design of a prototype system. The system is built using a personal digital <b>assistant</b> (PDA) <b>fitted</b> with a radio transceiver and filters information based on the users physical location in relation to geographic places and other users. Keywords CSCW, Context aware computing, Field study. INTRODUCTION The perhaps most common "filter" in everyday life is information selection based on location. So trivial, it is almost difficult to appreciate we tend to place information tags where they are most appropriate. We place the shopping-list on the refrigerator or the front door, but rarely in the bedroom. If we are looking for books on Software Engineering at the library, we will go to the section on computing to filter out all other types of books. However, the past [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates how {{location}} awareness can support local mobility. Location awareness, i. e. {{systems that are}} aware of where they are located, is an emerging trend in mobile computing. The paper starts with {{a brief overview of}} different types of {{location awareness}}, which are summarized and categorized. Further, two studies of local mobility is presented. Local mobility is a term used to describe people that are mobile within a certain area, such as in an office. The studies show that proximity of other people seems to be important for work. However, the overview of location awareness shows that not much has been done to use proximity of other users as a resource for mobile computing. We have also implemented a prototype of such an application that filters information based on the users physical location in relation to other users. It is built using a personal digital <b>assistant</b> (PDA) <b>fitted</b> with a radio transceiver. The prototype is currently being developed. The conclusion is th [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|Many {{of these}} illusions, {{together}} with others that involve appearances, disappearances or escapes, involve assistants being shut in boxes {{of one sort}} or another. This has led to the nickname [...] "box jumper" [...] which, although it could be applied to a male assistant, is usually inferred to be a female assistant. One reason that has been given for the predominance of women in this role is that the illusions sometimes require an <b>assistant</b> that can <b>fit</b> into cramped spaces and women have an advantage in that they tend to be smaller and more limber than men.|$|R
50|$|Will {{was born}} and raised on a farm just outside Peterborough, ON where he {{developed}} a strong work ethic, self-deprecating sense of humour, and a quick wit. He also learned to never shy away from a challenge. A Carleton University honours graduate in film studies, Will has been on a constant quest for a career to sustain his endless thirst for knowledge. After stints as a miner, an architect’s <b>assistant,</b> a pipe <b>fitter,</b> and a production assistant for an animation company, Will answered a call for a carpenter’s assistant for Mountain Road Productions’ Gemini-award winning series Broken House Chronicles. This led to three seasons of behind-the-scenes assistant carpentry on MRP’s hit series Me, My House & I along with production work on other television shows, specials, and films shot in the Ottawa area.|$|R
50|$|The magician {{recruits}} several {{volunteers from}} the audience. A female assistant is then introduced and {{one or more of}} the volunteers are invited to help her into a series of restraints, which consist of leather straps with short chains or cords attached. Four short straps are fitted as cuffs around her wrists and ankles, a slightly longer one as a collar around her neck and an even larger one as belt around her waist. As the first group of volunteers complete the fastening of the restraints to the assistant the magician presents a cabinet and invites the remaining volunteers to inspect it. The cabinet is just large enough to accommodate a person in a standing position and it is initially open at the front and back. A panel, with a series of slots and holes in, is presented and fitted to the back of the cabinet.The <b>assistant,</b> now <b>fitted</b> out with the straps and chains, steps into the cabinet. The chains are passed through holes in the side of the cabinet and secured to fixings on the outside. This leaves the assistant apparently held in a standing posture inside the cabinet, with her arms at her sides and with little leeway for movement. A second panel, similar to the first, is presented and fitted to the front of the cabinet. This second panel has a stylised silhouette of a female figure painted on it, which indicates the approximate position of the assistant who is now hidden inside.The magician then pushes a series of rods through holes in the front panel (these are shown to have emerged through matching holes in the rear panel). The first rods apparently serve to further prevent any movement by the assistant and later ones look as if they must actually be pushed through her body. In addition a series of blades are pushed through slots in the front panel so that it appears the cabinet is divided into sections, each of which is too small for the assistant. Finally, a large square-sectioned tube is pushed through the middle of the cabinet from front to back. It is demonstrated that it is possible to see through the tube and pass objects through it.The tube, the blades and the rods are then pulled out of the cabinet and the front panel is removed, revealing the assistant unharmed and still held in position by the restraints.|$|R
6000|$|But {{this is the}} [...] "unofficial" [...] side. Go forward {{through the}} gates under the mango trees, and set foot at once in sheds which have as {{little to do with}} mangoes as a {{locomotive}} with Lakshmi. The [...] "buzzer" [...] howls, for it is nearly tiffin time. There is a rush from every quarter of the shops, a cloud of flying natives, and a procession of more sedately pacing Englishmen, and in three short minutes you are left absolutely alone among arrested wheels and belts, pulleys, cranks, and cranes--in a silence only broken by the soft sigh of a far-away steam-valve or the cooing of pigeons. You are, by favour freely granted, at liberty to wander anywhere you please through the deserted works. Walk into a huge, brick-built, tin-roofed stable, capable of holding twenty-four locomotives under treatment, and see what must be done to the Iron Horse once in every three years if he is to do his work well. On reflection, Iron Horse is wrong. An engine is a she--as distinctly feminine as a ship or a mine. Here stands the Echo, her wheels off, resting on blocks, her underside machinery taken out, and her side scrawled with mysterious hieroglyphics in chalk. An enormous green-painted iron harness-rack bears her piston and eccentric rods, and a neatly painted board shows that such and such Englishmen are the <b>fitter,</b> <b>assistant,</b> and apprentice engaged in editing that Echo. An engine seen from the platform and an engine viewed from underneath are two very different things. The one is as unimpressive as a cart; the other as imposing as a man-of-war in the yard.|$|R
40|$|Background: This study {{examines}} {{the association between}} place of delivery, delivery assistants and perinatal mortality in Nigeria. Previous studies have found these factors {{to be associated with}} the risk of perinatal mortality. This study therefore aims to determine the extent to which these two factors predict perinatal mortality in the Nigerian context as this information will be useful in informing health policy decisions and actions in so far as a desirable reduction in childhood mortality in Nigeria is concerned. Methods: This study uses cross sectional design through secondary analysis of the 2003 Nigerian Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS). The variables representing place of delivery and delivery <b>assistants</b> have been <b>fitted</b> into logistic regression models to determine their association with perinatal mortality. Several other known risk factors for perinatal mortality such as maternal education and birth weight, to mention a few, have also been investigated using the logistic regression analysis. Results: 5783 live singleton births were analyzed with 194 newborns dying within the first seven days of life giving an early neonatal mortality rate (ENMR) of 33. 5 per 1000 and an estimated perinatal mortality rate (PNMR) of 72. 4 per 1000 live births. The results also show that place of delivery [p= 0. 8777] and delivery assistants [p= 0. 3812] are not significantly associated with perinatal mortality even after disaggregating the analysis by rural and urban areas. However being small in size at birth [AOR= 2. 13, CI= 1. 41 – 3. 21], female [AOR= 0. 57, CI= 0. 42 – 0. 77] and having a mother who practiced traditional religion [AOR= 4. 37, CI= 2. 31 – 8. 26], were all significantly associated with perinatal mortality. Conclusions: Place of delivery and delivery assistants are not good predictors of perinatal mortality in the Nigerian context. However various limitations of the study design used such as the issue of uncontrolled confounding may have affected the findings. Nonetheless, the increased risk of perinatal deaths in small babies and the decreased risk of death among female babies are consistent with other studies and have both been attributed elsewhere to biologic mechanisms...|$|R
