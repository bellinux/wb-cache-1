5|$|Abbe {{was born}} on 15 December 1915 in a village in Tokushima Prefecture, {{on the island of}} Shikoku, Japan. He was the son of Toshizo Abbe, who was the local school's {{headmaster}} and a kendo instructor, and his wife, Kote Abbe. The couple had four sons and five daughters, and Abbe was the youngest child in the family. On 4 September 1919, when Abbe was not yet four years old, his father drowned in a flash flood while training in the mountains. A young schoolteacher, Manpei Hino, subsequently became a father figure for the young boy and introduced him to the martial arts, including sumo. Abbe went on to become <b>a</b> <b>local</b> <b>school</b> champion in sumo.|$|E
5|$|An example may be <b>a</b> <b>local</b> <b>school</b> {{system in}} the United States. It {{receives}} {{a grant from the}} its local state government to support a new special education initiative, another grant from the federal government for a school lunch program, and an annuity to award teachers working on research projects. At periodic intervals, the school system needs to generate a report to the state about the special education program, a report to a federal agency about the school lunch program, and a report to another authority about the research program. Each of these programs has its own unique reporting requirements, so the school system needs a method to separately identify the related revenues and expenditures. This is done by establishing separate funds, each with its own chart of accounts.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the promised}} {{consequences}} of market-based reforms of state schooling systems {{was an increase in}} the diversity of curricula offered in schools. In this paper we utilise economic analysis to explore the influence of an increase in competitive pressures within <b>a</b> <b>local</b> <b>schooling</b> market on the curriculum offered. We identify market forces which encourage conformity and inhibit a speedy response to quasi-market reforms. Our analysis suggests a staged response to reforms, with the pressure to innovate being greatest for those schols with the least resources to fund curriculum change. We illustrate this outcome by reference to case studies drawn from research {{on the development of the}} 16 - 19 curriculum and the non-compulsory 14 - 16 curriculum in <b>a</b> <b>local</b> <b>schooling</b> market. ...|$|R

It is situated adjacent to the former facilities at Shenley Sports grounds, which Watford Football Club use for training purposes. They concluded it was “…essential to support the training facility”, that it would replace an existing building used by the club and that Arsenal’s community work “constituted exceptional circumstances”. The plans were referred to the Environment Secretary John Prescott, who ratified it, {{in spite of the}} area's position on the green belt. Planning permission was obtained in September 1998.|$|E
5|$|Leslie Andrew {{was born}} on 23 March 1897 in Ashhurst in the Manawatu region of New Zealand, the son of <b>a</b> <b>local</b> <b>school</b> headmaster. He grew up in Wanganui, where his father had moved his family having taken up a {{position}} in the area, and was educated at Wanganui Collegiate School. After leaving school he was employed by the New Zealand Railways Department as a clerk. He participated in the cadet program while at school, and later joined the Territorial Force. By 1915, he had been promoted to sergeant and had sat the necessary exams to become a commissioned officer in the Territorials.|$|E
5|$|In 1966 an {{exhibition}} at Leeds College of Art of paintings by the Cyprus-born British artist Stass Paraskos, entitled Lovers and Romances, was prosecuted by the City of Leeds {{police and the}} Director of Public Prosecutions under the Vagrancy Acts of 1828 and 1837, and the Obscene Publications Act 1959. When the exhibition opened it was allegedly visited by <b>a</b> <b>local</b> <b>school</b> group, the leader of which objected to an image depicting a woman masturbating a man. The exhibition was raided {{by the police and}} closed down. Despite luminaries of the art world speaking in Paraskos's defence, including Herbert Read and Norbert Lynton, and a message of support from Britain's Home Secretary Roy Jenkins, Paraskos lost the trial and was fined twenty-five pounds. The case was later cited in the report of a working party convened in 1968, under the chairmanship of John Montgomerie, by the Arts Council of Great Britain, to review the obscenity laws in England and Wales. In this report it was suggested the artist should not have been prosecuted in this case, even if the works of art were deemed obscene, as he was not the publisher as defined by the Obscene Publications Act.|$|E

5|$|In late 2008, Aamer Ahmed Khan of the BBC Urdu {{website and}} his colleagues {{came up with a}} novel way of {{covering}} the Taliban's growing influence in Swat. They decided to ask a schoolgirl to blog anonymously about her life there. Their correspondent in Peshawar, Abdul Hai Kakar, had been in touch with <b>a</b> <b>local</b> <b>school</b> teacher, Ziauddin Yousafzai, but could not find any students willing to do so, as it was considered too dangerous by their families. Finally, Yousafzai suggested his own daughter, 11-year-old Malala. At the time, Taliban militants led by Maulana Fazlullah were taking over the Swat Valley, banning television, music, girls' education, and women from going shopping. Bodies of beheaded policemen were being displayed in town squares. At first, a girl named Aisha from her father's school agreed to write a diary, but then the girl's parents stopped her from doing it because they feared Taliban reprisals. The only alternative was Yousafzai, four years younger than the original volunteer, and in seventh grade at the time. Editors at the BBC unanimously agreed.|$|E
5|$|Later, Mitag passed near several {{islands in}} Yap State, first {{affecting}} Woleai. On the island, high wind gusts of around 170km/h (105mph) knocked out power and downed breadfruit and coconut trees. The winds destroyed a few houses, forcing residents to evacuate to <b>a</b> <b>local</b> <b>school.</b> Mitag dropped heavy rainfall while passing by Yap state, peaking at 255mm (10.05in) on Ngulu Atoll. On Yap, the typhoon produced sustained winds of 56km/h (35mph), with gusts to 141km/h (87mph). The winds also caused an islandwide power outage {{that lasted for}} about two days, and damaged {{the roof of the}} Yap International Airport terminal. High waves and storm surge damaged coastal structures and flooded areas up to 150m (500ft) inland. The seawall at the capital city of Colonia was damaged, and portions of the town were flooded 1.5m (5ft) deep. The storm destroyed over 150houses on Yap, leaving hundreds staying in shelters. Across the island, the winds knocked down trees onto roads, and saltwater intrusion caused severe crop damage; most of the taro and banana crops were destroyed. Damage in the FSM totaled $150million, of which $100million from crop damage.|$|E
5|$|On 28September, the 6th Company of the German 920th Landesschützen (Local Defence) Battalion was {{captured}} by insurgents {{in the town of}} Gornji Milanovac. According to the journalist Misha Glenny, the Partisans launched an attack on a small German detachment based at <b>a</b> <b>local</b> <b>school.</b> They did not expect to capture the German garrison, but undertook the attack in order to generate new recruits from the surrounding area. The local Chetnik commander, Zvonimir Vučković, became aware of the Partisan plans and decided to join in the attack to avoid the significant loss of prestige that would result from allowing the Partisans to attack alone. The insurgents launched a morning attack against the school. Although they were successful in overrunning the sentry posts, the Germans' heavy machine guns soon stopped the assault. In 90minutes of fighting, 10Germans were killed and 26wounded. The two insurgent groups judged that continuing the assault would be too costly and Vučković suggested negotiating with the Germans. To the insurgents' surprise, the Germans surrendered. They were then taken away by Vučković and his men.|$|E
