Thanks to a welldeveloped underlying economic framework, we can draw on {{a rich source of}} analytic tools and theoretical techniques for designing individual agents and predicting aggregate behavior. For many narrowly scoped static problems, design of a computational market is relatively straightforward. We consider some issues that <b>arise</b> <b>in</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> design computational economies for broadly scoped, dynamic environments. These issues include how to specify the goods and services being exchanged,how these market-oriented agents should set their exchangepolicies, and how computational market mechanisms appropriate for idealized environments can be adapted to work in a larger class of non-ideal environments. ...|$|R
