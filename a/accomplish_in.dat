5|$|By 7June 1823, Etty {{felt that}} he had reached the limits of what he could <b>accomplish</b> <b>in</b> Venice, and was {{considering}} returning home. Soon afterwards he left Venice for Florence, with the intention of creating a full-size replica of Titian's Venus of Urbino, considered one of the finest works of the Venetian school of painting. Although the Uffizi management were hostile to this proposal, after 10 days of negotiations they allowed Etty to create his copy. His contemporaries considered it among the finest copies ever made of a painting generally considered to be impossible to copy. In late July Etty began the journey home, pausing for a further two months in Venice. On 8October 1823 Etty finally left Venice, travelling via Mantua and Geneva to Paris.|$|E
5|$|The {{collective}} leadership {{first set}} out to stabilize the Soviet Union and calm Soviet society, a task which {{they were able to}} <b>accomplish.</b> <b>In</b> addition, they attempted to speed up economic growth, which had slowed considerably during Khrushchev's last years as ruler. In 1965, Kosygin initiated several reforms to decentralize the Soviet economy. After initial success in creating economic growth, hard-liners within the Party halted the reforms, fearing that they would weaken the Party's prestige and power. No other radical economic reforms were carried out during the Brezhnev era, and economic growth began to stagnate in the early-to-mid-1970s. By Brezhnev's death in 1982, Soviet economic growth had, according to several historians, nearly come to a standstill.|$|E
5|$|As {{the term}} double burden might suggest, when people {{consider}} paid work vs. unpaid work, they often consider them as two separate entities - {{that the man}} or woman is doing one or the other, {{but not at the}} same time. In reality, men and especially women often undertake both paid and unpaid labor simultaneously, creating the issue of work intensity, where the person undertakes many activities {{at the same time in}} order to compensate for the time necessary to accomplish many things in one day. Household surveys often only let people write down one thing that they are doing at any given time, and do not take into consideration that they may be cooking while cleaning, or sewing while taking care of the children. Because of this, the time taken for child care and other domestic activities may be underestimated. This coping mechanism of undertaking two or more tasks at once can especially be seen in women in developing countries. For example, many Caribbean rural women use this as a method of increasing the number of things they can <b>accomplish</b> <b>in</b> a day.|$|E

5|$|John pleads with General Ashdown {{to delay}} the {{offensive}} so he can formulate a plan to extract the human captives, but Ashdown refuses and relieves John of his command. However, the Resistance disobeys Ashdown's orders and instead, await John's signal. Marcus enters the base, interfaces with the computer, and disables perimeter defenses so that Connor can infiltrate the cellblock and release human prisoners. Wright learns from Skynet (which assumes the form of Dr. Kogan on a screen), that he was created and built from the original Wright's corpse to lure John to the base; when the Resistance launches its attack, John will be killed, achieving the goal that Skynet had failed to <b>accomplish</b> <b>in</b> the past. The hidden signal that the Resistance received earlier is revealed {{to have been a}} ruse, and Skynet uses it to track down and destroy the command submarine with the Resistance's leaders aboard.|$|E

Strikers threw rocks and sticks; some attempted sabotage. Irving obtained a court injunction, and had supervisors sleep in bunkhouses at the plant. Clerks and bookkeepers were able to <b>accomplish</b> <b>in</b> 22,000 man-hours per month what the union did in 46,700. Irving managed to break the union.|$|E

Jefferys also taught Crewes the difficult art of being a horse whisperer for his role as Jim Ryan. Horse whispering usually takes years to learn, but Crewes was able to master this difficult skill in only two weeks.|$|E
25|$|Daoud had however {{achieved}} {{little of}} what he had set out to <b>accomplish</b> <b>in</b> 1978. The Afghan economy hadn't made any real progress and the Afghan standard of living had not risen. Daoud had also garnered much criticism for his single party constitution in 1977 which alienated him from his political supporters. By this time, the two main factions of the PDPA, previously locked in a power struggle, had reached a fragile agreement for reconciliation. Communist-sympathizing army officials were by then already planning a move against the government. According to Hafizullah Amin, who became Afghan head of state in 1979, the PDPA had started plotting the coup in 1976, two years before it materialized.|$|E
25|$|A basic {{distinction}} is between sculpture in the round, free-standing sculpture, such as statues, not attached (except possibly at the base) {{to any other}} surface, and {{the various types of}} relief, which are at least partly attached to a background surface. Relief is often classified by the degree of projection from the wall into low or bas-relief, high relief, and sometimes an intermediate mid-relief. Sunk-relief is a technique restricted to ancient Egypt. Relief is the usual sculptural medium for large figure groups and narrative subjects, which are difficult to <b>accomplish</b> <b>in</b> the round, and is the typical technique used both for architectural sculpture, which is attached to buildings, and for small-scale sculpture decorating other objects, as in much pottery, metalwork and jewellery. Relief sculpture may also decorate steles, upright slabs, usually of stone, often also containing inscriptions.|$|E

During the skirmish, Heldalf, the Lord of Calamity himself, appears before Sorey and he is almost killed, being rescued in the nick of time by an assassin called Rose. After recovering, Sorey learns that there are four shrines with trials that a Shepherd must <b>accomplish</b> <b>in</b> order to become stronger and decides that he must clear them first before challenging Heldalf again. During his journeys, it is discovered that Rose has a high level of resonance and she becomes Sorey's Squire, joining the party along Dezel, a Seraph of wind who was guarding Rose as part of a secret agenda. After the party completes the four trials, they fall into a trap by Symonne, a fallen Seraph who works under Heldalf. It is then revealed that Dezel's true objective was to enact revenge on Symonne for causing the death of his friend and disgracing Rose's guild. Rose is severely wounded during the battle, forcing Dezel to sacrifice himself in order to protect her, and Zaveid joins the party afterwards.|$|E

500|$|Torn {{was to use}} a {{modified}} version of the SPECIAL system; combat occurred in quasi-real-time, rather than strictly being turn-based. To achieve this, Black Isle Studios created the [...] "recovery system", in which action points were used to determine the amount a combatant could <b>accomplish</b> <b>in</b> a given amount of time. Action points were spent with each action, and based on what percentage of an acting character's total action points were used, that character would need to wait a varying amount of time before taking action again. For example, if two characters expend half of their action points, they will attack each other at the same speed, regardless of the point totals for each character. Exceptions to this were to include recovery being hindered by movement, using items, or switching equipment, which was always allowed, though it reset the recovery time.|$|E

[...] He went on to state that the episode featured more [...] "lighthearted" [...] content before what he predicted would be a return to more dramatic elements. Price Peterson, writing for TV.com, gave a positive review, stating, [...] "Great first episode back…There was a lot to <b>accomplish</b> <b>in</b> setting up the new environment and characters, but it still felt really organic to the series as a whole." [...] While criticizing the fact that the rape victims experienced a backlash against them, he enjoyed the characterization of Piz.|$|E
