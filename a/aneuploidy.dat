25|$|<b>Aneuploidy</b> is the {{presence}} of an abnormal number of chromosomes in a cell, for example a human cell having 45 or 47 chromosomes instead of the usual 46. It does not include a difference of one or more complete sets of chromosomes, which is called euploidy. An extra or missing chromosome is a common cause of genetic disorders, including some human birth defects. Some cancer cells also have abnormal numbers of chromosomes. <b>Aneuploidy</b> originates during cell division when the chromosomes do not separate properly between the two cells. Most cases of <b>aneuploidy</b> result in miscarriage and the most common extra autosomal chromosomes among live births are 21, 18 and 13.|$|E

25|$|Somatic mosaicism {{occurs in}} {{virtually}} all cancer cells, including trisomy 12 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and trisomy 8 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, these forms of mosaic <b>aneuploidy</b> occur through mechanisms distinct from those typically associated with genetic syndromes involving complete or mosaic <b>aneuploidy,</b> such as chromosomal instability (due to mitotic segregation defects in cancer cells). Therefore, the molecular processes that lead to <b>aneuploidy</b> are targets {{for the development of}} cancer drugs. Both resveratrol and aspirin have been found in vivo (in mice) to selectively destroy tetraploid cells that may be precursors of aneuploid cells, and activate AMPK, which may be involved in the process.|$|E

25|$|Most gross genomic {{mutations}} in gamete germ cells probably result in inviable embryos; however, {{a number of}} human diseases are related to large-scale genomic abnormalities. Down syndrome, Turner Syndrome, {{and a number of}} other diseases result from nondisjunction of entire chromosomes.

40|$|Background: The major <b>aneuploidies</b> {{that are}} {{diagnosed}} prenatally involve the autosomal chromosomes 13, 18, and 21, {{as well as}} sex chromosomes, X and Y. Because multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) is rapid and non-invasive, it has replaced traditional culture methods for the screening and diagnosis of common <b>aneuploidies</b> in some countries. Objective: To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of MLPA in a cross-sectional descriptive study {{for the detection of}} chromosomal <b>aneuploidies</b> in comparison to other methods. Materials and Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood samples of 10 normal controls and the amniotic fluid of 55 patients. <b>Aneuploidies</b> screening of chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X and Y were carried out using specific MLPA probe mixes (P 095 -A 2). For comparison purposes, samples were also tested by Quantitative Fluorescent-PCR (QF-PCR) and routine chromosomal culture method. Results: Using this specific MLPA technique and data-analyzing software (Genemarker v 1. 85), one case was diagnosed with 45, X (e. g. Monosomy X or Turnerâ€™s Syndrome), and the remaining 54 cases revealed normal karyotypes. These results were concordant with routine chromosomal culture and QF-PCR findings. Conclusion: The experiment demonstrates that MLPA can provide a rapid and accurate clinical method for prenatal identification of common chromosomal <b>aneuploidies</b> with 100 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity...|$|R
40|$|Motivation: Chromosomal {{copy number}} changes (<b>aneuploidies)</b> {{are common in}} cell populations that undergo {{multiple}} cell divisions including yeast strains, cell lines and tumor cells.

40|$|Aim Sex {{chromosome}} <b>aneuploidies</b> {{increase the}} risk of spoken or written language disorders but individuals with specific language impairment (SLI) or dyslexia do not routinely undergo cytogenetic analysis. We assess the frequency of sex chromosome <b>aneuploidies</b> in individuals with language impairment or dyslexia. Method Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping was performed in three sample sets: a clinical cohort of individuals with speech and language deficits (87 probands: 61 males, 26 females; age range 4 to 23 years), a replication cohort of individuals with SLI, from both clinical and epidemiological samples (209 probands: 139 males, 70 females; age range 4 to 17 years), and a set of individuals with dyslexia (314 probands: 224 males, 90 females; age range 7 to 18 years). Results In the clinical language-impaired cohort, three abnormal karyotypic results were identified in probands (proband yield 3. 4 %). In the SLI replication cohort, six abnormalities were identified providing a consistent proband yield (2. 9 %). In the sample of individuals with dyslexia, two sex chromosome <b>aneuploidies</b> were found giving a lower proband yield of 0. 6 %. In total, two XYY, four XXY (Klinefelter syndrome), three XXX, one XO (Turner syndrome), and one unresolved karyotype were identified. Interpretation The frequency of sex chromosome <b>aneuploidies</b> within each of the three cohorts was increased over the expected population frequency (approximately 0. 25 %) suggesting that genetic testing may prove worthwhile for individuals with language and literacy problems and normal non-verbal IQ.

25|$|<b>Aneuploidy,</b> {{which refers}} to {{abnormal}} number of chromosomes, can also be detected using non-invasive prenatal tests. Research previous shown an increase in quantity of cffDNA in maternal plasma for fetal trisomy 13 and trisomy 21, {{and it is not}} elevated in fetal trisomy 18. A number of fetal nucleic acid molecules derived from aneuploid chromosomes can be detected including SERPINEB2 mRNA, clad B, hypomethylated SERPINB5 from chromosome 18, placenta-specific 4 (PLAC4), hypermethylated holocarboxylase synthetase (HLCS) and c21orf105 mRNA from chromosome 12. With complete trisomy, the mRNA alleles in maternal plasma isn't the normal 1:1 ratio, but is in fact 2:1. Allelic ratios determined by epigenetic markers {{can also be used to}} detect the complete trisomies. Massive parallel sequencing and digital PCR for fetal <b>aneuploidy</b> detection can be used without restriction to fetal-specific nucleic acid molecules. Several cell-free fetal DNA and RNA technologies are under development to test a pregnancy for <b>aneuploidy,</b> mostly focusing on Down syndrome testing. Sampling of cffDNA from maternal blood for analysis by massively parallel sequencing (MPSS) is estimated to have a sensitivity of between 96 and 100%, and a specificity between 94 and 100% for detecting Down syndrome. It can be performed at 10 weeks of gestational age. One study in the United States estimated a false positive rate of 0.3% and a positive predictive value of 80% when using cffDNA to detect Down syndrome.|$|E
40|$|The major <b>aneuploidies</b> {{diagnosed}} prenatally {{involve the}} autosomes 13, 18, 21, and sex chromosomes X and Y.

40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{the occurrence of}} chromosome 3, 7, 8, 9, and 17 <b>aneuploidies,</b> TP 53 gene deletion and p 53 protein expression in chronic gastritis, atrophic gastritis and gastric ulcer, and their association with H pylori infection. Methods: Gastric biopsies from normal mucosa (NM, n = 10), chronic gastritis (CG, n = 38), atrophic gastritis (CAG, n = 13) and gastric ulcer (GU, n = 21) were studied using {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) and immunohistochemical assay. A modified Giemsa staining technique and PCR were used to detect H pylori. An association of the gastric pathologies and <b>aneuploidies</b> with H pylori infection was assessed. Results: <b>Aneuploidies</b> were increasingly found from CG (21 %) to CAG (31 %) and to GU (62 %), involving mainly monosomy and trisomy 7, trisomies 7 and 8, and trisomies 7, 8 and 17, respectively. A significant association was found between H pylori infection and <b>aneuploidies</b> in CAG (P = 0. 0143) and GU (P = 0. 0498). No TP 53 deletion was found in these gastric lesions, but p 53 -positive immunoreactivity was detected in 45 % (5 / 11) and 12 % (2 / 17) of CG and GU cases, respectively. However, there was no significant association between p 53 expression and H pylori infection. Conclusion: The occurrence of <b>aneuploidies</b> in benign lesions evidences chromosomal instability in early stages of gastric carcinogenesis associated with H pylori infection, which may confer proliferative advantage. The increase of p 53 protein expression in CG and GU may be due to overproduction of the wild-type protein related to an inflammatory response in mucosa. Â© 2006 The WJG Press.

40|$|Detection of {{chromosome}} <b>aneuploidies</b> in uncultured amniocytes {{is possible}} using fluorescence {{in situ hybridization}} (FISH). We herein describe the results of the first clinical program which utilized FISH for the rapid detection of chromosome <b>aneuploidies</b> in uncultured amniocytes. FISH was performed on physician request, as an adjunct to cytogenetics in 4, 500 patients. Region-specific DNA probes to chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, and Y were used to determine ploidy by analysis of signal number in hybridized nuclei. A sample was considered to be euploid when all autosomal probes generated two hybridization signals and when a normal sex chromosome pattern was observed in {{greater than or equal to}} 80 % of hybridized nuclei. A sample was considered to be aneuploid when greater than or equal to 70 % of hybridized nuclei displayed the same abnormal hybridization pattern for a specific probe. Of the attempted analyses, 90. 2 % met these criteria and were reported as informative to referring physicians within 2 d of receipt. Based on these reporting parameters, the overall detection rate for <b>aneuploidies</b> was 73. 3 % (107 / 146), with an accuracy of informative results for <b>aneuploidies</b> of 93. 9 % (107 / 114). Compared to cytogenetics, the accuracy of all informative FISH results, euploid and aneuploid, was 99. 8 %, and the specificity was 99. 9 %. In those pregnancies where fetal abnormalities had been observed by ultrasound, referring physicians requested FISH plus cytogenetics at a significantly higher rate than they requested cytogenetics alone. The current prenatal FISH protocol is not designed to detect all chromosome abnormalities and should only be utilized as an adjunctive test to cytogenetics.
