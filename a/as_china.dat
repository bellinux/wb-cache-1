5|$|As large {{consumers}} of fossil fuels, First World countries {{drew attention to}} environmental pollution. The Kyoto Protocol is a treaty {{that is based on}} the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was finalized in 1992 at the Earth Summit in Rio. It proposed to place the burden of protecting the climate on the United States and other First World countries. Countries that were considered to be developing, such <b>as</b> <b>China</b> and India, were not required to approve the treaty because they were more concerned that restricting emissions would further restrain their development.|$|E
5|$|As of {{the year}} 2000, about 15% of United States {{consumption}} of germanium was used for infrared optics technology and 50% for fiber-optics. Over the past 20 years, infrared use has consistently decreased; fiber optic demand, however, is slowly increasing. In America, 30–50% of current fiber optic lines are unused dark fiber, sparking discussion of over-production and a future reduction in demand. Worldwide, demand is increasing dramatically as countries such <b>as</b> <b>China</b> are installing fiber optic telecommunication lines throughout the country.|$|E

5|$|Completed in 1916, the Trans-Siberian connects Moscow with Russian Pacific {{seaports}} such as Vladivostok. From the 1960s {{until the}} early 1990s the railway served as the primary land bridge between Asia and Europe, until several factors caused {{the use of the}} railway for transcontinental freight to dwindle. One factor is that the railways of the former Soviet Union use a wider rail gauge than {{most of the rest of}} Europe as well <b>as</b> <b>China.</b> Recently, however, the Trans-Siberian has regained ground as a viable land route between the two continents.|$|E
5|$|Finless {{porpoises}} have commonly {{been kept}} in Japan, as well <b>as</b> <b>China</b> and Indonesia. Ninety four in total {{have been in}} captivity in Japan, eleven in China, {{and at least two}} in Indonesia. Japan has had three establishments designated for breeding them, and there have been five recorded births. Three calves died moments after their birth, but two survived for several years. This breeding success proved that porpoises can be successfully bred in captivity, and this could open up new conservation options.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the {{sustained}} rise {{in oil prices}} had only a limited impact on demand. It was a good year across all segments of the tanker market segments, but {{not as good as}} 2004 and 2005. Amidst high oil prices, geopolitical tension, and fears of disruptions to the oil supply, growing demand was the main driving force in the tanker shipping market for the year. As demand grew moderately in the United States and Western Europe, expanding economies such <b>as</b> <b>China</b> fueled exponential growth in demand. Despite these strengths, each of the five tanker freight indices dropped during 2006. Product tanker demand increased in 2006 due to economic expansion in Asia, especially China and India, however, average time charter equivalent earnings for these ships decreased compared with the two prior years.|$|E

5|$|Satellite {{observations}} {{record a}} decrease in snow-covered areas since the 1960s, when satellites when satellite observations began. In some areas, including China, snow cover has increased. In some regions such <b>as</b> <b>China,</b> a trend of increasing snow cover has been observed from 1978 to 2006. These changes are attributed to global climate change, which may lead to earlier melting and less aea coverage. However, in some areas {{there may be an}} increase in snow depth because of higher temperatures for latitudes north of 40°. For the Northern Hemisphere as a whole the mean monthly snow-cover extent has been decreasing by 1.3% per decade.|$|E
