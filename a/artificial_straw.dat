These eggs can be hidden for children to find on Easter morning, which may be left by the Easter Bunny. They may also {{be put in a}} basket filled with real or <b>artificial</b> <b>straw</b> to resemble a bird's nest.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{assessed}} {{the effects of}} climatic conditions and year‑period (month) on both qualitative and quantitative characteristics of bovine semen in Czech Republic. The semen was collected twice a week using artificial vagina at artificial insemination center Hradištko in period 2011 – 2013. The effects of collection month, average daily ambient temperature and average daily relative humidity on volume, sperm concentration and progressive motility above head of collected semen and also on number of produced <b>artificial</b> insemination <b>straws</b> of required quality were analyzed using statistical analysis (procedures: UNIVARIATE, STEPWISE, GLM) in software SAS 9. 3 (SAS/STAT® 9. 3, 2011). Collection month, average daily ambient temperature, average daily relative humidity, and breed {{had a significant effect}} (P < 0. 05) on all evaluated characteristics. The maximum values of motility and sperm concentration were found in March and in April. The highest volume of collected semen was found in July and in September and the lowest in November, when also the lowest number of straws was produced. Motility and sperm concentration were significantly influenced by average daily ambient temperature and average daily relative humidity, where the maximum values were recorded in average daily ambient temperature over 14. 85 °C and average daily relative humidity over 72. 05 %. The results are important to the management of artificial insemination center responsible for planning of semen collection, processing and <b>artificial</b> insemination <b>straws</b> production...|$|R

50|$|In 1996 Europe {{was faced}} with the crisis of Bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (BSE), and this brought a halt to heifer airlifts for two years. During this period the only animals that Bothar sent abroad were dairy goats. However Bothar continued to assist wherever they could with veterinary supplies, vehicles, <b>artificial</b> insemination <b>straws</b> and training literature. During this period Bothar was forced to broaden its scope and look in other directions for ways of assisting struggling families in the developing world. Bóthar began investigating other countries that needed assistance and also researched other types of farm animals that they could work with. This led, subsequently, {{to the establishment of}} both the chicken and pig projects in Cameroon. More recently Bothar have established bee projects in five African countries: Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda, Cameroon and Zambia, a breeding yak programme in Tibet and a rabbit programme in China. Following the lifting of embargoes after recent Irish foot and mouth outbreaks, the heifer programme has continued to expand and now operates in Cameroon, Rwanda, Uganda, Lebanon, Malawi, Albania and Kosovo and Bothar goats are now present in Tanzania, Kenya, Lebanon, Mozambique, Poland, Uganda and Gambia.|$|R
5000|$|Fleay's West Burleigh {{sanctuary}} {{was to be}} a {{place of}} research and education and David Fleay objected to descriptions of the place as a zoo. Fleay stated that [...] "It's a place where the animals are kept in conditions {{as close as possible to}} the natural environment - where they can breed freely and be studied" [...] and [...] "We're not in the job of sacrificing animals for the sake of showing them and I don't have a lot of time for many modern zoos."Many of Fleay's animals were transported from Victoria and so animal enclosures were built rapidly. By October 1952, Fleay had constructed an interim platypussary. This was a large concrete water tank with <b>artificial</b> burrows and <b>straw</b> at one end, based on his design at Healesville. Large aviaries for the sea eagles, wedge-tailed eagles and the peregrine falcons were constructed, along with accommodation for the barking owl, great eagle owl and white goshawk. The barking owls' cages were built close to the house so that David Fleay could hear them.|$|R
40|$|Whether {{chickens}} {{will make}} {{proper use of}} pasture is a problem experienced by producers of free-range and organic chickens. The aims of this project are to identify husbandry techniques and aspects of system design that encourage good pasture use. Two {{studies have been conducted}} comprising a winter and a summer flock. The aim of the winter flock was to examine the effect of outdoor artificial shelter on pasture usage. This was done for female Ross 308 birds grown to day 56, and ISA 657 birds grown to day 81. In summer, ISA 657 birds were grown to day 81. Treatments were either standard or enriched brooding, with pasture only or enriched pasture. Standard brooding was in a controlled environment house until day 42. Enriched brooding was in naturally ventilated houses in which birds had sight of pasture from an early age and access from day 21. Enriched pasture included <b>artificial</b> shelter, with <b>straw</b> bales and a conifer “wigwam” used to provide natural shelter. Chickens may be encouraged to go outdoors by brooding in a less “controlled” environment than that used for intensive broilers, and by allowing access to pasture when young. However, mortality was higher. Conifer wigwams may offer a means for more even use of pasture and better distribution of droppings...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} {{diversity}} of ground-dwelling beetle communities and their environmental relation-ships, and to understand their efficacy as habitat indicators and sensitivity to habitat perturbations, we used pitfall traps to investigate patterns of ground-dwelling beetle diversity along ecotones between the desert hinterland and desert-oasis ecotone along a desert edge in the southern Gurbantunggut Desert, including a disturbed habitat by desert highway protecting system. Our main results were as follows: (1) In total, we trapped 54, 527 individuals of 81 species, belonging to 14 families, among which Tenebrionidae and Curcu-lionidae were most dominant and accounted for 93. 65 % and 5. 14 % of abundance, respectively. Tenebrioni-dae was most abundant in the desert hinterland, while Curculionidae dominated ecotones {{both in terms of}} richness and abundance. All Platyope spp. showed a preference for aeolian sandy soil, while Adesmia aweiensis and Trigonoscelis sublaevigata sublaevigata showed a preference for alkaline desert soil. (2) Spe-cies richness, activity density, diversity, dominance, and evenness indices all showed difference among habi-tats (df = 32, P< 0. 05). (3) DCA (detrended correspondence analysis) ordinations of habitats based on ground-dwelling beetle communities or dominant groups showed that desert edge was the transitional area in our study area, and that communities on slopes were more similar to those in desert hinterland while those on interdunes were more similar to those in ecotones. (4) Factors including species richness and diversity, even-ness and dominance indices were linearly correlated (P< 0. 05) with soil water content, nutrient content, total N, and total P content. Among them, the correlation with soil water content was the highest, and activity den-sity showed the lowest and negative correlations with all environmental factors. (5) A significant decline in beetle activity density was detected within the highway protecting system (P< 0. 05); species richness, diver-sity index and evenness index all declined in the same area, although the differences were insignificant. The relative importance of main species also changed. Conclusions we can draw based on these results are: These communities show low richness, diversity, and evenness but high dominance and abundance. This becomes more pronounced as one moves from the desert-oasis ecotone to the desert hinterland. Desert ground-dwelling beetles showed certain habitat-indicative value at the family, genus and species levels. Soil type is likely the primary mechanism leading to the observed community ordination results. The negative re-lationship between activity density and soil water content might be a general rule of desert ground-dwelling beetle’s distribution at local scales. The desert highway protecting system within our study results has af-fected ground-dwelling beetle communities, and associated <b>artificial</b> plants (<b>straw</b> barrier, Haloxylon am-modendron and Calligonum sp.) might be the driving factor leading to these changes...|$|R
