5|$|Combination therapy—using {{medications}} {{of different}} classes together, {{each with a}} different mechanism of action—has been demonstrated {{to be a more}} efficacious approach to acne treatment than monotherapy. The use of topical benzoyl peroxide and antibiotics together {{has been shown to be}} more effective than antibiotics alone. Similarly, using <b>a</b> <b>topical</b> retinoid with an antibiotic clears acne lesions faster than the use of antibiotics alone. Frequently used combinations include the following: antibiotic and benzoyl peroxide, antibiotic and topical retinoid, or topical retinoid and benzoyl peroxide. The pairing of benzoyl peroxide with a retinoid is preferred over the combination of <b>a</b> <b>topical</b> antibiotic with a retinoid since both regimens are effective but benzoyl peroxide does not lead to antibiotic resistance.|$|E

5|$|Benzoyl {{peroxide}} (BPO) is a first-line {{treatment for}} mild and moderate acne {{due to its}} effectiveness and mild side-effects (mainly skin irritation). In the skin follicle, benzoyl peroxide kills P. acnes by oxidizing its proteins through the formation of oxygen free radicals and benzoic acid. These free radicals are thought {{to interfere with the}} bacterium's metabolism and ability to make proteins. Additionally, benzoyl peroxide is mildly effective at breaking down comedones and inhibiting inflammation. Benzoyl peroxide may be paired with <b>a</b> <b>topical</b> antibiotic or retinoid such as benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide/adapalene, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, in a {{paper in}} Astrophysics: <b>A</b> <b>Topical</b> Symposium, Gerard Kuiper speculated on a similar disc having formed early in the Solar System's evolution, {{but he did not}} think that such a belt still existed today.

Were Kuiper's hypothesis correct, there would not be a Kuiper belt today.|$|E

Bibesco, the Prince's destitute son, continued to employ Caion as his defender and co-author: in 1901, they published an ampler work {{on the subject of}} Bibescu family grievances against the modern Romanian establishment.

5|$|The {{oxidation}} state +5 {{can be produced}} by dissolving manganese dioxide in molten sodium nitrite.

Potassium permanganate, also called Condy's crystals, is a commonly used laboratory reagent because of its oxidizing properties; it is used as <b>a</b> <b>topical</b> medicine (for example, {{in the treatment of}} fish diseases).

It continued north and as such made landfall on mainland Mexico on September22. Georgette dissipated early the next day while located inland over Sonora. Although officials noted the threat for heavy rainfall across northwest Mexico and Baja California, damage was minimal and no deaths were reported in the country. However, remnant moisture moved into New Mexico, producing flooding that killed one person.|$|E
