40|$|Sicily is {{a region}} {{located in the}} {{southern}} Italy. Its typical Mediterranean landscape is appreciated due to its high biodiversity. Specifically, hazelnut plantations have adapted in a definite area in Sicily (the Nebroidi park) due to specific morphological and climatic characteristics. However, many of these plantations are not used today due to adverse conditions, both to collect hazelnuts and to reach hazel groves. Though a geospatial analysis, the present paper aims to identify which hazelnut contexts can be actively used for agricultural, economic (e. g., introduction of a circular economy) and energetic purposes (to establish a potential <b>agro-energetic</b> district). The examination revealed the most suitable areas giving several criteria (e. g., slope, road system), ensuring an effective cultivation and consequent harvesting of hazelnuts and (ii) providing security for the operators since many of hazelnut plants are placed in very sloped contexts {{that are difficult to}} reach by traditional machines. In this sense, this paper also suggests optimal mechanization processes for harvesting hazelnuts in this part of Sicily...|$|E
40|$|N° ISBN - 978 - 2 - 7380 - 1284 - 5 International audienceThis {{contribution}} {{focuses on}} the relationship between rural systems and biofuels production, referring to a more general relationship between territorial organisation and renewable energies. This is a very crucial issue, since energy production from renewable sources is assuming an ever more pivotal role in the most recent international debate on sustainable development. Biofuels represent, in Europe as {{in other parts of the}} world, a promising technology to produce fuel and one of the more realistic alternative to partially corrode the role of oil into the transport sector. Starting from the presentation of two Italian case studies, the paper aims at developing an interpretative framework to analyze the different perspectives/approaches by which the biodiesel production can interact with the territory (mostly rural but not only) and engage different actors. Through the distinction between an industrial and a territorial model and the identification of their respective challenges, potentialities and limits, the paper ends with a reflection on what Italian policies have been done until now to promote a domestic <b>agro-energetic</b> chain of biodiesel...|$|E
40|$|Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) {{has emerged}} as a {{promising}} crop among oilseed species with <b>agro-energetic</b> importance. Considering the nutrients required by the sunflower crop, nitrogen is the most limiting for yield, besides affecting its oil production. This study aimed to evaluate metabolism aspects and nitrogen absorption kinetics (nitrate and ammonium), in sunflower (BRS 324) grown under different levels of this nutrient in nutritious solution, under controlled conditions, in a growth chamber. Plants were submitted to two nitrogen concentrations (0. 2 mmol L- 1 and 2. 0 mmol L- 1 of N-NH 4 + or N-NO 3 -), in a completely randomized experimental design. The kinetics absorption parameters (Km and Vmax), fresh weight and accumulation of soluble nitrogen fractions and sugars were evaluated. Plants grown in 2. 0 mmol L- 1 of N-NH 4 + showed a higher Vmax, indicating a greater capacity for transporting - this ion. The stem presented a preferential accumulation of N-NO 3 and soluble sugars, acting as the main site of energetic reserve of the plant. Treatments with NH 4 + showed negative correlations between fresh weight and amount of this compound in the plant tissue, which may be responsible for symptoms of toxicity, resulting in a reduction in the root/shoot ratio...|$|E
40|$|Accelerating {{demand to}} reduce the {{environmental}} impact of fossil fuels has been driving widespread attention to renewable fuels, such as biogas. In fact, in the last decade numerous policy guidelines and laws regarding energy, the environment and agriculture have been issued to encourage the use of animal sewage as a raw material for the production of biogas. The production of energy from biogas in a dairy farm can provide a good opportunity for sustainable rural development, augmenting the farm’s income from traditional sources and helping {{to reduce the}} overall environmental impact of the energy sector. This paper investigates the trade-off between the environmental and economic benefits of an agro-energy farm in the Umbria region of Italy that employs livestock sewage and manure, dedicated energy crops (corn and triticale silage) and olive waste. The environmental analysis was performed using the LCA methodology, while the economic investigation was carried out by reconstructing the economic balance of the <b>agro-energetic</b> supply chain based on the budgets of each activity performed. The LCA results show, on the one hand, the predominant weight of producing dedicated crops compared to all other processes in the supply chain and, on the other hand, a significant reduction in environmental impact compared to that caused by energy production from fossil fuels. Economic analysis revealed that the results depend significantly on what rate per kWh the government incentives guarantee to agricultural producers of renewable energy...|$|E
40|$|In the Third World, the Oil Crisis has {{emphasized}} {{the vulnerability of}} certain large oil-importing countries, engaged in an extensive process of industrialization. The author asks whether Brazil's response to this new challenge will emerge from a tradition of direct State involvement in Energy (exemplified by PETROBRAS), or an original strategy based on the private sector. Both the personal commitment of General Geisel to enhance the national bourgeoisie, and the general context of the mid-Seventies, favour the latter. As the locally-owned sugar-producing oligopoly promotes an alcohol program to replace gasoline, the State is seeking a loose formula [...] an Alliance of the <b>agro-energetic</b> sector with the multinational automobile industry and PETROBRAS. Its success {{would be based on}} the performance of each actor. Given a tradition of susceptibility of the Brazilian State to internal lobbying, and the choice in favour of indirect involvement in the program, {{it is not surprising that}} controls remained largely ineffective. Further structural limitations [...] an archaic agriculture resulting in low productivity of land, a lack of private funding, and technological deficiencies (caused by inadequate R & D activities) [...] induced the failure of the program in its original conception. However, the national bourgeoisie's fear of foreign control lead the military to veto the possible alternative of further internationalization of the alcohol sector. It remains to be seen, in the light of the weakening position of Brazil in the world economy, if such a stance can be maintained in the long term...|$|E
