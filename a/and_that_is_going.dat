It is useful to restrict the scope of exploratory research in one way or another, mode and domain offering themselves as clear and reasonably unproblematic limiters in language sampling. What makes the academic domain suitable for ELF research is that it is demanding, deeply influential, and largely constituted by its own specific genres.

40|$|Radiative {{shock waves}} play {{a pivotal role}} in the {{transport}} energy into the stellar medium. This fact has led to many efforts to scale the astrophysical phenomena to accessible laboratory conditions and their study has been highlighted as an area requiring further experimental investigations. Low density material with high atomic mass is suitable to achieve radiative regime, and, therefore, low density xenon gas is commonly used for the medium in which the radiative shocks such as radiative blast waves propagate. In this work, by means of collisional-radiative steady-state calculations, a characterization and an analysis of microscopic magnitudes of laboratory blast waves launched in xenon clusters are made. Thus, for example, the average ionization, the charge state distribution, the cooling time or photon mean free paths are studied. Furthermore, for a particular experiment, the effects of the self-absorption and self-emission in the specific intensity emitted by the shock front <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> through the radiative precursor are investigated. Finally, for that experiment, since the electron temperature is not measured experimentally, an estimation of this magnitude is made both for the shock shell and the radiative precursor...|$|E

It is linked to the consumer wants to sit in their homes where they quietly can make their purchase. Another significant factor is that the screen size is too small on the smartphone.

40|$|Salmo trutta {{is one of}} {{the most}} studied species in Europe, however, the populations that live in the lakes of the Pyrenees are little known. The most {{outstanding}} fact of this lack of knowledge is the ignorance that these fish populations are not native of these habitats and, therefore, they are one of the major causes of the decline of biodiversity of these ecosystems. LIFE + LIMNOPIRINEUS, that began the summer of 2014 <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to run for five years, it has the objective of improving the conservation status of species and aquatic habitats in the high mountains of the Pyrenees. The removal of this non-native species {{is one of the}} actions to achieve this improving and with the sampled individuals from the lakes it has been possible to do the next research that have the aim to realize a characterization of the populations of Salmo trutta present in the high mountain lakes of the Pyrenees. This characterization is done by the measurements of the furcal length and the determination of the ages of each individual by the otoliths reading, which allow to describe the growth and the survival of the populations present in these habitats by the adjusting of the models Von Bertalanffy and constant survival, respectively. Moreover, has been done an analysis of the body pigmentation pattern of each trout for knowing its linage. The ages obtained by the otoliths readings show unstructured populations with a poor density of young individuals. The parameters obtained by the growth corves indicated moderate asymptotic lengths compared with others freshwater ecosystems and little differences between the growth rates. On the other hand, the mortality rates, obtained by the adjustment of the survival constant model, are quite similar between the different lakes. Nevertheless, these little differences can be related with the lakes characteristics like the depth, the surface or the presence of the specie Phoxinus sp. Finally, the analysis of the body pigmentation pattern shows two different patterns: lakes with dominance of Mediterranean lineage or lakes with a strong presence of Atlantic lineag...|$|E
40|$|Wireless ad hoc {{networks}} are advancing rapidly, both {{in research and}} more and more into our everyday lives. Wireless sensor {{networks are}} a prime example of a new technology that has gained a lot of attention in the literature, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to enhance the way we view and interact with the environment. These ad hoc and sensor networks are modeled by communication graphs which give the communication links between some devices or nodes equipped with wireless transceivers or radios. The nature of wireless transmissions does not lead to an arbitrary network topology, but creates a network with certain properties. These properties include the important structure of bounded growth. In this thesis, we look at the structures and resulting optimization problems of independent and dominating sets in on graphs that model wireless communication networks. Independent and dominating sets are prominently used in the efficient organization of large-scale wireless ad hoc and sensor networks. In a communication graph, an independent set consists of vertices that cannot communicate with one another directly. Such a set is commonly used in clustering strategies, e. g. to obtain a hierarchical view of the network. A dominating set is given by a set of vertices so that every vertex in the graph is either in this set, or adjacent to a vertex from this set. Dominating sets of small cardinality are frequently used for backbone structures in communication networks, e. g. to obtain efficient multi-hop routing protocols. For the optimization problems of seeking independent sets of large cardinality or weight (Maximum Independent Set problem), and seeking dominating sets of small cardinality (Minimum Dominating Set problem) on graphs of polynomially bounded growth, we present and discuss polynomial-time approximation schemes (PTAS). The algorithms presented are robust {{in the sense that they}} accept an undirected graph, and return a desired solution or a certificate that shows that the instance does not satisfy the structural properties of a wireless communication graph. Wireless ad hoc and sensor networks usually lack a central control instance. Local, distributed algorithms are designed to operate in such a scenario. We propose a fast local algorithm that constructs a so-called maximal independent set, which is also dominating. We also extend the ideas behind the centrally executed PTAS towards a local approach. This gives a distributed approximation scheme for the Maximum Independent Set and Minimum Dominating Set problems on wireless communication graphs. The second part of the thesis is devoted to an application of independent and dominating sets in a wireless sensor network. We present the design of an energy-efficient communication strategy for low-resource, large-scale wireless networks that is based on an integrated approach stemming over various layers of the communication stack. The transmission of data packets in this scheme is done in a scheduled manner, thus reducing the number of collisions due to simultaneous transmissions. The approach, called EMACs, also includes the creation and maintenance of a connected backbone in the network that is used for implicit sleep-state scheduling of the nodes to conserve additional energy. Some results obtained from a practical implementation of this scheme indicate that the EMACs communication scheme improves the network lifetime compared to existing schemes for wireless sensor networks. This thesis answers and contributes to several open questions from the literature. The characterization of wireless communication graphs by the bounded growth property includes geometrically defined Unit Disk Graphs. By giving a PTAS that does not exploit geometric information for the Maximum Independent and Minimum Dominating Set problems on these graphs, we give a positive answer to the open problem of the existence of a PTAS for Unit Disk Graphs without geometric representation. Local, distributed maximal independent set computation has received a lot of attention in the literature, and a fast, i. e. poly-logarithmic distributed time approach is a longstanding open problem for communication networks in general. At least for wireless communication networks, we present the first such fast, local approach...|$|E
