25|$|During {{the first}} sixty years, the city's {{development}} was {{directly connected to}} the railway's activities. The town prospered during the rubber boom, but then when low-cost Malaysian rubber made rubber from the Amazon uncompetitive, the region's economy ground to a halt. Cities like Santo Antônio do Madeira, which had a tram line and a weekly newspaper {{by the time of}} Porto Velho's foundation, <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> ruins nowadays.|$|E
25|$|Porto Velho's {{modern history}} {{begins with the}} {{discovery}} of cassiterite around the city, and of gold on the Madeira River, {{at the end of the}} 1950s. In addition, the government's decision to allow large cattle farms in the territory began a trend of migration into the city. Almost one million people moved to Rondônia, and Porto Velho's population increased to three hundred thousand. This intense migration caused much trouble for the city. Among many other problems, the suburban boroughs, for example, <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> shanty towns.|$|E
25|$|Investigation of {{the sense}} of agency is {{important}} to explain positive symptoms of schizophrenia, like thought insertion and delusions of control. The core of the problem met by these patients is a disturbance of their sense of agency: the first rank symptoms, which represent one of the major features of the disease, <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> a loss of the ability to attribute their own thoughts, internal speech, covert or overt actions to themselves. Nonattributed or misattributed thoughts and actions then become a material for delusional interpretation and delirium. One primary source reports that the feeling of alien control (i.e., delusions of control) during a movement task in schizophrenic patients is associated with an increased metabolic activity in the right inferior parietal cortex.|$|E

500|$|Kylie had {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics. Chris True from AllMusic gave it two-and-a-half {{out of five}} stars, giving it a mixed review. He said [...] "While the production values on Kylie's debut are dated at best and the tunes <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> standard late-'80s Stock-Aitken-Waterman bubblegum, there are some rather endearing qualities to it. Firstly, she shows a lot more personality than the other Stock, et al." [...] He did say that Minogue would become a pop star and a [...] "European icon". Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave it three stars out of five. The stand out track, he said, was [...] "I Should Be So Lucky", as he said [...] "but anyone who denies 'I Should Be So Lucky' classic status has clearly let their tune detection muscles turn to flab". He also finished saying [...] "The bog-standard S.A.W. production renders Kylie as dated as that haircut on the album cover, and it's as loaded with variety as a loaf of bread, but the little Aussie pop rocket is already showing signs of personality and the record's quintessentially '80s charm ultimately wins through." ...|$|E
500|$|Music writers offered various {{interpretations of}} the video's style and concept. David Peisner of Spin wrote of the close-ups {{featured}} in the music video, [...] "As the camera sucks him in, it feels intimate and intrusive, revealing and voyeuristic". Music critic Jim Farber commented that D'Angelo's torso [...] "sways in grinding rhythm, tensing and releasing as his mouth curls in pleasure and his eyebrows narrow to measure an ecstatic contraction", while claiming that the video has [...] "nothing but close-ups of D'Angelo's buff body on the apparent receiving {{end of one of}} life's great payoffs". In his essay [...] "'Untitled': D'Angelo and the Visualization of the Black Male Body" [...] for his 1999 Wide Angle journal, journalist Keith M. Harris interprets the video to be a portrayal of D'Angelo's [...] "discursive play with masculinity and blackness". In his review of D'Angelo's Voodoo, Mark Anthony Neal of PopMatters wrote of the video in contrast to most music videos in R and hip hop at the time, stating [...] "One could call the video for 'Untitled (How Does it Feel)' narcissistic, but in an era when most R videos <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> 'bling, bling' and booty, D'Angelo's bare naked torso was refreshing". On the video's camera range and angle, Stephen Hill, a senior vice president for BET, had stated [...] "It stopped just north of the line where, you know, we would have had issues". A 2008 press release for D'Angelo described the music video as [...] "featuring D'Angelo as a shirtless Adonis that catapulted him into the stratosphere and firmly cemented his place as the reigning King of Soul." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for The Huffington Post, Carly Steyer {{credited}} Kim {{with teaching}} {{the importance of}} maintaining a healthy work-life balance: [...] "She paid an appropriate amount of attention to her schoolwork, and worked hard, but didn't slave over it {{to the extent that}} she didn't have any time left to save the world." [...] The character has also received positive attention from feminist critics; in her article [...] "12 Life Lessons 'Kim Possible' Taught Us That Are Still Pretty Relevant", Kadeen Griffiths of Bustle described Kim as an [...] "amazingly feminist" [...] character [...] "that taught girls that it was okay to overachieve, that worrying about boys didn't make you any less of a hero, and that you could invent your own slang and still sound (sort of) cool." [...] Griffiths went on to hail the character as [...] "our cartoon idol when it came to reaching for the stars and pulling it off flawlessly", concluding, [...] "at {{the end of the day}} Kim Possible could do anything. And so can all of us." [...] BuzzFeed ranked Kim ninth on its list of [...] "17 Characters From Your Childhood That Were More Feminist Than You Remember", with author Ellie Bate crediting the character with [...] "break the sexist stereotype that all cheerleaders <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> bimbos". Bustle writer Sarah Freymiller agreed that [...] "Kim offers a model for femininity that both bolsters and works against the typical 'high school cheerleader' stereotype." [...] Pride ranked Kim 11th on its list of [...] "13 Cartoon Characters Who Defied Gender Stereotypes". In her article [...] "Power feminism, mediated: Girl power and the commercial politics of change", Rebecca C. Hains of Salem State College cited Kim among several [...] "strong powerful girl [...] heroes" [...] who are responsible for [...] "breaking the mold by placing girls at the center of narratives with active agency and unfettered power" [...] during the early 2000s. MTV compared the character to American spy Virginia Hall in their article [...] "9 Cartoon Feminists Who Remind Us of Real-life Badass Women". While ranking Kim Possible: So the Drama the 12th most feminist Disney Channel Original Movie, Priya Krishna of BuzzFeed described Kim as [...] "obviously great". Comparing Kim to comic book superheroine Wonder Woman, Kathryn Shattuck of The New York Times wrote, [...] "MOVE over, boy wonders. The newest superhero on the block doesn't need a gimmicky mask or a jolt of testosterone to get the job done ... Kim Possible is ready and able to rescue humankind from evildoers without sacrificing her interest in boys and clothes." [...] However, in her book Girlfighting: Betrayal and Rejection, author Lyn Mikel Brown dismissed Kim as both a feminist and role model because of her alleged reliance on Ron's intelligence, as well as the observation that [...] "Her biggest threat is not evil, in fact, but the head cheerleader". Since her debut, Kim has proven herself a popular character among both girls and boys, although McCorkle admitted that [...] "whenever you have a girl in the lead doing all the action stuff, there’s a certain age group of boys who won’t admit they like the stuff. They really want to see the boy in that role." [...] McCorkle recalled an incident in which a fan of the show was very much surprised to learn that the writers were actually men upon meeting them; the fan had always just assumed that they were both young women because of the way in which they characterized Kim. At one point, fans of the character had sent her over one million e-mails via her interactive website.|$|E
