To avoid the adverse effects <b>of</b> the current <b>contract</b> procurement methods, Due Process mechanism was introduced. This study, therefore investigated the level of importance of due process by parties involved in the <b>award</b> <b>of</b> public <b>contracts,</b> the performance <b>of</b> Due Process and factors that may affect its functions. The survey was carried out by administering structured questionnaires and interviews on the practitioners in the construction industry that were in the private and public sectors. The data collected were analysed with the use of both descriptive and inferential statistics. The study showed that Due Process has become a new initiative being widely embraced by parties in public contract and has helped in saving public fund by corrupt practices that usually characterize <b>award</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts.</b> The study also showed that the absence of legal and other institutional frameworks were among the factors that affect the performance of due process in the country...|$|R
