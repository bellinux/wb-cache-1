40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{reliability}} and the validity of a modified version of the Multi-stage Shuttle-Run <b>Aerobic</b> <b>Test</b> 20 m. The proposed version is a hexagon with 10 m side distances each named Hexagon Multi-Level Running <b>Aerobic</b> <b>Test</b> 10 m. The same parameters (ending level, maximum speed and heart rate at the finish) were measured and the VO 2 max was estimated in both tests using the Multistage Shuttle-Run <b>Aerobic</b> <b>Test</b> 20 m protocol and tables. For the proposed test the reliability evaluation was ap-plied on a sample of 18 students (age 20. 8 ± 0. 9 yrs) twice with a 48 h time interval, giving high correlations in maximum speed and VO 2 max (r= 0. 99) and ending level (r= 0. 98). For the Hexagon Multi-Level Running <b>Aerobic</b> <b>Test</b> 10 m the validity assessment of the measured variables of this test were compared with the same variables of the Multistage Shuttle-Run <b>Aerobic</b> <b>Test</b> 20 m in 62 trained adolescents (age 13. 7 ± 0. 7 yrs). The validity coefficients for all the variables between the two tests were r= 0. 86 (p< 0. 01). Furthermore, the participants ’ performance profile was significantly higher in the proposed version, (p< 0. 05) while the mean VO 2 max of adolescents was significantly higher in this test than in the prototype Multistage Shuttle-Run Aer-obic Test 20 m (46 ± 6. 2 vs 40. 8 ± 4. 9 ml/kg · min), (p< 0. 05). Conclusively, it can be inferred that the Hexagon Multi-Level Running <b>Aerobic</b> <b>Test</b> 10 m is not only a reliable and easy to use test but also, compared to the valid Multistage Shuttle-Run <b>Aerobic</b> <b>Test</b> 20 m, it can be an objective test for the evaluation of aerobic per-formance in adolescents...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a simple technique to measure maximum aerobic capacity and relate this value to the person's state of training. Twenty trained and twenty untrained subjects ranging in age from 18 to 42 years participated in the study. Participants who accumulated in excess of an average of fifty Cooper points per week were considered as being trained, A re-test was administered to establish the reliability of using ventilation for measuring maximum aerobic capacity. The trained participants had a significantly greater mean level of maximum aerobic capacity than the untrained participants. Maximum aerobic power values correlated significantly with maximum aerobic capacity values, and maximum aerobic power and the participant's age had a significantly greater correlation than maximum aerobic capacity and the participant's age. There was no evidence that the maximum <b>aerobic</b> capacity <b>test</b> was any less efficient than the maximum <b>aerobic</b> power <b>test</b> for separating out levels of training, but the former was much easier to administer. Since maximum aerobic capacity was less related to age than maximum aerobic power it might be a better test for evaluating a person's state of training...|$|R

30|$|Tests {{according}} to OECD TGs 216 and 217 {{are used for}} the assessment of chemicals as required, e.g., in the context of regulation. OECD TG 216 describes a laboratory test that is used to investigate the long-term effects of chemicals on the microbial nitrogen transformation resulting in nitrate accumulation after a single exposure. The measured nitrate concentration reflects the sum of several microbial activities, such as ammonification, nitrification, denitrification, and formation of microbial biomass. Denitrification is expected to be of minor relevance due to the <b>aerobic</b> <b>test</b> conditions. Sieved soil is supplemented with powdered plant meal (e.g., lucerne meal). According to the OECD test guideline, for non-agrochemicals, the nitrate concentrations in treated and control samples are measured {{at the start of the}} test and after incubation for 28 days; for agrochemicals additional sampling points are requested. We applied this test to two silver nanomaterials and the soluble silver salt AgNO 3, and by considering only the start and end point, we found no evidence of toxicity towards soil-nitrifying bacteria. However, the same concentrations of test materials showed clear concentration-effect curves in the carbon transformation test (substrate-induced respiration) [3]. For strongly biocidal compounds, dose-related inhibition of substrate-induced respiration combined with a stimulated N-mineralization is typical [19]. In the following chapters, we discuss/consider the unusual sensitivity of both test systems (effects in C-transformation test; no effect in N-transformation test) when investigating Ag-NM and soluble AgNO 3.|$|E

40|$|Although {{soccer and}} futsal are sports with similar motor actions, the {{differences}} in size and match dynamics result in distinct physiological requirements. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate and compare parameters of aerobic capacity between professional soccer and futsal athletes. A total of 553 ergospirometric evaluations were performed: 367 soccer players (32 goalkeepers, 335 on-court players) and 186 futsal athletes (22 goalkeepers, 164 on-court players). The results were analyzed separately for each modality (comparison between goalkeepers and on-court players) and compared between soccer and futsal athletes. Soccer and futsal goalkeepers presented lower maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2 max), second ventilatory threshold (VT 2), and speed to reach these thresholds than on-court players of the respective modalities. Soccer goalkeepers were superior in terms of these parameters when compared to futsal goalkeepers. No differences in VO 2 max or VT 2 were observed between soccer and futsal on-court players, although soccer athletes reached the thresholds at higher speeds. In conclusion, soccer and futsal goalkeepers present lower aerobic capacity than on-court players. Soccer players show better performance in <b>aerobic</b> <b>tests</b> than futsal athlete...|$|R
