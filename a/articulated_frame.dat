5000|$|A large {{increase}} in firebox area (from 66 sq ft on the H-10 to 100 sq ft on the A-1), characteristic of his work, necessitated adding another axle to the trailing truck, thus creating the 2-8-4 wheel arrangement. Built {{in the spring}} of 1925, the first Berkshire (a demonstrator owned by Lima) was dubbed the A-1. In addition to supporting the very large firebox and grate, the four-wheeled trailing truck carried the ash pan. For this purpose, the truck was redesigned as an articulated extension of the locomotive frame. The result was an ash pan which could hold more ash, allowing the locomotive to travel farther between cleanings. (For roads which burned coal, this was a significant innovation. But it was not without tradeoffs. The <b>articulated</b> <b>frame</b> reduced weight on the driving wheels, which did not aid tractive effort (pulling ability). The locomotives so configured also had more difficulty staying on the rails in reverse, particularly through yard trackwork like switch frogs.) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{sliding contact}} between {{pantograph}} and catenary {{is used to}} collect the current fed by the electrical trains for running. A good quality of current collection, i. e. a sliding contact with a low percentage of contact losses, is then essential to assure the regular run of the electrical railway vehicles. In some cases, multiple pantographs to collect current for a railway vehicle are used: this configuration represents a critical condition, even to relatively low vehicle speeds, due to the dynamic interaction among the contact wire motion produced by the first pantograph passage and the trailing pantographs that are subject to an high probability of contact loss between the collector strip and the contact wire. This paper deals with an active control acting on the <b>articulated</b> <b>frame</b> of a pantograph by means of its pneumatic spring in order to study {{the effect on the}} current collection quality, when a double pantograph configuration with a close distance is used. Experimental tests aimed at the definition of the transfer function between the air pressure of the pneumatic spring acting on the <b>articulated</b> <b>frame,</b> and the contact force have been carried out in order to define the possibility to use the air spring as actuator for control at low frequency. Finally the numerical simulation of two pantographs in standard configuration and with the application of active control has been performed to preliminarily verify the advantages on the current collection quality...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Motion {{planning}} {{is a necessary}} step before automation in road con-struction. This paper deals with motion planning for compactors. The compactor is an <b>articulated</b> <b>frame</b> steering vehicle used in road construction. Generally, motion planning uses the kinematic model of the robot. In {{the case of the}} compactor, this model is far away from reality because it {{does not take into account}} compactor masses and particular drum-soil contact forces. A motion planning which uses both the kinematic and the dynamic model of the compactor is presented in this paper. The advantages of this motion planning are: • To generate feasible motion for the robot which implies a smoother control law for mechanics, • Limited slips...|$|E

40|$|Pantograph-catenary {{interaction}} {{is one of}} the most important items for operation of high speed trains, reliable current collection being the necessary pre-condition to speed up trains. Severe limitations can come from the variability of the contact force acting between the pantograph and the catenary, which can lead to poor current collection or excessive wear of both contact wire and collector strips. This paper describes a pneumatic actively controlled pantograph which exploits the air spring located at the base of the <b>articulated</b> <b>frame</b> as actuator, in order to reduce contact force variability. The control strategy adopted is the Optimal Control (LQR – Linear Quadratic Regulator) based on a Finite Time approach.

40|$|The {{classical}} mathematical {{models and}} the corresponding multibody programs are not always adapted to the increasing diversity of railway bogie designs, since the most general envisaged case consists of a carbody (or several) carried by two rigid bogies equipped with wheelsets. Although the latter configuration still represents the {{major part of the}} railway vehicles in use, new concepts in the design of bogies (independent wheels, <b>articulated</b> <b>frame,</b> pneumatic suspensions, [...] .) have a relatively poor scientific background with respect to the know-how gained in the domain of conventional vehicle : this justifies the development of more general mathematical modelling and computer programs, able to generate a reliable model in a relatively short time. The multibody program ROBOTRAN has been developed in that sense, offering the possibility to obtain the models of a family of railway vehicles - conventional or not - from a symbolic library of carbodies and bogies. The present paper illustates this through a comparison of behaviour between three bogies in a same situation :the entry curving at constant speed...|$|E

40|$|This thesis report contends {{with the}} {{contemporary}} context of studio craft {{here in the}} USA. Studio craft is predicated on habits of a modern world, and {{the political and economic}} relations comprising our social landscape have left the viability of those habits behind. The framework of studio craft, i. e. the politics that form its enactment, is necessarily shifting with the pressures of the environment. This project identifies this shift as an opportunity to recognize and intervene in these politics, and thus craft's reproductive power. This report focuses particularly on craft's process of political reproduction as an ideological one, and thus an enabler of the status relations of its contemporary place. In addition, as an ideological process, whether they win or lose in the status reproduction game craft's participants are left unable to account for the relations they promulgate. This report identifies the characteristics of craft's modernist mode, including the dysfunctions buried in the practice of its forms. The report <b>articulates</b> <b>frames</b> for the shifting contemporary landscape that impose new pressures on craft. The report then moves toward modes of intervention in the political landscape that craft both is produced by and reproduces. The field of craft is conventionally assumed as an object moving on its own terms through the world. This report finds instead the field of craft to be an activity, i. e. the sharing of sensibilities which enable action, and those sensibilities to be rooted in the political economic relations of its location. The force of this report then, in interventional terms, is to locate craft's material effects within the site of those relations. Here we can account, and thus take responsibility, for the habits of craft's enactment.   M. F. A...|$|R

40|$|Improving energy efficiency, productivity, safety, {{and comfort}} of mobile {{machines}} {{is of utmost}} priority to original equipment manufacturers, suppliers, and consumers given the escalating fuel prices and increased awareness {{to the environment and}} workplace hazards. A major breakthrough in the realm of high power motion control is pump displacement controlled (DC) actuation, which does away with hydraulic valves for motion control and uses a variable displacement pump as both a flow source and final control element, thus eliminating throttling losses associated with hydraulic control valves. This work deals with researching and implementing DC technology for realizing the steering function of <b>articulated</b> <b>frame</b> steering mobile machines; however, the technology can be easily adapted to accommodate other applications and industries (aerospace, automotive, commercial, etc.) as well. ^ To realize the new steering technology, high fidelity dynamic models of the entire system including the electro-hydraulics and vehicle dynamics are first derived. Two controllers, linear and nonlinear (adaptive), are designed and validated in simulation and experimentally. System sizing and hardware implementation are then completed on a representative prototype test vehicle. Experimental testing results of a steering-only cycle performed on a compact wheel loader reveal a substantial improvement over the baseline machine in regards to fuel consumption reduction (- 14. 5...|$|E
40|$|The {{ride and}} {{directional}} stability properties of an <b>articulated</b> <b>frame</b> steer vehicle (ASV) are investigated through formulation {{of a comprehensive}} three-dimensional vehicle model. The model integrates a kineto-dynamic formulation of the frame steering system, a torsio-elastic rear axle suspension, and random roughness of two parallel terrain tracks. The validity of the model is illustrated {{on the basis of}} the field-measured ride vibration data and steering strut responses to a 90 -degree-turn manoeuvre. The model is applied to determine the ride and yaw/roll dynamic responses of an articulated dump truck with and without a rear-axle suspension under steady and transient steering inputs. The ride responses are evaluated in terms of weighted and un-weighted rms accelerations at the operator location, while the directional responses are obtained in terms of static and dynamic rollover thresholds, rearward amplification ratio, and critical speed corresponding to snaking instability. The results suggest that the rear-axle torsio-elastic suspension yields slightly lower yaw and roll stability limit of the vehicle but substantial reductions in the ride vibration levels. Tyre interactions with the rough terrains affect the stability limits in a highly adverse manner. The results suggest that suspension design with greater lateral and torsional stiffness could yield enhanced directional stability limits while preserving the ride performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the contact forces exchanged between pantograph and catenary (OverHead Line, OHL), together with the contact loss condition, {{is a very important}} mean to assess the overall performance of current collection. From the {{knowledge of}} the contact force it is possible to assess the dynamic performance of the pantograph-OHL system, moreover it can be possible perform diagnostic activities on the OHL.
