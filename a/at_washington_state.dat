In 2004, Leaf resumed his education <b>at</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>State</b> University and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in humanities in May 2005. The San Diego Union-Tribune reported that among his classes in the spring 2005 was a sports management course titled Media Relations.|$|E
5|$|After his NFL career ended, Leaf {{completed}} his degree <b>at</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>State.</b> He would later have legal troubles involving drugs beginning in 2010, after a Texas judge {{sentenced him to}} 10 years probation. Two years later, Leaf pleaded guilty to felony burglary and drug possession in Montana. After a suspended sentence with a stint in drug rehabilitation, Leaf began serving a seven-year sentence in state prison in December 2012. In 2014, Leaf was sentenced {{to five years in}} prison for breaking into a home in Montana to steal prescription drugs, which violated his Texas probation. He was released from prison on December 3, 2014.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, an Italian-led {{consortium}} {{announced they}} had sequenced the complete genome {{of the apple}} in collaboration with horticultural genomicists <b>at</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>State</b> University, using 'Golden Delicious'. It had about 57,000 genes, {{the highest number of}} any plant genome studied to date and more genes than the human genome (about 30,000). This new understanding of the apple genome will help scientists in identifying genes and gene variants that contribute to resistance to disease and drought, and other desirable characteristics. Understanding the genes behind these characteristics will allow scientists to perform more knowledgeable selective breeding. The genome sequence also provided proof that Malus sieversii was the wild ancestor of the domestic apple—an issue that had been long-debated in the scientific community.|$|E

5|$|Oregon {{then began}} a 10-game winning streak, their longest {{since the start}} of the 1937–38 season. Oregon State was the Webfoots' first {{opponent}} during the streak, on January 13; Oregon prevailed 31–26. In two higher-scoring contests <b>at</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>State</b> on January 17 and 18, the Webfoots claimed 56–44 and 57–31 victories, respectively. A five-game road trip concluded with games in Idaho on January 20 and 21. The contests were closer than those against Washington State, but the Webfoots won 38–30 in the first game and 35–31 in the second to improve to 6–1 in conference play. Oregon's next five games were at home, beginning with a second encounter against Oregon State, on January 27 that they won by a seven-point margin. Washington traveled to Oregon for games on January 31 and February 1, and 57–49 and 58–42 victories moved the Webfoots' winning streak to eight. They then concluded their four-game season series with Idaho, winning by 17 points in each game. On February 18, the Webfoots' streak ended with a 50–31 upset loss to Oregon State, which would be their last of the season. Six days later, Oregon posted a 48–37 win over the Beavers at home. That game was the Webfoots' last appearance for the 1938–39 regular season at McArthur Court; it was the school's 100th win at the arena since it was opened in 1927.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{research}} <b>at</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>State</b> University indicates that, {{in addition}} to many other herding breeds, approximately 15% of the English Shepherd population {{is subject to the}} MDR1 gene mutation. Dogs that are tested positive have increased sensitivity and adverse reactions to a number of common canine drugs. A simple cheek swab is all that is needed to test if the dog has this potentially life-threatening condition.|$|E
25|$|According to the College of Veterinary Medicine <b>at</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>State</b> University, the Shetland Sheepdog, {{and many}} other herding breeds, have a risk of being born with a MDR1 Gene Mutation, with about 15% of {{individuals}} affected. Cross-breeds are also affected. Dogs carrying Mdr1-1 share a common ancestor that experienced remarkable evolutionary success, having contributed genetically to at least nine distinct breeds of dog. Due to this genetic mutation, affected dogs may exhibit sensitivity or adverse reactions to many drugs, including Acepromazine, Butorphanol, Doxorubicin, Erythromycin, Ivermectin, Loperamide, Milbemycin, Moxidectin, Rifampin, Selamectin, Vinblastine, and Vincristine.|$|E

Frutig was credited with developing Ed Barker, Washington State's end who broke two Coast Conference pass-catching records in 1951. He resigned in December 1951 {{to take a job}} with an advertising firm in East Lansing, Michigan and went on to become successful in the advertising business. In 1967, Frutig and Bob Westfall were the leaders of the Alumni for Evy Committee, organized to bring Evashevski to Michigan as both head football coach and athletic director. Instead, Bo Schembechler and Don Canham were hired to the jobs.|$|E
25|$|At UCLA, Kaczmarski {{started at}} point guard early in the 1999-2000 season due to an injury to regular starter Erica Gomez. Eventually, she was shifted to the {{shooting}} guard position.

She improved later in the season, ending {{with an average of}} 11.7 points per game and having set a school record by hitting seven three pointers during a game <b>at</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>State</b> University. Kaczmarski was also named Pac-10 Player of the Week during the final week of the regular season and was a selection to the conference all-freshman team.|$|E

25|$|Jackson {{began his}} career as a {{broadcaster}} <b>at</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>State</b> in 1952, when he called on radio a game between Stanford and Washington State. He then worked for KOMO radio in Seattle, and later for KOMO-TV from 1954 to 1964 as co-anchor for their first news team (first co-anchor news team on the West Coast) covering Seafair hydroplane races, minor league Seattle Rainiers baseball games, and University of Washington football games. In 1958, Jackson became the first American sports announcer to broadcast an event from the Soviet Union, a crew race between the Washington Huskies and a Soviet team. Despite heavy suspicion and numerous hurdles by the Soviet authorities, Jackson and his cohorts were able to cover the race: the first ever American sports victory on Russian soil.|$|E
25|$|Scarry, {{who coached}} the {{basketball}} team at Western Reserve University in Cleveland during his playing career, retired from pro football after the 1947 season {{to take up a}} post as head coach of the school's football team. He stayed there for two seasons before moving to Santa Clara University in California as an assistant coach. Scarry then moved in 1952 to Loras College in Iowa as an assistant. After a stint <b>at</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>State</b> University, he spent six years as the line coach for the University of Cincinnati. Scarry served as head football coach at Waynesburg, his alma mater, for three seasons between 1963 and 1965. He got his first professional coaching job in 1966 with the NFL's Washington Redskins, the following year, and became the defensive line coach of the Miami Dolphins three years later. He stayed with the Dolphins for 15 seasons until his retirement; during his Dolphins career, the team won two Super Bowls. Scarry was inducted into the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame in 2000.|$|E
25|$|The team {{returned}} home to play Lewis-Clark State on November 29. They routed the Warriors 104–57, and were led by freshman Kyle Dranginis, who had a career-high 30 points, seven assists, and six rebounds. Despite sitting starters Harris and Bell, the Zags forced 20 turnovers and had a 46–20 rebounding advantage. In the teams' first meeting since 1976, the Bulldogs defeated Pacific 85–67 two days later. Despite an early 18–10 Pacific lead, Gonzaga replied with a 10–0 run later {{in the first half}} to take a 49–34 halftime lead. The frontcourt accounted for 64 of the team's points, as bench player Sam Dower scored 18 points and grabbed nine rebounds. After this, the Zags faced their first true road game of the season as they travelled to play <b>at</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>State.</b> Down 67–69, DaVonte Lacy made a layup for the Cougars to tie the game. With the game tied at 69, Pangos drove up the court to make a layup with two seconds left to secure the 71–69 victory. Olynyk made 10 of 14 shots and grabbed seven rebounds to keep Gonzaga in the game in the second half, while Harris led the team with 23 points. The victory gave the Bulldogs their best start to a season in Division I history with a 9–0 record.|$|E
