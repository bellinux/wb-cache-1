She made several films for Shaw Brothers Studio, a successor company of Tianyi, and her performance in Li Han-hsiang's Rear Door (Houmen) won her the Best Actress Award at the Seventh Asian Film Festival held in Tokyo in 1960. It also won the Best Film Award.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>older</b> {{generation}} of Waffen-SS scribes has died off, a new, post-war cadre of writers has {{done much to}} perpetuate {{the image of the}} force as a revolutionary European army.

Several actors from The Lord of the Rings, including Ian McKellen, Andy Serkis, Hugo Weaving, Elijah Wood, Ian Holm (<b>as</b> <b>older</b> Bilbo), Christopher Lee, Cate Blanchett and Orlando Bloom reprised their roles.|$|E
5|$|The {{membership}} decline {{continued in}} the late 1960s and early 1970s, <b>as</b> <b>older</b> congregants died and moved away, and dwindled {{to the point where}} the congregation could no longer afford to heat the sanctuary, and thought they would have to disband. Nevertheless, in 1972 the congregation established a nursery school and prozdor (high school).|$|E
5|$|As calcium {{is heavily}} {{involved}} in bone manufacture, many bone diseases {{can be traced to}} problems with the organic matrix or the hydroxyapatite in molecular structure or organisation. For example, osteoporosis is a reduction in mineral content of bone per unit volume, and can be treated by supplementation of calcium, vitamin D, and biphosphates. Calcium supplements may benefit the serum lipids in women who have passed menopause as well <b>as</b> <b>older</b> men; in post-menopausal women calcium supplementation also appears to be inversely correlated with cardiovascular disease. Inadequate amounts of calcium, vitamin D, or phosphates can lead to the softening of bones, known as osteomalacia.|$|E

5|$|As of 2007, the {{following}} reviews are underway: {{a review of}} past records of Macaronesian shearwaters, reviews of all redhead and royal tern records, a review of great white egrets to establish if any are of the Nearctic race, a review of sandplovers, a review of records of the eastern race of redstart, a review of Orphean warbler records aimed at determining the race of each, and a review of subalpine warblers to determine which individuals are ascribable to the race albistriata. It has also been suggested that reviews should be conducted of records of great snipe, <b>as</b> <b>older</b> records show a very different temporal occurrence pattern than more recent birds, {{the large numbers of}} gull-billed tern records from the English south coast from the 1960s, and desert wheatears, to establish racial identifications.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>older</b> {{problems}} are solved, more complexities are being introduced, like adding additional parts to an engine. Interaction {{of these new}} parts, or niches, create emergent properties, like time-saving office devices (e.g. email, mobile computers, etc.) make communication more efficient but also expand the network of contacts and {{increase the amount of}} time spent on such duties. Homer-Dixon relates this to complexity theory explaining that as new niches are filled there is a synergistic burst of simplicity. However, this can also lead to less control or freedom as emergent properties are created, like a new government program leading to a sprawling bureaucracy. Information theory is touched upon relating the amount of information required to describe a system and the degree of that system's complexity. Chaos theory is used to describe how small changes can lead to widely varying results and path dependence.|$|E

5|$|Hi-5 {{were formed}} in 1998 in Sydney, Australia as a children's musical group. Television {{producer}} Helena Harris, {{who had worked}} on Bananas in Pyjamas, co-created Hi-5 as a concept for a new television show. She and co-producer Posie Graeme-Evans (The Miraculous Mellops, Mirror, Mirror) developed the series as preschool entertainment, incorporating educational trends with a pop music appeal, using music and movement to capture the attention of children. Featuring five performers, the cast are intended to act <b>as</b> <b>older</b> siblings of viewers, rather than adults teaching children. The name of the group {{was derived from the}} high five gesture.|$|E
5|$|House sparrows can {{breed in}} the {{breeding}} season immediately following their hatching, and sometimes {{attempt to do}} so. Some birds breeding {{for the first time}} in tropical areas are only a few months old and still have juvenile plumage. Birds breeding for the first time are rarely successful in raising young, and reproductive success increases with age, <b>as</b> <b>older</b> birds breed earlier in the breeding season, and fledge more young. As the breeding season approaches, hormone releases trigger enormous increases in the size of the sexual organs and changes in day length lead males to start calling by nesting sites. The timing of mating and egg-laying varies geographically, and between specific locations and years because a sufficient supply of insects is needed for egg formation and feeding nestlings.|$|E
5|$|The Romney Literary Society reorganized on May 15, 1869. Following the reorganization, {{the society}} built Literary Hall between 1869 and 1870 while also {{undertaking}} an initiative {{to bring the}} West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind to its old Romney Classical Institute campus. The construction of Literary Hall {{was part of the}} society's effort to revive the organization and reassemble its original library. The society set about recovering original volumes and purchasing new ones, and the library reopened with 700 volumes. For a period of ten years between 1870 and 1880, much of Romney's intellectual life centered on Literary Hall. <b>As</b> <b>older</b> members died, interest in the society began to dwindle. The society's meetings were held less frequently, and its last recorded meeting was held on February 15, 1886.|$|E

5|$|With the {{increase}} of tea's use in Chinese herbology, production methods changed, where the processed green tea leaves were not immediately dried after steaming. Rather the steamed tea leaves were first pulverized into a paste form, with the paste then formed in moulds and slowly dried into brick tea, a technique well described by Lu Yu in his work The Classic of Tea. Tender leaves and leaf buds were generally not used, <b>as</b> <b>older</b> mature tea leaves were preferred for tea production. Some tea bricks were also produced from mature whole leaves, which typically required {{the use of a}} cooked rice slurry (米湯) to bind the tea brick together. The preference of producing tea in brick form possibly {{stems from the fact that}} it can be more easily transported and stored.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, {{mainframe}} {{computers and}} minicomputers were present in many academic research institutions and large companies such as Bell Labs. While the commercial video game industry did not yet exist at that point in the early history of video games and would not until the early 1970s, programmers at these companies created several small games to be played on their mainframe computers. Most of these spread only to other users of the same type of computer and therefore did not persist <b>as</b> <b>older</b> computer models were discontinued; several, however, inspired future games, or were later released in modified versions on more modern systems or languages. These early mainframe games were largely created between 1968 and 1971; while earlier games were created they were limited to small, academic audiences. Mainframe games also continued to be developed through the 1970s, but the rise of the commercial video game industry, focused on arcade video games and home video game consoles, followed by the rise of personal computers later in the decade, meant that beginning in the 1970s the audience and developers of video games began to shift away from mainframe computers or minicomputers, and the spread of general-purpose programming languages such as the BASIC programming language meant that later mainframe games could generally be run on personal computers with minimal changes, even if initially developed on a mainframe.|$|E

5|$|In August 1939, Ljotić's cousin, Milan Nedić, was {{appointed}} Yugoslav Minister of Defense. Later that year, almost all Zbor publications, including Otadžbina, Buđenje, Zbor, Naš put (Our Path) and Vihor (Whirlwind), were prohibited. Ljotić exploited the connections {{he had with}} Nedić {{to ensure that the}} banned Zbor-published journal Bilten (Bulletin) was distributed to members of the Royal Yugoslav Army. The journal was published illegally in a military printing house and distributed throughout the country by military couriers. Ljotić was the journal's main contributor and editor-in-chief. Fifty-eight issues of Bilten were published from March 1939 until October 1940, in which Ljotić advocated a pro-Axis Yugoslav foreign policy and criticized Belgrade's tolerance of Jews. As many as 20,000 copies each were printed of later issues of the journal. Ljotić was particularly pleased with being able to exert his ideological influence over young military academy trainees as well <b>as</b> <b>older</b> officers.|$|E
5|$|Mainframe {{computers}} are computers used primarily by businesses and academic institutions for large-scale processes. Before personal computers, first termed microcomputers, became widely {{available to the}} general public in the 1970s, the computing industry was composed of mainframe computers and the relatively smaller and cheaper minicomputer variant. During the mid to late 1960s, many early video games were programmed on these computers. Developed prior to the rise of the commercial video game industry in the early 1970s, these early mainframe games were generally written by students or employees at large corporations in a machine or assembly language that could only be understood by the specific machine or computer type they were developed on. While many of these games were lost <b>as</b> <b>older</b> computers were discontinued, some of them were ported to high-level computer languages like BASIC, had expanded versions later released for personal computers, or were recreated for bulletin board systems years later, thus influencing future games and developers.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} buildings {{took some}} time to finish; only the original gateway was lavished upon from the beginning. The buildings were only of a modest splendour: the hall was not completed {{until the end of}} the seventeenth century; the rooms economically decorated without wood panelling; the main quadrangle only of one storey and garrets. Although an earlier chapel is suspected, the area above Staircase I– now the Senior Common Room– was in use by 1521. It appears that the ecclesiastical furnishings promised by Smyth never arrived, and have been presumed taken by the College's first Visitor, Cardinal Wolsey. Although the chapel (or perhaps oratory) was plain, two chalices and two patens survived from the original three of each and have been identified <b>as</b> <b>older</b> than those of Corpus or Trinity, dating to the late fifteenth century. Similarly the Old Library, now staircase IV, room 4, was completed in 1520–1, was not intended to be permanent but kept a considerable collection of books, most attained from benefactors, of which the most valuable were those donated by Henry Mason during the reign of James I. The library remained in that location until 1663.|$|E
