50|$|That's My Bush! was a {{short-lived}} live-action political satire/sitcom from South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. It aired on Comedy Central in first run from April through June 2001. Despite being about the fictional exploits of the president, it instead mostly satirized 1970s, 1980s, and workplace sitcoms; indeed, {{it was originally}} pitched as being about Al Gore, implying that jokes <b>about</b> <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> were never really meant to be the show's main feature. The show often portrayed Bush dealing with both a sitcom-type situation and a political one at the same time, such as having a romantic dinner with Laura the same night as a major dinner with {{both sides of the}} abortion debate. George W. Bush was generally portrayed as being somewhat dim (as were most of the characters) yet essentially sincere in his efforts. The show was eventually canceled due to high production costs and insufficient ratings.After the attacks of September 11, Comedy Central stopped showing reruns of the show. The complete series was released on DVD in 2006.|$|E

5000|$|The 50th CMA Awards {{attracted}} {{a large amount}} of media attention for both the return of the Dixie Chicks to the CMA stage following their controversial statements <b>about</b> <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> which saw them shut out of the country music industry as well as the appearance of Beyoncé. Their performance of [...] "Daddy Lessons" [...] from Beyoncé's Lemonade album polarised viewers, artists and critics alike, with some praising the collaboration and others denouncing the performance, stating that Beyoncé (a pop/R&B artist) had no place at a country music awards show. Many saw the criticisms as retaliation to an outspoken woman of color standing alongside three equally strong independent women on the stage of an award show notorious for its conservative attitudes and lack of diversity, with several reviewers noting that many of the negative comments surrounding Beyoncé's inclusion at the ceremony as hateful and racist, pointing {{to the fact that there}} was not backlash on such a scale when Meghan Trainor performed with Miranda Lambert, Ariana Grande performed with Little Big Town or when Justin Timberlake performed with Chris Stapleton at previous CMA ceremonies, with several in fact referring to the latter as one of the best CMA performances of all time. Many also took issue with Beyoncé being allegedly [...] "anti-police" [...] and branded the Dixie Chicks as [...] "anti-American".|$|E
5000|$|Not-About-AIDS-Dance is {{the dance}} that Greenberg is most readily {{identified}} with. Premiered in 1994, {{the year that}} AIDS became {{the leading cause of}} death for Americans between the ages of 25-44, as well as the year that Greenberg lost eight of his friends as well as his older brother to AIDS. Greenberg has said that the enigmatic title has to do with his brother, Jon Greenberg, an AIDS activist, who [...] "didn't want his death to be <b>about</b> <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> or Bill Clinton or even AIDS". In N-A-A-D, Greenberg continues his use of text projections, the projections revealing intimate facts about the dancers onstage. One such fact that is revealed is Greenberg's own HIV status, which he had not previously publicly disclosed. Dance critic Randy Gener wrote that N-A-A-D is an [...] "immortality-project" [...] reference to one of the projections in the dance about a dance in progress- about the haphazard ways the evolution of a piece is disrupted by cruel facts in the universe, about how the road to creation is rife with bumps, digressions, flashbacks, and stark signposts, of which AIDS is one of the most horrifying". The dance has been referenced alongside Bill T. Jones's landmark dance Still/Here, which premiered 6 months after [...] "N-A-A-D."

40|$|This article explores two {{hypotheses}} about how voters encounter information during campaigns. According to the anticipated agreement hypothesis, people prefer {{to hear about}} candidates with whom they expect to agree. The ‘‘issue publics’ ’ hypothesis posits that voters choose to encounter information on issues they consider most important personally. We tested both hypotheses by distributing a multimedia CD offering extensive information about George W. Bush and Al Gore to {{a representative sample of}} registered voters with personal computers and home Internet connections during the closing weeks of the 2000 campaign. Exposure to information was measured by tracking individuals ’ use of the CD. The evidence provided strong support for the issue public hypothesis and partial support for the anticipated agreement hypothesis. Republicans and conservatives preferred to access information <b>about</b> <b>George</b> <b>Bush,</b> but Democrats and liberals did not prefer information about Vice President Gore. No interactions appeared between these two forms of selective exposure. Classical theories of democracy presume that citizensarereasonablywellinformedaboutpublic affairs. Revisionist accounts, while acknowledging that most citizens fall short of the democratic ideal, still presume some minimal level of exposure to political information. The question of just how much exposure occurs is relevant {{to a wide range of}} scholarship exploring everything from the impact of campaigns on voters ’ level of knowledge about the candidates (see, fo...|$|E
40|$|The {{mention that}} he was an {{exercise}} enthusiast seemed to imply that his exercise had failed to prevent him from having the need for a stent. I also was a little surprised about the stent since I remember that George Bush had been a regular avid runner during his presidency. He ran regular 8 -minute miles, which impressed me. I like to jog and am a couple of years younger than George Bush {{but there was no way}} that I could keep up his pace. Although I disagreed with most of his political policies, I could admire his personal dedication to exercise. It is always a bit of a shock to hear of someone who exercises regularly having heart troubles. So, why exercise? I know enough about atherosclerosis to know that it is an insidious disease often without symptoms. Most coronary atherosclerosis even when severely advanced often has few symptoms. It is often missed on routine screening treadmill stress tests and even with coronary angiography the extent of the disease can be underestimated. Also, there is a strong component of genetics in coronary atherosclerosis and it is definitely more common as we age. Is it inevitable if we live long enough?
