500|$|The {{episode is}} set on December 27, 2004, the survivors' 97th day on the island. [...] At the beach camp, the corpse of Ray (Marc Vann), the {{freighter}} Kahana doctor, washes ashore. [...] Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies) calls the freighter and asks what happened to Ray via morse code. [...] Daniel lies about the response, saying that rescue helicopters will be sent soon; however, Bernard Nadler (Sam Anderson) calls him on this and correctly interprets the freighter's message: [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> about? The doctor is fine." [...] Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), who suffers from stomach pains throughout the day, forces Daniel to reveal that it was never their intention to rescue the survivors.|$|E
500|$|It was teasingly {{suggested}} that Isaacs prove {{his devotion to}} Kermode and Mayo's Film Review by having his character say [...] "ukulele" [...] onscreen, which {{was a case of}} [...] "Challenge accepted!" [...] The line, [...] "He's not going to be playing the ukulele in heaven", was uttered, while examining a corpse whose fingers had been badly mangled. [...] "When I did that I got a note from the editing room going, 'What the f— <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> about?'" [...] says the actor. [...] "I said, 'You have to keep the line in. If I can ever wield my big stick as a producer, I'm telling you I want the ukulele line left in!'" [...] The line was kept in the episode.|$|E
500|$|Darren {{came in for}} casting {{and began}} talking about knowing where to source the {{appropriate}} tuxedos, {{and that he could}} wear a pair of Dean Martin's shoes that he owned. During the course of the meeting, Behr became convinced that Darren was performing the Fontaine piece, having moved into it seamlessly. Darren had deliberately avoiding simply reading the script, as he disliked doing cold reads; instead, he had intentionally improvising things that he felt that the character would say. After Darren left, Behr excitedly told the other writers how good he was, but that perhaps they should still see other actors. Producer Hans Beimler replied, [...] "Are you out of your mind? What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> about? Vic Fontaine was just in the room. There's no question, there's no question! He's the guy!" ...|$|E

500|$|There {{are many}} {{unconfirmed}} stories about Henderson. A Padres teammate (variously reported as Steve Finley or Tony Gwynn) once {{offered him a}} seat anywhere on the bus, saying that Henderson had tenure. Henderson supposedly replied, [...] "Ten years? What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> about? Rickey got 16, 17 years." [...] One widely reported story was a fabrication that began as a clubhouse joke made by a visiting player. While playing for Seattle in 2000, Henderson {{was said to have}} commented on first baseman John Olerud's practice of wearing a batting helmet while playing defense, noting that a former teammate in Toronto did the same thing. Olerud was reported to have replied, [...] "That was me." [...] The two men had been together the previous season with the 1999 Mets, {{as well as with the}} 1993 World Champion Blue Jays. Several news outlets originally reported the story as fact.|$|E
500|$|Snyder's {{first cut}} of the film was three hours long. In keeping the film tight, Snyder dubbed himself [...] "the gatekeeper" [...] of the comic's easter eggs, [...] "while [...] conspire to say, 'No. Length, length, length. Playability.' [...] I've lost {{perspective}} on that now, because to me, the honest truth is I geek out on little stuff now as much as anybody. Like, people will go, 'We've got to cut. You don't need that shot of Hollis Mason's garage sign.' And I'm like, 'What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> about? Of course you do. Are you crazy? How will people enjoy the movie without shit like that in it?' So it's hard for me." [...] Snyder cut the film down to 162 minutes when he realized {{there was a way}} to further trim the film: removing the murder of Hollis Mason, the first Nite Owl, which [...] "was easy without destroying the movie".|$|E
500|$|Both Kanye West and Carlos Mencia responded {{within one}} day of the episode's {{original}} broadcast and said they enjoyed the parodies of themselves, although Kanye West said on his blog that his feelings were hurt. [...] After the episode was broadcast, Mencia wrote on his Twitter feed, [...] "They just made fun of me on South Park. I thought it was hysterical. Catch the rerun." [...] Dave Itzkoff, arts reporter for The New York Times, complimented Mencia for his response. West wrote on his blog, [...] "South Park murdered me last night and it's pretty damn funny. It hurts my feelings but what can you expect from South Park!" [...] West thanked the South Park writers in his blog entry and acknowledged {{he has a problem}} with his ego, but said he was trying to change. Parker and Stone said they were extremely surprised by West's reaction, and felt Mencia was treated far more harshly in the episode than West. Parker said, [...] "It was like, dude, we just said you were a gay fish. What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> about? It was so dumb." ...|$|E

500|$|Since Mrs. Voorhees, {{the killer}} in the {{original}} Friday the 13th, does not show up until the final reel of the film, Manfredini had the job of creating a score that would represent the killer in her absence. Manfredini {{was inspired by the}} 1975 film Jaws, where the shark is not seen {{for the majority of the}} film, but the motif created by John Williams cued the audience as to when the shark was present during scenes and unseen. While listening to a piece of Krzysztof Penderecki music, which contained a chorus with [...] "striking pronunciations", Manfredini was inspired to recreate a similar sound for Friday the 13th. He came up with the sound [...] "ki ki ki, ma ma ma", based on the line [...] "Kill her mommy!", which Mrs. Voorhees recites repeatedly in the final reel. The [...] "ki" [...] comes from [...] "kill", and the [...] "ma" [...] from [...] "mommy". To achieve the unique sound he wanted for the film, Manfredini spoke the two words [...] "harshly, distinctly, and rhythmically into a microphone" [...] and ran them into an echo reverberation machine. Manfredini finished the original score after a few weeks and recorded it in a friend's basement. Victor Miller and assistant editor Jay Keuper have commented on how memorable the music is, with Keuper describing it as [...] "iconographic". Manfredini makes note of the mispronunciation of the sounds: [...] "Everybody thinks it's cha, cha, cha. I'm like, 'Cha, cha, cha'? What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> about?" ...|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{wrote that}} the ending from this episode [...] "did have a season finale feel to it with the big musical number. [...] Still, {{it was a great}} season, and I loved going out with two of the best characters on TV summing up the moment perfectly – Liz: 'We sure had quite a year.' Jack: 'What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> about? It's May.'" [...] Canning gave it an 8.5 out of 10 rating. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger {{wrote that the}} [...] "all-star cast of musicians" [...] featured were not able to dominate the episode [...] "to the point where the episode didn't work." [...] Sepinwall, however, added that despite [...] "Kidney Now!" [...] not being a classic 30 Rock episode [...] "it was [...] funny enough – which, I suppose, also makes it an appropriate finale for this uneven season." [...] Further in the review, Sepinwall was complimentary towards Liz's plot, writing that the character's sequence on The Vontella Show was [...] "hilarious, and a fine demonstration of how much confidence Tina Fey has gained as an actress over the years." [...] The A.V. Club’s Nathan Rabin also enjoyed the Liz character, reporting that she [...] "delivered a virtuoso performance in , instantly homing in on the fatal flaw in every relationship and obliterating it with highly quotable sass." [...] In discussion to Tracy's plot, Rabin opined it was the [...] "weakest of the various threads" [...] in this episode. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad confessed in his recap {{that he was going to}} summarize [...] "Kidney Now!" [...] as [...] "a little disappointing, but then I hit rewind on my DVR and watched it again and realized, wow, they actually hit all of the season finale notes rather perfectly [...] This episode was quite funny." ...|$|E

Hours later, Wayne State University in Detroit discontinued the Helen Thomas Spirit of Diversity in Media Award, which it had been granting {{for more than ten}} years, citing what it called her anti-Semitic remarks. Thomas objected, saying that [...] "the leaders of Wayne State University have made a mockery of the First Amendment and disgraced their understanding of its inherent freedom of speech and the press."

2500|$|Both leaders, Massoud and Haq, were {{recognized}} for being fiercely independent from foreign, especially Pakistani, influence. Both, {{two of the}} most successful anti-Soviet resistance leaders, were rejecting the Pakistani claim of hegemony over the Afghan mujahideen. Abdul Haq was quoted as saying during the anti-Soviet period: [...] "How is that we Afghans, who never lost a war, must take military instructions from the Pakistanis, who never won one?" [...] Massoud during the Soviet period said to the Pakistani Foreign Minister who had asked him {{to send a message to}} the Russians through the Pakistanis who were conducting talks [...] "on behalf of our Afghan brethren": [...] "Why should I send a message? Why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> on our behalf? Don't we have leaders here to talk on our behalf?" [...] Khan replied [...] "This is how it has been and how it will be. Do you have a message?" [...] Massoud told the foreign minister that [...] "nobody who talks on our behalf will have any kind of result." [...] Consequently, neither Massoud nor Abdul Haq were consulted before and neither participated in the Battle of Jalalabad (1989) in which the ISI tried but failed to install Gulbuddin Hekmatyar as the post-communist leader of Afghanistan.|$|E
