5|$|In Japan, {{strong belief}} in astrology {{has led to}} {{dramatic}} changes in the fertility rate and the number of <b>abortions</b> <b>in</b> the years of Fire Horse. Adherents believe that women born in hinoeuma years are unmarriageable and bring bad luck to their father or husband. In 1966, the number of babies born in Japan dropped by over 25% as parents tried to avoid the stigma of having a daughter born in the hinoeuma year.|$|E

25|$|Misoprostol is {{used for}} {{self-induced}} <b>abortions</b> <b>in</b> Brazil, where black market prices exceed US$100 per dose.

Failed misoprostol abortions are associated with birth defects in some cases. Low-income and immigrant populations in New York City have also been observed to use self-administered misoprostol to induce abortions, as this method is much cheaper than a surgical abortion (about $2 per dose). The drug is readily available in Mexico. Use of misoprostol has also increased in Texas in response to increased regulation of abortion providers.|$|E
