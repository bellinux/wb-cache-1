5|$|North of Sirius lie Theta and Mu Canis Majoris, Theta {{being the}} most northerly star with a Bayer {{designation}} in the constellation. Around 8 billion years old, it is an orange giant of spectral type K4III that is around as massive as the Sun but has expanded to 30 times the Sun's diameter. Mu is a multiple star system located around 1244 light-years distant, its components discernible in a small telescope as a 5.3-magnitude yellow-hued and 7.1-magnitude bluish star. The brighter star is a giant of spectral type K2III, while the companion is a main sequence star of spectral type B9.5V. Nu Canis Majoris is a yellow-hued giant star of magnitude 5.7, 278 light-years away; it is <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> of naked-eye visibility. It has a companion of magnitude 8.1.|$|E
5|$|Shtriga is a vampiric witch in {{traditional}} Albanian folklore that sucks {{the blood of}} infants at night while they sleep, and then turns into a flying insect (traditionally a moth, fly or bee). Only the shtriga herself could cure those she had drained. The shtriga is often pictured as {{a woman with a}} hateful stare (sometimes wearing a cape) and a horribly disfigured face. The male noun for shtriga is shtrigu or shtrigan. Edith Durham recorded several methods traditionally considered effective for defending oneself from shtriga. A cross made of pig bone could be placed at the entrance of a church on Easter Sunday, rendering any shtriga inside unable to leave. They could then be captured and killed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> as they vainly attempted to pass. She further recorded the story that after draining blood from a victim, the shtriga would generally go off into the woods and regurgitate it. If a silver coin were to be soaked in that blood and wrapped in cloth, it would become an amulet offering permanent protection from any shtriga.|$|E

They have already won 19 {{straight}} – 9 in the eliminations, 8 in the semifinals, and the first 2 games of the finals series against arch rivals Toyota. In Game 3, and behind by three points at halftime, Toyota team manager Pablo Carlos fired Coach Fort Acuña on the spot for refusing to heed Carlos' demand thrice to field in Robert Jaworski in the game. The feud between Acuña and Jaworski was never revealed although rumors at that time said that their differences were “professional transcending into the personal.” Jaworski re-entered the court {{at the start of}} the 3rd canto with Carlos coaching, and although didn't exactly play well, emotionally lifted the Tamaraws to a hotly contested 97-94 victory against the Redmanizers, spoiling Crispa's chances to win the crown unbeaten. Crispa eventually won Game 4, 105-91 and ended the conference with a 20-1 slate.|$|E

500|$|Shays's Rebellion {{contributed to}} the belief that the Articles of Confederation needed to be revised. In 1787, delegates to the Philadelphia Convention, instead of {{revising}} the Articles, created a new United States Constitution with a much stronger national government. The Constitution was sent to the states for ratification, when Adams expressed his displeasure. [...] "I confess," [...] he wrote to Richard Henry Lee in 1787, [...] "as I enter the Building I stumble <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Threshold.</b> I meet with a National Government, instead of a Federal Union of States." [...] Adams was one of those derisively labeled [...] "Anti-Federalists" [...] by proponents of the new Constitution, who called themselves [...] "Federalists". Adams was elected to the Massachusetts ratifying convention which met in January 1788. Despite his reservations, Adams rarely spoke at the convention, and listened carefully to the arguments rather than raising objections. Adams and John Hancock had reconciled, and they finally agreed to give their support for the Constitution, with the proviso that some amendments be added later. Even with the support of Hancock and Adams, the Massachusetts convention narrowly ratified the Constitution by a vote of 187 to 168.|$|E
500|$|Two {{hundred years}} after Johnson's death, the posthumous {{diagnosis}} of Tourette syndrome became widely accepted. The condition was unknown during Johnson's lifetime, but Boswell describes Johnson displaying signs of Tourette syndrome, including tics and other involuntary movements.
