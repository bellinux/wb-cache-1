5|$|Although the {{earliest}} temnospondyls were primarily semiaquatic, {{they had the}} ability to feed on land. Later, eryopoids and dissorophoids, some well adapted to terrestrial life, also fed on land. Some eryopoids became better adapted toward life in water, and shifted their diets toward <b>aquatic</b> <b>organisms.</b> The first primarily aquatic feeders were archegosaurs in the Permian. Trematosaurs and capitosaurs became independently aquatic and also returned to this type of feeding.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} modify wetland habitats, most {{dramatically in}} flat {{areas such as}} the Everglades, by constructing small ponds known as alligator holes. This behavior has qualified the American alligator to be considered a keystone species. Alligator holes retain water during the dry season and provide a refuge for <b>aquatic</b> <b>organisms.</b> <b>Aquatic</b> <b>organisms</b> that survive the dry season by seeking refuge in alligator holes are a source of future populations. The construction of nests along the periphery of alligator holes, as well as a buildup of soils during the excavation process, provide drier areas for other reptiles to nest and a place for plants that are intolerant of inundation to colonize. Alligator holes are an oasis during the Everglades dry season, so are consequently important foraging sites for other organisms. In the limestone depressions of cypress swamps, alligator holes tend to be large and deep, while those in marl prairies and rocky glades are usually small and shallow, and those in peat depressions of ridge and slough wetlands are more variable.|$|E

Biological field surveys of Miller Creek in 1990 noted sea-run cutthroat trout, coho salmon, and short-head cottid, as well as abundant macroinvertebrate species including stoneflies, mayflies, caddisflies, water striders, and crayfish.|$|E
5|$|Like all rare-earth metals, cerium is of low to {{moderate}} toxicity. A strong reducing agent, it ignites spontaneously in air at 65 to 80°C. Fumes from cerium fires are toxic. Water {{should not be}} used to stop cerium fires, as cerium reacts with water to produce hydrogen gas. Workers exposed to cerium have experienced itching, sensitivity to heat, and skin lesions. Cerium is not toxic when eaten, but animals injected with large doses of cerium have died due to cardiovascular collapse. Cerium is more dangerous to <b>aquatic</b> <b>organisms,</b> on account of being damaging to cell membranes, but this is not an important risk because it is not very soluble in water.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{construction}} of the causeway, the Petitcodiac River was home to many aquatic species. Fish originally included hundreds of thousands of Atlantic tomcod and rainbow smelt, tens of thousands of gaspereau and American shad, thousands of American eel, Atlantic salmon, brook trout, lamprey, and striped bass and hundreds of Atlantic sturgeon. Other fish include the blueback herring, the brown bullhead, the chain pickerel, the smallmouth bass, the white perch, and the white sucker. Marine mammals were uncommon, but normally consisted of pilot whales, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, harbour porpoise, harbour seals, and porbeagles. Freshwater mollusc species included the brook floater, the dwarf wedgemussel, the eastern ellipto, the eastern floater, the eastern pearlshell, and the triangle floater. Many other <b>aquatic</b> <b>organisms</b> are thought to have once entered the watershed due to the low salinity of the water.|$|E
5|$|Ambulocetus natans, which lived about 49 {{million years}} ago, was {{discovered}} in Pakistan in 1994. It was probably amphibious, and looked like a crocodile. In the Eocene, ambulocetids inhabited the bays and estuaries of the Tethys Ocean in northern Pakistan. The fossils of ambulocetids are always found in near-shore shallow marine deposits associated with abundant marine plant fossils and littoral molluscs. Although they are found only in marine deposits, their oxygen isotope values indicate that they consumed water {{with a range of}} degrees of salinity, some specimens showing no evidence of sea water consumption and others none of fresh water consumption at the time when their teeth were fossilized. It is clear that ambulocetids tolerated a wide range of salt concentrations. Their diet probably included land animals that approached water for drinking, or freshwater <b>aquatic</b> <b>organisms</b> that lived in the river. Hence, ambulocetids represent the transition phase of cetacean ancestors between freshwater and marine habitat.|$|E
