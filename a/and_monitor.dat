40|$|The {{importance}} of planning <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> in any activities, more particularly researches {{can never be}} over-emphasized.

5|$|After {{the threat}} from {{invasion}} muted in 1941, the Command's attention turned to the Battle of the Atlantic. During this time, the Command used the Martin Maryland, which excelled in PR work. On 13 July 1941, the first PR Mosquito arrived, though it was some time before the aircraft was operational. By September 1941, the operational strength of the PRU's first flight was 37 Spitfires, two Marylands and two Mosquitoes. The long-range Spitfires and Mosquitoes could reach deep into German airspace, and photograph the Baltic Sea ports <b>and</b> <b>monitor</b> German surface ships. Flights of eight hours were not uncommon. One Spitfire reached Gdynia, searching for the German battleship Tirpitz. Tactics needed to vary to avoid Spitfires being intercepted by German patrols at heights of 30,000ft. Constant trips alerted the Germans to the British operations, but the Admiralty insisted in the volume of flights so they could keep tabs on German capital ships. With surprise lost, the only solution was to change the height and directions of approach.|$|E
5|$|Determined to {{complete}} the destruction of Minnesota, Catesby ap Roger Jones, acting as captain in Buchanan's absence, returned the ship to the fray the next morning, March 9. During the night, however, the ironclad Monitor had arrived and had taken a position to defend Minnesota. When Virginia approached, Monitor intercepted her. The two ironclads fought for about three hours, with neither being able to inflict significant damage on the other. The duel ended indecisively, Virginia returning to her home at the Gosport Navy Yard for repairs and strengthening, <b>and</b> <b>Monitor</b> to her station defending Minnesota. The ships did not fight again, and the blockade remained in place.|$|E
5|$|Forest pests {{present a}} {{significant}} problem {{because it is not}} easy to access the canopy <b>and</b> <b>monitor</b> pest populations. In addition, forestry pests such as bark beetles, kept under control by natural enemies in their native range, may be transported large distances in cut timber to places where they have no natural predators, enabling them to cause extensive economic damage. Pheromone traps have been used to monitor pest populations in the canopy. These release volatile chemicals that attract males. Pheromone traps can detect the arrival of pests or alert foresters to outbreaks. For example, spruce budworm has been monitored using pheromone traps in Canadian forests for several decades.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{explores the}} potential of collaborative approaches for nontimber forest product inventory <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> in the United States. It begins by reviewing results of a federal and state survey that documented inventory <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> efforts for nontimber forest products in the United States. The surveys show {{that the majority of}} NTFP-related inventory <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> on National Forests and state forests consists of non-scientific forms of monitoring, such as tracking permits, general site inspections, and informal visual checks of harvest areas. We argue that broadening participation in inventory <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> efforts can provide managers and policymakers with the data needed to develop and maintain sustainable NTFP management programs in an era of declining forest management budgets and staffing levels. Our fieldwork with NTFP harvesters identified several characteristics of harvesters and their work that could be compatible with or enhance inventory <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> efforts. In addition, harvester perspectives regarding incentives for participation are discussed. Profiles of eight participatory inventory <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> projects illustrate how this concept has already been put into practice. We then draw on our ethnographic research and results from four regional workshops to explore the barriers to involving harvesters in inventory <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> of NTFP species. In testing the idea of collaboration, we found that NTFP stakeholders are generally supportive of th...|$|R
