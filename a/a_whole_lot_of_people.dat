[...] For 15-year-old rockers in the white neighborhoods of 1979 Chicagoland, ... the chance to yell [...] "disco sucks" [...] meant more than simply a musical style choice. It {{was a chance to}} push back on a whole set of social dynamics that lied (sic) just beneath the surface of a minor battle between a DJ and a radio station that decided to change formats. More importantly, it was a chance for <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> to say they didn't like the way the world was changing around them, or who they saw as the potential victors in a cultural and demographic war.The unplayed second game of the White Sox-Tigers doubleheader remains the last American League game to be forfeited. The last National League game to be forfeited was on August 10, 1995, when a baseball giveaway promotion at Dodger Stadium went awry, forcing the Los Angeles Dodgers to concede the game to the St. Louis Cardinals. [...] According to baseball analyst Jeremiah Graves, [...] "To this day Disco Demolition Night stands in infamy {{as one of the most}} ill-advised promotions of all-time, but arguably one of the most successful as 30years later we're all still talking about it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nearing {{the end of}} the season, Perry {{continued}} his torrid scoring pace. On March 9, Perry scored two more goals, his 32nd and 33rd goal of the season, surpassing his previous career-high, single-season goal tally. Perry scored another goal in a win against Colorado. In the next game, he scored the only two goals as the Ducks lost to the Phoenix Coyotes. From March 19 through April 6, Perry recorded a least a point in ten consecutive games, later taking the League scoring lead from Steven Stamkos of the Tampa Bay Lightning when he scored two goals against the defending Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks. He then recorded his third career hat-trick in a game against the San Jose Sharks on April 6, with his third of the game giving him 50 for the year. After reaching the mark, he became just the third Ducks player to record a 50-goal season, joining Teemu Selänne and Paul Kariya. [...] "Fifty is a huge number," [...] Perry said after being serenaded with [...] "M-V-P!" [...] chants from the Honda Center crowd in Anaheim.

5000|$|When {{asked by}} Jude why evil {{exists in the}} world, Liandra {{explains}} that God wants to die. She states that humanity {{was intended to be}} God's crowning achievement, and was prepared to move on after its creation. However, the constant prayers of people on Earth prevent him from being able to do this. For centuries, God has been sending disasters to Earth in the hope that people will stop believing in Him and let Him pass. Peter David acknowledged that this is a somewhat unusual and controversial take on God: The fun thing is that I ran it past a reform rabbi I encountered at San Diego con and {{he told me he was}} reasonably sure he hadn't heard anyone else come up with it before. So I'm pretty confident that the 'truth' the Fallen Angel provides Jude is going to piss off <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> Because on the one hand it will come across as pretty blasphemous, but on the other hand, it makes a frightening amount of sense.|$|E
