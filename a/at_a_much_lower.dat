TVA could provide electricity <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>lower</b> cost, but voters would first have to hold a public referendum on buying out Kentucky Utilities, the private power provider in the area. Carroll agreed to lead the campaign, and nine months later, voters approved the buyout by a three-to-one margin.|$|E
5|$|On Earth, the {{northern}} polar jet stream {{is the most}} important one for aviation and weather forecasting, as it is much stronger and <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>lower</b> altitude than the subtropical jet streams and also covers many countries in the Northern Hemisphere, while the southern polar jet stream mostly circles Antarctica and sometimes the southern tip of South America.

5|$|After Biman {{became a}} public limited company, renewed {{attempts}} were made to procure new-generation aircraft to replace its ageing fleet. In November 2007, Boeing made an offer to supply Biman with four Boeing 777-200s (with options for two more) to be delivered by 2013 and four Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners (with options for two more) to be delivered by 2017 and provide similar aircraft on lease for the interim period beginning in 2009. The average price of these aircraft was quoted as million. Airbus also made an offer to supply four Airbus A320 or Airbus A330 series aircraft <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>lower</b> price than that of Boeing. To manage the fleet in the short run, Biman again floated a tender in January 2008 to purchase/dry lease with options to purchase two used Airbus A310-300 aircraft.|$|E

Later in 1976 due to the album's strong sales, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified Lazy Afternoon Gold on April 14, 1976 for shipments of 500,000 copies.
