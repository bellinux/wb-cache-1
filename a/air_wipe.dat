[...] Mitscher, with Admiral Spruance at the Battle of the Philippine Sea (the Marianas Turkey Shoot), drew his conclusion from the very poor performance of the Japanese. Halsey ignored Mitscher's insights, and made an understandable and, to him, prudent threat-conservative judgment that Ozawa's force was still capable of launching serious attacks. Halsey later explained his actions partly by explicitly stating {{he did not want to}} be [...] "shuttle bombed" [...] by Ozawa's force (a technique whereby planes can land and rearm at bases on either side of a foe, allowing them to attack on both the outbound flight and the return), or to give them a [...] "free shot" [...] at the U.S. forces in Leyte Gulf. He was obviously not similarly concerned with giving Kurita's battleships and cruisers a free shot at those same forces.|$|R

40|$|In 1994 {{officials}} from the Ohio Department of Health reported that some residents of Lorain County, Ohio, possibly {{had been exposed to}} methyl parathion (MP), a highly toxic restricted-use pesticide. The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assisted in the investigation by providing epidemiologic and laboratory support to the state and local health departments. Although the initial investigation found MP inside the homes, it was unclear if the residents were exposed. CDC used a new biological monitoring method to measure urinary p-nitrophenol (PNP), the metabolite of MP. This biological monitoring measures the internal dose from exposure to toxic chemicals from all routes. Laboratory analyses demonstrated that the urine of residents contained moderate to high levels of PNP, with median, mean, and highest reported concentrations of 28, 240, and 4, 800 g/L, respectively, thus confirming exposure of the residents. Almost 80 % of the residents had urinary PNP concentrations above the 95 th percentile of the reference range concentrations.

40|$|We {{collected}} indoor <b>air,</b> surface <b>wipes</b> (floors, table tops, {{and window}} sills), and floor dust samples at multiple locations within 11 occupied and two unoccupied homes {{both before and}} after lawn application of the herbicide 2, 4 -D. We measured residues 1 week before and after application. We used collected samples to determine transport routes of 2, 4 -D from the lawn into the homes, its subsequent distribution between the indoor surfaces, and air concentration as a function of airborne particle size. We used residue measurements to estimate potential exposures within these homes. After lawn application, 2, 4 -D was detected in indoor air and on all surfaces throughout all homes. Track-in by an active dog and by the homeowner applicator were the most significant factors for intrusion. Resuspension of floor dust was the major source of 2, 4 -D in indoor air, with highest levels of 2, 4 -D found in the particle size range of 2. 5 â 10 Âµm. Resuspended floor dust was also a major source of 2, 4 -D on tables and window sills. Estimated postapplication indoor exposure levels for young children from nondietary ingestion may be 1 â 10 Âµg/day from contact with floors, and 0. 2 â 30 Âµg/day from contact with table tops. These are estimated to be about 10 times higher than the preapplication exposures. By comparison, dietary ingestion of 2, 4 -D is approximately 1. 3 Âµg/day.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} the study was to assess non-dietary {{exposure}} of workers and the general population in the Paris area to some organophosphorus (OP) pesticides. In total, 21 workers from different occupational places (two greenhouses, three florist shops and three veterinary departments) and 20 subjects assumed to be non-occupationally exposed were recruited. Indoor <b>air,</b> hand <b>wipes,</b> and three first morning urine samples were collected. Seven OPs were measured by GC/ECD and GC/TSD, and six urinary dialkylphosphate metabolites by GC/PFPD. All indoor air samples from the workplaces and only one-third of the samples from the residences contained at least one of the seven OPs. However, almost all participants were dermally exposed to OPs. Total OP indoor air and cutaneous levels were significantly higher for workers than for the general population (air median = 185 pmol/m(3) Versus nondetectable, P< 0. 0001; hands median = 1250 pmol/hands versus 475 pmol/hands, P = 0. 03). From the air, gardeners and florists were mainly exposed to methyl-OPs and veterinary staff to ethyl-OPs (mainly diazinon). From their hands, all subjects were exposed to methyl-OPs, with gardeners and florists exposed to somewhat but not significantly higher levels. Ethyl-OPs were more found frequently and at higher levels on the hands of veterinary workers. Total OP levels in indoor air and from hand wipes were significantly correlated (Spearman R = 0. 34, P = 0. 03). DAP detection frequencies and levels were not different between workers and the general population (workers median = 168 nmol/g creat and general population median = 241 nmol/g creat, P= 0. 31), and did not correlate with air or hand levels. Subjects not occupationally exposed showed significant residential exposure to OPs, more frequently from their hands than from the air. Different occupations were associated with different exposure profiles and levels. The lack of differences in DAP levels between the different groups of exposure suggests that dietary exposure to OP residues and exposure to other OPs are involved...|$|R

40|$|Barrier creams and barrier creams with {{antifungal}} agents {{both are}} effective treatments of diaper dermatitis. Fungal yeast {{is present in}} over 90 % of diaper rashes, but {{is not necessarily the}} causative agent. In mild cases, antifungal agents may not perform better than barrier creams alone. In moderate to severe cases, patients will likely benefit from using an antifungal agent. For patients at increased risk for diaper dermatitis, such as those with diarrhea, taking oral antibiotics, wearing low-absorbance diaper material, better prevention may be possible using barrier cream with antifungal.

40|$|Objectives To assess livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) {{carriage}} among {{workers in}} pig slaughterhouses and assess associated risk factors, including occupational exposure to LA-MRSA. Methods A cross-sectional study in three Dutch pig slaughterhouses was undertaken. Nasal swabs of participants were taken. Nasal swabs and surface <b>wipes,</b> <b>air</b> and glove samples were screened for presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). MRSA was quantitatively determined on gloves and in air samples by culturing and real-time PCR. Results 11 of 341 (3. 2 %) participants {{were identified as}} nasal MRSA carriers. MRSA-positive workers were predominantly found {{at the start of}} the slaughter process. Major risk factors for carriage were working in the lairage and working in the scalding and dehairing area. Most nasal isolates (73 %) belonged to the LA-MRSA clone ST 398. MRSA ST 398 -positive environmental samples were found throughout the slaughter process. A clear decrease was seen along the slaughterline in the number of MRSA-positive samples and in the MRSA amount per sample. Conclusions This study showed that working in the lairage area or scalding and dehairing area were the major risk factors for MRSA carriage in pig slaughterhouse workers, while the overall prevalence of MRSA carriage is low.

40|$|Turnout gear {{provides}} {{protection against}} dermal exposure to contaminants during firefighting; however, {{the level of}} protection is unknown. We explored the dermal contribution to the systemic dose of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other aromatic hydrocarbons in firefighters during suppression and overhaul of controlled structure burns. The study was organized into two rounds, three controlled burns per round, and five firefighters per burn. The firefighters wore new or laundered turnout gear tested before each burn to ensure lack of PAH contamination. To ensure that any increase in systemic PAH levels after the burn {{was the result of}} dermal rather than inhalation exposure, the firefighters did not remove their self-contained breathing apparatus until overhaul was completed and they were > 30 m upwind from the burn structure. Specimens were collected before and at intervals after the burn for biomarker analysis. Urine was analyzed for phenanthrene equivalents using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a benzene metabolite (s-phenylmercapturic acid) using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry; both were adjusted by creatinine. Exhaled breath collected on thermal desorption tubes was analyzed for PAHs and other aromatic hydrocarbons using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. We collected personal air samples during the burn and skin wipe samples (corn oil medium) on several body sites before and after the burn. The <b>air</b> and <b>wipe</b> samples were analyzed for PAHs using a liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection. We explored possible changes in external exposures or biomarkers over time and the relationships between these variables using non-parametric sign tests and Spearman tests, respectively. We found significantly elevated (P < 0. 05) post-exposure breath concentrations of benzene compared with pre-exposure concentrations for both rounds. We also found significantly elevated post-exposure levels of PAHs on the neck compared with pre-exposure levels for round 1. We found statistically significant positive correlations between external exposures (i. e. personal air concentrations of PAHs) and biomarkers (i. e. change in urinary PAH metabolite levels in round 1 and change in breath concentrations of benzene in round 2). The results suggest that firefighters wearing full protective ensembles absorbed combustion products into their bodies. The PAHs most likely entered firefighters' bodies through their skin, with the neck being the primary site of exposure and absorption due to the lower level of dermal protection afforded by hoods. Aromatic hydrocarbons could have been absorbed dermally during firefighting or inhaled during the doffing of gear that was off-gassing contaminants...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHuman {{exposure}} to consumer chemicals {{has become a}} worldwide concern. In this work, a comprehensive sampling strategy is presented, to our knowledge being the first to study all relevant exposure pathways in a single cohort using multiple methods for assessment of exposure from each exposure pathway. The selected groups of chemicals to be studied are consumer chemicals whose production and use are currently {{in a state of}} transition and are; per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs), traditional and âemergingâ brominated flame retardants (BFRs and EBFRs), organophosphate esters (OPEs) and phthalate esters (PEs). Information about human {{exposure to}} these contaminants is needed due to existing data gaps on human exposure intakes from multiple exposure pathways and relationships between internal and external exposure. Indoor environment, food and biological samples were collected from 61 participants and their households in the Oslo area (Norway) on two consecutive days, during winter 2013 - 14. <b>Air,</b> dust, hand <b>wipes,</b> and duplicate diet (food and drink) samples were collected as indicators of external exposure, and blood, urine, blood spots, hair, nails and saliva as indicators of internal exposure.

40|$|The Health Hazard Evaluation Program {{received}} {{a request from}} {{the manager of a}} federal government office complex. Employees were concerned about health problems including cancer, gallbladder problems, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Some employees believed their health problems were associated with contamination of the buildings, soil, and groundwater from an adjoining weapons component manufacturing agency. The entire complex consisted of 13 buildings with the largest structure at the site containing over 1 million square feet across three floors. This structure contained two main areas: (1) Buildings 1 and 2 (office and warehouse space where most of the complex's employees worked) and (2) the weapons component agency. A floor-to-ceiling fire wall physically separated Buildings 1 and 2 from the weapons component agency. We reviewed environmental sampling records, did a visual inspection of Building 1 and 2 ventilation systems, spoke with employees about their health. We also tested former and current employees with sarcoidosis (an inflammatory disease that is nearly identical to chronic beryllium disease) for sensitization to beryllium, which was used for weapons manufacturing. Our evaluation found (1) no reports of employee overexposures to volatile organic compounds, polychlorinated biphenyls, beryllium or other metals, solvents, formaldehyde, or radon; (2) no evidence of beryllium sensitization among 22 persons tested; and (3) no cancer excess or abnormal pattern of disease. We noted that (1) Buildings 1 and 2 have separate ventilation systems from the weapons component agency and (2) potentially contaminated exhaust air from the weapons component agency was unlikely to enter the outdoor air intake(s) for Building 1 and 2.

A questionnaire was administered to each family to determine pesticide use and work practices. Urine samples were collected from the participants and dust, <b>wipe</b> and <b>air</b> samples were collected from each home. Atrazine was the agricultural pesticide used most by farmers and more than one agricultural pesticide was applied on most farms. Most farmers changed from their work clothes and shoes in the home, and when they changed outside they usually brought their clothes and shoes inside. Greater than 88 % of the air and 74 % of the wipe samples were below the limit of detection (LOD). Among the <b>air</b> and <b>wipe</b> samples, chlorpyrifos was detected most frequently in homes. In the dust samples, all the pesticides were detected in greater than 50 % of the samples except acetochlor and alachlor, which were detected in less than 30 % of the samples. Pesticides in dust samples were detected more often in farm homes except 2, 4 -D, which was detected in 100 percent of the farm and non-farm home samples. All farms where a pesticide was sprayed had higher levels of that pesticide in dust than both farms that did not spray that pesticide and non-farms, however, only atrazine and metolachlor were significantly higher. For atrazine, acetochlor, metolachlor and 2, 4 -D, farmers who reported applying the pesticide had significantly higher urinary metabolite levels than non-farmers, farmers who did not apply the pesticide, and farmers who had the pesticide commercially applied. The adjusted geometric mean (GM) level of the urine metabolite of atrazine was significantly higher in fathers, mothers and children from farm households compared to those from non-farm households. Urine metabolites of chlorpyrifos were significantly higher in farm fathers and marginally higher in farm mothers when compared to non-farm fathers and mothers, but metolachlor and glyphosate levels were similar between the two groups. Farm children had significantly higher urinary atrazine and chlorpyrifos levels (p = 0. 03 and p = 0. 03 respectively) when these pesticides were applied by their fathers prior to sample collection than those of farm children where these pesticides were not recently applied. Estimated doses for the children were calculated for atrazine, metolachlor, chlorpyrifos and glyphosate from urinary concentrations. For all pesticides except glyphosate, the doses from farm children were higher than doses from the non-farm children. The difference was statistically significant for atrazine but only marginally significant for chlorpyrifos and metolachlor. None of the doses exceeded the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chronic reference values for atrazine, metolachlor and glyphosate; however, all of the doses for chlorpyrifos exceeded the EPA chronic population adjusted reference value. The results show that farm homes are contaminated with pesticides and exposure of inhabitants is occurring...|$|R
40|$|Phthalate esters (PEs) and {{organophosphate}} esters (OPEs) {{are common}} indoor pollutants frequently detected in environmental (dust, <b>air),</b> personal (hand <b>wipes,</b> diet) and human matrices (urine, serum etc.). In this thesis, mathematical models {{were used to}} establish links between intake and body burden for a comprehensive dataset based on a Norwegian study population. Also, {{the relative importance of}} different PE uptake pathways was assessed and discussed. Furthermore, the suitability of human nails as an alternative, non-invasive biomonitoring matrix for PEs was investigated. Additionally, information regarding alternative plasticizers to PEs was collected and presented extensively. Results showed that for PEs (paper II), daily intakes based on external exposure media agree with back-calculations using urinary metabolite concentrations, leading to the conclusion that human exposure for the general adult population is well understood and that the most important uptake routes were captured. Overall intake levels are comparable or lower than level presented in recent comprehensive studies and hazard quotients were well below 1 (low risk). As expected, diet was found {{to be the most important}} uptake route for all PEs. For lower molecular weight PEs, inhalation becomes a strong contributing pathway whereas for higher molecular weight PEs, dust ingestion was also important. Daily intake based on hand wipes was found to be much lower than the estimated total dermal intake based on air, dust and personal care products, questioning the relevance of hand wipes to represent total dermal exposure. Human nails were found to be unsuitable for replacing urine as a biomonitoring matrix for PEs as internal intake (from blood) cannot explain measured nail concentrations and uptake from air is too slow to reach observed concentrations within a realistic time frame (paper III). Hence, the kinetic links between intake and nail concentrations could not be established. Although exposure to traditional PEs is decreasing, use and body burden of some alternatives are increasing (paper I). Fortunately, most alternative plasticizers have favorable toxicological properties, resulting in low risk for humans. In contrast to PEs, OPEs still remain a group of poorly studied substances in terms of human exposure (paper IV). Due to lack of information regarding human metabolism, reliable links between intake and concentrations in serum and urine could not be established. Modelling results showed that concentrations in serum, and to some extent, urine, were underestimated for 2 compounds. It is likely that a combination of missing intake and suboptimal biomarkers were the cause for this under-prediction. Because of this, further studies regarding human metabolism should be performed for OPEs and potentially more specific biomarkers identified in the future. For PEs, there is a need for more comprehensive datasets to study exposure for high risk groups such as infants and children. Furthermore, dermal uptake remains poorly understood and the uptake of PEs into human nails should be studied in more detail to establish the kinetic links between exposure and body burden.

40|$|A highly {{sensitive}} gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analytical method for {{the determination of}} the opioid narcotics fentanyl, alfentanil, and sufentanil in industrial hygiene personal air samples and surface contamination wipes was developed and comprehensively validated. Sample preparation involved a single step extraction of the samples with methanol, fortified with a fixed amount of the penta-deuterated analogues of the opioid narcotics as internal standard. The GC-MS analytical procedure using selected ion monitoring (SIM) was shown to be highly selective. Linearity was shown for levels of extracted <b>wipe</b> and <b>air</b> samples corresponding to at least 0. 1 - 2 times their surface contamination limit (SCL) and accordingly to 0. 1 - 2 times their time weighted average occupational exposure limit (OEL-TWA) based on a full shift 9601 air sample. Extraction recoveries were determined for spiked air samples and surface wipes and were found to be quantitative for both sampling media in the entire range studied. The air sampling method's limit of detection (LOD) was determined to be 0. 4 ng per sample for fentanyl and sufentanil and 1. 6 ng per sample for alfentanil, corresponding to less than 1 % of their individual OEL for a full shift air sample (9601). The limit of quantification (LOQ) was found to be 1. 4, 1. 2, and 5. 0 ng per filter for fentanyl, sufentanil, and alfentanil, respectively. The wipe sampling method had LODs of 4 ng per wipe for fentanyl and sufentanil and 16 ng per wipe for alfentanil and LOQs of respectively, 14, 12, and 50 ng per wipe. The analytical intra-assay precision of the <b>air</b> sampling and <b>wipe</b> sampling method, defined as the coefficient of variation on the analytical result of six replicate spiked media was below 10 and 5 %, respectively, for all opioids at all spike levels. Accuracy expressed as relative error was determined to be below 10 %, except for alfentanil at the lowest spike level (- 13. 1 %). The stability of the opioids during simulated air sampling was investigated. For fentanyl and sufentanil a quantitative recovery was observed at all spike levels, while for alfentanil recoveries ranged from 60. 3 to 85. 4 %. When spiked air samples were stored at ambient temperature and at - 15 degrees C quantitative recovery was found for fentanyl and sufentanil after 7 and 14 days. For alfentanil a slight loss seemed to occur upon storage during 7 days, being more explicit after 14 days. Ambient storage of spiked wipes seemed to lead to significant losses of all opioids studied, yielding recoveries of 37. 7 - 88. 3 %. Upon storage of similar wipes at - 15 degrees C a significantly higher recovery was found ranging from 77. 3 to 88. 3 %. The developed analytical and sampling procedures have been recently applied in an explorative field study of which the results of surface contamination wipe sampling are presented in this paper. To our knowledge, this is the first study addressing the development and validation of analytical procedures for the assessment of external occupational exposure to potent opioid narcotics. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|Days after {{returning}} to England, as the First Division's joint top-scorer (level on 28 goals with Southampton's Ron Davies) Best was presented with the FWA Footballer of the Year award, becoming the youngest ever recipient of the award. Facing United in the European Cup Final at Wembley were Benfica; whilst his teammates rested, Best found [...] "a novel way to relax" [...] before the big game by sleeping with [...] "a particular young lady called Sue". The game went into extra-time, and just three minutes into extra-time Best went on a mazy run and beat goalkeeper JosÃ© Henrique with a dummy, before rolling {{the ball into the}} net; two further goals from Brian Kidd and Bobby Charlton settled the tie at 4-1. The victory was not only the pinnacle of Best's career, but arguably Manchester United's greatest achievement, considering the Munich <b>air</b> disaster had <b>wiped</b> out most of the Busby Babes just ten years previously. Best also won the Ballon d'Or in 1968 after receiving more votes than Bobby Charlton, Dragan DÅ¾ajiÄ and Franz Beckenbauer. This meant that he had won the three major honours in club football at the age of just 22 (the league title, European Cup, and European Player of the Year award). After this, his steady decline began. [...] "It seems impossible to hurt him. All manner of men have tried to intimidate him. Best merely glides along, riding tackles and brushing giants aside like leaves." [...] â Joe Mercer, Manchester City manager, 1969. The 'holy trinity' of Best, Law and Charlton remained effective as ever in the 1968-69 campaign. However the club's new recruits were not up to scratch, as United dropped to 11th in the league before Busby announced his retirement. Best later said that [...] "I increasingly had the feeling that I was carrying the team at times on the pitch." [...] He scored 22 goals in 55 games, though only he and Denis Law scored more than six league goals. In the Intercontinental Cup, fans and players alike looked forward to seeing United take on Argentine opposition Estudiantes de La Plata over the course of two legs. However Best said [...] "no one tackled harder or dirtier than this Argentinian team" [...] as a 1-0 defeat at the Estadio Camilo Cichero was followed by a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford. In the home tie, Best was kicked and spat on by JosÃ© Hugo Medina, and both players were sent off after Best reacted with a punch. Despite their poor league form, United managed to reach the semi-finals of the European Cup (they had a relatively easy run in getting past the Republic of Ireland's Waterford United, Belgium's Anderlecht, and Austria's Rapid Wien) where they were knocked out 2-1 on aggregate by A.C. Milan following a 2-0 defeat at the San Siro; Milan goalkeeper Fabio Cudicini was the hero after keeping United to only one goal at Old Trafford. [...] "It's been a joke on the circuit ever since. You know, I'm {{on one side of the}} street, George Best is on the other. He nods to me and I dive under a bus." [...] â Northampton goalkeeper Kim Book laughs about the jibes he has faced since being fooled by Best's feint in the 1970 FA Cup game against Manchester United. United improved slightly under new boss Wilf McGuinness, but still only managed an eighth-place finish in the 1969-70 season. Best hit 23 goals, including an FA Cup record six goals in an 8-2 win over Northampton Town in a mud-bath at the County Ground on 7 February 1970.|$|R
