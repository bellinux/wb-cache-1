At either end, and beneath the scenes are the figures of twelve {{men and women who}} prophesied the birth of Jesus. On the crescent-shaped areas, or lunettes, above each of the chapel's windows are tablets listing the Ancestors of Christ and <b>accompanying</b> <b>figures.</b> Above them, in the triangular spandrels, a further eight groups of figures are shown, but these have not been identified with specific Biblical characters. The scheme is completed by four large corner pendentives, each illustrating a dramatic Biblical story.|$|E

2500|$|The Golden Madonna is {{both the}} oldest known {{sculpture}} of the Madonna and the oldest free-standing sculpture north of the Alps. It {{is also one of}} only two extant medieval gilded cult images. Gilded sculptures are frequently mentioned in medieval documents, but apart from an image of Saint Fides in the abbey of Saint-Foy in Conques in Southern France no such artifacts survive (the Madonna of Hildesheim was stripped of its original gold-leaf covering at some time). We know Charlemagne had a life-size crucifix with the figure of Christ in gold in his Palatine Chapel in Aachen, the oldest such object to be described, and many similar figures in precious metal, all now vanished, are recorded in large Anglo-Saxon churches and elsewhere. [...] Most often they are crucifixes, and sometimes <b>accompanying</b> <b>figures</b> of Mary and John the Evangelist are mentioned, as for example those by Spearhafoc in the 11th century.|$|E

2500|$|The Crucifix is {{in general}} the most {{significant}} single narrative object in the decorative scheme of any church. During the medieval period the crucifix, called the Rood in England, from the Old Saxon roda, was a large crucifix placed conspicuously, often suspended in the Quire or standing on a screen separating either the Quire or the sanctuary {{from the rest of}} the church. The suspended crucifix could either be painted or carved of wood. In England where rood screens have often survived without the rood itself, it was general for the crucifix to have <b>accompanying</b> <b>figures</b> of Mary the Mother of Christ and either John the Evangelist or John the Baptist carrying a banner bearing the inscription [...] "Behold, the Lamb of God". In Italy, roods were created by some of the most famous painters and sculptors, such as Giotto, Brunelleschi and Donatello. In many Protestant churches the crucifix has been replaced by a simple cross without a figure, symbolically representing both the redeeming sacrifice and the resurrection to new life offered by Jesus.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{earliest}} documented large-scale (...) electrotype sculptures was John Evan Thomas's Death of Tewdric Mawr, King of Gwent (1849). The electrotype was done by Elkington, Mason, & Co. for the Great Exhibition of 1851. Among the most spectacular early examples are Josef Hermann's twelve angels (1858) {{at the base of}} the cupola of Saint Isaac's Cathedral in St. Petersburg, Russia (see photograph A below). As described by Théophile Gautier in 1867, [...] "They are twenty-one feet high, and were made by the galvanoplastic process in four pieces, whose welding together is invisible. They could in this manner be made so light that, in spite of their dimensions, they would not be too heavy for the cupola. This crown of gilt angels, poised amid a flood of light, and shining with rich reflections, produces an extremely rich effect." [...] Other important sculptures followed; David A. Scott has written, [...] "Some extremely important commissions were made in electrotypes, such as the [...] "bronzes" [...] that adorn the Opera, Paris, and the 320cm high statue of Prince Albert and four <b>accompanying</b> <b>figures,</b> erected behind the Albert Hall in London as a memorial to the Great Exhibition of 1851." [...] The statue of Prince Albert was unveiled in 1861 (see photograph B below); the electrotyping process [...] "was one in which the Prince Consort had had great faith." [...] The Palais Garnier in Paris (the Opera) has two 7.5 meter tall sculptures above the main facade; the building was completed in 1869 (see photograph C below).|$|E

60|$|Before we conclude, {{it will be}} well to add a few {{remarks on}} the {{ornaments}} of monkeys. In most of the species the sexes resemble each other in colour, but in some, as we have seen, the males differ from the females, especially in the colour of the naked parts of the skin, {{in the development of}} the beard, whiskers, and mane. Many species are coloured either in so extraordinary or so beautiful a manner, and are furnished with such curious and elegant crests of hair, that we can hardly avoid looking at these characters as having been gained for the sake of ornament. The <b>accompanying</b> <b>figures</b> (Figs. 72 to 76) serve to shew the arrangement of the hair on the face and head in several species. It is scarcely conceivable that these crests of hair, and the strongly contrasted colours of the fur and skin, can be the result of mere variability without the aid of selection; and it is inconceivable that they can be of use in any ordinary way to these animals. If so, they have probably been gained through sexual selection, though transmitted equally, or almost equally, to both sexes. With many of the Quadrumana, we have additional evidence of the action of sexual selection in the greater size and strength of the males, and in the greater development of their canine teeth, in comparison with the females.|$|E
