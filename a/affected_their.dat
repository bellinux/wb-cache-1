5|$|An {{employer}} who terminates {{an employee}} {{for being an}} alcoholic is {{in violation of the}} state's anti-discrimination laws unless they can show that person's condition <b>affected</b> <b>their</b> job performance or created a substantial safety risk. No general hospitals may refuse a patient treatment for intoxication or alcoholism, and all individual and group health insurance plans which are regulated by the state of New Jersey are required to offer both inpatient and outpatient treatment for alcoholism. Under federal law, all group health insurances plans for private companies with more than 50 employees must offer insurance coverage for alcoholism that is equal to their insurance coverage for other medical conditions.|$|E
5|$|By 1980, the USACE {{was working}} to obtain funding, {{which was the}} major {{obstacle}} for completion; public concerns about the project were {{that it was not}} needed and would be too costly. The USACE announced in 1981 that an environmental impact report was necessary before the project could begin, following the Endangered Species Act of 1973; the least tern and light-footed clapper rail were considered endangered, and construction would have <b>affected</b> <b>their</b> habitat. The next year, the environmental impact report process began, funded by the USACE.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the rural}} ranchers and Cowboys resented the growing {{influence}} of the city residents over county politics and law enforcement. The ranchers largely maintained {{control of the country}} outside Tombstone, {{due in large part to}} the sympathetic support of Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan, who favored the Cowboys and rural ranchers, and who also grew to intensely dislike the Earps. Behan tended to ignore the Earps' complaints about the McLaurys' and Clantons' horse thieving and cattle rustling. The Earps were known to bend the law in their favor when it <b>affected</b> <b>their</b> gambling and saloon interests, which earned them further enmity with the Cowboy faction.|$|E

5|$|Executive {{producer}} Hironobu Sakaguchi {{stated that}} {{the idea for the}} game first came up in February 1997. The original idea for Brave Fencer Musashi was having Miyamoto Musashi fighting in an alternate world from where he belonged. While the game conceptualized as an action oriented, Musashi was originally meant to be a wanderer. However, he was later changed to an itinerant Samaritan in order to have him interacting and helping other characters. During development, the team used an action base which was crucial to the game's fighting mechanics. Director Yoichi Yoshimoto was focused on the game's fully polygonal aspects that were a departure from Square's previous works. The development team prioritized the movement of polygons in real time and how light <b>affected</b> <b>their</b> appearance.|$|E

5|$|Outside of Toamasina, Honorinina damaged {{roads and}} rail lines {{connecting}} {{the city with}} the capital, Antananarivo. Several other roads were damaged by landslides or washouts, and many bridges were damaged. The high winds damaged or destroyed thousands of homes along the storm's path, leaving 83,885people homeless. Many of the damaged homes lost their roofs, which resulted in additional damage when the heavy rainfall <b>affected</b> <b>their</b> interiors. The high winds also damaged many public buildings and factories along its path. The cyclone left widespread areas without water or power; the storm damaged electrical transmission and generation facilities. The high rainfall damaged dykes in Andromba and along the Ikopa and Sisaony rivers. Across the country, Honorinina killed 99people, and caused 424injuries. Damage totaled about $150million (1986USD).|$|E
5|$|Participation in the Crusades {{was also}} {{seen as a}} form of pilgrimage, and indeed the same Latin word, peregrinatio, was {{sometimes}} applied to both activities. While English participation in the First Crusade between 1095 and 1099 was limited, England played a prominent part in the Second, Third and Fifth Crusades over the next two centuries, with many crusaders leaving for the Levant during the intervening years. The idea of undertaking a pilgrimage to Jerusalem was not new in England, however, as the idea of religiously justified warfare went back to Anglo-Saxon times. Many of those who took up the Cross to go on a Crusade never actually left, often because the individual lacked sufficient funds to undertake the journey. Raising funds to travel typically involved crusaders selling or mortgaging their lands and possessions, which <b>affected</b> <b>their</b> families and, at times, considerably affected the economy as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Transport links {{generally}} {{are regarded as}} an important factor which affects a company’s decision on where to locate, and thus invest, although the latest survey shows quality of telecommunications moving above transport in importance.

The survey has been criticised as suffering from a poor response rate and therefore open to bias, though this issue has been recognised and rationalised by the report's authors.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{with their}} {{previous}} albums, the group produced Sons of Soul entirely themselves. They utilized both vintage and contemporary recording gear in the album's production, including a Hammond B-3, Clavinet, ARP String Ensemble, and Korg and Roland synthesizers. Riley viewed that hearing music played {{from the older}} instruments <b>affected</b> <b>their</b> songwriting. For his vocals, Raphael recorded with Neumann U87 and AKG C12A condensor microphones, {{as well as a}} vintage RCA Type77-DX microphone. He used a custom five-string bass from a guitar and bass repair shop in San Francisco, as well as a Minimoog analog synthesizer for other bass lines on the album. D'wayne used a Microtech Gefell UM70 for his lead vocals and an AKG 414 for his background vocals. He played a vintage Gibson L6-S and a Fender Coronado guitar, modified with Gibson burst bucker pickups. Aside from his drumming, Riley played both Wurlitzer and Fender Rhodes electric pianos.|$|E
5|$|Water {{security}} and food security are inextricably linked. In the decade 1951–60 human water withdrawals were four {{times greater than}} the previous decade. This rapid increase resulted from scientific and technological developments impacting through the economy—especially the increase in irrigated land, growth in industrial and power sectors, and intensive dam construction on all continents. This altered the water cycle of rivers and lakes, <b>affected</b> <b>their</b> water quality and {{had a significant impact on}} the global water cycle. Currently towards 35% of human water use is unsustainable, drawing on diminishing aquifers and reducing the flows of major rivers: this percentage is likely to increase if climate change impacts become more severe, populations increase, aquifers become progressively depleted and supplies become polluted and unsanitary. From 1961 to 2001 water demand doubled—agricultural use increased by 75%, industrial use by more than 200%, and domestic use more than 400%. In the 1990s it was estimated that humans were using 40–50% of the globally available freshwater in the approximate proportion of 70% for agriculture, 22% for industry, and 8% for domestic purposes with total use progressively increasing.|$|E
5|$|Yet another {{trait that}} sets most lemurs apart from anthropoid {{primates}} is their long lifespan {{together with their}} high infant mortality. Many lemurs, including the ring-tailed lemur, have adapted to a highly seasonal environment, which has <b>affected</b> <b>their</b> birthrate, maturation, and twinning rate (r-selection). This helps them to recover rapidly from a population crash. In captivity, lemurs can live {{twice as long as}} they do in the wild, benefiting from consistent nutrition that meets their dietary requirements, medical advancements, and improved understanding of their housing requirements. In 1960, it was thought that lemurs could live between 23 and 25 years. We now know that the larger species can live for more than 30 years without showing signs of aging (senescence) and still be capable of reproduction.|$|E

5|$|Julian's comitatus, {{although}} only half its normal size, was of high quality, containing {{some of the}} best regiments in the Late Roman army, with an awesome combat reputation. All were palatini (top-grade regiments). A substantial proportion of his troops were of barbarian, mostly Germanic, birth. An analysis of known names of officers and men in the auxilia palatina infantry regiments suggests that anywhere between 33% and 50% of the effectives were barbarian-born (the Roman-born troops were mostly Gallo-Romans). Of the German-born recruits, many would probably have been Alamanni. There is little evidence that this <b>affected</b> <b>their</b> loyalty. On the contrary, the history of Julian's Gallic campaign shows that his barbarian troops were fiercely loyal and reliable. It is true that there were a few isolated cases of Germanic deserters who defected to the enemy, but these were mostly motivated by personal reasons, not by ethnic solidarity. The only recorded instance of the latter was an officer who allegedly alerted members of his own tribe that Julian was planning a campaign against them. In the vast majority of cases, it is clear that regimental loyalties prevailed over ethnic ones. This is evidenced by the fierce alacrity of Julian's troops to engage with the enemy and the determination with which they fought the battle (3 of the 4 tribuni killed at Strasbourg had barbarian names). Regarding training, the Roman troops were career professionals, constantly drilled in formation manoeuvres and combat techniques. Their most important advantage in a pitched battle was formation drill: the ability to hold one's position in a unit at regular intervals, and to replace fallen comrades, so that a unit maintains its shape and coherence as it moves or engages.|$|E
5|$|The Kinks' {{second wave}} of {{popularity}} remained at a peak with State of Confusion, but that success began to fade, a trend that also <b>affected</b> <b>their</b> British rock contemporaries the Rolling Stones and the Who. During {{the second half of}} 1983, Ray Davies started work on an ambitious solo film project, Return to Waterloo, about a London commuter who daydreams that he is a serial murderer. The film gave actor Tim Roth a significant early role. Davies' commitment to writing, directing and scoring the new work caused tension in his relationship with his brother. Another problem was the stormy end of the relationship between Ray Davies and Chrissie Hynde. The old feud between Dave Davies and drummer Mick Avory also re-ignited. Davies eventually refused to work with Avory, and called for him to be replaced by Bob Henrit, former drummer of Argent (of which Jim Rodford had also been a member). Avory left the band, and Henrit was brought in to take his place. Ray Davies, who was still on amiable terms with Avory, invited him to manage Konk Studios. Avory accepted, and continued to serve as a producer and occasional contributor on later Kinks albums.|$|E
