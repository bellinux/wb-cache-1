5|$|When the {{pressure}} within the skull (intracranial pressure, abbreviated ICP) rises too high, {{it can be}} deadly. Signs of increased ICP include decreasing level of consciousness, paralysis or weakness {{on one side of}} the body, and a blown pupil, one that fails to constrict in response to light or is slow to do so. Cushing's triad, a slow heart rate with high blood pressure and respiratory depression is a classic manifestation of significantly raised ICP. <b>Anisocoria,</b> unequal pupil size, is another sign of serious TBI. Abnormal posturing, a characteristic positioning of the limbs caused by severe diffuse injury or high ICP, is an ominous sign.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anisocoria</b> {{is usually}} a benign finding, unaccompanied by other {{symptoms}} (physiological <b>anisocoria).</b> Old face photographs of patients often help to diagnose and establish the type of <b>anisocoria.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Causes of <b>anisocoria</b> {{range from}} benign (normal) to {{life-threatening}} conditions.Clinically, {{it is important}} to establish whether <b>anisocoria</b> is more apparent in dim or bright light: ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Anisocoria</b> {{which is}} greater in dim light {{suggests}} Horner's syndrome or mechanical <b>anisocoria.</b> In Horner's syndrome sympathetic fibers have a defect, therefore the pupil of the involved eye will not dilate in darkness.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anisocoria</b> {{refers to}} a common eye {{condition}} {{in which the two}} pupils differ in size. In mechanical <b>anisocoria,</b> this is the result of damage to the iris dilator muscle, which may be caused by trauma, angle-closure glaucoma, surgery such as cataract removal, or uveitis (inflammation of the eye). Slit lamp examination is often used as a diagnostic aid: damage to the dilator muscle is indicated by <b>anisocoria</b> when light intensity is lowered.|$|E
5000|$|Pharmacological agents {{will cause}} <b>anisocoria,</b> {{particularly}} if instilled in one eye. Some examples of pharmacological agents which {{may affect the}} pupils include pilocarpine, cocaine, tropicamide, MDMA, dextromethorphan, and ergolines. Alkaloids present in plants of the genera Brugmansia and Datura, such as scopolamine, may also induce <b>anisocoria.</b>|$|E
50|$|Thus, <b>anisocoria</b> {{means the}} {{condition}} of unequal pupil(s).|$|E
50|$|Alterations of {{the pupil}} light reflex, {{size of the}} pupil, and <b>anisocoria</b> (unequal pupils) are {{correlated}} with outcomes of patients with traumatic brain injury. Blood flow imaging has shown that pupil changes are highly correlated with brainstem oxygenation and perfusion, and <b>anisocoria</b> can be an indicator of a pathological process or neurological dysfunction.|$|E

50|$|Physiological <b>anisocoria</b> is when human pupils {{differ in}} size. It is {{generally}} considered to be benign, though it must be distinguished from Congenital Horner's syndrome, pharmacological dilatation or other conditions connected to the sympathetic nervous system.The prevalence of physiological <b>anisocoria</b> has not been found to be influenced by the sex, age, or iris color of the subject.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anisocoria</b> is the {{condition}} of one pupil being more dilated than the other.|$|E
50|$|A {{relative}} afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) {{also known}} as a Marcus Gunn pupil does not cause <b>anisocoria.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The main {{characteristic}} that distinguishes physiological <b>anisocoria</b> {{is an increase}} of pupil size with lower light or reduced illumination, such that the pupils differ in size between the two eyes. At any given eye examination, up to 41% of healthy patients can show an <b>anisocoria</b> of 0.4 mm or more {{at one time or}} another. It can also occur as the difference between both pupils varies from day to day. [...] A normal population survey showed that during poor light or near dark conditions, differences of 1 mm on average between pupils was found. The presence of physiologic <b>anisocoria</b> has been estimated at 20% of the normal population, so some degree of pupil difference may be expected in at least 1 in 5 clinic patients.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Anisocoria</b> {{which is}} greater in bright light {{suggests}} Adie tonic pupil, pharmacologic dilation, oculomotor nerve palsy, or damaged iris.|$|E

50|$|<b>Anisocoria</b> is {{a common}} condition, defined by a {{difference}} of 0.4 mm or more between the sizes of the pupils of the eyes.|$|E
50|$|The {{opposite}} condition, mydriasis, is the dilation of the pupil. <b>Anisocoria</b> is {{the condition}} of one pupil being more dilated than the other.|$|E
50|$|It {{should be}} {{considered}} an emergency if a patient develops acute onset <b>anisocoria.</b> These cases {{may be due to}} brain mass lesions which cause oculomotor nerve palsy. <b>Anisocoria</b> in the presence of confusion, decreased mental status, severe headache, or other neurological symptoms can forewarn a neurosurgical emergency. This is because a hemorrhage, tumor or another intracranial mass can enlarge to a size where the third cranial nerve (CN III) is compressed, which results in uninhibited dilatation of the pupil on the same side as the lesion.|$|E
50|$|The opposite, {{constriction}} of the pupil, {{is referred}} to as miosis. Both mydriasis and miosis can be physiological. <b>Anisocoria</b> is the condition of one pupil being more dilated than the other.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the causes}} of <b>anisocoria</b> are life-threatening, {{including}} Horner's syndrome (which may be due to carotid dissection) and oculomotor nerve palsy (due to a brain aneurysm, uncal herniation, or head trauma).|$|E
50|$|<b>Anisocoria</b> is a {{condition}} characterized by an unequal size of the eyes' pupils. Affecting 20% of the population, {{it can be an}} entirely harmless condition or a symptom of more serious medical problems.|$|E
5000|$|Physiological anisocoria: About 20% {{of normal}} {{people have a}} slight {{difference}} in pupil size which is known as physiological <b>anisocoria.</b> In this condition, the difference between pupils is usually less than 1 mm.|$|E
50|$|When <b>anisocoria</b> occurs and the {{examiner}} is unsure whether the abnormal pupil is the constricted or dilated one, if a one-sided ptosis is present then the abnormally sized pupil can be {{presumed to be}} {{on the side of the}} ptosis.|$|E
5000|$|... • In {{the season}} 10 Big Bang Theory Comic-Con special, Steve Molaro {{told a story}} about how he first met Judd Hirsch and was taken aback by his dilated pupil. One of the other writers {{researched}} it and discovered that Judd Hirsch suffers from <b>anisocoria.</b>|$|E
50|$|He {{was listed}} as second author on a paper {{published}} in The Journal of Neuroscience, which was featured briefly in episode 21 of a show on May 25, 2012 called My Pupils, explaining that his study of neuroscience of vision was motivated by his harmless <b>anisocoria</b> condition.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Anisocoria</b> is absent. A Marcus Gunn pupil is seen, {{among other}} conditions, in optic neuritis. It is also common in {{retrobulbar}} optic neuritis due to multiple sclerosis {{but only for}} 3-4 weeks, until the visual acuity begins to improve in 1-2 weeks and may return to normal.|$|E
50|$|When {{detected}} during childhood, {{without any}} other symptoms and when other disorders are discarded through clinical tests, {{it should be}} considered a developmental or genetic phenomenon.Asymmetric pupil or dyscoria, potential causes of <b>anisocoria,</b> refer to an abnormal shape of the pupil which can happens due to developmental and intrauterine anomalies.|$|E
50|$|Tonic pupils {{are fairly}} common - {{they are seen}} in roughly 1 out of every 500 people. A patient with <b>anisocoria</b> (one pupil bigger than the other) whose pupil does not react to light (does not constrict when exposed to bright light) most likely has Adie {{syndrome}} - idiopathic degeneration of the ciliary ganglion.|$|E
50|$|The {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of infection with feline leukemia virus are quite varied and include loss of appetite, poor coat condition, <b>anisocoria</b> (uneven pupils), infections of the skin, bladder, and respiratory tract, oral disease, seizures, lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes), skin lesions, fatigue, fever, weight loss, stomatitis, gingivitis, litter box avoidance, pancytopenia, recurring bacterial and viral illnesses, anemia, diarrhea and jaundice.|$|E
5000|$|A {{recent study}} {{published}} in the American Journal of Critical Care revealed that critical care and neurosurgical nurses consistently underestimated pupil size, were unable to identify <b>anisocoria,</b> and incorrectly assessed pupil reactivity. It concluded that automated pupillometry is a necessary tool for accuracy and consistency, and that it might facilitate earlier detection of subtle pupil changes, allowing more effective and timely diagnostic and treatment interventions.|$|E
50|$|Dejerine-Sottas {{disease is}} {{characterized}} by moderate to severe lower and upper extremity weakness and loss of sensation, which occur mainly in the lower legs, forearms, feet and hands. Loss of muscle mass and reduced muscle tone can occur as the disease progresses. Other symptoms may include pain in the extremities, curvature of the spine, clawed hands, foot deformities, ataxia, peripheral areflexia, and slow acquisition of motor skills in childhood. Symptoms that are less common can include limitation of eye movements, other eye problems such as nystagmus or <b>anisocoria,</b> or mild hearing loss.|$|E
5000|$|... 4-Hydroxyamphetamine {{is used in}} eye {{drops to}} dilate the pupil (a process called mydriasis) so that {{the back of the}} eye can be examined. This is a {{diagnostic}} test for Horner's Syndrome. Patients with Horner’s syndrome exhibit <b>anisocoria</b> brought about by lesions on the nerves that connect to the nasociliary branch of the ophthalmic nerve. Application of 4-hydroxyamphetamine to the eye can indicate whether the lesion is preganglionic or postganglionic based on the pupil’s response. If the pupil dilates, the lesion is preganglionic. If the pupil does not dilate, the lesion is postganglionic.|$|E
50|$|Apraclonidine may {{be useful}} in the {{diagnosis}} of Horner's syndrome. In Horner's syndrome, the sympathetic innervation to the pupillary dilator muscle is lost. The affected pupil is thus miotic and the pupillary dilator responds to denervation by increasing α1 receptors. Apraclonidine is useful in this case due to its weak α1-adrenergic properties. When applied to the denervated (and thus hyper-sensitive) pupillary dilator muscle, a super-normal dilatory response is generated in which the pupil dilates to a degree greater than that which would be seen in a non-denervated muscle. This causes the reversal of <b>anisocoria</b> that is characteristic of Horner's.|$|E
50|$|Common {{pathology}} {{referred to}} a neuro-ophthalmologist includes afferent visual system disorders (e.g. optic neuritis, optic neuropathy, papilledema, brain tumors or strokes) and efferent visual system disorders (e.g. <b>anisocoria,</b> diplopia, ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, nystagmus, blepharospasm, seizures of the eye or eye muscles, and hemifacial spasm). The largest international society of neuro-ophthalmologists is the North American Neuro-Ophthalmological Society (NANOS), which organizes an annual meeting and publishes the Journal of Neuro-Ophthalmology. Neuro-ophthalmologists are often faculty at large university-based medical centers. Patients often have co-existing disease in other fields (rheumatology, endocrinology, oncology, cardiology, etc.), thus the neuro-ophthalmologist is often a liaison between the ophthalmology department and other departments in the medical center.|$|E
