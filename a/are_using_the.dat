All ten DVB-T television channels are free-to-air and privately owned, except for HRT's channels and the Moja uprava channel (which are publicly owned broadcasters). Doma TV {{is part of the}} Nova TV group.

5|$|Local {{multiplayer}} {{allows the}} player to select which teams {{participate in the}} battle {{as well as the}} number of worms and handicaps, which options and weapons are used, and the level to be played on. The matches can use any combination of human and computer teams, provided at least one team is human. Additionally, multiple worm teams can form an alliance for the match by selecting the same team color – they will still operate separately in movement rotation but share weapons and score. If multiple human players <b>are</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> same computer, the game functions in a hotseat mode.|$|E

After some unsuccessful leads, he finally comes across Snake Jailbird, who tells him that the cola trucks are registered to the Springfield Museum of Natural History. Apu and Bart get to the museum, where they find a meteor as the source of the cola. They eavesdrop on a conversation between aliens Kang and Kodos, who are masterminding a scheme. Apu and Bart learn that the wasp cameras are filming the antics of Springfield for an intergalactic reality show, Foolish Earthlings. The aliens <b>are</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> cola to make people insane, by which time Kang and Kodos will distribute laser guns among the populace to drive the town to a violent massacre sure to draw many viewers.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Springfield Elementary {{put on a}} {{production}} of Casablanca, in which Lisa gets the lead role of Ilsa. Milhouse wants the male lead role of Rick because of his love for Lisa, but he is challenged by a new boy, Jack Deforest, who dresses, acts and speaks like Humphrey Bogart. Milhouse enlists the bullies to beat up Jack, but Jack wins the fight. Principal Skinner sees this violence and declares that Milhouse will play Rick instead of Jack; Lisa is angered as she {{does not believe that}} he is a good actor. Marge tells Lisa {{that it is important to}} encourage people who are not skilled by telling them that they <b>are,</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> example of Homer. The production is a success, but at the end it is revealed that Jack was disguised as Milhouse; he and Lisa leave hand-in-hand.|$|E
5|$|The {{four are}} being aided by local Ibizan Carmen (Leticia Dolera), who begins a {{relationship}} with Baxter. They soon realise they are still being hunted when their rental car explodes. Quinn is kidnapped by Mackenzie (David Warner), an elderly British expatriate who is revealed {{to be the leader}} of the drug operation. The four are forced to return the money in exchange for their lives. When they are €100 short from a speeding fine, Mackenzie makes the four produce fake ecstasy for a nightclub, at which point he allows them to return home with five million euros that were paid to them by the nightclub, though Carmen is left behind. Mackenzie tricks them into boarding a ferry for Morocco, where they are arrested and sent to a black site prison in the desert. After another attempt on their lives, they are informed that the drug operation was organised by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), who <b>are</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> operation to fund black operations, {{and as a result of}} the four's interference a kill contract is out against them. With assistance by the British government, they move to Cape Town, South Africa, to live new lives and identities to avoid CIA detection, though they are no longer allowed to contact each other or their families.|$|E
