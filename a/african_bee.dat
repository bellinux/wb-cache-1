25|$|African honeybees abscond (abandon {{the hive}} and any food store {{to start over}} in a new location) more readily than European honeybees. This is not {{necessarily}} a severe loss in tropical climates where plants bloom all year but in more temperate climates it can leave the colony with insufficient stores to survive the winter. Thus Africanized bees are expected to be a hazard mostly in the Southern States of the United States, reaching as far north as the Chesapeake Bay in the east. The cold-weather limits of the <b>African</b> <b>bee</b> have driven some professional bee breeders from Southern California into the harsher wintering locales of the northern Sierra Nevada and southern Cascade Range. This is a more difficult area to prepare bees for early pollination placement in, such as is required for the production of almonds. The reduced available winter forage in northern California means that bees must be fed for early spring buildup.|$|E

40|$|Colony defense by honey bees, Apis mellifera, is {{associated}} with stinging and mass attack, fueled by the release of alarm pheromones. Thus, alarm pheromones are critically important to survival of honey bee colonies. Here we report that in the parasitic relationship between the European honey bee and the small hive beetle, Aethina tumida, the honey bee's alarm pheromones serve a negative function because they are potent attractants for the beetle. Furthermore, we discovered that the beetles from both Africa and the United States vector a strain of Kodamaea ohmeri yeast, which produces these same honey bee alarm pheromones when grown on pollen in hives. The beetle is not a pest of <b>African</b> honey <b>bees</b> because <b>African</b> <b>bees</b> have evolved effective methods to mitigate beetle infestation. However, European honey bees, faced with disease and pest management stresses different from those experienced by <b>African</b> <b>bees,</b> are unable to effectively inhibit beetle infestation. Therefore, {{the environment of the}} European honey bee colony provides optimal conditions to promote the unique bee–beetle–yeast–pollen multitrophic interaction that facilitates effective infestation of hives {{at the expense of the}} European honey bee...|$|R

50|$|This {{opens up}} the {{possibility}} of social parasitism: if a female worker expressing the thelytokous phenotype from a Cape honey bee colony can enter a colony of A. m. scutellata, she can potentially take over that <b>African</b> <b>bee</b> colony. A behavioral consequence of the thelytoky phenotype is queen pheromonal mimicry, which means the parasitic workers can sneak their eggs in to be raised with those from the African bees, and their eggs aren't policed by the <b>African</b> <b>bee</b> workers because they're similar to the <b>African</b> <b>bee</b> queen's eggs. As a result the parasitic A. m. capensis workers increase in number within a host colony, while numbers of the A. m. scutellata workers that perform foraging duties (A. m. capensis workers are greatly under-represented in the foraging force of an infected colony) dwindle, owing to competition in egg laying between A. m. capensis workers and the queen, and to the eventual death of the queen. This causes {{the death of the}} colony upon which the capensis females depended, so they will then seek out a new host colony.|$|E

50|$|<b>African</b> <b>bees</b> are “precocious foragers;” A. mellifera scutellata bees begin {{foraging}} for pollen significantly {{earlier than}} their European counterparts A. mellifera ligustica, {{and this is}} thought {{to be related to the}} fact that African colonies have a younger, skewed age distribution by comparison. However, this is not a direct cause for the different subsistence strategies between the two subspecies.|$|R
50|$|A single <b>African</b> <b>bee</b> sting {{is no more}} venomous than {{a single}} European bee sting, though African honeybees respond more quickly when {{disturbed}} than do European honey bees. They send out {{three to four times}} as many workers in response to a threat. They will also pursue an intruder for a greater distance from the hive. Although people have {{died as a result of}} 100-300 stings, it has been estimated that the average lethal dose for an adult is 500-1100 bee stings. In terms of industrial honey production, the <b>African</b> <b>bee</b> produces far less honey than its European counterpart, whilst producing more swarms and absconding (abandoning its nest). For this reason, African races of Honeybees are less desirable than European races, except where the proclivity of African bees give beekeepers no other option due to the Africans' tendency to invade and take over European nests.|$|E
5000|$|The {{introduction}} of the Cape honey bee into northern South Africa {{poses a threat to}} African honey bees. If a female worker from a Cape honey bee colony enters an <b>African</b> <b>bee</b> nest, she is not attacked, partly due to her resemblance to the <b>African</b> <b>bee</b> queen. As she is capable of parthenogenetic reproduction, she may begin laying eggs which hatch as [...] "clones" [...] of herself, which will also lay eggs, causing the parasitic A. m. capensis workers to increase in number. The death of the host colony results from the dwindling numbers of A. m. scutellata workers that perform foraging duties (A. m. capensis workers are greatly under-represented in the foraging force), the death of the queen, and, before queen death, competition for egg laying between A. m. capensis workers and the queen. When the colony dies, the capensis females will seek out a new host colony.|$|E
50|$|In Spanish bee populations, mtDNA haplotypes of <b>African</b> <b>bee</b> strains {{were found}} to be {{frequently}} present (Smith 1991, Garnery et al 1995) (Cornuet et al 1975,1978, 1982, 1988; Ruttner 1988;Cornuet and Fresnaye 1989;Orante-Bermejos and Garcia-Fernandez 1995; Hepburn and Radloff 1996). Migrating bee populations formed the original colonies of bee in western Europe, landing to eventually populate the continent from Africa across the Straits of Gibraltar.|$|E

25|$|As the Africanized {{honeybee}} migrates further north, colonies {{continue to}} interbreed with European honeybees.

We anticipate increased pressure from the public to ban beekeeping in urban and suburban areas. This action would be counter-productive. Beekeepers maintaining managed colonies of domestic European bees are our best defense against an area becoming saturated with AHB.

40|$|The {{accidental}} release of 26 <b>African</b> honey <b>bee</b> queens (Apis mellifera scutellata) in Brazil in 1957 {{was the beginning}} of the Africanization process of honey bees in South America. This was highly impacting on beekeeping across the continent, because, despite being more productive, <b>African</b> honey <b>bees</b> were very aggressive. Many attempts to cross European x <b>African</b> <b>bees</b> were done in order to obtain less aggressive bees (Michener, 1975). There are slight morphological differences between African and European honeybees. In terms of beekeeping management, however, behavioral differences are more important. Besides stinging, another important difference is hygienic behavior. African honeybees are known to be more effective in eliminating dead larvae and pupae than their European counterparts (Guzman-Novoa et al., 1999). Despite the Africanization, there are still regions with a predominance of European subspecies. For example, in Argentina, there was a significant introduction of European subspecies in highly saturated Africanized honey bee regions in order to slow down the Africanization process. This provided more European gene frequency i...|$|R
50|$|These two {{strategies}} {{have been adopted}} by the European and <b>African</b> <b>bees</b> respectively. European bees must survive the winter, an annual event with predictable mortality outcomes. Trying to meet the energetic needs of the colony and reproduction might decrease their overall survival during the winter and it is more evolutionarily favorable for them to store nectar and honey. <b>African</b> <b>bees</b> are more vulnerable to less predictable times of scarcity or attack and it is therefore to their advantage to produce as many young as possible, increasing the likelihood that some or even many will survive. Such circumstances would have favored the worker bees who preferred harvesting nectar in European colonies and pollen in African colonies, providing an explanation for how a divergence in worker behavior and age distribution evolved in Apis mellifera scutellata and Apis mellifera ligustica. Fewell and Bertram’s study is significant in that it provides a plausible method through which the fitness characteristics of the subspecies could have evolved from {{a small number of}} behavioral differences in worker bees.|$|R
50|$|Prospective beekeepers {{from rural}} areas, {{generally}} {{between the ages}} of 18 - 26, spend 18 months in an incubation programme, during which time they are officially employed by the incubator as salaried working interns. During their incubation, the interns complete an <b>African</b> Honey <b>Bee</b> developed program in beekeeping. They work under guidance of senior beekeepers on an <b>African</b> Honey <b>Bee</b> commercial bee farm. The interns are also assisted to start their own beekeeping business on a small scale, with the view of increasing it once they complete the incubation process. At the end of their incubation, the beekeepers automatically become shareholders in <b>African</b> Honey <b>Bee</b> Kruger Park (Pty) Ltd, the main operating entity of the group, through a stakeholder Trust.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} noted that A. mellifera scutellata have higher rates of colony growth, reproduction, and {{swarming}} than European honey bees (A. mellifera ligustica and A. mellifera mellifera), a fitness advantage {{that allowed them to}} become an invasive species. A study by Fewell and Bertram was conducted to understand the source of these differences. The differences in fitness strategy were thought to be accounted for by the fact that African worker bees have a greater preference for pollen over nectar, which is a direct food resource for the emerging brood. Another important factor was thought to be differences between the species in age polyethism, or the allotment of different tasks as a honey bee ages. Young worker bees focus on in-hive assistance such as brood care, and the relatively younger <b>African</b> <b>bee</b> populations were thought to be one explanation for the emphasis on reproduction and colony expansion in the species. The study was also interested in the role different colony social environments and different genetic variation might play in the fitness discrepancies between the two sub-species.|$|E
