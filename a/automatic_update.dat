500|$|Windows 10 Home is {{permanently}} set {{to download}} all updates automatically, including cumulative updates, security patches, and drivers, and users cannot individually select updates to install or not. Microsoft offers a diagnostic tool {{that can be}} used to hide updates and prevent them from being reinstalled, but only after they had been already installed, then uninstalled without rebooting the system. Tom Warren of The Verge felt that, given web browsers such as Google Chrome had already adopted such an <b>automatic</b> <b>update</b> system, such a requirement would help to keep all Windows10 devices secure, and felt that [...] "if you're used to family members calling you for technical support because they've failed to upgrade to the latest Windows service pack or some malware disabled Windows Update then those days will hopefully be over." ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{the release}} of Windows ME in 2000, Microsoft {{introduced}} <b>Automatic</b> <b>Updates</b> {{as a replacement for}} the Critical Update Notification tool. Unlike its predecessor, <b>Automatic</b> <b>Updates</b> includes the ability to download and install updates without using a web browser. [...] Instead of the five-minute schedule used by its predecessor, the <b>Automatic</b> <b>Updates</b> client checks the Windows Update servers once a day. [...] The user is given the option to download available updates then prompt the user to install them, or to notify the user prior to downloading any available updates. [...] After Windows Me is installed, the user is prompted via a notification balloon to configure the <b>Automatic</b> <b>Updates</b> client.|$|R

50|$|Another {{characteristic}} of round-trip engineering is <b>automatic</b> <b>update</b> of the artifacts {{in response to}} automatically detected inconsistencies. In that sense, it is different from forward- and reverse engineering which can be both manual (traditionally) and automatic (via automatic generation or analysis of the artifacts). The <b>automatic</b> <b>update</b> can be either instantaneous or on-demand. In instantaneous RTE, all related artifacts are immediately updated after each change made to one of them. In on-demand RTE, authors of the artifacts may concurrently evolve the artifacts (even in a distributed setting) {{and at some point}} choose to execute matching to identify inconsistencies and choose to propagate some of them and reconcile potential conflicts.|$|E

40|$|Solid-State Drives (SSDs) are {{data storage}} devices that use {{solid-state}} memory to store persistent data. Flash memory is {{the de facto}} nonvolatile technology used in most SSDs. It {{is well known that}} the writing performance of flash-based SSDs is much lower than the reading performance {{due to the fact that}} a flash page can be written only after it is erased. In this work, we present an SSD cache architecture designed to provide a balanced read/write performance for flash memory. An efficient <b>automatic</b> <b>updating</b> technique is proposed to provide a more responsive SSD architecture by writing back stable but dirty flash pages according to a predetermined set of policies during the SSD device idle time. Those <b>automatic</b> <b>updating</b> policies are also tested and compared. Simulation results demonstrate that both read-ing and writing performance are improved significantly by incorporating the proposed cache with <b>automatic</b> <b>updating</b> feature into SSDs...|$|R
