The handle is made out of four different metals including gold and silver, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> possible that it belonged to Sviatoslav himself.|$|E
5|$|The Mysore Zoo, {{established}} in 1892, the Karanji, Kukkarahalli and the Blue Lagoon Lake are popular recreational destinations. Blue Lagoon {{which is a}} lake with a mini island is located behind KRS water Dam <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> mesmerising {{to be there and}} watch the sunset and sunrise. The colour of the water and the sky is Blue and there is a mini island in the middle due to which it was named as Blue Lagoon. Mysuru has the Regional Museum of Natural History, the Folk Lore Museum, the Railway Museum and the Oriental Research Institute. The city is a centre for yoga-related health tourism that attracts domestic and foreign visitors, particularly those who, for years, came to study with the late ashtanga yoga guru K. Pattabhi Jois.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{majority}} of Trollope's triangles, Mary is not called upon to judge between a good suitor and a bad one, but between two good men. Gilmore {{is presented as a}} sympathetic and admirable character; the reader learns far less about Captain Marrable's character, and is given no reason why Mary should prefer him to his rival. To Trollope, a woman does not necessarily fall in love because of a man's merits; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> wrong for a woman to marry where she does not love, regardless of her suitor's worthy qualities.|$|E
30|$|The {{specific}} {{surface area of}} WSAC was 2, 030  m 2 /g, the average pore size was 1.62  nm, micropore <b>was</b> developed, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> beneficial for adsorption of hydrogen sulphide.|$|R
30|$|The [tax] system sort of functioned, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{extremely}} hard to use. So it wasn’t easy: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> expensive {{for people to}} comply, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> much a one-size-fits-all approach. It wasn’t a very personalized approach.|$|R
50|$|Hypatia was {{originally}} serialised in 1852 in Fraser's Magazine from January 1852 to April 1853, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> then published in book form in 1853. The book {{was translated into}} several European languages, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> successful in Germany.|$|R
5|$|The {{toxic dose}} of {{paracetamol}} is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4grams. Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10grams or 200mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, {{have a reasonable}} likelihood of causing toxicity. Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24hours exceed these levels. Following a normal dose of 1gram of paracetamol {{four times a day}} for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in alanine transaminase in their liver to typically about three times the normal value. It is unlikely that this dose would lead to liver failure. Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days. In adults, a dose of 6grams a day over the preceding 48hours could potentially lead to toxicity, while in children acute doses above 200mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity. Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.|$|E
5|$|The subfamilies of Dromaeosauridae {{frequently}} {{shift in}} content based on new analysis, but typically consist {{of the following}} groups. A number of dromaeosaurids have not been assigned to any particular subfamily, often because they are too poorly preserved to be placed confidently in phylogenetic analysis (see section Phylogeny below), or because they are basal relative to the primary subdivisions of Dromaeosauridae (Mahakala, for example, is the most primitive known dromaeosaurid and falls outside any named sub-group). The most basal subfamily of dromaeosaurids is often {{found to be the}} Unenlagiinae. This enigmatic group is the most poorly supported subfamily of dromaeosaurids and it is possible that some or all of its members belong outside of Dromaeosauridae. The larger, ground-dwelling members like Buitreraptor and Unenlagia show strong flight adaptations, although they were probably too large to 'take off'. One member of this group, Rahonavis, is very small, with well-developed wings that show evidence of quill knobs (the attachment points for flight feathers) <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> likely that it could fly. The next most primitive clade of dromaeosaurids is the Microraptoria. This group includes many of the smallest dromaeosaurids, which show adaptations for living in trees. All known dromaeosaurid skin impressions hail from this group and all show an extensive covering of feathers and well-developed wings. Like the unenlagiines, some species may have been capable of active flight. The subfamily Velociraptorinae has traditionally included Velociraptor, Deinonychus, and Saurornitholestes, and while the discovery of Tsaagan lent support to this grouping, the inclusion of Saurornitholestes is still uncertain. The Dromaeosaurinae is usually found to consist of medium to giant-sized species, with generally box-shaped skulls (the other subfamilies generally have narrower snouts).|$|E
25|$|A serious {{sampling}} problem {{exists for}} counting craters on the intermediate plains unit, because {{those in the}} diameter range of 50 to 150nbsp&km commonly occur in clusters, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> difficult to determine which craters of a cluster are younger than the surrounding plains unit and which are older.|$|E

25|$|Club {{work began}} {{wherever}} a public-spirited person {{did something to}} give rural children respect {{for themselves and their}} ways of life <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> difficult to credit one sole individual. Instances of work with rural boys and girls can be found all throughout the 19th century. In the spring of 1882, Delaware College announced a statewide corn contest for boys, in which each boy was to plant a quarter of an acre, according to instructions sent out from the college, and cash prizes, certificates, and subscriptions to the American Agriculturalist were rewarded.|$|E

25|$|Although not {{particularly}} high, these mountains are rugged {{and should not}} be underestimated. Severe weather conditions in the North Shore Mountains often contrast dramatically with mild conditions in nearby Vancouver. This is especially true in winter, but even in summer, large precipices are hidden very close to popular hiking trails <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> easy to get lost, despite being in sight of the city. Those who venture into the North Shore Mountains for whatever reason should be well prepared at any time of year.|$|E
25|$|The {{attractiveness}} of a constructed wetlands solution {{lies in its}} relative low cost. They are limited by the metal loads they can deal with (either from high flows or metal concentrations), though current practitioners have succeeded in developing constructed wetlands that treat high volumes (see description of Campbell Mine constructed wetland) and/or highly acidic water (with adequate pre-treatment). Typically, the effluent from constructed wetland receiving near-neutral water will be well-buffered at between 6.5-7.0 and can readily be discharged. Some of metal precipitates retained in sediments are unstable when exposed to oxygen (e.g., copper sulfide or elemental selenium), <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> important that the wetland sediments remain largely or permanently submerged.|$|E
25|$|Merfyn married Nest ferch Cadell, {{the sister}} of Cyngen ap Cadell, the King of Powys, and founded {{what was to become}} known as the House of Aberffraw which was named after his {{principal}} court at Aberffraw on Anglesey. No written records are preserved from the Britons of southern Scotland and northern England <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> likely that Merfyn Frych brought many of these legends as well as his pedigree with him when he came to north Wales. It appears most probable that it was at Merfyn's court that all the lore of the north was collected and written down during his reign and that of his son.|$|E

25|$|How might {{climate change}} have other effects that {{indirectly}} shape energy {{production and consumption}} in the United States? The research evidence about indirect effects ranges from abundant information about possible {{effects of climate change}} policies on energy technology choices to extremely limited information about such issues as effects on energy security. Based on this mixed evidence, it appears that climate change is likely to affect risk management in the investment behavior of some energy institutions, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> likely to have some effects on energy technology R investments and energy resource and technology choices. In addition, climate change can be expected to affect other countries in ways that in turn affect U.S. energy conditions through their participation in global and hemispheric energy markets, and climate change concerns could interact with some driving forces behind policies focused on U.S. energy security.|$|E
25|$|Probably {{the oldest}} front vise design is the leg vise. It's called a leg vise {{because one of}} the bench's legs is an {{integral}} part of it - usually forming the inside jaw. The outside jaw also goes all the way to the floor - or nearly so. There is a single screw mounted between a quarter and a third of the way down that goes through both jaws with the nut on the back of the leg. Finally, there is some sort of horizontal beam at the bottom to act as a fulcrum. This beam may take the form of a board that can be adjusted by means of holes and pegs, or it can even be another screw. The leg vise is probably the simplest and least expensive of the front vises, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> strong.|$|E

50|$|Ernst Neumann-Neander {{founded the}} Neander Motorfahrzeug GmbH Düren-Rölsdorf in Düren in 1926. He {{designed}} the futuristic Neander-Rahmen (Neander frame), {{which was made}} from box-section Duralumin and had a unique design of pivoted front fork. From 1928 Opel also manufactured the same frame under licence, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> successful in motorcycle racing. Neander's own factory produced about 2,000 motorcycles before production ceased {{some time in the}} 1930s.|$|R
25|$|Not all {{methods of}} opening the zona pellucida have the same success rate because the {{well-being}} of the embryo and/or blastomere may be impacted by the procedure used for the biopsy. Zona drilling with acid Tyrode's solution (ZD) was looked at in comparison to partial zona dissection (PZD) to determine which technique would lead to more successful pregnancies and have less of an effect on the embryo and/or blastomere. ZD uses a digestive enzyme like pronase which makes it a chemical drilling method. The chemicals used in ZD may have a damaging effect on the embryo. PZD uses a glass microneedle to cut the zona pellucida which makes it a mechanical dissection method that typically needs skilled hands to perform the procedure. In a study that included 71 couples, ZD was performed in 26 cycles from 19 couples and PZD was performed in 59 cycles from 52 couples. In the single cell analysis, there was a success rate of 87.5% in the PZD group and 85.4% in the ZD group. The maternal age, number of oocytes retrieved, fertilization rate, and other variables did not differ between the ZD and PZD groups. It was found that PZD led to a significantly higher rate of pregnancy (40.7% vs 15.4%), ongoing pregnancy (35.6% vs 11.5%), and implantation (18.1% vs 5.7%) than ZD. This suggests that using the mechanical method of PZD in blastomere biopsies for preimplantation genetic diagnosis may be more proficient than using the chemical method of ZD. The success of PZD over ZD could be attributed to the chemical agent in ZD having a harmful effect on the embryo and/or blastomere. Currently, zona drilling using a laser is the predominant method {{of opening the}} zona pellucida. Using a laser is an easier technique than using mechanical or chemical means. However, laser drilling could be harmful to the embryo <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> expensive for in vitro fertilization laboratories to use especially when PGD is not a prevalent process as of modern times. PZD could be a viable alternative to these issues.|$|E
