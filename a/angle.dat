5|$|In {{the main}} event, John Cena faced Kurt <b>Angle</b> for the WWE Championship. The match began with <b>Angle</b> and Cena locking up, leading to <b>Angle</b> taking Cena {{down with a}} {{headlock}} takeover. Cena countered many attacks by <b>Angle</b> {{and was able to}} reverse the ankle lock. Cena attempted an FU but <b>Angle</b> delivered an <b>Angle</b> Slam. Eric Bischoff came down the ramp and cheered for <b>Angle,</b> who had the Ankle Lock applied on Cena. Cena rolled out of the move, grabbed the championship belt, which Bischoff had brought with him, and hit <b>Angle</b> with it. The referee saw this and called for the bell. As a result, Cena was disqualified for hitting <b>Angle</b> with the championship, ultimately resulting in him retaining his title. After the match, <b>Angle</b> attacked Cena until Cena delivered an FU through the Spanish announce table on <b>Angle.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first {{featured}} bout was {{a standard}} match between Kurt <b>Angle</b> and John Cena. <b>Angle</b> began bleeding internally after Cena performed a DDT {{on the ring}} apron on him. Later in the match, Cena attempted a FU but <b>Angle</b> reversed it into an unsuccessful cover attempt. Following that, <b>Angle</b> attempted an <b>Angle</b> Slam but Cena countered the maneuver. Cena later gave <b>Angle</b> an FU for a near fall and <b>Angle</b> gave Cena an <b>Angle</b> Slam for a near fall. <b>Angle</b> then countered Cena and applied an ankle lock, which led to Cena submitting.|$|E
5|$|A Falls Count Anywhere {{match between}} Kurt <b>Angle</b> and Abyss followed, lasting 17 minutes. At {{one point during}} the {{encounter}} while Abyss {{was standing on the}} concrete floor and <b>Angle</b> was on the stage, <b>Angle</b> performed a running leap off the stage into a somersault senton, connecting with Abyss on the floor. <b>Angle</b> was the victor in the bout, after throwing Abyss off of a scaffold through the Spanish announcers' table, then descending and covering Abyss for the pinfall.|$|E

5|$|A contact <b>angle</b> {{less than}} 90° (low contact <b>angle)</b> usually {{indicates}} that wetting {{of the surface}} is very favorable, and the fluid will spread over a large area of the surface. Contact angles greater than 90° (high contact <b>angle)</b> generally means that wetting of the surface is unfavorable, so the fluid will minimize contact with the surface and form a compact liquid droplet.|$|E
5|$|A.J. Styles and Kurt <b>Angle</b> {{went on to}} {{face each}} other in a Last Man Standing match at Hard Justice. This bout was {{announced}} on the July31 episode of Impact!, when Styles challenged <b>Angle</b> to a match at Hard Justice to end their rivalry. This was due to <b>Angle</b> assaulting Styles from behind earlier in the episode. Styles defeated <b>Angle</b> at the event.|$|E
5|$|A.J. Styles fought Kurt <b>Angle</b> in a Last Man Standing match next. In a Last Man Standing match, {{there are}} no {{disqualifications}} or count outs, instead to win the match the competitor has to force their opponent to {{not be able to}} reach a standing position by the count of 10. However, this match was only promoted as a Last Man Standing match, instead it was held under Texas Death match rules where a wrestler must pin or submit their opponent and then have them fail to respond to a count of 10. Styles got the first fall of the night, when he forced <b>Angle</b> to tap out to Angle's own signature submission maneuver the Ankle lock. <b>Angle</b> made it to his feet before the count concluded. <b>Angle</b> gained a pinfall later on in the match after slamming Styles off the top of a padded turnbuckle with a suplex. Before Styles could reach his feet to beat the count, <b>Angle</b> slammed Styles onto the mat back-first with his signature Olympic slam maneuver and gained another pinfall to start the count over. Styles beat that count as well, with <b>Angle</b> trying for the Olympic Slam again before Styles' countered it into his signature Styles' Clash maneuver and pinned <b>Angle.</b> After <b>Angle</b> reached his feet, Styles and <b>Angle</b> fought up a padded turnbuckle with Styles gaining the advantage. At this time, Styles grabbed <b>Angle</b> by the neck and fell backwards from the turnbuckle and drove <b>Angle</b> head-first into the mat. <b>Angle</b> failed to reach the 10 count afterwards, with Styles being declared the winner of the contest at 24 minutes and 50 seconds. Following the encounter, the referee called for medical attention for <b>Angle</b> who was scripted to appear as if he had suffered a neck injury. Styles then entered the ring once <b>Angle</b> reached his feet and lifted <b>Angle</b> up and dropped him on his head. As Styles walked up the ramp, he was attacked by Sting, who drove Styles' head into the ramp with his signature Scorpion Death Drop maneuver, as Kevin Nash looked on.|$|E

5|$|A.J. Styles fought Kurt <b>Angle</b> in {{the sixth}} {{encounter}} of the show next. The match lasted 22 minutes and 44 seconds. <b>Angle</b> was accompanied by Tomko to the ring. The referee forced Tomko {{to head to the}} backstage area due to the referee believing he would interfere. Styles attempted to perform his signature Styles Clash maneuver on <b>Angle,</b> which <b>Angle</b> countered into his signature Ankle Lock submission hold. Styles escaped the hold, causing <b>Angle</b> to crash into the referee, knocking him out in the storyline. Karen <b>Angle</b> then ran down to the ringside area and attempted to hand <b>Angle</b> a steel chair. Once <b>Angle</b> grabbed the chair she refused to release, allowing Styles to grab <b>Angle</b> and perform the Styles Clash by slamming <b>Angle</b> face-first into the mat. Styles then followed with the pin attempt to win the contest. After the encounter, <b>Angle</b> and Tomko assaulted Styles.|$|E

5|$|Another bout advertised for {{the event}} was <b>Angle</b> versus Abyss in a Falls Count Anywhere match. At Bound for Glory IV, <b>Angle</b> lost to TNA founder and {{on-screen}} co-owner Jeff Jarrett with Foley as Special Guest Enforcer. On the Impact! after Bound for Glory IV, <b>Angle</b> challenged Jarrett to another match at Turning Point, however, Jarrett refused. Angered by Jarrett's refusal, <b>Angle</b> began assaulting several wrestlers in TNA to persuade Jarrett into accepting the challenge. On the October 23 episode of Impact!, <b>Angle</b> challenged Jarrett again to a rematch, which Jarrett again refused. Jarrett, however, recommended Abyss as Angle's opponent, who was a casualty of Angle's attacks the previous week. On the October 30 episode of Impact!, <b>Angle</b> fought Abyss in a contest which ended in a disqualification after <b>Angle</b> struck Abyss with a steel chair. Following their encounter, a match was promoted pitting <b>Angle</b> against Abyss in a Falls Count Anywhere match at Turning Point.|$|E
5|$|Another {{encounter}} {{connected to}} the narrative that was advertised for Turning Point was Kurt <b>Angle</b> versus Abyss in a Falls Count Anywhere match. After <b>Angle</b> lost to Jeff Jarrett at Bound for Glory IV, <b>Angle</b> challenged Jarrett to a rematch, which was refused on the October16 episode of Impact!. To get Jarrett to accept his challenge, <b>Angle</b> assaulted several wrestlers in TNA. On the October23 episode of Impact!, <b>Angle</b> challenged Jarrett to a rematch for the second time. Jarrett refused the offer for a second time, but recommended a casualty of Angle's attacks, Abyss, as Angle's opponent. On the October30 episode of Impact!, a contest between <b>Angle</b> and Abyss ended in a disqualification after <b>Angle</b> struck Abyss with a steel chair. Following their encounter, a match was promoted pitting <b>Angle</b> against Abyss in a Falls Count Anywhere match at Turning Point. <b>Angle</b> won the bout at the show.|$|E
5|$|Another {{featured}} bout on the undercard pitted Kurt <b>Angle</b> against John Cena. On the September 18 {{episode of}} SmackDown, <b>Angle</b> lost an Iron Man match to Brock Lesnar for the WWE Championship. The match marked {{the third time}} that <b>Angle</b> defended the title against Lesnar with the first being WrestleMania XIX where Lesnar won the title and the second being SummerSlam which <b>Angle</b> retained. The next week on SmackDown, <b>Angle</b> tried to call Lesnar out to the ring, demanding a rematch, but instead Cena came to the ring and attacked <b>Angle.</b> On the October 2 episode of SmackDown, two of the primary rivalries on SmackDown intertwined in a tag team match, where Lesnar and Cena faced the team of <b>Angle</b> and the Undertaker, which Cena and Lesnar won after Cena struck <b>Angle</b> with a chain. The next week on SmackDown, a rap battle took place between Cena and <b>Angle,</b> in which both men performed raps insulting each other.

5|$|Following Turning Point, A.J. Styles {{tried to}} unite Christian's Coalition and The <b>Angle</b> Alliance. On the December 6, 2007 episode of Impact, Christian Cage became {{leader of a}} joint alliance, until Kurt <b>Angle</b> and Robert Roode {{attacked}} him {{at the end of}} the episode. This led to <b>Angle</b> defending the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Cage at TNA's Final Resolution PPV event on January 6, 2008. There, <b>Angle</b> defeated Cage after Styles attacked Cage, effectively siding with The <b>Angle</b> Alliance. The two fought again for the title at TNA's Against All Odds PPV event on February 10, 2008, where Tomko cost Cage the title, siding with The <b>Angle</b> Alliance as well.|$|E
