5|$|An {{alternate}} ending {{was present}} in the behind-the-scenes video, showing an exhausted Madonna leaving the party with a male model, as well as aftermath scenes of the party which were released in the first teaser trailer. The parting shot showed Madonna running <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> posing {{in front of the}} windows overlooking New York. Other scenes included Madonna chatting with Ora and Rock in-between takes, sitting in the hallways, plunging towards the neon sock puppets multiple times as well as singing the song with the little girls {{from the beginning of the}} video. Another video set to Kleinenberg's remix featured further footage of Madonna dancing and more casual scenes featuring the guest stars.|$|E
25|$|The {{video is}} {{shot in a}} grey room, where Yonezu wearing a flower wreath and long hair {{covering}} his face sits down to read a picture book. The picture book illustrates the song, showing pictures of two hands {{on top of each}} other, and a couple separated in every moment of their lives by a glass pane. Yonezu walks <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> finds holes in the room, with light shining through them. Further along there is a barren tree, with the lyrics of the song hanging on it. Yonezu sits under the tree with the book. The girl in the picture book leaves the drawings, leaving the male character alone. Yonezu starts to frantically claw at the holes of light, and falls down. On {{the other side of the}} holes of light, Yonezu performs the song with a band and an orchestra.|$|E
2500|$|Suspension can {{alternatively}} {{create a}} sense of liberation in that one can [...] "fly" [...] <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> some styles of rigging are optimal for the suspendee to have control over their spin rate, body position, and general activities. Trance-like states are also common, resulting alternatively or simultaneously from the sensations of 'anti-gravity", the heightened awareness of one's body, and the sacrifice of one's natural physical strengths.|$|E
30|$|These {{systems would}} {{establish}} embodiment through {{the visual and}} vestibular systems <b>and</b> through walking <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> interacting with objects <b>and</b> spaces in <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Interventions could ask users to alter spatial properties to accomplish some task and would engage aspects of spatial cognition related to the perception of angles, distances, and directions that are constructed based {{on the state of}} the body.|$|R
60|$|Ludwig Miller looked <b>around</b> <b>the</b> little <b>room</b> <b>and</b> then at Seaman. Dominey {{affected}} to misunderstand his hesitation.|$|R
50|$|Brandon, {{unaware of}} the rumors about a teacher, bumps into Elizabeth Jacobs, a girl from St. Lucius. It quickly becomes {{apparent}} that the rumors about a teacher are actually about Elizabeth who has followed Jeremiah from St. Lucius. Brandon and Elizabeth quickly bond as they go <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> coax <b>the</b> residents to continue partying {{as there is no}} threat of a teacher.|$|R
2500|$|According to {{disc jockey}} Jimmy Savile, McCartney wrote [...] "Paperback Writer" [...] in {{response}} to a request from an aunt who asked if he could [...] "write a single that wasn't about love". Savile said, [...] "With that thought obviously still in his mind, he walked <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> noticed that Ringo was reading a book. He took one look and announced that he would write a song about a book." [...] In a 2007 interview, McCartney recalled that he started writing the song after reading in the Daily Mail about an aspiring author, possibly Martin Amis. The Daily Mail was Lennon's regular newspaper and copies were in Lennon's Weybridge home when Lennon and McCartney were writing songs.|$|E
2500|$|The same {{daughter}} who allegedly saw the ghost on the staircase also reported seeing two phantom men apparently fighting on another staircase {{on the southwest}} side earlier in the 19th century. [...] Early in the 20th century, she also reported an [...] "immensely evil" [...] presence in the southwest bedroom, moving <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> then leaning over the bed. [...] In the same room, a visitor to the house once observed a floating hand, not attached to any arm, attaching itself to her four-poster bed and {{moving up and down}} it. [...] Another visitor later reported an identical experience, and also reported that the bed seemed to be shaking during the encounter. [...] The southwest side of the building was apparently a focus for paranormal activity: strange noises, objects being moved, dresses being cut with regular patterns of holes, and doors opening and shutting were all reported there.|$|E
60|$|The costermonger was next. Brooks looked <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> at the clock.|$|E
50|$|The Vault {{which is}} an in-game {{showroom}} {{of some of the}} main characters and equipment that will be found in the game. The user is free to roam <b>around</b> <b>the</b> vault's <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> find details on the game's factions and setting.|$|R
60|$|Louis {{disappeared}} from <b>the</b> <b>room</b> for <b>the</b> moment. I heard the outer door softly opened and closed. Then {{he came back}} into the sitting-room, followed by the man who had stood by our side at Charing Cross Station. <b>The</b> latter looked <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> quickly, <b>and</b> seemed disappointed to find it empty.|$|R
50|$|Lee {{orders the}} men to look for Noh, who is busy {{spilling}} kerosene all <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms,</b> passageways <b>and</b> corridors of the bunker.

60|$|She looked <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> {{drew him}} {{a little closer to}} her.|$|E
60|$|More at her ease now {{she glanced}} <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> back at him. He smiled.|$|E
60|$|She cast a half-appealing {{look at his}} face--a half-frightened one <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> at {{the open}} door beyond.|$|E
60|$|Uncle John gazed {{across the}} lobby reflectively. The stranger's eyes roved {{carelessly}} <b>around</b> <b>the</b> big <b>room</b> <b>and</b> then {{he moved with}} deliberate steps toward their corner. He passed several vacant chairs and settees on his way and finally paused before a lounging-chair not six feet distant from the one occupied by Mr. Merrick.|$|R
50|$|Early {{works by}} Olafur consist of {{oscillating}} electric fans {{hanging from the}} ceiling. Ventilator (1997) swings {{back and forth and}} around, rotating on its axis. Quadrible light ventilator mobile (2002-2007) is a rotating electrically powered mobile comprising a searchlight and four fans blowing air <b>around</b> <b>the</b> exhibition <b>room</b> <b>and</b> scanning it with the light cone.|$|R
50|$|The battle {{graphics}} use {{the same}} background effects as the previous two games in series, {{but this time the}} camera can turn 360 degrees <b>around</b> <b>the</b> battle <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> characters can run while battling. As in the past two games, combat utilizes a turn-based system, but this can be modified on a battle-by-battle basis.|$|R
60|$|Then he {{drew back}} and looked <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> {{the sight of the}} {{assembled}} company quite amazed him.|$|E
60|$|Again {{her eyes}} {{travelled}} <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> the terror in them leaped up at {{sight of the}} other bunk.|$|E
60|$|She had {{not thought}} of Clarence. She turned hurriedly, glanced <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> then peered down the dark stairway.|$|E
60|$|DEAR HOWELLS,--Mrs. Clemens {{has been}} sick abed for near two weeks, but is up <b>and</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> now, <b>and</b> gaining.

We are {{promising}} ourselves a whole world of pleasure in the visit, and you mustn't dream of disappointing us.|$|R
60|$|Gabriel rose swiftly, and {{disappeared}} behind the screen. As he did so, the door softly opened, {{and a man}} stepped into the cabin. The new-comer cast a rapid glance <b>around</b> <b>the</b> dimly-lighted <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> then remained motionless in the doorway. From behind the screen came the sound of voices. The stranger hesitated, and then uttered a slight cough.|$|R
50|$|Prospero and Ariel {{use their}} magic {{to create an}} {{elaborate}} masque <b>around</b> <b>the</b> frozen Alonso and the others. Sailors dance <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> frantically, <b>and</b> Miranda and Ferdinand appear in wedding attire. Prospero awakens Alonso and the others from stasis, reuniting Ferdinand with his father, and forgives the others for their past betrayals. The Goddess appears and sings a rendition of “Stormy Weather” while everyone looks on.|$|R
60|$|She looked <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> {{recognised}} {{some of her}} friends. For {{some reason}} or other she felt remarkably light-hearted.|$|E
60|$|The {{door opened}} slowly. It was the French maid who stood there. She looked <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> beckoned to the dog.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, I {{am ready}} now. Take the lamp, {{and carry it}} <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> hold it {{opposite}} any little opening you can find." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{information}} related to the user actual and previous position {{is a very important}} issue for research activities on new interaction paradigms navigating physical spaces. This information is obtained from a coherent use of infrared TXs and a developed software which computes the probability that the user is located and oriented in a specic way. A number of IR TXs are xed to walls <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms,</b> <b>and</b> an IR receiver is attached to the user handing a PDA. The received signals are then processed, on the PDA, to derive the user's location and orientation. Combinations of IR TXs can be used to discover location, distance and orientation. A standalone C++ application on the PDA, called Barriera, reads IR codes and processes the stream of codes to remove spurious readings. Hence Barriera does a probabilistic calculation on the readings to infer the orientation and location of the user. ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Bull", {{brought in}} his youth to watch {{football}} practices by his owner, high school student Bob Day who lived near the Yale Bowl, ascended to office when Handsome Dan IV died. A great success, he loved public appearances and the adulation of crowds, was a familiar figure <b>around</b> <b>the</b> locker <b>rooms,</b> <b>and</b> joined <b>the</b> team {{on a trip to}} Princeton University.|$|R

6000|$|... "Don't talk of dying, Harvey," [...] {{said the}} spinster, glancing her eye <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> pushing the {{wood in the}} fire to obtain a light from the blaze.|$|E
60|$|Trent woke {{from his}} day-dream into the present. He looked <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> saw that no papers had been omitted. Then he glanced keenly into his clerk's face.|$|E
50|$|The {{characters}} can {{traverse the}} game world in numerous ways. In some levels they are inflated with helium, requiring the player to tilt the console {{to guide them}} as they float <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Lil <b>and</b> Laarg usually move relatively slowly {{and in order to}} avoid fast-moving traps the player must grab the characters and pull them quickly to safety by pinching the Vita, touching both the front and rear panels at once.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} a control <b>room</b> {{incorporates}} ergonomic <b>and</b> aesthetic features including optimum traffic flow, acoustics, illumination, and {{health and safety of}} the workers. Ergonomic considerations determine the placement of humans and equipment to ensure that operators can easily move into, out of, <b>and</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> control <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> can interact with each other without any hindrances during emergency situations; and to keep noise and other distractions to a minimum.|$|R
6000|$|Carl {{was embarrassed}} before Genie's steady, youthful, trusting gaze.
