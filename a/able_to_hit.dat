5|$|American {{forces were}} quick to counter the attack. M20 {{recoilless}} rifles destroyed the machine gun positions, and American mortars began firing on any North Korean positions they could locate. However, North Korean forces {{were quick to}} advance up the Notch, to {{the crest of the}} hill that made up the pass. There, the discovered B Company, 19th Infantry, encamped. The 19th Infantry was apparently not prepared for combat, as North Korean forces were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> the American force and drive it off the hill, killing several of the American soldiers with bayonets. At about 12:00, B Company was driven from the crest of the Notch, and further confusion erupted when US Air Force aircraft accidentally strafed the retreating B Company. Neighboring positions also mistakenly attacked B Company, which retreated with 12 killed.|$|E
5|$|At 06:45, a U.S. scout {{aircraft}} sighted {{the carriers}} of Nagumo's main body. At 06:58, a Japanese scout aircraft reported {{the location of}} Hornets task force. Both sides raced {{to be the first}} to attack the other. The Japanese were first to get their strike force launched, with 64 aircraft, including 21 Aichi D3A2 dive bombers, 20 Nakajima B5N2 torpedo bombers, 21 A6M3 Zero fighters, and two Nakajima B5N2 command and control aircraft on the way towards Hornet by 07:40. Also at 07:40, two U.S. SBD-3 Dauntless scout aircraft, responding to the earlier sighting of the Japanese carriers, arrived and dove on Zuihō. With the Japanese combat air patrol (CAP) busy chasing other U.S. scout aircraft away, the two U.S. aircraft were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> Zuihō with both their 500-pound bombs, causing heavy damage and preventing the carrier's flight deck from being able to land aircraft.|$|E
5|$|At {{this time}} the Luftwaffe was sending {{increased}} numbers of Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters over England, at night and at low-level. They were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> the coastal areas and their speed and agility meant they were a difficult prospect to intercept. The German pilots were disadvantaged in some respects. There {{was a lack of}} nigh-flying experience in these units, the Fw 190s did not carry radar and had a short range. Aside from a small mirror, the pilot could not always see behind him well enough at night. On 16 May 1943 the Fw 190s lost four and probably a fifth to 85 Squadron. On 13 June 1943 Cunningham intercepted an Fw 190 not far from his airfield at West Malling. The GCI controller telephoned the crew-room to notify them the commanding officer was closing on an enemy aircraft heading to London. They heard both aircraft and the brief burst of fire followed by the explosion. To his amazement, Cunningham later learned the pilot—Leutnant Ullrich from 3./Schnellkampfgeschwader 10 (Fast Bomber Wing 10—SKG 10)—was thrown through the canopy as the Fw 190A-5, Werknummer, 840047 code CO+LT, fell earthwards. He deployed his parachute and was picked up by a searchlight crew with a broken arm.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of February 6, Foote's seven Union gunboats arrived at Fort Henry and {{established}} their position around 12:30p.m. They soon opened fire at 1,700 yards, beginning an exchange of gunfire with Fort Henry that continued for over an hour. After Tilghman rejected an initial call to surrender, the fleet continued to bombard the fort. This was its first engagement using newly designed and hastily constructed ironclads. Foote deployed the four ironclad gunboats in a line abreast, followed by the three timberclads, {{under the command of}} Seth Ledyard Phelps, which were held back for long-range, but less effective fire against the fort. The high water level of the river and the low elevation of Fort Henry's guns allowed Foote's fleet to escape serious destruction. The Confederate fire was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> the ironclads only where their armor was strongest. During the bombardment, all four of the Union ironclads were repeatedly hit by Confederate fire. The USS Essex was seriously damaged when a 32-pound shot from Fort Henry penetrated the ironclad, hitting the middle boiler and sending scalding steam through half the ship. Thirty-two crewmen were killed or wounded, including commander William D. Porter. The ship was out of action {{for the remainder of the}} campaign.|$|E

25|$|Baseball {{movies were}} not {{considered}} a viable commercial prospect {{at the time and}} every studio passed except for Orion Pictures, which gave Shelton a USD $7.5 million budget, an eight-week shooting schedule, and creative freedom. Even so, many cast members accepted salaries lower than their usual requirements due to their enthusiasm for the material. Costner was cast because of his natural athletic ability. During filming, Costner was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> two home runs while the cameras were rolling.|$|E
25|$|Aaron {{spent the}} winter of 1953 playing in Puerto Rico. Mickey Owen, the team's manager, helped Aaron with his batting stance. Up to that time, Aaron hit most pitches to left field or center field, but after working with Owen, Aaron was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> the ball more {{effectively}} all over the field. During his stay in Puerto Rico, Owen also helped Aaron to transition from second baseman to outfielder. Aaron had not played well at second base, but Owen had noted that Aaron could catch fly balls and throw the ball well from the outfield to the infield.|$|E

25|$|Departing Kiel on 12 June 1944, U-998 left on her first, and only, war patrol. Five {{days into}} her patrol U-998 was located on 16 June 1944, west of Bergen, by two Norwegian Mosquito FB Mk XVIII {{aircraft}} from 333 Sqdn RAF, piloted by Erling U. Johansen and Lauritz Humlen. They were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> {{the boat with}} 57mm cannon fire and depth charges which caused severe damage to U-998. She was forced to return to Bergen, Norway, where she was removed from active service due to the damage from the attack. U-998 would be cannibalized for spare parts until being broken up later in 1944.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} used to disparage the hit and the batter who made it, since it implies minimal effort on his part. The Giants' Mel Ott was {{frequently}} cited for this, since he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> many such home runs in the Polo Grounds during his career and his physique and unusual batting stance were not those usually associated with a power hitter. The hit most frequently recalled as a Chinese home run was the three-run pinch hit walk-off shot by Dusty Rhodes that won {{the first game of the}} 1954 World Series for the Giants on their way to a sweep of the Cleveland Indians.|$|E
25|$|With 3 {{minutes left}} in the 4th quarter and the game tied at 79, Howard {{converted}} a 3-point play to give the Magic an 82–79 lead. On the next Laker possession, the Magic played good defense, but Trevor Ariza was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> a 3-pointer as the shot clock expired to tie the game at 82. After Hedo Türkoğlu hit a stepback 3-point shot, Howard blocked Gasol's jumper, giving him a single-game NBA Finals record with 9 blocked shots. On the bench to witness it was a previous record holder, his assistant coach Patrick Ewing, who had 8 in Game 5 of the 1994 NBA Finals while with the New York Knicks. Türkoğlu made another jumper with 1:34 remaining to give the Magic a 5-point lead.|$|E

25|$|The Irish {{began the}} game with the ball, and marched down the field with a 76-yard drive that culminated in a 5-yard Brady Quinn {{touchdown}} pass to Rhema McKnight. Late in the quarter, key Wolverine running back Mike Hart was injured during a run, keeping him out {{for the rest of}} the game. In the second quarter, on Michigan's first drive past the 50-yard line, Garrett Rivas was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> a 38-yard field goal to make the score 7-3 in favor of the Irish. Later in the quarter, the Irish lost McKnight to what would later be revealed as a season-ending knee injury. Quinn and Walker, however, led the Irish on another long drive, culminating in a 5-yard touchdown pass to Jeff Samardzija to give the Irish a 14-3 lead at halftime.|$|E
25|$|Criticisms {{extended}} to the supplies for the troops: British soldiers were sent out from England with boots made substantially from cardboard, which rapidly disintegrated {{and had to be}} bound with cloth or string to hold together. While the Indian Army was equipped with highly effective Dum-dum bullets produced in India, British bullets sent to Egypt were simply pointed, and 1,000,000 rounds had to have their ends filed off to increase their effectiveness. The rough remodelling meant the bullets were inaccurate at long ranges, giving soldiers a choice of bullets <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> their target but only wound, or killing bullets which were likely to miss and could jam the guns. Railway engines needed to carry troops and supplies into Sudan had to be obtained {{from all over the world}} as British companies were unable to supply at short notice. By contrast, American companies could supply locomotives immediately which were more effective and cheaper than some obtained from England.|$|E
25|$|He was {{a leading}} base stealer {{in the first half}} of his career. He was also <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> triples, {{reaching}} double figures four times. As he became slower in later years while his body grew and his injuries mounted, Gwynn would anticipate pitchers' moves and would sometimes steal bases by breaking for second base before the pitcher started delivering the ball to the hitter. Defensively, he improved considerably and was among the best right fielders at quickly going to the line, cutting the ball off, and throwing to second base. He worked on his defense, constantly checking right field walls in ballparks to study how balls bounced off them. His running ability also helped him on defense. When he entered the majors, Gwynn was not a very good right fielder nor an accurate thrower. For a long time, he worked on his defense harder than he did his hitting. While he was a natural hitter, he was most proud of his five Gold Gloves, calling his first one from 1986 his most treasured piece of memorabilia. He became a perennial leader in outfield assists. Although his arm was not particularly strong, he learned to use his body to build momentum into his throws. In college, he could not even throw the ball from center field to second base without it hopping first.|$|E
