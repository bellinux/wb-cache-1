The volcano is {{responsible}} for a large Holocene eruption with <b>a</b> <b>Volcano</b> explosivity index 7, {{the largest in the}} Andean Central Volcanic Zone for 5000 years.

5|$|Greenland ice cores show {{evidence}} of a large volcanic eruption in 1642±5BCE, which was suggested as being associated with Santorini. However, volcanic ash retrieved from an ice core does not match the expected Santorini fingerprint. The late Holocene eruption of the Mount Aniakchak, <b>a</b> <b>volcano</b> in Alaska, is now {{believed to be the}} source of the minute shards of volcanic glass in the Greenland ice core.|$|E
5|$|Incapillo is a Pleistocene caldera, a {{depression}} {{formed by the}} collapse of <b>a</b> <b>volcano,</b> in the La Rioja province of Argentina. Part of the Argentine Andes, it is considered the southernmost volcanic centre in the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes with Pleistocene activity. Incapillo is one of several ignimbritic or calderic systems that, along with 44 active stratovolcanoes, are part of the Central Volcanic Zone.|$|E

5|$|Lastarria is <b>a</b> <b>volcano</b> {{that lies}} {{on the border between}} Chile and Argentina.

5|$|Monte Burney is <b>a</b> <b>volcano</b> in {{southern}} Chile, {{part of its}} Austral Volcanic Zone which consists of six volcanoes with activity during the Quaternary.

40|$|Until recently, {{people living}} in <b>a</b> <b>volcano's</b> shadow had little help in {{predicting}} eruptions. In the past 300 years, volcanic eruptions, most of them unexpected, have killed more than 250, 000 people. In 2000, experts estimated that 500 million people were living in areas at risk from catastrophic volcanic eruptions. This illustrated essay describes the strides scientists have made in eruption forecasting in recent years, especially tools for detecting changes in <b>a</b> <b>volcano's</b> seismicity, ground deformation, and gases, and explores why accurately predicting volcanic events remains difficult. A background essay and discussion questions are included. Educational levels: High school...|$|R

50|$|<b>A</b> complex <b>volcano,</b> {{also called}} <b>a</b> {{compound}} <b>volcano,</b> is mixed landform consisting of related volcanic centers and their associated lava flows and pyroclastic rock.

5|$|In the late-1960s, Mikhail Ivanovich Budyko {{worked with}} simple {{two-dimensional}} energy-balance climate models {{to investigate the}} reflectivity of ice. He found that the ice-albedo feedback created a positive feedback loop in the Earth's climate system. The more snow and ice, the more solar radiation is reflected back into space and hence the colder Earth grows and the more it snows. Other studies found that pollution or <b>a</b> <b>volcano</b> eruption could provoke the onset of an ice age.|$|E
