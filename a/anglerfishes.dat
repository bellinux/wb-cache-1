25|$|It {{is unknown}} whether male Thaumatichthys are parasitic. The {{structure}} of the jaws in mature males suggests that feeding is impaired after metamorphosis. The larvae are epipelagic like those of other deep-sea <b>anglerfishes,</b> and are found at depths {{of no more than}} 100 m. As the larvae grow and approach metamorphosis, they descend deeper until they reach the bottom. The larvae can be identified by their divided operculum and a subdermal pigment layer that covers the entire head and body.|$|E
25|$|Anglerfish {{are named}} for their {{characteristic}} method of predation. Anglerfish typically {{have at least}} one long filament (the illicium) sprouting {{from the middle of the}} head, protruding above the fish's eyes and terminating in an irregular growth of flesh (the esca) at the tip of the filament. The filament can move in all directions and the esca can be wiggled so as to resemble a prey animal, thus acting as bait to lure other predators close enough for the anglerfish to devour them. Some deep-sea <b>anglerfishes</b> of the bathypelagic zone emit light from their escas to attract prey. This bioluminescence is a result of symbiosis with bacteria.|$|E
25|$|The jaw {{and stomach}} of the <b>anglerfish</b> can extend {{to allow it}} to consume prey up to twice its size. Because of the small amount of food {{available}} in the <b>anglerfish's</b> environment this adaptation allows the <b>anglerfish</b> to store food when there is an abundance.|$|R
2500|$|The name [...] "anglerfish" [...] {{derives from}} the species' {{characteristic}} method of predation. <b>Anglerfish</b> typically {{have at least one}} long filament sprouting from the middle of their heads, termed the illicium. The illicium is the detached and modified first three spines of the anterior dorsal fin. In most <b>anglerfish</b> species, the longest filament is the first. This first spine protrudes above the fish's eyes and terminates in an irregular growth of flesh (the esca), and can move in all directions. <b>Anglerfish</b> can wiggle the esca to make it resemble a prey animal, which lures the <b>anglerfish's</b> prey close enough for the <b>anglerfish</b> to devour them whole.|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} <b>anglerfish</b> for human {{consumption}} has increased {{in the last couple}} of decades because of the delicate consistency of its meat. Accordingly, the fishing pressure has increased considerably in all Nordic fishing regions. Relatively little has, however, hitherto been known about <b>anglerfish</b> biology and ecology. Assessment and management of Nordic <b>anglerfish</b> stocks is difficult to conduct due to the paucity of fisheries and biological data. Answers to questions regarding the spawning behaviour, migratory behaviour and juvenile drift, as well as more knowledge about growth, sexual maturation, diet and natural mortality, would thus form crucial contributions to present and future management of Nordic <b>anglerfish</b> stocks. This report presents a review of the status of current knowledge and research on the biology, ecology, fisheries and stock management of <b>anglerfish</b> in Nordic and European countries, including results and publications from a three-year Nordic cooperative <b>anglerfish</b> research project (2002 - 2004). Preliminary attempts were made at estimating current levels of fishing mortality in the Nordic regions, and the yield and spawning stock per <b>anglerfish</b> recruit. Recommendations on future research are also given...|$|R
25|$|As {{with most}} other deep-sea <b>anglerfishes,</b> Thaumatichthys shows extreme sexual {{dimorphism}} with the females much larger and different in morphology from the males. Female Thaumatichthys {{are characterized by}} a long, broad, flattened head with enlarged premaxillaries on the upper jaw that overhang the relatively short lower jaw. The premaxillaries are hinged with the skull {{in such a way}} that they can be moved down to enclose the lower jaw in a manner similar that of a Venus flytrap. The outer margin of the premaxillaries bear six rows of long, conical, recurved teeth; the teeth in the lower jaw are much shorter. The number and length of the teeth increases as the fish grows.|$|E

40|$|<b>Anglerfish</b> Lophius piscatorius has {{during the}} last two decades become a highly {{exploited}} resource and {{is now one of the}} five most economically important demersal fish species in the Faroese fishery. Despite this, there is at present little information available on the population status of <b>anglerfish</b> in Faroese waters. The main aim of this study is to increase the biological knowledge of <b>anglerfish</b> and to perform an assessment of the stock in order to evaluate the sustainability of the <b>anglerfish</b> fishery and to investigate trophic interactions between <b>anglerfish</b> and other commercially important demersal fish species. <b>Anglerfish</b> illicia, the first fin ray, were used for age reading. The age determinations were validated and concluded to be useful in an age-based assessment because the growth rates were consistent with length frequency and mark-recapture analyses. <b>Anglerfish</b> have a very high growth rate during their first year of life, compared with the older ages. Males mature at a lower length and younger age than females. The L 50 for males and females was 58 cm and 84 cm, respectively, corresponding to an age of around four years for males and seven years for females. Observations of spawning males and females, egg-ribbons and pelagic <b>anglerfish</b> larvae revealed that <b>anglerfish</b> have a prolonged spawning season, which peaks from February to April. In addition, observations showed that there are at least two local spawning areas, one southwest of the Faroe Plateau and one in the Faroe Bank area. Large <b>anglerfish</b> tagged with data storage tags and conventional tags showed a seasonal offshore-onshore migration. They migrated to shallow depths in summer to feed and to deeper waters in winter, presumably to spawn. <b>Anglerfish</b> performed vertical movements up into the water column, and were most active in these vertical movements during the winter time and during the nights, and light intensity seemed to trigger the migrations. <b>Anglerfish</b> distribution was temperature dependent, since <b>anglerfish</b> generally preferred temperatures warmer than 4 ºC, usually between 6. 5 – 11 ºC. This may explain why <b>anglerfish</b> were distributed deeper west of the Faroe Bank area compared to the Faroe Plateau, which is surrounded by cold water deeper than approximately 500 m. <b>Anglerfish</b> in Faroese waters preyed on a variety of food items. They were generally eating fish and the most important prey species in terms of numbers were Norway pout and blue whiting, whereas cod and haddock contributed most in weight. Annual consumption by <b>anglerfish</b> on commercially important demersal species, such as cod, haddock and saithe, was estimated to correspond to 33, 19 and 2 % of the landings and to 75, 20 and 2 % of biomass losses due to natural mortality, respectively. Even with this high cod consumption by <b>anglerfish,</b> cod cannibalism and fishing mortality still have greater impact on the cod stock dynamics than predation by <b>anglerfish.</b> The annual biomass loss of <b>anglerfish</b> due to cannibalism was estimated to nearly 15 % of the annual loss due to natural mortality. <b>Anglerfish</b> in Faroese waters may be regarded as a separate stock because all life stages are found in the area, local spawning area, seasonal offshore-onshore migration on the Faroe Plateau, together with insignificant emigration/immigration (< 5 %). An age-based stock assessment of <b>anglerfish</b> in Faroese waters for the period 1999 – 2011 showed that the stock biomass ranged between 9000 and 19000 t with a peak in 2004 – 2005 and the fishing mortality for age 3 – 8 varied between 0. 2 and 0. 5 year- 1. The yield per recruit curve indicated that the stock was slightly growth overfished. Decreasing the fishing mortality could potentially increase the yield per recruit by around 10 % leading to a 50 % higher equilibrium biomass of <b>anglerfish.</b> No clear stock-recruitment relationship was found. On the other hand, <b>anglerfish</b> year-class strength was correlated with environmental variables, such as sandeel abundance. Hence, the rather short time series of <b>anglerfish</b> year-class strength provides little or no evidence of recruitment overfishing. It is recommended that stock assessments should be performed on an annual basis, allowing managers to react timely when there are signs of overfishing or recruitment failure due to natural or fishery causes...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Anglerfishes</b> are fish of the teleost order Lophiiformes [...] They are bony fish {{named for}} their {{characteristic}} mode of predation, {{in which a}} fleshy growth from the fish's head (the esca or illicium) acts as a lure.|$|E

40|$|Discards {{estimates}} from Spanish bottom otter trawl of <b>anglerfish,</b> Lophius budegassa (black <b>anglerfish)</b> and L. piscatorius (white <b>anglerfish),</b> in Northeast Atlantic Ocean (ICES Sub-areas VI, VII and Divisions VIIIabd) {{are presented in}} this paper. Information was obtained by observers on board in different discard programs carried out by Spanish Research Institutes. Total discards obtained by the different raising procedures were very similar and total discard raised by effort (number of trips) as a simple estimator was assumed as the adequate value. Values in weight range from 4 t to 590 t, and from 4 t to 320 t for white and black <b>anglerfish</b> respectively in Sub-areas VI and VII. Length distributions of discarded <b>anglerfish</b> (Sub-areas VI and VII) show {{that most of the}} specimens are juvenile individuals. Discards estimations show a high variability in weight and number along the period studied. Yearly abundance of juveniles in the area is a factor to understand the variability of discard quantities. This trend in Sub-areas VI and VII is reflected by similar pattern between juveniles (length < 31 cm) discards estimations and recruitment indices (age 0) obtained by French (FR-EVHOES) for black <b>anglerfish,</b> and Irish (IR-IGFS) for white <b>anglerfish.</b> Inter-annual variation may also be explained by legal restriction on minimum weights (DCR) laid down in 2000 due to change in onboard sorting procedures...|$|R
40|$|<b>Anglerfish</b> are {{valuable}} commercial species for the Spanish otter-trawl fisheries operating in ICES Sub areas VI-VII and Divisions VIIIabd. Nevertheless, discard data {{of these species}} have never been used in stock assessment. Most of the specimens discarded are juveniles, and the motive argued by skippers, interviewed on board about the reasons for discarding <b>anglerfish,</b> are the small fish size and little market value (Project 98 / 095). The Council Regulation (2406 / 96) laying down common marketing standards for certain fishery products, set a minimum landing weight of 500 g for <b>anglerfish.</b> As this regulation was implemented in 2000, an increased <b>anglerfish</b> discard in trawl fleet should be expected since that year. Total estimates and causes of <b>anglerfish</b> discard are presented in this poster. Discard data were obtained by observers on board in different discard programs carried out by two Spanish Research Institutes, and are available for the periods 1988 - 1989, 1994, 1999 - 2000 and 2003 - 2006 (Table 1).

2500|$|Thaumatichthys is a genus of deep-sea {{anglerfish}} in {{the family}} Thaumatichthyidae, with three known species. Its scientific name means [...] "wonder-fish" [...] in Greek; oceanographer Anton Bruun described these fishes as [...] "altogether one of the oddest creatures in the teeming variety of the fish world." [...] In contrast to other <b>anglerfishes,</b> the bioluminescent lure (called the [...] "esca") of Thaumatichthys is located inside its cavernous mouth. They are worldwide in distribution and are ambush predators living near the ocean floor.|$|E
2500|$|The {{males in}} some deep sea <b>anglerfishes</b> are {{much smaller than}} the females. When they find a female they bite into her skin, {{releasing}} an enzyme that digests the skin of their mouth and her body and fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level. The male then slowly atrophies, losing first his digestive organs, then his brain, heart, and eyes, ending as nothing more than a pair of gonads, which release sperm in response to hormones in the female's bloodstream indicating egg release. This extreme sexual dimorphism ensures that, when the female is ready to spawn, she has a mate immediately available. A single anglerfish female can [...] "mate" [...] with many males in this manner.|$|E
50|$|They {{are easily}} {{distinguished}} from other <b>anglerfishes</b> by their {{possession of a}} second light-bearing dorsal fin spine immediately behind the illicium (the bioluminescent lure present in other <b>anglerfishes).</b>|$|E
2500|$|Because <b>anglerfish</b> are {{opportunistic}} foragers, {{they show}} {{a range of}} preferred prey with fish at the extremes of the size spectrum, whilst showing increased selectivity for certain prey. One study examining the stomach contents of threadfin <b>anglerfish</b> off the Pacific coast of Central America found [...] these fish primarily ate two categories of benthic prey: crustaceans and teleost fish. The most frequent prey were pandalid shrimp. Interestingly, 52% of the stomachs examined were empty, supporting the observations that <b>anglerfish</b> are low energy consumers.|$|R
40|$|Within {{the frame}} of an {{international}} tagging program which {{has been carried out}} since 1995, movements of black and white <b>anglerfish</b> (Lophius budegassa and L. piscatorius) in Southern European waters were studied. This is the first large-scale study on movements of tagged black <b>anglerfish.</b> A total of 877 black <b>anglerfish</b> (6 - 88 cm total length) and 1326 white <b>anglerfish</b> (15 - 137 cm total length) were tagged. Times at liberty ranged from 1 to 665 days, with recapture rates of 21 (2. 4 %) and 50 (3. 8 %), respectively. A description of our tagging procedures is presented, together with the influences of the gear used, fish length and area of tagging on recapture rates. The type of fishing gear was the main factor affecting recapture rates. Fish length was neither related to the displacement distance nor to the time at liberty while the displacement distance was related to the time at liberty. Recapture locations suggested that movements occurred both in- and offshore. The largest displacement recorded was 408 km of a black <b>anglerfish</b> from southern to northern Bay of Biscay. The movements of the <b>anglerfish</b> indicate a mixing between northern and southern populations which may have strong implications for the current geographical boundaries of the stocks from a management perspective.

The angling apparatus is located {{at the tip of the}} snout just above the mouth and is used to attract prey. Lophiid <b>anglerfishes</b> also have two or three other dorsal fin spines located more posteriorly on the head, and a separate spinous dorsal fin with one to three spines located more posteriorly on the body just in front of the soft dorsal fin. In the more primitive anglerfish genera (Sladenia and Lophiodes), the gill opening extends partially in front of the elongated pectoral fin base.

These include; the colour of the {{peritoneum}} (black for L. budegassa and white for L. piscatorius) and the number of rays in the second dorsal fin (L. budegassa, 9-10 and L. piscatorius, 11-12). Also, minor differences in their distribution occur. Black <b>anglerfish</b> tend to have a more southern distribution (Mediterranean and eastern North Atlantic from the British Isles to Senegal) whereas the white <b>anglerfish</b> are distributed further north, (Mediterranean, Black Sea and eastern North Atlantic from Barents Sea to the Straits of Gibraltar). Despite these differences, the overall distribution of the black and white <b>anglerfish</b> tend to overlap greatly.
