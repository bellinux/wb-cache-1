25|$|Among all gay and {{bisexual}} men with HIV infection classified as AIDS in the United States in 2015, African Americans {{accounted for the}} highest number (3,928; 39%), followed by whites (3,096; 31%) and Hispanics/Latinos (2,430; 24%). At the end of 2014, 508,676 gay {{and bisexual}} men were living with diagnosed HIV infection (53% of everyone living with diagnosed HIV in the US). Of gay and bisexual men living with diagnosed HIV, 157,758 (31%) were African American, 212,558 (42%) were white, and 109,857 (22%) were Hispanic/Latino. From 2005 to 2014 diagnoses <b>among</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> gay and bisexual men increased 22% but has increased less than 1% between 2010 and 2014. HIV diagnoses <b>among</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> gay and bisexual men aged 13 to 24 increased 87% between 2005 and 2014, but with diagnoses declining 2% between 2010 and 2014.|$|E
25|$|Delany {{worked for}} a brief period as {{principal}} of a colored school before going into practice as a physician. During another cholera outbreak in 1854, most doctors abandoned the city, as did many residents who could leave, as no one knew how the disease was caused nor how to control the epidemic. With a small group of nurses, Delany remained and cared for the victims. Delany is rarely acknowledged in the historiography of African American education (Anderson, 1988; Bullock, 1967; Butchart, 1980). He is not counted <b>among</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> educators, perhaps because he neither featured prominently in the establishment of schools nor philosophized at length on Black education.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{esophageal cancer}} is the seventh-leading {{cause of cancer death}} among males (making up 4% of the total). The National Cancer Institute {{estimated}} there were about 18,000 new cases and more than 15,000 deaths from esophageal cancer in 2013 (the American Cancer Society estimated that during 2014, about 18,170 new esophageal cancer cases would be diagnosed, resulting in 15,450 deaths). The squamous-cell carcinoma type is more common <b>among</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> males with a history of heavy smoking or alcohol use. Until the 1970s, squamous-cell carcinoma accounted {{for the vast majority of}} esophageal cancers in the United States. In recent decades, incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus (which is associated with Barrett's esophagus) steadily rose in the United States to the point that it has now surpassed squamous-cell carcinoma. In contrast to squamous-cell carcinoma, esophageal adenocarcinoma is more common in Caucasian men (over the age of 60) than it is in African Americans. Multiple reports indicate esophageal adenocarcinoma incidence has increased during the past 20 years, especially in non-Hispanic white men. Esophageal adenocarcinoma age-adjusted incidence increased in New Mexico from 1973 to 1997. This increase was found in non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics and became predominant in non-Hispanic whites. Esophageal cancer incidence and mortality rates for African Americans continue to be higher than the rate for Causasians. However, incidence and mortality of esophageal cancer has significantly decreased among African Americans since the early 1980s, whereas with Caucasians it has continued to increase. Between 1975 and 2004, incidence of the adenocarcinoma type increased among white American males by over 460% and among white American females by 335%.|$|E

500|$|No {{location}} {{saw more}} visitors for its possibilities of homosexual nightlife than Harlem, the predominantly African American section of New York City. White [...] "slummers" [...] enjoyed jazz, nightclubs, {{and anything else}} they wished. Blues singers Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith, Ethel Waters, and Gladys Bentley sang about affairs with women to visitors such as Tallulah Bankhead, Beatrice Lillie, and the soon-to-be-named Joan Crawford. Homosexuals began to draw comparisons between their newly recognized minority status and that of African Americans. <b>Among</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> residents of Harlem, lesbian relationships were common and tolerated, though not overtly embraced. Some women staged lavish wedding ceremonies, even filing licenses using masculine names with New York City.

40|$|The risk of {{prostate}} cancer diagnosis <b>among</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> is 66 % greater than among European <b>American</b> men. For <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> with {{a family history of}} hereditary prostate cancer the increased risk of diagnosis is even greater. Thus, this population should be a prime target for chemoprevention strategies. In addition to the higher incidence {{of prostate}} cancer <b>among</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> compared with other populations, the mortality {{of prostate cancer}} among this high-risk population is significantly greater than 100 % compared with other populations, thus further demonstrating the need for chemoprevention in this target population. Autopsy studies and clinical findings support the argument that prostate cancer exhibits more aggressive biological behavior and perhaps more rapid growth <b>among</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> compared with European Americans. It is hypothesized that genetic and epigenetic factors may be responsible for a more rapid growth rate <b>among</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> compared with other populations. Accumulating evidence indicates that a diet high in fat content is closely associated with prostate cancer progression. Investigators have reported that fat intake and percentage of energy from fat were highest in <b>African</b> <b>Americans,</b> followed by European Americans, Japanese Americans, and Chinese <b>Americans.</b> In conclusion, <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> are an important target population to include in chemoprevention trials that include dietary factors as preventive agents...|$|R

In one carefully controlled study, researchers compared rates of victimization among LGBT youth and their heterosexual siblings, and they found significantly higher rates of abuse among the LGB individuals. Comparing rates of perceived discrimination <b>among</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> and White individuals, researchers have found large differences in reports of discrimination: 30.9% of Whites reported experiencing [...] "major discrimination" [...] throughout their lives compared to 48.9% of African Americans. [...] Similarly, 3.4% of Whites reported experiencing discrimination [...] "often" [...] in their lives, compared to 24.8% of African Americans.
