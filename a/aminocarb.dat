50|$|<b>Aminocarb</b> {{has been}} {{extensively}} used in eastern Canada since 1976 {{in order to control}} the spruce budworm. The fate of this chemical in the ecosystem and detection of <b>aminocarb</b> was studied by the use of two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography. The use of thin-layer chromatography helped isolate and identify the methyl amino, amino and hydroxymethyl analogues from the in vitro metabolism of <b>aminocarb</b> by liver homogenates from humans and rats.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aminocarb</b> can be {{degraded}} through irradiation and hydrolysis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aminocarb</b> can {{be broken}} down by short-wave {{ultraviolet}} radiation. Irradiation is often carried out by a high pressure xenon-mercury lamp. Irradiating <b>aminocarb</b> in ethyl alcohol and cyclohexene solutions initially causes the oxidation of the dimethylamine moiety. The process eventually leads to the formation of a 4-dimethylamino-3-methyl phenol product.|$|E
50|$|In an {{experiment}} where young brown bullhead {{were exposed to}} <b>aminocarb</b> at lethal and sublethal concentrations, their tissue distribution was examined and showed that the concentration of residues in each tissue increased with the concentration of exposure of <b>aminocarb.</b> The liver and stomach/intestine had the highest amount of accumulation of residues.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aminocarb</b> is {{also known}} as a cholinesterase {{inhibitor}} that has nervous system effects causing convulsions and respiratory failure. It can also be absorbed through the skin, causing long-term effects to the nervous system and liver.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aminocarb</b> is an {{carbamate}} insecticide {{widely used}} to protect cotton fields, crop fields, and forests from insect infestation. It helps in the control of aphids, soil mollusks, lepidopterous larvae, {{and other types of}} chewing insects. It is most commonly administered as an aerosol spray.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aminocarb</b> {{undergoes}} hydrolysis to 4-dimethylamino-3-methylphenol in 25 °C {{purified water}} when pH {{of the water}} is 6.4. 4-dimethylamino-3-methylphenol is then either directly or via 2-methyl-1,4-dihydorquinone converted to 2-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone. If methylamine or diethylamine {{are present in the}} solution 2-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone will readily react. Monoepoxides and diepoxides of 2-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone are formed.|$|E

40|$|<b>Aminocarb</b> is {{a widely}} applied {{carbamate}} insecticide with action of controlling pests such as Lepidoptera and Coleoptera. In this study, subchronic effects on Wistar rats were investigated using hematological, biochemical, and histological techniques. Rats were exposed orally at sublethal levels of 10, 20, or 40 mg/kg body weight (groups A, B, and C, respectively) for 14 d. Hematological results revealed no statistical differences after 1 d of exposure but significant reduction in white blood cells detected after 7 d of exposure in group C, as well as, in all treated groups after 14 d of exposure. Biochemical data showed a decrease of acetylcholinesterase activity in all groups after 1 d of exposure with a return to normal after 7 and 14 d. Significant increase in alkaline phosphatase activity of rats exposed to <b>aminocarb</b> was noted after 7 d of treatment. The levels of triglycerides were also significantly decreased. The present investigation also showed {{a significant increase in}} content of serum urea and creatinine in animals from group A (14 d), and from groups B and C (7 and 14 d). Histological results demonstrated hemorrhagic focus on hepatic and renal parenchyma in all exposed groups.

40|$|Historical aerial {{applications}} of the insecticide Matacil 1. 8 D {{provide an opportunity to}} look for potential effects of the endocrine disrupting compound 4 -nonyiphel (4 -NP) on Atlantic salmon (Sdlmo slar) populations. Matacil 1. 8 D contained the carbamate insecticide <b>aminocarb,</b> with 4 -NP as primary solvent Between 1975 and 1985 Matacil 1. 8 D was applied to forests in Atlantic Canada to control damage from the spruce budworm (Cboristonerafumiferana). After spraying, estimated concentrations of 4 -NP in water fell within a range in which estrogenic effects might be anticipated. The spraying coincided with final stages of smolt development in salmon. Salmon catch data were evaluated considering effects on survival of the smolt stage. There wa siificant negative. r ionship between the returns of salmo and the proportion of tributaries sprayed within. the Restigoudhe River drainage basin in 1977. There was also a broader event of unusually heavy salmon smolt mortality in 1977, which contains a significant relationship indicating that where Matacil 1. 8 D spraying occurred, the smolt mortality increased. For 16 rivers exposed to spraying between 1973 and 1990, a significant proportion (0. 005) of the lowest salmon catches coincided with Matacil 1. 8 D spraying. A decline coinciding with the use of Matacil 1. 8 D 1 was also apparent in: blueback herring (Alsa aestiva) catche...|$|E
40|$|The {{combination}} of insecticides with entomogenous nematodes in {{integrated pest management}} protocols could be an effective way of lowering environmental loads of harmful insecticides. The compatibility of two locally isolated steinernematid nematodes, (Steinernema sp. Newfoundland strain no. 1 (L 1 C) and Steinernema sp. Newfoundland strain no. 2 (5 B)) with the organochlorine insecticides chlordane and methoxychlor, the organophosphates diazinon and malathion, the carbamates carbaryl (SevinR) and <b>aminocarb</b> (MatacilR), {{as well as the}} insect growth regulator diflubenzuron (DimilinR), was investigated. [...] Direct exposure of infective juveniles to chlordane, methoxychlor, diazinon and carbaryl at a concentration of 1. 0 mg/ml proved toxic. Exposure of nematodes to ≤ 0. 1 mg/ml of these three and ≤ 1. 0 mg/ml of malathion, carbaryl, Matacil and Dimilin did not cause significant mortality to the juvenile of both nematode. [...] Efficacy of infective juveniles to the Greater Wax moth, Galleria mellonella was unaffected, except where nematodes were lethally affected by chlordane, methoxychlor a-and diazinon at 1. 0 mg/ml. [...] In vitro development of both nematodes was impaired by exposure to all tested insecticides. Toxicity appeared to be related to both direct toxicity toward adult and non-ensheathed nematode larvae as well as towards the associated bacterial symbionts. [...] The doubling or generation time of the bacterial symbionts Xenorhabdus sp. L 1 C and Xenorhabdus sp. 5 B, was found to be approximately 90 and 117 minutes respectively. Bacteria showed variable sensitivity to the tested insecticides but the carbamates and diazinon were particularly toxic at ≥ 0. 1 mg/ml. [...] The juveniles of both nematode strains demonstrated active seeking of hosts by migrating in soil towards G. mellonella larvae. [...] Nematode migration in soil was not impaired by the organochlorine insecticide, chlordane. However the organophosphate diazinon reduced migration of both nematodes at ≥ 0. 1 mg/ml. [...] The data obtained suggest that compatibility of nematodes with insecticides in integrated pest management programs can be attained by lowering insecticide levels or altering timing of insecticide and nematode application...|$|E
40|$|Several {{automated}} reversed-phase HPLC {{methods have}} been developed to determine trace concentrations of carbamate pesticides (which are of concern in Ontario environmental samples) in water by utilizing two solid sorbent extraction techniques. One of the methods is known as on-line pre-concentration'. This technique involves passing 100 milliliters of sample water through a 3 cm pre-column, packed with 5 micron ODS sorbent, at flow rates varying from 5 - 10 mUmin. By the use of a valve apparatus, the HPLC system is then switched to a gradient mobile phase program consisting of acetonitrile and water. The analytes, Propoxur, Carbofuran, Carbaryl, Propham, Captan, Chloropropham, Barban, and Butylate, which are pre-concentrated on the pre-column, are eluted and separated on a 25 cm C- 8 analytical column and determined by UV absorption at 220 nm. The total analytical time is 60 minutes, and the pre-column can be used repeatedly for the analysis of as many as thirty samples. The method is highly sensitive as 100 percent of the analytes present in the sample can be injected into the HPLC. No breakthrough of any of the analytes was observed and the minimum detectable concentrations range from 10 to 480 ng/L. The developed method is totally automated for the analysis of one sample. When the above mobile phase is modified with a buffer solution, <b>Aminocarb,</b> Benomyl, and its degradation product, MBC, can also be detected along with the above pesticides with baseline resolution for all of the analytes. The method can also be easily modified to determine Benomyl and MBC both as solute and as particulate matter. By using a commercially available solid phase extraction cartridge, in lieu of a pre-column, for the extraction and concentration of analytes, a completely automated method has been developed with the aid of the Waters Millilab Workstation. Sample water is loaded at 10 mL/min through a cartridge and the concentrated analytes are eluted from the sorbent with acetonitrile. The resulting eluate is blown-down under nitrogen, made up to volume with water, and injected into the HPLC. The total analytical time is 90 minutes. Fifty percent of the analytes present in the sample can be injected into the HPLC, and recoveries for the above eight pesticides ranged from 84 to 93 percent. The minimum detectable concentrations range from 20 to 960 ng/L. The developed method is totally automated for the analysis of up to thirty consecutive samples. The method has proven to be applicable to both purer water samples as well as untreated lake water samples...|$|E
