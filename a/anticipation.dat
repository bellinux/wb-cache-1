The explicit investigation of <b>anticipations</b> in relation to adaptive behavior is a recent approach. In this introduction to the workshop, we first provide psychological background that motivates and inspires the study of <b>anticipations</b> in the adaptive behavior field. Next, we endow the workshop with a basic framework for the study of <b>anticipations</b> in adaptive behavior. Different anticipatory mechanisms are identified and categorized. First fundamental distinctions are drawn between implicitly anticipatory mechanisms, payoff <b>anticipations,</b> sensorial <b>anticipations,</b> and state <b>anticipations.</b> A case study allows further insights into the drawn distinctions.

40|$|International audienceThis {{contribution}} aims to {{show how}} exploration and exploitation might be tightly intertwined when modeling sensorimotor behaviors with coordinated predictive local representations. In such a framework, learning equals to creating and selecting <b>anticipations</b> {{to adapt to the}} dynamics of the agent and its environment. Motor actions are undertaken based on the expected outcome of the <b>anticipations,</b> and <b>anticipations</b> reinforced when successfully matching the dynamics. Reaching goals is thus equivalent to navigating through the sensorimotor space by forming and following chains of coordinated predictions. Although the agent may constantly only try to exploit its knowledge, the presence of multiple dynamic goals, the lack of correct <b>anticipations,</b> interactional noise or external constraint will lead to further exploration and the generation of new task-independent representations...|$|R

40|$|In most {{collections}} of segmental speech errors, exchanges are less frequent than <b>anticipations</b> and perseverations. However, {{it has been}} suggested that in inner speech exchanges might be more frequent than either <b>anticipations</b> or perseverations, because many half-way repaired errors (Yew…uhh [...] New York) are classified as repaired <b>anticipations,</b> but may equally well be half-way repaired exchanges. In this paper it is demonstrated for experimentally elicited speech errors that indeed in inner speech exchanges are more frequent than <b>anticipations</b> and perseverations. The predominance of exchanges can be explained by assuming a mechanism of planning and serial ordering segments during the generation of speech that is qualitatively similar to the scan-copier model proposed by Shattuck-Hufnagel (Sublexical units and suprasegmental structure in speech production planning.

40|$|We {{consider}} a pure exchange financial economy, where agents observe private information signals, form private <b>anticipations</b> and face an "exogenous uncertainty" {{on the future}} state, and an "endogenous uncertainty", on the future prices. At a sequential equilibrium, all agents expect the "true" price as a possible outcome, and elect optimal strategies, which clear on all markets at every time period. This concept differs from both traditional ones of temporary equilibrium and sequential equilibrium with perfect price foresight. We display on an example a continuum of sequential equilibria, varying with agents' <b>anticipations.</b> We show, when <b>anticipations</b> are private or prone to change, that "correct" price forecasts need always embed a set of "minimum uncertainty", which only depends on the fundamentals {{of the economy and}} current period prices. When <b>anticipations</b> are so correct, we prove the existence of a sequential equilibrium is still characterized by the no-arbitrage condition.
