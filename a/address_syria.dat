5000|$|The Arab League held {{a special}} meeting on Syria {{following}} the attack, and on June 2, {{called on the}} U.N. Security Council [...] "to take the necessary measures to protect Syrian civilians, including {{increasing the number of}} international monitors". The following day, Assad <b>addressed</b> <b>Syria</b> in a 70-minute televised address in which he denounced the Houla attacks as [...] "massacres which even monsters would not have carried out". He stated that the attackers had been funded by [...] "outside forces" [...] and promised a [...] "real war" [...] against them.|$|R
5000|$|In 2000, Dalila {{was active}} in the [...] "Damascus Spring", the title used for the period of {{political}} activism that followed following the death of former president Assad in June 2000 and the succession to the presidency of his son, Bashar Assad. During a general crackdown on the Damascus Spring activists, Dalila was arrested in Damascus on 9 September 2001, reportedly following a lecture advocating greater democracy and transparency in government and an end to corruption. The lecture was titled [...] "The Syrian Economy: problems and solutions" [...] and also <b>addressed</b> <b>Syria's</b> worsening economy and called for the abolition of state monopolies.|$|R
5000|$|In 2013 John Kerry remarked [...] "The {{relationship}} between the US and UK has often been described as special or essential {{and it has been}} described thus simply because it is. It was before a vote the other day in Parliament and it will be for long after that vote." [...] This comment was brought about after the parliament vote to not conduct military strikes against Syria. William Hague replied [...] "So the United Kingdom will continue to work closely with the United States, taking a highly active role in <b>addressing</b> the <b>Syria</b> crisis and working with our closest ally over the coming weeks and months." ...|$|R

2500|$|In his January 10, 2007 {{address to}} the nation, President Bush {{asserted}} that succeeding in Iraq begins with <b>addressing</b> Iran and <b>Syria.</b> [...] "Iran is providing material support for attacks on American troops. We will disrupt the attacks on our forces. We'll interrupt the flow of support from Iran and Syria. And we will seek out and destroy the networks providing advanced weaponry and training to our enemies in Iraq," [...] Bush said.|$|R
40|$|Neither {{transitional}} justice nor post-conflict development is possible without the other. Thinking about reconstruction, and development more generally, {{requires an understanding}} of core political issues of ownership, governance and participation which are similarly key concerns of {{transitional justice}}. Such issues {{also need to be}} informed by longer-term processes for development which includes strategies for rehabilitation, reform and reparation, all consequences of war which influence development outcomes. A consideration of how post-conflict development objectives can inform a transitional justice process for Syria identifies key areas of convergence and divergence between the two fields as well as debates pertaining to the prioritisation of justice versus peace, international law, and contextualising strategies to individual states and post-conflict situations. In Syria, where work is already under way by multiple organisations and activist groups to facilitate, gather and document evidence of human rights violations in preparation for a future transitional justice process: a 'good-enough' approach to governance (Grindle, 2004), the strengthening of civil society to provide national level support, and institutional reform are identified as key areas for development intervention. However, the success or otherwise of development interventions in these areas will rely upon a number of critical factors: the willingness of a transitional government to take ownership of post-conflict development and transitional justice processes, facilitate citizen participation by first <b>addressing</b> <b>Syria's</b> severe humanitarian crisis, and accept independent or international involvement where required; the capacity of Syrian civil society to provide national level support following an intense and prolonged period of conflict; the state of Syria's post-conflict physical and human resource; and the willingness of a divided Syrian society to accept cross-community human rights initiatives or a transitional government comprised of any one party where violations have been committed by both sides of the conflict...|$|R
50|$|In January 2016, 112 doctors, {{humanitarian}} workers, {{and civil}} society members in <b>Syria</b> <b>addressed</b> {{an open letter to}} O'Brien criticizing OCHA for failing to meet urgent humanitarian needs created by the Syrian Civil War, citing a report by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon which stated that the combined food, medical aid (insulin), and non-food items to successfully delivered to besieged areas in Syria in 2015 was enough for only 0.7% of the UN’s estimated 212,000 people living under siege.|$|R
50|$|In Syria, {{opposition}} to union with Egypt mounted. Syrian Army officers resented being subordinate to Egyptian officers, and Syrian Bedouin tribes received money from Saudi Arabia {{to prevent them}} from becoming loyal to Nasser. Also, Egyptian-style land reform was resented for damaging Syrian agriculture, the communists began to gain influence, and the intellectuals of the Ba'ath Party who supported the union rejected the one-party system. Mustafa al-Barudi, the Syrian Minister of Propaganda, stated that ‘the smallest member of the (Egyptian) retinue thought that he had inherited our country. Egyptians spread “like octopuses” everywhere.’ Nasser was not able to <b>address</b> problems in <b>Syria</b> completely, because they were new to him, and instead of appointing Syrians to run Syria, he assigned this position to Amer and Sarraj.|$|R
2500|$|On November 24, 2005, Duke visited Damascus, <b>Syria,</b> <b>addressing</b> a rally {{broadcast}} on Syrian television and giving an interview. During the rally, {{he referred to}} Israel as a [...] "war-mongering country" [...] and stated that Zionists [...] "occupy most of the American media and now control much of the American government … It {{is not just the}} West Bank of Palestine, {{it is not just the}} Golan Heights that are occupied by the Zionists, but Washington, D.C., and New York and London and many other capitals of the world." [...] He concluded by stating: [...] "Your fight for freedom is the same as our fight for freedom." [...] In a second interview, he said Israel [...] "makes the Nazi state look very, very moderate." [...] Syrian parliament member Mohammad Habash later stated that Duke's visit gave Syrians a [...] "new and very positive view of the average American." ...|$|R
