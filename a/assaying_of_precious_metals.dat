50|$|In the 1870s and 1880s, <b>assays</b> <b>of</b> <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> in White Chief Canyon and on Empire Mountain {{led to the}} boomtown of Beulah.

The first routing of Mineral King Road followed the East Fork Canyon's south side. Until then, access to Mineral King was by rough tracks. A second {{discovery of}} silver in 1878 drew more prospectors to the Mineral King area and a second Mineral King Road, following a different route up {{the north side of}} the canyon, was constructed in 1879. This created the route for much of the present-day Mineral King Road.|$|R

He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1846. He went into full partnership with George Matthey, a stockbroker, in 1851.

40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} mainly with <b>assaying</b> <b>of</b> <b>precious</b> and noble <b>metals,</b> gold, silver, and platinum group metals. The determination f {{the amount of}} saleable metals (or other mineral products), in an ore {{is the most important}} step in evaluation of a mineral deposit. Most assays, even if well done, will not tell you how the material occurs in the rock or how much of it can be recovered, but if the amount hat is present in the first place is unknown, it is impossible to make any comment as to the efficiency of a recovery system. This may not be important because if a recovery can be made which will provide a large profit, that which is not recovered will not seriously affect the economics of the operation. However, where the grade, and thus the operation is marginal, this is a different matter. Fire assaying, with its origins in antiquity, is widely regarded as the best, if not the only, way to determine <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> in naturally occurring ores. There are a lot of misconcep-tions about the universal applicability <b>of</b> fire <b>assay</b> methods and the more recent combi-nation <b>of</b> traditional fire <b>assay</b> collection techniques with laboratory instrumentation has given rise to a serious, if not ludicrous, situation in the case of some materials...|$|R

The solid waste containing <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> first is dissolved by the solution somprising oxidation agents and ligands, such as aqua regia, Cl 2 +HCL and NaCN+O 2. The separation <b>of</b> <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> in the leached solution or wasted solution {{is carried out}} by using various methods like classic precipitation, cementation, ion exchange resin, activated carbon adsorption and solvent extraction.
