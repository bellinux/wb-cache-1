Chen Yonglin, the defector from the Chinese consulate in Sydney, said in 2005 that approximately 800 Australian Falun Gong practitioners had been blacklisted (Chen claimed {{he sought to}} remove most of these names).|$|E

Arriving early, they settle down in the comfortable surroundings and quickly become friends. While clinking their champagne glasses, they inadvertently cause an avalanche that buries the entire cabin. The two make several attempts at escaping but are unsuccessful. The other employees reach {{what appears to be}} their destination; however, it is actually a ranger station and they begin to realize that something bad has happened to their colleagues.|$|E

5|$|New Guinea {{crocodiles}} have {{a mostly}} aquatic lifestyle and are largely nocturnal. They {{spend much of}} the day underwater, often with their nostrils and eyes above the surface. Powerful side-to-side movements of their tails propel them through the water <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>use</b> both tail and legs to steer. When on land, they favour shady, dense areas of undergrowth. They tend to bask in a group during the day, dispersing at night to feed.|$|E
5|$|A {{composite}} of Perrault's male heroes, however, indicates {{the opposite of}} his heroines: his male characters are not particularly handsome, but they are active, brave, ambitious, and deft, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>use</b> their wit, intelligence, and great civility {{to work their way}} up the social ladder and to achieve their goals. In this case of course, it is the cat who displays the characteristics and the man benefits from his trickery and skills. Unlike the tales dealing with submissive heroines waiting for marriage, the male-centered tales suggest social status and achievement are more important than marriage for men. The virtues of Perrault's heroes reflect upon the bourgeoisie of the court of Louis XIV and upon the nature of Perrault, who was a successful civil servant in France during the seventeenth century.|$|E
5|$|Before {{leaving the}} next morning, the Doctor stops to ask Emma {{if she could}} sense {{anything}} unusual about Clara, but Emma reveals that Clara seems normal to her. The Doctor offers Hila a lift to any other place in history and concludes {{that she is a}} direct descendant of Emma and Palmer. He reasons that their relation resulted in a blood connection that helped them open the gateway to rescue her. While contemplating the bonds that love can create, the Doctor suddenly realises that there is another creature within Caliburn House. Just as Emma and Palmer were not part of a ghost story but a love story, the Doctor considers the same for the creatures — that the one trapped in the pocket universe has been trying to reunite with its mate. The Doctor asks Emma for a favour <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>use</b> Emma and the TARDIS to retrieve the other creature from the pocket universe.|$|E

5|$|In adults, {{blood lead}} levels {{steadily}} increase with increasing age. In adults of all ages, men have higher blood lead levels than women do. Children {{are more sensitive}} to elevated blood lead levels than adults are. Children may also have a higher intake of lead than adults; they breathe faster and {{may be more likely}} to have contact with and ingest soil. Children of ages one to three tend to have the highest blood lead levels, possibly because at that age they begin to walk and explore their environment, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>use</b> their mouths in their exploration. Blood levels usually peak at about 18–24months old. In many countries including the US, household paint and dust are the major route of exposure in children.|$|E

Pashtun scholars such as Abdul Hai Habibi and others believe that the earliest Pashto work dates back to Amir Kror Suri, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>use</b> the writings found in Pata Khazana as proof. Amir Kror Suri, son of Amir Polad Suri, was an 8th-century folk hero and king from the Ghor region in Afghanistan. However, this is disputed by several European experts due to lack of strong evidence.|$|E
25|$|Carnivory rarely pays, so even {{carnivorous}} plants {{avoid it}} {{when there is}} too little light or an easier source of nutrients, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>use</b> as few carnivorous features as are required {{at a given time}} or for a given prey item. There are very few habitats stressful enough to make investing biomass and energy in trigger hairs and enzymes worthwhile. Many plants occasionally benefit from animal protein rotting on their leaves, but carnivory that is obvious enough for the casual observer to notice is rare.|$|E
25|$|High Performance {{dinghies}} {{are fast}} and powerful dinghies designed for racing around an Olympic triangle (Olympic Racing Course). Examples of such dinghies are the International Flying Dutchman, the International 505, the Jet 14, the Fireball, the Osprey, the Thistle, the 14ft John Spencer Javelin and the International 470. They can all plane easily, even upwind <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>use</b> trapeze and a symmetric spinnaker. Not all are two handed boats: the International Contender and the RS600 are high performance single handed boats {{equipped with a}} trapeze, but not a spinnaker, and demonstrate a comparable performance. Skiffs are usually classed as High performance dinghies.|$|E

25|$|Kodiak bears begin {{entering}} their dens in late October. Pregnant sows {{are usually}} {{the first to go}} to dens; males are the last. Males begin emerging from their dens in early April, while sows with new cubs may stay in dens until late June. Bears living on the north end of Kodiak Island tend to have longer denning periods than bears in the southern areas. Most Kodiak bears dig their dens in hill or mountain sides <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>use</b> a wide variety of denning habitats depending on which part of the archipelago they live. Almost a quarter of the adult bears forgo denning, staying somewhat active throughout the winter.|$|E
25|$|The {{jumping spider}} family (Salticidae) {{contains}} over 600 described genera {{and more than}} 5800 described species, making it the largest family of spiders with about 13% of all species. Jumping spiders {{have some of the}} best vision among arthropods and use it in courtship, hunting, and navigation. Although they normally move unobtrusively and fairly slowly, most species are capable of very agile jumps, notably when hunting, but sometimes in response to sudden threats or crossing long gaps. Both their book lungs and tracheal system are well-developed, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>use</b> both systems (bimodal breathing). Jumping spiders are generally recognized by their eye pattern. All jumping spiders have four pairs of eyes, with the anterior median pair being particularly large.|$|E

25|$|The Tripuris live on {{the slopes}} of hills in a group of five to fifty families. Their houses in these areas are built of bamboo or ua as it is called in Kokborok and raised five to six feet height to save {{themselves}} from the dangers of the wild animals. Nowadays a considerable section of this community are living in the plains and erecting houses like the plains people, adopting their methods of cultivation, and following them in other aspects of life, such as dress, manners, and cosmetics. Tripuri women wear a scarp, called rignai, which reaches down just below the knee. They weave in their loin-loom a small piece of cloth, which they call risa, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>use</b> this small piece of cloth as their breast garment.|$|E
25|$|The second {{trophic level}} (primary consumers) is {{occupied}} by zooplankton which feed off the phytoplankton. Together with the phytoplankton, they form {{the base of the}} food pyramid that supports most of the world's great fishing grounds. Zooplankton are tiny animals found with the phytoplankton in oceanic surface waters, and include tiny crustaceans, and fish larvae and fry (recently hatched fish). Most zooplankton are filter feeders, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>use</b> appendages to strain the phytoplankton in the water. Some larger zooplankton also feed on smaller zooplankton. Some zooplankton can jump about a bit to avoid predators, but they can't really swim. Like phytoplankton, they float with the currents, tides and winds instead. Zooplanktons can reproduce rapidly, their populations can increase up to thirty percent a day under favourable conditions. Many live short and productive lives and reach maturity quickly.|$|E
25|$|Alternative local {{names for}} the burial mound are the 'Jockey's cap' and the 'Monk's Graveyard', the 1897 OS map states that human bones {{were found in the}} hill. The Forrest family of Byres Farm are direct {{descendants}} of the Templetons <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>use</b> the term 'Monk's Graveyard' for the Chapel Hill. The validity of oral tradition in this case is exceptionally strong and may indicate that the chapel was not on the mound but {{on the site of the}} old Chapelton House. John Dobie in his additional notes to his father's work calls the site 'the Chapeltons'. The mound itself is one of the finest preserved Bronze Age burial mounds in Ayrshire. A previous owner of the Chapel Hill mound allowed an unofficial excavation to take place in around 2001. It is not known if any finds were made.|$|E
