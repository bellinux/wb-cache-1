5|$|After A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, and <b>A</b> <b>Storm</b> <b>of</b> Swords, Martin {{originally}} intended to write three more books. The fourth book, tentatively titled A Dance with Dragons, was to focus on Daenerys Targaryen's return to Westeros and the associated conflicts. Martin wanted to set this story five years after <b>A</b> <b>Storm</b> <b>of</b> Swords so that the younger characters could grow older and the dragons grow larger. Agreeing with his publishers early on that the new book should be shorter than <b>A</b> <b>Storm</b> <b>of</b> Swords, Martin set out to write the novel closer in length to A Clash of Kings. A long prologue was to establish {{what had happened in}} the meantime, initially just as one chapter of Aeron Damphair on the Iron Islands at the Kingsmoot. Since the events on the Iron Islands were to have an impact in the book and could not be told with existing POV characters, Martin eventually introduced three new viewpoints.|$|E

5|$|The work {{is opened}} by a Sinfonia {{similar to the}} one of the cantata , {{possibly}} the slow movement of a concerto for oboe and violin. A sighing motif, the picture of <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> <b>of</b> tears, and the flood image conjured by the upwelling music characterizes the dark and oppressive feeling.|$|E

5|$|Following popular {{television}} {{appearances and}} concerts during their February 1964 visit, the Beatles {{returned to the}} United States in August 1964, and again in August 1965, for tours. In August 1966 they returned once more, and although this tour was commercially successful, it coincided with <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> <b>of</b> U.S. public protest after publication of a quote from John Lennon's remarks about Christianity. The 1966 U.S. tour {{marked the end of}} the Beatles' concert days. The band ceased to perform commercial concerts, instead devoting their efforts to creating new material in the recording studio.|$|E
5|$|In February 1846 Stone intimated to Abby Kelley Foster {{that she}} was {{thinking}} of becoming a public speaker, but not until the following summer did <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> <b>of</b> controversy over Foster’s speaking at Oberlin decide the matter for her. Faculty opposition to Foster ignited impassioned discussion of women’s rights among the students, especially of woman’s right to speak in public, which Stone vigorously defended in a joint meeting of the men’s and women’s literary societies. She followed that campus demonstration by making her first public speech at Oberlin’s August 1 commemoration of Emancipation in the West Indies.|$|E
5|$|In March 2006 {{the book}} Game of Shadows, written by Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada, was {{released}} amid <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> <b>of</b> media publicity including {{the cover of}} Sports Illustrated. Initially small excerpts of the book were released by the authors in the issue of Sports Illustrated. The book alleges Bonds used stanozolol {{and a host of}} other steroids, and is perhaps most responsible for the change in public opinion regarding Bonds's steroid use.|$|E

500|$|The highest storm tide {{noted in}} {{historical}} accounts {{was produced by}} the 1899 Cyclone Mahina, estimated at almost 44ft (13metres) at Bathurst Bay, Australia, but research published in 2000 concluded {{that the majority of}} this likely was wave run-up because of the steep coastal topography. In the United States, one of the greatest recorded storm surges was generated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which produced <b>a</b> maximum <b>storm</b> surge <b>of</b> more than 25ft (8metres) in southern Mississippi, with <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> surge height <b>of</b> 27.8ft (8.5m) [...] in Pass Christian. Another record storm surge occurred in this same area from Hurricane Camille in 1969, with <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> tide <b>of</b> 24.6ft (7.5m), also at Pass Christian. [...] <b>A</b> <b>storm</b> surge <b>of</b> 14ft (4.2m) occurred in New York City during Hurricane Sandy in October 2012.|$|R
5|$|Libby {{started the}} first Environmental Engineering program at UCLA in 1972. As {{a member of}} the California Air Resources Board, he worked to develop and improve California's air {{pollution}} standards. He established a research program to investigate heterogeneous catalysis with the idea of reducing emissions from motor vehicles through more complete fuel combustion. The election of Richard Nixon as president in 1968 generated speculation that Libby might be appointed as Presidential Science Advisor. There was <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> <b>of</b> protest from scientists who felt that Libby was too conservative, and the offer was not made.|$|E
5|$|Seasons 1 and 2 (2011–12) {{follow the}} events of A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings, respectively. The plot of <b>A</b> <b>Storm</b> <b>of</b> Swords was split into seasons 3 and 4 (2013–14). Both season 5 and season 6 adapt {{material}} from A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons, novels whose plots run concurrently and each contain different characters. Though the HBO series has alternately extended, abbreviated, conflated and diverged from the novels' plot lines, Tyrion's character and story arc have remained mostly consistent with Martin's writing.|$|E
5|$|Through 1935, as {{the breakup}} {{legislation}} wound through Congress, and litigation through the courts, Willkie was the industry's chief spokesman and lobbyist. When the Senate narrowly {{passed a bill}} for the breakup, Willkie {{made a series of}} speeches asking the public to oppose the legislation, and <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> <b>of</b> letters to congressmen followed. After the House of Representatives defeated the breakup clause, investigation proved that many of these communications were funded by the electric companies, signed with names taken from the telephone book, though Willkie was not implicated. Amid public anger, Roosevelt pressured Congress to pass a bill requiring the breakup to take place within three years.|$|E

5|$|Typically, {{tropical}} cyclones do {{not form}} in the South Atlantic Ocean, due to strong upper level shear, cool water temperatures, {{and the lack of}} a convergence zone of convection. Occasionally though, as seen in 1991 and early 2004, conditions can become slightly more favorable. For Catarina, {{it was a combination of}} climatic and atmospheric anomalies. Water temperatures on Catarina's path ranged from 24 to 25°C, slightly less than the 26.5°C temperature of a normal tropical cyclone, but sufficient for <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> <b>of</b> baroclinic origin.|$|E
5|$|A congratulatory {{telegram}} to Kruger from Kaiser Wilhelm II on 3 January prompted <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> <b>of</b> anti-Boer and anti-German {{feeling in}} Britain, with Jameson becoming lionised as a result. Kruger shouted down {{talk of the}} death penalty for the imprisoned Jameson or a campaign of retribution against Johannesburg, challenging his more bellicose commandants to depose him if they disagreed, and accepted Robinson's proposed mediation with alacrity. After confiscating the weapons and munitions the Reform Committee had stockpiled, Kruger handed Jameson and his troops over to British custody and granted amnesty to all the Johannesburg conspirators except for 64 leading members, who were charged with high treason. The four main leaders—Lionel Phillips, John Hays Hammond, George Farrar and Frank Rhodes (brother of Cecil)—pleaded guilty in April 1896 and were sentenced to hang, but Kruger quickly had this commuted to fines of £25,000 each.|$|E
5|$|A public {{announcement}} of the new pieces was made on May 15, 1965, only to be met with <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> <b>of</b> objections. Both the public and many congressmen saw the issue as a poor use of Mint resources {{at a time of}} severe coin shortages, which would only benefit coin dealers. On May 24, one day before a hastily called congressional hearing, Adams announced that the pieces were deemed trial strikes, never intended for circulation. The Mint later stated that 316,076 pieces had been struck; all were reported melted amid heavy security. To ensure {{that there would be no}} repetition, Congress inserted a provision in the Coinage Act of 1965 forbidding the coinage of silver dollars for five years. That act also removed silver from the dime and quarter, and reduced the silver content of the half dollar to 40%.|$|E
50|$|This had the all too {{predictable}} effect <b>of</b> provoking <b>a</b> fresh <b>storm</b> <b>of</b> agitation. The League immediately organised <b>a</b> fresh <b>storm</b> <b>of</b> agitation. The League immediately organised another protest, {{to be held}} in Johannesburg on 14 January. This time, {{in order}} to keep within the law (which banned unlicensed outdoor meetings), the League proposed to hold it in an enclosed space (a large circus building known as the Amphitheatre).|$|R

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>storm</b> <b>of</b> {{potentially}} Cape Verde origin {{was detected}} in the Virgin Islands at 1800UTC on August5. Initially moving westward, the tropical storm gradually gained in intensity before making a sharp curve towards the north on August8. The storm continued in a northerly motion before a second curvature brought it in a generally westward direction on August9. Shortly after, the tropical storm reached hurricane intensity as a modern-day Category1hurricane. The hurricane eventually made landfall at peak intensity on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina at 2030UTC on September21. At the time, the storm had maximum sustained winds of 100mph (155km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 972mbar (hPa; 28.71inHg), equivalent to a modern-day Category2hurricane. Once inland, the tropical cyclone gradually weakened, and recurved northeastward before dissipating over the Appalachian Mountains on August14.|$|E
5|$|As {{the allies}} began {{to put their}} {{artillery}} into place, the British kept up a steady fire to disrupt them. British fire increased on the 2nd and the allies suffered moderate casualties. General Washington continued to make visits to the front, despite concern shown by several of his officers over the increasing enemy fire. On the night of October 2, the British opened <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> <b>of</b> fire {{to cover up the}} movement of the British cavalry to Gloucester where they were to escort infantrymen on a foraging party. On the 3rd, the foraging party, led by Banastre Tarleton, went out but collided with Lauzun's Legion, and John Mercer's Virginia militia, led by the Marquis de Choisy. The British cavalry quickly retreated back behind their defensive lines, losing 50 men.|$|E
5|$|Continuing west-northwestward, Karen {{attained}} {{its peak}} intensity on November 13 {{with a central}} pressure of 894 mb (hPa; 26.40 inHg). Between November 13 and 14, Karen gradually turned towards the north as it underwent another eyewall replacement cycle. During this time, Karen finally weakened below Category 5 status as its winds dropped below 251 km/h (156 mph). This {{marked the end of}} its near-record 4.25-day span as <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> <b>of</b> such intensity, second only to Typhoon Nancy of 1961 which maintained Category 5 status for 5.5 days. Over the following days, the typhoon's structure gradually became disorganized, with its eye no longer well-defined by November 15. By this time, Karen began accelerating northeastward and later east-northeastward over the open ocean. The combination of its rapid movement and entrainment of cold air into the circulation ultimately caused the system to transition into an extratropical cyclone on November 17. The remnants of Karen continued tracking east-northeast and were last noted by the JTWC on November 18 roughly halfway between the southern Aleutian Islands and northern Hawaiian Islands.|$|E

5|$|Finally in 1859, Marx {{published}} A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, {{his first}} serious economic work. This work was intended {{merely as a}} preview of his three-volume Das Kapital (English title: Capital: Critique of Political Economy), which he intended to publish at a later date. In A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, Marx accepts the labour theory of value as advocated by David Ricardo, but whereas Ricardo drew a distinction between use value and value in commodities, Ricardo always {{had been unable to}} define the real relationship between use value and value. The reasoning Marx laid out in his book clearly delineated the true relationship between use value and value. He also produced a truly scientific theory of money and money circulation in the capitalist economy, thus A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy created <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> <b>of</b> enthusiasm when it appeared in public and the entire edition of the book was sold out quickly.|$|E
5|$|Gay {{characters}} {{also were}} often killed {{off at the}} end, such as the death of Sandy Dennis' character {{at the end of}} The Fox in 1968. If not victims, lesbians were depicted as villains or morally corrupt, such as portrayals of brothel madames by Barbara Stanwyck in Walk on the Wild Side from 1962 and Shelley Winters in The Balcony in 1963. Lesbians as predators were presented in Rebecca (1940), women's prison films like Caged (1950), or in the character Rosa Klebb in From Russia with Love (1963). Lesbian vampire themes have reappeared in Dracula's Daughter (1936), Blood and Roses (1960), Vampyros Lesbos (1971), and The Hunger (1983). Basic Instinct (1992) featured a bisexual murderer played by Sharon Stone; it was one of several films that set off <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> <b>of</b> protests about the depiction of gays as predators.|$|E
5|$|In 1817, John Wood died in {{the midst}} of a {{financial}} scandal, and Bute decided to appoint two of his rivals to the posts of Constable and Cardiff's Town Clerk. This would have reaffirmed Bute's power to change the appointments and broken the Wood's family hold on local power, but it provoked <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> <b>of</b> local political wrangling. The Wood family turned on Bute, arguing that he should abandon his claims to control local Welsh affairs from Scotland. Bute replied by trying to crush the Wood family's bank and stacking the town council with his appointees in early 1818. The Woods successfully took legal action, challenging Bute's authority to take these actions, and anti-Bute violence flared that summer, resulting in arrests by Special Constables appointed by Bute. The pro-Bute faction in Cardiff rallied and the Woods were defeated at the Parliamentary elections that year, the results reaffirming Bute's authority over the town council.|$|E
