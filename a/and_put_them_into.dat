5|$|Each level casts {{players as}} a {{different}} colored Yoshi, who must escort Baby Mario {{on his back}} and reach the end of the level, where he is passed on to the next Yoshi. Similar to Super Mario World, Yoshi can use his tongue to ensnare enemies <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> his mouth. When something is in his mouth, Yoshi can either spit it out as an attack, or swallow it to turn it into an egg. These eggs can then be thrown at an angle, even bouncing off walls, to attack enemies or reach far away or hard to reach items. Yoshi can carry up to six eggs at a time, with some colored eggs spawning items once they hit something. Yoshi can also eat watermelons that let him spit out seeds, or flaming enemies that let him spit out fire. Yoshi is also able to perform a flutter jump, in which he can kick his legs in mid-air to gain extra height or hover over long distances, and a ground pound, a downward attack that can hammer down on enemies and stumps.|$|E
5|$|Fifty light {{infantry}} {{men were}} in pursuit of Mercer's men when a fresh brigade of 1,100 militiamen {{under the command of}} Cadwalader appeared. Mawhood gathered his men who were all over the battlefield <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> battle line formation. Meanwhile, Sullivan was at a standoff with the detachment of the 55th Regiment that had come to assist the 40th Regiment, neither daring to move towards the main battle for risk of exposing its flank. Cadwalader attempted to move his men into a battle line but they had no combat experience and did not know even the most basic military maneuvers. When his men {{reached the top of the}} hill and saw Mercer's men fleeing from the British, most of the militia turned around and ran back down the hill.|$|E

To prepare for their roles in the film, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta often spoke with Pileggi, who shared research material left over from writing the book. According to Pesci, improvisation and ad-libbing came out of rehearsals wherein Scorsese gave the actors freedom {{to do whatever they}} wanted. The director made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines he liked best, <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> a revised script, which the cast worked from during principal photography.|$|E

His first goal came in Australia's first match, against India, with a left-footed shot from outside the penalty area. Kewell's second goal came in Australia's quarter-final match against Iraq with a header in the 118th minute in extra-time, which gave Australia a 1–0 win <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> the semi-finals of the Asian Cup {{for the first time in}} Australia's history.

25|$|At a sysop {{meeting in}} Dallas, {{the idea was}} raised {{that it would be}} nice if there was some way for the sysops to post {{messages}} that would be shared among the systems. In February 1986 Jeff Rush, one of the group members, introduced a new mailer that extracted messages from public forums that the sysop selected, in a manner similar to the way the original mailer handled private messages. The new program was known as a tosser/scanner. The tosser produced a file that was similar (or identical) to the output from the normal netmail scan, however, these files were then compressed and attached to a normal netmail message as an attachment. This message was then sent to a special address on the remote system. After receiving netmail as normal, the scanner on the remote system looked for these messages, unpacked them, <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> the same public forum on the original system.|$|E
25|$|In 1924, Ekebergbanen bought four Berliet buses with {{bodies from}} Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> service on two lines, from Jernbanetorget to Abildsø and from Sæter to Godheim. The latter route {{was used to}} feed the Ekeberg Line. In 1927, the company bought Republic and Studebaker buses, and in 1928 four Büssing buses which {{replaced}} the Berliet vehicles. From 1927 to 1931, the company ran a bus line from Jernbanetorget to Simensbråten, and also for some years from Nordstrandshøgda to Aker University Hospital. From 28 August 1932, the two original bus lines were combined and extended to Sværsvann. It was branded as Østmarkaruten and ran the route Jernbanetorget–Abildsø–Klemetsrud–Godheim–Sværsvann. In 1937, the company bought four diesel buses from Büssing. In 1940, the company had four modern diesel buses and three older gasoline buses. The company had silver buses with a wine red cheatline with the EB logo in silver on a blue background. The company also ran an automotive workshop and fuel station at Holtet.|$|E

[...] Although {{the characters in the}} play, named by university professors, share names with Chekhov characters, they are not the same characters. They share some elements but are fully imagined. Durang mentioned that Masha is more like Madame Arkadina in The Seagull than any of Chekhov's characters named Masha. Rather than mimic Three Sisters, his play has a sister, brother and adopted sister, with the latter two being the most Chekhovian of the title characters. Durang has described Nina as most like a Chekhov character, and related to the character of the same name in The Seagull. After five marriages to her contemporaries, Masha has taken up with Spike in a May–December relationship. Durang says that [...] "Cassandra, who's a cleaning woman and soothsayer, is like the Greek-tragedy Cassandra. In some ways, she's like the nanny in Vanya, but she doesn't reflect Chekhov as much." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian" [...] {{features}} {{one of the}} few permanent character {{changes in}} the series when Lisa officially becomes a vegetarian. The episode had been pitched by David S. Cohen and the producers felt it would be a surefire way to get Paul McCartney to guest star. McCartney agreed, but only on the condition that Lisa stay a vegetarian and not revert. [...] "22 Short Films About Springfield" [...] has twelve credited writers, the most of any episode of the series. The episode features multiple stories about different characters. To decide who would write each of the segments, all of the writers chose their top three favorite characters <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> a hat, the names were drawn out and the writers were assigned their parts and Greg Daniels put all of the segments together and ordered them. The only major recurring characters who were introduced this season were Disco Stu, who appeared in [...] "Two Bad Neighbors," [...] and Brandine Spuckler, who appeared in [...] "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield". Two more episodes, [...] "You Only Move Twice" [...] and [...] "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer" [...] were produced as part of the season seven (3Fxx) production run, but both aired the following season.|$|E
500|$|The writers {{ensured that}} {{although}} they were changing the storyline circumstances, the characters remained the same with minimal changes to their personalities. According to series writer Matt Berry, the time jump allowed the writers {{to work with the}} characters [...] "without most of the baggage they’d accumulated in the earlier years, <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> starting places so we could move them forward and build in new story arcs." [...] For this reason, the writers treated the season premiere as a pilot, in which, according to Daily, they [...] "could give the women a new drive." [...] Daily identified the Susan character as having undergone the greatest change, stating that she has given up on looking for a [...] "fairy-tale romance" [...] and is emotionally distant in her new relationship. He also stated that the character of Gabrielle has dealt with the biggest change in terms of her circumstances, as she continues to deal with her husband's blindness and their financial problems. Actress Eva Longoria had to gain weight and wear additional body padding for her character's new storyline. Dana Delany stated that her character, Katherine, who was portrayed as an antiheroine in the previous season, is more relaxed following the time jump. However, Delany clarified that while Katherine is now friends with the other characters, she and Bree would become frenemies {{as a result of their}} business partnership. Nicollette Sheridan, commented that Edie, who played an integral role in the season's mystery story arch, is [...] "a lot more conscientious about things , without losing her comedic edge." ...|$|E

Two months later, after the OH-6s had established a presence in Laos, the 500Ps were smuggled into Laos to continue training at a remote base near Pakse, called PS-44. Here, the Chinese pilots proved unequal to their task. When a Chinese pilot crashed one of the 500Ps in a night landing, the dispute-riven Chinese contingent was cut from the project. Two of the Air America pilots would fly the infiltration mission into North Vietnam instead.|$|E
2500|$|According to Carol Anderson, {{the four}} truths have [...] "a {{singular}} {{position within the}} Theravada canon and tradition."

[...] This liberation can be attained in one single moment, when the four truths are understood together. Within the Theravada tradition, great emphasis is placed upon reading and contemplating The Discourse That Sets Turning the Wheel of Truth, and other suttas, {{as a means to}} study the four noble truths <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> practice.

2500|$|De Havilland {{initiated}} a private venture night fighter, the DH.113 intended for export, fitting a two-seat cockpit closely {{based on that}} of the Mosquito night fighter, and a lengthened nose that accommodated an AI Mk X radar. An order to supply the Egyptian Air Force was received, but this was blocked by the British government {{as part of a}} general ban on supplying arms to Egypt. Instead, the RAF took over the order <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> service as an interim measure between the retirement of the de Havilland Mosquito night fighter and the full introduction of the Meteor night fighter. [...] Removal of the radar from the night fighter and fitting of dual controls resulted in a jet trainer model of the aircraft, the DH.115 Vampire which entered British service as the Vampire T.11. This trainer variant was built in large numbers, both for the RAF and for export.|$|E
2500|$|On 18 August Rook, {{still on}} her way to Britain with despatches, had the misfortune (having dodged one threat) to meet with two French privateers off Cape St. Nicholas (San Domingo). The larger French {{schooner}} carried 12 guns and the smaller schooner [...] 10 guns. An unusually accurate shot by Lieutenant Lawrence killed the captain of the largest privateer. After an hour-and-a-half hard fighting, the two privateers succeeded in taking Rook by boarding her. In all, she had three crew members killed, including Lawrence, killed by a musket shot, and 11 wounded (including the Master's Mate - the second in command). The French stripped the survivors naked, including the wounded, <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> a boat.

Fortunately, the four unwounded men were able to bring the boat to land where they encountered hospitable natives.|$|E
2500|$|According to Pesci, {{improvisation}} and ad-libbing {{came out}} of rehearsals wherein Scorsese let the actors do whatever they wanted. He made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines the actors {{came up with that}} he liked best, <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> a revised script that the cast worked from during principal photography. For example, the scene where Tommy tells a story and Henry is responding to him — the [...] "Funny how? Do I amuse you?" [...] scene — is based on an actual event that happened to Pesci. It was worked on in rehearsals where he and Liotta improvised, and Scorsese recorded four to five takes, rewrote their dialogue, and inserted it into the script. The dinner scene with Tommy's mother was largely improvised. Her painting of the bearded man with the dogs was based on a photograph from National Geographic magazine. The cast did not meet Henry Hill during the film's shoot until a few weeks before it premiered. Liotta met him in an undisclosed city; Hill had seen the film and told the actor that he loved it.|$|E
