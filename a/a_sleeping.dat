Horses can also fell a tree by eating through the trunk.|$|E

She awoke sometime between 10 and 10:20a.m. to find him sleeping normally in bed next to her.

5|$|Further {{marketing}} of Sleeping Dogs was via cross-promotion on different platforms; players {{who bought the}} game through Steam received an eight item pack for Team Fortress 2, which was later made available for separate purchase, and a Hong Kong-themed Team Fortress 2 level, Kong King.

The comment resulted in Manning being ordered to strip naked in her cell that night and sleep without clothing. On the following morning only, Manning stood naked for inspection. Following her lawyer's protest and media attention, Manning was issued <b>a</b> <b>sleeping</b> garment on or before March 11.|$|E
