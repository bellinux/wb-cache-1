He later married their sister Mildred. The trio moved their parents and sister to New York, and soon older sister Edith and her husband {{followed}} to be near them. The family remained very close, living either {{in the same house}} or within a few blocks of each other throughout most of their career. The family's closeness was reflected in the style of their performance, which was always family-friendly and had a certain wholesomeness that was appealing to much of their audience.|$|E

And I'll do stuff that I'm totally joking and they're like (uses mean girl voice), [...] "Why is she doing that? Why is she doing the treadmill with her high heels on?"

500|$|As a person, Kubrick was {{described}} by Norman Lloyd as [...] "a very dark, sort of a glowering type who was very serious". Marisa Berenson, who starred in Barry Lyndon fondly recalled: [...] "There was great tenderness in {{him and he was}} passionate about his work. What was striking was his enormous intelligence, but he also had <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor.</b> He was a very shy person and self-protective, but he was filled with the thing that drove him twenty-four hours of the day." [...] Kubrick was particularly fond of machines and technical equipment, to the point that his wife Christiane once stated that [...] "Stanley would be happy with eight tape recorders and one pair of pants". Although Kubrick had obtained a pilot's license in August 1947, some have claimed that he later developed a fear of flying, stemming from an incident in the early 1950s when a colleague had been killed in a plane crash. Kubrick had been sent the charred remains of his camera and notebooks which, according to Duncan, traumatized him for life. Kubrick also had a strong mistrust of doctors and medicine, especially those he did not know, and on one occasion he had a dentist from the Bronx flown to London to treat him.|$|E

500|$|Upon the {{suggestion}} of Universal Studios, Roach cast De Niro {{in the role of}} Jack Byrnes due to critical acclaim of De Niro's recent comedy work in films such as Analyze This and in the live-action/animated film The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle. De Niro's character Jack Byrnes is Pam's father and a retired CIA operative who is overly protective of his family and has a hard time warming up to his daughters' love interests. The script was not written with De Niro in mind as Jack Byrnes; the first draft of the script was completed in 1996, three years before De Niro appeared in Analyze This. However, shortly after De Niro finished filming The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, Universal suggested to Roach that he should cast De Niro for the role to which Roach agrees that he had [...] "no reservations whatsoever." [...] In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, De Niro stated that he was in active pursuit of comedic roles since Analyze This. Admitting that he had initial reservations about starring in Meet the Parents, De Niro said that he felt [...] "pushed into it" [...] due to insistence by Jane Rosenthal—De Niro's partner in TriBeCa Productions who also acted as one of the producers of Meet the Parents. Screenwriter Jim Herzfeld and director Jay Roach both confirmed that, after committing to the project and reviewing the script, Robert De Niro was actually the person {{who came up with the}} idea for the famous polygraph test scene. Asked about working with De Niro given the serious nature of his previous roles, Ben Stiller said that [...] "it was a little bit intimidating working with De Niro" [...] but that he [...] "has <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> and I think that's the biggest surprise about him." ...|$|E
500|$|Musicians Kid Rock and Joe C. guest {{starred in}} the episode as themselves, {{performing}} at the annual spring break concert that Homer sneaks out to attend. When Joe C. makes his first appearance on stage in the episode, Homer mistakes him for a child that has lost his parents. After performing his song [...] "Bawitdaba", Kid Rock tells the audience {{that he is going}} to pour out forty gallons of malt liquor on the curb as a way of showing respect to his homies that could not make it to the concert. When Homer hears this he starts to drink the malt liquor. Just as Kid Rock and Joe C. are about to stop him by hurling Joe C. (now wearing a spiked helmet) at him with a slingshot, the sheriff arrives and settles the situation. Scully said in an interview with the Detroit Free Press that the staff of the show chose Kid Rock and Joe C. for the episode because the two [...] "have a lot of stage presence" [...] and visually are [...] "a funny combination," [...] and because the staff thought [...] "they would be funny playing off Homer." [...] According to Scully, the two musicians [...] "had <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> [...] about themselves," [...] with Kid Rock asking if [...] "he could add a couple of his own lines. He wanted to introduce himself as 'the pimp of the nation.' We kept that in the show. It's quite a title." [...] Kid Rock recorded some of his dialog over the phone, but also paid a 45-minute visit to the Simpsons studio in Los Angeles to record lines. Scully thought it looked like the singer enjoyed the experience and was surprised to see that he arrived on time. [...] "My first reaction to that was, 'What kind of rock star is this?'," [...] Scully jokingly told the Detroit Free Press. All of Joe C.'s lines were recorded over the phone.|$|E
2500|$|Holliday {{has been}} married twice. In March 1991, just two months after she met keyboardist Billy Meadows in a nightclub where she was singing, they married. [...] "He had <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> and he made me laugh all the time," [...] Holliday says of her first husband. [...] "I had been feeling bad for so long, I wanted to laugh." [...] But in December 1991, just nine months later, they divorced; the marriage, {{according}} to Holliday, [...] "ran out of steam." [...] She explained of Meadows: [...] "We just didn't know each other well enough." ...|$|E

[...] About 500 people {{attended}} Bat Masterson's funeral service at Frank E. Campbell's Funeral Church at Broadway and 66th Street. [...] Masterson's honorary pall bearers included Damon Runyon (1880–1946), George [...] "Tex" [...] Rickard (1870–1929), and William Eugene Lewis (1861–1924). Runyon was [...] {{a close friend of}} Masterson's and offered this memorable eulogy: [...] "He was a 100 percent, 22-karat real man. Bat was a good hater and a wonderful friend. He was always stretching out his hand to some down-and-outer. He had <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> and a marvelous fund of reminiscence, {{and was one of the}} most entertaining companions we have ever known. There are only too few men in the world like Bat Masterson and his death is a genuine loss." [...] Masterson was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx. [...] His full name, William Barclay Masterson, appears above his epitaph on the large granite grave marker in Woodlawn. Masterson's epitaph states that he was [...] "Loved by Everyone".|$|E
