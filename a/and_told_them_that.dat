5|$|Evans {{was killed}} by police on 5 January 1976, {{at his home in}} Los Angeles. Officers were called when his girlfriend phoned the police <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> Evans was {{confused}} and had a gun. The police mistook the air rifle Evans was holding for a rifle and shot him dead.|$|E
5|$|Benicio del Toro as Fred Fenster. Spacey {{suggested}} del Toro for the role. The {{character was}} originally written with a Harry Dean Stanton-type actor in mind. Del Toro met with Singer and the film's casting director <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> {{he did not}} want to audition because he did not feel comfortable doing them. After reading the script, del Toro realized that his character's only purpose was to be killed to demonstrate Söze's power, and did not have any meaningful impact on the story. As a result, del Toro developed Fenster's unique, garbled speech pattern to make him more memorable as a character.|$|E
5|$|Girl Pat left Grimsby on 1 April 1936. According to Stone's later account, {{when they}} entered the open sea, Orsborne {{assembled}} the crew—except for Jefferson—in the wheelhouse <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> {{this would not be}} a normal fishing trip. Instead, he proposed to take the boat south, first calling at Dover where he would get rid of Jefferson, who was not included in his further plans. At this stage Orsborne was apparently undecided as to his longer-term intentions, but indicated that they would be sailing into southern waters and might go fishing for pearls.|$|E

5|$|Groves retired {{at the end}} of February 1948, and Nichols was {{designated}} as his successor with the rank of major general. At the same time, Forrestal, now the Secretary of Defense, reorganized the Military Liaison Committee. A civilian, Donald F. Carpenter, replaced Brereton as chairman, and there were now two members from each of the three services. On 11 March, Truman summoned Lilienthal, Nichols and Secretary of the Army Kenneth C. Royall to his office, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> he expected the AFSWP and the AEC to cooperate.|$|E
5|$|When rehearsals {{opened in}} September 1955, Rodgers {{assembled}} the cast <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> {{he was going}} into {{the hospital for a}} minor operation. In fact, Rodgers had been diagnosed with cancer of the jawbone. He spent the weekend before the operation writing one final song for Pipe Dream. The surgery required removal of part of the jawbone and tongue, and some of the lymph nodes. The operation took place on September 21, 1955; within ten days of the operation he was back in the theatre watching rehearsals, though for some time only as a spectator.|$|E
5|$|During the evening, {{elements}} of Morgan's army had advanced to within five miles (8km) of Corydon. The four Legion {{companies that had}} attempted to prevent the crossing had been reinforced by four additional companies from Corydon, one from Elizabeth, and one from New Amsterdam, making the force about four-hundred strong. They lured a company of unsuspecting Confederates into an ambush where they were surrounded; sixteen were captured and taken to the Corydon jail. The invaders also successfully captured about thirty defenders in several skirmishes. They were rounded up and held in a school house near Laconia. After Morgan crossed the river he addressed the prisoners <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> if they would promise {{to go home and}} not return to arms, he would allow them to leave and keep their guns. They all agreed and were released.|$|E

5|$|On May 9, 1921, {{striking}} of the Morgan dollar resumed at the Philadelphia Mint {{under the}} recoinage {{called for by}} the Pittman Act. The same day, Congressman Vestal introduced the Peace dollar authorization bill as a joint resolution. Vestal placed his bill on the Unanimous Consent Calendar, but Congress adjourned for a lengthy recess without taking any action. When Congress returned, Vestal asked for unanimous consent that the bill pass on August 1, 1921. However, one representative, former Republican leader James R. Mann (Illinois) objected, and numismatic historian Roger Burdette suggests that Mann's stature in the House ensured that the bill would not pass. Nevertheless, Vestal met with the ANA <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> he hoped Congress would reconsider when it met again in December 1921.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of the 9th, Crowe met with the {{committee}} <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> management refused their demands, was stopping all work, and was laying off the entire work force, except for a few office workers and carpenters. The workers were given until 5p.m. to vacate the premises. Concerned that a violent confrontation was imminent, most workers took their paychecks and left for Las Vegas to await developments. Two days later, the remainder were talked into leaving by law enforcement. On August 13, the company began hiring workers again, and two days later, the strike was called off. While the workers received none of their demands, the company guaranteed there would be no further reductions in wages. Living conditions began to improve as the first residents moved into Boulder City in late 1931.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the badnjak is {{explained}} by the events surrounding the Nativity of Jesus Christ. According to the Gospel of Luke , Mary Theotokos gave birth to Christ at Bethlehem, wrapped him in cloths and laid him in a manger. By Holy Tradition, the manger was located in a cave near that town. An angel of the Lord appeared {{to a group of}} shepherds who were keeping watch over their flock by night in that region, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> the Savior was born at Bethlehem. They went there and found the baby lying in the manger, as the angel described to them. By folk tradition, the shepherds brought firewood to the cave and built a fire to warm the newborn Christ and his mother throughout the night. The burning of the badnjak commemorates this event.|$|E
60|$|They met Miss Meadows {{at their}} own gate, <b>and</b> she <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> dear Lucy was very sorry, and she hoped they would take no more notice of a little {{nonsense}} that could do no one any harm; she would be more on her guard next time.|$|R
60|$|Then Sigwe <b>told</b> <b>them</b> of all {{the good}} fortune {{that had come to}} him through Suzanne, and of how wise had been the words of Sihamba, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them,</b> moreover, <b>that</b> if they dealt ill by either of them he would return from his own country and stamp them flat.|$|R
60|$|Felicity and Cecily and Sara Ray cried so {{much that}} Aunt Janet lost {{patience}} completely <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> sharply <b>that</b> they would have something to cry for some day--which {{did not seem to}} comfort them much.

5|$|Croatian Home Guards, Ustaše, and a German {{battalion}} from Banja Lukaabout 10,000 soldiersattacked the Partisan-held {{territory in}} Kozara on 18August 1941. The enemy troops {{broke through the}} Partisan front line and penetrated into the area. They burnt houses and looted cattle and grain in the villages. Some of the villagers became demoralised, and blamed the Partisans for their losses; some placed white flags on their houses. The Partisan units retreated deeper into forested areas in the mountains. Stojanović led the Kozara Detachment toward Lisina, the highest peak of Kozara. In the evening, he assembled his men <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> {{they were in the}} army of the KPJ and all peoples of Yugoslavia, so they could not allow themselves to be attached to any specific village or area. He advised those who could not detach themselves from their homes to lay down their weapons and leave. Several men left the detachment, which then moved toward Lisina where they organised a camp and spent some time in military training and political indoctrination. The attack of 18August was the first counter-insurgency operation in Kozara, and the Partisans emerged from it without significant losses.|$|E
5|$|Levy {{was last}} seen on May 1, 2001. The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia was first alerted on May 6, when Levy's parents called from Modesto to report {{that they had not}} heard from their {{daughter}} in five days. Police called hospitals and visited Levy's apartment in Dupont Circle that day, finding no indication of foul play. On May 7, Levy's father told the police that his daughter had been {{having an affair with a}} U.S. congressman, and said the next day that he believed the congressman to be U.S. Representative Gary Condit. Levy's aunt also called the police <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> Chandra had confided in her about the affair. Police obtained a warrant on May 10 to conduct a formal search of Levy's apartment. Investigators found her credit cards, identification and mobile phone left behind in her purse, along with partially packed suitcases. The answering machine was full, with messages left by her relatives and two from Condit. A police sergeant tried to examine Levy's laptop computer and inadvertently corrupted the internet search data, as he was not a trained technician.|$|E

25|$|Before {{embarking on}} their journey, Evans and Cheevers {{did not know}} each other.

In late 1657, Cheevers was 50 years old and Katherine was about 40 years old. Upon introduction in a London-based Quaker community, they decided to make their journeys together and quickly formed a devoted relationship.|$|E

25|$|On 5 December 1988 (16 {{days prior}} to the attack), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a {{security}} bulletin saying that, on that day, {{a man with an}} Arabic accent had telephoned the US Embassy in Helsinki, Finland, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> a Pan Am flight from Frankfurt to the United States would be blown up within the next two weeks by someone associated with the Abu Nidal Organization; he said a Finnish woman would carry the bomb on board as an unwitting courier.|$|E
25|$|The {{bodies of}} dead hostages {{were put in}} two buses which were parked at the TC. Initial reports said nothing about {{casualties}} among the hostages.
