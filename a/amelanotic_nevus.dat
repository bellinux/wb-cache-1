40|$|Background: Conjunctival myxoma {{is a type}} of rare, {{benign tumor}} of mesenchymal cells, with fewer than 30 {{reported}} cases in the English literature. It is mostly an isolated occurrence but can sometimes be associated with systemic diseases such as Carney complex or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. It is necessary in clinical practice to differentiate it from other similar lesions, such as <b>amelanotic</b> <b>nevus,</b> lymphangioma, myxoid liposarcoma, spindle-cell lipoma, myxoid neurofibroma, and rhabdomyosarcoma. Case Presentation: The usual presentation of conjunctival myxoma is a translucent, well-circumscribed, and painless conjunctival mass, but in this report we discuss an unusual case of conjunctival myxoma in a 47 -year-old Taiwanese woman who presented initially with pain and redness. This atypical presentation complicated the diagnosis and the management at first. Surgical excision of the mass was performed. The mass was found to be a conjunctival myxoma. The patient subsequently underwent extensive evaluation but was found not to have any systemic diseases with known association with conjunctival myxoma. Conclusions: In summary, we present a case of conjunctival myxoma in a 47 -year-old Taiwanese woman. The initial presentation with pain and redness was atypical for conjunctival myxoma. The lesion was successfully managed with complete excisional biopsy...|$|E

40|$|Apocrine hydrocystoma (AH) is a translucent, skin-colored to bluish dome shaped cyst on the face. AH mimics {{basal cell}} {{carcinoma}} (BCC), blue <b>nevus,</b> <b>amelanotic</b> melanoma requiring histopathological confirmation. Dermoscopy shows specific patterns in skin conditions. Dermoscopy of AH is not described in the literature. Authors evaluated dermoscopic patterns in AH and observed characteristic patterns corresponding to histological features. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, it is a first report in literature...|$|R
40|$|A clinicopathologic {{case of a}} 41 -year-old female patient {{exhibited}} a single cutaneous tumor at the inner part of the free margin of the inferior left eyelid. It was a pink, fleshy, and nodular well-circumscribed exophytic mass with thin vessels on its surface. Experienced already for 20 years, this lesion had been observed 6 years before and has not exhibited much change since then. However, its clinical appearance argued for a possible small basal cell carcinoma, which had grown over the inferior left lachrymal duct. After surgical removal, histopathology showed that the tumor was an <b>amelanotic</b> dermal <b>nevus.</b> No disturbance of lachrymal drainage was observed after surgery. This case shows that nodular amelanotic tumors of the eyelid, even when located on the inner segment of the eyelid, may be a nevus...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} the spectral-domain {{optical coherence tomography}} (SD-OCT) features of choroidal tumors imaged using enhanced depth imaging (EDI) technique. DESIGN: Prospective observational case series. METHODS: One tumor each from 23 eyes of 23 patients was included. All the patients underwent clinical fundus photography, ultrasonography, and EDI SD-OCT. Qualitative characteristics (tumor outline, reflectivity and/or shadowing of choroidal layers, and detection of inner sclera) and quantitative characteristics (measurement of maximum tumor thickness and the largest tumor diameter) were assessed. RESULTS: Patients (male = 12) were categorized as: <b>amelanotic</b> choroidal <b>nevus</b> (4), melanotic choroidal nevus (9), choroidal melanoma (3), circumscribed choroidal hemangioma (3), and choroidal metastasis (4). in all cases, EDI SD-OCT was {{able to identify the}} tumor distinctly from the surrounding normal choroid. Qualitative analysis revealed: amelanotic nevi, homogenous and medium reflective band with visible choroidal vessels; melanotic nevi and choroidal melanomas, high reflective band in the anterior choroid with shadowing, and nonvisualization of choroidal vessels and inner sclera; choroidal hemangiomas, medium/low reflective band without shadowing; and choroidal metastasis, low reflective band in the deep choroid with enlargement of the suprachoroidal space. Maximum tumor diameter and thickness was measurable by EDT SD-OCT only in 10 cases that were < 9. 0 mm in diameter and < 1. 0 mm in thickness (undetectable by ultrasonography). CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to obtain cross-sectional views of a variety of choroidal tumors using EDT SD-OCT. Small choroidal tumors nondetectable by ultrasonography can be objectively measured by this technique. (Am J Ophthalmol 2011; 151 : 586 - 593. (C) 2011 by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.)
