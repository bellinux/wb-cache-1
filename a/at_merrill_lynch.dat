The bank also disclosed it tried to abandon the deal in December after the extent of Merrill's trading losses surfaced, but was compelled to complete the merger by the U.S. government.

5000|$|Reactions to Holder's {{announcement}} about Operation Broken Trust were {{framed by}} the apparent lack of governmental efforts of prosecuting individuals who may bear responsibility for the 2008 financial crisis, specifically since nobody <b>at</b> Lehman, <b>Merrill</b> <b>Lynch,</b> Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs (other than Fabrice Tourre) has been charged criminally. [...] Thus it was criticized as allocating resources to the wrong arena, described as a [...] "sideshow", and going for the [...] "little fish".

[...] In addition to the technological side of it, the affected functionality emanates from the perceived unfairness and the reduced trust of people towards the state.
