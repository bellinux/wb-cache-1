Contracts based on competitive bids for the first five routes were awarded in October 1925, with operators originally to be compensated [...] "at a rate not to exceed four-fifths of the revenue derived from the Air Mail." [...] (This was changed on July 1, 1926, to a rate based on the total weight of the mails carried on each flight.)
