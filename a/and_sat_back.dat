25|$|The {{event was}} held under a one-night tournament format. In the first round, Shamrock was pitted against taekwondo stylist Patrick Smith, who he made short work of by {{throwing}} Smith {{to the mat}} and submitting him with a heel hook. His next opponent would be Brazilian jiu-jitsu exponent and eventual tournament winner Royce Gracie. Shamrock sprawled a takedown attempt and maneuvered on top of Gracie, and then grabbed his ankle <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> to attempt another heel hook. According to Shamrock, however, his arm had gotten tangled in Gracie's gi, and when Shamrock sat back, it pulled Gracie on top of him, which allowed Gracie to secure a choke and submit Shamrock. While the move is often listed as a rear naked choke, Shamrock later stated it to be actually a gi choke, in which Royce would have wrapped the cloth of his gi around Ken's neck. The ending of the fight was also source of controversy because the referee {{did not see the}} tap and ordered the two fighters to continue fighting after Gracie had let go of the hold. Shamrock paused for a few seconds but declined, admitting to the ref that he tapped out and {{that it would not be}} fair for him to continue fighting.|$|E
500|$|During {{the game}} of the seventh round between Nigel Short and Li Chao, the former was {{returning}} from the toilet with about 30 minutes to make 20 moves when an anti-cheating arbiter asked him to undergo a spot check with a hand scanner for electronic devices. Short did not heed the request, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> down to play. After the game, Klaus Deventer (the head of the anti-cheating arbiters) reprimanded Short with a warning. Short discussed the incident extensively after the event, indicating {{that he did not}} think the cost of annoyance to the player (even when returning from outside the playing area) was comparable to the anti-cheating benefit, though he was not pressed specifically regarding cases where a culprit had in fact been disqualified following mid-game requests for inspection (some for refusal, others for being caught with a device). Initially Short also mentioned the fact that he and the arbiter in question (Jamie Kenmure, an Australian who is FIDE delegate for the Solomon Islands) have a political past, and thus Short did not trust that his being selected for the test actually originated from Deventer (as per the regulations). Alternative initial reports dramatised the event to have the arbiters [...] "ask him to step away from the board and subject himself to a full search" [...] while in time trouble and playing a [...] "do-or-die" [...] position, though these details now seem discredited.|$|E
60|$|The screen glowed into life. Reinhart {{punched the}} {{combination}} keys <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> to wait.|$|E
60|$|The {{time came}} when speech failed James Boyd, <b>and</b> he <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in his chair, brooding. Elizabeth, cross <b>and</b> wounded, <b>sat</b> in hers, nursing Joseph. And so, in a dim light, time flowed by.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] grumbled Sir Terence, <b>and</b> he <b>sat</b> <b>back,</b> foiled for {{the moment}} in his {{deliberate}} intent to torture her into admissions that must betray her if made.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{perhaps you}} can't. But I understand"; <b>and</b> she <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in her chair, her chin in one hand, holding her elbow with the other, brimmed up with wrath and chagrin.|$|R
6000|$|The pearl-buyer {{pulled the}} pegs {{out of the}} cribbage board on which he was scoring <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back.</b> He had won the third game. He glanced across to Eddy Little, saying: ...|$|E
60|$|He waved {{away the}} attendants, drank a deep draught from the cup at his elbow, wiped {{his mouth with}} the back of his hand, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in his tall chair to hear her.|$|E
60|$|She {{drew her}} hand away, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in her corner. The man's hot breath fell upon her cheek, his eyes seemed almost {{phosphorescent}} in the darkness. Lucille could scarcely keep the biting words from her tongue.|$|E
60|$|Rivera's way was different. Indian blood, {{as well as}} Spanish, was in his veins, <b>and</b> he <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in a corner, silent, immobile, {{only his}} black eyes passing from face to face and noting everything.|$|R
60|$|He {{lifted his}} head once more, {{suddenly}} clasped her hand, his eyes came to consciousness, his hand relaxed, he recognized her, <b>and</b> he <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in his chair, turning his face aside and lowering his lashes.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, {{travelers}} of the horse-and-buggy era used an unscheduled ferry to cross from Fidalgo Island to Whidbey Island. To call the ferry, they banged a saw with a mallet <b>and</b> then <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> to wait.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tomorrow, see, {{you will}} be well. Quite certain!" [...] said Louis. Madame mournfully shook her head, opened her mouth, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> with closed eyes and the stump of the {{thermometer}} comically protruding from a corner of her lips. Meanwhile Alvina took her plump white wrist and felt her pulse.|$|E
60|$|Gaston de Stainville {{sat on a}} tabouret at {{a respectful}} distance. He had in his hand a letter with a seal {{attached}} to it and a map, which {{had a number of}} notes scribbled in the margin. His Majesty seemed in a superlatively good humour, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in his chair, his fat body shaking now and again with bursts of merriment.|$|E
60|$|A strong {{smell of}} tobacco {{showed that the}} {{diagnosis}} had been a true one. Each of the figures in turn lit his pipe at the candle, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back,</b> still in silence. It {{could not have been}} very pleasant, smoking in almost pitch darkness, but it was breaking rules, which was probably the main consideration that swayed the smokers. They puffed away steadily, till the two Irishmen were wrapped about in invisible clouds.|$|E
60|$|After {{saying this}} {{he lowered his}} eyes, signed rapidly two single sheets of paper, and only then laid down his pen, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> well <b>back,</b> {{directing}} an inquiring gaze at his renowned subordinate. The Chief Inspector stood it well, deferential but inscrutable.|$|R
60|$|He, too, {{expressed}} surprise, <b>and</b> Sir Thomas <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in a hush of reprobation {{that seemed}} to have the chill of the centuries behind it. The Empire's work was resumed.|$|R
6000|$|I {{raised my}} hand. Mr. Marx whispered, [...] "Now!" [...] And the bouquet was lying at her feet. She {{picked it up}} gracefully, shot a coquettish glance up towards me, and then the curtain fell, <b>and</b> I <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in my chair, feeling quite {{convinced}} that I had made an utter fool of myself.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed that}} the habit of shuddering {{at the thought of}} pie ran in the McCall family, for at the mention of the word a kind of {{internal}} shimmy had convulsed Washington's lean frame, and over his face there had come an expression that was almost one of pain. He had been reaching out his hand for a slice of Health Bread, but now he withdrew it rather hurriedly <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> breathing hard.|$|E
60|$|But my {{thoughts}} wandered from the doings {{of the son}} of Iapetus, until at last I flung down the book <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in my chair all lost in thought, in doubt, and in conjecture. I became seriously introspective. I made an examination not only of conscience, but of heart and mind, and I found that I had gone woefully astray from the path that had been prepared for me. Very late I sat there and sought to determine upon what I should do.|$|E
60|$|Andre-Louis, however, still went {{on eating}} stolidly, {{without so much}} as a look in her direction. Gradually the company came to realize that just as surely as a scene was brooding, just so surely would there be no scene as long as they {{remained}}. It was Polichinelle, at last, who gave the signal by rising and withdrawing, and within two minutes none remained in the room but M. Binet, his daughter, and Andre-Louis. And then, at last, Andre-Louis set down knife and fork, washed his throat with a draught of Burgundy, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in his chair to consider Climene.|$|E
60|$|She {{was wearing}} a maize-coloured muslin to which the {{sunlight}} gave a sort of transparency, <b>and</b> <b>sat,</b> leaning <b>back,</b> her knees crossed, one hand resting on the knob of her furled sunshade, her face half hidden by her shady hat. Summerhay clenched his teeth, and went straight up to her.|$|R
60|$|The guest seemed {{helpless}} {{to take his}} gaze from it, <b>and</b> he <b>sat</b> fallen <b>back</b> in his chair at it when the woman {{came in with a}} pie.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> I <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> marvelled {{secretly}} at this encyclopaedic-minded man, this Leith Clay-Randolph, {{this common}} tramp who made himself {{at home in}} my den, charmed such friends as gathered at my small table, outshone me with his brilliance and his manners, spent my spending money, smoked my best cigars, and selected from my ties and studs with a cultivated and discriminating eye.|$|R
60|$|But now at last {{since the}} very blood in his body had in vain rebelled against his Titanic soul; now the only visible outward symbols of that soul--his eyes--did also turn downright traitors to him, and with more success than the rebellious blood. He had abused them so recklessly, that now they {{absolutely}} refused to look on paper. He turned them on paper, and they blinked and shut. The pupils of his eyes rolled away from him in their own orbits. He put his hand up to them, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in his seat. Then, without saying one word, he continued there for his usual term, suspended, motionless, blank.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned to}} the stage, and Tristan was wounded in Kurvenal's arms, with Isolde at his feet, and King Mark, the {{incarnation}} of masculine force and obligation, the masculine creditor of love and beauty, stood over him, and the second climax was ending in wreaths and reek of melodies; and then the curtain was coming down {{in a series of}} short rushes, the music had ended, and the people were stirring and breaking out into applause, and the lights of the auditorium were resuming. The lighting-up pierced the obscurity of the box, and Ramage stopped his urgent flow of words abruptly <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back.</b> This helped to restore Ann Veronica's self-command.|$|E
60|$|The Colonel {{pulled his}} goatee, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in his chair, trying {{to face the}} new light in which he saw his manager. He knew well enough {{that the man was}} not doing this out of charity, or even gratitude. He {{reviewed}} his whole career, from that first morning when he had carried bales to the shipping room, to his replacement of Mr. Hood, and there was nothing with which to accuse him. He remembered the warnings of Captain Lige and Virginia. He could not in honor ask a cent from the Captain now. He would not ask his sister-in-law, Mrs. Colfax, to let him touch the money he had so ably invested for her; that little which Virginia's mother had left the girl was sacred.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't take you!" [...] {{he almost}} groaned. [...] "It's madness! It's impossible!" [...] And {{he went out}} into the passage. He ran down the steps and got into his cab. An immense time seemed to pass before it began to move. It started at last, <b>and</b> Hilary <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in it, his hands clenched, still as a dead man.|$|R
6000|$|... "While {{they was}} talking who should come along but George English hisself! He came {{right up to}} the table, <b>and</b> they all <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> on the bench and stared at ’im fierce, and Henery Walker crinkled ’is nose at him.|$|R
50|$|Grave Digger #1 - Original truck. The {{truck was}} taken apart <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> in the <b>back</b> of Diggers Dungeon. It made an {{appearance}} at World Finals 8 (2007). It now sits {{around the front}} of Diggers Dungeon.|$|R
60|$|He {{broke off}} on this sort of threat {{addressed}} to the western world. Disregarding the anger in his stare, I pointed out that whether the journalist was well- or ill-informed, the concern of the friends of these ladies was with the effect the few lines of print in question had produced--the effect alone. And surely he must be counted {{as one of the}} friends--if only {{for the sake of his}} late comrade and intimate fellow-revolutionist. At that point I thought he was going to speak vehemently; but he only astounded me by the convulsive start of his whole body. He restrained himself, folded his loosened arms tighter across his chest, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> with a smile in which there was a twitch of scorn and malice.|$|E
6000|$|After {{dinner that}} evening Lady Surrey sent Gladys off to Miss Martindale's room on some small pretext, {{and then put}} Harry {{down on the sofa}} beside her to help in {{arranging}} those interminable ferns of hers. Evening dress suited the countess best, and she knew it. She was looking even more beautiful than before, with her hair prettily dressed, and the little simple turquoise necklet setting off her white neck; and she talked a great deal to Harry, and was really very charming. No more fascinating widow, he thought, to be found anywhere within a hundred miles. At last she stopped, leaning over the ferns, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> a little on the sofa, half fronting him. [...] "Mr. Vardon," [...] she said suddenly, [...] "there is something I wish to speak to you about, privately." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{turned the}} woolly leaves over very slowly. He frowned impatiently, {{and from the}} end {{backwards}} turned them over again. Then he laid the book softly {{down on the table}} <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back.</b> He stared with narrowed lids into the flame of his quiet friendly candle. Every trace, every shred of portrait and memoir were gone. Once more, deliberately, punctiliously, he examined page by page the blurred and unfamiliar French--the sooty heads, the long, lean noses, the baggy eyes passing like figures in a peepshow one by one under his hand--to the last fragmentary and dexterously mended leaf. Yes, Sabathier was gone. Quite the old slow Lawford smile crept over his face at the discovery. It was a smile a little sheepish too, as he thought of Sheila's quiet vigilance.|$|E
6000|$|... "On {{the matter}} of your errand," [...] the Irishman {{returned}} quietly, [...] "I am much better informed than are you. Shall I tell you who lives at {{the sign of the}} Anchor--not whom you have been told lives there, but who really does occupy the house?" [...] Hogan paused a second as though awaiting some reply; then softly he answered his own question: [...] "Colonel Pride." [...] <b>And</b> he <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> to await results.|$|R
60|$|Their master {{threw the}} other leg over the coping <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> motionless. His <b>back</b> was turned toward the men as he sat with head bent, looking down the shaft. He sat {{for so long that}} George became uneasy.|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} Harris threw away the sculls, {{got up and}} left his seat, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> on his <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> stuck his legs in the air. Montmorency howled, and turned a somersault, and the top hamper jumped up, and all the things came out.|$|R
