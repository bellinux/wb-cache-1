40|$|Biological organisms must perform {{computation}} as they grow, reproduce, and evolve. Moreover, {{ever since}} Landauer's bound was proposed {{it has been}} known that all computation has some thermodynamic cost [...] and that the same computation can be achieved with greater or smaller thermodynamic cost depending on how it is implemented. Accordingly an important issue concerning the evolution of life is assessing the thermodynamic efficiency of the computations performed by organisms. This issue is interesting both {{from the perspective of}} how close life has come to maximally efficient computation (presumably under the pressure of natural selection), and from the practical perspective of what efficiencies we might hope that engineered biological computers might achieve, especially in comparison with current computational systems. Here we show that the computational efficiency of translation, defined as free energy expended per amino <b>acid</b> <b>operation,</b> outperforms the best supercomputers by several orders of magnitude, and is only about an order of magnitude worse than the Landauer bound. However this efficiency depends strongly on the size and architecture of the cell in question. In particular, we show that the useful efficiency of an amino <b>acid</b> <b>operation,</b> defined as the bulk energy per amino acid polymerization, decreases for increasing bacterial size and converges to the polymerization cost of the ribosome. This cost of the largest bacteria does not change in cells as we progress through the major evolutionary shifts to both single and multicellular eukaryotes. However, the rates of total computation per unit mass are nonmonotonic in bacteria with increasing cell size, and also change across different biological architectures including the shift from unicellular to multicellular eukaryotes.

40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{evaluated}} synthetic fluorspar as {{a substitute}} for natural fluorspar flux in basic cupola ironmaking. The synthetic fluor-spars tested were prepared from waste fluosilicic acid generated during the processing of fluorapatite ore. The cupola trials showed the synthetic products to be the equivalent of natural fluorspar from an operational standpoint. However, wet scrubber sampling showed that substantial losses of volatilized fluorine occurred from the cupola during operation. The losses during synthetic fluorspar trials considerably exceeded those from natural fluorspar trials. Laboratory viscosity testing, using a high-temperature rotational viscometer, confirmed this finding and indicated that fluorspar volatility in slags is related to slag basicity. Synthetic fluorspar is accordingly recommended more for highly basic cupola operation (> 1. 3 basicity) than for neutral or <b>acid</b> <b>operation,</b> because of the increased potential for pollution and baghouse filter detezioration...|$|E
30|$|Membrane {{cleaning}} using a {{high concentration}} of salt solution was carried out following the baseline study (first trial). The operating conditions were the same as those used in the baseline study, and the schematic diagram of the system used in its final form is shown in Fig.  2. During this study, offline salt cleaning was carried out using a salt solution with a concentration > 20  %. However, it was observed that the conditions set for the faster fouling did not actually accelerate fouling, i.e., even after waiting for 1  month no significant decline in performance was observed that warrant a cleaning. The membranes are to be fouled fast so as to perform a sufficient number of cleanings in a limited period to confirm the findings, hence the need for accelerated fouling of the membrane. However, a further increase in flux was not possible due to feed pressure limits of the membrane. As a result, it was decided to gradually increase the pH of the feed seawater to achieve faster fouling/scaling of the membrane. Thus, feed pH to the membrane increased gradually from 7.0 to 8 (no <b>acid</b> <b>operation).</b> Consequently, a total of three membrane cleanings were conducted using super saline solution as there was a slight decline of < 10  % in the normalized flow. Although during salt cleaning significant amount of foulants was removed from the membrane surface (as evident from the strong discoloration of the cleaning solution exiting from brine side), no noticeable recovery of the lost membrane performance was achieved (Fig.  4). These foulants could have been loosely bound to the membrane surface, and thus easily removed by the forward flushing action of cleaning solution due to feed cross-flow velocity, which is quite normal. However, the osmotic backwash action seemed to have little impact on removing foulant from membrane surfaces. Thus, the results indicate that the offline salt cleaning, even with a very {{high concentration of}} salt solution, did not help the recovery of membrane performance. This result is quite different from that obtained when salt was used to clean artificially fouled RO membranes in a bench-scale test unit, where it was effective in restoring membrane performance (Lee and Elimelech 2007). The nature of the foulant as well as membrane configuration and microstructure might {{have played a role in}} rendering the salt cleaning ineffective in the present study. Once sufficient data were collected, the membranes were removed and subjected to autopsy analyses.|$|E

Since these mixtures contain rather strong oxidizers and a fuel, they have the potential of being highly sensitive liquid explosives. Studies showed such mixtures are not exceptionally sensitive to mechanical impact and friction or thermal initiation. However, these mixtures at oxygen balanced proportions are extremely sensitive to induced shock and are capable of propagating explosive reactions at film thicknesses less than 0. 5 mm. In the standard NOL card gap cest, oxygen balanced mixtures of N 1 O 2 with nitrobody exhibited an attenuator thickness of greater than 155 cm as compared to 3. 8 cm for TNT.

40|$|Abstract. Mud {{acid attack}} of 14 lbm/gal Portland cement {{composites}} with 15 % of nonionic aqueous polyurethane was investigated. Plain Portland hardened cement slurries showed {{the loss of}} weight around 23 %. The addition of aqueous polyurethane resulted in longer durability, with reduction around 87 % on the loss of weight without influence on the compressive strength or fratographic. The mechanism is related with the decreased porosity and permeability due to the polymeric net formation on the bulk and minor quantities of Ca + 2, preferentially leached to the acidic solution. In this way, Portland-aqueous polyurethane composites are possible solutions to oil well cementing submitted to steam injection and mud <b>acid</b> acidizing <b>operations...</b>|$|R
