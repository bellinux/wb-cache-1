Panel Data Probit analysis revealed that likelihood of a household to be a tenant is positively linked with number of agricultural worker, bullock ownership and male-headed household. Land ownership, age and education of household head, and dependence on non-farm income had negative association. Crop yield and profitability were generally higher in owned land than that of land under tenancy. Reduction of reverse tenancy in dryland agriculture will require risk reducing technologies (drought-resistant varieties, supplementary irrigation) and availability of critical inputs (for example, bullock for intercultural operations) ...|$|E
40|$|The study {{reconfirmed}} {{prevalence of}} reverse tenancy in dryland agriculture in Southern India {{in recent years}} (2009 - 10 and 2011 - 12) as was in the mid-seventies. Household level panel data collected from six villages by ICRISAT under its Village Level Studies (VLS) and Village Dynamics Studies (VDS) programme were analysed. <b>Area</b> <b>under</b> <b>tenancy</b> has increased in recent years, mostly {{in the form of}} sharecropping. Panel Data Probit analysis revealed that likelihood of a household to be a tenant is positively linked with bullock ownership and large farm size while age and education of the household head, and dependence on non-farm income had a negative association. Determinants of extent of tenancy (rented in area) were measured through Panel Data Feasible Generalised Least Square (FGLS) regression analysis. Results indicated that an additional bullock increased rented-in area by 0. 22 ha. On the other hand, large farmers had 0. 47 ha more area under rented-in compared to other tenants. There was negative relationship between rented-in area and age and education of the household head indicating that educated and elderly people participated less in the tenancy market. Input use level, crop yield and profitability were generally higher in own land than that of rented-in land in the mid-seventies. In recent years, we observed mixed (inconclusive) outcome for input use, crop yield and profitability. Reduction of production risks in one of the study villages has not only reduced tenancy but also abolished reverse tenancy...|$|E

This paper investigates the e¤ects of tenancy rent control on housing quality, maintenance, and rehabilitation.

Thirty cash tenants and 30 share tenants were randomly selected for data collection through field survey method from Narayanpur and Bhabokhali villages under Sadar upazila of Mymensingh district. The functional analysis {{of the study was}} based on Boro rice. The land tenancy situation in rural Bangladesh was explored in this study with a reasonable high incidence of owners who cultivate their own land in comparison to owner-cum-tenants and tenants. A number of tenurial arrangements including sharing agreements were also revealed in the study villages. Share tenant farmers earned significantly lower net return (Tk. 19, 252. 18) than the cash tenant farmers (Tk. 22, 815. 89) from Boro rice production. However, Boro rice production was profitable from the viewpoint of both tenant operators. Finally, the study tested and confirmed that all the explanatory variables (key production inputs) included in the Cobb-Douglas revenue type production function model were important for explaining the variations in gross returns <b>under</b> both <b>tenancy</b> arrangements...|$|R

Nearly half of its farm land was <b>under</b> <b>tenancy</b> and some tenants paid to landlords as much as 70 percent of their annual crop as rent and had no security of tenure. Their income was extremely low and their life difficult. The land reform program was carried out in three phases. The first phase was carried out in 1949. The program compulsorily re-duced farm rental rates in Taiwan from an average of 50 percent to a uniform rate of 37. 5 percent of the annual crop yield. Many tenant families were benefited. The second phase began in 1952. By the end of 1961, 94, 000 hectares of public owned land had been sold b...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE — To {{develop a}} {{mathematical}} model for the determination of total <b>areas</b> <b>under</b> curves from various metabolic studies. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — In Tai's Model, the total <b>area</b> <b>under</b> a curve is computed by dividing the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> the curve between two designated values on the X-axis (abscissas) into small segments (rectangles and triangles) whose areas can be accurately calculated from their respective geometrical formulas. The total sum of these individual areas thus represents the total <b>area</b> <b>under</b> the curve. Validity of the model is established by comparing total areas obtained from this model to these same areas obtained from graphic method Gess than ± 0. 4 %). Other formulas widely applied by researchers under- or overestimated total <b>area</b> <b>under</b> a metabolic curve by a great margin. RESULTS — Tai's model proves {{to be able to}} 1) determine total <b>area</b> <b>under</b> a curve with precision; 2) calculate area with varied shapes {{that may or may not}} intercept on one or both X/Y axes; 3) estimate total <b>area</b> <b>under</b> a curve plotted against varied time intervals (abscissas), whereas other formulas only allow the same time interval; an...|$|R
