5000|$|The Sumozero-Kenozero greenstone belt in {{the southeastern}} section of the Baltic shield is ~400 km long and up to 50 km wide. It {{comprises}} a 5-km thick oceanic plateau sequence of submarine komatiite-basalt lava and volcanic sediments. The belt is intruded and overlain by an island arc-like sequence of intermediate-felsic volcanic rocks including andesitic basalts, andesites, dacites and rhyolites. According {{to a study by}} Puchtel et al. (1999): [...] "The komatiites were derived from a liquid containing ~30% MgO. This liquid was initiated at depths of 300-400 km in a mantle plume that was some 250°C hotter than the ambient mantle. Both komatiites and basalts of the lower sequence are strongly depleted in LREE, have high εNd(T) of +2.7±0.3, relatively unradiogenic Pb isotope compositions (µ m1 = 8.7±0.2) and show Nb-maxima (Nb/Nb* = 1.2±0.2, Nb/U = 43±6)." [...] These parameters are found {{in a number of other}} early Precambrian greenstones and in recent Pacific OFB. [...] "They are regarded as plume source characteristics and provide further evidence for the existence of certain Nb-excess in the <b>Archaean</b> <b>mantle</b> due to the early extraction of large volumes of continental crust with low Nb/U ratios. The intermediate-felsic volcanic and subvolcanic rocks of the upper unit are enriched in LREE, depleted in HFSE, but have positive εNd(T) values of +2.5±1.2. They represent both mantle wedge-derived basalt-andesite-dacite-rhyolite (BADR), and slab-derived (adakite) melts, erupted in the inner and frontal parts of an intraoceanic island arc." [...] U-Pb zircon ages for the felsic volcanic rocks are 2875±2 Ma, and Pb-Pb and Sm-Nd ages of 2892±130 and 2916±117 Ma for the komatiites-basalts.|$|E

Consequently, understanding the petrogenesis of these rocks provides valuable insights into early Earth processes. Fluid-absent slab melting represents the dominant hypothesis for {{the origin of}} these rocks; however, the absence of voluminous magmas of intermediate composition formed concurrently with these TTGs is incompatible with expectations of slab water loss prior to slab melting. This study demonstrates that for reasonable <b>Archaean</b> <b>mantle</b> temperatures, slab-derived water is captured by an anatectic zone near the slab surface, which melts via reactions that consume quartz, clinopyroxene and water to produce high-Al 2 O 3 Archaean trondhjemite. Late in the Archaean, the mantle cooled sufficiently to prevent wet melting of the slab, allowing slab water to migrate into the wedge and produce intermediate composition magmatism, which has since been associated with subduction zones...|$|E
40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} to describe the cooling of the Earth in the Archaean. At the higher <b>Archaean</b> <b>mantle</b> temperatures pressure-release melting starts deeper and generates a thicker basaltic or komatiitic rust and depleted harzburgite layer compared with the present-day situation. Intrinsic compositional stability and lack of mechanical coherency renders the mechanism of plate tectonics ineffective. It is proposed that the Archaean continents stabilised early {{on top of a}} compositionally stratified root. In the Archaean oceanic lithosphere, hydrated upper crust can founder and recycle through its high-pressure phase eclogite. Eclogite remelting and new pressure-release melting generates new crustal material. Migration of magma nd latent heat release by solidification at the surface provides an efficient mechanism to cool the mantle by several hundreds of degrees during the Archaean. This can satisfactorily explain the occurrence of high extrusion temperature komatiites and lower extrusion temperature basalts in greenstone belts as being derived from the same source by different mechanisms. 1...|$|E

But this interpretation has been questioned because of the possibility that subsequent perturbations may have re-equilibrated the neodymium-isotope compositions of these rocks(8). Independent and more robust evidence for the origin of the earliest crust and depletion of the <b>Archaean</b> <b>mantle</b> can potentially be provided by hafnium-isotope compositions of zircon, a mineral whose age can be precisely determined by U-Pb dating, and which can survive metamorphisms(4). But the amounts of hafnium in single zircon grains are too small for the isotopic composition to be precisely analysed by conventional methods. Here we report hafnium-isotope data, obtained using the new technique of multiple-collector plasma-source mass spectrometry(9), for 37 individual grains of the oldest known terrestrial zircons (from the Narryer Gneiss Complex, Australia, with U-Pb ages of up to 4. 14 Gyr (refs 10 - 13)). We find that none of the grains has a depleted mantle signature, but that many were derived from a source with a hafnium-isotope composition similar to that of chondritic meteorites. Furthermore, {{more than half of the}} analysed grains seem to have formed by remelting of significantly older crust, indicating that crustal preservation and subsequent reworking might have been important processes from earliest times...|$|E

The studies have aimed at testing correlations of lithologic units in partly poorly exposed areas, determining times of ore formation and obtaining ore genetic information {{in order to better}} understand the general evolution of the Archaean formations within the Fennoscandian Shield. Isotopic results on 63 zircon and titanite fractions from 13 samples, common lead analyses of 14 sulphide separates from two mineral prospects and 33 whole rock Pb-Pb analyses warrant the following conclusions: 1) Although some dates in excess of 3 Ga have been determined from the Finnish Archaean, most of the granite gneiss terrain was formed between 2. 85 and 2. 65 Ga with a major period of rock formation from about 2. 75 to 2. 69 Ga. 2) The majority of the metavolcanic rocks within the Kuhmo-Suomussalmi greenstone belt are 2. 79 Ga old, but the meta-andesites of the Luoma Group are distinctly older at 2. 97 Ga. 3) The Taivaljärvi Ag-Zn-Pb deposit appears to be syngenetic with the local metavolcanic rocks and is thus 2. 79 Ga old. Its lead probably represents the initial lead of both mafic and felsic metavolcanic rocks in the area. 4) When compared to the Abitibi region in Canada, the available Pb-Pb data may suggest a heterogeneous <b>Archaean</b> <b>mantle,</b> but as even this study shows, common lead data is inconclusive evidence, as it may be easily influenced by later hydrothermal processes...|$|E
40|$|New {{rare earth}} element (REE) data for Archaean basalts and spinifex-textured peridotites (STP) show a range of La/Sm ratios (chondrite-normalized) from 0. 36 to 3. 5, with {{the bulk of the}} data in the range 0. 7 – 1. 3. This {{supports}} the hypothesis, based on Sr isotope initial ratios, that the <b>Archaean</b> <b>mantle</b> was chemically heterogeneous. We suggest that the bulk mantle source for Archaean basaltic magmas was close to an undepleted earth material. An average chemical composition of the <b>Archaean</b> <b>mantle</b> is estimated using chemical regularities observed in Archaean STP and high-magnesian basalts. TiO 2 and MgO data show an inverse correlation which intersects the MgO axis at about 50 % MgO (Fo 92). TiO 2 abundance in the mantle source is measured on this plot by assigning anMgO= 38 % for the mantle. Concentrations of other elements are also estimated and these data are then used to obtain a composition for the bulk earth. We suggest an earth model with about 1. 35 times ordinary chondrite abundances of refractory lithophile elements and about 0. 2 times carbonaceous type 1 chondrite abundances of moderately volatile elements (such as Na, Rb, K, Mn). P shows severe depletion in the model earth relative to carbonaceous chondrites, a feature either due to volatilization or core formation (preferred). Our data support the hypothesis of Ringwood that the source material for the earth is a carbonaceous chondrite-like material. The generation of mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) is examined {{in the light of the}} model earth composition and Al 2 O 3 /TiO 2, CaO/TiO 2 ratios. It is suggested that for primitive basalts, these values can be used to predict the residual phases in their source. Comparison of chemical characteristics of inferred sources for 2. 7 -b. y. Archaean basalts and modern “normal” MORB indicates that the MORB source is severely depleted in highly incompatible elements such as Cs, Ba, Rb, U, Th, K, La and Nb, but has comparable abundances of less incompatible elements such as Ti, Zr, Y, Yb. The cause of the depletion in the MORB source is examined in terms of crust formation and extraction of silica-undersaturated melts. The latter seems to be a more likely explanation, since the degree of enrichment of highly incompatible elements in the crust only accounts for up to 40 % of their abundances in the bulk earth and cannot match the depletion pattern in normal MORB. A large volume of material, less depleted than the source for normal MORB must therefore exist in the mantle and can serve as the source for the ocean island basalts and “normal” MORB. Three different mantle evolution models are examined and each suggests that the mantle is stratified with respect to abundances of incompatible trace elements. We suggest that no satisfactory model is available to fully explain the spectrum of geochemical and geophysical data. In particular the Pb and Sr isotope data on oceanic basalts, the depletion patterns of MORB and the balance between lithophile abundances in the crust and mantle, are important geochemical constraints to mantle models. Further modelling of the mantle evolution will be dependent on firmer information on the role of subduction, mantle convection pattern, and basalt production through geologic time together with a better understanding of the nature of Archaean crustal genesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{recently}} discovered high, plume-like 3 He/ 4 He ratios at Rungwe Volcanic Province (RVP) in southern Tanzania, {{similar to those}} at the Main Ethiopian Rift in Ethiopia, strongly suggest that magmatism associated with continental rifting along the entire East African Rift System (EARS) has a deep mantle contribution (Hilton et al., 2011). New trace element and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic data for high 3 He/ 4 He lavas and tephras from RVP {{can be explained by}} binary mixing relationships involving Early Proterozoic (+/- <b>Archaean)</b> lithospheric <b>mantle,</b> present beneath the southern EARS, and a volatile-rich carbonatitic plume with a limited range of compositions and best represented by recent Nyiragongo lavas from the Virunga Volcanic Province also in the Western Rift. Other lavas from the Western Rift and from the southern Kenya Rift can also be explained through mixing between the same endmember components. In contrast, lavas from the northern Kenya and Main Ethiopian rifts can be explained through variable mixing between the same mantle plume material and the Middle to Late Proterozoic lithospheric mantle, present beneath the northern EARS. Thus, we propose that the bulk of EARS magmatism is sourced from mixing among three endmember sources: Early Proterozoic (+/- <b>Archaean)</b> lithospheric <b>mantle,</b> Middle to Late Proterozoic lithospheric mantle and a volatile-rich carbonatitic plume with a limited range of compositions. We propose further that the African Superplume, a large, seismically anomalous feature originating in the lower mantle beneath southern Africa, influences magmatism throughout eastern Africa with magmatism at RVP and Main Ethiopian Rift representing two different heads of a single mantle plume source. This is consistent with a single mantle plume origin of the coupled He-Ne isotopic signatures of mantle-derived xenoliths and/or lavas from all segments of the EARS (Halldorsson et al., 2014) ...|$|R

Jayachamarajapura (J. C.

In spite of deformation, metamorphism and alterations the komatiites still preserve many of the primary cooling structures, which stand testimony for their extrusive volcanic nature. Distinct features like pillows, flow-top polyhedral joints, ocelli, vesicular, flow-top breccia and cumulate segregations and crude layering are observed. However, massive, undifferentiated nature of komatiitic flows is more predominant. Because of serpentinisation, carbonitization and chloritization, the original mineralogy and textures are obliterated and scantily preserved. Still, these observed features provide vital clues to imply the formation of komatiite sequences in a submarine to subaerial conditions when episodic pulses of komatiite lava piled up (about 3. 35 Ga ago) to form the ultramafic milieu of J.

40|$|Orogenic peridotites occur {{enclosed}} in Proterozoic gneisses at several localities in the Western Gneiss Region (WGR) of western Norway; garnet peridotites typically occur as discrete zones within larger bodies of garnet-free, chromite-bearing dunite and are commonly {{closely associated with}} pyroxenites and eclogites. The dunites of the large Almklovdalen peridotite body have extremely depleted compositions (Mg-number 92 – 93. 6); the garnet peridotites have lower Mg-number (90. 6 – 91. 7) and higher whole-rock Ca and Al contents. Post-depletion metasomatism of both rock types is indicated by variable enrichment in the light rare earth elements, Th, Ba and Sr. The dunites can be modelled as residues after very high degrees (> 60 %) of melt extraction at high pressure (5 – 7 GPa), inconsistent with the preservation of lower degrees of melting in the garnet peridotites. The garnet peridotites are, therefore, interpreted as zones of melt percolation, which resulted in refertilization of the dunites by a silicate melt rich in Fe, Ca, Al and Na, but not Ti. Previous Re–Os dating gives Archaean model ages for the dunites, but mixed Archaean and Proterozoic ages for the garnet peridotites, suggesting that refertilization occurred in Proterozoic time.

Recovering this information has fundamental implications in constraining the thermal state of the mantle and the physics of mantle convection throughout the Earth's history. Here a statistical approach is applied to a geochemical database of about 22, 000 samples from the mafic magma record. Potential temperatures (T-ps) of the mantle derived from this database, assuming melting by adiabatic decompression and a Ti-dependent (Fe 2 O 3 /TiO 2 - 0. 5) or constant redox condition (Fe 2 +/Sigma Fe= 0. 9 or 0. 8) in the magmatic source, {{are thought to be}} representative of different thermal "horizons' (or thermal heterogeneities) in the ambient mantle, ranging in depth from a shallow sublithospheric mantle (T-p minima) to a lower thermal boundary layer (T-p maxima). The difference of temperature (Delta T-p) observed between T-p maxima and minima did not change significantly with time (similar to 170 degrees C). Conversely, a progressive but limited cooling of similar to 150 degrees C is proposed since similar to 2. 5 Gyr for the Earth's ambient mantle, which falls in the lower limit proposed by Herzberg et al. [2010] (similar to 15 - 250 degrees C hotter than today). Cooling of the ambient mantle after 2. 5 Ga is preceded by a high-temperature plateau evolution and a transition from dominant plumes to a plate tectonics geodynamic regime, suggesting that subductions stabilized temperatures in the <b>Archaean</b> <b>mantle</b> that was in warming mode at that time...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} first {{data on the}} {{petrology}} of the mantle lithosphere of the Southeastern (SE) Slave craton, Canada. These are based on petro-graphic, mineralogical and geochemical studies of mantle xenoliths in Pipe 5034 of the Cambrian Gahcho Kue ́ kimberlite cluster. Major types of mantle xenoliths include altered eclogite, coarse garnet or spinel peridotite, and deformed garnet peridotite. The peridotites belong to the low-temperature suite and formed at T 600 [...] - 1300 C and P 25 [...] - 80 kbar in a thick (at least 220 [...] - 250 km), cool lithosphere. The SE Slave mantle is cooler than the mantle of other Archaean cratons and that below other terranes of the Slave craton. The thick lithosphere and the relatively cool thermal regime provide favourable conditions for formation and preservation of diamonds beneath the SE Slave terrane. Similar to average <b>Archaean</b> <b>mantle</b> worldwide, the SE Slave peridotite is depleted in magmaphile major elements and contains olivine with forsterite content of 91 [...] - 935.

The SE Slave spinel peridotite is poorer in Al, Ca and Fe, and richer in Mg than deeper garnet peridotite. The greater chemical depletion of the shallow upper mantle is typical of all terranes of the Slave craton and may be common for the subcontinental lithospheric peridotitic mantle in general. Peridotitic xenoliths of the SE Slave craton were impregnated by kimberlitic fluids that caused late-stage recrystallization of primary clinopyroxene, spi-nel, olivine and spinel-facies orthopyroxene, and formation of inter-stitial clinopyroxene.

40|$|The {{lower plate}} is the {{dominant}} agent in modern convergent margins characterized by active subduction, as negatively buoyant oceanic lithosphere sinks into the asthenosphere under its own weight. This is a strong plate-driving force because the slab-pull force is transmitted through the stiff sub-oceanic lithospheric mantle. As geological and geochemical data seem inconsistent with the existence of modern-style ridges and arcs in the Archaean, a periodically-destabilized stagnant-lid crust system is proposed instead. Stagnant-lid intervals may correspond to periods of layered mantle convection where efficient cooling was restricted to the upper mantle, perturbing Earth's heat generation/loss balance, eventually triggering mantle overturns. Archaean basalts were derived from fertile mantle in overturn upwelling zones (OUZOs), which were larger and longer-lived than post-Archaean plumes. Early cratons/continents probably formed above OUZOs as large volumes of basalt and komatiite were delivered for protracted periods, allowing basal crustal cannibalism, garnetiferous crustal restite delamination, and coupled development of continental crust and sub-continental lithospheric mantle. Periodic mixing and rehomogenization during overturns retarded development of isotopically depleted MORB (mid-ocean ridge basalt) mantle. Only {{after the start of}} true subduction did sequestration of subducted slabs at the core-mantle boundary lead {{to the development of the}} depleted MORB mantle source. During <b>Archaean</b> <b>mantle</b> overturns, pre-existing continents located above OUZOs would be strongly reworked; whereas OUZO-distal continents would drift in response to mantle currents. The leading edge of drifting Archaean continents would be convergent margins characterized by terrane accretion, imbrication, subcretion and anatexis of unsubductable oceanic lithosphere. As Earth cooled and the background oceanic lithosphere became denser and stiffer, there would be an increasing probability that oceanic crustal segments could founder in an organized way, producing a gradual evolution of pre-subduction convergent margins into modern-style active subduction systems around 2. 5  Ga. Plate tectonics today is constituted of: (1) a continental drift system that started in the Early Archaean, driven by deep mantle currents pressing against the Archaean-age sub-continental lithospheric mantle keels that underlie Archaean cratons; (2) a subduction-driven system that started near the end of the Archaean...|$|E

Also, {{it is thought that}} the scale and nature of heterogeneities within plumes {{and the degree to which}} heterogeneous material endures within the mantle might be reflected in spatial variations of basalt composition observed at the Earth's surface. Here we report osmium isotope data on lavas from a transect across the Azores archipelago which vary in a symmetrical pattern across what is thought to be a mantle plume. Many of the lavas from the centre of the plume have lower 187 Os/ 188 Os ratios than most ocean-island basalts and some extend to subchondritic 187 Os/ 188 Os ratios—lower than any yet reported from ocean-island basalts. These low ratios require derivation from a depleted, harzburgitic mantle, consistent with the low-iron signature of the Azores plume. Rhenium-depletion model ages extend to 2. 5 Gyr, and we infer that the osmium isotope signature is unlikely to be derived from Iberian subcontinental lithospheric mantle. Instead, we interpret the osmium isotope signature as having a deep origin and infer that it may be recycled, <b>Archaean</b> oceanic <b>mantle</b> lithosphere that has delaminated from its overlying oceanic crust.

The implied long mixing time of approximately 1 Gyr from the Hadean to Archaean for the whole mantle is paradoxical on several levels. This is much longer than the rapid mixing time (< 100 Myr) inferred for the Archean due to vigorous mantle convection related to Earth's hotter thermal regime, and similar to the mixing time inferred for the present-day Earth's mantle. Here we report a resolvable positive ¹⁴²Nd anomaly of μ¹⁴²Nd = + 7 ± 3 ppm relative to the modern convecting mantle in a 2. 7 Gyr old tholeiitic lava flow from the Abitibi Greenstone Belt in the Canadian Craton. Our result effectively extends the early Archean convective mixing time to approximately 1. 8 Gyr, i. e. even longer than present-day mantle mixing timescale, despite a more vigorous convection expected in the Archean. Different hypotheses have been examined to explain such a protracted mixing in the Archean, such as mantle overturn, two-layer convection or {{the existence of a}} dense layer {{at the bottom of the}} mantle. We postulate that the requirement of a delayed mixing in a strongly convective mantle is best explained by long periods of stasis in the global plate system, with scarce episodes of subduction throughout the Hadean and Archean. Our numerical model confirms that in absence of continuous plate tectonics, the convective mantle mixing is relatively inefficient in erasing the chemical heterogeneities inherited from the primordial differentiation of the early Earth. This constrains the tectonic regime of the Hadean and Archean to a stagnant-lid regime with episodic subduction. In this case, the timing for the onset of continuous modern plate tectonics can only occur shortly before or after 2. 7 Gyr. 1 page(s...|$|R

Mantle-derived xenoliths in Tertiary basalts from several localities across this region have been studied by X-ray fluorescence, electron microprobe and laser ablation microprobe-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry to characterize this thinner lithosphere. Trace element patterns of clinopyroxenes in the peridotites from southeastern China can be divided into four groups: fertile garnet lherzolites, fertile spinel (±garnet) lherzolites, and depleted and enriched peridotites. The addition of Nb, Sr, light rare earth elements, but not of Ti and Zr, suggests a metasomatizing agent containing both H 2 O and CO 2. This study also demonstrates that the negative Ti anomaly commonly observed in clinopyroxene from mantle peridotites cannot be balanced by the Ti in coexisting orthopyroxene, but can be explained by small degrees of partial melting, using appropriate distribution coefficients. Most of the peridotites from southeastern China, whether spinel or garnet facies, are highly fertile in terms of Al 2 O 3 and CaO contents and mg-number: many resemble commonly used primitive mantle compositions. Modelling of trace element patterns in clinopyroxene indicates that most spinel and garnet peridotites from the Nushan. Mingxi and Niutoushan localities experienced less than 5 %, and many less than 2 %, partial melting. A few depleted spinel peridotites from Nushan, and all spinel peridotites from Mingxi, require 10 - 25 % fractional partial melting: almost all spinel peridotites from the Qilin locality show evidence of higher degrees (6 - 25 %) of fractional partial melting. At both Nushan and Mingxi, the more depleted compositions occur in {{the upper part of the}} lithospheric mantle, which now is ~ 100 km thick. Garnet peridotites are essentially undepleted, and Y-Ga-Zr relationships of the garnets are typical of Phanerozoic mantle. The overall highly fertile nature of the existing lithosphere requires that the <b>Archaean</b> and Proterozoic <b>mantle</b> that existed beneath the region in Palaeozoic times has been largely or completely removed, and replaced by younger, hotter and more fertile material. This probably occured by upwelling of asthenospheric material during late Mesozoic to Cenozoic time, underplating to form new lithosphere.

We also present new in situ zircon U–Pb isotope data (by LA-ICP-MS) for associated felsic rocks. This region has experienced amphibolite to lower granulite facies metamorphism, causing re-equilibration of most mineral phases (including zircon). An intrusive tonalite sheet with a zircon U–Pb age of 2888 ± 6. 8 Ma, yields a minimum age for the GSB. The Sm–Nd and Lu–Hf isotope data do not provide meaningful isochron ages, but the isotope compositions of the mafic rocks {{are consistent with the}} ca. 2970 Ma regional volcanic event, which is documented in previous studies of the Tasiusarsuaq terrane. The major and trace element data suggest a significant crustal contribution in the petrogenesis of andesitic volcanic rocks in the GSB. The trace element variation of these andesitic leucoamphibolites cannot be explained by bulk assimilation–fractional-crystallisation (AFC) processes involving local basement. Rather, the observed patterns require binary mixing between basaltic and felsic end-member magmas with between 50 % and 80 % contributions from the latter (depending on the assumed felsic composition). Hf-isotope constraints point to contamination with pre-existing continental crust with an age of ca. 3250 Ma. Basement gneisses of this age were previously described at two localities in the Tasiusarsuaq terrane, which supports the mixing hypothesis. Thus the felsic end-member likely represents melts derived from the local basement. Ultramafic rocks (18. 35 – 22. 80 wt. % MgO) in GSB have platinum-group element (PGE) patterns that are similar to magmas derived from high-degree melting of mantle, but they have relatively enriched trace element patterns. We propose that the ultramafic rocks represent arc-related picrites or alternatively were derived by melting of metasomatised sub-continental lithospheric mantle. Overall these new geochemical data from the Mesoarchaean Grædefjord Supracrustal Belt and the petrogenetic mixing model in particular, are similar to observations from modern continental subduction zone environments, which also require large degrees of mixing with felsic basement melts. Therefore, we propose that the metavolcanic rocks formed in a modern-style subduction zone geodynamic setting, which due to the hotter <b>Archaean</b> <b>mantle</b> conditions allowed for substantial amounts of partial melting and magma mixing, rather than assimilating pre-existing continental crust...|$|E
40|$|New Sm–Nd isotope {{data are}} {{presented}} for late Archaean sanukitoid suites of the Karelian granite-greenstone terrane of the Baltic Shield. Within the terrane, there are regional {{variations in the}} Nd isotope compositions of the sanukitoids. Sanukitoids in the youngest Central Karelian domain have Nd isotope characteristics similar to depleted mantle, whereas those from the older West Karelian and Vodlozero domains have lower initial eNd values. The isotopic heterogeneity of the sanukitoids is interpreted to result from variations in the time interval between mantle source enrichment and the partial melting that produced the sanukitoid magmas. We therefore suggest a two-stage model of the generation of sanukitoid magmas. During first stage, the mantle was metasomatised by fluids and/or melts generated during subduction or tectonic underplating. Later, between 2. 74 and 2. 70 Ga, a tectonothermal anomaly generated the sanukitoid magmas by melting of the previously metasomatised mantle. Most of the sanukitoid intrusions are cut by calc-alkaline lamprophyre dykes that have the similar geochemical signatures to their sanukitoid wall rocks. New Sm–Nd isotope data for these lamprophyres suggest a genetic kinship between the sanukitoids and the lamprophyres. Comparison between chemical signatures of sanukitoids and modern, subduction-related magmas shows that Archaean sanukitoids actually have no modern analogues. Sanukitoid melts can be modelled as partial melts of mantle that had been metasomatised a short time previously. The melts {{could have been in}} equilibrium with residues containing Ol, Cpx plus minor Phl and Grt, at a pressure of about 2. 5 GPa and a temperature of 1150 – 1230 8 C. The small percentage of residual phlogopite would retain Rb in the mantle and explain the peculiar signature of low-Rb and high Ba and Sr, characteristic of the sanukitoids. We envisage a temporal evolution of the composition of the mantle in this region. This pattern of evolution controlled production of the sanukitoid melts and explains why the sanukitoids have such a restricted range of ages. Sanukitoid magma production must have followed from a major, global mantle enrichment event. These magmas could not have been produced earlier because the <b>Archaean</b> <b>mantle</b> had not become sufficiently enriched before 2. 7 Ga. We suggest that their scarcity after the major period of sanukitoid magmatism {{may be due to the}} increased thickness of overlying crust, which can inhibit mantle enrichment...|$|E
40|$|Major {{and trace}} element (Rb, Sr, Ba, Zr, Y, Nb, Ni, Co, V, Cr) data are {{presented}} for 11 spinifex-textured peridotites (STP) {{and a number}} of high-magnesian and low-magnesian tholeiitic basalts. The STP, representing high-magnesian liquids, come from the Yilgarn Block of Western Australia, Munro Township in the Abitibi Belt of Canada and one sample from the Barberton area of South Africa. All of the basaltic samples come from the Yilgarn Block. The STP and high-magnesian rocks are considered to belong to the komatiite suite (1 and 2) despite their low CaO/Al 2 O 3 ratios. It is argued that the high values (about 1. 5) reported for this ratio from the Barberton area can be explained by a combination of factors, viz. garnet separation, Al loss or Ca addition during metamorphism. The processes can be evaluated using CaO/TiO 2, Al 2 O 3 /TiO 2 ratios, the REE group and trace elements (e. g. Y, Sc). It would appear that most STP from other Archaean belts do not have abnormal CaO/Al 2 O 3 ratios. The STP display close to chondritic ratios for Ti/Zr, Zr/Nb, Zr/Y, and TiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 and are considered to represent liquids produced by large amounts of partial melting of the <b>Archaean</b> <b>mantle.</b> The data suggest that virtually all phases other than olivine were removed by melting during the production of STP liquids. In the STP, Ti/V, Ti/P ratios are non-chondritic, suggesting original depletion and/or incorporation into the core. For lower levels of partial melting, including mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) non-chondritic ratios are exhibited by Zr/Y, TiO 2 /Al 2 O 3, TiO 2 /CaO, suggesting controlling phases in the residue for Y, Ca, Al. It is apparent that for STP, Cr is not being controlled, indicating the absence of chromite in the residual. However, at about 15 % MgO the data suggest that chromite becomes a residual phase. The transition metals, with the exception of Mn, have higher abundances in Archaean basaltic rocks than in MORB. This is interpreted as being mainly due to more extensive partial melting of the mantle in the Archaean, as a result of higher temperatures. It is suggested that the generation of STP liquids with about 32 % MgO is due to upwelling mantle diapirs which probably originated at depths greater than 400 km and at temperatures in excess of 1900 °C. Modern equivalents to Archaean greenstone sequences are lacking. The closest tectonic analogue would be the development of oceanic crust within a rifted continental block...|$|E
40|$|The {{collision}} of two continents causes subduction {{of one of}} the continental margins temporarily below the other into the diamond stability field (> 3. 8 �GPa or > 120 �km depth), coeval ultra-high pressure (UHP) metamorphism of the continental crust followed by exhumation of UHP metamorphic terrains. Recent thermo-mechanical models propose that this subduction-exhumation cycle is short-lived (< 15 �Ma), contradicting the range in metamorphic ages observed in several high pressure/UHP metamorphic terrains. Here we use microstructures, mineral chemistry, Sm-Nd geochronology and Nd-Sr isotope systematics to show that the micro-diamond bearing Western Gneiss Region in the Scandinavian Caledonides of western Norway was subjected to UHP conditions for c. 30 �Ma during a long-lived cycle of subduction and exhumation related to the Scandian phase of the Caledonian orogeny. Orogenic peridotite bodies on Otr�y and Flems�y islands are interpreted as mantle wedge fragments tectonically emplaced into Baltic continental crust during the prograde continental subduction of Baltica underneath Laurentia after c. 438 �Ma. Subduction related deformation and associated strain-induced recrystallization of the mantle fragments partially to completely destroyed pyroxene exsolution microstructures in cm-scale garnet within layers of garnet-pyroxenite that have a Palaeoarchaean origin (3. 33 � 0. 19 �Ga, 2 ?, 5 point whole rock). Millimeter scale recrystallized orthopyroxene in garnet-websterite has low Al cores (? 0. 10 �wt. % Al 2 O 3) showing recrystallization conditions at UHP, 6. 3 � 0. 2 �GPa, and at sub-geotherm temperatures of Archaean areas, 870 � 50 ��C. Three mineral isochrons of 2 to 5 points from recrystallized mineral assemblages of garnet-pyroxenite indicate overlapping, early Scandian ages (429. 5 � 3. 1 �Ma, 2 ?, weighted mean) showing that the <b>Archaean</b> <b>mantle</b> fragments record the prograde subduction of Baltica to 200 �km depth underneath Laurentia in c. 8 �Ma (25 �mm a- 1 vertical subduction rate). Contrasting 87 Sr/ 86 Sr in recrystallized clinopyroxene from Otr�y and Flems�y (0. 7016 - 0. 7023 and 0. 7131, respectively) indicates strain-induced recrystallization occurred partly at dry (fluid absent) conditions. Subsequent metamorphic conditions during peridotite retrogression record exhumation through c. 120 �km depth (3. 8 �GPa), overlapping maximum metamorphic conditions recorded in regional country-rock eclogites dated at c. 400 �Ma. A slow average vertical exhumation rate of 3. 6 �mm a- 1 is implied for the diamond phase stability. Most external eclogites crystallized or re-equilibrated, probably triggered by deformation and fluids, during crustal exhumation c. 30 �Ma after the peridotites crystallized early Scandian garnets. Crustal micro-diamond - formed by long-lived but cold UHP metamorphism, and found almost exclusively in Phanerozoic orogens - suggests a change in the nature of collisional tectonics within a cooling earth. � 2009 Elsevier B.

40|$|Rare earth element (REE) {{and major}} element data are {{presented}} on 44 Archaean samples which include spinifex textured ultramagnesian lavas (STPK) spinifex textured basalts (STB) and low MgO tholeiites. The samples {{come from the}} Yilgarn and Pilbara Blocks (W. Australia), Barberton (South Africa), Belingwe and Que Que (Rhodesia), Abitibi (Canada) and the 3. 7 b. y. Isua Belt of Western Greenland. In addition REE data are given on three near primitive mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) and a glassy MORB-type basalt from Taiwan. We suggest that REE patterns, particularly the light REE and Eu, can be affected by metamorphism, but argue that the consistency of pattern from samples both within and between areas enables recognition of primary patterns. La/Sm ratios of 2. 7 b. y. STPK are characterised by being {{lower than those of}} associated basalts. The 3. 5 b. y. STPK Barberton material does not show this feature but instead displays significant heavy REE depletion. The separation of garnet from these liquids is suggested as a possible mechanism for the high CaO/Al 2 O 3 ratios, (Al loss) and the heavy REE and Sc depletion. The REE data on Barberton material is equivocal on the derivation of the so-called basaltic komatiites from the peridotitic komatiites. However, REE analyses on STPK and high magnesian lavas from elsewhere suggests that crystal fractionation is not a viable mechanism to produce one from the other. We suggest instead, that varying amounts of partial melting of different sources is responsible for the spectrum of compositions. The STB appear to be an easily recognised rock type within the Archaean. They are characterised by quench (clinopyroxene) textures and a light REE enriched pattern. It is suggested that these are near primary melts and that their REE patterns mirror their mantle source. We propose a two stage model for the 2. 7 b. y. mafic complexes, in which, prior to the generation of ultrabasic magmas, the source underwent a small amount of partial melting which resulted in the removal of a melt enriched in incompatible elements. The depletion process could be achieved either during mantle diapirism or by upward migration of interstitial melts into an Archaean low velocity zone. The spread of La/Sm ratios in STPK and STB is used as an argument that the <b>Archaean</b> <b>mantle</b> was chemically heterogeneous and that the degree of heterogeneity was similar to that observed in modern ocean volcanics. As a result, partial melting of the mantle under different P-T conditions produced a spectrum of magma types. The information presently available on Archaean mafic and silicic magmatism and the incompleteness of geochemical data on present day tectonic environments are two major obstacles in formulating Archaean tectonic models. In addition a comparison of present day and Archaean ultramafic and silicic rocks suggests that plate tectonic models as presently understood may not be suitable analogues for all Archaean tectonic environments...|$|E
40|$|Redox melting {{refers to}} any {{process by which}} melt is {{generated}} by the contact of a rock with a fluid or melt with a contrasting oxidation state. It was originally applied to melting owing to the oxidation of reduced CH₄- and H₂-bearing fluids in contact with more oxidized blocks in the mantle, particularly recycled crustal blocks. This oxidation mechanism causes {{an increase in the}} activity of H 2 O by the reaction of CH₄ with O₂, and the increased aH₂O causes a rapid drop in the solidus temperature, and is here termed hydrous redox melting (HRM). Recently, a second redox melting mechanism (carbonate redox melting; CRM) has been discovered that operates in more oxidized conditions, and may post-date the first mechanism in the same geographical area, explaining the sequence of igneous rock types from lamproites to ultramafic lamprophyres that occurs during the development of rifts through cratons. The CRM mechanism relies on the oxidation of solid carbon as graphite or diamond that has accumulated in the lithosphere over time. The solidus temperature for rocks with both CO₂ and H₂O is lower than in conditions with H₂O alone; it does not occur at depths less than 65 km, but has recently been confirmed experimentally to depths of at least 200 km. Melts produced by HRM are not SiO₂-undersaturated, even at depths of 200 km, and may often resemble lamproites or SiO₂-rich picrites, whereas melts produced by CRM are always SiO₂-undersaturated and range from carbonatitic to ultramafic lamprophyric or melilititic with increasing degree of melting. The operation of redox melting may be more common than has been recognized because the oxidation state of the upper mantle is not uniform as a function of depth, geodynamic setting or geological time. The general decrease of oxygen fugacity (fO₂) of c. 0 · 7 log units per 1 GPa pressure increase dictates that rapidly subducted oceanic lithosphere will be considerably more oxidized than ambient mantle peridotite at depths of 200 - 300 km. Hydrothermal alteration (serpentinization), addition of continental or carbonate sediments, and dehydration reactions during subduction all contribute to the heterogeneity of oxidation states in the subducted slab, which may vary over 6 log units; this raises the potential for redox reactions on local and regional scales. The oceanic lithosphere has a lower average fO₂ than either continental or cratonic mantle lithosphere at a given depth, so that the HRM mechanism dominates in recycled blocks and {{at the base of the}} continental lithosphere. The higher thermal gradients dictate that HRM is more common in the modern Earth beneath ocean islands and in upwelling mantle currents than in subduction zones. The oxidation state of the mantle is often described as having been constant since 3 · 5 Ga, but this overlooks the bias towards continental samples. Redox melting of oxidized recycled blocks (at approximately the fayalite-magnetite-quartz buffer) in the mantle was not important in the Hadean and Archaean, as it had to await the gradual oxidation of the mantle and the establishment of the subduction process, as well as the stabilization of the continents. The lack of CRM explains the lack of carbonatites before 2 · 7 Ga. However, the lower fO₂ of the Archaean asthenosphere and higher volatile contents caused more prevalent HRM in the Hadean and <b>Archaean</b> <b>mantle.</b> Degassing is controlled by solubility of volatile species in melts, which are H₂O-rich but C-poor in reducing conditions. Silicate melts under reduced conditions contain much less carbon but more nitrogen than melts in the modern mantle, arguing for a nitrogen-rich, CO₂-poor early atmosphere. 29 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Precambrian {{granulite}} {{terrain of}} the Umpavalli area forms {{a portion of}} the Eastern Ghats province of the Indian Shield in between latitude 18 ° 20 ′ 39 ″and 18 ° 25 ′ 08 ″ and longitude 82 ° 54 ′ 07 ″ and 83 ° 04 ′ 43 ″ in the Survey of India toposheet numbers 65 J/ 15 and 65 N/ 3. The granulite terrain of the Eastern Ghats province encompasses mainly khondalite and charnockite groups of rocks, and the Umpavalli area {{is one of the best}} areas to study the supracrustal rocks of the Precambrian. The carbonate rocks (dolomites and marbles) and calc-silicate rocks are included in the khondalite group of metasediments. Other members of this group are garnetiferous and non-granetiferous quartzo-feldspathic granulites/gneisses (leptynites and leptites), cordierite gneisses, quartz-K-feldspar-garnet-sillimanite±graphite gneisses (khondalites) and quartzites. The Archaean carbonate and calc-silicate rocks often show sharp contacts and intrusive relationship with khondalites. The carbonate rocks sometimes show sharp contacts with calc-silicate rocks. Khondalite enclaves are observed in the carbonate rocks in several localities, and they preserve the original alignment or deformed and folded. Carbonate rocks are pegmatitic, banded and foliated. Occasionally, the rocks show flow lines and flowage. In view of controversial reports describing intrusive carbonate rocks as metasediments and carbonatites of magmatic origin, the present study is aimed to evaluate the original parental material for these rocks. In this connection petrological association, mineral assemblages and geochemical criteria (major, minor, trace, REE, ^ Sr/^ Sr ratios) are taken into consideration to find out the parent material. Absence of certain essential features such as association of alkaline (feldspathoidal miascitic) rocks, fenitization with the introduction of alkali pyrobole and diagnostic minerals (pyrochlore, baddeleyite etc.) makes it difficult to state the intrusive carbonate rocks as carbonatites. These carbonate rocks have usual metamorphic mineral assemblages (diopside, phlogopite, fluorapatite, forsterite, humite group of mineral (s), magnesian tourmaline, graphite, pyrite etc.) of marbles and dolomites. Abundances of Ba, Sr, P, Ce, La, Y and Zr in the carbonate show no marked collective enrichment and the elemental concentration comparable to those of limestones, marbles and dolomites. Further, Ce/La and Ce+La/Y ratios are not comparable to those of carbonatites and there is no marked enrichment of Y over Ce and La suggesting metasedimentary parentage for the investigated carbonate rocks. ^ Sr/^ Sr ratio (average value 0. 7067) supports the metasedimentary origin for the carbonate rocks; this ratio is higher than the majority of the known carbonatitic occurrences (0. 7035). The investigated carbonate rocks on the whole can be regarded as allochothonous, as they show signs of displacement. This is the first report on allochothonous carbonate rocks from the Umpavalli area as well as from the Eastern Ghats province. The carbonate and calc-silicate rocks are considered originally associated with the basal strata of khondalites, and are prone to tectonic squeezing and diapiric rise during folding and refolding stages. The intrusive nature of the carbonate rocks may be due to their rheomorphic behaviour during metamorphic or deformational episodes. Hence, the carbonate rocks may be considered as tectonites rather than stratigraphic marker horizons. ^ Sr/^ Sr vs. Al and Mn vs. Sr/Ca relationships show that the investigated carbonate rocks are similar to those of sedimentary carbonates from Archaean greenstone terrains. However, these rocks show higher radiogenic ^ Sr isotopic composition than that of <b>Archaean</b> <b>mantle,</b> contemporary seawaters and many Archaean greenstone carbonates, suggesting higher radiogenic strontium in the waters of the basin; perhaps it had been contributed from continents through rivers. The deviation of ^ Sr/^ Sr values of the investigated carbonate rocks from many Archaean sedimentary carbonates can also be explained in terms of second and higher order oscillations (in response to tectonic phenomena), superimposed on first order secular oscillations, which modulated the F_C/F_M fluxes around a given steady state (see J. VEIZER : Rev. Mineral., 11, 265, 1983). These allochthonous carbonate rocks from the Eastern Ghats province can be compared with carbonaceous rocks (marbles) from Skallen in the polymetamorphic Lutzow-Holmbutka region, East Antarctica (M. YOSHIDA : J. Geosci., Osaka City Univ., 22, 97, 1979). Here the marbles intrude granulite facies rocks similar to those from the Eastern Ghats province. Many workers have described marbles and calc-silicate rocks from East Antarctica, but geochemical data are scanty. Further geochemical data are necessary among Gondwana fragments to facilitate better comparison of carbonate rocks...|$|E
