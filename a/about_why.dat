5|$|Hamilton {{points out}} {{that there have been}} many reports and books over the years {{explaining}} the climate change problem and just how ominous the future looks for humanity. He says Requiem for a Species is primarily <b>about</b> <b>why</b> those warnings have been ignored.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unknown}} why this {{hurricane}} went unnamed, {{even though it}} clearly met the criteria for doing so. Any statement <b>about</b> <b>why</b> is purely speculative at this point. The hurricane is the furthest north a tropical cyclone existed in the Eastern Pacific, and is also the northernmost existence for a Pacific hurricane. It was the only tropical cyclone {{to exist in the}} central Pacific this year. No damage or casualties were reported, although it did hassle a few ships.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written and {{directed}} by series co-creator Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. The episode was conceived from a joke among Parker and fellow co-creator Matt Stone about a fish dressed as motorcycle daredevil Evel Knievel, which eventually turned into a joke about Kanye West not understanding a joke <b>about</b> <b>why</b> liking fishsticks made him a gay fish. The way Cartman tries to steal credit for the joke was inspired by real people Parker and Stone have worked with in the television business.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, a {{panel is}} {{held for the}} office so that audience members can ask them questions. Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) openly states his distaste for the documentary. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) is pressed with questions <b>about</b> <b>why</b> she did not allow Jim to follow his dream after he has paid her so many romantic gestures. Jim attempts repeatedly to disperse the resulting tension. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) finally meets her birth parents (Ed Begley, Jr. and Joan Cusack) who had put her up for adoption.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} are being studied for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, including bedaquiline and delamanid. Bedaquiline received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in late 2012. The {{safety and effectiveness}} of these new agents are still uncertain, because {{they are based on}} the results of a relatively small studies. However, existing data suggest that patients taking bedaquiline in addition to standard TB therapy are five times more likely to die than those without the new drug, which has resulted in medical journal articles raising health policy questions <b>about</b> <b>why</b> the FDA approved the drug and whether financial ties to the company making bedaquiline influenced physicians' support for its use.|$|E
5|$|A {{railroad}} {{was being}} built {{and the population}} of Quorn hoped that it would go through the village {{on its way to}} Sioux City, Iowa. However, the railroad did not go through Quorn. One of the many ideas <b>about</b> <b>why</b> the railroad took a different route was due to a disagreement between the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company and the Close brothers. The actual reason is still unknown. Due to the railroad being the main mode of transportation of goods, the villagers {{had no choice but to}} relocate to a new area. Every business except for a mill was moved to a new area during 1883.|$|E
5|$|Bob {{has been}} fooled by Jeanie's lies <b>about</b> <b>why</b> {{they are not}} going out, and is enlightened when Sidney lets slip that Larry and Jeanie are seeing each other. Bob demands proof, and Sidney tells Bob to watch what happens in the wings during the {{upcoming}} Act 1 finale to Me and Juliet. Bob sees Larry and Jeanie kiss after she comes offstage with a tray of flowers, an action caught by Bob's spotlight. Mac enters, grasps the situation, sends Larry away, then puts the tray back in Jeanie's hands and pushes her onstage. She is pursued by Bob's spotlight, which relentlessly follows her around the stage as {{more and more of the}} dancers become aware something has gone badly wrong. Bob drops a sandbag from the light bridge; it knocks the tray Jeanie is holding to the ground. Mac orders the curtain lowered in front of a stage in panic.|$|E

5|$|Former Germany manager Berti Vogts was {{appointed}} Scotland manager in January 2002. A {{number of players}} retired from international football after Craig Brown resigned, which meant that Vogts had {{to build a new}} squad. He tried new players and formations, but the team suffered a number of heavy defeats in early friendly fixtures. Scotland reached the UEFA Euro 2004 qualification play-offs and won the first leg at home against the Netherlands, but were then beaten 6–0 in the return match. Vogts continued as manager into the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification matches, but resigned after the team took just two points from their first three matches. Debate <b>about</b> <b>why</b> Vogts had failed centred on whether Scotland had sufficient playing talent to compete, or if poor results had been due to his own failings.|$|E
5|$|Quickly, the Austrians {{acquired}} {{control of}} all the earthworks of the town, the village itself, and the fortress; their skirmishers reached {{one side of the}} abutment of an old bridge of palisades, and advanced to the other side, across the islands formed by branches of the Kinzig and the Rhine. There, almost within eye-shot of the French sentinels, they halted; there is some confusion <b>about</b> <b>why</b> they stopped. Possibly they mistook the abutment for the bridge itself, as Moreau seemed to think. Regardless, the troops there did not burn the bridge, but started plundering and drinking. The French cavalry tried to retire into Kehl via the Kinzig bridge, but the heavy Austrians fire destroyed most of them.|$|E
5|$|Rachel Duncan, {{who works}} for the Dyad Institute, {{promotes}} Delphine Cormier to the role formerly held by Leekie, who had been ordered dead when Rachel let him escape the previous night, with the official cover story that he {{died of a heart attack}} on a private jet. Rachel sets Delphine the task of convincing Professor Ethan Duncan—a founding scientist of the clone program and Rachel's adoptive father—to come into Dyad to help find a cure for the illness that has befallen Cosima Niehaus, another clone. When Ethan arrives, Rachel questions him <b>about</b> <b>why</b> she cannot reproduce, and he reveals that all of the clones were intended to be infertile by design. In response, she breaks down in anger and trashes her office.|$|E

5|$|The curious {{dealings}} led {{to congressional}} hearings <b>about</b> <b>why</b> the merger commenced without any disclosures. In September 2009, Cordray, {{on behalf of}} Ohio's largest public employee pension funds (State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio and the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System), the Teacher Retirement System of Texas and pension funds from Sweden and the Netherlands, filed suit alleging that Bank of America, its directors and four executives (Bank of America Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis, Bank of America Chief Financial Officer Joe Price, accounting chief Neil Cotty and former Merrill chairman and CEO John Thain) acted to conceal Merrill's growing losses from shareholders voted to approve the deal the prior December.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposed}} redefinition was criticised as ambiguous: Astronomer Phil Plait and NCSE writer Nick Matzke both wrote <b>about</b> <b>why</b> {{they thought}} the redefinition was not, in general, a good one. It defined a planet as orbiting a star, which would have meant that any planet ejected from its star system or formed outside of one (a rogue planet) {{could not have been}} called a planet, even if it fit all other definitions. A similar situation already applied to the term 'moon', such bodies ceasing to be moons on being ejected from planetary orbit; this usage had widespread acceptance. Similarly, the redefinition did not differentiate between planets and brown dwarf stars. Any attempt to clarify this differentiation was to be left until a later date.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{theories}} <b>about</b> <b>why</b> the hoard was buried. One is that the hoard represented a deliberate attempt to keep wealth safe, perhaps in response to one of the many upheavals facing Roman Britain in the early fifth century. This is not the only hypothesis, however. Archaeologist Peter Guest argues that the hoard was buried because the items in it were used as part of a system of gift-exchange, and as Britain separated from the Roman Empire, they were no longer required. A third hypothesis is that the Hoxne Hoard represents the proceeds of a robbery, buried to avoid detection.|$|E

5|$|Later at the Warsaw Tavern, Drew {{is hanging}} out with his friends when Mimi walks in and confronts him. Drew talks to her {{honestly}} <b>about</b> <b>why</b> she {{did not get the}} job, telling her that her attitude is the problem and she has to {{deal with the fact that}} her looks might stop her from getting some jobs. Mimi does not like Drew's advice and leaves the bar. Needing to fill the cosmetics position quickly, Drew believes he has found an ideal candidate in Natalie (Natasha Silver) until Kate turns up to apply for the job. Drew admits that he is worried that Kate will hate him if he has to fire her. However, Mr. Bell insists Drew hire Kate, having seen her in the lobby and Drew agrees. Kate later comes to Drew's house to ask him, Lewis and Oswald, which perfume samples to promote. The episode ends with Drew playing pool in his garden in the rain, while the others watch through the window.|$|E
5|$|Novakovic enjoyed {{filming the}} storyline {{because there was}} so much drama. When she was asked if she had any sympathy for Natasha during filming, she told Digital Spy that she had to because she needed to {{understand}} how her character is feeling. Novakovic also hoped viewers would have sympathy for Natasha too. The lie starts to grow out of control and Natasha is forced to make up stories <b>about</b> <b>why</b> she does not {{want to go to the}} doctor. She later buys fake ultrasound scan photos over the internet, but Summer becomes suspicious about them and discovers they are from overseas and are fake. Summer realises that Natasha has been lying about being pregnant and reveals the truth in front of Andrew and Natasha's father, shocking Natasha. Andrew does not take the news well and Michael blames himself for his daughter's actions. Novakovic hoped the experience would change Natasha and she would start to grow up. The actress added that Natasha cannot cope by herself and if she continues lying to everyone, they may turn against her.|$|E
5|$|Pam asks Jim {{to talk to}} {{her father}} and {{convince}} him to work things out with her mother. But shortly after they talk, Pam learns her father has sought a separation and will be looking for his own apartment. Pam assumes it is because of something Jim said to her father, and blames him for their breakup. Pam later confronts her father <b>about</b> <b>why</b> he left her mother while Jim looks on through the window. Pam returns to the office and tells Jim her father left because Jim told him how much he loves Pam, and he realized that he had never felt that way about her mother even at their best. Pam comes to terms with the separation and tearfully embraces Jim. Later, she expresses confidence that the two are true soul mates. Andy overhears her comments about her real life scenario, still thinks she is talking about the film they watched and concludes that he cannot be a movie critic because he is not as insightful as Jim and Pam.|$|E
