60|$|Richard {{watched for}} an {{opportunity}} of speaking to Harry, which did not at once occur, as the boy spent very little of his time at home, and, as if by tacit consent, he and Norman came in later every evening. <b>At</b> <b>last,</b> on <b>Thursday,</b> in the additional two hours' leisure allowed to the boys, when the studious prepared their tasks, and the idle had some special diversion, Richard encountered him running up to his own room to fetch a newly-invented instrument for projecting stones.|$|R

50|$|That evening, Frazer {{brings in}} a new recruit for the platoon, Mr George Clarke.

Wilson and Mainwaring are shocked at the coincidence, {{especially}} when Clarke mentions {{that he was in}} the Warwickshire Regiment (the same as Jones) and gives an accurate description of Jones.

5000|$|Willie and Tad {{became ill}} in early 1862. While Tad {{was not as}} badly affected, Willie's {{condition}} fluctuated from day to day. The most likely cause of the illness was typhoid fever, which was usually contracted by consumption of contaminated food/water. The White House drew its water from the Potomac River, along which thousands of soldiers and horses were camped. Gradually Willie weakened, and his parents spent much time at his bedside. <b>At</b> <b>last,</b> on <b>Thursday,</b> February 20, 1862, at 5:00 p.m., Willie died. Abraham said, [...] "My poor boy. He was too good for this earth. God has called him home. I {{know that he is}} much better off in heaven, but then we loved him so much. It is hard, hard to have him die!" ...|$|R

The forbidden words are "vulnerable," "entitlement," "diversity," "transgender," "fetus," "evidence-based" and "science-based. " In some instances, the analysts were given alternative phrases. Instead of “science-based” or “evidence-based,” the suggested phrase is “CDC bases its recommendations on science in consideration with community standards and wishes,” the person said. In other cases, no replacement words were immediately offered. This is the latest attempt by government departments to distort fact. As an example, the...|$|R

Specifically, the presidential proclamation of November 9, 1940 and November 8, 1941 called for observances on November 21, 1940 and November 20, 1941, respectively, the third (and second to <b>last)</b> <b>Thursdays.</b> Every such holiday in the 20th century until 1939 had fit into the former tradition, and each year from 1942 on matched a new (and [...] still current) fourth-Thursday approach.|$|R

5000|$|The {{service is}} a 1967 {{restoration}} of the rite recorded in the early 200s by the historian Hippolytus who writes of a ceremony taking place during the Easter Vigil at which two holy oils were blessed and one was consecrated. In the fifth century, the ceremony of the oils was transferred from the Holy Saturday Vigil to Holy Thursday during a special Mass for that purpose, distinct from the Mass of the Lord’s Supper. The change took place, partly, {{because of the large}} crowds that assembled for the Easter Vigil, but also to emphasize Christ’s institution of this ordained priesthood <b>at</b> Holy <b>Thursday’s</b> <b>Last</b> Supper. [...] In the decree renewing this rite Pope Paul VI said:“The Chrism Mass is one of the principal expressions of the fullness of the bishop’s priesthood and signifies the closeness of the priests with him.” ...|$|R
