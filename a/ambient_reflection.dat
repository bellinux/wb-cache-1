This paper reconsiders <b>ambient</b> <b>reflection</b> modelling of Lambertian and Phong surfaces and calculates it as reflection integrations of infinitesimal incident beams from the environment. It reveals that <b>ambient</b> <b>reflection</b> exists in variable forms for Lambertian surfaces of non-convex objects and Phong surfaces of all objects. For convex objects with Lambertian surfaces, ambient reflectance coefficient {{is actually the}} diffuse reflectance coefficient. Generalised <b>ambient</b> <b>reflection</b> models are proposed to calculate <b>ambient</b> <b>reflection</b> using the same reflection model as used in calculation of other reflections. Based on this analysis, new <b>ambient</b> <b>reflection</b> formulations of Lambertian and Phong surfaces are derived to enable efficient computations in computer graphics and image processing.

40|$|This course note {{describes}} a fast point-based method for computing diffuse and glossy global illumination, area light illumination and soft shadows, HDRI environment map illumination, multiple diffuse reflection bounces, final gathering for photon mapping, <b>ambient</b> occlusion, <b>reflection</b> occlusion, and volume scattering. The results {{are free of}} noise and the run-time does not increase due to displacement maps on surfaces, complex shaders, or dozens of complex light sources. These properties make the method suitable for movie production. The first step generates a point cloud (surfel) representation of the directly illuminated geometry in the scene. The surfels in the point cloud are organized in an octree, and the power from the surfels in each octree node is approximated either as a single large surfel or using spherical harmonics. To compute the indirect illumination at a receiving point, we rasterize the light from all surfels using three degrees of accuracy: ray tracing, disk approximation, and clusters. Huge point clouds are handled by reading the octree nodes and surfels on demand and caching them...|$|R

The simulations show that the conductor charging potential {{at the end of}} simulations does not vary with the beam density when the beam density exceeds four times the <b>ambient</b> density. The <b>reflection</b> coefficient, which determines a percentage of incident electrons reflected by the conductor, increases the charging potential. To charge the conductor to the beam energy, the reflection coefficient needs to be about 0. 5.

Amplitude spectra show general similarity between geophones and accelerometers with differences in ambient noise appearing {{to be consistent with}} the theoretical modeling. Estimating the SNR at far offsets by comparing <b>ambient</b> noise to <b>reflection</b> energy suggests a small advantage for geophones at low frequencies (< 20 Hz), and a small advantage for MEMS accelerometers above 150 Hz.

40|$|This work {{concerns}} a novel {{study in the}} field of image-to-geometry registration. Our approach takes inspiration from medical imaging, in particular from multi-modal image registration. Most of the algorithms developed in this domain, where the images to register come from different sensors (CT, X-ray, PET), are based on Mutual Infor-mation, a statistical measure of non-linear correlation between two data sources. The main idea is to use mutual information as a similarity measure between the image to be registered and renderings of the model geometry, in order to drive the registration in an iterative optimization framework. We demonstrate that some illumination-related geometric properties, such as surface normals, <b>ambient</b> occlusion and <b>reflection</b> directions can be used for this purpose. After a comprehensive analysis of such properties we propose a way to combine these sources of information in order to improve the performance of our automatic registration algorithm. The proposed approach can robustly cover a wide range of real cases and can be easily extended...|$|R
40|$|Measurement {{of light}} flicker {{according}} to current standard EN ISO 61000 - 4 - 15 is performed through measurement of voltage variations filtered by {{a model of}} a 60 W/ 230 V incandescent lamp. Hence, differences in current illumination systems technology can determine discrepancies between light flicker measurements performed under the same voltage flicker. In the paper, a method to measure light flicker with a low cost digital device, based on light intensity measurements, is proposed, thus including the lamp itself in the measurement process. In this way an objective measurement of light flicker is obtained. The metrological characterization of the device has been implemented by means of an automatic testing station which includes a standard IEC flickermeter (Norma D 6000) as reference instrument. Thanks to its portability, the instrument can be used to measure light flicker no matter the illumination system used, over a wide range of environments spanning from home/office to industrial locations, and including the environmental condition (i. e., <b>ambient</b> light and <b>reflection</b> by walls and objects) in the measurement process...|$|R
40|$|Cast shadows {{induced by}} moving objects often cause serious {{problems}} to many vision applications. We present {{in this paper}} an online statistical learning approach to model the background appearance variations under cast shadows. Based on the bi-illuminant (i. e. direct light sources and <b>ambient</b> illumination) dichromatic <b>reflection</b> model, we derive physics-based color features under the assumptions of constant ambient illumination and light sources with common spectral power distributions. We first use one Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to learn the color features, which are constant regardless of the background surfaces or illuminant colors in a scene. Then, we build up one pixelbased GMM for each pixel to learn the local shadow features. To overcome the slow convergence rate in the conventional GMM learning, we update the pixel-based GMMs through confidence-rated learning. The proposed method can rapidly learn model parameters in an unsupervised way and adapt to illumination conditions or environment changes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method is robust to scenes with few foreground activities and videos captured at low or unsteady frame rates. 1...|$|R
40|$|Rendering systems {{organized}} around the ray tracing visibility algorithm provide a powerful and general tool for generating realistic images. These systems are being rapidly adopted for offline rendering tasks, and there is increasing interest in utilizing ray tracing for interactive rendering as well. Unfortunately, standard ray tracing systems suffer from several fundamental problems that limit their flexibility and performance, and until these issues are addressed ray tracing will have no hope of replacing Z-buffer systems for most interactive graphics applications. To realize the full potential of ray tracing, {{it is necessary to}} use variants such as distribution ray tracing and path tracing that can compute compelling visual effects: soft shadows, glossy <b>reflections,</b> <b>ambient</b> occlusion, and many others. Unfortunately, current distribution ray tracing systems are fundamentally inefficient. They have high overhead for rendering dynamic scenes, use excessively detailed geometry for secondary rays, perform redundant computations for shading and secondary rays, and have irregular data access and computation patterns that are a poor match for cost-effective hardware. We describe Razor, a new software architecture for a distribution ray tracer that addresses these issues. Razor supports watertight multiresolution geometry using a novel interpolation technique and a multiresolution kD-tree acceleration structure built on-demand each frame from a tightly integrated application scene graph. This dramatically reduces the cost of supporting dynamic scenes and improves data access and computation patterns for secondary rays. The architecture also decouples shading computations from visibility computations using a two-phase shading scheme. It uses existing best-practice techniques including bundling rays into SIMD packets for efficient computation and memory access. We present an experimental system that implements these techniques, although not in real time. We present results from this system demonstrating the effectiveness of its software architecture and algorithms...|$|R
40|$|A passive {{radar systems}} {{opportunistic}} ability to exploit <b>ambient</b> radio signal <b>reflections</b> makes it ideal for covert target tracking. This strategy, {{referred to as}} passive covert radar (PCR) or passive coherent location (PCL), typically exploits FM radio or television signals from powerful local transmitters. In addition to covertness, {{the absence of a}} dedicated transmitter helps reduce costs and overall system complexity. While a variety of measurements can be used to estimate a targets position and velocity, such as time difference of arrival (TDOA) and direction of arrival (DOA), this thesis focuses on using only Doppler shift measurements to estimate a targets state. The work presented in this thesis examines the use of Doppler shift measurements from multiple receivers to solve the target tracking and association problem. A nonlinear least squares error (NLSE) estimation technique, called the Levenberg-Marquardt (L-M) algorithm, is used to determine a targets state (position, velocity) from these Doppler shift measurements. More than one target state can potentially produce identical Doppler shift profiles. In a single-receiver, single-target scenario, it is shown that three additional ghost targets caused by symmetry produce the same Doppler shift response. These ghosts may make state estimation impossible if receive antennas are not physically positioned to block out ghost targets. While the NLSE technique tends to give an accurate solution in one quadrant, three other solutions will symmetrically exist in each of the remaining three quadrants. The addition of either another receiver or another measurement (such as DOA) is needed to break this quadrant ambiguity. This thesis considers adding multiple receivers to accurately associate and track multiple targets. Two target association methods (sequential and simultaneous) are developed, and their computational requirements and accuracy are compared. A grid-aided L-M search technique is investigated in an attempt to provide a better initial target state guess to these association and tracking algorithms. The analysis and simulation results suggest it is feasible to perform multi-target association and tracking using Doppler shift as the sole measurement. Both of the proposed methods gave optimal target association and converged to reasonably accurate state estimates in most of the Monte Carlo runs. M. S.

40|$|Quality {{control of}} soft-copy {{displays}} {{is critical to}} ensure the proper contrast rendition of medical images. The American Association of Physicists in Medicine's (AAPM) Task Group 18 (TG- 18) has developed a set of testing parameters for the acceptance testing and quality control of medical grade displays. This paper addresses practical challenges associated with the broad implementation of TG- 18 in a clinical setting. First, a computer model was developed {{to determine the effects}} of ambient light variations on the contrast response of a DICOM GSDF calibrated display. The model was based on an LCD displays with diffuse reflection coefficients of 0. 0017 sr - 1, 0. 0060 sr - 1, 0. 0080 sr - 1, and 0. 0200 sr - 1. Second, the influence on display assessment due to inter-device variability and measurement techniques was established. Finally, the utility of a commercially available quality control program for remote monitoring of soft-copy displays was examined by confirming the accuracy and precision of the program. In terms of ambient light effects, the results suggest that the maximum allowable increase in ambient lighting can be determined for primary and secondary class displays by the following equations. E_max^Primary &# 8804;(- 521. 62 R_d^ 2 + 18. 822 R_d+ 0. 2511) E_cal+(0. 2169 R_d^(- 1. 002)) +E_cal E_max^Primary &# 8804;(- 423. 03 R_d^ 2 + 22. 306 R_d+ 0. 5126) E_cal+(2. 1328 R_d^(- 0. 753)) +E_cal Restricting ambient light increases to less than the &# 916;E max value will ensure that GSDF calibration is maintained. Assessment of the displays can be performed with either telescopic or contact luminance meters provided the device behaves linearly and the diffuse reflected luminance (L amb) is added to the contact measurements to generate L', the luminance perceived by the human eye. Finally, some tests recommended by TG- 18 can be implemented by the use of an automated QC system to perform many of the routine measurements. A soft-copy display quality control program can be implemented effectively and efficiently. When performing the TG- 18 recommended tests, any calibrated luminance meter can be used provided it captures L'. A commercial program can be used to facilitate these measurements. However, the contact luminance meters used by such systems should be characterized and calibrated against a stand-alone calibrated luminance meter with the required compensation for <b>ambient</b> lighting and <b>reflections.</b> Thesi...|$|R
