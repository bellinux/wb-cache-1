There were an estimated 57,849 homeless veterans estimated in the United States during January 2013, or 12 percent of all homeless adults. Just under 8 percent of homeless U.S. veterans are female. Texas, California and Florida have the highest numbers of unaccompanied homeless youth {{under the age of}} 18, comprising 58% of the total homeless under 18 youth population. Homelessness affects men more than women. At least 70% to 85% of all homeless are men.|$|E

500|$|Prose Writers of America, {{published}} in 1847, was prepared specifically {{to compete with}} a similar anthology by Cornelius Mathews and Evert Augustus Duyckinck. The prose collection earned Griswold a rivalry with the two men, which Griswold expected. As it was being published, Griswold wrote to Boston publisher James Thomas Fields that [...] "Young <b>America</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> rabid". In preparing his anthologies, Griswold would write to the living authors whose work he was including to ask their suggestions on which poems to include, {{as well as to}} gather information for a biographical sketch.|$|E

By 1982 they had a budget of $1 million and millions of volunteers. Around the same time, gay men were being stricken with AIDS, desperate for money for research and services. Spokesmen for the Moral Majority connected it to God's will, asserting the general public needed protection from [...] "the gay plague", and warned, [...] "If homosexuals are not stopped they will infect the entire nation and <b>America</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> destroyed." ...|$|E

On February 17, 2012, DeWine announced he was retracting his endorsement of Mitt Romney and endorsed Rick Santorum. DeWine said, [...] "To be elected president, you have to do more than tear down your opponents. You have to give the American people a reason to vote for you, a reason to hope, a reason to believe that under your leadership, <b>America</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> better.

The National Runaway Switchboard said in 2009 that one-third of runaway youths in <b>America</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> lured into prostitution within 48 {{hours on the}} streets. This view of adolescent prostitution in the United States as primarily driven by pimp-exploiters and other [...] "sex traffickers" [...] was challenged by SNRG-NYC [...] in their 2008 New York City study which interviewed over 300 under-age prostitutes and found that only 10% reported having pimps. A 2012 study done in Atlantic City, New Jersey, by the same group incorporated an extended qualitative ethnographic component that looked specifically at the relationship between pimps and adolescents engaged with street based sex markets. This study found the percentage of adolescents who had pimps to be only 14% and that those relationships were typically far more complex, mutual, and companionate than has been reported by social service providers, not-for-profits, {{and much of the}} news media.|$|E

Working with our Jordanian and Egyptian partners, and hopefully other Arab states, we must pursue a comprehensive peace with energy and vision....

[...] On 4 November 2007, he declared Israel's intention {{to negotiate with the}} Palestinians about all issues, stating, [...] "Annapolis will be the jumping-off point for continued serious and in-depth negotiations, which will not avoid any issue or ignore any division that has clouded our relations with the Palestinian people for many years." [...] On 29 November 2007, he warned of the end of Israel in case a two-state solution is not eventually found for the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. [...] "If the day comes when the two-state solution collapses, and we face a South African-style struggle for equal voting rights (also for the Palestinians in the territories), then, as soon as that happens, the State of Israel is finished", Olmert said {{on the last day of}} the Annapolis Conference.

2500|$|Following his {{exit from}} the US, Rajneesh {{returned}} to India, landing in Delhi on 17 November 1985. He was given a hero's welcome by his Indian disciples and denounced the United States, saying the world must [...] "put the monster America in its place" [...] and that [...] "Either America must be hushed up or <b>America</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{the end of the}} world." [...] He then stayed for six weeks in Himachal Pradesh. When non-Indians in his party had their visas revoked, he moved on to Kathmandu, Nepal, and then, a few weeks later, to Crete. Arrested after a few days by the Greek National Intelligence Service (KYP), he flew to Geneva, then to Stockholm and to Heathrow, but was in each case refused entry. Next Canada refused landing permission, so his plane returned to Shannon airport, Ireland, to refuel. There he was allowed to stay for two weeks, at a hotel in Limerick, on condition that he did not go out or give talks. He had been granted a Uruguayan identity card, one-year provisional residency and a possibility of permanent residency, so the party set out, stopping at Madrid, where the plane was surrounded by the Guardia Civil. He was allowed to spend one night at Dakar, then continued to Recife and Montevideo. In Uruguay, the group moved to a house at Punta del Este where Rajneesh began speaking publicly until 19 June, after which he was [...] "invited to leave" [...] for no official reason. A two-week visa was arranged for Jamaica but on arrival in Kingston police gave the group 12 hours to leave. Refuelling in Gander and in Madrid, Rajneesh returned to Bombay, India, on 30 July 1986.|$|E

Can America come into this dispute at the end to insist upon something better than a new diplomatic patchwork, and so obviate the later completer Armageddon? Is there, above the claims and passions of Germany, France, Britain, and the rest of them, a conceivable right thing to do for all mankind, that it might also be in the interest of America to support? Is there a Third Party solution, so to speak, which may possibly be the way out from this war? ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I use {{historical}} data {{to analyze the}} relationship between crises and growth in Latin America.

The main conclusion is that it is unlikely that Latin <b>America</b> <b>will,</b> on average, experience a major improvement in long run growth in the future. It is possible that some countries will make progress in catching up with the advanced nations. This, however, <b>will</b> not <b>be</b> the norm; most Latin American countries are likely to fall further behind in relation to the Asian countries and other emerging nations.

The main social, political, spine-character of the States will probably run along the Ohio, Missouri and Mississippi rivers, and west and north of them, including Canada. Those regions, with the group of powerful brothers toward the Pacific, (destined to the mastership of that sea and its countless paradises of islands,) will compact and settle the traits of America, with all the old retain'd, but more expanded, grafted on newer, hardier, purely native stock.
