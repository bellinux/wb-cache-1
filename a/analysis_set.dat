2500|$|The {{cardinals}} anticipated a long conclave. There was no [...] "dominating personality" [...] as Pius {{had been}} in 1939 and the customary search for contrast suggested a [...] "pastoral pope" [...] to follow a [...] "diplomatic pope". Another <b>analysis</b> <b>set</b> the likely age range between 55 and 70, with a preference for an Italian outside the curia. Several papabili were discussed. The conservative, supporting Vatican centralization of authority, Giuseppe Siri of Genoa was only 52 and his election would have meant another long papacy like that of Pius. The liberal, more disposed to granting independence to local authorities, Giacomo Lercaro of Bologna was 67. Angelo Roncalli was now the Primate of Venice after more than 25 years in the diplomatic service of the Holy See in Bulgaria, Turkey and France. Approaching 77, his age marked him as a possible compromise choice in expectation of a short pontificate, along with his [...] "reputation for being broad-minded and conciliatory". He also represented a combination of diplomatic and pastoral experience. Gregorio Pietro Agagianian, the Catholic Armenian Patriarch of Cilicia, {{had spent much of}} his adult life in Rome. He was relatively young at 63 and highly respected, but his non-Italian heritage would have made him a surprising choice. Other candidates mentioned were Ernesto Ruffini of Palermo, and two curia officials Valerio Valeri and Alfredo Ottaviani. Benedetto Masella, the 79-year-old chosen as camerlengo on 9 October, a veteran diplomat, was also mentioned as a compromise candidate with [...] "his chances diminished because of his age". Also mentioned as a radical departure from tradition was Giovanni Battista Montini, Archbishop of Milan, whom Pius had not yet made a cardinal. The New York Times cast a wide net, offering more than a dozen names, including two non-Italians, Paul-Emile Leger of Montreal and Manuel Goncalves Cerejeira of Lisbon. As the press speculated about interest in a transitional pope and possible discussions among the cardinal electors, the Vatican's mouthpiece Osservatore Romano denounced the [...] "irresponsible lightness" [...] with which the press approached the subject, especially its reports of electioneering. A Moscow radio broadcast criticized Pius for meddling in politics and hoped for a new pope devoted instead to [...] "religious problems".|$|E

5000|$|Premack's {{analysis}} of same/different led {{him and his}} associates to show that chimpanzees can do analogies. Sameness/difference is not a relation between objects (e.g., A same A, A different B) or properties, it is a relation between relations:For example: consider the relation between AA and BB, CD and EF on the one hand; and AA and CD on the other. AA and BB are both instances of same; the relation between them is [...] "same." [...] CD and EF are both instances different; the relation between them therefore is [...] "same." [...] AA is an instance of same, and CD an instance of different; the relation between them is [...] "different." [...] This <b>analysis</b> <b>set</b> the stage for teaching chimpanzees the word [...] "same" [...] for AA, and [...] "different" [...] for CD. When taught these words, chimpanzees spontaneously formed simple analogies between: physically similar relations (e.g., small circle is to large circle as small triangle is to large triangle), and functionally similar relations (e.g., key is to lock as can opener is to can).|$|E

His opening paragraph stated:"Call me a converted skeptic. Three years ago I identified problems in previous climate studies that, in my mind, threw doubt on the very existence of global warming. Last year, following an intensive research effort involving a dozen scientists, I concluded that global warming was real and that the prior estimates of the rate of warming were correct. I'm now going a step further: Humans are almost entirely the cause." [...] He said that their findings were stronger than those shown in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report. Their <b>analysis,</b> <b>set</b> out in five scientific papers now being subjected to scrutiny by others, had used statistical methods which Robert Rohde had developed and had paid particular attention to overcoming issues that skeptics had questioned, including the urban heat island effect, poor station quality, data selection and data adjustment. In the fifth paper which they now made public, they fitted the shape of the record to various forcings including volcanoes, solar activity and sunspots. They found that the shape best matched the curve of the calculated greenhouse effect from human caused greenhouse gas emissions.
