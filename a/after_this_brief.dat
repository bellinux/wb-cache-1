5|$|With {{few other}} options {{available}} to him, the President of the Assembly, Jean Joseph Mounier, accompanied a deputation of market-women into the palace to see the king. A group of six women nominated by the crowd were escorted into the king's apartment, where they told him of the crowd's privations.

25|$|<b>After</b> <b>this</b> <b>brief</b> synthesis, Neo-Classical {{reaction}} was totally dominant until 1955. Rationalist buildings were still common in industrial architecture, but extinct in urban projects. Last isolated constructivist buildings were launched in 1933–1935, such as Panteleimon Golosov's Pravda building (finished 1935), the Moscow Textile Institute (finished 1938) or Ladovsky's rationalist vestibules for the Moscow Metro. Clearly Modernist competition entries {{were made by}} the Vesnin brothers and Ivan Leonidov for the Narkomtiazhprom project in Red Square, 1934, another unbuilt Stalinist edifice. Traces of Constructivism can also be found in some Socialist Realist works, for instance in the Futurist elevations of Iofan's ultra-Stalinist 1937 Paris Pavilion, which had Suprematist interiors by Nikolai Suetin.|$|E

By now the BEF was cut off from the bulk of the French armies, and began its retreat towards Dunkirk. 50th Division was sent north to Ypres, where it found an open flank where the Belgians had already retreated. It began a planned withdrawal, providing a rearguard for the eastern flank of the BEF, suffering heavy casualties from bombardment as it did so. By the night of 31 May–1 June {{the division}} was back across the French frontier, in reserve to the French defenders. The division, less its heavy equipment, was evacuated from Dunkirk on 1 June and landed in the United Kingdom the following day.|$|E

After Phu had outlined the military situation in the Central Highlands, he asked Thieu to bolster the South Vietnamese 6th Air Force Division with more aircraft and additional brigades to defend Kontum and Pleiku. Thieu refused to send further reinforcements because the South Vietnamese military no longer had the resources. Phu was ordered to move all his units down to the Mekong region where they could continue fighting. General Vien cautioned against moving large military formations down Highway 19; he reminded Thieu of the destruction suffered by the French Mobile Group 100 in the region in 1954. Thieu and his commanders made the decision to use Route 7 instead, in an attempt to surprise the North Vietnamese, who would not expect them to use that road due to its poor condition.|$|R

25|$|First-class cricket was not {{established}} in the colony until the Rhodesian team began taking part in South Africa's Currie Cup competition from 1904–05. The initial first-class match was against Transvaal cricket team on 15–16 March 1905, at Johannesburg. Rhodesia lost by an innings and 170 runs. <b>After</b> <b>this</b> <b>brief</b> appearance, Rhodesia did not {{take part in the}} Currie Cup again until 1929–30. They played also in 1931–32, winning four out of five matches, but losing the cup to Western Province under the points system then in use. The Rhodesian team then did not return to until 1946–47, after which they at last played regularly. In the intervening period, Denis Tomlinson became Rhodesia's first Test cricketer when he was selected to tour England with the South African cricket team in 1935, Chris Duckworth the second for the English tour of 1955, and Tony Pithey the third against England in the home series of 1956/57.|$|E

2500|$|Work on the {{foundations}} was complete by 30 June and the erection {{of the iron}} work was started. Although no more than 250 men were employed on the site, a prodigious amount of exacting preparatory work was entailed: the drawing office produced 1,700 general drawings and 3,629 detail drawings of the 18,038 different parts needed. The task of drawing the components was complicated by the complex angles involved {{in the design and}} the degree of precision required: the positions of rivet holes were specified to within 0.1mm (0.04in) and angles worked out to one second of arc. The components, some already riveted together into sub-assemblies, were first bolted together, the bolts being replaced by rivets as construction progressed. No drilling or shaping was done on site: if any part did not fit it was sent back to the factory for alteration. The four legs, each at an angle of 54° to the ground, were initially constructed as cantilevers, relying on the anchoring bolts in the masonry foundation blocks. Eiffel had calculated that this would be satisfactory until they approached halfway to the first level: accordingly work was stopped for the purpose of erecting a wooden supporting scaffold. This gave ammunition to his critics, and lurid headlines including [...] "Eiffel Suicide!" [...] and [...] "Gustave Eiffel has gone mad: he has been confined in an Asylum" [...] appeared in the popular press. At this stage a small [...] "creeper" [...] crane was installed in each leg, designed to move up the tower as construction progressed and making use of the guides for the elevators which were to be fitted in each leg. <b>After</b> <b>this</b> <b>brief</b> pause erection of the metalwork continued, and the critical operation of linking the four legs was successfully completed by March 1888.

40|$|The {{objective}} of <b>this</b> <b>brief</b> is to carefully illustrate a procedure of applying linear parameter-varying (LPV) control {{to a class}} of dynamic systems via a systematic synthesis of gain-scheduling controllers with guaranteed stability and performance. The existing LPV control theories rely {{on the use of}} either H-infinity or H 2 norm to specify the performance of the LPV system.  The challenge that arises with LPV control for engineers is twofold. First, there is no systematic procedure for applying existing LPV control system theory to solve practical engineering problems from modeling to control design. Second, there exists no LPV control synthesis theory to design LPV controllers with hard constraints. For example, physical systems usually have hard constraints on their required performance outputs along with their sensors and actuators. Furthermore, the H-infinity and H 2 performance criteria cannot provide hard constraints on system outputs. As a result, engineers in industry could find it difficult to utilize the current LPV methods in practical applications. To address these challenges, gain-scheduling control with engineering applications is covered in detail, including the LPV modeling, the control problem formulation, and the LPV system performance specification. In addition, a new performance specification is considered which is capable of providing LPV control design with hard constraints on system outputs. The LPV design and control synthesis procedures in <b>this</b> <b>brief</b> are illustrated through an engine air-to-fuel ratio control system, an engine variable valve timing control system, and an LPV control design example with hard constraints. <b>After</b> reading <b>this</b> <b>brief,</b> the reader will be able to apply a collection of LPV control synthesis techniques to design gain-scheduling controllers for their own engineering applications. <b>This</b> <b>brief</b> provides detailed step-by-step LPV modeling and control design strategies along with a new performance specification so that engineers can apply state-of-the-art LPV control synthesis to solve their own engineering problems.

40|$|In this {{approach}} to discrete quantum gravity the basic structural element is a covariant causal set ($c$-causet). The geometry of a $c$-causet is described by a shell-sequence that determines the discrete gravity of a universe. In this growth model, universes evolve in discrete time by adding new vertices to their generating $c$-causet. We first describe an inflationary period that is common to all universes. <b>After</b> <b>this</b> very <b>brief</b> cycle, the model enters a multiverse {{period in which the}} system diverges in various ways forming paths of $c$-causets. At the beginning of the multiverse period, the structure of a four-dimensional discrete manifold emerges and quantum mechanics enters the picture. A natural Hilbert space is defined and a discrete, free Dirac operator is introduced. We determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this operator. Finally, we propose values for coupling constants that determine multiverse probabilities. These probabilities predict the dominance of pulsating universes. Comment: 23 page...|$|R
