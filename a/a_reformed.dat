40|$|Within this report, we want {{to plead}} in favour for <b>a</b> <b>reform</b> of jobs which are regular but {{not covered by the}} social {{insurance}} system ('geringfuegige Beschaeftigung). Reasons for <b>a</b> <b>reform</b> are given in detailed analysis of trends in the development of 'geringfuegige Beschaeftigung', of the effects on firms and employees, of its implications on competition and labour market policies and its consequences for the social insurance system. From our point of view it points out that there are more arguments supporting <b>a</b> <b>reform</b> instead of continuing with the current regulations. Furthermore, an international comparison of regulations in nine European countries shows that most of the countries manage without similar bounds of social insurance. Finally, standards for <b>a</b> <b>reform</b> of these jobs in Germany will be elaborated and suggestions for <b>a</b> <b>reform</b> presented by the new government will be commented. (orig.)

40|$|This paper {{examines}} transition {{dynamics in}} a search economy. We contrast two extreme cases: <b>a</b> completely unexpected <b>reform</b> and <b>a</b> fully anticipated <b>reform.</b> We view the former {{as a metaphor for}} <b>a</b> <b>reform</b> being announced and implemented with immediate effect, the latter as a metaphor for <b>a</b> <b>reform</b> being announced in advance of its implementation. In contrast to models with convex adjustment costs, we show that announcing the reform in advance leads to stagnation in anticipation of the reform and output cycles after the implementation that are more volatile than if <b>a</b> <b>reform</b> of identical magnitude had been implemented immediately. This provides, therefore, an argument in favour of immediately implementing <b>a</b> <b>reform</b> as against announcing it in advance with a delayed implementation. One could interpret this is an argument in favour of 'shock therapy' as against 'gradualism', where the latter has the specific connotation of delaying reform (rather than sequencing it slowly).
