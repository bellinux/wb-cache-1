6000|$|Finally, the {{experiments}} recorded {{in this chapter}} show {{us that there is}} a remarkable accordance in the power of digestion between the gastric juice of animals with its pepsin and hydrochloric acid and the secretion of Drosera with its ferment and acid belonging to the <b>acetic</b> <b>series.</b> We can, therefore, hardly doubt that the ferment in both cases is closely similar, [page 135] if not identically the same. That a plant and an animal should pour forth the same, or nearly the same, complex secretion, adapted for the same purpose of digestion, is a new and wonderful fact in physiology. But I shall have to recur to this subject in the fifteenth chapter, in my concluding remarks on the Droseraceae. [page 136] ...|$|E
40|$|The 13 C {{resonance}} of the carbonyl and carboxyl carbons in the compounds {{listed in the}} title has been studied by Fourier transform NMR at 61 MHz. in benzoic acid the complete shielding tensor σ was determined from a single crystal study. The shielding is largest when the magnetic field is perpendicular to the molecular plane and smallest when {{it is in the}} plane bisecting the OCO angle. The principal elements of the σ tensor of silver benzoate and benzoic acid anhydride obtained from powder spectra show relatively small deviations from the values found in benzoic acid, contrary to the situation in the corresponding <b>acetic</b> acid <b>series.</b> The mean shielding anisotropy δAσ = σzz - 12 (σxx+σyy) for the central carbon increases from 151 ppm in benzophenone to 280 ppm in thiobenzophenone. In terms of an MO description it is shown that for the carbonyl carbon the dominating contributions to the principal elements of σ arise from very few single electron excitations. One of these is the n → π* transition, for which the excitation energy can be obtained from the optical spectra...|$|R

40|$|Investigations {{have been}} made on obtaining of {{nanosized}} powders of titanium carbide (TiC) by carbothermal reduction of a precursor prepared by sol-gel process. Two methods of precursor gels fabrication of TiC were used: Ti (IV) chloride, ethyleneglycol and citric acid (series A) and Ti (IV) n-propoxide, saccharose and <b>acetic</b> acid (<b>series</b> B). The resulting xerogels are calcined under flowing argon at different temperatures ranging from 800 °C to 1400 °C with holding time from 0. 5  h to 10  h. TiC nanopowders were obtained with the specific surface area of 30  m 2 /g – 200  m 2 /g {{and the size of}} TiC crystallites of 40  nm – 45  nm. Only the TiC phase has been found by the XRD analysis, but the presence of also some oxygen and free carbon depending on synthesis conditions has been found by chemical analysis. For compacting investigations with spark plasma sintering (SPS) method (1800 °C, heating rate of 100 °C /min and dwelling time of 5 min.) TiC nanopowder (SSA of 88  m 2 /g, containing 72. 7  wt. % Ti, 6. 6  wt. % O, 20. 5  wt. % C total and 7. 2  wt. % C free) was used. The sintering begins at 1150 °C, but change of density ends at 1650 °C. The density at this temperature reaches only 89  % of the theoretical and does not rise until 1800 °C. This is probably due to the presence of free carbon in investigated sample, retarding sintering. A significant decrease of admixtures has been observed in ceramic material during sintering.

6000|$|It {{follows from}} these few facts that {{different}} kinds of seeds excite the leaves in very different degrees; whether this is solely {{due to the nature}} of their coats is not clear. In the case of the cress seeds, the partial removal of the layer of mucus hastened the inflection of the tentacles. Whenever the leaves remain inflected during several days over seeds, it is clear that they absorb some matter from them. That the secretion penetrates their coats is also evident from the large proportion of cabbage, raddish, and cress seeds which were killed, and from several of the seedlings being greatly injured. This injury to the seeds and seedlings may, however, be due solely to the acid of the secretion, and not to any process of digestion; for Mr. Traherne Moggridge has shown that very weak acids of the <b>acetic</b> <b>series</b> are highly injurious to seeds. It never occurred to me to observe whether seeds are often blown on to the viscid leaves of plants growing in a state of nature; but this can hardly fail sometimes to occur, as we shall hereafter see in the case of Pinguicula. If so, Drosera will profit to a slight degree by absorbing matter from such seeds.] ...|$|E
60|$|In not one {{of these}} ten cases was the whole of the gluten dissolved, even when very small bits were given. I {{therefore}} asked Dr. Burdon Sanderson to try gluten in artificial digestive fluid of pepsin with hydrochloric acid; and this dissolved the whole. The gluten, however, was acted on much more slowly than fibrin; the proportion dissolved within four hours being as 40.8 of gluten to 100 of fibrin. Gluten was also tried in two other digestive fluids, in which hydrochloric acid was replaced by propionic [page 119] and butyric acids, and it was completely dissolved by these fluids at the ordinary temperature of a room. Here, then, at last, we have a case in which it appears that there exists an essential difference in digestive power between the secretion of Drosera and gastric juice; the difference being confined to the ferment, for, as we have just seen, pepsin in combination with acids of the <b>acetic</b> <b>series</b> acts perfectly on gluten. I believe that the explanation lies simply in the fact that gluten is too powerful a stimulant (like raw meat, or phosphate of lime, or even too large a piece of albumen), and that it injures or kills the glands before they have had time to pour forth a sufficient supply of the proper secretion. That some matter is absorbed from the gluten, we have clear evidence in the length of time during which the tentacles remain inflected, and in the greatly changed colour of the glands.|$|E
6000|$|... [Globulin or Crystallin.--This {{substance}} was kindly {{prepared for}} {{me from the}} lens of the eye by Dr. Moore, and consisted of hard, colourless, transparent fragments. It is said* that globulin ought to [...] "swell up in water and dissolve, for the most part forming a gummy liquid;" [...] but this did not occur with the above fragments, though kept in water for four days. Particles, some moistened with water, others with weak hydrochloric acid, others soaked in water for one or two days, were placed on nineteen leaves. Most of these leaves, especially those with the long soaked particles, became strongly inflected in a few hours. The greater number re-expanded after three or four days; but three of the leaves remained inflected during one, two, or three additional days. Hence some exciting matter must have been absorbed; but the fragments, though perhaps softened in a greater degree than those kept for the same time in water, retained all their angles as sharp as ever. As globulin is an albuminous substance, I was astonished at this result; and my object being to compare the action of the secretion with that of gastric juice, I asked Dr. Burdon Sanderson to try some of the globulin used by me. He reports that [...] "it was subjected to a liquid containing 0.2 per cent. of hydrochloric acid, and about 1 per cent. of glycerine extract of the stomach of a dog. It was then ascertained that this liquid was capable of digesting 1.31 of its weight of unboiled fibrin in 1 hr.; whereas, during the hour, only 0.141 of the above globulin was dissolved. In both cases an excess of the substance to be digested was subjected to the liquid." [...] We thus see that within the same time less than one-ninth by weight of globulin than of fibrin was dissolved; and bearing in mind that pepsin with acids of the <b>acetic</b> <b>series</b> has only about one-third of the digestive power of pepsin with hydrochloric acid, {{it is not surprising that}} the fragments of ...|$|E
40|$|Human aldose reductase (ALR 2) {{has evolved}} as a {{promising}} therapeutic {{target for the}} treatment of diabetic long-term complications. The binding site of this enzyme possesses two main subpockets: the catalytic anion-binding site and the hydrophobic specificity pocket. The latter can be observed in the open or closed state, depending on the bound ligand. Thus, it exhibits a pronounced capability for induced-fit adaptations, whereas the catalytic pocket exhibits rigid properties throughout all known crystal structures. Here, we determined two ALR 2 crystal structures at 1. 55 and 1. 65 A resolution, each complexed with an inhibitor of the recently described naphtho[1, 2 -d]isothiazole <b>acetic</b> acid <b>series.</b> In contrast to the original design hypothesis based on the binding mode of tolrestat (1), both inhibitors leave the specificity pocket in the closed state. Unexpectedly, the more potent ligand (2) extends the catalytic pocket by opening a novel subpocket. Access to this novel subpocket is mainly attributed to the rotation of an indole moiety of Trp 20 by about 35 degrees. The newly formed subpocket provides accommodation of the naphthyl portion of the ligand. The second inhibitor, 3, differs from 2 only by an extended glycolic ester functionality added to one of its carboxylic groups. However, despite this slight structural modification, the binding mode of 3 differs dramatically from that of the first inhibitor, but provokes less pronounced induced-fit adaptations of the binding cavity. Thus, a novel binding site conformation has been identified in a region where previous complex structures suggested only low adaptability of the binding pocket. Furthermore, the two ligand complexes represent an impressive example of how the slight change of a chemically extended side-chain at a given ligand scaffold can result in a dramatically altered binding mode. In addition, our study emphasizes the importance of crystal structure analysis for the translation of affinity data into structure-activity relationships...|$|R
40|$|In the {{reaction}} of N-isopropyl-N-phenyl- 2, 2 '-bipyridin- 6 -amine with potassium tetrachloroplatinate, the selective C-H bond activation was complicated by the low selectivity of sp² C-H bond activation in acetonitrile and low yield of sp³ C-H activation in acetic acid. The product resulting from the highly selective sp³ activation was collected in low yield due to competing side reactions. Following C[superscript]iPr-N bond dissociation, the platinum complex (2 a, X = NH, R = H) was regioselectively acylated. It was later discovered that 2 a could be regioselectively acylated by reacting with acetic anhydride in acetic acid. Furthermore, the acylated platinum complex (3 a, X = NH, R = H) was also prepared in a cascade intramolecular cycloplatination-acylation reaction by reacting the organic ligand (1 a, X = NH, R = H) with potassium tetrachloroplatinate {{in a mixture of}} acetic acid and <b>acetic</b> anhydride. A <b>series</b> of ligands with structural modifications have been designed, synthesized, cycloplatinated, and acylated to investigate the scope of this reaction, and to shed light on the mechanism of the acylation. The reaction showed great tolerance to various linker groups (X), as well as many electron donating/withdrawing groups (R) on the phenyl ring. Reaction conditions were optimized and a variety of solvents were useful in this reaction, including acetonitrile, benzonitrile, and 1, 2 -dichloroethane. Alternate electrophiles such as benzoyl chloride were also useful in the acylation reaction. Experimental results of the acylation reaction of a library of substrates (2) will be reported, and the mechanistic implications of these results will be discussed. M. S...|$|R
40|$|The {{biorefinery}} is {{a system}} that uses as feedstocks biomasses and recover from these energy, fuel and chemicals. There are many processes considered in the biorefinery system, but in this thesis the biorefinery that uses as feedstock oil, in particular dedicated crops and waste vegetable oils were considered. 	 In {{the first part of this}} thesis the biodiesel production process was studied. One possible route to produce biodiesel from waste oils (carachetrized by high concentrations of Free Fatty Acids, FFAs), is the use of a two steps process: an esterification reaction of FFAs with glycerol and a successive transesterification reaction with methanol of the whole mixture using a basic catalyst. In this thesis the esterification step of FFAs with glycerol, in presence of a new acid heterogeneous catalyst based on sulfonated polymers with enhanced temperature resistance, was studied. The use of this type of catalyst has the advantage of using a relatively high temperature favouring the reaction by stripping of water formed during the esterification The use of an acid catalyst that is able to tranesesterify the glycerides and to esterify the FFAs is onther way to obtained biodiesel from waste or non edible oils. In this thesis the reactions of contemporany esterification of FFAs and tranesterification of glycerides were studied using new homogeneous or supported homogneous Zn(II) catalysts and a NbO 2 /SiO 2 heterogeneous catalyst. The second part of this thesis was devoted to study of new catalysts for chlorination reaction of glycerol recovered from biodiesel production process. The behavior of three series of homologous catalysts, chloroacetic acid <b>series</b> (<b>acetic</b> acid, monochloroacetic, dichloroacetic and trichloroacetic acid), glycolic acid series (glycolic acid, di‐glycolic acid and thio‐glycolic acid) and amminoacid series (glutamic acid, aspartic acid and cysteine), were investigated for their activity and selectivity to produce dichlorohydrins, important intermediates for epichlorohydrin production. In the present study we explored also a completely new class of catalysts for glycerol chlorination, represented by acyl chlorides, never reported in the literature. The catalysts studied are acetyl chloride, propanoyl chloride, adypoyl chloride, butandioil di-chloride, propandioil di-chloride and phenylacetyl chloride and more precisely it is reported a comparison between the acyl chlorides respect to corresponding carboxylic acid. The influence of some reaction parameters are studied as for example the effects of the pressure on activity and selectivity. Finally I use acyl chloride in stoichiometric amount in order to open new opportunities for chlorination process of glycerol with hydrochloric acid performed in situ...|$|R
60|$|We may {{infer that}} the {{carbonate}} of ammonia is {{absorbed by the}} glands, not only from its action being so rapid, but from its effect being somewhat {{different from that of}} other salts. As the glands, when excited, secrete an acid belonging to the <b>acetic</b> <b>series,</b> the carbonate is probably at once converted into a salt of this series; and we shall presently see that the acetate of ammonia causes aggregation almost or quite as energetically as does the carbonate. If a few drops of a solution of one part of the carbonate to 437 of water (or 1 gr. to 1 oz.) be added to the purple fluid which exudes from crushed tentacles, or to paper stained by being rubbed with them, the fluid and the paper are changed into a pale dirty green. Nevertheless, some purple colour could still be detected after 1 hr. 30 m. within the glands of a leaf left in a solution of twice the above strength (viz. 2 grs. to 1 oz.); and after 24 hrs. the cells of the pedicels close beneath the glands still contained spheres of protoplasm of a fine purple tint. These facts show that the ammonia had not entered as a carbonate, for otherwise the colour would have been discharged. I have, however, sometimes observed, especially with the long-headed tentacles on the margins of very pale leaves immersed in a solution, that the glands as well as the upper cells of the pedicels were discoloured; and in these cases I presume that the unchanged carbonate had been absorbed. The appearance above described, of the aggregating process being arrested for a short time at each transverse partition, impresses the mind with the idea of matter passing downwards from cell to cell. But as the cells one beneath the other undergo aggregation when inorganic and insoluble particles are placed on the glands, the process must be, at least in these cases, one of molecular change, transmitted from the glands, [page 45] independently of the absorption of any matter. So it may possibly be {{in the case of the}} carbonate of ammonia. As, however, the aggregation caused by this salt travels down the tentacles at a quicker rate than when insoluble particles are placed on the glands, it is probable that ammonia in some form is absorbed not only by the glands, but passes down the tentacles.|$|E
40|$|The TIM-barrel folded enzyme Aldose reductase (ALR 2) is a {{valuable}} model system to study structural and thermodynamic features of inhibitor binding and, furthermore, represents an excellent drug target. To prevent diabetic complications derived from enhanced glucose flux via the polyol pathway the development of aldose reductase inhibitors (ARIs) has been established as a promising therapeutic concept. Its attraction as a test system consists furthermore in the high mobility and adaptivity properties of its active site residues, giving rise to various distinct binding pocket conformers and pronounced induced-fit adaptations upon ligand binding. In chapter 2, we combine a structural characterization of the experimental binding modes observed for two virtual screening hits with isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements providing insights into the driving forces of inhibitor binding. The nitro group binds {{to the bottom of}} the specificity pocket and provokes remarkable induced-fit adaptations. Identically constituted ligands, lacking this nitro group, exhibit an affinity drop of one order of magnitude. In addition, thermodynamic data suggest a strongly favourable contribution to binding enthalpy in case the inhibitor is equipped with a nitro group at the corresponding position. As these data suggest, the nitro group provokes the enthalpic contribution, in addition to the H-bond mentioned above, by accepting two “non-classical” H-bonds donated by the aromatic tyrosine side chain. In chapter 3, we report on the crystal structures of a novel sulfonyl-pyridazinone inhibitor in complex with aldose reductase. The inhibitor occupies with its pyridazinone head group the catalytic site whereas the chloro-benzofurane moiety penetrates into the opened specificity pocket. The high resolution structure provides some evidence that the pyridazinone group binds in a negatively charged deprotonated state whereas the neighboring His 110 residue most likely adopts a neutral uncharged state. In chapter 4, we probed the ALR 2 binding site with a novel structural class of inhibitors in order to identify putative pocket adaptations. We elucidated two ALR 2 crystal structures, each complexed with a member of the recently described naphtho[1, 2 -d]isothiazole <b>acetic</b> acid <b>series.</b> In contrast to the original design hypothesis based on the binding mode of tolrestat, both inhibitors leave the specificity pocket in closed state. Unexpectedly, the more potent ligand extends the catalytic pocket by opening of a novel subpocket. The second studied inhibitor differs from the first only by an extended glycolic ester functionality added to one of its carboxylic groups. However, despite this slight structural modification, its binding mode differs dramatically from that of the first inhibitor. The two ligand complexes represent an impressive example, how the slight change of a chemically extended side chain at a given ligand scaffold can result in a dramatically altered binding mode. In addition, our study emphasizes the importance of crystal structure analysis for the translation of affinity data into structure-activity relationships. In chapter 5, we study the binding process of inhibitors to ALR 2 with respect to changes of the protonation inventory upon complex formation. As the protonation event will strongly contribute to the enthalpic signal recorded during ITC experiments, knowledge about the proton-accepting and -releasing functional groups of the system is of utmost importance. Here, we present pKa calculations complemented by mutagenesis and thermodynamic measurements suggesting a tyrosine residue located in the catalytic site (Tyr 48) as likely candidate to act as proton acceptor upon inhibitor binding, as it occurs deprotonated to remarkable extent if only the cofactor NADP+ is bound. Binding thermodynamics of IDD 388, IDD 393, tolrestat, sorbinil, and fidarestat are discussed in the context of substituent effects. In chapter 6, the ALR 2 binding site is probed for selectivity determining features, which make binding of certain ligands to ALR 2 more attractive than to the concurrent isoform aldehyde reductase (ALR 1). The resulting mutational constructs of ALR 2 are probed for their influence towards ligand selectivity by X-ray structure analysis of the corresponding complexes and ITC. Accurate crystal structure-determination of protein-ligand complexes is the starting point for further design hypotheses to predict novel leads with improved properties. This widely accepted practise relies on the assumption that the crystal structure of a given protein-ligand complex is unique and independent of the protocol applied to produce the crystals. In chapter 7, we present two examples indicating that this assumption is not generally given...|$|R
