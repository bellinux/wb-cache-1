5|$|The {{first model}} to be commercially {{manufactured}} was the Mk I in 1963. An updated version, the Mk II, was released {{the following year}} which featured the full set of sounds selectable by banks and stations. The instrument was expensive, costing £1,000, at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> typical house cost £2,000–£3,000.|$|E
5|$|In Prussia, {{a reform}} in 1816 defined the Prussian civil pound {{in terms of}} the Prussian foot and {{distilled}} water. It also redefined the apothecaries' pound as 12 ounces, i.e. 3/4, of the civil pound: 350.78g. This reform was not popular with apothecaries, because it broke the uniformity of the apothecaries' pound in Germany at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> German national state was beginning to form. It seems that many apothecaries did not follow this reduction by 2%.|$|E

5|$|R.C. MacLeod {{wrote of}} another {{tradition}} which {{stated that the}} flag was waved at a battle in Waternish, in about 1580; and of another which told of how it was waved during <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> cattle plague was raging, and that it stopped the murrain. R.C. MacLeod stated his belief that the flag would only have been waved twice, and so rejected the tradition of it being unfurled at the Battle of Bloody Bay—because the MacLeods were on the losing side! R.C. MacLeod also wondered {{if it had been}} waved in 1600, when the clan was in a desperate state in the midst of warring with the Macdonalds of Sleat.|$|E
5|$|Confidence in the British bomber {{force was}} low. Having had no anti-shipping attack training, {{their ability to}} inflict damage to the ships was poor. The main hope {{was placed in the}} torpedo bomber force made up mainly of the Beaufort and Swordfish {{aircraft}} of Coastal Command and the Fleet Air Arm. Beauforts of No. 42 Squadron RAF, No. 86 Squadron RAF and No. 217 Squadron RAF were made available from Coastal Command for the mission, but were short of torpedoes. The three torpedo squadrons were the only ones available on 12 February 1942. Some 57 Bristol Beauforts had been diverted to other theatres, leaving a chronic shortage of torpedo bombers in Britain at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> major enemy naval operation was expected. Moreover, a further two squadrons (No. 415 and No. 489 Squadron RAF) had been withdrawn to convert to Handley Page Hampdens. No. 22 Squadron RAF {{was in the midst of}} a transfer to the Middle East at the time of the German operation.|$|E
5|$|Taylor's exhortations to the Vietnamese {{officers}} to remove Khánh {{were not a}} secret, and it had an unwanted side-effect; it accelerated coup action from figures not favored by Washington. The likes of Kỳ, Thiệu, Có and Cang were {{not yet ready to}} stage a coup, and their preparations were well behind those of Thảo, an unstinting plotter. On February 14, the commander of the Marine Brigade General Lê Nguyên Khang reported to an American official that he was involved in plotting against Khánh but said he and the other Young Turks were not ready because the military was not sufficiently united. He said they had to wait for <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> coup could be carried out without generating unspecified side-effects. Khang was aware Thảo was planning a move with some generals who were now on the outer. He anticipated trouble in trying to keep his subordinates from joining Thảo, as his men might not wait for the younger generals to launch their coup if they thought it would never come.|$|E

25|$|Alongside his cricket career, Commaille {{was also}} {{prominent}} in South African Association football {{as both a}} player and an administrator; in 1913, he was the honorary secretary of the Football Association of South Africa at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> triangular Commonwealth series of internationals between England, South Africa and Australia was proposed (and rejected).

25|$|Although short (169cm/ 5' 6½"), Moore {{played at}} full-forward for Essendon. At <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> team's best goal-kicker usually played at centre-half forward, {{he was their}} leading goal-kicker in 1898 (his first full season) with 20 goals.

25|$|In 1916 the NAWSA {{purchased}} the Woman's Journal from Alice Stone Blackwell. The newspaper {{had been established}} in 1870 by Blackwell's mother, Lucy Stone, and had served as the primary voice of the suffrage movement {{most of the time}} since then.

25|$|There {{have been}} fewer notable English {{players who have}} played in Scotland. Joe Baker was {{the first player to}} play for England without having played in the Football League, but his was an {{isolated}} example because he played at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> player was only allowed to play for the country of his birth. Those rules have subsequently been relaxed and the sons or even grandsons of Scots are now allowed to play for Scotland. This means that some English-born players have played in and for Scotland, including Andy Goram and Stuart McCall.|$|E
25|$|His rise in {{influence}} and his approval of world revolution {{led him to}} seek Lenin's support for a Bolshevik government over Romania, at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> similar attempt was being made by the Odessa-based Romanian Social Democratic Action Committee, {{under the guidance of}} Mihai Gheorghiu Bujor; Stelian Tănase claims that during the period, a group of one hundred Russian Bolsheviks had infiltrated Iaşi with the goal of assassinating King Ferdinand I and organizing a coup. Eventually, Lenin decided in favor of a unified project, and called on Bujor and Rakovsky to form a single leadership (which also included the Romanian expatriates Alecu Constantinescu and Ion Dic Dicescu).|$|E
50|$|The main {{narrative}} {{starts as}} he recalls <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>an</b> opal miner, {{who was a}} boarder at the boy's home, steals the narrator's father's car and commits suicide in the back seat, having gambled away his friends' money; this death allows a supernatural being {{to gain access to}} our world, leaving money for people in unpleasant ways.|$|R

25|$|Further to {{what has}} been {{mentioned}} it should be stressed that a good well-aged pu'er tea is not evaluated by its age alone. Like all things in life, there will come <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> pu'er teacake reaches its peak before stumbling into a decline. Due to the many recipes and different processing method used in the production of different batches of pu'er, the optimal age for each age will vary. Some may take 10 years while others 20 or 30+ years. It is important to check the status of ageing for your teacakes to know when they peaked so that proper care can be given to halt the ageing process.|$|E
25|$|The Roadmaster {{was a big}} car, in sedan form tipping {{the scales}} at 4,098 pounds, some 88 pounds heavier than Cadillac's new Series 60. But pricewise, the Roadmaster was a {{tremendous}} bargain. The sedan sold for $1,255, $440 less than the least expensive Cadillac. The only other body style available was a four-door convertible phaeton, priced at $1,565 (of which only 1064 were produced), at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> Cadillac in the same body style sold at prices ranging from $2,745 to $7,850. Buick’s new engineering and styling was a big hit, with model year sales more than tripling from just over 48,000 to nearly 158,000, and with the all new Series 80 Roadmaster contributing a total of 16,049 units to that number.|$|E
25|$|The {{outdated}} {{layout of}} the half-cab single deck and its low seating capacity exercised the minds {{of a number of}} operators from the mid-1950s. Barton Transport converted PS1s to 27ft 6in long double-deckers and Tiger PS2s, including the former City coach to 30ft double deckers, the later ones carrying fully fronted Northern Counties double-deck bodies. Yorkshire Traction, in the BET group did systematic conversions of most of their fleet of Tigers from about 1955-63, using Charles H. Roe or Northern Counties bodies, Yorkshire Woollen District later following suit. Yorkshire Traction also oversaw the rebodying of five PS2s for Stratford Blue Motors, costed refurbishing the chassis at £500 and purchasing the bodies at £3,000 per bus at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> complete PD2 would cost over £5,000. Alexander took the running units from its 17 OPS2s in 1961 and fitted them into new Titan PD3 frames, then fitted units from scrapped PS1s into the former OPS2s. When fitted with new Alexander bodies the recycled double-deckers could only be distinguished from similar new deliveries in that they retained the traditional radiator and bonnet from the Tigers whilst the new buses had full-width bonnets. Ulster Transport Authority also rebodied many of its Tigers in the 1950s, using new Leyland Titan PD2 chassis frames and Metro-Cammell bodyframes completed at UTA's Belfast coachworks. CIÉ stripped a late batch of OPS3s of their units and purchased new Titan PD3 frames and St Helens Style glassfibre bonnets, and had the vehicles assembled in 1961-62 complete with Park Royal body frames by a company called Commercial Road Vehicles who were renting part of the former Great Northern Railway (Ireland) central works in Dundalk. These 'R900' Titans were CIÉ's last front-engine double-deckers, again the R series had started in 1934 with Dublin United Transport.|$|E
