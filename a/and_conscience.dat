25|$|Taylor, Anne-Marie. Young Charles Sumner and the Legacy of the American Enlightenment, 1811–1851 (U. of Massachusetts Press, 2001. 422 pp.) Disagrees with Donald and {{contends that}} Sumner internalized republican {{principles}} of duty, education, and liberty balanced by order. He was also shaped by Moral Philosophy, the dominant strain of American Enlightenment thinking, which included cosmopolitan ideals and a {{stress on the}} dignity of intellect <b>and</b> <b>conscience.</b> He was also keen {{on the idea of}} Natural Law. These influences came from readings and his close ties to John Quincy Adams, William Ellery Channing, and Joseph Story. Taylor says Sumner sought an American culture combining American liberty with European culture. He became a reformer regarding education, the arts, prison discipline, world peace, and anti-slavery. He saw reform work as a duty to work for the public good.|$|E

[...] Academics Gonzalo Villalta Puig and Steven Tudor have called for the court to broaden Section116 by finding in it an implied right to the freedom of thought <b>and</b> <b>conscience.</b> In their view most Australians correctly [...] "believe that the Constitution protects the right to freedom of thought <b>and</b> <b>conscience</b> just like it protects other civil and political freedoms", and that the court should give effect to that belief. They argue there is precedent for the court finding implied constitutional rights, such as the 1992 case of Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth, where the court found that the Constitution guaranteed the freedom of political communication.|$|E
