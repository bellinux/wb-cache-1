Gushee, {{director}} of Mercer University's Center for Theology and Public Life, named Jesus for President {{one of the}} five best books about patriotism, the others being Bonhoeffer's Ethics; Bruce Lincoln's Religion, Empire and Torture; Reinhold Niebuhr's Moral Man <b>and</b> <b>Immoral</b> Society; and A Testament of Hope, a collection of Martin Luther King Jr.'s speeches and writings.|$|E
5|$|The Republicans {{convened in}} Chicago and {{nominated}} former Speaker of the House James G. Blaine of Maine for {{president on the}} fourth ballot. Blaine's nomination alienated many Republicans who viewed Blaine as ambitious <b>and</b> <b>immoral.</b> The GOP standard bearer was weakened by alienating the Mugwumps, and the Conkling faction, recently disenfranchised by President Arthur. Democratic party leaders saw the Republicans' choice {{as an opportunity to}} win the White House {{for the first time since}} 1856 if the right candidate could be found.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{campaign}} against the Catholic Church, hundreds of monasteries in Germany and Austria were confiscated by the Gestapo and their occupants were expelled. In 1941 the Catholic Bishop of Münster, August von Galen, publicly protested against this persecution and against Action T4, the Nazi non-voluntary euthanasia programme under which the mentally ill, physically deformed, and incurably sick were to be killed. In a series of sermons that received international attention, he criticised the programme as illegal <b>and</b> <b>immoral.</b> His sermons led to a widespread protest movement among church leaders, the strongest protest against a Nazi policy up until that point. Bormann and others called for Galen to be hanged, but Hitler and Goebbels concluded that Galen's death would only {{be viewed as a}} martyrdom and lead to further unrest. Hitler decided {{to deal with the issue}} when the war was over.|$|E

50|$|Five Minerals Powder {{was used}} medicinally in the 2nd century BCE, became a popular {{recreational}} entheogen and stimulant, known as Cold-Food Powder, among prominent counterculture literati during the 3rd century, <b>and</b> was deemed <b>immoral</b> <b>and</b> condemned after the 10th century.|$|R
5|$|Since the Bronze Age of Comics, the Joker {{has been}} {{interpreted}} as an archetypal trickster, displaying talents for cunning intelligence, social engineering, pranks, theatricality, and idiomatic humor. Like the trickster, the Joker alternates between malicious violence and clever, harmless whimsy. He is amoral and not driven by ethical considerations, but by a shameless and insatiable nature, and although his actions are condemned as evil, he is necessary for cultural robustness. The trickster employs amoral <b>and</b> <b>immoral</b> acts to destabilize {{the status quo and}} reveal cultural, political, and ethical hypocrisies that society attempts to ignore. However, the Joker differs in that his actions typically only benefit himself. The Joker possesses abnormal body imagery, reflecting an inversion of order. The trickster is simultaneously subhuman and superhuman, a being that indicates a lack of unity in body and mind. In Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth, the Joker serves as Batman's trickster guide through the hero's own psyche, testing him in various ways before ultimately offering to cede his rule of the Asylum to Batman.|$|E
25|$|Plotinus attacks {{his opponents}} as untraditional, irrational <b>and</b> <b>immoral</b> and arrogant. He also attacks them as elitist and blasphemous to Plato for the Gnostics despising the {{material}} world and its maker.|$|E
25|$|Another episode which alleges corrupt <b>and</b> <b>immoral</b> {{practices}} by the Brahmin priests at Srirangam and Thiruchendur cannot obviously be missed. The followers of Ayyavazhi were {{called upon to}} don the mantle of priesthood {{in the place of}} the Brahmins.|$|E

25|$|Robert Graves – Another {{real life}} character, Graves {{is a fellow}} poet and friend of Sassoon who sees the war as unjust <b>and</b> <b>immoral.</b> However, Graves {{does not want to}} make his life more {{difficult}} by protesting. Graves sees it as his duty to serve his country regardless of his own moral beliefs.|$|E
25|$|The anti-religious {{propaganda}} {{attempted to}} show a relationship between religious belief <b>and</b> <b>immoral</b> or criminal behaviour. This included a revision of Russian history, in which religious figures were condemned. Fr Gapon, {{the leader of the}} Bloody Sunday March in January 1905 who was praised by Lenin, was turned into a Japanese spy, and Patriarch Tikhon was alleged to have been affiliated with British capitalists.|$|E

25|$|The {{argument}} that this policy affords the public {{a sense of}} revenge and retribution could serve to justify acts both illegal <b>and</b> <b>immoral.</b> Clearly, lawbreakers ought to be punished. Yet, no matter how horrific their deeds, as the targeting of Israeli civilians indeed is, they should be punished according to the law. David's arguments could, in principle, justify the abolition of formal legal systems altogether.|$|E
25|$|Conventionally, clans {{adopted the}} five degrees of {{mourning}} according to unwritten definitions that determines {{the difference between}} close and distant relatives. As such, marriage between relatives that were covered within the five degrees of mourning was considered taboo <b>and</b> <b>immoral.</b> These definitions, unlike the mourning ritual, are still applicable in determining whether a marriage is acceptable, albeit fewer people {{are familiar with the}} mourning rituals themselves.|$|E
25|$|The main {{political}} issue {{addressed by the}} speech was not immigration as such, however. It was the introduction by the Labour Government of the Race Relations Act 1968, which Powell found offensive <b>and</b> <b>immoral.</b> The Act would prohibit discrimination {{on the grounds of}} race in certain areas of British life, particularly housing, where many local authorities had been refusing to provide houses for immigrant families until they had lived in the country for a certain number of years.|$|E

25|$|After a {{total of}} three years' probation, newly joining members would take an oath that {{included}} the commitment to practice piety towards God (το θειον) and righteousness towards humanity, to maintain a pure lifestyle, to abstain from criminal <b>and</b> <b>immoral</b> activities, to transmit their rules uncorrupted and to preserve the books of the Essenes and the names of the Angels. Their theology included belief in the immortality of the soul and that they would receive their souls back after death. Part of their activities included purification by water rituals, which was supported by rainwater catchment and storage.|$|E
25|$|The {{period was}} also infamous for papal corruption, with many Popes fathering children, and {{engaging}} in nepotism and simony. The corruption of the Popes and the huge expenses for their building projects led, in part, to the Reformation and, in turn, the Counter-Reformation. Alexander VI, for example, was well known for his decadence, extravagance <b>and</b> <b>immoral</b> life. Under extravagant and rich popes, Rome {{was transformed into a}} centre of art, poetry, music, literature, education and culture. Rome became able to compete with other major European cities of the time in terms of wealth, grandeur, the arts, learning and architecture.|$|E
25|$|The {{title is}} a {{reference}} to a fictional bureaucratic stipulation which embodies forms of illogical <b>and</b> <b>immoral</b> reasoning. The opening chapter of the novel was originally published in New World Writing as Catch-18 in 1955, but Heller's agent, Candida Donadio, requested that he change the title of the novel, so it would not be confused with another recently published World War II novel, Leon Uris's Mila 18. The number 18 has special meaning in Judaism (it means Alive in Gematria; see Chai) and was relevant to early drafts of the novel which had a somewhat greater Jewish emphasis.|$|E
50|$|Illegal, <b>Immoral</b> <b>and</b> Fattening is a 1975 comedy rock album {{recorded}} by Howard Kaylan ("Eddie") and Mark Volman ("Flo"). A {{majority of the}} album comes from live recordings, including three songs that {{first appeared in the}} 1974 film Down and Dirty Duck. Illegal, <b>Immoral</b> <b>and</b> Fattening and Moving Targets were reissued on a single compact disc in 2007 by Acadia Records.|$|R

25|$|As in his novels, Djerassi's plays {{incorporate}} {{the life and}} achievements of (sometimes famous) scientists {{as well as new}} scientific technologies. The science in his plays is always scientifically plausible although the dramatic personae and locations are fictitious. By placing scientists and research into dramatic worlds, he raises critical questions about the sciences as cultural systems and looks into internal conflicts and contradictions in science and between scientists. The constant competition between them, the need for priority in new scientific discoveries even if the required speed necessitates risky <b>and</b> <b>immoral</b> means, as well as the problematic consequences of new discoveries are important topics of the plays.|$|E
25|$|In 1862, {{with the}} ranks of the Union army swelled by more than 100,000 volunteers, the U.S. {{government}} believed it could now spare enough men to again occupy the Utah Territory. In addition, it was important to protect the overland mail route and telegraph lines along what later became known as the California Trail. Col. Patrick E. Connor marched into Utah with a regiment of California volunteers. His soldiers, of the 3rd California Infantry, constructed a small garrison just three miles (5km) east of the Mormon stronghold of Salt Lake City. The post, named Camp Douglas for former Illinois presidential candidate and congressman Stephen A. Douglas, was officially established on October 26, 1862. Connor at once engaged in an acrimonious and bitter cold war with Brigham Young and the Mormon people, whom he accused of being disloyal <b>and</b> <b>immoral.</b> During the rest of the war, the fort served as the headquarters of the District of Utah in the Department of the Pacific.|$|E
25|$|The {{participants}} of the Asilomar Conference also endeavored to bring science into {{the domain of}} the general public, with a possible motivation being the Watergate scandal. The scandal resulted from a bungled break-in at the Watergate hotel, which served as the Democratic National Committee headquarters in 1972. Two years after the burglary, taped evidence was discovered that indicated that President Nixon had discussed a cover-up a week after it. Three days following the release of the tape, Nixon resigned from his presidential office. This event focused the nation’s attention on the problem of government secrecy fostering illegal <b>and</b> <b>immoral</b> behavior and it has been suggested by the political scientist, Ira H. Carmen, that this motivated the scientists at the Asilomar Conference to bring science into the public eye to ensure {{that they would not be}} accused of a cover-up. Additionally, according to Dr. Berg and Dr. Singer, by being forthright, scientists avoided restrictive legislation due to the development of a consensus on how they were to conduct their research.|$|E
50|$|The Legionaries of Christ {{accused the}} founder, the Rev. Marcial Maciel Degollado, {{who died in}} 2008, of “reprehensible <b>and</b> objectively <b>immoral</b> behavior” {{as head of the}} order from its {{founding}} in 1941 until Pope Benedict XVI removed him in 2006.|$|R
