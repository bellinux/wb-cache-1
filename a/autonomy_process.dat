The introduction of the notion of laziness allows a flexible trade-off between the cost for checkpoint coordination and the average rollback distance. Worst-case overhead analysis provides a means for estimating the extra checkpoint overhead.

40|$|Although {{the quality}} of parent-adolescent {{emotional}} bonds has consistently been proposed as {{a major influence on}} young adult's psycho-emotional functioning, the precise means by which these bonds either facilitate or impede adaptive coping are not well-understood. In an effort to advance this inquiry, the present study examined interrelationships among measures of parental attachment, emotion regulation processes, and preferred coping strategies within a sample of 942 college freshmen. Structural Equation Modelling was used to test whether the link between attachment to parents and the use of particular coping strategies is mediated by differences in emotion regulation mechanisms. As hypothesized, differences in attachment to parents predicted differences in the use of emotion regulation mechanisms and coping strategies. More specifically, having a close emotional bond, feeling supported in <b>autonomy</b> <b>processes</b> and having (moderately) low levels of separation anxiety toward parents predict more constructive emotion regulation mechanisms and coping strategies.

This braiding of old and new forms of communication technologies is what allows Radio Insurgente to be so successful, as it can simultaneously reach the rural populations through the more traditional medium of radio and reach the urban populations through the more modern medium of the Internet. The Internet audio version of the radio network was launched in November 2004 to celebrate the 21st anniversary of the EZLN movement and focused on recordings of local indigenous musicians and story-tellers to political speeches by movement leaders and helped to serve as a recorded history of Mexico's indigenous people.|$|E
