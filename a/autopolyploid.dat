40|$|Polyploidy {{has played}} an {{important}} role in higher plant evolution and applied plant breeding. Polyploids are commonly categorized as allopolyploids resulting from the increase of chromosome number through hybridization and subsequent chromosome doubling or <b>autopolyploids</b> due to chromosome doubling of the same genome. Allopolyploids undergo bivalent pairing at meiosis because only homologous chromosomes pair. For <b>autopolyploids,</b> however, all homologous chromosomes can pair at the same time so that multivalents and, therefore, double reductions are formed. In this article, we use a maximum-likelihood method to develop a general polyploid model for estimating gene segregation patterns from molecular markers in a full-sib family derived from an arbitrary polyploid combining meiotic behaviors of both bivalent and multivalent pairings. Two meiotic parameters, one describing the preference of homologous chromosome pairing (expressed as the preferential pairing factor) typical of allopolyploids and the other specifying the degree of double reduction of <b>autopolyploids,</b> are estimated. The type of molecular markers used can be fully informative vs. partially informative or dominant vs. codominant. Simulation studies show that our polyploid model is well suited to estimate the preferential pairing factor and the frequency of double reduction at meiosis, which should help to characterize gene segregation in the progeny of <b>autopolyploids.</b> The implications of this model for linkage mapping, population genetic studies, and polyploid classification are discussed...|$|R

5000|$|There are {{two major}} {{divisions}} of polyploidy, allopolyplody and autopolyploidy. Allopolyploids arise {{as a result of}} the hybridization of two related species, while autopolyploids arise from the duplication of a species' genome as a result of hybridization of two conspecific parents, or somatic doubling in reproductive tissue of a parent. Allopolyploid species are believed to be much more prevalent in nature, possibly because allopolyploids inherit different genomes, resulting in increased heterozygosity, and therefore higher fitness. These different genomes result in an increased likelihood of large genomic reorganizations, which can be either deleterious, or advantageous. Autopolyploidy, however, is generally considered to be a neutral process, though it has been hypothesized that autopolyploidy may serve as a useful mechanism for inducing speciation, and therefore assisting in the ability of an organism to quickly colonize in new habitats without undergoing the time-intensive and costly period of genomic reorganization experienced by allopolyploid species. One common source of autopolyploidy in plants stems from [...] "perfect flowers", which are capable of self-pollination, or [...] "selfing". This, along with errors in meiosis that lead to aneuploidy, can create an environment where autopolyploidy is very likely.

2500|$|Polysomic {{inheritance}} {{occurs during}} meiosis when chiasmata form between {{more than two}} homologous partners, producing [...] chromosomes. <b>Autopolyploids</b> may show polysomic inheritance of all the linkage groups, and their fertility may be reduced due unbalanced chromosome numbers in the gametes. [...] In tetrasomic inheritance, four copies of a linkage group rather than two (tetrasomy) assort two-by-two.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Autopolyploids</b> are polyploids with {{multiple}} chromosome sets {{derived from a}} single taxon. Two examples of natural <b>autopolyploids</b> are the piggyback plant, Tolmiea menzisii and the white sturgeon, Acipenser transmontanum. [...] Most instances of autopolyploidy result from the fusion of unreduced (2n) gametes, which results in either triploid (n + 2n = 3n) or tetraploid (2n + 2n = 4n) offspring. Triploid offspring are typically sterile (as in the phenomenon of 'triploid block'), {{but in some cases}} they may produce high proportions of unreduced gametes and thus aid the formation of tetraploids. This pathway to tetraploidy {{is referred to as the}} “triploid bridge”. Triploids may also persist through asexual reproduction. In fact, stable autotriploidy in plants is often associated with apomictic mating systems. In agricultural systems, autotriploidy can result in seedlessness, as in watermelons and bananas. Triploidy is also utilized in salmon and trout farming to induce sterility.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{polyploidy}} events, {{there are}} several possible fates for duplicated genes; both copies may be retained as functional genes, change in gene function may occur in one or both copies, gene silencing may mask one or both copies, or complete gene loss may occur. [...] Polyploidy events will result in higher levels of heterozygosity, and, over time, can {{lead to an increase}} in the total number of functional genes in the genome. As time passes after a genome duplication event, many genes will change function as a result of either change in duplicate gene function for both allo- and <b>autopolyploid</b> species, or there will be changes in gene expression caused by genomic rearrangements induced by genome duplication in allopolyploids. When both copies of a gene are retained, and thus the number of copies doubled, there is a chance {{that there will be a}} proportional increase in expression of that gene, resulting in twice as much mRNA transcript being produced. There is also the possibility that transcription of a duplicated gene will be down-regulated, resulting in less than two-fold increase in transcription of that gene, or that the duplication event will yield more than a two-fold increase in transcription. [...] In one species, Glycine dolichocarpa (a close relative of the soybean, Glycine max), it has been observed that following a genome duplication roughly 500,000 years ago, there has been a 1.4 fold increase in transcription, indicating that there has been a proportional decrease in transcription relative to gene copy number following the duplication event.|$|E

The frequency of multivalents required to produce this degree of double reduction was determined through simulation. We also determined the effect that multivalents or preferential pairing between homologous chromosomes has on linkage mapping.

40|$|The Medicago sativa complex {{comprises}} several morphologically and genetically diverse diploid and <b>autopolyploid</b> taxa, including autotetraploid cultivated alfalfa (M. sativa subsp. sativa). Its {{members can}} be divided into three morphological groups: M. sativa subsp. caerulea and subsp. sativa with blue flowers and coiled pods, subsp. falcata with yellow flowers with falcate pods, and subsp. glomerata with yellow flowers and coiled pods; each group contains both diploid and tetraploid cytotypes. Although alfalfa is well studied, closely related tetraploids and their hypothesized diploid progenitors have received much less study. Questions regarding their relationships, their controversial taxonomy, and <b>autopolyploid</b> evolution remain to be addressed. Genetic variation and differentiation were estimated, and phylogenetic and network relationships were constructed based on nucleotide sequences from the mitochondrial genome for the diploid members of the complex, and from chloroplast and nuclear genomes for both the diploid and tetraploid members. Independent perspectives on the species' evolutionary history were afforded because each genome has a different inheritance pattern. Mitochondrial DNA is maternally inherited, chloroplast DNA is biparentally, but largely paternally inherited, and nuclear DNA is biparentally inherited. At the diploid level, subsp. caerulea is genetically differentiated from diploid subsp. falcata for chloroplast haplotypes and nuclear alleles, although there are some shared haplotypes and alleles probably due to limited gene flow. Data from mitochondrial haplotypes, however, show no differentiation between the two diploids, which is likely due to bidirectional introgression of the mitochondrial genome. At the tetraploid level, genetic differentiation was found between subsp. sativa and tetraploid subsp. falcata in both the chloroplast and nuclear genomes. Although chloroplast data support a simple <b>autopolyploid</b> origin of subsp. sativa from diploid subsp. caerulea, a contrasting history involving past introgression from closely related M. prostrata is suggested for tetraploid subsp. falcata, raising questions about its <b>autopolyploid</b> origin. Nuclear data, however, show that tetraploid falcata most likely has originated from diploid falcata through autopolyploidy in a similar pattern to that of subsp. sativa.

40|$|Switchgrass is {{considered}} one of the most promising energy crops. However, breeding of elite switchgrass cultivars is required to meet the challenges of large scale and sustainable biomass production. As a native perennial adapted to North America, switchgrass has lowland and upland ecotypes, where most lowland ecotypes are tetraploid (2 n= 4 x= 36), and most upland ecotypes are predominantly octoploid (2 n= 8 x= 72). Hybridization between lowland and upland switchgrass plants could identify new cultivars with heterosis. However, crossing between tetraploid and octoploid switchgrass is rare in nature. Therefore, in order to break down the cross incompatibility barrier between tetraploid lowland and octoploid upland switchgrass lines, we developed autoployploid switchgrass lines from an anueploid lowland cv. Alamo. In this study, colchicine was used in liquid and solid mediums to chemically induce chromosome doubling in embryogenic calli derived from cv. Alamo. Thirteen <b>autopolyploid</b> switchgrass lines were regenerated from seedlings and identified using flow cytometry. The autoplyploid switchgrass plants exhibited increased stomata aperture and stem size in comparison with the cv. Alamo. The most autooplyploid plants were regenerated from switchgrass calli that were treated with 0. 04 % colchicine in liquid medium for 13 days. One <b>autopolyploid</b> switchgrass line, VT 8 - 1, was successfully crossed to the octoploid upland cv. Blackwell.

We analyzed these data for the characteristics that differ between allopolyploids and <b>autopolyploids,</b> including the segregation ratio of each marker, the ratio of single-dose (SD) to multi-dose (MD) markers, the ratio of SD markers in coupling to those in repulsion and the banding patterns of the SSRs. Whereas the analysis of the segregation ratio of each polymorphic marker indicated disomic (13 markers) as well as hexasomic (eight markers) inheritance, the ratio of SD markers in coupling to those in repulsion was 1 : 0, which is characteristic of <b>autopolyploids.</b> The observed ratio of SD to MD markers was close to 0. 7 : 0. 3 which is significantly different to the expected segregation for auto- and allohexaploids. Furthermore, the three EST-SSR alleles were inherited in all possible combinations and were not independent of each other, as expected for fixed heterozygosity in allopolyploids. Combining our results with published cytological data indicates that cultivated chrysanthemums should be classified as segmental allo-hexaploids...|$|R
40|$|Heterosis, after {{a century}} from its discovery, is still today the {{greatest}} biological phenomenon existing in nature {{that can be}} exploited for breeding plant varieties through the constitution of F 1 hybrids. The actions and interactions of genes linked in chromo- some blocks allow to explain heterosis in diploids, fixed heterosis in allopolyploids of selfing species and progressive heterosis in <b>autopolyploids</b> of outcrossing species. With {{the advent of the}} genomic era, experimental data are now shedding light on the genetic factors and molecular networks that control the expression of heterosis in plants. The discovery of male-sterility was crucial because it enables to control fertilization through the selection of pure lines or inbreds to be used as seed parent in controlled crosses with genetically divergent pollinators...|$|R
