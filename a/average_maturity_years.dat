40|$|The model {{proposed}} by Merton(1981) {{to determine the}} value of forecasting ability is adapted to investigate whether money market fund managers successfully anticipate changes in the yield curve by adjusting the <b>average</b> <b>maturity</b> of their portfolios in the right direction. The potential economic value of such behavior is assessed, and it is shown that if the portfolios of all money market funds were aggregated {{it would appear that}} managers are good forecasters even if individually they possess insignifcant forecasting ability. At the same time, the economic value of the aggregate portfolio will be diminished because of the reduced net change in <b>average</b> <b>maturity.</b> Thus, diversifying into many money market funds will not attain the gain that could be realized if an individual manager had a forecasting ability equal {{to the quality of the}} average forecast. A sample of 34 money market funds is investigated.

This paper assesses the macroeconomic implications of tax-based versus spending-based consolidation {{within the framework of}} a New Keynesian model with long term government debt. Three results stand out: First, tax-based consolidations are inflationary whereas spending-based ones are deflationary. Second, the net benefits of inflation increase in the <b>average</b> <b>maturity</b> of outstanding debt: inflation revalues debt more efficiently, while distortions due to price dispersion remain unaffected - the maturity effect. Third, as a result, tax-based consolidations can become superior to spending cuts if the <b>average</b> <b>maturity</b> is high enough. Quantitatively, the threshold is two years for US data in 2013. The previous mechanism illustrates the importance of inflation in the consolidation process, even if raising its target rate is considered not to be an option...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A {{database}} of maturity and quality indices {{was built by}} analysis of 62, 807 samples of 100 ‘Gala’ apples and 29, 053 samples of 100 ‘Fuji’ apples at harvest, over 11 years (2005 - 2015) in an apple industry warehouse. Apple fruit were harvested in Fraiburgo (SC), São Joaquim (SC) and Vacaria (RS). Data on firmness, starch index (SI), soluble solid content (SS), titratable acidity (TA), size and grades (external appearance) of apple fruit were submitted to linear and nonlinear regression analyses. Each fruit was graded by analysis of external qualities (color and surface blemishes) following Brazilian legal standards. At apples industry, the harvest period extended from 3 rd to 15 th week {{of the year for}} ‘Gala’ and from 10 th to 22 nd week of the year for ‘Fuji’ apples, although approximately 70 % of total production for ‘Gala’ and ‘Fuji’ apples was harvested in a period of 4 and 6 weeks, respectively. <b>Average</b> <b>maturity</b> of 11 <b>years</b> varied from the 1 st to the last week of harvest as follows: ‘Gala’ apples: 17. 9 to 14. 2 pounds (firmness), 4. 0 to 6. 1 (SI), 12. 2 to 13. 1 % (SS) and 5. 7 to 3. 9 meq 100 mL- 1 (TA). ‘Fuji’ apples: 17. 1 to 14. 3 pounds (firmness), 3. 9 to 6. 4 (SI), 12. 9 to 14. 4 % (SS), 6. 2 to 3. 8 meq 100 mL- 1 (TA). Approximately 48 % of ‘Gala’ samples and 45 % of ‘Fuji’ samples had firmness higher than 17 and 16 pounds, respectively, intended for long term storage, while 6 % of ‘Gala’ samples and 8. 5 % of ‘Fuji’ samples had firmness lower than 14 pounds, intended for marketing shortly after harvest.

40|$|A current {{outgrowth}} of the nearly four decades of research in capital structure is the investigation of linkages between the firm's decisions and factors outside of strictly financial determinants. The three essays that comprise this dissertation offer contributions to this area of research. The first essay explores {{the connection between the}} product market and the firm's financial decisions. I hypothesize that market power acts as a buffer against strategic action {{on the part of a}} competitor and the existence of market power allows the firm to hold more debt in its capital structure. Using a binary choice model, I find that firms with market power have a higher propensity to issue public debt rather than public equity. In addition, no evidence is found suggesting agency costs have a significant impact on the security issue decision. The second essay is an extension of an analytical model of the free-cash-flow hypothesis developed by Stulz (1990). Debt can increase the value of a firm by reducing the amount of cash the manager can misappropriate or invest in personal projects. The extension is developed under the assumption that the stockholders do not know with certainty the mean of the cash flow distribution. The extension drives two main results: one, the amount of debt in the capital structure of a firm is dependent upon the precision of the shareholders' a priori estimate of future cash flows; and, two, the maturity of the firm's debt is dependent upon the shareholders' estimate of the mean of future cash flow. The third essay empirically explores the relationship between the firm's maturity structure of debt and the firm's maturity structure of assets. New variables are constructed to specifically test the maturity-matching hypothesis. The dependent variable is the change in <b>average</b> <b>maturity</b> of debt caused by a new issue. An independent variable measures the difference between the <b>average</b> <b>maturity</b> of debt and the <b>average</b> <b>maturity</b> of assets.

40|$|The {{maturity}} {{structure of the}} U. S. government's outstanding debt has undergone large changes over time, {{at least in part}} because of shifts in the Treasury's debt management policy. During most of the post World War I 1 period, an emphasis on short-term issues rapidly reduced the debt's <b>average</b> <b>maturity.</b> In the early 1960 's and again since 1975, however, the opposite policy just as rapidly lengthened (and is now lengthening) the <b>average</b> <b>maturity,</b> Such changes in debt management policy in general affect the structure of relative asset yields as well as nonfinancial economic activity. The evidence presented in this paper indicates that debt management actions of a magnitude comparable to the recent changes in U. S. debt management policy have sizeable effects both in the financial markets and more broadly. In particular, a shift from long-term to short-term government debt - that is, a shift opposite to the Treasury's recent policy - lowers yields on long-term assets, raises yields on short-term assets, and in the short run stimulates output and spending. Moreover, the stimulus to spending is disproportionately concentrated in fixed investment, so that debt management actions shortening the maturity of the government debt not only increase the economy's output but also shift the composition of output toward increased capital formation. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{argue that}} time {{variation}} in the maturity of corporate debt arises because firms behave as macro liquidity providers, absorbing the supply shocks associated with changes in the maturity structure of government debt. We document that when the government funds itself with more short-term debt, firms fill the resulting gap by issuing more long-term debt, and vice versa. This type of liquidity provision is undertaken more aggressively: (1) when the ratio of government debt to total debt is higher and (2) by firms with stronger balance sheets. Our theory sheds new light on market timing phenomena in corporate finance more generally. THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL year-to-year {{variation in the}} <b>average</b> <b>maturity</b> of corporate debt issues. For example, using Flow of Funds data from the Federal Reserve, which cover all forms of borrowing, including both public and private, we estimate that in 1999, 24. 7 % of nonfinancial corporate debt issues were “long term”—defined as having a <b>maturity</b> of 1 <b>year</b> or more.

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{analysis}} was performed on habitat-related factors for the southeastern side of Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia to investigate the continued absence of moose (Alces alces) from the region. Temperature and snow depth, at times, reach levels that could cause thermal stress or impede movement of moose; however, {{it is unlikely that}} these factors dictate the absence of moose. No clear relation-ships were established between environmental concentration levels of the heavy metals molybdenum, cadmium, copper, and lead and moose distribution; however, high concentration levels of molybdenum in the Cape Breton study area warrant further investigation. Road density assessments showed that the study area has a higher level of road density compared to 2 mainland control sites; however, higher road density occurs in other areas in which moose persist. Anthropogenic factors such as poaching were not considered influential enough to exclude moose. A forest habitat comparison {{analysis was}} performed to identify habitat features that were statistically correlated with moose presence, and then were applied in a probability model to predict moose presence in the study area. The logistic regression model used to predict the probability of moose presence was composed of positively associated forest inventory variables (softwood <b>average</b> <b>maturity,</b> hardwood <b>average</b> <b>maturity,</b> % mixed hardwood, % non-forested area, total wetland area) that best fit the data.
