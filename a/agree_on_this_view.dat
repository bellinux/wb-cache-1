40|$|It {{is argued}} that the meaning of inevitability and {{contingency}} depends on the position someone has in the realism/constructivism debate. Furthermore, it {{is argued that}} analyzing what we mean by inevitable versus contingent knowledge adds a new dimension to the realism/constructivism debate. Scientific realist and social constructivist views of science often lead to, respectively, too high expectations and too low confidence in what science can do. This controversy is not always productive for scientific practices that work in the context of practical applications (e. g., the engineering sciences). The aim {{of this paper is to}} make a contribution to a more viable view of those scientific practices. The approach taken is to construe two philosophical stances within which the meaning of inevitability and contingency is examined. The first stance is called metaphysical realism. It is construed such that it fits Hacking’s (2000) ideas on the inevitability of scientific knowledge. The second stance is called epistemological constructivism. The two stances agree that there is an independent world which sets limits to our knowledge, but they disagree on whether we must assume the existence of a pre-given, or even, knowable structure in the world. The dissonance between the two stances is reduced such that just one significant epistemological issue remains, namely, which part(s) of science are inevitable? Next, the contingency of science is interpreted in terms of Giere’s (2006) notion of scientific perspectivism. This view emphasizes the role of (different kinds of) instruments in providing epistemic access to the world – which is why we cannot attain mirror-like knowledge of the world. Both stances <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>view.</b> Yet, when considering the apparent presuppositions of perspectivism an additional epistemological issue arises, namely, whether a clear distinction can be made between the object and representations (i. e., perspectives) of that object. In order to be more faithful to concrete scientific practice, it is proposed to consider (different kinds of) instruments as interfaces rather than perspectives on something. In the epistemological constructivist stance, interfaces transform material or symbolic or electronic or whatever input, which cannot be directly perceived or known by us, to output that can be perceived, experienced and/or conceived (e. g., numbers, tables, graphs). Finally, the materiality of (different kinds of) instruments is crucial for explaining which parts of science are inevitabl...|$|E
40|$|Institutional {{freedom is}} {{considered}} one of the most important factor in the debate of economic growth of nations. Most prominent kinds of institutional freedom which actively take part in economic prosperity are democracy (political liberalization) and economic freedom (business liberalization). In the history of economic growth savings and investment issues have their unique importance. More or less economists of all schools of thought <b>agreed</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> point of <b>view</b> that savings and investment directly and indirectly play vital role in economic growth of nations. This study presents the overview that either both democracy and economic freedom are really important factors for national savings and investment in Pakistan. For empirical investigation this study measured the indexes of level of economic freedom and democracy on annual basis. “Alliance for Restoration of Democracy in Asia” (ARDA) and “The Fraser Institute Canada” methodologies are adopted for measurement of democracy and economic freedom in Pakistan respectively. For study period 1970 to 2007 this study constructed the data set of 38 annual observations. The most recent econometric technique ARDL approach is employed for examination of long run and short run relationships between targeted variables. On empirically grounds it is divulged that during study period democracy in Pakistan did not contribute remarkably toward national saving and investment proxies. According to results, democracy affected the national savings and investment in Pakistan positively but insignificantly. Economic freedom the other core explanatory variable is considered more conducive for investment while it hampered the national savings remarkably in Pakistan during study period...|$|R
