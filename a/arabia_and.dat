5|$|Saudis and Jordanians {{provided}} an active {{support to the}} royalists through {{the first years of}} war. The September 1962 coup d'état in Yemen was perceived a threat to the monarchies in both Saudi <b>Arabia</b> <b>and</b> Jordan, prompting shipments of weapons to the royalists, beginning October 1. The support to the monarchists was quickly countered by the Egyptian aid to the Republicans, rapidly spiraling the country into a full-scale war, as the Republicans called for general mobilization and the Egyptians dispatching troops. On November 4, with the war expanding across North Yemen, the Mecca Radio reported of Egyptian air force attacks on Saudi villages. The same day, a military alliance of Saudi <b>Arabia</b> <b>and</b> Jordan became widely known. Following the Egyptian raids on Saudi <b>Arabia</b> <b>and</b> the official Joint Defense Pact formed between Egypt and the Republicans, the Saudis decided to launch attacks on the Republicans in North Yemen.|$|E
