500|$|... "Much Apu About Nothing" [...] {{was written}} by David S. Cohen and {{directed}} by Susie Dietter. Joe Mantegna guest stars in the episode as Fat Tony. Much of {{the inspiration for the}} episode came from news reports of bears roaming streets in Southern California around the time when the episode was in production. Cohen said that when a bear swims in somebody's pool or goes in somebody's garbage can, it becomes a popular news item in California. The show runner of The Simpsons at the time, Bill Oakley, commented that the news reports often create an anti-bear hysteria, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the inspirations for the episode.|$|E

2500|$|Early {{reception}} {{for the movie}} was mostly mixed. The Times of India gave 3 out of 5 stars saying that,"Emraan Hashmi & Kangana bring the Gangster magic again....they have {{done a good job}} whereas Adhyayan Suman shows promise." [...] Bollywood Hungama gave a good review saying [...] "On the whole, Raaz – The Mystery Continues is rich in the horror quotient <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> its major USPs, besides the highly competent performances by its principal cast and a lilting musical score. At the box-office, this one will continue the winning streak of Mahesh Bhatt and Mukesh Bhatt's Vishesh Films. The 4-day weekend [...] will only cement its status further. Go for it!". The lead actors were praised for their performance. In the review, [...] "On the acting front, both Emraan and Kangana vie for top honours. Emraan is excellent. He conveys a lot through facial expressions and that's the sign of a proficient actor. He's just getting better and better with every film. Kangana is top notch. After Fashion, this one's another power-packed performance from the actress. Adhyayan Suman is super-confident and registers a strong impact, especially towards the climax. He shows promise. Jackie Shroff is quite okay in a brief role." [...] NDTV gave negative reviews for the movie saying [...] "The first Raaz, which married the Hollywood film What Lies Beneath with the myth of Savitri who pursued Yamraj until her husband came back to life, had a cheesy appeal. This Raaz is a big bore. The scares are tired and Suri doesn't know how to pace them out. So, every minute, something awful is happening, from a bull attack to mutilation and murder. Was I scared? Not once. This mystery was better left discontinued." [...] AOL reviewer Noyon Jyoti Parasara too rated the film low. He gave the film a mere 2 out of 5 and said, [...] "Raaz – The Mystery Continues, which with all its hype was supposed scare the lights out of you, could not make me bat an eyelid out of fear. So there go all expectations!." ...|$|E

50|$|All {{throughout}} the years Talal El Merhebi continued his work and was a friend and loved by everyone, due to his kind, helpful, and supporting personality. According to Talal corruption was unjustified and he tried his best to fight corruption in the political class <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of his most important priorities, that's why he didn't abuse his power to make money while others were. It's true {{he came from a}} wealthy family, but he was a supporter of an anti-corruption cause.|$|R

In 1952 Sturm sold the property to Ralph Bunche and his wife, who were raising three children; the couple used the award money that came with the Nobel Prize to buy the house. He lived in the house until his death in 1971, and his wife lived there until she died in 1988.|$|R
60|$|They grind {{them first}} in a mill. Then they mix them with sulphuric acid and water, and that melts them down, and parts them into two things. One is {{sulphate}} of lime (gypsum, as it is commonly called), and which will not dissolve in water, and is of little use. But the other is what is called superphosphate of lime, which will dissolve in water; so that {{the roots of the}} plants can suck it up: <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the richest of manures.|$|E

It has been my personal benefactor, and I worship it accordingly--at a distance. By the way, talking of marriage reminds me of its legitimate fruits. Bellamy tells me that your daughter Angela (if I had a daughter, I should call her Diabola, it is more appropriate for a woman) has grown uncommonly handsome. Bring her to see me; I adore beauty in all its forms, especially its female form. Is she really so handsome?" ...|$|E

I {{do not think that}} this town is to be taken by storm, and I doubt whether Lord Lake will be content to wait for regular siege operations, before he tries an assault.|$|E

[...] <b>And</b> <b>that's</b> what this episode <b>is</b> about. No <b>one</b> {{has the right to}} force anyone to believe the things that they believe. That's one of the beautiful things about Gene Roddenberry's vision of IDIC (Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations), <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> {{of the things that we}} really wanted to hammer home here. Sisko does everything he can not to impose his values on the Bajorans, but Vedek Winn is determined to impose her values on everyone.|$|R
60|$|Indeed, {{it looked}} a little as though the round uncle were cutting {{magazine}} pages against time. Manuel's body, cramped over from the hips, stayed like a statue; but his long arms grabbed the fish without ceasing. Little Penn toiled valiantly, but {{it was easy to}} see he was weak. Once or twice Manuel found time to help him without breaking the chain of supplies, and once Manuel howled because he had caught his finger in a Frenchman's hook. These hooks are made of soft metal, to be rebent after use; but the cod very often get away with them and are hooked again elsewhere; <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the many reasons why the Gloucester boats despise the Frenchmen.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Baas," [...] {{said the}} dwarf, {{speaking}} for the first time, [...] "I have heard the tale, and as for being clever, perhaps I am and perhaps I am not. My people said that I was clever, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the reasons why {{they would not have}} me for a chief. If I had been clever only, they could have borne it, they said, or if I had been ugly only, but being both ugly and clever I was no chief for them. They feared lest I should rule them too well and make all the people to be born ugly also. Ah! they were fools; they did not understand that it wants someone cleverer than I to make people so ugly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{the reasons}} why I did not {{suggest that you should}} {{accompany}} me.

I wished to face the thing alone, but that good fellow Savage says that he will go where I go, leaving you and Hans here to make further attempts if we do not return. Our plan is to slip out of the town during the night, wearing white dresses like the Kendah, of which I have bought some for tobacco, and make the best of our way up the slope by starlight that is very bright now. When dawn comes we will try to find the road through that precipice, or over it, and for the rest trust to Providence." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 15, 16. Ay, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the {{pigments}} {{with which}} I {{am trying to}} draw the character of Prestongrange. 'Tis a most curious thing to render that kind, insignificant mask. To make anything precise is to risk my effect. And till the day he died, Davie was never sure of what P. was after. Not only so; very often P. didn't know himself. There was an element of mere liking for Davie; there was an element of being determined, in case of accidents, to keep well with him. He hoped his Barbara would bring him to her feet, besides, and make him manageable. That was why he sent him to Hope Park with them. But Davie cannot know; I give you the inside of Davie, and my method condemns me to give only the outside both of Prestongrange and his policy.|$|E
60|$|So we trekked {{with the}} moon, Gaasha guiding us, {{and did not}} outspan till dawn. As I have said, we had no horses, but never until I made that journey did it come home to me how slow are oxen, for never before then was I in a hurry, nor, indeed, have I been since that time. It is the Englishmen who are always in a hurry, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{the reasons why we}} Boers are so {{superior}} to them, and when we choose can master them in everything, except shopkeeping, and especially in fighting. Well, at the best the cattle could not drag the waggon over the roadless veldt at a greater rate than two miles an hour, or cover more than twenty miles a day in all. It was pitiful to see Ralph's impatience; again and again he walked on and returned; indeed, had we allowed it, I think that he would have pressed forward on foot, leaving us to follow in the waggon.|$|E
60|$|Up to {{this year}} Mowgli had always delighted in {{the turn of the}} seasons. It was he who {{generally}} saw the first Eye-of-the-Spring deep down among the grasses, and the first bank of spring clouds, which are like nothing else in the Jungle. His voice could be heard in all sorts of wet, star-lighted, blossoming places, helping the big frogs through their choruses, or mocking the little upside-down owls that hoot through the white nights. Like all his people, spring was the season he chose for his flittings--moving, for the mere joy of rushing through the warm air, thirty, forty, or fifty miles between twilight and the morning star, and coming back panting and laughing and wreathed with strange flowers. The Four did not follow him on these wild ringings of the Jungle, but went off to sing songs with other wolves. The Jungle People are very busy in the spring, and Mowgli could hear them grunting and screaming and whistling according to their kind. Their voices then are different from their voices at other times of the year, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the reasons why spring in the Jungle is called the Time of New Talk.|$|E
500|$|Armagh manager Joe Kernan {{claimed he}} would have {{resigned}} had his side won but defeat encouraged him to continue. He lauded his players for their effort nonetheless, saying: [...] "..we've won an All-Ireland, and {{got back to the}} final. I think that's a phenomenal achievement." [...] He added <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> confident Armagh would win another title in the future. Of the match itself, Kernan said: [...] "I think if Steven McDonnell had got that goal towards the end, even with the man down I think we would have won the game. Big matches hinge on certain things <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of them."
