2500|$|In {{a journal}} entry {{written in the}} 1970s, Oates sarcastically {{addressed}} her critics, writing, [...] "So many books! so many! Obviously JCO has a full career behind her, if one chooses {{to look at it}} that way; many more titles and she might as well... what?...give up all hopes for a 'reputation'? [...] but I work hard, and long, and as the hours roll by I seem to create more than I anticipate; more, certainly, than the literary world allows for a 'serious' writer. Yet I have more stories to tell, and more novels [...] ". In The New York Review of Books in 2007, Michael Dirda suggested that disparaging criticism of Oates [...] "derives from reviewer's angst: How does one judge <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>by</b> Oates when one is not familiar with most of the backlist?

2500|$|In 1977 Gradishar {{assisted}} the Broncos to Super Bowl XII, their very first. He earned Pro Bowl honors {{and was named}} first team All-Pro. Gradishar anchored a defense that led the AFC in fewest points allowed (148 in the 14-game season) and gave up the 6th fewest yards. Gradishar was also voted the AFC Defensive Player of the Year by the Columbus Touchdown Club. The 1977 Broncos season is documented in <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>by</b> Terry Frei, 77: Denver, the Broncos, and a Coming of Age that features Gradishar, Lyle Alzado and others. The 1977 Broncos season began with a 7–0 shutout of the St. Louis Cardinals that {{had been one of}} the NFL's top offenses from 1974–1976 that featured offensive stars like Jim Hart, Terry Metcalf, Mel Gray, Dan Dierdorf and Conrad Dobler. In a 14–7 win against the Kansas City Chiefs the Broncos made a goal line stand as time expired to preserve a win. Denver Post staff writer Terry Frei's book, 77: Denver, the Broncos, and a Coming of Age, put it this way, [...] "Gradishar penetrated and stopped two running plays, as Gradishar did time and time again on the goal line in his career. It was the trademark of both Gradishar and the defense overall".|$|E

6000|$|Mark Twain {{that year}} was working pretty {{steadily}} on 'The Yankee at [...] King Arthur's Court', a book {{which he had}} begun two years before. [...] He had published nothing since the Huck Finn story, and his company [...] was {{badly in need of}} <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>by</b> an author of distinction.

He seems to have worked there [...] successfully, though what improvement of conditions he found in that [...] numerous, lively household, over those at home it would be difficult [...] to say.|$|E

On 26 June, almost five months later, Wiley quietly offered, as we know from a notice in The Patriot, a New York newspaper, [...] "Tales for Fifteen, or Imagination and Heart, an original work in one volume, by Jane Morgan, price 75c." [...] The actual author {{was the author of}} The Spy; and the two stories, [...] "Imagination" [...] and [...] "Heart," [...] were obviously imitations of Mrs. Amelia Opie's popular moral tales, published, as the paper cover noted, when The Spy was in its fourth edition, The Pioneers in its third, and The Pilot in press. The sale was so small that only four copies are known to be extant. Why, one may ask, did James Cooper, who was in 1823 a writer of national and international reputation, publish this volume of imitative stories for adolescent girls, even though his identity was carefully concealed? ...|$|E
