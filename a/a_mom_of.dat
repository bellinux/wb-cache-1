40|$|Variations in postverbal {{constituent}} ordering {{have been}} attributed to both grammatical complexity (heaviness) and discourse status (newness), although few studies compare the two factors explicitly. Through corpus analysis and experimentation, we demonstrate that both factors simultaneously and independently influence word order in two English constructions. While past investigations of these factors have focused on their effects in language comprehension, we argue that postponing heavy and new constituents facilitates processes of planning and production. * Even relatively fixed-word-order languages like English permit certain phrases to occur in more than one order. Examples 1 – 3 illustrate three familiar alternations in the sequencing of postverbal constituents. (1) Heavy NP Shift 1 (HNPS) a. The waiter brought the wine we had ordered to the table. b.

40|$|Background ADAM 12 is a placenta-derived {{glycoprotein}} that {{is involved}} in growth and differentiation. The maternal serum concentration of ADAM 12 is a potential first-trimester maternal serum marker of Down syndrome (DS). Here we examine the potential of ADAM 12 as a second-trimester maternal serum marker of DS. Materials and Methods The concentration of ADAM 12 was determined in gestational week 14 – 19 in 88 DS pregnancies and 341 matched control pregnancies. Medians of normal pregnancies were established by polynomial regression and the distribution <b>of</b> log 10 <b>MoM</b> ADAM 12 values in DS pregnancies and controls determined. Correlations with alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and free β-human chorionic gonadotrophin (free β-hCG) were established and used to model the performance of maternal serum screening with ADAM 12 {{in combination with other}} second-trimester serum markers. Results The ADAM 12 maternal serum concentration was significantly increased with <b>a</b> median <b>MoM</b> <b>of</b> 1. 85 and a mean log 10 <b>MoM</b> (SD) <b>of</b> 0. 268 (0. 2678) compared to a mean log 10 <b>MoM</b> (SD) <b>of</b> 0. 013 (0. 4318) in controls. ADAM 12 correlated with maternal weight and ethnicity (with the serum concentration increased in Afro-Caribbeans), but neither with maternal age nor gestational age, and only marginally with AFP (r(DS) = 0. 078, r(controls) = 0. 093) and free β-hCG (r(DS) = 0. 073, r(controls) = 0. 144.

40|$|A new set {{of entire}} domain basis {{functions}} has been recently proposed in the literature for analyzing microstrip antennas with convex polygonal patches through <b>a</b> Method <b>of</b> Moment (<b>MoM)</b> numerical procedure.

40|$|The knowledge, {{prior to}} system operations, of which program modules are {{problematic}} is valuable to a {{software quality assurance}} team, especially {{when there is a}} constraint on software quality enhancement resources. A cost-effective approach for allocating such resources is to obtain a prediction {{in the form of a}} quality-based ranking of program modules. Subsequently, <b>a</b> module-order model (<b>MOM)</b> is used to gauge the performance of the predicted rankings. From a practical software engineering point of view, multiple software quality objectives may be desired by <b>a</b> <b>MOM</b> for the system under consideration: e. g., the desired rankings may be such that 100 % of the faults should be detected if the top 50 % of modules with highest number of faults are subjected to quality improvements. Moreover, the management team for the same system may also desire that 80 % of the faults should be accounted if the top 20 % of the modules are targeted for improvement. Existing work related to <b>MOM(s)</b> use <b>a</b> quantitative prediction model to obtain the predicted rankings of-program modules, implying that only the fault prediction error measures such as the average, relative, or mean square errors are minimized. Such an approach does not provide a direct insight into the performance behavior <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>MOM.</b> For <b>a</b> given percentage of modules enhanced, the performance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>MOM</b> is gauged by how many faults are accounted for by the predicted ranking as compared with the perfect ranking. We propose an approach for calibrating <b>a</b> multiobjective <b>MOM</b> using genetic programming. Other estimation techniques, e. g., multiple linear regression and neural networks cannot achieve multiobjective optimization for MOM(s). The proposed methodology facilitates the simultaneous optimization of multiple performance objectives for <b>a</b> <b>MOM.</b> Case studies <b>of</b> two industrial software systems are presented, the empirical results of which demonstrate a new promise for goal-oriented software quality modeling...|$|R
