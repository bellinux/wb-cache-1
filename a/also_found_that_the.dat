5|$|Investigators <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> deicing {{procedures}} at LaGuardia were substandard. While the jet {{encountered a}} delay {{of up to}} 35 minutes, {{they found that the}} deicing fluid that was being used at the airport, and by the majority of commercial airlines across the United States, was effective for only fifteen minutes. The accident led to a number of studies into the effect that ice has on aircraft, and several recommendations into prevention techniques.|$|E

He <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fast tissues which had been dropped in the 1930s would control decompression in some cases, so he re-introduced the fast compartments to the model, and added an extra slower compartment to better model long-duration dives.|$|E
5|$|A 2017 {{histological}} {{study of}} growth lines {{found that the}} Portuguese Baryonyx specimen had died between the age of 23 and 25 years old, and was close to its maximum size and skeletal maturity. This contradicted a younger age indicated by the neurocentral sutures not being fused, {{and the presence of}} both mature and sub-adult traits may be due to paedomorphosis (where juvenile traits are retained into adulthood). Paedomorphic traits may be related to swimming locomotion, as they have been suggested in other extinct animals thought to have been aquatic (such as plesiosaurs and temnospondyls). The study <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> animal had reached sexual maturity at the age of 13 to 15 years, due to a decrease in growth rate at this point.|$|E

Asch suggested that this procedure created a doubt in the participants' mind about the seemingly obvious answer. Participants reported that the correct but rejected line was almost but not quite equal to the standard line. Asch <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> effectiveness of the group pressure increased significantly from 1 person to 3 people unanimously responding incorrectly.

5|$|Controversy over Kampoeng Rawa had {{developed}} by late 2012, when the Water Resource Management Agency {{declared that the}} site was illegally located in the green belt around Lake Rawa Pening. In 2013, the ecologist Sudharto of Diponegoro University stated that the area around Rawa Pening had to be clear of all buildings, otherwise the water flow and ecosystem would be disturbed. It was <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> permits for the establishment had not been obtained. However, the Regent of Semarang, Sudharto, was supportive of Kampoeng Rawa, stating that the complex not only improved {{the welfare of the}} farmers and fishermen, but stopped feuds over the use of rice paddies in the area.|$|E
5|$|During its review, Sandia {{determined}} that a significant overram of the powder bags into the gun had occurred as it was being loaded and that the overram could have caused the explosion. A subsequent test by the Navy of the overram scenario confirmed that an overram could have caused {{an explosion in the}} gun breech.

5|$|Given {{that element}} 120 fills the 2f5/2 proton orbital, much {{attention}} has been given to the compound nucleus 302Ubn and its properties. Several experiments have been performed between 2000 and 2008 at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions in Dubna studying the fission characteristics of the compound nucleus 302Ubn. Two nuclear reactions have been used, namely 244Pu+58Fe and 238U+64Ni. The results have revealed how nuclei such as this fission predominantly by expelling closed shell nuclei such as 132Sn (Z=50, N=82). It was <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> yield for the fusion-fission pathway was similar between 48Ca and 58Fe projectiles, indicating a possible future use of 58Fe projectiles in superheavy element formation.|$|E

He was angered when the club sold Jackie Sewell to Sheffield Wednesday in March 1951 – breaking Lawton's own transfer record in the process – as he felt the move showed a lack of ambition from the club's directors. He <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> well paid job he was promised outside of football did not transpire. His tally of nine goals in 31 games in 1950–51 and 13 goals in 31 games in 1951–52 was disappointing, and he was made available for transfer.|$|E
5|$|In February 2015, at the {{conclusion}} of the Croatia–Serbia genocide case, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) dismissed a Serbian lawsuit which alleged that Operation Storm constituted genocide, ruling that Croatia did not have the specific intent to exterminate the country's Serb minority, though it reaffirmed that serious crimes against Serb civilians had taken place. The court <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> HV left accessible escape routes for civilians. According to the judgement, Serb civilians fleeing their homes, as well as those remaining in UN protected areas, were subject to various forms of harassment by both the HV and Croatian civilians. On 8 August, a refugee column was shelled.|$|E

This would have weakened his heart and made him less able to recover from such an injury, and was thought to be related to his overweight frame and lack of exercise. Modern scholars generally believe that McKinley died of pancreatic necrosis, a condition that is difficult to treat today and would have been completely impossible for the doctors of his time.|$|E
5|$|Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow {{looked for}} effects with {{significant}} years. They asked 83 undergraduate students to rate, {{on a scale}} from 1 to 7, how much they liked the years between 1976 and 2001, the months of the year, the seasons, times of day, and even types of pet in an attempt to disguise the aim of the study. Analysis of the data showed that participants liked the year of their birth much more than the average of the four years after they were born. The researchers <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> year of high school graduation was also liked better than average. Of the months of the year, the most liked month was the one in which the participants were born.|$|E

5|$|A 2010 {{study of}} the stream found that the Fonteyn Kill's {{specific}} conductance, {{a measure of the}} amount of dissolved road salt in the stream's water, was nearly 1.0 mS/cm, higher than any value recorded in the Casperkill. Sites upstream of Vassar Lake were recorded in a separate study as having specific conductances twice as high as locations downstream of the lake, suggesting a regulating effect caused by water mixing and retention in Vassar Lake. The total inorganic nitrogen in the kill, which is usually correlated with surrounding green cover, was about , average for measurements taken in the Fonteyn Kill and Casperkill in that study. The study <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Fonteyn Kill's score on the Hilsenhoff family biotic index (HBI), a scale measuring pollution based on the tolerance of endemic benthic macroinvertebrates, was approximately six, indicating fairly poor water quality, with scores {{for the rest of the}} Casperkill–Fonteyn Kill watershed were as high as seven (poor water quality) to as low as four (very good water quality).|$|E
