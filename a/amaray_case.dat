50|$|In Bulgaria, Volumes 1 and 2 were {{released}} in early 2006. Each disc was sold separately in an <b>amaray</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{recording}} {{took place}} at the Zénith de Paris during the shows played on 23 and 24 March. It has the complete setlist. It was released by Warner Music worldwide on 25 November in three editions: CD, DVD, CD+DVD (jewel case and <b>amaray</b> <b>case).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Around 2000, PC game {{packaging}} in Europe {{began to}} converge {{with that of}} PS2 (and later, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube) console games, in the keep case format in which to this day {{the vast majority of}} games are sold. These boxes are sometimes known as <b>Amaray</b> <b>cases,</b> after a popular manufacturer of them. In the US, most PC games continue to ship in cardboard boxes, though the size of such boxes has been standardized to a small form factor. Special packages such as a [...] "Collector's Edition" [...] frequently still ship with oversized boxes, or those with a different material, such as a [...] "Steelbook".|$|R
50|$|The Discbox Slider (also called DBS) is a disc {{packaging}} {{concept in}} 100% carton board, found both in CD and DVD sized packaging formats. The DBS is comparable with plastic jewel or <b>Amaray</b> <b>cases</b> {{when it comes}} to size but holds more of the features of the LP style cases in terms of light weight and printability. The DBS case opens up from the side by moving the slider part (on which the disc is resting) from the sleeve. The Discbox Slider is 100% recyclable. Many covermount CDs released in British magazine Mixmag used to be packaged in Discbox slider, after replacing a standard jewel box, although the discbox slider itself was replaced by a simple cardboard sleeve.|$|R
25|$|Initially, {{the first}} season was offered in volumes, with four episodes per disc. After the success of {{releasing}} seasons 2, 3, and 4 in slimpacks, {{the first season}} was re-released as a seven disc set, requiring new discs to be mastered and printed to include more episodes per disc {{so there would be}} fewer discs in the set. For the complete series box set, the first season would be redone again, this time to six DVDs, retaining all bonus features. The individual volume discs for the first season are still in print, but are rare for lack of shelf space and because the slimpacks are more popular. In 2012, all season sets were reissued in slipcovered clear standard-sized <b>amaray</b> DVD <b>cases,</b> with season 1 being the 6-disc version as opposed to the 7-disc version.|$|R
5000|$|Live Vengeance '82 is a live DVD and UMD of a Judas Priest concert {{recorded}} on 12 December 1982, at the Mid-South Coliseum in Memphis, Tennessee. It {{was released in}} 2006 in both an <b>Amaray</b> <b>case</b> and a limited edition digipak. The first release on DVD had been in 2004 as Disc 5 of the Metalogy compilation box-set, which came in a simple card-sleeve.|$|E
50|$|The case is {{comparable}} with the plastic jewel or <b>amaray</b> <b>case</b> {{when it comes}} to size, but has more of the features of the LP style cases in terms of weight and printability. The DBS case opens up from the side by moving the slider part (on which the disc is resting) from the sleeve. The Discbox Slider is also considered as an environmentally friendly prerecorded media packaging option as it is 100% recyclable and manufactured using sustainable processes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} 2002 DVD {{release was}} packaged as a [...] "special edition". In {{addition to the}} extra features on the disc, the <b>Amaray</b> <b>case</b> came in a foil-embossed cardboard sleeve, and inside was an eight-page booklet, featuring a five-page essay by Robertson entitled [...] "The End of a Musical Journey". Also included was a US$5 rebate coupon for the four-CD box set. In 2005, the DVD was re-issued with different artwork and stripped of the outer foil packaging, inner booklet and coupon; the disc's contents remained unchanged.|$|E
5000|$|Appropriate to TISM's humour and {{mockery of}} the music industry, the album is only {{available}} {{as part of a}} larger package containing two DVDs. The first DVD is titled A Film By Antonionioni which is, in fact, not a film but a live concert called [...] "Save Our TISM" [...] featuring, in true TISM style, a fake telethon running behind the band. The second DVD is TISM: A Docunentary (keeping with the 'n' theme) which features lengthy interviews of the band and a history of TISM. Also on the disc is rare or previously-unreleased footage from TISM concerts ranging from their first-ever show through to the present day. The disc also features every TISM video clip including the banned video for [...] "I Might Be a Cunt, but I'm Not a Fucking Cunt". The original (digipak) pressings did not feature the video for [...] "Everyone Else Has Had More Sex Than Me", but it was added when the album was re-released on 10 November 2004 in a standard <b>Amaray</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
