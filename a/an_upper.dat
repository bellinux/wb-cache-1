5|$|Peridioles {{are often}} {{attached}} to the fruiting body by a funiculus, a structure of hyphae that is differentiated into three regions: the basal piece, which attaches it to the inner wall of the peridium, the middle piece, and <b>an</b> <b>upper</b> sheath, called the purse, connected to the lower surface of the peridiole. Inside the purse and middle piece is a coiled thread of interwoven hyphae called the funicular cord, attached at {{one end to the}} peridiole and at the other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called the hapteron. C.olla has a wide purse with <b>an</b> <b>upper</b> portion not easily distinguishable from the lower part.|$|E

5|$|Bishop Kidder {{was killed}} during the Great Storm of 1703, when two chimney stacks in the palace fell on him and his wife, while they were asleep in bed.

5|$|Forecasters {{initially}} predicted {{wind shear}} from <b>an</b> <b>upper</b> level low would prevent strengthening and cause dissipation within three days. However, the depression continued to organize as deep convection continued to develop near the circulation despite moderate amounts of wind shear, {{and the system}} intensified into Tropical Storm Chris six hours after developing. The convection gradually consolidated over the system, and by late on the 1st Chris reached winds of 60mph (95km/h) while passing 50miles (80km) north of the northern Leeward Islands. The structure of Chris continued to improve and become more symmetrical, and <b>an</b> <b>upper</b> level eye feature developed early on August 2. Outflow improved in all quadrants, as well, and the storm reached a peak intensity of 65mph (100km/h) shortly thereafter while located 120miles (195km) east of St. Thomas. Despite initial predictions of Chris intensifying to a hurricane as a ridge of high pressure forced it west-northwestward, upper level shear dissipated the well-defined inner core of the storm, and Chris started to weaken.|$|E
5|$|Frequently, two Eye-related goddesses appear together, {{representing}} {{different aspects}} of the Eye. The juxtaposed deities often stand for the procreative and aggressive sides of the Eye's character, as Hathor and Sekhmet sometimes do. Wadjet and Nekhbet can stand for Lower and Upper Egypt, respectively, along with the Red Crown and White Crown that represent the two lands. Similarly, Mut, whose main cult center was in Thebes, sometimes served as <b>an</b> <b>Upper</b> Egyptian counterpart of Sekhmet, who was worshipped in Memphis in Lower Egypt.|$|E

5|$|HSP occurs {{more often}} in {{children}} than in adults, and usually follows <b>an</b> <b>upper</b> respiratory tract infection.

The incidence of HSP in children is about 20 per 100,000 children per year, making it the most common vasculitis in children.|$|E
5|$|Helmets made {{entirely of}} bronze were also used, {{while some of}} them had large cheek guards, {{probably}} stitched or riveted to the helmet, as well as <b>an</b> <b>upper</b> pierced knot to hold a crest. Small holes all around the cheek guards and the helmet's lower edge were used for the attachment of internal padding. Other types of bronze helmets were also used. During the late Mycenaean period, additional types were also used such as horned helmets made of strips of leather.|$|E

The game {{would have gone}} to a shootout, but under the first usage of the AHL's new video replay system at Giant Center, a Senators goal that had been overturned with 6.5 seconds left {{in overtime}} was restored. The Bears were held to a single goal in a second straight game in a 3–1 loss to Connecticut Whale on October 26, but the next day saw their first home win and first shutout victory of the season. They defeated the Albany Devils 3–0 and Holtby, who had been sidelined since the previous week by <b>an</b> <b>upper</b> body injury, made 35 saves. Forward T.J. Syner was recalled from the ECHL's Reading Royals and made his Hershey debut in that game. The Bears finished the month with a 3–2 victory against the Penguins on October 28, marking their first winning streak of the season.
