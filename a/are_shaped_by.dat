5|$|During the Mesozoic, the prototypical mammal {{was a small}} nocturnal {{insectivore}} {{something like}} a tree shrew. Due to their nocturnal habits, most mammals lost their color vision, and greatly improved their sense of hearing. All mammals of today <b>are</b> <b>shaped</b> <b>by</b> this origin.

5|$|Gyeongju's {{drainage}} patterns <b>are</b> <b>shaped</b> <b>by</b> {{these lines}} of mountains. The Dongdae Mountains divide a narrow foothills area on their east, and various internal river systems to the west. Most of the city's interior is drained {{by the small}} Hyeongsan River, which flows north from Ulsan and meets the sea at Pohang Harbor. The Hyeongsan's chief tributaries include the Bukcheon and Namcheon, which join it in Gyeongju Basin.|$|E
5|$|Interplanetary space {{contains}} {{the magnetic field}} generated by the Sun. There are also magnetospheres generated by planets such as Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury and the Earth that have their own magnetic fields. These <b>are</b> <b>shaped</b> <b>by</b> {{the influence of the}} solar wind into the approximation of a teardrop shape, with the long tail extending outward behind the planet. These magnetic fields can trap particles from the solar wind and other sources, creating belts of magnetic particles such as the Van Allen radiation belt. Planets without magnetic fields, such as Mars, have their atmospheres gradually eroded by the solar wind.|$|E

5|$|The {{point at}} which the Solar System ends and {{interstellar}} space begins is not precisely defined because its outer boundaries <b>are</b> <b>shaped</b> <b>by</b> two separate forces: the solar wind and the Sun's gravity. The limit of the solar wind's influence is roughly four times Pluto's distance from the Sun; this heliopause, the outer boundary of the heliosphere, is considered the beginning of the interstellar medium. The Sun's Hill sphere, the effective range of its gravitational dominance, is thought to extend up to a thousand times farther and encompasses the theorized Oort cloud.|$|E

25|$|Entering {{into a long}} {{philosophical}} {{tradition of}} inquiry into human nature, Unger begins by categorically rejecting {{the idea of a}} natural order to the world or a natural state of human organization. For Unger, there are no natural laws. Rather, he takes to the hilt the modernist thesis that we <b>are</b> <b>shaped</b> <b>by</b> context but not bound by context. As such, we have the power to work both within and beyond any constraints of social or cultural binds.|$|E
25|$|The Bay of Fundy is {{also home}} to another {{interesting}} geologic feature, the Hopewell Rocks formation. This formation is where the “famous flower-pot rocks” are located on a short, one kilometer long portion of Shepody Bay. These rocks <b>are</b> <b>shaped</b> <b>by</b> the tides, the strength of the rocks, and the presence of the joints in the rocks. The rock in the cliffs the stacks are being cut from are arkosic sandstone and coarse poorly sorted conglomerates. The tides that are eroding away the cliffs are between 10.7 meters and 14.7 meters high on average.|$|E

25|$|Steel blades are {{commonly}} shaped by forging or stock removal. Forged blades {{are made by}} heating {{a single piece of}} steel, then shaping the metal while hot using a hammer or press. Stock removal blades <b>are</b> <b>shaped</b> <b>by</b> grinding and removing metal. With both methods, after shaping, the steel must be heat treated. This involves heating the steel above its critical point, then quenching the blade to harden it. After hardening, the blade is tempered to remove stresses and make the blade tougher. Mass manufactured kitchen cutlery uses both the forging and stock removal processes. Forging tends to be reserved for manufacturers' more expensive product lines, and can often be distinguished from stock removal product lines by the presence of an integral bolster, though integral bolsters can be crafted through either shaping method.|$|E
25|$|Stone {{sculpture}} is {{an ancient}} activity where pieces of rough natural stone <b>are</b> <b>shaped</b> <b>by</b> the controlled removal of stone. Owing to the permanence of the material, evidence can be found that even the earliest societies indulged {{in some form of}} stone work, though not all areas of the world have such abundance of good stone for carving as Egypt, Greece, India and most of Europe. Petroglyphs (also called rock engravings) are perhaps the earliest form: images created by removing part of a rock surface which remains in situ, by incising, pecking, carving, and abrading. Monumental sculpture covers large works, and architectural sculpture, which is attached to buildings. Hardstone carving is the carving for artistic purposes of semi-precious stones such as jade, agate, onyx, rock crystal, sard or carnelian, and a general term for an object made in this way. Alabaster or mineral gypsum is a soft mineral that is easy to carve for smaller works and still relatively durable. Engraved gems are small carved gems, including cameos, originally used as seal rings.|$|E
25|$|Inhabited by Native Americans for {{thousands}} of years before European exploration, Nuevo México was colonized by the Spanish in 1598 as part of the Imperial Spanish viceroyalty of New Spain. Later, it was part of independent Mexico for a short period before becoming a U.S. territory and eventually a U.S. state {{as a result of the}} Mexican–American War. Among U.S. states, New Mexico has the highest percentage of Hispanics, including mostly descendants of the original Spanish colonists who have lived in the area for more than 400 years beginning in 1598. It has the second-highest percentage of Native Americans as a proportion of the population after Alaska, and the fourth-highest number of Native Americans after California, Oklahoma, and Arizona. The major Native American nations in the state are Navajo, Pueblo, and Apache peoples. The state's demography and culture <b>are</b> <b>shaped</b> <b>by</b> these strong Hispanic and Native American influences and expressed in the state flag. Its scarlet and gold colors come from the royal standards of Spain, along with the ancient sun symbol of the Zia, a Pueblo-related tribe.|$|E
