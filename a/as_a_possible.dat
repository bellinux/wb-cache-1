5|$|Various {{candidates}} were put forward <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> wife for Ernest. His own father {{wanted him to}} look high-up for a wife, such as a Russian grand duchess. One possibility was Princess Clémentine of Orléans, a daughter of Louis Philippe I, whom he met while visiting the court at the Tuileries. Such a marriage would have required his conversion from Lutheranism to Roman Catholicism however, and consequently nothing came of it. She later married his cousin Prince August of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Ernest was also considered by Dowager Queen Maria Christina <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> husband for her young daughter Isabella II of Spain, and by Queen Victoria for her cousin Princess Augusta of Cambridge.|$|E
5|$|After {{his term}} as governor, Brown again {{returned}} to his legal practice in Louisville. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the House of Representatives in 1896, losing to Republican Walter Evans.

Prior to the 1899 Democratic nominating convention, Brown was mentioned <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> gubernatorial nominee, but he declined to become a candidate. When the convention began, he was mentioned as a candidate for convention chairman, but he also refused to serve in this capacity.|$|E

5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{regards the}} main influences {{at play in}} the Georgian alphabet, as scholars have debated whether it was inspired more by the Greek alphabet, or by Semitic alphabets such as Aramaic.

Some scholars have also suggested certain pre-Christian Georgian cultural symbols or clan markers <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> inspiration for particular letters.|$|E
5|$|Anticholinergics {{and surgery}} (lesioning of the corticospinal pathway {{or some of}} the basal ganglia structures) were the only {{treatments}} until the arrival of levodopa, which reduced their use dramatically. Levodopa was first synthesized in 1911 by Casimir Funk, but it received little attention until the mid 20th century. It entered clinical practice in 1967 and brought about a revolution in the management of PD. By the late 1980s deep brain stimulation introduced by Alim Louis Benabid and colleagues at Grenoble, France, emerged <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> treatment.|$|E
5|$|As the Browns {{climbed to}} the top of the NFL, {{speculation}} began to mount that Brown might return to the Buckeyes. Wes Felser had resigned as the team's coach, and Brown was seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>possible</b> replacement. But Brown had also alienated many Ohio State alumni by failing to return to the school after World War II and for signing away players including Groza before their college eligibility expired. He interviewed with the university's athletic board on January 27, 1951, but the board unanimously rejected Brown in favor of Woody Hayes, who was unanimously endorsed by the board of trustees.|$|E
