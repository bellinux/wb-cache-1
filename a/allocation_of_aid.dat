However, a 2007 investigation by The Los Angeles Times claimed there are three major unintended consequences with the foundation's <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid.</b> First, sub-Saharan Africa already suffered from a shortage of primary doctors before the arrival of the Gates Foundation, but [...] "by pouring most contributions into the fight against such high-profile killers as AIDS, Gates grantees have increased the demand for specially trained, higher-paid clinicians, diverting staff from basic care" [...] in sub-Saharan Africa. This [...] "brain drain" [...] adds to the existing doctor shortage and pulls away additional trained staff from children and those suffering from other common killers. Second, [...] "the focus on a few diseases has shortchanged basic needs such as nutrition and transportation".

We employ Tobit (and Probit) models and {{make use of}} an exceptionally detailed database that allows an assessment <b>of</b> the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> Swedish <b>aid</b> channelled through NGOs {{in comparison to the}} <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> Swedish official <b>aid.</b> Our analysis provides mixed results. On the one hand, NGOs appear to be altruistic as far as available indicators on political and commercial motivations <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> can tell. On the other hand, needs-based targeting <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> by NGOs turns out to be surprisingly weak. GDP per capita of recipient countries shapes the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> official <b>aid,</b> but not that <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> channelled through NGOs. The headcount of absolute poverty has a significantly positive effect on aid allocation, but its impact is not particularly strong when NGOs are involved. Overall, the Swedish case supports the sceptical view that NGOs are not necessarily superior donors compared to state aid agencies. Copyright 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Collier and Dollar derive a poverty-efficient <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> and compare it with actual aid allocations. They build the poverty-efficient allocation in two stages. First they use new World Bank ratings of 20 different aspects of national policy to establish the current relationship between aid, policies, and growth. Onto that, they add a mapping from growth to poverty reduction, which reflects the level and distribution of income. They compare the effects of using headcount and poverty-gap measures of poverty. They find the actual <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> to be radically different from the poverty-efficient allocation. In the efficient allocation, for a given level of poverty, aid tapers in with policy reform. In the actual allocation, aid tapers out with reform. In the efficient allocation, aid {{is targeted}} disproportionately to countries with severe poverty and adequate policies - the type of country where 74 percent of the world's poor live. In the actual allocation, such countries receive a much smaller share of aid (56 percent) than their share of the world's poor. With the present allocation, aid is effective in sustainably lifting about 30 million people a year out of absolute poverty. With a poverty-efficient allocation, this would increase to about 80 million people. Even with political constraints introduced to keep allocations for India and China constant, poverty reduction would increase to about 60 million. Reallocating aid is politically difficult, but it may be considerably less difficult than quadrupling aid budgets, which is what the authors estimate would be necessary to achieve the same impact on poverty reduction with existing aid allocations.

40|$|This master thesis aims at {{assessing}} the poverty- {{efficiency of the}} current Norwegian aid allocation. Is Norwegian aid allocated {{in a way that}} has the maximum impact on poverty reduction? I use panel regression and a model developed by Collier & Dollar (2002) to construct a poverty- efficient <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> across countries. This is how aid would be allocated if the sole purpose of donors was to maximize poverty reduction. I thereafter compare the optimal allocation to the current <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid,</b> and in particular to the Norwegian allocation, and I find large discrepancies between them. This can partly be ascribed to a large number of recipient countries. In the poverty-efficient allocation only 32 countries are found to be eligible for aid receipts. Concentrating aid to fewer recipients would increase the poverty-efficiency of the current allocation. I also find that the current Norwegian <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> is considerably less in line with the poverty-efficient allocation than that of the average donor, the rank correlations between them are 0. 42 and 0. 63, respectively. I believe that the recent integration of environmental and foreign policy with aid is partly responsible for the results. Brazil is today the largest recipient of Norwegian aid, and the share of the aid budget pertaining to least developed countries is declining. There appears to be a trade-off between allocating aid for poverty reduction and playing {{a leading role in the}} areas of forest preservation and conflict prevention, which are increasingly prioritized sectors in the Norwegian aid budget. Had considerations of future poverty reduction been taken into account in the model, Norwegian aid might have been evaluated as more poverty-efficient than is the case in this analysis.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} EU s <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> {{earmarked}} food <b>aid</b> contributions among the WFP s development projects in different countries. The study is carried out on basis of five hypotheses deduced from a rational actor model and an organisational process model. The discussion of the hypotheses is based on results from regression analyses of the EU s food aid contributions provided to the WFP, in the period 1991 - 96. The study identifies and explains the factors that are fundamental for the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> these earmarked contributions among the various recipient countries. The study proves that the EU allocates significantly more food aid to the recipient countries classified as better off developing countries than to those classified as the most needy ones. The countries received amount <b>of</b> food <b>aid,</b> respectively, reflects the varying costs it takes to ensure proper execution of operations in connection with development projects owing to different circumstances in the host countries. Furthermore, the EU s <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> food <b>aid</b> proves to be a result of a strictly regulated and standardised decision-making process which, consequently, implies that the countries amount <b>of</b> received food <b>aid</b> increases progressively with their respective number of received contributions. In addition, the study proves that the official objective for EU aid policy, to foster the observance of the observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and developing and consolidating democracy and the rule of law, stated under the Maastricht Treaty, 130 u, has no significant effect on the EU s allocation actions among the recipient countries. Neither are constraints formulated as imperatives to avoid a decrease in the European Development Fund found to have any significant effect on the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> food <b>aid.</b> These findings prove to proceed from two core elements of the contribution policy of which the noted factors are reflections. One such main element is the drive for efficiency in the relation to the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> food <b>aid,</b> while the other main element consists of an idealistic and moral justification <b>of</b> the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> such <b>aid.</b> These two main elements do not necessarily oppose each other.

The results suggest the following: Most donors examined also exhibit a bias apparent in bilateral aid allocation in favor of less populous countries.

However, the three United Nations agencies contravene a third bias of bilateral aid allocation and provide more aid to countries geographically more distant from the centers of the Western world. While the regional development banks {{with the possible exception}} of the Inter-American one focus exclusively on economic need as measured by per capita income, the three United Nations agencies also take into account human development need in their aid allocation as measured by the Physical Quality of Life Index. Some tentative evidence is found that respect for political freedom is rewarded with higher aid receipts at the aggregate multilateral level and by the Inter-American Development Bank as well as perhaps, in a few estimations, by two of the three United Nations agencies.
