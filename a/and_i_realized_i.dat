2500|$|Prior to {{the song}}'s release, Lorde teased the song on her Twitter account, saying [...] the [...] "Green Light" [...] would be [...] "different, and kinda unexpected. Complex and funny and sad and joyous and it'll make you DANCE." [...] Lorde {{announced}} {{the release of}} the single and its music video on Twitter on 2 March 2017. Later that day, in a Beats 1 interview with Zane Lowe, she also said: The song is really about those moments kind of immediately after your life changes and about all the silly little things that you gravitate towards. I say, 'She thinks you love the beach, you're such a liar.' What the fuck, she thinks you like the beach?! You don't like the beach! It's those little stupid things. It sounds so happy and then the lyrics are so intense obviously. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> was like, 'how come this thing is coming out so joyous sounding?' And I realized this is that drunk girl at the party dancing around crying about her ex-boyfriend who everyone thinks is a mess. That's her tonight and tomorrow she starts to rebuild.

[...] The band worked on more than a dozen songs, dropping those that were not [...] "working quite well enough". Many of the songs were recorded in a single take, the band playing as a threesome: [...] "You have to understand, as a three-piece, we'd very rarely played together. [...] So [...] I thought, 'Let's see how it goes in the studio.' We worked with an engineer that we'd never worked with before, who was Irish. We did 'Moreover,' and after we were done playing, he came in and said, 'You make a big fookin' noise for three.'" [...] The band felt vindicated.|$|E

5000|$|In 1979, Childs {{performed}} several live {{shows with}} the band Berlin whilst their singer, Terri Nunn, was unavailable. Her first band of note, Toni and the Movers, included Jack Sherman (later {{to become a member}} of the Red Hot Chili Peppers) and Micki Steele (later a member of the Bangles). The Los Angeles-based band performed and toured for two years but did not release an album. In the summer of 1981, after The Movers had disbanded, Childs performed various improvised sets of music at Madame Wong's West and the Madam Wong's clubs in Los Angeles under the name Nadia Kapiche with musicians including Steve Schiff (guitar), Micki Steele (bass), Mark Buchholtz (keyboards/sax), Richard Larsen (keyboards/sax), and drummer Stan Getts. Demo (recording) sessions were also done in Hollywood with most of this band, with Ed Warnecke on drums. Childs was still searching for her niche. She has said, [...] "I didn't know who I was, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> was trying to grab the brass ring like everybody else.

5000|$|By February 1995, Stern had yet {{to approve}} a final script. The studio {{executives}} believed Stern rejected so many drafts {{was because he was}} too afraid to be in a feature film, and so suggested Jeff Goldblum to play as himself. Stern insisted he was not afraid, and felt the idea of someone other than himself playing the role would lead to [...] "the biggest box office bomb in history". Following Avildsen's departure, Stern turned to producer and director Ivan Reitman for his thoughts on the rejected scripts as he thought Reitman [...] "could see if I was being unreasonable". A long time fan of Stern's, Reitman had suggested to Stern that he make a film about his life as early as 1991 and pitched his vision, a biographical film with Stern starring as himself, [...] "almost documentary in feel", as he believed one based on real events from his life, rather than [...] "a fantasy life for him that was silly and salacious", were strong and funny enough for a film. Stern agreed, and subsequently asked Reitman to come on board as producer and help develop a script. Reitman focused on a script that centered more on what Stern was like off the air, and brought in writer Len Blum to help with the task; Blum was sceptical about working on the film because he did not understand Stern's appeal, but his opinion changed after Reitman brought him to New York City to sit in on Stern's radio show for two days. Blum said, [...] "On the flight home I asked myself, 'Should I do this?' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> had laughed harder in the last two days than I had in the past 20 years." [...] In the following months, Blum and Kalesniko collaborated on a script with Stern that he finally approved, which then underwent further revisions for Blum to incorporate Stern's improvisations and speech patterns. During his visit to the show, Blum talked to Quivers, Norris, Dell'Abate, and Melendez about how they first met Stern and recorded his conversations. In a November 1995 interview, Stern announced: [...] "It's bizarre and funny. We're green-lighted to go into production".|$|E
40|$|In late 2010, {{those of}} us {{interested}} in the Middle East were surprised by persistent protests in Tunisia. My family and I were evacuated from Cairo on February 2, 2011. I returned to Egypt on February 13, and a week later, a major day of rage started the revolution in Morocco, with large protests breaking out in all major cities and even many minor ones. Like millions, I avidly watched the music videos and music clips that supported and resulted from the protests in Tunis and Cairo. In particular, I checked the Internet for news from Morocco. I was unsurprised to see Moroccans taking part in massive protests. I was also not surprised to see them using songs and chants. What did surprise me was the presence of one song. This song, “Feen Ghadi Biya Khoya, ” was familiar to me. In 2006 in Tangier, I heard a 2003 cover by the bar band Hoba Hoba Spirit that was included on a mixtape CD I got free with a magazine issue. The song sparked my memory, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> had already had the original from a 1973 Nass al-Ghiwane album, which I had bought years before on CD and which was already in my iTunes library.
