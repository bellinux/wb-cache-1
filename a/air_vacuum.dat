In a wet-sump engine the crank shaft and other moving parts splash through the oil at thousands of RPM causing a [...] "hurricane that whips {{the oil in}} a wet-sump engine into an aerated froth like a milkshake in a blender". Additionally, in a wet-sump, each revolution generates minute amounts of parasitic power loss caused by viscous drag and air drag (or 'windage') as the parts move rapidly through the oil and air in the lower engine. At high RPM these small sources of drag compound dramatically, resulting in significant power loss. In a dry-sump, the scavenger pump removes the oil and therefore the source of viscous friction, but also creates an <b>air</b> <b>vacuum</b> that significantly reduces air-friction, thus freeing the moving parts of much viscous and air friction and allowing engine power output to increase.|$|E
5000|$|An {{electrical}} contact is an electrical circuit component found in electrical switches, relays, connectors and circuit breakers. Each contact {{is a piece}} of electrically conductive material, usually metal. When a pair of contacts touch, they can pass an electrical current with a certain contact resistance, dependent on surface structure, surface chemistry and contact time; when the pair is separated by an insulating gap, then the pair does not pass a current. When the contacts touch, the switch is [...] "closed"; when the contacts are separated, the switch is [...] "open". The gap must be an insulating medium such as <b>air,</b> <b>vacuum,</b> oil, SF6 or other electrically insulating fluid. Contacts may be operated by humans in push-buttons and switches, by mechanical pressure in sensors or machine cams, and electromechanically in relays.

50|$|Vacuum bag {{moulding}} uses a flexible film to enclose the part and seal it from outside <b>air.</b> <b>Vacuum</b> bag material {{is available in}} a tube shape or a sheet of material. A vacuum is then drawn on the vacuum bag and atmospheric pressure compresses the part during the cure. When a tube shaped bag is used, the entire part can be enclosed within the bag. When using sheet bagging materials, {{the edges of the}} vacuum bag are sealed against the edges of the mould surface to enclose the part against an air-tight mould. When bagged in this way, the lower mold is a rigid structure and the upper surface of the part is formed by the flexible membrane vacuum bag. The flexible membrane can be a reusable silicone material or an extruded polymer film. After sealing the part inside the vacuum bag, a vacuum is drawn on the part (and held) during cure. This process can be performed at either ambient or elevated temperature with ambient atmospheric pressure acting upon the vacuum bag. A vacuum pump is typically used to draw a vacuum. An economical method of drawing a vacuum is with a venturi vacuum and air compressor.|$|E
