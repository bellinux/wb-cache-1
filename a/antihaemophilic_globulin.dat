40|$|VON WILLEBRAND'S FACTOR WAS DETERMINED IN 30 NORMAL SUBJECTS, 15 MALES AND 15 FEMALES, AGED 18 - 40 YEARS. THE FACTOR WAS ASSAYED BY THE USING THE RISTOCETIN - INDUCED PLATELET AGGREGATION TECHNIQUE OF WEISS ET AL (1973 B) SLIGHTLY MODIFIED. IN PARALLEL THE ANTIGENIC MOLECULE OF <b>ANTIHAEMOPHILIC</b> <b>GLOBULIN</b> WAS MEASURED USING AN IMMUNOCHEMICAL METHOD. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE V. W. FACTOR WAS SLIGHTLY HIGHER IN WOMEN THAN IN MEN (MEN: M= 97. 3 %+-ΣΑ 32. 9 %, WOMEN: M= 117 %+-ΣΑ 27. 5 %); SIMILAR RESULTS WERE OBTAINED FOR THE ANTIGENIC MOLECULE OF <b>ANTIHAEMOPHILIC</b> <b>GLOBULIN</b> (MEN: M = 86 %+-ΣΑ 27. 8 %, WOMEN: M= 97. 1 %+-ΣΑ 17. 2 %). THE VONWILLEBRAND FACTOR, ASSAYED BY THE RISTOCETIN - INDUCED PLATELET AGGREGATION AND THE ANTIGENIC MOLECULE OF <b>ANTIHAEMOPHILIC</b> <b>GLOBULIN,</b> MEASURED BY IMMUNOCHEMICAL METHOD WERE HIGHLY STATISTICALLY CORRELATED (R= 0. 77, P< 0. 001). ...|$|E
40|$|A case is {{described}} in which a circulating anticoagulant, inhibiting <b>antihaemophilic</b> <b>globulin,</b> developed following temporal arteritis. The circulating anticoagulant disappeared with steroid therapy, reappearing when steroids were withdrawn. Permanent maintenance therapy appears necessary in this case to prevent haemorrhagic manifestations...|$|E
40|$|A {{circulating}} anticoagulant inhibiting <b>antihaemophilic</b> <b>globulin</b> (A. H. G.) {{is described}} in an otherwise healthy 70 -year-old woman, and the therapeutic response to steroids is discussed. The nature and pathogenesis of the anticoagulant remain obscure, but its properties and behaviour do not support an autoimmune aetiology...|$|E
40|$|An {{inhibitor}} of <b>antihaemophilic</b> <b>globulin</b> {{has been}} found in association with penicillin allergy. Inhibitor activity was detected after a severe reaction of penicillin. Neutralization studies showed the activity resided in an IgG globulin with kappa light chains. Experiments with insolubilized gammaglobulin demonstrated that the activity of the inhibitor was found in a specific penicillin antibody...|$|E
40|$|Infusion of {{commercial}} preparations of porcine and bovine <b>antihaemophilic</b> <b>globulin</b> into three haemophilic patients produced transient thrombocytopenia. This platelet-aggregating activity {{has been shown}} to be present in a wide range of animal plasmas and is related to the fibrinogen fraction. The mechanism of platelet aggregation by animal fibrinogen is discussed and some inhibitors of the reaction are described...|$|E
40|$|Human plasma {{containing}} the Australia (hepatitis-associated) antigen was fractionated {{by the cold}} ethanol method of Cohn, Strong, Hughes, Mulford, Ashworth, Melin, and Taylor (1946) and small aliquots were examined {{for the presence of}} this antigen by immunodiffusion and by electron microscopy. The findings were in general agreement with the postulated risk of transmitting hepatitis by blood derivatives. The Australia (hepatitis-associated) antigen was detected in fibrinogen, thrombin, and <b>antihaemophilic</b> <b>globulin</b> as well as in other fractions. The antigen was not found in gamma globulin (immunoglobulin fraction) nor in albumin...|$|E
40|$|THIS case is {{reported}} {{because of the}} rarity of Christmas disease. Although the patient was referred to the out-patients department with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and a request for further cortisone treatment, it was found on close questioning {{that he had a}} history of bleeding since infancy. Case Report M. M., a male artist aged 25 years, complained of recent acute pain in the left hip together with previous episodes of pain in the right hip, right knee, and left elbow joints. He had been treated elsewhere with systemic cortisone, 25 mg. a day, for a period of two to three weeks. He was known to have a tendency to bleed, this being first noticed during circumcision and accepted as due to haemophilia, though it had not responded to <b>antihaemophilic</b> <b>globulin.</b> He had no family history of bleeding. Clinical examination showed early flexion deformity of the right hip and knee joints and a hot, tender swelling in the thigh with bruising consistent with haemarthrosis. Neither the peripheral joints nor the spine were affected, and all other systems were normal. Haematological investigation showed: clotting time, 30 minutes; bleeding time, 1 minutes; prothrombin time, 100...|$|E
40|$|In {{the theory}} of blood {{coagulation}} proposed by Biggs (1955) it is supposed that blood thrombo-plastin is produced by the interaction of anti-haemophilic globulin, Christmas factor, platelet lipoid factor, factor VII, factor V, and calcium. Russell viper venom (R. V. V.) {{can act as a}} thromboplastin, i. e., convert prothrombin to thrombin, only after combination with platelet lipoid factor and factor V (Rapaport, Aas, and Owren, 1954 a). The action of R. V. V. would, therefore, appear to resemble that of a mixture of <b>antihaemophilic</b> <b>globulin,</b> Christmas factor, and factor VII, and the observation of Owren (1954) that R. V. V. gives normal one-stage prothrombin times with samples of plasma deficient in these sub-stances supports this hypothesis. The experiments described in this paper were undertaken to obtain more direct evidence of the relation of R. V. V. to the substances developed during coagulation. The thromboplastin generation test devised by Biggs and Douglas (1953), which enables the contribu-tions of the clotting factors in plasma, in serum, and in platelets to be assessed separately, was used for this purpose. By introducing R. V. V. in place of the ordinary constituents of the test, the relative efficacy of R. V. V. and the thromboplastin ante-cedents found in the human blood has been deter-mined. In addition, the effect of plasma lipoid on the coagulant action of. R. V. V. (Macfarlane, Trevan, and Attwood, 1941; Fullerton and Anastasopoulos, 1949) and the effect of adsorption of R. V. V. on a mineral precipitate (Jenkins, 1954) have been re-investigated...|$|E
