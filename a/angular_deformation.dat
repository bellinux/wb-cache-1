40|$|In this paper, the {{deformed}} Special Relativity, {{which leads}} to an essentially new theoretical context of quantum mechanics, is presented. The formulation of the theory arises from a straightforward analogy with the Special Relativity, but its foundations are laid through the hypothesis on breakdown of the velocity-momentum parallelism which affects onto the Einstein equivalence principle between mass and energy of a relativistic particle. Furthermore, the derivation {{is based on the}} technique of an eikonal equation whose well-confirmed physical role lays the foundations of both optics and quantum mechanics. As a result, we receive the <b>angular</b> <b>deformation</b> of Special Relativity which clearly depicts the new deformation-based theoretical foundations of physics, and, moreover, offers both constructive and consistent phenomenological discussion of the theoretical issues such like imaginary mass and formal superluminal motion predicted in Special Relativity for this case. In the context of the relativistic theory, presence of deformation does not break the Poincaré invariance, in particular the Lorentz symmetry, and provides essential modifications of both bosons described through the Klein-Gordon equation and fermions satisfying the Dirac equation. On the other hand, on the level of discussion of quantum theory, there arises the concept of emergent deformed space-time, wherein the presence of <b>angular</b> <b>deformation</b> elucidates a certain new insight into the nature of spin, as well as both the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and the Schrödinger wave equation.

40|$|Dynamic {{equations}} {{which include}} the effects of unsteady aerodynamic forces and a flexible body structure were developed for a free flying high performance fighter aircraft. The linear and <b>angular</b> <b>deformations</b> {{are assumed to be}} small in the body reference frame, allowing the equations to be linearized in the deformation variables. Equations for total body dynamics and flexible body dynamics are formulated using the hybrid coordinate method and integrated in a state space format. A detailed finite element model of a generic high performance fighter aircraft is used to generate the mass and stiffness matrices. Unsteady aerodynamics are represented by a rational function approximation of the doublet lattice matrices. The equations simplify for the case of constant angular rate of the body reference frame, allowing the effect of roll rate to be studied by computing the eigenvalues of the system. It is found that the rigid body modes of the aircraft are greatly affected by introducing a constant roll rate, while the effect on the flexible modes is minimal for this configuration...|$|R

In SO diabetic rats, no osteoblasts, osteoid tissue, or osteoclasts were {{present on the}} trabecular bone surface, but trabecular bone volume (TBV) remained normal compared with control BB rats. The concentration of IGF-I per dry weight of humerus was decreased after 12 weeks of diabetes, whereas the concentrations of calcium and osteocalcin did not change. DXA analysis showed normal bone mineral density (BMD) at both diaphyseal and metaphyseal femoral areas. On biomechanical testing, <b>angular</b> <b>deformation,</b> energy absorption, and torsional strength of the femora were decreased after 8 - 12 weeks of diabetes, but stiffness was normal. Ovariectomy in diabetic rats caused a decrease in femoral BMD especially at the metaphysis, {{and there was a}} trend toward decreased TBV in the tibial metaphysis; TBV loss was less marked than in control OVX rats, however. The increase in BMD at the femoral diaphysis, measured after 12 weeks of OVX in control rats, was absent in diabetic rats. Multiple-regression analysis indicated that the presence of diabetes but not ovariectomy, weight, and mineral content correlated with decreased energy absorption, <b>angular</b> <b>deformation,</b> and strength of the femora.
