50|$|A framed Letter of Thanks was {{presented}} to Helmsman Simeon Rabaiotti, for rescuing a man cut off by the tide on 25 May. The ILB veered down through rocks in rough seas and in a heavy three metre swell; the <b>anchor</b> <b>warp</b> had to be cut to leave the scene.|$|E
50|$|Fairlead-A U-shape or {{circular}} fitting often positioned {{near the}} bow that leads an <b>anchor</b> <b>warp</b> or a sheet to a cleat or winch. The anchor fairlead is usually bronze or stainless steel {{as it must}} take the regular abrasion of the warp and chain. The anchor fairlead is usually set on the change of angle between the deck and the topside to prevent wear and tear.|$|E
50|$|A {{cruising}} {{boat with}} a cabin and choice of outboard well or 6-8 hp Sabb inboard Diesel engine. Draft 2'+. Long keel with fixed bilge plates. Original spec included sails with roller-reef jib, pramhood canopy, two-burner paraffin cooker, flushing chemical toilet, fitted bilge pump, <b>anchor</b> <b>warp</b> and chain; anti-fouling below waterline. An optional tent was also available, extending sleeping accommodation {{from two to}} four adults.|$|E
50|$|Warp-anchor rope. Traditionally made {{of natural}} fibre such as hemp, modern warps {{are made of}} stronger, lighter, {{synthetic}} fibre, often laid nylon, which is elastic so absorbing shock loads which would otherwise pull out the <b>anchor.</b> <b>Warps</b> are normally at least 3 times {{the depth of the}} water. In strong wind and/or current the warp should be at least 6 times the water depth.|$|R
50|$|Other Equipment - Electric {{running and}} riding lights, <b>anchor</b> and <b>warp,</b> boat hook, flag staff, canvas bucket, mop, few tools, fenders, life ring, dock lines, compass and binnacle, life lines, pulpit dinghy chocks, hatch and {{skylight}} covers.|$|R
50|$|Sea anchors {{may also}} be used as <b>anchors</b> to allow <b>warping</b> of a vessel in deep water.|$|R
50|$|It is both {{ancient and}} modern {{practice}} for anchor capstans and jib winches to be slightly flared out at the base, rather than cylindrical, to prevent the rope (<b>anchor</b> <b>warp</b> or sail sheet) from sliding down. The rope wound several times around the winch can slip upwards gradually, with little risk of a riding turn, provided it is tailed (loose end is pulled clear), by hand or a self-tailer.|$|E
50|$|A small anchor {{can be used}} {{to allow}} the crew of the dinghy to fish or rest. Dinghy anchors are usually either a {{mushroom}} shape, a small folding grapple hook or the more modern and efficient Danforth type, with floating rope that will avoid being cut by snags on the bottom. The mushroom is used in locations where the bottom is very muddy, while the grapple works better in rocks. Some persons prefer a small Danforth or plow,because of their superior holding power in all but rocks, but these have sharp edges, and need to be set with a little care. Even a dinghy should have a length of chain attached to the anchor - the same length as the dinghy. The warp then attaches to the short chain with a wired shackle. This gives added weight and help in setting an anchor. It also stops the warp fraying on sharp rocks when the dinghy swings to and fro with the tide. Generally an <b>anchor</b> <b>warp</b> should be 4 times the depth of the water. In strong winds this can be extended to 8 times the depth but most dinghies are not seaworthy enough to be anchored securely in such storm conditions.|$|E
50|$|Fibres {{of various}} {{strengths}} {{were used to}} fashion eel traps (hinaki), surprisingly large fishing nets (kupenga) and lines, bird snares, cordage for ropes, baskets (kete), bags, mats, clothing, sandals (paraerae), buckets, food baskets (rourou), and cooking utensils etc. The handmade flax cording and ropes had such great tensile strength that {{they were used to}} successfully bind together sections of hollowed out logs to create huge ocean-going canoes (waka). With the help of wakas, pre-European Māori deployed seine nets which could be over one thousand metres long. The nets were woven from green flax, with stone weights and light wood or gourd floats, and could require hundreds of men to haul. It was also used to make rigging, sails and lengthy <b>anchor</b> <b>warps,</b> and roofs for housing. Frayed ends of flax leaves were fashioned into torches and lights for use at night. The dried flower stalks, which are extremely light, were bound together with flax twine to make river rafts called mokihi.|$|R
50|$|Synthetic rope - There are 4 common ropes in use. Polyester, {{also called}} Dacron or Terylene, is a strong, low stretch rope, usually plaited (braided) used for running rigging. Nylon is a strong, but elastic rope, used for mooring lines and <b>anchor</b> <b>warps</b> as it resists shock loads. It is usually laid (twisted) {{so that it}} is easier to grip when hauling. Polypropylene is a light, cheap, {{slippery}} rope, that floats. It is much weaker than the previous ropes. It weakens when exposed to sunlight. It is usually laid construction. Commonly used on commercial fishing boats using nets. Kevlar is an extremely strong fibre that is now made into ropes with almost no stretch. Expensive. Suited to halyards instead of stainless steel wire. Often used on racing yachts to replace polyester when powerful winches are used. Kevlar ropes can be much smaller in diameter than polyester for the same strength. This saves windage on a racing yacht. Usually braided.|$|R
50|$|The boat {{carries a}} variety of {{equipment}} which includes two VHF radios, First Aid Kit & oxygen, GPS navigation system, night vision equipment, self-righting system, <b>anchor</b> and various <b>warps,</b> toolkit, towing system, illuminating and distress pyrotechnics, spotlight, torches.|$|R
6000|$|... "So am I," [...] {{replied the}} captain; [...] "but we can {{scarcely}} manage it, I fear, {{on account of}} the shore ice. Get out a boat, Mr Saunders, and try to fix an <b>anchor.</b> We may <b>warp</b> in a few yards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Mr. George, [...] "they can warp {{where there}} is not any shore at all, {{provided}} that the water is not too deep. In that case they take a small anchor in a boat, and row forward {{to the length of}} the line, and then drop the <b>anchor,</b> and so <b>warp</b> to that." ...|$|R
5000|$|The B-536 was {{launched}} from a supplied trolley which was towed from the boathouse by a tractor. The boat was 7.21 m {{in length and}} she had a beam of 2.49 m, and a draught of 0.81 m. She was powered through the water by twin 2-stroke outboard engines, of [...] each. Her equipment included two VHF radios, First Aid Kit & oxygen, GPS navigation system, night vision equipment, self-righting system, <b>anchor</b> and various <b>warps,</b> toolkit, towing system, illuminating and distress pyrotechnics, spotlight, torches. The rollbar assembly installed above the engines contains a self-righting bag which was operated {{by a member of the}} crew activating a gas bottle.|$|R
5000|$|Vessels {{may carry}} {{a number of}} anchors: bower anchors (formerly known as sheet anchors) are the main anchors used by a vessel and {{normally}} carried at {{the bow of the}} vessel. A kedge anchor is a light <b>anchor</b> used for <b>warping</b> an <b>anchor,</b> also known as kedging, or more commonly on yachts for mooring quickly or in benign conditions. A stream anchor, which is usually heavier than a kedge anchor, can be used for kedging or warping in addition to temporary mooring and restraining stern movement in tidal conditions or in waters where vessel movement needs to be restricted, such as rivers and channels. [...] A Killick anchor is a small, possibly improvised, anchor.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{continued}} Mrs de Lacey, slowly {{following the}} footsteps of the governess, who had already moved from beneath the ruin; [...] "whole fleets have often been towed to their <b>anchors,</b> and there <b>warped,</b> waiting for wind and tide to serve. None of our sex know the dangers of the Ocean, but we who have been bound in the closest of all ties to officers of rank and great service; and none others can ever truly enjoy the real grandeur of the ennobling profession. A charming object is a vessel cutting the waves with her taffrail, and chasing her wake on the trackless waters, like a courser that ever keeps in his path, though dashing madly on {{at the very top of}} his speed!--" ...|$|R
50|$|Philip Hefner {{uses the}} analogy of weaving to {{describe}} the Epic. The <b>warp</b> <b>anchors</b> the story and the weft creates the pattern and the tapestry. The Epic, as scientists see it, is the warp and the weft forms the pattern as each of us views it (we are all weavers) but the patterns all have the warp in common. Hefner writes that stories about the evolutionary epic are redolent with ultimacy. It is not science; it is scientifically informed myth, a myth driven by the refusal {{to give up on}} the insistence that the natural world and our lives in the world have meaning and purpose. It is a mythical tale of irony and hope that fills a large space in the domaine of religion-and-science. Biologist Ursula Goodenough also makes use of Hefner’s weaving metaphor.|$|R
40|$|Figure 1 : A {{sequence}} of painted AR frames. A real green cup, a real black cover book, a virtual teapot and a virtual bunny on a table. A seamless blending {{of the real}} and virtual worlds is key to increased immersion and improved user experiences for augmented reality (AR). Photorealistic and non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) {{are two ways to}} achieve this goal. Non-photorealistic rendering creates an abstract version of both the real and virtual world by stylization to make them indistinguishable. We present a painterly rendering algorithm for AR applications. This algorithm paints composed AR video frames with bump-mapping curly brushstrokes. Tensor fields are created for each frame to define the direction for the brushstrokes. We use tensor field pyramids to interpolate sparse tensor field values over the frame to avoid the numeric problems caused by global radial basis interpolation in existing algorithms. Due to the characteristics of AR applications we use only information from the current frame and previous frame to provide temporal coherence in two ways for the painted video. First, brushstroke <b>anchors</b> are <b>warped</b> from the previous frame to the current frame based on their neighbor feature points. Second, brushstroke appearances are reshaped by blending two parameterized brushstrokes to achieve better temporal coherence. The major difference between our algorithm and existing NPR work in general graphics and AR/VR areas is that we use feature points across AR frames to maintain coherence in the rendering. The use of tensor field pyramids and extra properties of brushstrokes, such as cut-off angles, are also novel features that extend exiting NPR algorithms...|$|R
5000|$|The anchor bend is a knot {{used for}} {{attaching}} a rope to a ring or similar termination. Its name originates {{from the time}} when [...] "bend" [...] was understood to mean [...] "tie to", and not restricted to knots that join rope ends. While the knot can become jammed in some modern materials, it is usually easily untied after moderate loads; {{it can be made}} more resistant to jamming by taking an extra turn around the object--this will make for a 1-diameter longer span of the end to reach around the standing part to be tucked (although in a case of tying to a small shackle or link of a chain, this might not be possible). It is the accepted knot for attaching anchors (or more usually <b>anchor</b> chains) to <b>warps.</b> The knot is very similar to a round turn and two half hitches except that the first half hitch is passed under the turn. In many everyday uses, the finishing half-hitch need not be made; alternatively, one might seek surer security by tying off the end with a strangle knot to the standing part.|$|R
50|$|The Atlantic 75-class {{superseded}} the Atlantic 21-class. The name Atlantic {{is derived}} from Atlantic College in Wales, where the rigid inflatable B-class was first developed. The designation 75 {{is derived from}} its length of nearly 7.5 m. A significant improvement to this class over the 21 is {{the addition of a}} ballast tank installed {{at the front of the}} lifeboat which enables the craft to launch into larger surf than the previous class. The ballast when full, either of sea water or water from a hose, weighs the same as three fully grown men. The lifeboat has a crew of three and has a top speed of 32 kn and can operated in severe weather conditions up to winds of near gale force. The design incorporates twin outboard engines which are completely waterproofed, even if totally immersed. The hull of the lifeboat is constructed from Glass Reinforced plastic with a hypalon coated polyester which is highly resistant attack by marine organisms, chemicals and temperature extremes. The lifeboat had a displacement of 1.6 tonnes. Her equipment included two VHF radios, First Aid Kit & oxygen, GPS navigation system, night vision equipment, self-righting system, <b>anchor</b> and various <b>warps,</b> toolkit, towing system, illuminating and distress pyrotechnics, spotlight, torches. The rollbar assembly installed above the engines contains a self-righting bag which was operated by a member of the crew activating a gas bottle.|$|R
6000|$|... “In {{less than}} an hour she came up within musket-shot, and yawing to bring all her guns to bear, poured in a {{broadside}} that I thought would have annihilated us. Fortunately she had answered her helm so quickly that as she came round her guns bore ahead of us, and the round shot struck the water under our bows. The grape, however, cut up the rigging, riddled the sails, and damaged the masts, and as the next broadside would assuredly have sunk us, Cochrane ordered the flag to be hauled down. Nothing could have been kinder than our treatment. The captain declined to accept Cochrane’s sword, begging him to continue to wear it though a prisoner. In our thirteen months’ cruise we had taken or retaken upwards of fifty vessels, one hundred and twenty-two guns, and five hundred and thirty-four prisoners. After our capture the French line-of-battle ships took us and our lubberly convoy into Algeciras. It was trying to be lying there almost within range of the guns of Gibraltar. Two or three days later Sir James Saumarez sailed in with a powerful squadron. The French at once put out boats, carried <b>anchors</b> ashore, and <b>warped</b> in until they grounded, so as to prevent being attacked on both sides. The tide brought the British ships so fast up the bay that in the hurry of the work the French ships still lay head to shore, and were therefore helpless to offer any defence to the expected attack. The greater part of the French sailors were at once sent ashore to the powerful Spanish batteries there, and a very effective fire was opened upon the British ships. Nothing, however, could have prevented the capture of the French vessels had there been any wind.|$|R
5000|$|Gower and {{his family}} removed to Nova Scotia House at Ipswich in 1817. There he devoted himself to the invention, patenting, design and {{building}} of a remarkable series of novel vessels including three vessels named Transit, a fly boat, two yachts the Unique and the Gower, the Landguard Fort Lifeboat, {{and a number of}} other inventions. He entered, but did not win, a competition for a novel form of lock for the Regents Canal. He suggested that, to protect coastal traffic, cruisers be stationed along the coast in communication with signal stations to provide a concerted defence system. He proposed a form of vertical-vaned windmill; an eye shade; various ship's logs and a [...] "double-barrelled" [...] capstan to do two jobs at once. He suggested a non-elastic substitute for imported hempen standing rigging to be made of wooden cylinders joined together by iron straps. He devised a method of keeping ships at proper distances by using the mast as a base line. He invented a mode of dropping a guess <b>warp</b> <b>anchor</b> with such accuracy that its end could be easily found and lifted. He devised a novel method of fidding a topgallant mast and several contrivances for the [...] "better nipping and stopping a cable". He designed a long catamaran for forming a life raft and a form of floating sea anchor, or drogue anchor (he called it a [...] "propeller") like an umbrella. He created a set of signals, that could be seen from all angles, using shapes instead of flags. He also suggested using a floating compass needle to find North. He experimented with various designs of paddle wheel on the River Lee Canal that anticipated the design of the wheels used by steam paddlers many years later. He invented and built the Landguard Fort Lifeboat, which carried up to 25 people and was virtually unsinkable. He proposed fitting canal barges with 'spud wheels' that could propel the vessel by catching on the canal bottom. He saw that a combination of paddle wheels and spud wheels could take vessels over mud flats at various conditions of the tide. Gower also constructed a twin hulled catamaran, just ten feet long, on which he mounted a barrel of water that drained to underwater by a curved pipe pointing aft. His twin floats achieved two miles per hour apparently without the need for power from sail or steam. He thus demonstrated water jet propulsion. He anticipated that a steam water pump, so contrived, could propel vessels without the need for paddles. He gives credit to Dr Franklin (probably Benjamin Franklin) and a Mr Rumsay of Philadelphia for this idea and hoped that his little experiment would encourage others to pursue the notion.|$|R
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of the Internet, nowadays tremendous amounts of data including images and videos, up to millions or billions, can be collected for training machine learning models. Inspired by this trend, this thesis is dedicated to developing large-scale machine learning techniques {{for the purpose of}} making classification and nearest neighbor search practical on gigantic databases. Our first approach is to explore data graphs to aid classification and nearest neighbor search. A graph offers an attractive way of representing data and discovering the essential information such as the neighborhood structure. However, both of the graph construction process and graph-based learning techniques become computationally prohibitive at a large scale. To this end, we present an efficient large graph construction approach and subsequently apply it to develop scalable semi-supervised learning and unsupervised hashing algorithms. Our unique contributions on the graph-related topics include: 1. Large Graph Construction: Conventional neighborhood graphs such as kNN graphs require a quadratic time complexity, which is inadequate for large-scale applications mentioned above. To overcome this bottleneck, we present a novel graph construction approach, called Anchor Graphs, which enjoys linear space and time complexities and can thus be constructed over gigantic databases efficiently. The central idea of the Anchor Graph is introducing a few anchor points and converting intensive data-to-data affinity computation to drastically reduced data-to-anchor affinity computation. A low-rank data-to-data affinity matrix is derived using the data-to-anchor affinity matrix. We also theoretically prove that the Anchor Graph lends itself to an intuitive probabilistic interpretation by showing that each entry of the derived affinity matrix can be considered as a transition probability between two data points through Markov random walks. 2. Large-Scale Semi-Supervised Learning: We employ Anchor Graphs to develop a scalable solution for semi-supervised learning, which capitalizes on both labeled and unlabeled data to learn graph-based classification models. We propose several key methods to build scalable semi-supervised kernel machines such that real-world linearly inseparable data can be tackled. The proposed techniques take advantage of the Anchor Graph from a kernel point of view, generating a set of low-rank kernels which are made to encompass the neighborhood structure unveiled by the Anchor Graph. By linearizing these low-rank kernels, training nonlinear kernel machines in semi-supervised settings can be simplified to training linear SVMs in supervised settings, so the computational cost for classifier training is substantially reduced. We accomplish excellent classification performance by applying the proposed semi-supervised kernel machine - a linear SVM with a linearized <b>Anchor</b> Graph <b>warped</b> kernel. 3. Unsupervised Hashing: To achieve fast point-to-point search, compact hashing with short hash codes has been suggested, but how to learn codes such that good search performance is achieved remains a challenge. Moreover, in many cases real-world data sets are assumed to live on manifolds, which should be taken into account in order to capture meaningful nearest neighbors. To this end, we present a novel unsupervised hashing approach based on the Anchor Graph which captures the underlying manifold structure. The Anchor Graph Hashing approach allows constant time hashing of a new data point by extrapolating graph Laplacian eigenvectors to eigenfunctions. Furthermore, a hierarchical threshold learning procedure is devised to produce multiple hash bits for each eigenfunction, thus leading to higher search accuracy. As a result, Anchor Graph Hashing exhibits good search performance in finding semantically similar neighbors. To address other practical application scenarios, we further develop advanced hashing techniques that incorporate supervised information or leverage unique formulations to cope with new forms of queries such as hyperplanes. 4. Supervised Hashing: Recent research has shown that the hashing quality could be boosted by leveraging supervised information into hash function learning. However, the existing methods either lack adequate performance or often incur cumbersome model training. To this end, we present a novel kernel-based supervised hashing model which requires a limited amount of supervised information in the form of similar and dissimilar data pairs, and is able to achieve high hashing quality at a practically feasible training cost. The idea is to map the data to compact binary codes whose Hamming distances are simultaneously minimized on similar pairs and maximized on dissimilar pairs. Our approach is distinct from prior work in utilizing the equivalence between optimizing the code inner products and the Hamming distances. This enables us to sequentially and efficiently train the hash functions one bit at a time, yielding very short yet discriminative codes. The presented supervised hashing approach is general, allowing search of both semantically similar neighbors and metric distance neighbors. 5. Hyperplane Hashing: Hyperplane hashing aims at rapidly searching the database points near a given hyperplane query, and has shown practical impact on large-scale active learning with SVMs. The existing hyperplane hashing methods are randomized and need long hash codes to achieve reasonable search accuracy, thus resulting in reduced search speed and large memory overhead. We present a novel hyperplane hashing technique which yields high search accuracy with compact hash codes. The key idea is a novel bilinear form used in designing the hash functions, leading to a higher collision probability than all of the existing hyperplane hash functions when using random projections. To further increase the performance, we develop a learning based framework in which the bilinear functions are directly learned from the input data. This results in compact yet discriminative codes, as demonstrated by the superior search performance over all random projection based solutions. We divide the thesis into two parts: scalable classification with graphs (topics 1 and 2 mentioned above), and nearest neighbor search with hashing (topics 3, 4 and 5 mentioned above). The two parts are connected {{in the sense that the}} idea of Anchor Graphs in Part I enables not only scalable classification but also unsupervised hashing, and hyperplane hashing in Part II can directly benefit classification under an active learning framework. All of the machine learning techniques developed in this thesis emphasize and pursue excellent performance in both speed and accuracy, which are verified through extensive experiments carried out on various large-scale tasks of classification and search. The addressed problems, classification and nearest neighbor search, are fundamental for many real-world applications. Therefore, we expect that the proposed solutions based on graphs and hashing will have a tremendous impact on a great number of realistic large-scale applications...|$|R
