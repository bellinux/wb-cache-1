5|$|The {{aircraft}} carrier II was a proposed conversion {{project for the}} incomplete French cruiser De Grasse. The ship was laid down in November 1938 and lay incomplete in the Arsenal de Lorient shipyard when Germany invaded France in May 1940. In 1942, Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine decided to convert the cruiser into an auxiliary {{aircraft carrier}} with a capacity for twenty-three fighters and dive bombers. Work ceased in February 1943, however, due to concerns with the ship's design, a severe shortage of material and labor, {{and the threat of}} Allied bombing raids. The ship was eventually completed as an <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>cruiser</b> in 1956 by the French Navy.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Navy {{provided}} the <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>cruiser</b> HMS Calcutta, 39 destroyers, {{and many other}} craft. The Merchant Navy supplied passenger ferries, hospital ships, and other vessels. Britain's Belgian, Dutch, Canadian, and French allies provided vessels as well. Admiral Ramsay arranged for around a thousand copies {{to be made of}} the required charts, had buoys laid around the Goodwin Sands and down to Dunkirk, and organised the flow of shipping. Larger ships such as destroyers were able to carry about 900 men per trip. The soldiers mostly travelled on the upper decks for fear of being trapped below if the ship sank. After the loss on 29 May of 19 British and French navy ships plus three of the larger requisitioned vessels, the Admiralty withdrew their eight best destroyers for the future defence of the country.|$|E

5|$|The French cruiser De Grasse {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Arsenal de Lorient {{shipyard}} in Lorient in November 1938. Work on the unfinished ship stopped following the German conquest of France in May 1940. In 1942, the Kriegsmarine considered several proposals to convert the cruiser into an auxiliary aircraft carrier. The final proposal was completed by August 1942, but work on the conversion did not last long. By February 1943, the project had been abandoned, for several reasons. The shipyard suffered from a shortage of labor and materials, and the design staff had significant concerns over {{the arrangement of the}} engine system. The Allies also posed a serious threat, as Lorient was well within the range of Allied bombers. The ship was eventually retaken by the French Navy {{after the end of the}} war, and launched in 1946. She was ultimately completed in 1956 as an <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>cruiser.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following {{conversion}} to an <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>cruiser,</b> Calcutta joined the Home Fleet in August 1939 and in September was {{allocated to the}} Humber Force, acting as an anti-aircraft escort for convoys in the North Sea. She returned to the Home Fleet in February but continued to escort convoys {{as well as the}} Fleet.|$|E
25|$|The final {{proposal}} for an auxiliary aircraft carrier conversion {{was for the}} incomplete French cruiser , {{which was in the}} shipyard at Lorient. As projected, the ship was to have carried a force of eleven fighters and twelve bombers. The conversion plan was prepared by August 1942, but work never began, and the project was cancelled by February 1943. There was not a sufficient work force remaining in Lorient to complete the ship, the harbor was within range of Allied bombers in Britain, and the ship's propulsion system proved to be troublesome for the designers. Ultimately, the unfinished cruiser was retaken by Allied forces and she was completed as an <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>cruiser</b> for the French Navy by 1956.|$|E
50|$|A {{tactical}} shortcoming was recognised {{after completing}} six additional conversions of s. Having sacrificed anti-ship weapons for anti-aircraft armament, the converted <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>cruisers</b> might need protection themselves against surface units. New construction was undertaken to create cruisers of similar speed and displacement with dual-purpose guns.|$|R
5000|$|The US built cruisers in {{quantity}} {{through the end}} of the war, notably 14 [...] heavy cruisers and 27 [...] light cruisers, along with eight [...] <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>cruisers.</b> The Cleveland class was the largest cruiser class ever built in number of ships completed, with nine additional Clevelands completed as light aircraft carriers. The large number of cruisers built was probably due to the significant cruiser losses of 1942 in the Pacific theater (seven American and five other Allied) and the perceived need for several cruisers to escort each of the numerous s being built. Losing four heavy and two small light cruisers in 1942, the Japanese built only five light cruisers during the war; these were small ships with six 6.1 in guns each. Losing 20 cruisers in 1940-42, the British completed no heavy cruisers, thirteen light cruisers (Crown Colony and Minotaur classes), and sixteen <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>cruisers</b> (...) during the war.|$|R

The Atlantas and Didos were borne out of the {{tactical}} need for vessels to protect aircraft carriers, battleships and convoys from air attack.|$|R
25|$|The Second Battle of Sirte was a naval {{engagement}} {{in which the}} escorting warships of a British convoy to Malta frustrated a much more powerful Regia Marina (Italian Navy) squadron. The British convoy was composed of four merchant ships escorted by four light cruisers, one <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>cruiser,</b> and 17 destroyers. The Italian force comprised a battleship, two heavy cruisers, one light cruiser, and eight destroyers. Despite the initial British success at warding off the Italian squadron, the battle delayed the convoy's planned arrival before dawn, which exposed it to intense air attacks that sank all four merchant ships {{and one of the}} escorting destroyers in the following days. The battle occurred on 22 March 1942 in the Mediterranean, north of the Gulf of Sidra and southeast of Malta, during the Second World War.|$|E

50|$|The first {{aircraft}} cruiser {{was originally}} a 1930s experimental concept {{of creating an}} all-around warship. The early aircraft cruisers were usually armed with relatively heavy artillery, mines {{and a number of}} aircraft fitted with floats (making the ship a kind of seaplane tender). The early aircraft cruiser {{turned out to be an}} unsuccessful design. The rapid development of naval aircraft in the 1930s quickly rendered the vessels obsolete, and they were rebuilt e.g. as <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>cruisers.</b>|$|R

During Operation Demon, the evacuation of Allied troops from Greece, she escorted Convoy GA15 on 29–30 April from Souda Bay, Crete, to Alexandria. An Italian destroyer and two torpedo boats attacked the convoy at night as it was transiting Kaso Strait east of Crete, but were rebuffed by the defenders without inflicting any damage. The following month Defender assisted in the evacuation of troops from Crete to Egypt after the Germans invaded on 22 May (Operation Merkur).|$|E

500|$|HMS Crescent was a [...] C-class {{destroyer}} {{which was}} built for the Royal Navy in the early 1930s. The ship was initially assigned to the Home Fleet, although she was temporarily deployed in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean during the Abyssinia Crisis of 1935–36. Crescent was sold to the Royal Canadian Navy in late 1936 and renamed HMCS Fraser. She was stationed {{on the west coast}} of Canada until the beginning of World War II when she was transferred to the Atlantic coast for convoy escort duties. The ship was transferred to the United Kingdom (UK) in May 1940 and helped to evacuate refugees from France upon her arrival in early June.

The last 5 of the Dido class {{also known as the}} Bellona-class <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>cruisers</b> mounted the 5.25 inch in the Remote Power Control RP10 Mk II mountings, which offered much improved training and elevating speeds. The number of turrets on the Bellona-class were reduced from five to four, and the number of light AA guns were increased. The RP10 Mk II mountings were also later used to replace the Mk I mountings on the HMS Anson. The last of the RN's battleships which was commisioned after the war, HMS Vanguard, featured Mk 1* turrets with enlarged gun houses compared to those fitted to the King George V and Dido class ships, although the width between the guns remained the same. [...] A slightly more powerful Mk II variant was also deployed by the British Army as an anti-aircraft and coast-defence gun.|$|R
5000|$|The Naval Battle of Guadalcanal {{occurred}} 12-15 November 1942 in two phases. A night surface {{action on}} 12-13 November {{was the first}} phase. The Japanese force consisted of two Kongō-class battleships with high explosive shells for bombarding Henderson Field, one small light cruiser, and 11 destroyers. Their plan was that the bombardment would neutralize Allied airpower and allow a force of 11 transport ships and 12 destroyers to reinforce Guadalcanal with a Japanese division the next day. However, US reconnaissance aircraft spotted the approaching Japanese on the 12th and the Americans made what preparations they could. The American force consisted of two heavy cruisers, one light <b>cruiser,</b> two <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>cruisers,</b> and eight destroyers. The Americans were badly outgunned by the Japanese that night, {{and a lack of}} pre-battle orders by the US commander led to confusion. [...] courageously closed with the battleship Hiei, firing all torpedoes (though apparently none hit or detonated) and raking the battleship's bridge with gunfire, wounding the Japanese admiral and killing his chief of staff. The Americans initially lost four destroyers including Laffey, with both heavy cruisers, most of the remaining destroyers, and both <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>cruisers</b> damaged. The Japanese initially had one battleship and four destroyers damaged, but at this point they withdrew, possibly unaware that the US force was unable to further oppose them. At dawn US aircraft from Henderson Field, , and Espiritu Santo found the damaged battleship and two destroyers in the area. The battleship (Hiei) was sunk by aircraft (or possibly scuttled), one destroyer was sunk by the damaged , and the other destroyer was attacked by aircraft but was able to withdraw. Both of the damaged US <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>cruisers</b> were lost on the 13th, one (...) torpedoed by a Japanese submarine, and the other sank on the way to repairs. Juneaus loss was especially tragic; the submarine's presence prevented immediate rescue, over 100 survivors of a crew of nearly 700 were adrift for eight days, and all but ten died. Among the dead were the five Sullivan brothers.|$|R
500|$|Together {{with three}} Australian destroyers and two British <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>cruisers,</b> the ship escorted a convoy from Egypt to Suda Bay, Crete {{and then to}} Malta in early November. In December she was {{assigned}} to intercept enemy supply convoys along the North African coast and captured two schooners off Bardia on 31 December. In early January 1941, Dainty escorted the capital ships of Force A during Operation Excess.

She then served as a repair ship at Devonport before being converted into a blockship in April 1941. On 14 April, Winston Churchill suggested that a heavy naval bombardment of the Libyan city of Tripoli should be made by the Mediterranean Fleet and followed up by blocking the port with a battleship and the Admiralty suggested [...] and a cruiser, but Admiral Andrew Cunningham, commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, rejected the idea of using one of his active battleships and suggested Centurion instead. Upon further consideration, he assessed the chance of success as one in ten due the difficulties of [...] "wedging herself in exactly the right position within point blank range of the enemy guns with enemy dive bombers overhead." [...] The ship was then modified to resemble Anson then building at HM Dockyard, Portsmouth.|$|E
500|$|Task Force 16 {{returned}} to the South Pacific in October 1942, {{just in time to}} take part in the decisive action of the campaign, the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, when the Japanese Army and Navy made an all-out effort to recapture the airfield of Guadalcanal. In addition to Enterprise, Kinkaid's force included the battleship South Dakota, heavy cruiser Portland, <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>cruiser</b> San Juan, and eight destroyers. Fortunately, both Enterprise and South Dakota had been fitted with the new Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns. In the three early carrier battles, Kinkaid had been a subordinate commander. This time he was in overall command, in charge of Task Force 61, which included both his own Task Force 16 and Rear Admiral George D. Murray's Task Force 17, built around the aircraft carrier [...] The battle unfolded badly. Hornet was sunk, and Enterprise, South Dakota and San Juan were severely damaged. Aviators like Murray and John H. Towers blamed Kinkaid, as a non-aviator, for the loss of Hornet. It became a black mark on Kinkaid's record. The Japanese had won another tactical victory, but Kinkaid's carriers had gained the Americans precious time to prepare and reinforce.|$|E
50|$|Twenty-three British cruisers {{were lost}} to enemy action, mostly to air attack and submarines, in {{operations}} in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Indian Ocean. Sixteen of these losses were in the Mediterranean. The British included <b>cruisers</b> and <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>cruisers</b> among convoy escorts in the Mediterranean and to northern Russia due {{to the threat of}} surface and air attack. Almost all cruisers in World War II were vulnerable to submarine attack {{due to a lack of}} anti-submarine sonar and weapons.

500|$|With the {{withdrawal}} of Enterprise in early May, Saratoga became the only operational American fleet carrier in the South Pacific. Task Force 14, as her group was now known, was reinforced by the <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>cruiser</b> [...] on 3 May and by the British fleet carrier [...] on 17 May. At this time Saratoga embarked 34 Wildcats of VF-5, 37 Dauntlesses of VB-3 and VS-3 and 16 Avengers of VT-8. Ramsey's force was intended to provide distant cover for the impending landings on New Georgia and to prevent intervention by any Japanese carriers. The two carriers spent some weeks familiarizing each other with their capabilities and tactics and Ramsey decided {{to take advantage of}} each carrier's strengths. He ordered that the Avengers of 832 Squadron be exchanged for 24 Wildcats from VF-3 as Victorious had difficulty operating the large Avenger and the British carrier possessed better facilities for coordinating fighter operations than Saratoga; the latter retained a dozen Wildcats for self-defense and escort duties. Fortunately, Ramsey {{never got a chance to}} test his reorganization as the Japanese carriers made no effort to attack the American transports. Ramsey was relieved on 26 July and replaced by Rear Admiral Frederick C. Sherman. Victorious sailed on 31 July for home and left eleven Avengers behind as reserves for Saratoga.|$|E
500|$|All {{five of the}} C {{class were}} {{assigned}} to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet upon commissioning during 1932. Following the Italian invasion of Abyssinia, the entire flotilla was sent to the Red Sea in August 1935 to monitor Italian warship movements until April 1936. Refitted upon their return, they were deployed to Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War in 1936–37 to intercept shipping carrying contraband goods to Spain and to protect British-flagged ships. Crescent and Cygnet were sold to the Royal Canadian Navy in 1937 and Comet and Crusader in 1938. Kempenfelt was bought in 1939, but the Royal Navy did not turn her over until enough auxiliary anti-submarine ships had been commissioned to replace her after World War II had started. All four 'C'-class ships were stationed at Esquimalt in British Columbia when the war began, but only Fraser and St. Laurent were immediately recalled to begin convoy escort duties on the Atlantic Coast, the other two following in November. Assiniboine was sent to the Caribbean for local escort duties in December where she assisted in the capture of the blockade runner [...] in March 1940. Fraser, St. Laurent, and Restigouche were transferred to the UK in late May and helped to evacuate refugees from France.
