25|$|Between I-610 and I-45 west of downtown, {{the interstate}} {{contains}} {{at least five}} main lanes in each direction. Before 2008, this section had traditionally been the widest section of I-10 in the Houston area {{and the only one}} with a significant portion below grade. A project completed in 2014 added one extra <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lane</b> in each direction between Shepherd Drive and Taylor Street. In addition, the eastbound feeder road that ends at Studemont was extended to Taylor Street. As I-10 travels through downtown, it junctions with I-45 and I-69/US59. Both interchanges feature left exits, allowing several lane shifts for through traffic. I-10 provides access to Minute Maid Park, home of the Houston Astros, and also runs through the campus of the University of Houstonâ€“Downtown.|$|E
500|$|The {{southern}} end of I-225 begins at an interchange with Interstate 25, as a typical two lane interstate with a 65mph speed limit. The road heads northeastward through southern Denver, [...] and after exits with DTC Boulevard and Yosemite Street in Greenwood Village, the road becomes three lanes with a fourth <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lane</b> traversing the Denver/Greenwood Village city limits. With Cherry Creek State Park and Cherry Creek Reservoir on its east side, the highway interchanges with State Highway 83 at the northern boundary of the park. Following the exit at SH 83, the freeway enters Aurora, where it turns northward, maintaining three through lanes, auxiliary lanes at each exit, and a 65mph speed limit to its northern terminus at I-70, and has upgraded exits at Iliff Avenue, Mississippi Avenue, Alameda Avenue, and 6th Avenue (also signed as State Highway 30). After crossing Sand Creek, the freeway interchanges with Colfax Avenue (also signed as U.S. Highway 40, U.S. Highway 287 and Interstate 70 Business), and then with 17th Place (serving the Anschutz Medical Campus). After the exit, I-225 enters Adams County, continuing through the city of Aurora. The route then crosses a railroad and continues north, where it interchanges with Interstate 70. The northbound ramp to westbound I-70 reenters Denver, and the eastbound I-70 to southbound I-225 ramp originates in Denver but enters Aurora as it passes under the westbound I-70 to southbound I-225 ramp.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} 5 mi of this highway were reconstructed in 2003-04. A {{left shoulder}} and an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lane</b> between ramps were added, {{as well as}} improved lighting. The highway is four lanes wide (not counting the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lane)</b> north of the Elgin-O'Hare Expressway / Thorndale Avenue (mile marker 5), and five lanes wide with a wide left shoulder south to the exit to I-355.|$|E
40|$|<b>Auxiliary</b> <b>lanes</b> {{can provide}} an {{improved}} weaving environment rather than a forced or direct merge or diverse for vehicles entering and departing freeway weaving segments. Considering China's traffic composition and operational status, this paper proposed safety assessment of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lanes</b> in freeway interchange weaving areas based on traffic conflict technique in order to estimate its safety impacts and related influential factors considered in design. Based on freeway interchange weaving areas data and actual traffic characteristics, simulation models were built with VISSIM. This paper used Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM) to calculate conflicts by inputting vehicle trajectories from VISSIM, analysed the influence of ramp spacing, lane number of mainline, traffic volume, weaving ratio and percentage of heavy vehicles on safety performance of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lanes</b> in freeway weaving areas. Finally, Traffic Conflict Modification Factor was presented to evaluate effectiveness of implementing <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lanes.</b> The paper found the safety impacts and related influential factors of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lanes.</b> T he findings can provide support to effective decision making with regards to constructing future <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lanes</b> in freeway interchange weaving areas...|$|R
40|$|<b>Auxiliary</b> <b>lanes</b> {{are used}} to comply with {{capacity}} demand; maintain lane balance; accommodate speed change, weaving, and maneuvering for entering and exiting traffic; and encourage carpools, vanpools, {{and the use of}} transit. For signing and delineation of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lanes,</b> see the Standard Plans, the Traffic Manual, and the MUTCD. Contact the region Traffic Engineer for guidance. Although slow-vehicle turnouts, shoulder driving for slow vehicles, and chain-up areas are not <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lanes,</b> they are covered in this chapter because they perform a similar function.

50|$|The N3 Navan Road is {{the main}} road artery. The {{interchange}} to Coolmine via <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lanes</b> between the M1 and N3 junction.|$|R
5000|$|An <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lane</b> is a lane {{other than}} a through lane, used to {{separate}} entering, exiting or turning traffic from the through traffic.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, NCDOT made an {{interchange}} improvement at I-540/I-40; {{adding another}} <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lane</b> from I-540 south to I-40 west, {{at a cost}} of $4.8 million.|$|E
5000|$|A {{transfer}} lane {{of a road}} is used to {{move from}} express lanes to collector lanes, or vice versa; it is somewhat similar to an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lane.</b>|$|E
5|$|Caltrans {{has plans}} to improve merging {{distances}} by constructing <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lanes</b> between the interchanges, and to add new interchanges at Lammers Road and Paradise Road.|$|R
50|$|The City of Las Vegas and the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada have {{previously}} {{proposed to improve}} Summerlin Parkway. Some of the proposed improvements include adding one additional lane, adding a new managed lane in each direction, adding <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lanes</b> and aesthetics improvements along the entire parkway. No timetable for these improvements was established.|$|R
50|$|In the mid 2010s, the I-69 {{portion of}} the Operation Indy Commute project did address many of the {{capacity}} issues the 2007 plan was to have corrected, by adding two new travel lanes between 82nd Street and a rebuilt split with SR 37 {{as well as by}} adding <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lanes</b> between interchanges in this same area.|$|R
5000|$|Freeway {{expansion}} to 8 lanes (2 general-purpose/1 HOV/1 <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lane</b> per side) between West Lake Sammamish Parkway and State Route 202, {{along with}} widening existing ramps between SR-202 and Avondale Road to 2 lanes.) ...|$|E
50|$|Concept A: Would {{be a new}} eight lane bridge {{including}} an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lane</b> in both directions. The center of the bridge would be 170 feet north {{of the center of}} the current bridge and would require the existing bridge to be removed. The frontage roads would merge onto the bridge and be one-way.|$|E
5000|$|An {{operational}} lane or <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lane</b> is {{an extra}} lane {{on the entire}} length of highway between interchanges, giving drivers more time to merge in or out. The lane is created when an entrance ramp meets the highway, and drops out (with an [...] "exit only" [...] sign) to become the ramp at the next exit.|$|E
50|$|Exits 89 and 90 in Lakewood will be reconstructed with {{continuous}} <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lanes.</b> In the northbound direction, the on ramp from exit 89 will be continuous to the off ramp at exit 90 {{and in the}} southbound direction, the on ramp from exit 90 will be continuous to the off ramp at exit 89. Overhead signing will {{be installed}} and the ground mounted signing will be removed.|$|R
25|$|As far as 2007, SH 358 is {{currently}} undergoing major improvements to four miles (6km) of its roadway from its interchange with SH 286 to Airline Road in Corpus Christi. The traffic volumes along South Padre Island Drive {{are at an}} all-time high with an average daily traffic count of 153,430 vehicles in 2005. The roadway construction project consists of ramp reversals and adding <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lanes</b> to the roadway.|$|R
50|$|CDOT has now {{finished}} {{construction in}} the Colorado Springs area where the 12 mile segment from Woodmen Road (exit 149) to Monument (exit 161) was expanded to six lanes and includes additional <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lanes</b> at busy interchanges. The Air Force Academy interchange (exit 156) was reconfigured to include just one exit, instead of A/B, and features two new roundabouts for North Gate Boulevard. The widening and paving was completed in December 2014.|$|R
50|$|Some {{improvements}} {{are planned for}} the near future. The HOV lanes will be extended westward from Buffalo Drive to Durango Drive, and a new westbound <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lane</b> to Rampart Boulevard are expected to open in Spring 2017. Additionally, auxiliary lanes will be constructed between the Rampart Boulevard and Town Center Drive, as well as eastbound between the CC 215 interchange and Anasazi Drive.|$|E
50|$|In 2003-04, {{the first}} 5 mi of I-290 out of Schaumburg were rebuilt, {{replacing}} pavement that had well-exceeded its estimated 20-year lifetime. (The original pavement {{was built in}} stages from 1963 through 1970 as part of IL 53.) A fifth <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lane</b> was added between the entrance and exit ramps of exits 1, 4, and 5. The most important safety upgrade was the demolition of the raised grassy median between the westbound and eastbound lanes, and its replacement with a permanent concrete median and wide shoulders.|$|E
50|$|Phase 4 status: freeway {{widening}} between Massachusetts Avenue and University Parkway. Construction {{began in}} January 2010 and {{was completed in}} November 2012. A key feature in this phase was the construction of I-215/SR 210 connector ramps. Drivers now have direct access to these freeways in all directions. In addition to a general use and carpool lane added in each direction south of the I-215/SR 210 interchange, a southbound <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lane</b> and a northbound general use lane have been added between University Parkway and the I-215/SR 210 interchange.|$|E
50|$|For {{almost all}} of its length, I-575 has two lanes in each direction, with a road median of grass, along with crepe myrtle (a locally-common {{landscaping}} tree) or wildflowers, {{both of which are}} summer-flowering. Each direction has one truck lane for climbing uphill (mile 12 to 13 northbound, mile 10 to 9 southbound), two extended acceleration lanes (north from Towne Lake Parkway and south from Marietta Highway), and two <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lanes</b> (connecting Bells Ferry and Chastain Roads).|$|R
25|$|COSMIX was {{the first}} funded portion of a larger plan for I-25 {{improvements}} as detailed in an Environmental Assessment approved by CDOT and FHWA in 2004. A second phase resulted in the widening of the 12 mile segment from Woodmen Road (exit 149) to Monument (exit 161) to six lanes and addition of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lanes</b> at busy interchanges. The Air Force Academy interchange (exit 156) was reconfigured to include just one exit, instead of A/B, and features two new roundabouts for North Gate Boulevard. The widening and paving was completed in December 2014.|$|R
500|$|At {{almost every}} interchange, {{acceleration}} and deceleration lanes would be lengthened to modern standards. [...] The ramps within the I-70 interchange would {{be modified to}} better handle traffic passing between two freeways. [...] <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>lanes</b> would be added in both directions between the US40 and MD58 interchanges, and southbound between the Showalter Road and Maugans Avenue interchanges. [...] In addition, there is an option to construct a truck weigh station somewhere along I-81 within the state; there are no weigh stations along either the Maryland or West Virginia segments of I-81.|$|R
50|$|The {{segment of}} I-580 from I-680 to I-205 is {{undergoing}} significant expansion. Among the projects along this segment is the now-completed high-occupancy vehicle lanes in each direction, a westbound <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lane</b> between Fallon Road and Tassajara Road, the now-completed {{construction of a}} new interchange at Isabel Avenue in Livermore, the reconstruction of several interchanges, the construction of additional truck climbing lanes for the eastward ascent to the Altamont Pass, and plans to preserve the right-of-way to accommodate a future BART extension in the median of the freeway.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, {{this street}} {{was part of}} a project called ''''The {{boulevard}} ring''''. During the reconstruction, some parts of the boulevard were widened and some where narrowed. The pavement was changed. Instead of a concrete, standard pavement, it was now built of smaller concrete pink and gray blocks. At the places where there are 4 lanes, the 2nd lane at both directions is a bit wider so there can be space for a vehicle to park. Most people consider this an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lane.</b> If this is correct, the boulevard would actually have six lanes.|$|E
50|$|As {{part of the}} SR 520 Bridge Replacement and HOV scheme, WSDOT {{plans to}} {{implement}} junction control through hard shoulder running. Based on traffic conditions, ATM will open the shoulder as an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lane</b> on the SR 520 westbound carriageway across Portage Bay Bridge, which will turn the motorway section from a 3 + 2 to a 3 + 3 dual carriageway. The additional capacity will allow traffic from the Montlake Boulevard junction more room to merge. The shoulder running can also be activated for incident management. A similar scheme is being developed for the I-5 northbound carriageway in Marysville.|$|E
50|$|CalTrans will be {{converting}} the existing HOV lanes on {{the entirety of}} SR 85 to High Occupancy Vehicle or Express lanes. This might add either a third regular lane from US 101 in San Jose to I-280 in Cupertino or a second express lane from SR 87 in San Jose also to I-280 in Cupertino with several <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lanes.</b> The project is expected to start in late 2018 and end before mid-2020. However, the city of Cupertino filed suit against Caltrans and VTA in May 2015 for failure to do a full Environmental Impact Report.|$|R
50|$|Likewise, INDOT has widened I-69 from I-465 on the {{northeast}} side of Indianapolis to 116th Street/SR 37 in Fishers from the original six to eight through <b>lanes,</b> with additional <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lanes</b> between interchanges. A project to add a third travel lane in the median for each direction between 116th Street/SR 37 and SR 38 near Pendleton, {{as well as to}} totally rebuild the Campus Parkway/Southeastern Parkway junction (Exit 210) as a Divergent Diamond Interchange (DDI) without necessitating its closure to traffic, began in 2016 and is scheduled for completion in late fall of 2017.|$|R
5000|$|Work is {{currently}} underway on expanding the route from east of I-41 to west of Oneida St {{from four to}} six lanes along with the upgrading of interchanges along the section. A {{large part of the}} work is completing the road's interchange with I-41 by installing the missing ramps, adding <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lanes</b> to I-41 and upgrading the Kampo Memorial Bridge. Two [...] "kinks" [...] are also being removed as part of the plan, in order to increase the speed limit on 441 to 65 mph from its current 55 mph limit.|$|R
50|$|On November 14, 2007, MoDOT {{announced}} plans for a complete replacement of the Paseo Bridge. The new Christopher S. Bond Missouri River Bridge is a dual-span cable-stayed bridge, anchored by a 260 ft tall delta-shaped pylon. The pylon rises 316 ft above the Missouri River. The new bridge increased the roadway capacity from two lanes each direction to three lanes southbound on the bridge and 4 lanes northbound on the bridge, one northbound lane being an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lane.</b> The bridge is designed to have four through lanes each way at a future date without needing to widen the bridge.|$|E
50|$|WSDOT is {{implementing}} a high occupancy toll lanes (HOT lanes) program on Interstate 405, the main bypass around Seattle. The {{first section of}} HOT lanes, between Bellevue and Lynnwood, opened on September 27, 2015, and included {{the construction of an}} <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lane</b> between Bothell and Bellevue. WSDOT proposes a 40 mi system of HOT lanes on the entire length of I-405 and nearby SR 167, with the southern half from Bellevue to Renton scheduled to be completed in 2024. A direct flyover ramp in Renton between the HOT lanes on I-405 and SR 167 began construction in 2016.|$|E
50|$|Between I-610 and I-45 west of downtown, {{the interstate}} {{contains}} {{at least five}} main lanes in each direction. Before 2008, this section had traditionally been the widest section of I-10 in the Houston area {{and the only one}} with a significant portion below grade. A project completed in 2014 added one extra <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lane</b> in each direction between Shepherd Drive and Taylor Street. In addition, the eastbound feeder road that ends at Studemont was extended to Taylor Street. As I-10 travels through downtown, it junctions with I-45 and I-69/US 59. Both interchanges feature left exits, allowing several lane shifts for through traffic. I-10 provides access to Minute Maid Park, home of the Houston Astros, and also runs through the campus of the University of Houston-Downtown.|$|E
50|$|Highway 280 {{is built}} to freeway {{standards}} from its interchange with Interstate 94 to its interchange with East Hennepin Avenue/Larpenteur Avenue, although the entrance/exit ramps at Como Avenue are rather tight. This {{section of the}} route has <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lanes</b> between University Avenue and the Kasota Avenue/Energy Park Drive exit. There is a signal-controlled intersection at Broadway Street NE on southbound 280 only. The 280/35W interchange in Roseville is incomplete, so traffic from 280 northbound cannot reach 35W southbound without using intersecting surface streets, {{and the same is}} true for northbound 35W traffic attempting to reach southbound 280.|$|R
500|$|MD228 {{begins at}} a continuous-flow {{intersection}} with MD210 (Indian Head Highway) in Accokeek. [...] Three lanes leave southbound MD210 and intersect northbound MD210. [...] A short {{distance to the}} southeast, those lanes intersect a single lane from westbound MD228 to southbound MD210; that lane intersects northbound MD210 to the northwest. [...] The two lanes from westbound MD228 seamlessly join northbound MD210, while a single lane ramp from northbound MD210 joins eastbound MD228. [...] The <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lanes</b> from the continuous-flow intersection merge into the state highway's four-lane divided profile before intersecting Manning Road East (unsigned MD810I), which serves a shopping center {{to the west and}} the historic home Bellevue to the east.|$|R
50|$|Because so much {{traffic from}} Towne Lake now uses I-575 {{to cut down}} one exit to Georgia 92 going toward Roswell and Alpharetta, GDOT {{connected}} the exit and entrance ramps of the two as <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lanes</b> in 2007, so that drivers {{would not have to}} merge into the two existing lanes. This significantly improved traffic at rush hour, though no attempt has been made to replant trees on the now-steep hillsides it created. Improvements were also made on Towne Lake Parkway under the freeway, allowing westbound drivers two left-turn lanes to enter the freeway southbound, and removed north bound turn lane on the west bound side, among other upgrades.|$|R
