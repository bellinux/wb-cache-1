In 2014, Brady et al. synonymized the <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> subfamilies and their closest relatives under Dorylinae; this clade, the dorylomorph subfamilies, previously also contained Aenictinae, Aenictogitoninae, Cerapachyinae, Ecitoninae and Leptanilloidinae.|$|E
5|$|This rockfowl feeds {{primarily}} on insects, though some plant matter, such as fruit and flower buds, is eaten. One feeding strategy involves following Dorylus <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> swarms, feeding on insects flushed by the ants. Rockfowl {{move through the}} forest mainly {{through a series of}} hops and bounds, or short flights in low vegetation. It travels either alone or in small groups. This species rarely flies for long distances. The grey-necked rockfowl is monogamous and pairs nest either alone or in the vicinity of other pairs, sometimes in colonies of two to five nests, though one colony of forty nests has been recorded. These nests are constructed out of mud and are formed into a deep cup that is built on rock surfaces, typically in caves or on cliffs. Two eggs are laid twice a year. Though the birds breed in colonies, infanticide exists in this species, with rockfowl attempting to kill the young of other pairs. Nestlings mature in about a month.|$|E

40|$|The {{most widely}} used {{algorithm}} for Monte Carlo sampling of electronic transitions in trajectory surface hopping (TSH) calculations is the so-called anteater algorithm, which is inefficient for sampling low-probability nonadiabatic events. We present a new sampling scheme (called the <b>army</b> <b>ants</b> algorithm) for carrying out TSH calculations that is applicable to systems with any strength of coupling. The <b>army</b> <b>ants</b> algorithm {{is a form of}} rare event sampling whose efficiency is controlled by an input parameter. By choosing a suitable value of the input parameter the <b>army</b> <b>ants</b> algorithm can be reduced to the anteater algorithm (which is efficient for strongly coupled cases), and by optimizing the parameter the <b>army</b> <b>ants</b> algorithm may be efficiently applied to systems with low-probability events. To demonstrate the efficiency of the <b>army</b> <b>ants</b> algorithm, we performed atom-diatom scattering calculations on a model system involving weakly coupled electronic states. Fully converged quantum mechanical calculations were performed, and the probabilities for nonadiabatic reaction and nonreactive de-excitation (quenching) were found to be on the order of 10 − 8. For such low-probability events the anteater sampling scheme requires a large number of trajectories (~ 10 10) to obtain good statistics and converged semiclassical results. In contrast by using the new <b>army</b> <b>ants</b> algorithm converged results were obtained by running 10 5 trajectories. Furthermore, the results were found to be in excellent agreement with the quantum mechanical results.

5|$|Insects {{have been}} used medicinally in {{cultures}} around the world, often according to the Doctrine of Signatures. Thus, the femurs of grasshoppers, which were said to resemble the human liver, were used to treat liver ailments by the indigenous peoples of Mexico. The doctrine was applied in both Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and in Ayurveda. TCM uses arthropods for various purposes; for example, centipede is used to treat tetanus, seizures, and convulsions, while the Chinese Black Mountain Ant, Polyrhachis vicina, {{is used as a}} cure all, especially by the elderly, and extracts have been examined as a possible anti-cancer agent. Ayurveda uses insects such as Termite for conditions such as ulcers, rheumatic diseases, anaemia, and pain. The Jatropha leaf miner's larvae are used boiled to induce lactation, reduce fever, and soothe the gastrointestinal tract. In contrast, the traditional insect medicine of Africa is local and unformalised. The indigenous peoples of Central America used a wide variety of insects medicinally. Mayans used <b>Army</b> <b>ant</b> soldiers as living sutures. The venom of the Red harvester ant was used to cure rheumatism, arthritis, and poliomyelitis via the immune reaction produced by its sting. Boiled silkworm pupae were taken to treat apoplexy, aphasy, bronchitis, pneumonia, convulsions, haemorrhages, and frequent urination.|$|E
25|$|Many {{species of}} <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> are widely {{considered}} to be keystone species, due to {{the high number of}} vertebrate and invertebrate associates that rely on <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> colonies for nutrition or protection. During their hunt, many surface-raiding army ants are accompanied by various birds, such as antbirds, thrushes, ovenbirds and wrens, which devour the insects that are flushed out by the ants, a behavior known as cleptoparasitism. A wide variety of arthropods including staphylinid beetles and mites also follow colonies.

25|$|S. septentrionalis is preyed upon by {{numerous}} species. This is {{largely because of}} the fact that it resides at an elevation of 300 meters above sea level, a lower elevation than most paper wasps. Specifically, army ants will regularly feed on them along with other species of paper wasps. This prevalent predation has resulted in S. septentrionalis making numerous adaptations, some of which include forming a complex nest structure, choosing a nest-site that reduces exposure to predators, and establishing defensive mechanisms. S. septentrionalis has also been known to defend against army ants by piling their bodies up against the nest entrance. However, <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> predation can be extreme enough to regulate the density of a colony and keep populations of S. septentrionalis and other species of paper wasps regulated.|$|E
25|$|Most ant {{species will}} send {{individual}} scouts to find food sources and later recruit {{others from the}} colony to help; however, army ants dispatch a cooperative, leaderless group of foragers to detect and overwhelm the prey at once. Army ants {{do not have a}} permanent nest but instead form many bivouacs as they travel. The constant traveling is due to the need to hunt large amounts of prey to feed its enormous colony population. Their queens are wingless and have abdomens that expand significantly during egg production. This allows for the production of 3-4 million eggs every month and often results in synchronized brood cycles, thus each colony will be formed of millions of individuals that descend from a single queen. All three of these traits are found to be in all <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> species and the defining traits of army ants.|$|E
40|$|<b>Army</b> <b>Ants</b> are {{probably}} best known to {{people because of}} their ability to swarm and raid potential food source areas.

500|$|Swarms of army ants are an {{important}} resource used by some species of antbird, and the one from which the family's common name is derived. Many species of tropical ant form large raiding swarms, but the swarms are often nocturnal or raid underground. While birds visit these swarms when they occur, the species most commonly attended by birds is the Neotropical species Eciton burchellii, which is both diurnal and surface-raiding. It was once thought that attending birds were actually eating the ants, but numerous studies {{in various parts of}} Eciton burchellii's range has shown that the ants act as beaters, flushing insects, other arthropods and small vertebrates into the waiting flocks of [...] "ant followers". The improvement in foraging efficiency can be dramatic; a study of spotted antbirds found that they made attempts at prey every 111.8 seconds away from ants, but at swarms they made attempts every 32.3 seconds. While many species of antbirds (and other families) may opportunistically feed at <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> swarms, 18 species of antbird are obligate ant-followers, obtaining most of their diet from swarms. With only three exceptions, these species never regularly forage away from ant swarms. A further four species regularly attend swarms but are as often seen away from them. Obligate ant-followers visit the nesting bivouacs of army ants in the morning to check for raiding activities; other species do not. These species tend to arrive at swarms first, and their calls are used by other species to locate swarming ants.|$|E
2500|$|Being {{the largest}} ants on Earth, army ants, such as African Dorylus queens have the {{greatest}} reproductive potential among the insects, with an egg-laying capacity of several millions per month. <b>Army</b> <b>ant</b> queens never {{have to leave the}} protection of the colony, where they mate with foreign incoming males which disperse on nuptial flights.
