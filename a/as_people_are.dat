Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. <b>As</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals {{are more likely to}} overestimate what their audience comprehends.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{redevelopment}} of Hampden {{was completed in}} 1999, the capacity for sporting events is now limited to 52,063. Attendances for concerts can be higher than this <b>as</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> allowed onto the pitch area. In 2009, more people attended concerts at Hampden than football matches. Hampden regularly has crowds of below 1,000 for Queen's Park matches in the lower divisions of the Scottish football league system. Queen's Park have not played in the top division of Scottish football since 1958.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the causes}} of {{deliberate}} self-poisoning in Sri Lankan adolescents included bereavement and harsh discipline by parents. The coping mechanisms are being spread in local communities <b>as</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> surrounded by others who have previously deliberately harmed themselves or attempted suicide. One way of reducing self-harm would be to limit access to poisons; however many cases involve pesticides or yellow oleander seeds, and the reduction of access to these agents would be difficult. Great potential for the reduction of self-harm lies in education and prevention, but limited resources in the developing world make these methods challenging.|$|E

5|$|Life in Nsara (and all the Muslim nations) becomes {{increasingly}} difficult as {{they face the}} effects of defeat in the war. Since casualties were so massive, {{there is a great}} shortage of men over women and many men who survived the fighting returned as disabled veterans (Budur volunteers to help veterans blinded by gas at a hospital by reading to them). The Muslims were forced to pay reparations to the victorious countries and to make various humiliating concessions such as allowing Buddhist monasteries to open in their cities. There is a general depression and malaise in post-war Muslim society, made worse by the economic difficulties; hyperinflation, food shortages and strikes. In many counties this leads to governments being overthrown in coups of various kinds. In Nsara itself, order begins to break down <b>as</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> near starvation and the military attempts to overthrow the government and impose a police state. However many liberals, including Budur and Kirana start mass street protests against this reactionary dictatorship. Eventually the Hodenosaunee League (who have become very powerful after their victory in the war) intervene by sending a fleet (from their naval base at Orkney) to Nsara, insisting that the military relinquish power, which they do. After this, things slowly start to improve, but most of the Muslim states continue to suffer grave problems. Even in China, a victorious country, there is unrest which turns into a civil war.|$|E

25|$|Thrombosis prevention, {{also known}} as {{thrombosis}} prophylaxis, are treatments to prevent the formation of blood clots inside a blood vessel. Some people are at a higher risk {{for the formation of}} blood clots than others. Prevention measures or interventions are usually begun after surgery <b>as</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> at higher risk due to immobility. There are medication-based interventions and non-medication-based interventions. The risk of developing blood clots can be modified by life style modifications, the discontinuation of oral contraceptives, and weight loss. In those at high risk both interventions are often used. The treatments to prevent the formation of blood clots is balanced against the risk of bleeding.|$|E
25|$|Bulimia is {{more common}} {{among those who have}} a close {{relative}} with the condition. The percentage risk that is estimated to be due to genetics is between 30% and 80%. Other risk factors for the disease include psychological stress, cultural pressure to attain a certain body type, poor self-esteem, and obesity. Living in a culture that promotes dieting and having parents that worry about weight are also risks. Diagnosis is based on a person's medical history, however this is difficult <b>as</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> usually secretive about their binge eating and purging habits. Furthermore, the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa takes precedence over that of bulimia. Other similar disorders include binge eating disorder, Kleine-Levin syndrome, and borderline personality disorder.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{physical}} health {{factors associated with}} developmental disabilities. For some specific syndromes and diagnoses, these are inherent, such as poor heart function in people with Down syndrome. People with severe communication difficulties {{find it difficult to}} articulate their health needs, and without adequate support and education might not recognize ill health. Epilepsy, sensory problems (such as poor vision and hearing), obesity and poor dental health are over-represented in this population. Life expectancy among people with developmental disabilities as a group is estimated at 20 years below average, although this is improving with advancements in adaptive and medical technologies, and <b>as</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> leading healthier, more fulfilling lives, and some conditions (such as Freeman-Sheldon syndrome) do not impact life expectancy.|$|E

500|$|Different {{groups of}} people have responded to feminism, and {{both men and women}} have been among its {{supporters}} and critics. Among American university students, for both men and women, support for feminist ideas is more common than self-identification as a feminist. The US media tends to portray feminism negatively and feminists [...] "are less often associated with day-to-day work/leisure activities of regular women." [...] However, as recent research has demonstrated, <b>as</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> exposed to self-identified feminists and to discussions relating to various forms of feminism, their own self-identification with feminism increases. Roy Baumeister has criticized feminists who [...] "look only at the top of society and draw conclusions about society as a whole. Yes, there are mostly men at the top.

[...] Writer Damon Lindelof declared that Khan's [...] "intense gravity," [...] particularly regarding the character's delivery of monologues, made him an obligatory character to use, even if its iconic status made the crew afraid of the fan reaction. Lindelof jokingly stated that [...] "it was never really a 'Should we or shouldn't we?' as much as it was 'We really have to do this but if we don't get it right people are going to kill us.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Stanton {{wanted the}} Axioms {{interior}} to resemble Shanghai and Dubai. Eggleston studied 1960s NASA paintings {{and the original}} concept art for Tomorrowland for the Axiom, to reflect that era's sense of optimism. Stanton remarked [...] "We are all probably very similar in our backgrounds here [...] in that we all miss the Tomorrowland that was promised us from the heyday of Disneyland," [...] and wanted a [...] "jet pack" [...] feel. Pixar also studied the Disney Cruise Line and visited Las Vegas, which was helpful in understanding artificial lighting. Eggleston based his Axiom designs on the futuristic architecture of Santiago Calatrava. Eggleston divided {{the inside of the}} ship into three sections; the rear's economy class has a basic gray concrete texture with graphics keeping to the red, blue, and white of the BnL logo. The coach class with living/shopping spaces has [...] "S" [...] shapes <b>as</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> always looking for [...] "what's around the corner". Stanton intended to have many colorful signs, but he realized this would overwhelm the audience and went with Eggleston's original idea of a small number of larger signs. The premier class is a large Zen-like spa with colors limited to turquoise, cream, and tan, and leads on to the captain's warm carpeted and wooded quarters and the sleek dark bridge. In keeping with the artificial Axiom, camera movements were modeled after those of the steadicam.|$|E
