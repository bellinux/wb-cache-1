40|$|LUCAS (Land Use/Cover <b>Area</b> <b>frame</b> Survey) {{has been}} {{launched}} by the European Union (EU) in 2001 based on an <b>area</b> <b>frame</b> of points with a two-stage systematic sampling. We discuss some possible options to improve LUCAS assuming that it could combine in the future an annual survey focused on arable land with a general purpose survey. A test is being carried in Greece out with a two-phase <b>area</b> <b>frame</b> of unclustered points, following the current approach of the Italian AGRIT survey. The high share of the variance coming from the first sasmpling stage suggests that unclustered points can be better. The same conclusion is reached considering the “equivalent number of points of a Primary Sampling Unit”. A simulation shows that a stratification based on photo-interpretation is much more efficient with unclustered points (single stage sampling) than with the current two-stage design if the photo-interpretation is very accurate. The gain is debatable with a moderate amount of photo-interpretation errors. A remark is made showing that the current LUCAS two-stage sampling scheme {{can be seen as}} a single-stage systematic sampling, which simplifies the estimation of variances <b>Area</b> <b>frame</b> surveys of points: two-stage versus two-phase schemes.

The Census Bureau is currently conducting evaluations to support the goal of using a MAF-based frame to replace the current multiple frames for the 2010 Demographic Survey Redesign. The current frames include a unit frame, a group quarters (GQ) frame, a permit frame, and an <b>area</b> <b>frame.</b> The unit frame and the GQ frame cover addresses of housing units and group quarters that existed {{during the time of}} Census 2000 in blocks that had a high percent complete addresses, i. e., addresses that had a house number, a street name, and a zip code, and had building permit coverage. The permit frame obtains addresses from building permit offices (BPOs) to capture new construction after Census 2000 in blocks that had building permit coverage. For the remaining universe that is primarily in rural areas, an <b>area</b> <b>frame</b> approach is used. The current <b>area</b> <b>frame</b> covers approximately 12 % of the addresses in the U. S.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Matching has a {{long history}} of uses in {{statistical}} surveys and administrative data development. A business register consisting of names, addresses, and other identifying information such as total financial receipts might be constructed from tax and employment data bases (see chapters by Colledge, Nijhowne, and Archer). A survey of retail establishments or agricultural establishments might combine results from an <b>area</b> <b>frame</b> and a list frame. To produce a combined estimator, units from the <b>area</b> <b>frame</b> would need to be identified in the list frame (see Vogel-Kott chapter). To estimate the size of a (sub) population via capture-recapture techniques, one needs to accurately determine units common to two or more independent listings (Sekar and Deming 1949; Scheuren 1983; Winkler 1989 b). Samples must be drawn appropriately to estimate overlap (Deming and Gleser 1959). Rather than develop a special survey to collect data for policy decisions, it might be more appropriate...|$|E
40|$|Monitoring {{the number}} of animals in any {{wildlife}} population is an important task. Studying the bald eagle population is particularly worthwhile {{for a variety of}} reasons. In addition to being our national symbol and having threatened status under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, bald eagles serve as good indicators of environmental health. To estimate {{the number of}} bald eagles in a specific area, we recommend the implementation ofa dual frame sampling technique widely used in agricultural surveys by the U. S. Department of Agriculture. This methodology combines an incomplete list frame with an <b>area</b> <b>frame</b> that is assumed to be complete. A key assumption in this scenario is that the list and <b>area</b> <b>frame</b> sampling schemes are independent. Hartley's "screening " estimator is used to combine sample information from both frames. The quantities estimated include both the number of active and successful nests along with their standard errors. The properties and advantages of the dual frame method are discussed. Finally, an example illustrating the methodology is presented...|$|E
40|$|<b>Area</b> <b>frame</b> {{sampling}} {{for agricultural}} statistics is a procedure currently {{used by the}} Statistical Reporting Service of the US Department of Agriculture {{as well as by}} agriculture departments in other countries. A primary advantage of the <b>area</b> <b>frame</b> is that it provides complete coverage of the population. In <b>area</b> <b>frame</b> sampling the total area is divided into segments of land that form the sampling units. These segments are delineated by the use of detailed maps and aerial photography. The reporting units, however, are not the segments but are the farms. Since there will be many cases where farms overlap the boundaries of the segments, there have to be rules for assigning data from the farms to the sample segments. Previously used procedures for making this assignment are the open segment method, where the total farm value is assigned to the segment that contains the farm headquarters, the closed segment method, where the actual value associated with the tracts of land contained within the segment is used, and the weighted segment method, where the total farm value is weighted by the proportion of the farm area that is contained in the segment. In this thesis, a general linear unbiased estimator is formulated that includes all previously used methods as special cases. These methods are compared in terms of variance and cost. The optimal estimator depends on the amount and type of overlap of farms with segment boundaries, so {{it is not possible to}} give an estimator that is always to be preferred. However, comparisons are made under some special assumptions that, while not particularly realistic, do give insight into conditions affecting the methods and show that the multiplicity rule is an important method to consider...|$|E
