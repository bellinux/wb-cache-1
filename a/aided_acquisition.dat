The method used for designing DPLL {{is based on}} linear control theory and the receiver is phase locked at higher radio frequency signal which is highly noisy. The building blocks of DPLL such as loop filter are implemented with a new method in digital domain for better noise rejection and accuracy. The paper aims to offer <b>aided</b> <b>acquisition</b> of RF signal with fast frequency and phase locking. The designed DPLL is used for higher frequency range applications {{of the order of}} GHz and theoretically expected frequency response graph of the filter is verified practically.

40|$|A two-element laser {{phased array}} is {{implemented}} where two commercially available DFB lasers are phase locked to a reference laser using two heterodyne Electro-Optical Phase Locked Loops (EOPLL) with integrated CMOS electronics. Integrated frequency <b>aided</b> <b>acquisition</b> system increases the acquisition range of EOPLLs from 8 MHz to 980 MHz, improving the phase locking performance in presence of environment fluctuations. The phase of each laser {{is controlled by}} phase shifting of the radio frequency signal outside the PLLs, eliminating optical phase shifters. An external feedback loop using a voltage controlled oscillator is realized {{to compensate for the}} relative phase fluctuations between the output of locked lasers at the point of beam combining. By electronically adjusting the relative phase between lasers, beam steering over more than 1 mrad at the far field (corresponding to 1 mm beam spot displacement at one meter away from the phased array emitters) has been demonstrated. Use of integrated electronics enables realization of laser phased arrays with large number of elements...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a CMOS PLL circuit {{realised}} for clock and data recovery in interconnection systems is presented. The {{purpose of this}} clock recovery PLL is to generate a clock with frequency and phase locked to the input NRZ data, in order to sample them in the optimum point. The topology of the circuit is characterised by two loops, one for the phase lock, the second for a frequency <b>aided</b> <b>acquisition</b> system. A full custom approach {{has been used in}} the PLL implementation to obtain an high operation speed. Its compact implementation allows the PLL blocks to be included in different CMOS ICs as library elements. An operating range of 150 - 550 Mbit/s has been obtained. 1.

40|$|For ultra-wideband (UWB) communications, {{acquisition}} is challenging. The {{reason is}} from the ultra short pulse shape and ultra dense multipath interference. Ultra short pulse indicates the acquisition region is very narrow. Sampling is another challenge for UWB design due {{to the need for}} ultra high speed analog-to digital converter. A sub-optimum and under-sampling scheme using pilot codes as transmitted reference is proposed here for acquisition. The sampling rate for the receiver is at the symbol rate. A new architecture, the reference aided matched filter is studied in this project. The reference aided matched filter method avoids using complex rake receiver to estimate channel parameters and high sampling rate for interpolation. A limited number of matched filters are used as a filter bank to search for the strongest path. Timing offset for acquisition is then estimated and passed to an advanced verification algorithm. For optimum performance of acquisition, the adaptive post detection integration is proposed to solve the problem from dense inter-symbol interference during the acquisition. A low-complex early-late gate tracking loop is one element of the adaptive post detection integration. This tracking scheme assists in improving acquisition accuracy. The proposed scheme is evaluated using Matlab Simulink simulations in term of mean acquisition time, system performance and false alarm. Simulation results show proposed algorithm is very effective in ultra dense multipath channels. This research proves reference <b>aided</b> <b>acquisition</b> with tracking loop is promising in UWB application...|$|E
30|$|This paper aims {{to explain}} survey {{findings}} regarding disaster recovery processes among {{ethnic groups in}} a rural Texas community. The research was conducted over a 4 -year period {{with most of the}} survey data collected over the summer of 2004. The research was descriptive in nature, attempting to document processes and sources of recovery <b>aid</b> <b>acquisition</b> following a natural disaster, and viewed through the lens of cultural and ethnic literature regarding minorities and disaster recovery processes. The difficulty in explaining research findings {{comes from the fact that}} data was collected at the household level, yet the explanations which best elucidate the findings are derived from a different level of analysis than that of the survey. The variation in <b>aid</b> <b>acquisition</b> between ethnic groups is best understood as a manifestation of community cultural norms, which implies both individual, cognitive norms, as well as social norms. Ethnic literature focused on minorities in disaster situations, excerpts from qualitative data, and personal observations are used to support the interpretation of the data presented herein pointing to cultural flexibility in recovery processes, which are stifled by institutional barriers hampering recovery efficiencies.|$|R
30|$|In the end, 95 % of all flood victims {{from each}} ethnic group {{received}} {{some type of}} housing restoration aid (this includes temporary housing and replacing belongings). Less than 5 %, from each ethnic group, reported not receiving any aid, from any source. However, when supplementing the qualitative data, and local, social dynamics of the recovery process into context, one can better understand the ethnic variations in significant differences for access to permanent housing aid. Many of the ethnic differences in <b>aid</b> <b>acquisition,</b> and particularly permanent housing assistance, were obfuscated {{by a lack of}} previous research, knowledge of the complex federal system, funding complexities, and local socio-cultural challenges in housing reconstruction, which resulted in poor data categorization inhibiting a more parsed statistical analysis of the housing recovery processes. Since all ethnic groups broke with “culturally documented patterns” for their ethnicity, it shows that disasters can nullify the effect of ethnic cultural trends in the <b>aid</b> <b>acquisition</b> process. This is especially true in situations where the ethnic groups are somewhat isolated from others with the same cultural patterns, and/or there are few if any internal horizontal ties between groups (Wenger 1978).|$|R
30|$|All {{ethnic groups}} broke with “culturally documented” and {{expected}} patterns of <b>aid</b> <b>acquisition</b> for their respective groups, but social inequalities in assistance and recovery persisted, essentially creating ever {{higher levels of}} vulnerability. The biggest problem lies within the power differentials that are established along ethnic and cultural lines creating a de facto caste system and institutionalizing cultural cleavages. These problems and barriers to <b>aid</b> <b>acquisition</b> and community solidarity foretold similar social dynamics found during the Hurricane Katrina recovery processes that related directly to implicit and explicit occurrences of institutional discrimination (Henkel et al. 2006; Cutter et al. 2006; Tootle 2007). These power differentials deter multifaceted relationship between groups, which would allow trust to grow (Lindell and Perry 2004). Wenger (1978) noted {{that one of the}} key determinants to community resiliency was the establishment and nurturing of horizontal ties or relationship with other groups at similar organizational levels. The truism of “strength in numbers” that can be applied to any level of social analysis, including households. The human tendency to seek similar and like-minded others can increase vulnerabilities if one’s group is too small, or too isolated.|$|R

30|$|The {{setting for}} this {{research}} presented an opportunity in which to compare behavioral variations {{as they relate to}} resource acquisition for housing recovery among ethnic groups within a rural community. In American society, the process of recovery is normally a function of local market forces, and is given its impetus through the capitalistic systems of insurance, savings, and governmental loans (Scanlon 1992). However, when these forces are inadequate or nonexistent, housing recovery must take place through other means. Rural communities often lack the resources to adequately engage market forces for recovery, and thus this community provided a unique opportunity to gauge the effects of culture in the recovery process (Miller and Simile 1992; Rubin 1985). Their smaller size enable a manageable format for data acquisition at the household or individual levels, while still capturing a holistic sense of social dynamics. In addition, rural communities, often, are not able to garner as much media support and attention, and the concomitant influx of resources that is often bestowed on larger urban centers when major disasters strike; thus, negating some convergence effects. In particular, this research will focus on ethnic differences in aid sources accessed by households for permanent housing recovery, to determine if the previously described cultural patterns for <b>aid</b> <b>acquisition</b> were a determining factor in their recovery. The hypotheses for permanent housing, <b>aid</b> <b>acquisition</b> was that Anglos would receive aid from fewer sources than minorities, because they would access individualized, formal systems (i.e., insurance and loans) that could provide greater assistance, and therefore, would not need to depend on informal social networks. This hypothesis is based on research literature that shows most Anglos have tended to rely on insurance and personal savings for recovery, which were often not sufficiently developed to be of extensive aid for minorities (Bolin and Bolton 1986; Bolin 1986; Bolin 2006). Previous research, also, has shown that minority households are likely to have inadequate insurance, and simultaneously more likely to be depend on social networks for recovery assistance (Bolin 1986; Perry and Mushkatel 1986; Oliver-Smith 1990; Peacock and Girard 1997).|$|R

He suggests that translation be added to the traditional list of four skills: reading, writing, listening, and speaking—and translating. It is further argued that apart from its role in <b>aiding</b> <b>acquisition,</b> translation has a political role to play in society: the use of translation emphasizes the equality of languages and opens people to ideas and values other than their own.
