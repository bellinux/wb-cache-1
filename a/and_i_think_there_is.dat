It survived three {{major changes in}} narrative approach, three different executive producers, and various attempts to axe the entire project. By the time it aired, {{all of the people}} interviewed for their anecdotes of World War I had died. Jennings, though, downplayed criticism of the program's rocky history. [...] "Name me a news organization that doesn't have some degree of turmoil on a major project," [...] he said. [...] "What people care about in The New York Times is what gets in the paper. It's the same with us. There {{are people out there who}} think their job is to set the bar for us, but the bar for me is set by the audience, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a real hunger out there from everyone I encounter to relive and experience and learn from what's gone on over the last 100 years." ...|$|E
500|$|Fink {{does not}} know how long her {{character}} will be featured on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: [...] "I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and she knows what she wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rep. Coutu stated, [...] "... {{the unions}} {{are the first}} ones to say, 'just let us vote' and today, for some reason, they won't let these good people vote <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{something}} wrong with that. You can't have it both ways." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 1971 {{conference at}} Columbia University, Borges {{was asked about}} the story by a student from the {{creative}} writing program. He recalled, [...] "When the Germans were defeated I felt great joy and relief, {{but at the same time}} I thought of the German defeat as being somehow tragic, because here we have perhaps the most educated people in Europe, [...] who have a fine literature, a fine tradition of philosophy and poetry. Yet these people were bamboozled by a madman named Adolf Hitler, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> tragedy there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Doc at the Radar Station (1980) helped {{establish}} Beefheart's late resurgence. Released by Virgin Records during the post-punk scene, {{the music was}} now accessible to a younger, more receptive audience. He was interviewed in a feature report on KABC-TV's Channel 7 Eyewitness News {{in which he was}} hailed as [...] "the father of the new wave. One of the most important American composers of the last fifty years, [...] a primitive genius"; Van Vliet said at this period, [...] "I'm doing a non-hypnotic music to break up the catatonic state... <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> one right now." [...] Huey of Allmusic cited the Doc at the Radar Station as being [...] "...generally acclaimed as the strongest album of his comeback, and by some as his best since Trout Mask Replica", [...] "even if the Captain's voice isn't quite what it once was, Doc at the Radar Station is an excellent, focused consolidation of Beefheart's past and then-present". Van Vliet's biographer Mike Barnes speaks of [...] "revamping work built on skeletal ideas and fragments that would have mouldered away in the vaults had they not been exhumed and transformed into full-blown, totally convincing new material". During this period, Van Vliet made two appearances on David Letterman's late night television program on NBC, and also performed on Saturday Night Live.|$|E

5000|$|... “The {{basic idea}} {{now is to}} avoid being {{isolated}} and to build broad-based support on the university level, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> has been some success in doing that,” Hamid added.|$|R
6000|$|... "Eh, Mr. Fenwick! Bad news? 'Deed <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there's</b> {{but little}} good news left to us now,--little {{that comes from}} the tongues of men. It's bad news that is always coming here. Mr. Fenwick,--what is it, sir?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{for those}} who work in it; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> will be {{something}} {{coming out of it}} for Sarah,--something, but it will be very small. And if so, she must depend for it solely on Mr Rubb." ...|$|R

60|$|In {{regard to}} the Western matter, I believe the program will have to stand {{substantially}} as I first put it. Henderson, and especially Brown, believe that the social influence of St. Louis would inevitably tell injuriously upon General Pope in the particular difficulty existing there, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> some force in that view.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not doubt}} {{you are going}} to have a rougher voyage than usual this time, young masters," [...] John Lirriper said when the boat was {{approaching}} Bricklesey. [...] "The sky looks wild, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> going to be a break in the weather. However, the Susan is a stout boat, and my nephew a careful navigator." ...|$|E
5000|$|Broomfield {{told the}} BBC that he professes irreligion. He said, [...] "I believe that there's a {{goodness}} out <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there's</b> goodness in everybody. We should probably all try {{and have a}} good dig around and find out where it is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{regard to}} my own interest. If I did not do so, I should soon make people unwilling to lend me their things. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> must be some good reason why James {{is not willing to}} lend you his knife." ...|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the season}} finale aired, Adelstein said in a TV Guide article that, [...] "There's a cliff-hanger to Kellerman's story line in the finale, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> will be some passionate {{discussion}} about exactly what happened. It's not really ambiguous, but it's still open to various interpretations." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are right, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{someone on}} it," [...] said Mulroy. [...] "I see {{something}} like a man lying on it, but whether he is dead or alive I cannot say. There is a flag, undoubtedly--but no one waves a handkerchief or a rag of any kind. Surely, if a living being occupied the raft he {{would have seen the}} ship by this time. Stay, he moves! No; it must have been imagination. I fear that he is dead, poor fellow. Stand by to lower a boat." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{no thought}} so much {{calculated}} {{to make one}} doubt death itself, to feel that sublime doubt which has created all religion--the doubt that found death incredible. Edwin Drood {{may or may not}} have really died; but surely Dickens did not really die. Surely our real detective liveth and shall appear in the latter days of the earth. For a finished tale may give a man immortality in the light and literary sense; but an unfinished tale suggests another immortality, more essential and more strange.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I must go, my dear. I have {{no desire}} to be shot, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> much more fear of my being shot, if I don't answer to the call of my name than there will be if I do. In the first place, we may not go out beyond the wall, in the second place, if there is I may see a chance of running away, for mind you, though I hope I should have fought as bravely as others if the Germans had come, I do not feel myself called upon to fight against Frenchmen and in a cause I hate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Mr. Farquhar,” she said, “even in {{this country}} {{it is hard for}} a man to stand alone, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> are times when one is {{justified}} in taking a favor from one’s friends. Now, you were very kind on board the Empress, and I’m sure my father—” ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> that he {{committed}} suicide. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>there's</b> a smoking gun. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there's</b> {{only one way}} you can explain {{a lot of things}} around his death. Not that he was murdered, but that there was just a lack of caring for him. <b>I</b> just <b>think</b> that Courtney had moved on, and he was expendable.|$|R
5000|$|Regarding the {{influences}} of China's political upheavals on his paintings, Zhang said, [...] "For me, the Cultural Revolution is a psychological state, not a historical fact. It has a very strict connection with my childhood, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> are many things linking {{the psychology of the}} Chinese people today with the psychology of the Chinese people back then." ...|$|R
6000|$|Various {{were the}} speculations at head-quarters on the sudden {{movement}} of the enemy. Washington writes to General William Livingston (now governor of the Jerseys): [...] "They have gone towards the North River and King's Bridge. Some suppose they are going into winter quarters, and will sit down in New York without doing more than investing Fort Washington. I cannot subscribe wholly to this opinion myself. That they will invest Fort Washington, {{is a matter of}} which there can be no doubt; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a strong probability that General Howe will detach a part of his force to make an incursion into the Jerseys, provided he is going to New York. He must attempt something on account of his reputation, for what has he done as yet with his great army?" ...|$|E
60|$|June 20.--My {{course is}} still the same. But I have a painful letter from Lockhart, which takes away the last hope of poor Johnnie's recovery. It is no {{surprise}} to me. The poor child, so amiable in its disposition, and so promising from its talents, was not formed to be long with us, and I have long expected that it must needs come to this. I hope I shall not outlive my children in other cases, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> little chance of it. My father did not long survive the threescore and ten; it will be wonderful if I reach that goal of ordinary mortality. God send it may find me prepared; and, whatever I may have been formerly, high spirits are not now like to carry me away.|$|E
60|$|General McClellan is not dangerously ill, as I hope, {{but would}} {{better not be}} {{disturbed}} with business. I am very anxious that, in case of General Buell's moving toward Nashville, the enemy shall not be greatly reinforced, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> danger he will be from Columbus. It {{seems to me that}} a real or feigned attack upon Columbus from up the river at the same time would either prevent this or compensate for it by throwing Columbus into our hands. I wrote General Buell a letter similar to this, meaning that he and you shall communicate and act in concert, unless it be your judgment and his that there is no necessity for it. You and he will understand much better than I how to do it. Please do not lose time in this matter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] she said, [...] "there {{were little}} courtesies shown us at Las Palmas, {{things that made}} our stay <b>there</b> pleasanter, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> was, perhaps, no great reason why you should have done them for my father." [...] Then her eyes twinkled. [...] "I {{am not sure that}} all your friends were very pleased with you." ...|$|R
500|$|Speaking in the 1990s, Harrison {{said of the}} Bangladesh relief effort: [...] "Now it's all {{settled and}} the UN own the rights to it themselves, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there's</b> been about 45 million dollars made." [...] Sales of the DVD and CD of the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh {{continue}} to benefit the cause, {{now known as the}} George Harrison Fund for UNICEF.|$|R
60|$|God forbid {{this should}} be true; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> needs very little to be said in answer to it. I can answer for myself, that it is {{notoriously}} false; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the easy <b>and</b> uninterrupted accession of his majesty to the crown contradicts it. I see no end which such a suggestion aims at, but to leave an odium upon all that had any duty or regard to her late majesty.|$|R
6000|$|I {{get along}} with my papers for Scribner not fast, nor so far {{specially}} well; only this last, the fourth one (which makes a third part of my whole task), I do believe is pulled off after a fashion. It is a mere sermon: [...] "Smith opens out";[24] but it is true, and I find it touching and beneficial, to me at least; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> some fine writing in it, some very apt and pregnant phrases. Pulvis et Umbra, I call it; I might have called it a Darwinian Sermon, if I had wanted. Its sentiments, although parsonic, will not offend even you, I believe. The other three papers, I fear, bear many traces of effort, and the ungenuine inspiration of an income at so much per essay, and the honest desire of the incomer to give good measure for his money. Well, I did my damndest anyway.|$|E
60|$|But {{gradually}} {{with that}} increase of activity which {{we see on}} ascending to successively higher grades of animals, and especially with that increased complexity of life which we also see, there came more and more into play as a factor, the inheritance of those modifications of structure caused by modifications of function. Eventually, among creatures of high organization, this factor became an important one; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> reason to conclude that, {{in the case of}} the highest of creatures, civilized men, among whom the kinds of variation which affect survival are too multitudinous to permit easy selection of any one, and among whom survival of the fittest is greatly interfered with, it has become the chief factor: such aid as survival of the fittest gives, being usually limited to the preservation of those in whom the totality of the faculties has been most favourably moulded by functional changes.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} love {{a man who}} is ridiculous," [...] said Mary, not {{choosing}} to go deeper. [...] "Fred has sense and knowledge enough to make him respectable, if he likes, in some good worldly business, but I can never imagine him preaching and exhorting, and pronouncing blessings, and praying by the sick, without feeling as if I were looking at a caricature. His being a clergyman would be only for gentility's sake, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> nothing more contemptible than such imbecile gentility. I used to think that of Mr. Crowse, with his empty face and neat umbrella, and mincing little speeches. What right have such men to represent Christianity--as if it were an institution for getting up idiots genteelly--as if--" [...] Mary checked herself. She had been carried along {{as if she had been}} speaking to Fred instead of Mr. Farebrother.|$|E
5000|$|... "Bill Day {{is one of}} {{the great}} cartoonists, and is one of my friends and constituents. He’s been doing a series on gun {{violence}} and how it’s affected America," [...] Cohen said on MSNBC. [...] "I wanted to get Bill Day’s cartoon out there in the marketplace of ideas, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> definitely is a connection between the NRA and the continuing gun culture that we have." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, you {{see there}} it is, Captain Gills,' said Mr Toots, with a {{perceptible}} increase in the nervousness of his manner. 'It's {{not for me to}} say what may have taken place, or what may not have taken place. Indeed, I don't know. I get mixed up with all sorts of things that I don't quite understand, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there's</b> something rather weak in my--in my head, in short.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's puzzling," [...] Blake {{answered}} thoughtfully. [...] "He {{hinted that}} {{he was interested in}} their superstitions, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> was some truth in it. Meddling with these things seems to have a fascination for neurotic people, and as the fellow's a sensualist he may find some form of indulgence that wouldn't be tolerated near the settlements. All this, however, doesn't quite seem to account for the thing." ...|$|R
