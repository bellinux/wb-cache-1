40|$|Background: Many people {{participating}} in dementia research may lack capacity to give informed consent {{and the relationship}} between cognitive function and capacity remains unclear. Recent changes in the law reinforce the need for robust and reproducible methods of assessing capacity when recruiting people for research. Aims: To identify numbers of capacitous participants in a pragmatic randomised trial of dementia treatment; to assess characteristics associated with capacity; to describe a legally <b>acceptable</b> <b>consent</b> process for research. Methods: As part of a pragmatic randomised controlled trial of Ginkgo biloba for mild-moderate dementia, we used a consenting algorithm that met the requirements of existing case law and the exigencies of the new Mental Capacity Act. We decided who had capacity to give informed consent for participation in the trial using this algorithm and sought predictors of capacity. Results: Most participants (76 %) with mild-moderate dementia in this trial were unable to give informed consent according to the legal criteria. When adjusted for confounding, the Mini Mental State examination did not predict the presence of capacity. Conclusion: Cognitive testing alone is insufficient to assess the presence of capacity. Researchers and clinicians {{need to be aware of}} the challenging processes regarding capacity assessment. We outline a procedure which we believe meets the ethical and legal require-ments. The Mental Capacity Act for England and Wales includes a legal framework for individuals lacking capacity who participate in research. 1 The Act came into force in April 2007 as regard...|$|E

The Norwich Adherence Glaucoma Study (NAGS) adopted gold-standard methods including randomisation and objective outcome measurement to investigate an adherence intervention. Patients were randomised to standard care alone (control group) or additional glaucoma and medication related information provision using Behaviour Change Counselling. A Travalert Dosing Aid® (TDA) {{was used to}} collect 8 months of adherence data. For the 208 patients randomised, adherence was higher than expected {{in the control group}} and {{there was no significant difference}} in adherence between intervention and control. Two qualitative studies collected user experiences from NAGS and established patient experiences of administering eye drops using the TDA. Potential NAGS experimental design errors were identified that might have inadvertently introduced changes in patient behaviour, causing bias in the observed study outcomes; a phenomenon known as a reactivity effect. Thus, the React study was designed to quantify the magnitude of reactivity effects on observed adherence behaviour, but the study required the use of a modified consent method. Focus groups informed the content of a questionnaire that was piloted using cognitive interviewing methods. The subsequent questionnaire was distributed to 400 members of the public attending an out-patient NHS hospital. From the 208 questionnaires returned, the majority of respondents felt that the proposed React study used an <b>acceptable</b> <b>consent</b> method in order to investigate reactivity effects. Work continues with the React study to recruit the target sample size. Participants with lower measured adherence were less likely to participate and this self-selecting bias compromised estimates of the true magnitude of reactivity effects. However, the evidence collected to date confirmed the presence of reactivity effects. This research suggests that objective measures coupled with modified consent procedures may be an appropriate methodological strategy to minimise reactivity effects in trials designed to change behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Background/aims: In {{the context}} of {{research}} on medical practices, which includes comparative effectiveness research and pragmatic clinical trials, empirical studies have begun to {{raise questions about the}} extent to which institutional review boards’ interpretations and applications of research regulations align with patients’ values. To better understand the similarities and differences between these stakeholder groups, we compare and contrast two surveys: one of institutional review board professionals and one of patients, which examine views on consent for research on medical practices. Methods: We conducted online surveys of two target populations between July 2014 and March 2015. We surveyed 601 human subjects research professionals out of 1500 randomly selected from the Public Responsibility in Medicine and Research membership list (40. 1 % response rate), limiting analysis to 537 respondents who reported having had institutional review board experience. We also surveyed 120 adult patients out of 225 approached at subspecialty clinics in Spokane, Washington (53. 3 % response rate). Our survey questions probed attitudes about consent in {{the context of}} research on medical practices using medical record review and randomization. The patient survey included three embedded animated videos to explain these concepts. Results: A majority of institutional review board professionals distinguished between consent preferences for medical record review and randomization, ranked clinicians as the least preferred person to obtain participant consent (54. 6 %), and viewed written or verbal permission as the minimum <b>acceptable</b> <b>consent</b> approach for research on medical practices using randomization (87. 3 %). In contrast, most patients had similar consent preferences for research on medical practices using randomization and medical record review, most preferred to have consent conversations with their doctors rather than with researchers for studies using randomization (72. 6 %) and medical record review (67. 0 %), and only a few preferred to see research involving randomization (16. 8 %) or medical record review (13. 8 %) not take place if obtaining written or verbal permission would make the research too difficult to conduct. Limitations of our post hoc analysis include differences in framing, structure, and language between the two surveys and possible response bias. Conclusion: Our findings highlight a need to identify appropriate ways to integrate patient preferences into prevailing regulatory interpretations as institutional review boards increasingly apply research regulations in the context of research on medical practices. Dialogue between institutional review boards and research participants will be an important part of this process and should inform future regulatory guidance...|$|E

40|$|Background: Participation in {{clinical}} trials can be useful {{for the health of}} a person, in who it is conducted, but it {{does not have to be}} – it can even be harmful. Therefore, primary motive to accept such risk is humanity and human wish to contribute to the progress of medicine; this is expressed by personal consent. The consent, however, can be an expression of personal humanity, and for this, it is not logical that someone can give consent on behalf of someone else, as it is done by a legally authorized representative on behalf of a minor. Therefore, authors raise 3 questions: What are the reasons to consider representative's <b>consent</b> <b>acceptable?</b> How should a model of regulations look like in order to provide the most complete possible protection to a minor? Is actual regulation of minors' position within international and Serbian law, analyzed here by authors for their specific solutions, <b>acceptable?</b> Representative's <b>consent</b> is <b>acceptable</b> only for therapeutic research, because these can bring benefits to everyone's health, including a minor in which those are conducted – this is an acceptable (secondary) motive of participation in the research. Expression of humanity on other's behalf, typical for non-therapeutic research, is not acceptable; this makes ban of minors' participation in non-therapeutic research more appropriate regulation model. International regulations are not in accordance to results presented in the paper for allowing participation of minors both in therapeutic and non-therapeutic research. Serbian regulation is closer to the most acceptable regulation model...|$|R
40|$|LetterThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] the Editor: A recent contribution to the SAMJ has highlighted the·term informed consent. Malpractice litigation, which only a decade ago was a rather infrequent occurrence, has increased at an alarming rate. Those involved often tend to place the blame for this situation on anorneys seeking to profit from easily earned fees. To blame the problem solely on the legal profession is not being realistic. We also have {{to understand why the}} public has become more litigious. One of the major factors contributing to the inctease in litigation has been the growth of consumerism in our society. Anything less than perfection is considered the basis for a potential malpractice suit. Even worse is the fact that substandard care is no longer the only issue. Such suits are defensible only on the basis of proper informed consent. Perhaps we must try to understand what consti-. tutes <b>acceptable</b> informed <b>consent.</b> Publisher’s versio...|$|R
40|$|According to the Declaration of Helsinki, {{participation}} of human subjects in medical research is only acceptable if subjects have given their consent. But in {{child abuse and}} neglect, many studies use a design in which subjects do not actively participate. Data in these studies are gathered from sources such as medical records or Child Protective Services. As long as such data are used anonymously, this does not interfere with individual privacy rights. However, some research is only possible when carried out with personally identifiable data, which could potentially be misused. In this paper, we discuss in which situations and under which conditions personal data of children {{may be used for}} a study without obtaining consent. In doing so, we make use of two recent studies, performed in our hospital, in which we encountered this issue. Both studies involved collecting personal data. After careful consideration, we decided not to ask informed consent; instead, we arranged for specific safeguards to protect the subject's and their parents' privacy as well as possible. Altogether, we conclude that our approach fits within the Dutch legal framework and seems a reasonable solution in situations in which individual privacy rights are at odds with the public interest of child abuse and neglect research. We argue that, although, in principle, data research is only <b>acceptable</b> after informed <b>consent</b> is obtained, the law should allow that, under specific circumstances and safeguards, this requirement is put aside to make research in the field of child abuse and neglect possible. • In principle, data research is only <b>acceptable</b> after informed <b>consent</b> is obtained. • In practice, this is not always feasible. • Under specific circumstances and safeguards, the informed consent requirement can be put asid...|$|R

Internationally, nurse-managed clinics {{are used in}} coordinating and managing chronic illness and are more effective then traditional care. They have also been used in Australia in heart failure and diabetes management. However the role of PNs in Australian general practice is not established. One issue is its acceptability to the consumer, about which there is limited information. We are designing a research project investigating a PN-led collaborative care model of chronic disease management within general practice, and {{as a first step}} wanted to estimate patient acceptability to the model. The objective was to trial our patient recruitment procedure and the outcome was an indication of whether the design would recruit sufficient numbers of patients. Our research questions focussed on whether or not the participant recruitment methods: - were easy to follow for PNs and practice staff - were considered feasible to fit in with the regular practice routine and workload, and - provided us with an <b>acceptable</b> percentage of <b>consenting</b> patients...|$|R
40|$|Recruitment to trials {{is known}} to be difficult. Previous {{research}} suggests that a crucial factor may be participants' difficulty with the concept of randomization. This study explored patients' perceptions of randomization and reasons for consent or refusal to participate in the ProtecT study (a randomized trial of surgery, radiotherapy, and monitoring for localized prostate cancer). In-depth interviews were conducted with 21 men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer who were {{invited to participate in the}} ProtecT treatment trial. Interviewees were selected purposefully from three U. K. clinical centers to ensure the inclusion of similar proportions of those agreeing or refusing random treatment allocation in each of the treatment groups. Interviews explored men's recall and understanding of chance, comparison, and equipoise, and reasons for consent/refusal of randomization and acceptance/rejection of treatment allocation. Data were analyzed methodically using the techniques of constant comparison. Checking of coding and interpretation was assured by four experienced qualitative researchers. Recall and understanding of the major principles of the randomized design were good and were similar for "chance" and "comparison" between those who consented to and refused randomization. Clinical equipoise, however, caused difficulty. Almost all recalled and understood it, but those who found it <b>acceptable</b> tended to <b>consent</b> to randomization and those who could not accept it tended to refuse to participate. Belief in clinical equipoise was key to participants' consent to randomization. Ensuring patients understand and accept equipoise may thus increase their readiness to consent to participate in trials. A priority for future research is to focus on the provision and presentation of suitable and effective trial information, concentrating in particular on the neglected concept of clinical equipoise...|$|R
40|$|No {{religion}} formally forbids donation or {{receipt of}} organs or is against transplantation from living or deceased donors. Only some orthodox jews may have religious objections to “opting in. ” However, transplantation from deceased donors may be discouraged by Native Americans, Roma Gypsies, Confucians, Shintoists, and some Orthodox rabbis. Some South Asia Muslim ulemas (scholars) and muftis (jurists) oppose donation from human living and deceased donors because {{the human body}} is an “amanat” (trusteeship) from God and must not be desecrated following death, but they encourage xenotransplantation research. No religion formally obliges one to donate or refuse organs. No religion formally obliges one to consider cadaveric organs “a societal resource” or considers organ donation “a religious duty” (except some rabbis and isolated Muslim and Christian scholars) No religion has a formal position on “bonus points,” which is priority on the waiting list. Living organ donation is strongly encouraged only between jesus christians (15 of 28 jesus christians worldwide have donated a kidney). No religion forbids this practice. Directed organ donation to people of the same religion has been proposed only by some Orthodox Jews and some Islamic Ulemas/Muftis. Only some Muslim Ulemas/Muftis and some Asian religions may prefer living donation over cadaveric donation. No religion prefers cadaveric over living donation. No religion formally forbids non–heart-beating donors (nhbd) cadaveric donation or cross-over donation. Due to the sacrad of human life, the Catholic Church is against donation from anencephalic donors or after active euthanasia. No religion formally forbids xenotransplantation. Addressing the participants of the First International Congress of the Society for Organ Sharing in 1991, Pope John Paul II said “There are many questions of an ethical, legal and social nature which need to be more deeply investigated. There are even shameful abuses which call for determined action on the part of medical association and donor societies, and especially of competent legislative bodies” and later on “In effect, {{the human body is}} always a personal body, the body of a person. The body cannot be treated as a merely physical or biological entity, nor can its organs and tissues ever be used as item for sale or exchange”. Addressing the participants at the XVIII International Congress of the Transplantation Society in 2000, Pope John Paul II said “Accordingly, any procedure which tends to commercialize human organs or to consider them as items of exchange or trade must be considered morally unacceptable, because to use the body as an object is to violate the dignity of the human person” and later on added “The criteria for assigning donated organs should in no way be discriminatory (i. e. based on age, sex, race, religion, social standing, etc.) or utilitarian (i. e. based on work capacity, social usefulness, etc.). ” To conclude, according to the Catechism of the Catholic Church Compendium signed by Pope Benedict XVI on june 28, 2005, 476 : “Are allowed transplantation and organ donation, before and after death? Organ trans- plantation is morally <b>acceptable</b> with the <b>consent</b> of the donor and without excessive risks for him/her. For the noble act of organ donation after death, the real death of the donor must be fully ascertained”...|$|R
