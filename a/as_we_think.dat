When Whedon received Penn's draft, he told Feige he felt the studio did not [...] "have anything" [...] and they should [...] "pretend this draft never happened". Whedon went on to write a five page treatment of his plan for the film, and created the tagline [...] "Avengers: Some Assembly Required", riffing on the [...] "Avengers Assemble" [...] slogan from the comic books. Marvel quickly began working to sign Whedon to write and direct, only stipulating that he include the Avengers against Loki, a battle among the heroes in the middle, a battle against the villains at the end, and he get the movie done for its May 2012 release. On the hiring, Arad stated: [...] "My personal opinion is that Joss will do a fantastic job. He loves these characters and is a fantastic writer... It's {{part of his life}} so you know he is going to protect it... I expect someone like him is going to make the script even better". Feige added, [...] "I've known Joss for many years. We were looking for the right thing and he came in and met on it... we want to find a director that’s on the verge of doing something great, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> Joss is."

2500|$|His {{progressive}} {{interpretation of}} American history was highly {{influential in the}} 1920s and 1930s and helped define modern liberalism in the United States. [...] After receiving overwhelming praise and exerting enormous influence among intellectuals in the 1930s and 1940s, Parrington's ideas fell out of fashion before 1950. Richard Hofstadter says [...] "the most striking thing about the reputation of V L Parrington, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> of it today, is its abrupt decline....during the 1940s Parrington rather quickly cease to have a compelling interest for students of American literature, and in time historians too began to desert him." [...] Hofstadter shows how Parrington's ideas came under heavy assault in the 1940s and 1950s, naming Lionel Trilling as especially influential in the attack. [...] Yale's Harold Bloom says: [...] "Parrington was, in turn, condemned to obscurity by critics like Lionel Trilling, who sharply criticized his literary nationalism and his insistence that literature should appeal to a popular constituency." [...] Liberal historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., in his autobiography, says that the progressive histories of the 1920s such as Main Currents, [...] "are little read and their authors largely forgotten." [...] He adds that, [...] "Main Currents impoverished the rich and complex American past. Parrington reduced Jonathan Edwards, Poe, Hawthorne, Melville, Henry James to marginal figures, practitioners of belles lettres, not illuminators of the American experience." ...|$|E
