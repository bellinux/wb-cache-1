The game tightened up once again and the scores were slower in coming. With about thirteen minutes left {{to play in the}} game the ball broke to Jimmy Barry-Murphy just {{to the left of the}} Kilkenny goalpost. He sent in a low shot that bobbled along the ground and somehow found its way into the Kilkenny net. The significance of this goal was summed up by RTÉ commentator Michael O'Hehir who declared ‘…and Jimmy Barry-Murphy, the scorer of the goal that could win an All-Ireland.’ This gave Cork a five-point lead; however, this was eaten into immediately when Billy Fitzpatrick responded with a goal of his own. With Cork leading by 1-13 to 2-8 the destination of the Liam McCarthy Cup still hung in the balance. Charlie McCarthy failed to extend Cork’s lead after the puck-out as his effort went wide. With time running out Kilkenny were awarded a line ball in the corner of the Hogan <b>and</b> <b>Nally</b> Stands. Ray Cummins, who was having an off day by his standards, blocked the sliothar and nonchalantly sent it over the bar to restore Cork’s three-point lead. The dying minutes of the game saw both sides shoot over wides, two for Cork and one for Kilkenny. The final score of the day, and indeed the final score of the championship, went to Cork’s captain Charlie McCarthy who slotted over a neat point. The referee blew the full-time whistle immediately after the puck-out and Cork had won the game by 1-15 to 2-8.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Modify the {{scatterer}} conguration of a planar, nite-horizon Lorentz {{process in}} a bounded domain. Sinai asked in 1981 whether for the diffusively scaled variant of the modied process convergence to Brownian motion still holds. The main re-sult of the work answers Sinai's question in the afrmative. Other types of local perturbations are also investigated: nite horizon periodic Lorentz process in the half-strip or in the half-plane (in these models the local perturbation is the boundary condition) <b>and</b> <b>nally</b> nite horizon, periodic Lorentz process with a small, compactly supported external eld in the strip. The correspond-ing limiting processes are Brownian motions with suitable bound-ary conditions <b>and</b> <b>nally</b> the skew Brownian motion on the line.

50|$|It {{was after}} the 1983 All-Ireland Football Final between Dublin GAA and Galway GAA, where {{overcrowding}} on Hill 16 caused a few supporters to suffer injuries, that the GAA decided to rebuild the Hill. This work was completed in 1988, allowing a capacity of 10,000 spectators. In the mid-1990s the GAA {{came up with a}} masterplan to rebuild the whole stadium. It was envisaged that Hill 16 would be replaced with an all-seated stand, however, this met with opposition from Dublin supporters. There were also the problems of the nearby railway line {{and the fact that the}} GAA doesn't own any of the land behind Croke Park. The plans were redrawn and a new, terraced area was built at a cost of €25 million to replace the old Nally Stand, named after Pat <b>Nally,</b> <b>and</b> Hill 16. The new Railway End, which includes Hill 16 <b>and</b> the <b>Nally</b> terrace, is capable of holding more than 13,000 spectators.|$|R

40|$|The {{floodplain}} forests, woodlands {{and wetlands}} of the Murray River {{and its tributaries}} contain important and unique species of flora and fauna and extend the geographic range {{of a number of}} species, particularly birds, into the semi-arid regions of the Riverina and Mallee (e. g. Tzaros 2001). Pulsed flooding is the major factor influ-encing biota in these river-floodplain systems (Ballinger <b>and</b> Mac <b>Nally</b> 2006). These over-bank floods also maintain ecological connec-tivity {{along the length of the}} floodplains, across the floodplains and between the rivers and the floodplains, thereby playing a crucial role in the landscape ecology of the region (Ballinger <b>and</b> Mac <b>Nally</b> 2006). However, there has been no comprehensive inventory of important natural values or flood-ing requirements to maintain these values along the Murray River floodplains. This is true for both the vegetation types and the species that rely on them. This information is vital if informed management of environmental flows is to be undertaken. In this paper we present for the first time initial estimates of the flood requirements for a comprehensive suite of Ecological Vegeta-tion Classes and rare and threatened flora and fauna species within the Murray Valley. The natural values and their flooding requirements were identified as part of final recommenda-tions of the Victorian Environmental Assess-ment Council’s (VEAC’s) investigation of Rive...|$|R
