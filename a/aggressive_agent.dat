40|$|In {{the present}} paper is {{analysed}} concrete behavior from strength structure elements, subjected to combined sulphatic and magnesian aggressive actions. In order to clearly relieve cement influence regarding corrosion behavior and to be {{as close as possible}} of concrete structural characteristics, tests are realized on standard mortars, which from compositional point of view are mocro-concretes. These were used different W/C ratios in order to obtain different structural characteristics, knowing that in the first period after casting, when concrete porosity is sensibly higher, corrosion process is more emphatic, with subsequent negative effects. It was taken into account the fact that sulphatic corrosion effect appears after a long duration of <b>aggressive</b> <b>agent</b> action, in {{the present paper}} proposing a three year duration for aggressive attack. In the same time it was considered the fact that usual cement for structural elements is composite cement type CEM II/A-S 32, 5, studying combined sulphatic and magnesian corrosion evolution on a large type of micro-concrete compositions with different compactness and <b>aggressive</b> <b>agent</b> concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: {{purpose of}} the paper is to {{presents}} results of corrosion wear of bonded and sintered hard magneticmaterials Nd-Fe-B and magnets covered by protective polymer, lacquer and metal coatings. Design/methodology/approach: Corrosion tests were made in two corrosive environments in water and in 5 %NaCl solution. Findings: It {{was found that the}} bonded magnets with the polymer matrix demonstrate better corrosion resistancethan the sintered magnets. Employment of the protective coatings on the Nd-Fe-B bonded magnets surfaces mayfeature the effective protection of the substrate material from the corrosive action of the <b>aggressive</b> <b>agent.</b> Practical implications: Magnets covered by protective polymer, lacquer or metal coating are less susceptible tocorrosion so employment of these coatings can lower the losses caused by the corrosion of magnets. Corrosionprotection of Nd-Fe-B magnets needs further investigations. Originality/value: Analysis of the surface topography of the deposited protective coatings makes it possible todetermine coating defects resulting from the action of the <b>aggressive</b> <b>agent.</b> The obtained results can be use inpractice to decrease the corrosion wear of these materials...|$|E

40|$|EN] The {{behaviour}} of lime mortars containing sepiolite or sepiolite plus pentaclorophenol in atmospheric simulation chambers {{has been}} studied. The pollutant gases {{used in this}} study have been NO, NO 2, and SO 2. The studies has been done in wet and dry conditions as well as with and without ozone. In the case of NO and NO 2, the <b>aggressive</b> <b>agent</b> would be HNO 3, which reacts with lime mortar binder CaCO 3, producing Ca(NO 3) 2 formation. On this process, the influence of the presence of an oxidant as well as water has been studied. The catalyst effect of the oxidation is known to be accelerated by water presence, so mortars exposed to NO + O 3 + H 2 O and NO 2 + O 3 + H 2 O environments undergo a greater salts formation than those exposed {{to the rest of the}} aggressive media. The three mortars’ behaviours are similar and independent of their composition, producing small amount of salts in every case. When SO 2 is the gas used, the <b>aggressive</b> <b>agent</b> of mortar will be H 2 SO 4 that reacts with mortar binder, CaCO 3 to produce calcium sulphate in the form of gypsum. Oxidant and/or water influence has been studied, and the (SO 2 + O 3 + H 2 O) chamber was found to be the one with greater aggressivity to mortars.

40|$|Based {{on these}} facts, noradrenalin must be {{considered}} the main endogenous inductor of aggressive behavior.

Thus Noradrenalin could be the stimulating factor for aggressive behavior, although we should note that specific <b>aggressive</b> <b>agent</b> is not discovered yet. And it seems that the component carrying only this function is not produced in organism. Hence, anatomical, behavioral and pharmacological studies showed, that CNS structures such as almond-shapes structure, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex influence on the decrease of memory based on negative emotions that was more shown in less aggressive animals, than is non-aggressive. We can conclude that the difference in both aggressive animals is very little than in non aggressive. That suggests the high quality of memory and consolidation of aggressive animal...|$|E
40|$|Ultrastructural {{examination}} by {{electron microscopy}} has been undertaken on human oxyntic mucosa from biopsy specimens obtained during diagnostic endoscopy from patients in whom infection by Helicobacter pylori was subsequently confirmed.

The resulting electron micrographs show densely osmiophilic inclusions of varying sizes in Helicobacter, {{some of which}} can be resolved and identified as lamellar bodies and their partially digested states. This finding indicates that Helicobacter may act as an <b>aggressive</b> <b>agent</b> by ingesting a gastric mucosal barrier of gastric surfactant, exposing the surface to attack by acid while simultaneously rendering it less hydrophobic. There is also evidence that Helicobacter pylori avoid their own digestion by coating themselves with essentially the same barrier of gastric surfactant, probably derived from the host.

40|$|Synopsis: The {{holistic}} {{model of}} the damage process of reinforced concrete structures is preliminary shown in the present paper by examining the coexistence of the main factors affecting the concrete durability: a) interconnected porosity, b) exposure to aggressive agents, and c) presence of water. In particular, this model is adopted to examine the durability of reinforced concrete structures exposed to a marine environment. At least three aggressive agents in sea water can cause deterioration of the reinforced concrete structures: chloride, sulfate and alkali ions. The specific aggressive action of each <b>aggressive</b> <b>agent</b> is examined: corrosion of the metallic bars caused by chloride ions, damage of the cement paste carried out by sulfate attack, and swelling disruption of concrete if alkali-reactive aggregates {{are present in the}} concrete. In order to prevent the damage of concrete structures exposed to a marine environment the following measures should be adopted: to reduce the water-cement ratio by using superplasticizers; to employ cementitious binders based on the combination of portland cement with mineral addition such as fly ash and/or blast furnace slag...|$|E

40|$|The {{main cause}} for RCS {{degradation}} is the corrosion of steel reinforcement, {{due to a}} pH reduction because of the carbonation process or the penetration of chloride ions leading to the pitting corrosion of steel. Concrete deterioration of reinforced concrete structures (RCS) {{has become one of}} the more costly problems, an estimated three to four percent of gross national product for direct and indirect costs in the developed countries, in maintenance and repair operations. The aim of this research work is the use of controlled delivery release corrosion inhibitors as a palliative method to prevent corrosion of RCS. This kind of inhibitors allow a controlled delivery within the concrete matrix or by incorporation in a steel conversion layer, thus enabling a slow and gradual release of the inhibitor compound as a function of the pH environment and selectivity depending on the <b>aggressive</b> <b>agent,</b> such as chloride or carbonates involved in the corrosion process.

Seven timber species namely Teak (Tectona grandis), Sal (Shorea robusta), Sil Korai (Albizia procera), Rain Tree (Samanea saman), Jam (Syzygium spp.), Jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophylus), and Mango (Mangifera indica) were tested for density, specific gravity, compressive, tensile and bending strength following ASTM standards. Four different kinds of chemical environments consisting of normal water, sodium chloride (5 %), sodium sulphate (10 %) and hydrochloric acid (5 %) were made and tested for durability {{in terms of strength}} loss over a period of 90 days.

30|$|New ventures are at {{the core}} of entrepreneurship. Why are {{engineering}} and entrepreneurship such productive partners? Henry Ford succeeded well because he understood the nature of innovation and entrepreneurship. Neither innovation nor entrepreneurship is about “a faster horse,” Ford’s conclusion about what his customers might want if left to their own imaginations. Instead, when linked hand in hand, we have to understand them as forms of engineering and commerce that naturally combine and generate a market response. In exceptional cases, it may even advance civilization. The telephone, the electric lightbulb, the internal combustion-driven vehicles, and the smart-phone are all engineering items that have had transformational impact. So when Kuratko stated that “Entrepreneurship is the most powerful economic force known to humankind” (2009, p. xviii), it may have seemed an inflated and unrealistic claim. Yet, when you examine entrepreneurship through the last three centuries, epitomized by Henry Ford’s comment, it seems that Kuratko made an important observation: Entrepreneurship is powerful because it is an <b>aggressive</b> <b>agent</b> of change and therefore an important means of advancement in society. But, entrepreneurship without science and technology is rare and found mainly in service improvements. Even Jeff Bezos’ innovative delivery service using drones depends on enhanced drone technology before his service in itself can be enhanced for customers. Disruptive innovation, therefore, can have a proliferating effect.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The authors {{present a}} review of their {{research}} work on the application of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to characterise thin (~ 3 nm) natural oxide films that spontaneously form {{on the surface of}} magnesium and its alloys in contact with the oxygen in air, and thick (> 1 μm) corrosion films rich in carbonates and other species that form during exposure to a humid atmosphere. The results obtained can provide much useful information about the protection mechanisms of these materials. Emphasis is placed on the relationship between the alloy's Al content and the characteristics of the natural oxide film and the relationship between segregation of calcium impurities from the bulk to the outer surface of the metal and repercussions on electrochemical behaviour. The natural oxide film may alone be sufficiently protective in less aggressive environments, making it of interest to know its characteristics. A detailed study will also be made of the changes in chemical composition that may occur in this passivating film with increasing exposure time to a humid atmosphere, deteriorating or reinforcing its anticorrosive properties. In particular, an attempt will be made to research the effect on corrosion behaviour of: (a) the time the different specimens are exposed to the <b>aggressive</b> <b>agent</b> (humid atmosphere); (b) the possible formation during corrosive attack of layers that are rich in carbonates and other species; and (c) the presence of aluminium (alloying element) on the protective properties of the corrosion layers...|$|E
40|$|Crack {{is called}} the {{intrinsic}} flaw of concrete that is inevitable for concrete infrastructures during their service life. The presence of crack offer <b>aggressive</b> <b>agent</b> access to pass through, which has {{a direct impact on}} durability, therefore resulting in shortened service life. Nevertheless, the influence of crack on the durability can be greatly minimized when crack width is controlled within certain limits. Engineered Cementitious Composite (ECC) is a new class of HPFRCC micro-mechanically designed to achieve high tensile strain capacity of 3 - 5 %, while maintaining very tight crack width. In this paper, we attempt to investigate the self-healing capacity of micro-cracked ECC by capillary water sorption test. Three ECC mix proportions with different volume of fly ash are used in this research. Before water curing the specimens are pre-loaded at 28 days so as to produce micro-cracks. The micro-cracked specimens are then cured under water for another 30 and 60 days, respectively, before water sorption test is conducted. It is found that water absorbed by cracks of the pre-loaded specimens reduces with increasing curing age, which suggests that self-healing products accumulate within the cracks over time. Subsequent ESEM observations also confirm the above findings. Most pronounced self-healing behavior is revealed for the mixture with highest fly ash content, which also shows smallest crack width. The crack width reduces with increasing volume of fly ash, denoting better capacity of crack width control. With excellent crack width control and self-healing behavior, ECC can be an ideal material for durable concrete infrastructure...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{corrosion}} process of steel in fly ash containing concrete, induced by the chloride ion and carbon dioxide. Reinforced concrete samples having different fly ash contents in partial substitution of portland cement were tested in: full and partial immersion in 3 % NaCl; CO_ 2 enriched atmosphere. The corrosion process was followed in the time by monitoring the open circuit potential and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Results of open circuit potential have shown three different potential ranges, which define a distinct behaviour for the reinforcing steel. In chloride environments, a study based {{on the evolution of}} the Bode spectra resulted in a criteria, which can be used to follow the evolution of the steel surface. Concerning the fly ash role, this additive has an opposite effect, depending on the <b>aggressive</b> <b>agent.</b> In chloride containing environment it has a protective effect, but under CO_ 2 induced corrosion fly ash results in higher corrosion rates. Two analytical surface techniques - Auger and X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy - were used to characterize films formed in solutions simulating the concrete solution.

40|$|One of the {{principal}} causes of deterioration in reinforced concrete structures is steel corrosion caused by the penetration of <b>aggressive</b> <b>agents</b> into the protective cover concrete layer (particularly water containing chlorides). Electromagnetic non- destructive evaluation (EM NDE) techniques are sensitive to these <b>aggressive</b> <b>agents</b> {{and can be used}} to assess concrete durability in terms of corrosion risk. The electromagnetic (EM) properties that are the focus of the study presented here are electrical resistivity and dielectric permittivity-inherent material properties that are both sensitive to degree of saturation and the salinity of the pore solution. Three EM NDE techniques suitable for the in situ investigation of concrete are used to obtain these EM properties: electrical resistivity tomography, capacimetry and ground penetrating radar. Experimental work is conducted on in a controlled laboratory environment with the aim of comparing the ability of the three EM NDE techniques to monitor the ingress of saline solutions into concrete slabs and discern between their chloride content. All three methods are found to be capable of detecting variation in water and chloride content and therefore show promise for the in situ monitoring of water and chloride ingress.
