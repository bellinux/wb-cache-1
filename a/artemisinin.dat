5|$|<b>Artemisinin</b> is a {{sesquiterpene}} lactone {{containing a}} peroxide group, which {{is believed to}} be essential for its anti-malarial activity. Its derivatives, artesunate and artemether, have been used in clinics since 1987 for the treatment of drug-resistant and drug-sensitive malaria, especially cerebral malaria. These drugs are characterized by fast action, high efficacy and good tolerance. They kill the asexual forms of P. berghei and P. cynomolgi and have transmission-blocking activity. In 1985, Zhou Yiqing and his team combined artemether and lumefantrine into a single tablet, which was registered as a medicine in China in 1992. Later it became known as “Coartem”. <b>Artemisinin</b> combination treatments (ACTs) are now widely used to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria, but access to ACTs is still limited in most malaria-endemic countries and only a minority of the patients who need artemisinin-based combination treatments receive them.|$|E
5|$|Drug {{resistance}} poses {{a growing}} problem in 21st-century malaria treatment. Resistance is now common against all classes of antimalarial drugs apart from artemisinins. Treatment of resistant strains became increasingly dependent on this class of drugs. The cost of artemisinins limits their use in the developing world. Malaria strains found on the Cambodia–Thailand border are resistant to combination therapies that include artemisinins, and may, therefore, be untreatable. Exposure of the parasite population to <b>artemisinin</b> monotherapies in subtherapeutic doses for over 30 years {{and the availability of}} substandard artemisinins likely drove the selection of the resistant phenotype. Resistance to <b>artemisinin</b> has been detected in Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam, and there has been emerging resistance in Laos.|$|E
40|$|<b>Artemisinins</b> {{form the}} most {{important}} class of antimalarial currently available, particularly because they are effective against parasites resistant to almost all the other classes. Their mechanism of action is controversial. Some aspects of this controversy are reviewed here. Whilst there is no clinical resistance yet identified to <b>artemisinins,</b> the potential {{to examine the relationship}} between polymorphisms in PfATP 6 (a target of <b>artemisinins)</b> in multidrug resistant isolates of Plasmodium falciparum, is also discussed.

40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of praziquantel and the <b>artemisinins</b> on adult Echinostoma caproni. In vitro, both praziquantel and the <b>artemisinins</b> exhibited exposure-response relationships. In vivo, worm burden reductions of 100 % were achieved with single oral doses of praziquantel, artesunate, and artemether at 50, 700, and 1, 100 mg/kg of body weight, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Multidrug-resistant malaria {{caused by}} Plasmodium falciparum has {{severely}} limited treatment options over recent years. <b>Artemisinins</b> are still effective for treating uncomplicated {{as well as}} severe malaria, because resistance is not yet clinically apparent. This article reviews some clinically useful properties of <b>artemisinins</b> and how they might work. (C) 2004 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved...|$|R
5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, traditional herbal remedies {{have been used}} to treat malaria. The first effective treatment for malaria came from the bark of cinchona tree, which contains quinine. After the link to mosquitos and their parasites were identified in the early twentieth century, mosquito control measures such as widespread use of the insecticide DDT, swamp drainage, covering or oiling the surface of open water sources, indoor residual spraying and use of insecticide treated nets was initiated. Prophylactic quinine was prescribed in malaria endemic areas, and new therapeutic drugs, including chloroquine and artemisinins, were used to resist the scourge. Today, <b>artemisinin</b> is present in every remedy applied in treatment of malaria. After introducing <b>artemisinin</b> as a cure administered together with other remedies, the mortality in Africa went down by a half.|$|E
5|$|Systematic {{screening}} of traditional Chinese medical herbs {{was carried out}} by Chinese research teams, consisting of hundreds of scientists in the 1960s and 1970s. Qinghaosu, later named <b>artemisinin,</b> was cold-extracted in a neutral milieu (pH 7.0) from the dried leaves of Artemisia annua.|$|E
5|$|The risk {{of disease}} {{can be reduced}} by {{preventing}} mosquito bites {{through the use of}} mosquito nets and insect repellents, or with mosquito control measures such as spraying insecticides and draining standing water. Several medications are available to prevent malaria in travellers to areas where the disease is common. Occasional doses of the combination medication sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine are recommended in infants and after the first trimester of pregnancy in areas with high rates of malaria. Despite a need, no effective vaccine exists, although efforts to develop one are ongoing. The recommended treatment for malaria is a combination of antimalarial medications that includes an <b>artemisinin.</b> The second medication may be either mefloquine, lumefantrine, or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. Quinine along with doxycycline may be used if an <b>artemisinin</b> is not available. It is recommended that in areas where the disease is common, malaria is confirmed if possible before treatment is started due to concerns of increasing drug resistance. Resistance among the parasites has developed to several antimalarial medications; for example, chloroquine-resistant P.falciparum has spread to most malarial areas, and resistance to <b>artemisinin</b> has become a problem in some parts of Southeast Asia.|$|E
40|$|<b>Artemisinins</b> are {{the most}} {{important}} anti-malarial drugs in use today, but are more costly than previous anti-malarials and production and price tend to fluctuate. Alternative ways of producing <b>artemisinins</b> are discussed here in the light of a recent paper in BMC Biotechnology on improving the yield of the precursor, artemisinic acid, in genetically engineered yeast...|$|R
40|$|<b>Artemisinins</b> are {{proposed}} {{to act in}} the malaria parasite cytosol by oxidizing dihydroflavin cofactors of redox-active flavoenzymes, and under aerobic conditions by inducing their autoxidation. Perturbation of redox homeostasis coupled with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) ensues. Ascorbic acid-methylene blue (MB), N-benzyl- 1, 4 -dihydronicotinamide (BNAH) -MB, BNAH-lumiflavine, BNAH-riboflavin (RF), and NADPH-FAD-E. coli flavin reductase (Fre) systems at pH 7. 4 generate leucomethylene blue (LMB) and reduced flavins that are rapidly oxidized in situ by <b>artemisinins.</b> These oxidations are inhibited by the 4 -aminoquinolines piperaquine (PPQ), chloroquine (CQ), and others. In contrast, the arylmethanols lumefantrine, mefloquine (MFQ), and quinine (QN) have little or no effect. Inhibition correlates with the antagonism exerted by 4 -aminoquinolines on the antimalarial activities of MB, RF, and <b>artemisinins.</b> Lack of inhibition correlates with the additivity/synergism between the arylmethanols and <b>artemisinins.</b> We propose association via pi complex formation between the 4 -aminoquinolines and LMB or the dihydroflavins; this hinders hydride transfer from the reduced conjugates to the <b>artemisinins.</b> The arylmethanols have a decreased tendency to form pi complexes, and so exert no effect. The parallel between chemical reactivity and antagonism or additivity/synergism draws attention to the mechanism of action of all drugs described herein. CQ and QN inhibit the formation of hemozoin in the parasite digestive vacuole (DV). The buildup of heme-Fe-III results in an enhanced efflux from the DV into the cytosol. In addition, the lipophilic heme-Fe-III complexes of CQ and QN that form in the DV {{are proposed}} to diffuse across the DV membrane. At the higher pH of the cytosol, the complexes decompose to liberate heme-Fe-III. The quinoline or arylmethanol reenters the DV, and so transfers more heme-Fe-III out of the DV. In this way, the 4 -aminoquinolines and arylmethanols exert antimalarial activities by enhancing heme-Fe-III and thence free Fe-III concentrations in the cytosol. The iron species enter into redox cycles through reduction of Fe-III to Fe-II largely mediated by reduced flavin cofactors and likely also by NAD(P) H-Fre. Generation of ROS through oxidation of Fe-II by oxygen will also result. The cytotoxicities of <b>artemisinins</b> are thereby reinforced by the iron. Other aspects of drug action are emphasized. In the cytosol or DV, association by pi complex formation between pairs of lipophilic drugs must adversely influence the pharmacokinetics of each drug. This explains the antagonism between PPQ and MFQ, for example. The basis for the antimalarial activity of RF mirrors that of MB, wherein it participates in redox cycling that involves flavoenzymes or Fre, resulting in attrition of NAD(P) H. The generation of ROS by <b>artemisinins</b> and ensuing Fenton chemistry accommodate the ability of <b>artemisinins</b> to induce membrane damage and to affect the parasite SERCA PfATP 6 Ca 2 + transporter. Thus, the effect exerted by <b>artemisinins</b> is more likely a downstream event involving ROS that will also be modulated by mutations in PfATP 6. Such mutations attenuate, but cannot abrogate, antimalarial activities of <b>artemisinins.</b> Overall, parasite resistance to <b>artemisinins</b> arises through enhancement of antioxidant defense mechanisms...|$|R
25|$|<b>Artemisinins</b> {{can be used}} alone, {{but this}} leads to a high rate of {{recrudescence}} (return of parasites) and other drugs are required to clear the body of all parasites and prevent recurrence. The World Health Organization (WHO) is pressuring manufacturers to stop making the uncompounded drug available to the medical community at large, aware of the catastrophe that would result if the malaria parasite developed resistance to <b>artemisinins.</b>|$|R
5|$|Recommended {{treatment}} for severe malaria is the intravenous use of antimalarial drugs. For severe malaria, parenteral artesunate {{was superior to}} quinine in both children and adults. In another systematic review, <b>artemisinin</b> derivatives (artemether and arteether) were as efficacious as quinine {{in the treatment of}} cerebral malaria in children. Treatment of severe malaria involves supportive measures that are best done in a critical care unit. This includes the management of high fevers and the seizures that may result from it. It also includes monitoring for poor breathing effort, low blood sugar, and low blood potassium.|$|E
25|$|The WHO has {{recommended}} <b>artemisinin</b> combination therapies (ACT) be the first-line therapy for P. falciparum malaria worldwide. Combinations are effective because the <b>artemisinin</b> component kills {{the majority of}} parasites {{at the start of}} the treatment, while the more slowly eliminated partner drug clears the remaining parasites.|$|E
25|$|Transgenic yeast {{are used}} to produce <b>artemisinin,</b> {{as well as a}} number of insulin analogs.|$|E
40|$|In {{line with}} the {{enhancement}} of antimalarial activities of the current clinical <b>artemisinins</b> against parasites cultured under CO, the <b>artemisinins</b> are unaffected in vitro by carboxyhemoglobin (CO-Hb-Fe-II) or CO-heme-Fe-II, but are competitively decomposed by Hb-Fe-II or heme-Fe-II. In the latter case, the heme studies are greatly facilitated by solubilization of the heme in aqueous medium by use of arginine. None of the Hb species has an appreciable effect on artemisone, or on other aminoartemisinins, and antimalarial activities are either less affected or remain essentially unchanged against parasites cultured under standard microaerophilic conditions or under CO. The findings not only indicate that <b>artemisinins</b> do not require Hb-Fe-II or heme-Fe-II for promotion of antimalarial activity, but are also important {{in relation to the}} therapy of severe/complicated or cerebral malaria...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of praziquantel and the <b>artemisinins</b> on adult Echinostoma caproni. In vitro, both praziquantel and the <b>artemisinins</b> exhibited exposure-response relationships. In vivo, worm burden reductions of 100 % were achieved with single oral doses of praziquantel, artesunate, and artemether at 50, 700, and 1, 100 mg/kg of body weight, respectively. Food-borne trematodiasis is an emerging public health prob-lem (6). The current arsenal for treatment and morbidity con-trol of food-borne trematodiasis consists of only two drugs, namely, praziquantel and triclabendazole (4, 5), and hence new drugs are urgently needed. We studied the trematocidal prop-erties of the <b>artemisinins</b> against adult Echinostoma caproni in vitro and in vivo. For comparison, the effect of praziquantel was also examined. Approval of our animal studies was obtained according to local government regulations. Artesunate was obtained from Mepha (Aesch, Switzerland); artemether, arteether, and praziquantel wer...|$|R
50|$|Artesunate suppositories {{are used}} for the {{treatment}} of malaria. Artesunate is an antimalarial water-soluble derivative of dihydroartemisinin. <b>Artemisinins</b> are sesquiterpene lactones isolated from Artemisia annua, a Chinese traditional medicine.|$|R
25|$|Arteminisinin, anti-malarial treatment: The {{antimalarial}} drug of compound <b>artemisinin</b> found in Artemisia annua, {{the latter being}} a plant long used in traditional Chinese medicine, was discovered in 1972 by Chinese scientists in the People's Republic led by Tu Youyou and {{has been used to}} treat multi-drug resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. <b>Artemisinin</b> remains the most effective treatment for malaria today and has saved millions of lives and is yielded one of the greatest drug discoveries in modern medicine.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{evidence}} for <b>artemisinin</b> resistance in southeast Asia was first reported in 2008, and was subsequently confirmed by a detailed study from western Cambodia.|$|E
25|$|ILs can extract {{specific}} compounds {{from plants}} for pharmaceutical, nutritional and cosmetic applications, {{such as the}} antimalarial drug <b>artemisinin</b> from the plant Artemisia annua.|$|E
25|$|<b>Artemisinins</b> are {{not used}} for malaria {{prophylaxis}} (prevention) because of the extremely short activity (half-life) of the drug. To be effective, {{it would have to}} be administered multiple times each day.|$|R
40|$|<b>Artemisinins</b> {{are derived}} from {{extracts}} of sweet wormwood (Artemisia annua) and are well established {{for the treatment of}} malaria, including highly drug-resistant strains. Their efficacy also extends to phylogenetically unrelated parasitic infections such as schistosomiasis. More recently, they have also shown potent and broad anticancer properties in cell lines and animal models. In this review, we discuss recent advances in defining the role of <b>artemisinins</b> in medicine, with particular focus on their controversial mechanisms of action. This safe and cheap drug class that saves lives at risk from malaria can also have important potential in oncology...|$|R
50|$|As of 2006, it is {{no longer}} {{recommended}} by the WHO (World Health Organization) as a first-line treatment for malaria, and it should be used only when <b>artemisinins</b> are not available. Quinine is also used to treat lupus and arthritis.|$|R
25|$|A serendipitous {{discovery}} {{was made in}} China in the early 1980s while searching for novel anthelmintics for schistosomiasis that <b>artemisinin</b> was effective against schistosomes, the human blood flukes, which are the second-most prevalent parasitic infections, after malaria. <b>Artemisinin</b> and its derivatives are all potent anthelmintics. Artemisinins were later found to possess {{a broad spectrum of}} activity against a wide range of trematodes, including Schistosoma japonicum, S. mansoni, S. haematobium, Clonorchis sinensis, Fasciola hepatica, and Opisthorchis viverrini. Clinical trials were also successfully conducted in Africa among patients with schistosomiasis.|$|E
25|$|Chemically, <b>artemisinin</b> is a {{sesquiterpene}} lactone containing {{an unusual}} peroxide bridge. This peroxide {{is believed to}} be responsible for the drug's mechanism of action. Few other natural compounds with such a peroxide bridge are known.|$|E
25|$|<b>Artemisinin</b> and its endoperoxides {{derivatives}} {{have been}} used for the treatment of P. falciparum related infections but low bioavailability, poor pharmacokinetic properties and high cost of the drugs are a major drawback of their use.|$|E
40|$|Antimalarial drug therapies {{containing}} <b>artemisinins,</b> 'ACTs', {{have become}} the mainstay for treating uncomplicated malaria in endemic countries. This is a major public health achievement requiring substantial political, financial and scientific input. The most compelling scientific argument for ACT deployment employed a very simple basic rationale that emphasised their role in slowing the origin of drug resistance while largely neglecting the additional role(s) of ACTs in slowing or preventing the spread of resistance once it has arisen. Recent reports suggest that early stages of resistance to <b>artemisinins</b> and/or its partner drugs could be occurring, thus it is timely to briefly review exactly how ACTs slow the origin and spread of resistance and to interpret the threat of resistance within this context...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{gains in}} {{reducing}} the global burden of malaria are threatened {{by the emergence of}} Plasmodium falciparum resistance to <b>artemisinins.</b> The discovery that mutations in portions of a P. falciparum gene encoding kelch (K 13) -propeller domains are the major determinant of resistance has provided opportunities for monitoring such resistance on a global scale...|$|R
25|$|Although {{there are}} {{therapeutic}} medications to treat malaria, Plasmodium has accumulated increasing drug resistance over time. A recent examination {{has shown that}} even <b>artemisinin,</b> {{one of the most}} powerful anti-malarial drugs, has been experiencing decreased efficacy due to the development of resistance.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{recommendations}} of the World Health Organization, Nigeria decided to stop the prescription of chloroquine, the parasite responsible for malaria becoming resistant to this molecule used until today. Nigeria will be using <b>Artemisinin,</b> a more effective but also more expensive drug.|$|E
25|$|Transcriptomic {{profiling}} {{also provides}} crucial information on mechanisms of drug resistance. Analysis of over 1000 Plasmodium falciparum isolates identified that upregulation of the unfolded protein response and slower progression {{through the early}} stages of the asexual intraerythrocytic developmental cycle were associated with <b>artemisinin</b> resistance in isolates from Southeast Asia.|$|E
25|$|Malaria is {{widespread}} in tropical and subtropical regions, including {{parts of the}} Americas, Asia, and Africa. Each year, there are approximately 350–500 million cases of malaria.
