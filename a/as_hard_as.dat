5|$|It {{is not a}} far {{stretch to}} imagine that if Agnew had contested {{corruption}} charges half <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> Nixon denied culpability for Watergate – as Goldwater and several other stalwart conservatives wanted him to – today we might be speaking of Agnew-Democrats and Agnewnomics, and deem Agnew the father of modern conservatism.|$|E
5|$|Titanium is not <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> some {{grades of}} {{heat-treated}} steel; it is non-magnetic and a poor conductor {{of heat and}} electricity. Machining requires precautions, because the material can gall unless sharp tools and proper cooling methods are used. Like steel structures, those made from titanium have a fatigue limit that guarantees longevity in some applications.|$|E

5|$|After {{the path}} was {{finalized}} came the augers and drillers for the holes {{that served as}} foundations for the Vertical Support Members that held up the pipe. These holes were drilled and filled {{with a mix of}} water, gravel and dirt before a VSM was dropped into each hole. Because of the frozen ground, the gravel and dirt froze <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> concrete, sealing the VSMs in place. The VSMs were laid in parallel, two at a time, and each had a semicircular rest for the pipeline segments. These were carried in 40-foot or 80-foot segments by crane or sideboom to the appropriate location, lowered into place, then welded together. The welds were then inspected via X-ray by quality control engineers who followed the welders.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{tendency}} by some modern scholars to ascribe to ancient barbarians a degree of ethnic solidarity that did not exist, according to A.H.M. Jones. Germanic tribes were constantly fighting each other and even within such tribal confederations as the Franks or Alamanni there were bitter feuds between the constituent tribes and clans. Indeed, a primary reason why many tribal sub-groups surrendered to the Roman authorities (dediticii) and sought to settle in the empire as laeti was in order to escape pressure from their neighbours. The few known conflicts of loyalty only arose when the Roman army was campaigning against a barbarian-born soldier's own specific clan. Ammianus himself never characterises barbarian-born troops as unreliable. On the contrary, his evidence is that barbarian soldiers were as loyal, and fought <b>as</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>as</b> Roman ones.|$|E

25|$|Some operations, like {{finding a}} {{discrete}} logarithm or a quadratic congruence {{appear to be}} <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> integer factorization and thus are {{a starting point for}} cryptographic algorithms and encryption. These problems might be NP-intermediate.|$|E
25|$|NP-hard {{problems}} are those at least <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> NP problems, i.e., all NP {{problems can be}} reduced (in polynomial time) to them. NP-hard problems need not be in NP, i.e., they need not have solutions verifiable in polynomial time.|$|E

25|$|The ponds {{created by}} well-maintained dams help isolate the beavers' homes, which are called lodges. These are created from severed {{branches}} and mud. The beavers cover their lodges late each autumn with fresh mud, which freezes when frosts arrive. The mud becomes almost <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> stone, thereby preventing wolves and wolverines from penetrating the lodge.|$|E

25|$|The halting {{problem is}} an {{analogous}} example {{from the field}} of centralised computation: we are given a computer program and the task is to decide whether it halts or runs forever.

25|$|As {{one of the}} Protestant {{criticisms of}} Roman Catholics was {{that many of the}} {{practices}} of the Catholic Church were departures from the practice of the early Church, he sought to demonstrate continuity of Catholicism with the primitive Church. Britannia Sancta was published in 1745. With this book Challoner hoped to promote among Catholics a pride in their ancestry, and to show them that their present sufferings were not <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> those endured by the martyrs and saints of the past.|$|E
25|$|The kit {{is made up}} of a jersey or {{shirt with}} sleeves, shorts, socks, {{shinguards}} made out of rubber or plastic, and shoes with rubber soles. The goalkeeper is allowed to wear long trousers and a different coloured kit to distinguish themself from the other players on the team and the referee. Goalkeeper is also allowed to wear elbow pads because the surface is about <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> a tennis court or basketball court. Jewellery is not allowed, nor are other items that could be dangerous to the player wearing the item or to other active participants.|$|E
25|$|Because {{teeth are}} very resistant, often {{preserved}} when bones are not, and reflect the diet {{of the host}} organism, they are very valuable to archaeologists and palaeontologists. Early fish such as the thelodonts had scales composed of dentine and an enamel-like compound, suggesting that the origin of teeth was from scales which were retained in the mouth. Fish {{as early as the}} late Cambrian had dentine in their exoskeleton, which may have functioned in defense or for sensing their environment. Dentine can be <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> the rest of teeth and is composed of collagen fibres, reinforced with hydroxyapatite.|$|E
