Non-combatant builders deliver the resources to the Town Center from mines, from which gold is dug, and forests, where wood is chopped. As both <b>are</b> <b>limited</b> <b>resources</b> which become exhausted during the game, players must collect them efficiently, and also retain forests as defensive walls in the early game when combat forces are small.|$|E

This illustration of cows eating grass is scramble competition because there <b>are</b> <b>limited</b> <b>resources,</b> there is only so much grass to be eaten before all the food resource is depleted. Additionally, {{there is no way}} that others can limit the amount of resources or the access to resources that the other cows receive.|$|E
50|$|The goal of {{life history}} theory is to {{understand}} the variation in such life history strategies.

Without constraints, the highest fitness would belong to a Darwinian Demon, a hypothetical organism for whom such trade-offs do not exist. The key to life history theory is that there <b>are</b> <b>limited</b> <b>resources</b> available, and focusing on only a few life history characteristics is necessary.|$|E

50|$|Postmortem brain samples <b>are</b> <b>limited</b> <b>resources,</b> {{because it}} is {{extremely}} difficult for a researcher {{to get a hold of}} an individual’s brain. The researchers ask their participants or the families to consent to allowing them to study the loved ones brain, however there has been a falling rates of consent in the last few years. Subsequently researchers have to use indirect methods to study the locations and processes of the brain. Another limitation to postmortem studies is the continuous funding and the time it takes to conduct a longitudinal study. Postmortem longitudinal studies usually take place at the time of assessment until the time of death about 20-30 years.|$|E
50|$|Currently, there <b>are</b> <b>limited</b> <b>resources</b> for Latina {{immigrants}} in the United States. As explained in Motivations of Immigration, many women come to the United States for a better education, among other factors. The Institute for Women's Policy Research explains the workings of organizations aimed to support the struggles of Latina immigrants. The IWPR states that growing organizations are currently providing English tutors and access to education. Programs specifically for Latina (and Latino) immigrants now use an adaptation tactic of teaching, rather than an assimilation ideology to help this population adjust to American life. Programs like these include Casa Latina Programs, providing education on English, workers' rights, and the consumer culture of America.|$|E
