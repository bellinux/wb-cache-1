5|$|Thorpe's first {{international}} appearance {{in his home}} country, at the 1998 World Championships in Perth, began with the 4×200m freestyle relay. Swimming the third leg after Klim and Hackett, Thorpe broke away from 200m butterfly Olympic champion Tom Malchow to set a split time of 1min 47.67s, just 0.26 seconds slower than Klim's winning time in the 200m final. By the end of Thorpe's leg, the Australians were two seconds ahead of the world record pace, and three seconds ahead of the Americans, having extended the lead by two body lengths. Although anchorman Kowalski finished outside the world record, {{it was the first}} time that Australia had won the event <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>level</b> since 1956. Thorpe was ranked fourth in the world before the 400m final, which Hackett led from the outset. Hackett established a comfortable 2.29s lead over Thorpe by the 300m mark, and although Thorpe reduced the margin to 1.53s at the 350m mark, Hackett led until Thorpe passed him on the final stroke. Thorpe's time was the fourth fastest in history and made him the youngest ever male individual world champion, aged 15 years and 3 months.|$|E

25|$|Lomborg's main {{argument}} is {{that the vast majority}} of environmental problems—such as pollution, water shortages, deforestation, and species loss, as well as population growth, hunger, and AIDS—are area-specific and highly correlated with poverty. Therefore, challenges to human prosperity are essentially logistical matters, and can be solved largely through economic and social development. Concerning problems that are more pressing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>level,</b> such as the depletion of fossil fuels and global warming, Lomborg argues that these issues are often overstated and that recommended policies are often inappropriate if assessed against alternatives.|$|E
40|$|AbstractImage {{motion is}} {{initially}} detected locally. Local motion signals are then integrated across space {{in order to}} specify <b>the</b> <b>global</b> motion of objects or surfaces. It {{is well known that}} prolonged exposure to motion causes adaptation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> local motion level. We have investigated whether adaptation also occurs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>global</b> motion <b>level.</b> We have devised a global motion stimulus (a random dot kinematogram) which has equal motion energy in opposite directions but nonetheless gives rise to <b>global</b> motion perception. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> local motion level, adaptation to this stimulus should cause equal adaptation in both directions and should not give rise to an aftereffect. Any aftereffect seen must therefore be attributable to adaptation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>global</b> motion <b>level.</b> We find that following adaptation to this stimulus, judgements of the perceived direction of a test pattern are systematically biased towards the direction opposite to the adapting direction, suggesting that adaptation does occur at a level of visual processing at which global motion is represented...|$|R

25|$|The key {{challenge}} of the global commons is the design of governance structures and management systems capable of addressing the complexity of multiple public and private interests, subject to often unpredictable changes, ranging from the local to the global level. As with global public goods, management of the global commons requires pluralistic legal entities, usually international and supranational, public and private, structured to match {{the diversity of interests}} and the type of resource to be managed, and stringent enough with adequate incentives to ensure compliance. Such management systems are necessary to avoid, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>level,</b> the classic tragedy of the commons, in which common resources become overexploited.|$|E
25|$|Animal {{husbandry}} and Integrated Crop Management (ICM) {{often are}} just two branches of one agricultural enterprise. In modern agriculture, animal husbandry and crop production must be understood as interlinked sectors which cannot be looked at in isolation, as the context of agricultural systems leads to tight interdependencies. Uncoupling animal husbandry from arable production (too high stocking rates) is therefore not considered {{in accordance with the}} principles and objectives of Integrated Farming (Lütke Entrup et al., 1998 1). Accordingly, holistic concepts for Integrated Farming or Integrated Farm Management such as the EISA Integrated Farming Framework, and the concept of sustainable agriculture are increasingly developed, promoted and implemented <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E
40|$|Jacks et al. (2011) offer {{a method}} to measure trade costs that relies {{exclusively}} on bilateral exports and GDP statistics. They argue that the reduction in trade costs was the main driving force of trade growth during the first globalization (1870 – 1913), whereas economic expansion was the main driving force during the second globalization (1950 – 2000). This potentially major result {{is driven by the}} use of an ad hoc aggregation method of bilateral trade costs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> country and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>levels.</b> What Jacks et al. (2011) capture is that some pairs of countries experienced faster trade growth in the first globalization than in the second globalization. More generally, we cast doubts on the possibility to reach conclusions on aggregate costs with a method that excludes a priori changes in non-trade costs determinants of openness rates and hence can only rephrase the information contained in them...|$|R

2500|$|Theoretically, any {{of these}} {{structures}} may occur at any given scale.

2500|$|Third, {{the paradox}} assumes a closed economy in which savings are not {{invested}} abroad (to fund exports of local production abroad). Thus, while the paradox may hold <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>level,</b> {{it need not}} hold at the local or national level: if one nation increases savings, this can be offset by trading partners consuming a greater amount relative to their own production, i.e., if the saving nation increases exports, and its partners increase imports. This criticism is not very controversial, and is generally accepted by Keynesian economists as well, who {{refer to it as}} [...] "exporting one's way out of a recession". They further note that this frequently occurs in concert with currency devaluation (hence increasing exports and decreasing imports), and cannot work as a solution to a global problem, because the global economy is a closed system – not every nation can increase net exports.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} key {{differences}} in {{management of resources}} in the global commons {{from those of the}} commons, in general. There are obvious differences in scale of both the resources and the number of users at the local versus the global level. [...] Also, there are differences in the shared culture and expectations of resource users; more localized commons users tend to be more homogeneous and global users more heterogeneous. This contributes to differences in the possibility and time it takes for new learning about resource usage to occur at the different levels. Moreover, global resource pools {{are less likely to be}} relatively stable and the dynamics are less easily understood. Many of the global commons are non-renewable on human time scales. Thus, resource degradation is more likely to be the result of unintended consequences that are unforeseen, not immediately observable, or not easily understood. For example, the carbon dioxide emissions that drive climate change continue to do so for at least a millennium after they enter the atmosphere and species extinctions last forever. [...] Importantly, because there are significant differences in the benefits, costs, and interests <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>level,</b> there are significant differences in externalities between more local resource uses and uses of global-level resources.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to Lebanon's 2009 general {{elections}} (and its inclusion of Hezbollah), Livni [...] "acknowledged an important principle" [...] from U.S. President Barack Obama's then-recent speech in Cairo that [...] "Elections alone {{do not make}} true democracy." [...] She explained her position in a New York Times op-ed by alluding to her experience as Israel's justice minister when Hamas participated in Palestinian elections in 2006: [...] "At the time, the counterargument was that the very participation in elections would act as a moderating force on extremist groups. With more accountability, such groups would be tempted to abandon their militant approach {{in favor of a}} purely political platform. But this analysis ignored the possibility that some radical groups sought participation in the democratic process not to forsake their violent agenda but to advance it." [...] Livni advocated that [...] "the international community must adopt <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>level</b> what true democracies apply at the national one—a universal code for participation in democratic elections. This would include requiring every party running for office to renounce violence, pursue its aims by peaceful means and commit to binding laws and international agreements."
