5|$|This {{series of}} Blackadder {{was one of}} the first {{television}} programmes in Britain to be made and transmitted with stereo sound, using the NICAM digital system, even though most viewers could only afford, or were only <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> due to their location, the standard FM mono audio carrier signal.|$|E
5|$|Also {{beginning}} in 2012, sighted guides became eligible to receive medals in certain events; sighted goalkeepers in 5-a-side football, along with guides and pilots in athletics and cycling and boccia assistants were now <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> medals for their contributions. Previously {{in the case}} of tandem cycling, where a visually-impaired rider takes the rear of the bike with a sighted pilot in front, only the visually-impaired rider actually received a medal.|$|E

5|$|At landfall, Fern had {{weakened}} to {{a strong}} tropical storm as it moved further inland. Because the center of Fern was elongated, it was still <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and as a result, weakening was slow. Between September 10 and September 11, Fern bypassed Corpus Christi, Texas, before dissipating as a tropical depression after crossing the Rio Grande into northern Mexico.|$|E
5|$|During {{the time}} of the earthquake, others {{believed}} that the destruction was a result of an underground nuclear explosion. Igor Nesterov, head of seismology of USSR, said the Leninakan seismic station was destroyed so there was no way of knowing whether it received reports of an earthquake coming its way, although Nesterovs' colleagues later said the station was not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> reports {{because of the lack of}} instruments it carried.|$|E
5|$|N: Although films {{produced}} {{inside the}} United States {{are not eligible}} for consideration for the Best Foreign Language Film Award, those produced in U.S. overseas possessions are. Puerto Rico, an unincorporated territory of the United States, was thus <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> a nomination for What Happened to Santiago (1989). However, this rule was changed in 2011 barring Puerto Rican submissions.|$|E

5|$|According to the Constitution of 1831, the Belgian {{government}} {{was allowed to}} override {{the wishes of the}} King if he had been declared incompetent to reign. On 28 May 1940, under pressure from the French government, the Pierlot government in France declared the King to be under the power of the invaders and unfit to reign according to article 82, providing strong legal foundations and making itself the only official source of government. The government, however, refused to declare a republic. Although the King technically remained the only person <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> diplomatic legations and conclude treaties, the government in exile was able to do both during the war independently.|$|E
5|$|His last novel, Hamlet oder Die lange Nacht nimmt ein Ende (Tales of a Long Night), was {{published}} in 1956, and was favorably received. Döblin's remaining years were marked by poor health (he had Parkinson's disease) and lengthy stays in multiple clinics and hospitals, including his alma mater, Freiburg University. Through the intervention of Theodor Heuss and Joachim Tiburtius, he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> more money from the Berlin office in charge of compensating victims of Nazi persecution; this, and a literary prize from the Mainz Academy in the sum of 10,000 DM helped finance his growing medical expenses.|$|E
5|$|In 1938 and 1939, Adolf Hitler's Third Reich forbade three laureates from Germany (Richard Kuhn, Adolf Friedrich Johann Butenandt, and Gerhard Domagk) from {{accepting}} their prizes. Each man {{was later}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> the diploma and medal. Even though Sweden was officially neutral during the Second World War, the prizes were awarded irregularly. In 1939, the Peace Prize was not awarded. No prize was awarded in any category from 1940–42, {{due to the}} occupation of Norway by Germany. In the subsequent year, all prizes were awarded except those for literature and peace.|$|E

5|$|King Edward died in 1553, {{followed}} by the accession of Mary I of England, who opposed the Protestant reformers. Vermigli was placed under house arrest for six months, and his Catholic opponents at Oxford would likely have had him executed, as Cranmer eventually was in 1556. Despite this risk, he agreed to a public disputation with Cranmer against the new Catholic establishment, but this never came to fruition because Cranmer was imprisoned. Vermigli was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> permission from the Privy Council to leave England, and was advised by Cranmer to do so.|$|E
5|$|Runway 09R/27L, the {{original}} and primary runway, is {{long enough to be}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> the Airbus A380, the world's largest passenger aircraft. Originally a taxiway, runway 09L/27R was inaugurated in February 2012. Its shorter length and width allow it to handle smaller aircraft such as the Airbus A340 and Boeing 747. It is mainly used when runway 09R/27L is undergoing maintenance, and as air traffic to the airport rises it will be used more often. North of these runways are the three parking aprons: the cargo, passenger terminal and MRO aprons. The passenger terminal apron contains parking stands on both the north and south sides of the terminal.|$|E
5|$|The MSC Railway was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> and {{despatch}} goods {{trains to}} and from all the UK's main line railway systems, using connecting junctions at three points in the terminal docks. Two were {{to the north of}} the canal, operated by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway and the London and North Western Railway. The third was to the south, operated by the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC), where by the MSC Railway had taken over the old and abandoned route of the CLC, giving them a monopoly on traffic to the new soap works and steel mill.|$|E

5|$|The first {{components}} of the Mulberry harbours were brought across on D+1 and the structures were in use for unloading by mid-June. One was constructed at Arromanches by the British, the other at Omaha by the Americans. Severe storms on 19 June interrupted the landing of supplies and destroyed the Omaha harbour. The repaired Arromanches harbour was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> around 6,000 tons of materiel daily and was in continuous use {{for the next ten}} months, but most shipments were brought in over the beaches until the port of Cherbourg was cleared of mines and obstructions on 16 July.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{the credit}} {{was given to}} Augustus for each {{subsequent}} Roman military victory after this time, {{because the majority of}} Rome's armies were stationed in imperial provinces commanded by Augustus through the legatus who were deputies of the princeps in the provinces. Moreover, if a battle was fought in a Senatorial province, Augustus' proconsular imperium maius allowed him to take command of (or credit for) any major military victory. This meant that Augustus was the only individual <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> a triumph, a tradition that began with Romulus, Rome's first King and first triumphant general. Lucius Cornelius Balbus was the last man outside Augustus' family to receive this award, in 19BC. (Balbus was the nephew of Julius Caesar's great agent, who was governor of Africa and conqueror of the Garamantes.) Tiberius, Augustus' eldest son by marriage to Livia, was the only other general to receive a triumph—for victories in Germania in 7BC.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the storm, the French Red Cross {{supplied}} 1.5tons of supplies to approximately 10,000people victims of Kalunde. Mauritius Deputy Prime Minister Paul Berenger visited the island Friday to assess the damage while another official called on Mauritius officials to contribute to a cyclone relief fund for the island group. Twenty technicians were also sent to the area in wake of the storm. Officials estimated that it would take five weeks for power to be fully restored across Rodrigues. They also stated that if a similar situation took place and people were in need of emergency services, no one would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> them. Furthermore, they proposed that bridges would to be built in order to forestall roads from being washed out again.|$|E

5|$|Sid {{finds the}} eighth spirit at the crater {{site of the}} alien asteroid's impact on Earth. He lowers a {{shielded}} vehicle, with Aki and Gray aboard, into the crater to locate the final spirit. Just before they can reach it, Hein fires the Zeus cannon into the crater, not only destroying the eighth spirit but also revealing the Phantom Gaia. Aki has {{a vision of the}} Phantom home planet, where she is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> the eighth spirit from the alien particles in herself. When Aki awakens, she and Gray combine it with the other seven. Hein continues to fire the Zeus cannon despite overheating warnings and unintentionally destroys the cannon and himself. Gray sacrifices himself as a medium needed to physically transmit the completed spirit into the alien Gaia. The Earth's Gaia is returned to normal as the Phantoms ascend into space, finally at peace. Aki is pulled from the crater holding Gray's body, and is seen looking into the newly liberated world.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of San Martín repeated {{some of the}} ideas outlined in the Operations plan, drafted by Mariano Moreno {{at the beginning of the}} war. A combination of incentives, confiscations and planned economy allowed the country to provision the army: gunpowder, pieces of artillery, mules and horses, food, military clothing, etc. Mining increased, with increased extraction of lead, copper, saltpeter, sulfur and borax, which had several usages and improved local finances. Hundreds of women wove clothing used by the soldiers. Father José Luis Beltrán headed a military factory of 700 men, which produced rifles and horseshoes. San Martín stayed on good terms with both the {{government of}} Buenos Aires and the provincial caudillos, without fully allying with either one. He was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> provisions from both. He considered that the war of independence took priority over the civil wars.|$|E
5|$|Empire: Total War {{ships with}} nine {{different}} versions of box art, eight of which represent the major faction for the market the game is sold in, and one general international version. For instance, German customers are presented artwork displaying colours with the Prussian eagle and Prussian army uniforms, whilst the American artwork shows the American revolutionaries and the Betsy Ross flag. A special edition version of Empire: Total War entitled Special Forces incorporates six elite faction-specific units: HMS Victory, the French Irish Brigade, Spanish guerillas, Gurkha infantry, Rogers' Rangers and the Ottoman Ribauldequin. Additionally, three retailers were provided with a special unit for customers to receive; Amazon.com customers were given the Dahomey Amazons, buyers from Best Buy were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> the USS Constitution and customers buying from Game received the Death's Head Hussars. A further 14 units were added {{with the objective of}} increasing graphical and unit variety among the factions. These 14 units were released as part of the game's 1.3 patch in June 2009; accompanying the update was a second set of 14 units, released as downloadable content for purchase.|$|E
30|$|Endometriosis as {{a disease}} has an abysmally low profile in health care circles despite the obvious morbidity, {{and it is time}} that it was much better placed on the agenda of women’s health care needs. Women should be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>received</b> skilled advice and help with {{appropriate}} support to help them deal with this debilitating condition. The need for specialist centres dealing with endometriosis is every bit as real and perhaps more pressing than cancer services, since the morbidity of endometriosis lasts much longer than that of cancer, and endometriosis is much more common than cancer.|$|R
