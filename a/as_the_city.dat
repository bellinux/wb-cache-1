5|$|As of 2015, {{the city}} began seeing modest {{population}} growth of 286 {{for the first}} time in nearly fifty years.

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> became {{increasingly}} congested further {{means of transportation}} were sought, eventually leading to horse-drawn trolleys. These, in turn, were replaced by electric trolleys that traveled down the main streets of downtown Newark, including Broad Street, and up Market Street near the courthouse The trolley cars {{did not last long}} as the personal motor vehicle quickly gained popularity and slowly made the trolley system seem like a burden.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> {{has a high}} {{proportion}} of public servants, the Commonwealth Government contributes the largest percentage of Gross State Product and is the largest single employer in Canberra, although no longer the majority employer. Compared to the national averages, the unemployment rate is lower and the average income higher; tertiary education levels are higher, while the population is younger. Property prices are relatively high, in part due to comparatively restrictive development regulations.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Toronto {{expanded}} eastward and encroached on the estate, Elizabeth and Wellington Ashbridge subdivided {{and sold}} off {{much of the}} family's land for residential subdivisions.

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> suburbs {{developed}} in the 1960s and '70s, most hotels moved outside of downtown. Rehabilitation of the Riley Center in 2006 has increased demand and a push for a new downtown hotel. The Threefoot Building has been proposed for redevelopment for this purpose, but restoration efforts stalled with a change in city administrations. The Threefoot Preservation Society was formed in 2013 to raise public awareness {{and support for the}} building's renovation, featuring tours of the first floor and anniversary events.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} urban rivers, the Frome has {{suffered}} from pollution, but several stretches run through parks and reserves that sustain a range of wildlife. The power of the water was harnessed in many watermills and {{the area around the}} river mouth was developed as shipyards by the eighteenth century. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Bristol developed in the nineteenth and twentieth century, flooding became a major problem, remedied by the construction of storm drains and diversions.|$|E

5|$|In January 2007, {{the city}} council decided that a branch was to be built during {{construction}} at Nørrebro, to allow a future branch line from the City Circle Line towards Brønshøj. The {{first part of this}} line was intended to be constructed at the same time <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>City</b> Circle Line, to avoid a multitude-higher construction cost and long interruptions of operations later. This did not involve a final decision, only an option for future construction. The Herlev/Brønshøj line was ultimately dropped <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>City</b> of Copenhagen withdrew its share {{of the cost of the}} Nørrebro branch chamber in its 2009 budget, and the state refused to continue the project. Any branch to the Herlev / Brønshøj region would now require a shutdown of the City Circle Line for an extended period of time.|$|E
