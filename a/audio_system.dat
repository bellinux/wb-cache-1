5|$|Lotus' {{synthetic}} {{sound system}} was {{incorporated in the}} Lotus Evora 414E Hybrid, a concept plug-in hybrid unveiled at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show. The system, called HALOsonic Internal and External Electronic Sound Synthesis, is a suite of noise solutions that uses patented technologies from Lotus and Harman International. The <b>audio</b> <b>system</b> generates engine sounds inside the vehicle through the <b>audio</b> <b>system.</b> The system also generates the external sound through speakers mounted at {{the front and rear}} to provide a warning to increase pedestrian safety. The system comes with four driver-selectable engine sounds, two of which have been designed to have characteristics of a multi-cylinder conventional V6 and V12 engine.|$|E
5|$|The Futura model gained power {{adjustable}} pedals, {{and side}} airbags, with a DVD entertainment system being offered on upmarket trim levels. The XR8 sedan variant also received the premium <b>audio</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|A MOS Technology 6502 {{chip that}} {{operates}} at 894kHz generates the sound effects, and a speech synthesizer by Votrax generates Q*bert's incoherent expressions. The <b>audio</b> <b>system</b> uses 128B of random-access memory and 4KB of erasable programmable {{read only memory}} to store the sound data and code to implement it. Like other Gottlieb games, the sound system was thoroughly tested to ensure it would handle daily usage. In retrospect, audio engineer David Thiel commented that such testing minimized time available for creative designing.|$|E
40|$|The advancements of {{computational}} {{power in}} low cost FPGAs are giving the opportunityto implement real-time compensation of loudspeakers and <b>audio</b> <b>systems.</b> The need for expensive commercial <b>audio</b> <b>systems</b> is reduced when the fidelity ofmuch cheaper <b>audio</b> <b>systems</b> easily {{can be improved}} by real-time compensation. The topic of this thesis is to investigate and evaluate methods for digital compensationof distortion in <b>audio</b> <b>systems.</b> More specifically, a VHDL module isimplemented to, when necessary, alleviate the problem of drastically deterioratingfidelity of the bass appearing when the input power is too high...|$|R
40|$|The spatial {{quality of}} {{automotive}} <b>audio</b> <b>systems</b> is often compromised {{due to their}} unideal listening environments. Automotive <b>audio</b> <b>systems</b> {{need to be developed}} quickly due to industry demands. A suitable perceptual model could evaluate the spatial quality of automotive <b>audio</b> <b>systems</b> with similar reliability to formal listening tests but take less time. Such a model is developed in this research project by adapting an existing model of spatial quality for automotive audio use. The requirements for the adaptation were investigated in a literature review. A perceptual model called QESTRAL was reviewed, which predicts the overall spatial quality of domestic multichannel <b>audio</b> <b>systems.</b> It was determined that automotive <b>audio</b> <b>systems</b> are likely to be impaired in terms of the spatial attributes that were not considered in developing the QESTRAL model, but metrics are available that might predict these attributes. To establish whether the QESTRAL model in its current form can accurately predict the overall spatial quality of automotive <b>audio</b> <b>systems,</b> MUSHRA listening tests using headphone auralisation with head tracking were conducted to collect results to be compared against predictions by the model. Based on guideline criteria, the model in its current form could not accurately predict the overall spatial quality of automotive <b>audio</b> <b>systems.</b> To improve prediction performance, the QESTRAL model was recalibrated and modified using existing metrics of the model, those that were proposed from the literature review, and newly developed metrics. The most important metrics for predicting the overall spatial quality of automotive <b>audio</b> <b>systems</b> included those that were interaural cross-correlation (IACC) based, relate to localisation of the frontal audio scene, and account for the perceived scene width in front of the listener. Modifying the model for automotive <b>audio</b> <b>systems</b> did not invalidate its use for domestic <b>audio</b> <b>systems.</b> The resulting model predicts the overall spatial quality of 2 - and 5 -channel automotive <b>audio</b> <b>systems</b> with a cross-validation performance of R^ 2 = 0. 85 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 11. 03...|$|R
50|$|In 2006, 76% of Alpine's {{revenues}} {{came from}} OEM sales. BMW and Honda have offered unbranded <b>audio</b> <b>systems</b> manufactured by Alpine, and {{companies such as}} Dodge and Jaguar Cars have offered co-branded Alpine <b>audio</b> <b>systems</b> in their vehicles.|$|R
5|$|The One’s <b>audio</b> <b>system</b> {{incorporates}} two front-facing BoomSound stereo speakers, Beats Audio software equalizer, and HDR audio recording. The BoomSound {{stereo system}} {{is controlled by}} two five-volt NXP TFA9887 integrated circuits combining NXP’s CoolFlux audio DSP, a class-D amplifier with current sensing, and a DC-to-DC converter to boost the output level of micro-speakers up to five times (up to 2.6W RMS) without damaging the driver.|$|E
5|$|LucasArts began {{development}} {{of the game in}} 1992 with the intention to use new settings and characters after the success of the past Maniac Mansion and Monkey Island adventure titles. Series creator Steve Purcell, then a LucasArts employee, was one of the lead designers on the project. Sam & Max Hit the Road is the ninth game to use the SCUMM adventure game engine, and also integrated the iMUSE <b>audio</b> <b>system</b> developed by Michael Land and Peter McConnell. The game {{was one of the first}} to incorporate full voice talent for its characters; the two title characters were voiced by professional voice actors Bill Farmer and Nick Jameson.|$|E
5|$|Mini Metro is {{a puzzle}} {{strategy}} video game developed by indie development team Dinosaur Polo Club. Players are tasked with constructing an efficient rail transit network for {{a rapidly growing}} city. Stations are represented by differently shaped nodes and players can build tracks to connect them by drawing lines. Levels are based on real cities {{and the appearance of}} stations and passengers is procedurally generated. The game's visual style makes use of bold colours and simple geometry to replicate the appearance of modern transit maps. The game uses a procedural <b>audio</b> <b>system</b> to generate sounds based on the player actions and transit network. The rhythms and sounds created took inspiration from works of minimal music.|$|E

5|$|The {{brothers}} hired external help {{to address}} {{two of their}} initial issues: art and audio. Jamie Churchman, a former colleague at Sidhe, oversaw the visual design for Mini Metro and {{also contributed to the}} game design. They approached American composer Disasterpeace to work on the game's audio. He developed a procedural <b>audio</b> <b>system</b> that would generate sounds based on events in the game. Each level in the game has a corresponding set of rhythms and sounds; the harmonic structure of these elements changes based on {{the size and shape of}} the player's subways system. The audio was inspired by minimalism and the works of Philip Glass and Steve Reich.|$|E
