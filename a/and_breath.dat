5|$|In early 11th century, the Persian scholar Al Biruni visited India, {{lived with}} Hindus for 16 years, {{and with their}} help {{translated}} several significant Sanskrit works into Arabic and Persian languages. One of these was Patanjali's Yogasutras. Al Biruni's translation preserved many of the core themes of Pata√±jali 's Yoga philosophy, but certain sutras and analytical commentaries were restated making it more consistent with Islamic monotheistic theology. Al Biruni's version of Yoga Sutras reached Persia and Arabian peninsula by about 1050 AD. Later, in the 16th century, the hath yoga text Amritakunda was translated into Arabic and then Persian. Yoga was, however, not accepted by mainstream Sunni and Shia Islam. Minority Islamic sects such as the mystic Sufi movement, particularly in South Asia, adopted Indian yoga practises, including postures <b>and</b> <b>breath</b> control. Muhammad Ghawth, a Shattari Sufi {{and one of the}} translators of yoga text in 16th century, drew controversy for his interest in yoga and was persecuted for his Sufi beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Persona was {{the first}} {{role-playing}} entry in the Megami Tensei series {{to be released in}} the west, with the first Megami Tensei release being action game Jack Bros. in 1995. While the main Megami Tensei series' use of Christian imagery made it unsuitable for localization at the time, Persona employed a different naming system to make it more acceptable. Persona was localized by Atlus' then-new North American branch Atlus USA. Persona was chosen as a series that could help define the company and compete with the likes of Final Fantasy, Suikoden <b>and</b> <b>Breath</b> of Fire. The team that localized Persona was quite small, which made the process quite difficult: not only was there a large amount of text to translate, but the team needed to adjust or change the Japanese references as they feared it might alienate western players. Among the changes were altering the player character's hairstyle, the ethnic origins of multiple characters, the character and location names, and multiple pieces of dialogue. The entire Snow Queen route was also cut from the game, leaving only the SEBEC story route open for exploration.|$|E

5|$|For a long time, the Megami Tensei {{franchise}} was not {{exported to}} western territories despite {{there being a}} recognized market. The original reasons were the heavy religious themes and symbols used, which were considered taboo in western game markets, and Nintendo's strict content guidelines for overseas releases. Later, many of these early works were prevented from coming overseas due to their age, which would have put them at a disadvantage in the modern gaming market. Early entries on the PlayStation were also blocked by Sony of America's then-current approval policies. The first title in the franchise to be localized was Jack Bros.; the first role-playing game in the franchise to receive an overseas release was the first Persona game. This was done to give Atlus' North American branch a flagship RPG franchise that could compete {{with the likes of}} Final Fantasy, Suikoden <b>and</b> <b>Breath</b> of Fire. According to Okada, the naming of creatures and enemies was adjusted from the main series and original Japanese release of Persona to make it more acceptable for an overseas audience. Though it managed to establish the franchise overseas, the localization was a taxing task due to a small staff and the need to change multiple aspects to suit a North American audience, including removing references to Japanese culture and changing one character from Japanese to African-American. The first Persona 2 title, Innocent Sin, needed to be passed over due to shortage of manpower and the fact that development was focused on the second title, Eternal Punishment.|$|E

25|$|Trimethylamine {{builds up}} in the bodies of {{patients}} with trimethylaminuria. The trimethylamine is released in the person's sweat, urine, reproductive fluids, <b>and</b> <b>breath,</b> giving off a strong fishy or body odor.

The vocal folds are brought together primarily by the action of the interarytenoid muscles, which pull the arytenoid cartilages together.|$|E

25|$|The branch's stated aim was {{to publish}} {{high-quality}} Japanese games in North America. While Atlus had become famous in Japan for the Megami Tensei role-playing franchise, the series was deemed too dark to be released overseas despite a recognized market: {{a major part of}} this was their use of religious imagery and taboo, which ran counter to potential publishers' content guidelines for overseas releases. It was eventually decided to bring over entries from the franchise to help establish Atlus in the West, as they did not have a role-playing series to compete with other major series such as Final Fantasy, Suikoden <b>and</b> <b>Breath</b> of Fire.|$|E
25|$|Trimethylaminuria (TMAU; primary trimethylaminuria), {{also known}} as fish odor {{syndrome}} or fish malodor syndrome, is a rare metabolic disorder that causes a defect in the normal production of an enzyme named flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3). When FMO3 is not working correctly or if not enough enzyme is produced, the body loses the ability to properly convert trimethylamine (TMA) from precursor compounds in food digestion into trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), through a process called N-oxidation. Trimethylamine then builds up and is released in the person's sweat, urine, <b>and</b> <b>breath,</b> giving off a strong fishy odor or strong body odor. A variant of TMAU (secondary trimethylaminuria or TMAU2) exists {{where there is no}} genetic cause, yet excessive TMA is secreted, possibly due to intestinal dysbiosis, altered metabolism, or hormonal causes.|$|E
25|$|Mutations in the FMO3 gene, {{which is}} {{found on the}} long arm of {{chromosome}} 1, cause trimethylaminuria. The FMO3 gene makes an enzyme that breaks down nitrogen-containing compounds from the diet, including trimethylamine. These compounds are produced by bacteria in the intestine as they digest proteins from eggs, meat, soy, and other foods. Normally, the FMO3 enzyme converts fishy-smelling trimethylamine into trimethylamine N-oxide which has no odor. If the enzyme is missing or its activity is reduced because of a mutation in the FMO3 gene, trimethylamine is not broken down and instead builds up in the body. As the compound is released in a person's sweat, urine, <b>and</b> <b>breath,</b> it causes the strong odor characteristic of trimethylaminuria. Researchers believe that stress and diet {{also play a role}} in triggering symptoms.|$|E

He later attended Lane Technical High School, where he helped to develop his lung power <b>and</b> <b>breath</b> control by joining the track and field and basketball teams. He realized he wanted to be a singer when he missed time in school to see Al Jolson's current talking picture, The Singing Fool. Jolson would later visit Laine when both were filming pictures in 1949, and at about this time, Jolson remarked that Laine was going to put all the other singers out of business.|$|E
25|$|According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) (2007), benzene {{is both an}} anthropogenically {{produced}} and naturally occurring chemical from processes that include: volcanic eruptions, wild fires, synthesis of chemicals such as phenol, production of synthetic fibers, and fabrication of rubbers, lubricants, pesticides, medications, and dyes. The major sources of benzene exposure are tobacco smoke, automobile service stations, exhaust from motor vehicles, and industrial emissions; however, ingestion and dermal absorption of benzene can also occur through contact with contaminated water. Benzene is hepatically metabolized and excreted in the urine. Measurement of air and water levels of benzene is accomplished through collection via activated charcoal tubes, which are then analyzed with a gas chromatograph. The measurement of benzene in humans can be accomplished via urine, blood, <b>and</b> <b>breath</b> tests; however, all of these have their limitations because benzene is rapidly metabolized in the human body.|$|E

As Bruckheimer explained to EW, [...] "I don't {{think they had}} breast augmentation in the 1700s, [...] So it's natural for casting people to say, 'We want real people.'" [...] Marshall invited Spanish-French actress √Ästrid Berg√®s-Frisbey to play Syrena after seeing her in a French magazine article on up-and-coming actresses. Berg√®s-Frisbey had to take lessons of English, swimming <b>and</b> <b>breath</b> control for the role.

500|$|In the table, when obstruents (stops, affricates, and fricatives) {{appear in}} pairs, such as , , and , {{the first is}} fortis (strong) {{and the second is}} lenis (weak). Fortis obstruents, such as [...] are {{pronounced}} with more muscular tension <b>and</b> <b>breath</b> force than lenis consonants, such as , and are always voiceless. Lenis consonants are partly voiced {{at the beginning and end}} of utterances, and fully voiced between vowels. Fortis stops such as [...] have additional articulatory or acoustic features in most dialects: they are aspirated [...] when they occur alone at the beginning of a stressed syllable, often unaspirated in other cases, and often unreleased [...] or pre-glottalised [...] at the end of a syllable. In a single-syllable word, a vowel before a fortis stop is shortened: thus nip has a noticeably shorter vowel (phonetically, but not phonemically) than nib [...] (see below).|$|E
500|$|In the wild, M. campanulae seal {{off their}} cells within the nest with natural resins found in plants and trees. In 2013, however, {{researchers}} {{reported that the}} bees had used synthetics, including caulk, to seal the cells. [...] Compositional analysis of these materials revealed calcium, titanium, and iron. [...] They resembled polyurethane-based sealants typically used in building construction. [...] It {{is not uncommon for}} insects to live inside found objects made of plastic. [...] However, these findings are the first known of insects actually building nests with plastic. [...] With help from citizen scientists in Toronto, over 200 nest boxes were placed throughout the city. [...] Scanning electron microscopy, x-ray microanalysis, and infrared microscopy were employed in identification of polymeric specimens. [...] Researchers suggest the bees' behavior may be an example of adaptive behavior. Since some of the bees were free of parasites, these novel and possibly more robust methods of nest building may offer additional protection. [...] Incorporation of plastic into the walls and sealants of the cell nests appeared to provide some protection against brood parasite invasion. [...] However, use of these more readily available synthetic materials, in an urban setting, may be incidental. [...] In fact, exposure of brood to polyurethane and polyethylene based plastics could be detrimental, as the Canadian team noted, since diffusion of moisture could be inhibited. [...] Some of the brood specimens were heavily affected by mold growth.

40|$|Synchronized {{intermittent}} mandatory ventilation (SIMV) intermixes assisted <b>and</b> spontaneous <b>breaths.</b> Its {{ability as}} a weaning technique has been questioned {{on the basis that}} patients show little adaptation to ventilator assistance. We studied inspiratory effort and patient-ventilator interaction at different levels (SIMV, 100, 50, and 0 %) of flow-triggered SIMV versus pressure-triggered SIMV in patients during the weaning period. The two triggering systems were evaluated during constant flow and constant pressure mandatory SIMV breaths. Inspiratory effort was estimated as the esophageal pressure time product (PTP) per <b>breath</b> (PTP/b) <b>and</b> per minute (PTP/min). The PTP/b and PTP/min of both mandatory <b>and</b> spontaneous <b>breaths</b> were significantly lower during flow triggering than during pressure triggering SIMV, irrespective of the ventilatory mode. During pressure-triggered SIMV PTP/b and PTP/min were identical for mandatory <b>and</b> spontaneous <b>breaths,</b> whereas during flow-triggered SIMV PTP/b and PTP/min were significantly lower for mandatory than for spontaneous breaths. This difference was greatest when flow triggering and constant pressure ventilation were associated.
