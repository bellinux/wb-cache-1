Within the Serjeants-at-Law were more distinct orders; the King's Serjeants, particularly favoured Serjeants-at-Law, and within that the King's Premier Serjeant, the Monarch's most favoured Serjeant, and the King's Ancient Serjeant, the oldest. Serjeants (except King's Serjeants) were created by Writ of Summons under the Great Seal of the Realm and wore a special and distinctive dress, the chief feature of which was the coif, a white lawn or silk skullcap, afterwards represented by a round piece of white lace {{at the top of the}} wig.|$|E

5|$|For {{almost all}} of their history, Serjeants at Law and King's Serjeants were the only advocates given rights of <b>audience</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Court of Common Pleas. Until the 17th century they were also first {{in the order of}} {{precedence}} in the Court of King's Bench and Court of Chancery, which gave them priority in motions before the court. Serjeants also had the privilege of being immune from most normal forms of lawsuit – they could only be sued by a writ from the Court of Chancery. It was held as an extension of this that servants of Serjeants could only be sued in the Common Pleas. As part of the Court of Common Pleas the Serjeants also performed some judicial duties, such as levying fines. In exchange for these privileges, Serjeants were expected to fulfil certain duties; firstly, that they represent anybody who asked regardless of their ability to pay, and secondly that, due to the small number of judges, they serve as deputy judges to hear cases when there was no judge available.|$|E

The article argues that widespread concerns about changing patterns of male and female work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1920 s and 1930 s were moderated by a popular construction of female love that emphasized heterosexual love and female employment as mutually exclusive. ‘Hit’ films with British <b>audiences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> period tended to feature a love-interest who ultimately declared her interest only in love while simultaneously renouncing her own access to wealth and status. Consequently, popular film became an important site for the articulation of interwar anxieties about gender and work as audiences consumed this repetitive narrative,...|$|R
