5|$|With demos completed, Green Day {{relocated}} to Los Angeles to continue {{work on the}} album. The group first recorded at Ocean Way Recording, then moved to Capitol Studios to complete the album. Cool brought multiple drum kits to the studio, including over seventy-five snares. Drum tracks were recorded on two-inch tape to produce a compressed sound and were transferred to Pro Tools to be digitally mixed with the other instruments. All drum tracks were produced at Ocean Way Studio B, picked for its high ceiling and acoustic tiling, which produced better sound. The songs were recorded in order as they appear on the track listing, which was a first for the trio. Each song would be recorded in its entirety before proceeding to the next. They reversed {{the order in which}} they recorded guitars and bass (recording the guitars first), as they heard that was how the Beatles recorded songs. Armstrong admitted that at points during the recording process he expressed fear <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> work before him, likening it to climbing a mountain.|$|E

Prior to joining MNF, his last trips outside of the studio were to cover Super Bowl XXXVI in New Orleans and to attend the NFL owners {{meetings}} in Orlando in 2006; Kornheiser both times traveled via train, though returned from the Orlando trip via airplane. On the April 6, 2006, edition of PTI, he expressed his dismay <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> travel required for MNF. Though he has mentioned on his radio program that he is taking steps to overcome his aviophobia, he in fact spent a five-week period on the road traveling to mainly western MNF sites, doing PTI via satellite.|$|E

Referring to Harrison's stated regret <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> echo Spector used on All Things Must Pass, compilation producer Giles Martin says of the song's sparse arrangement on Early Takes: [...] "I think this is really cool, it's got a good basic band groove, I {{think of it as}} George breaking down a wall of sound." ...|$|E

While noting that McCartney and Laine's relationship was beginning to unravel at this point, Sounes compares the freshness of these new recordings with the drawn-out sessions for Back to the Egg and writes that the album [...] "was now so overworked it might more aptly have been titled Over-Egged".

When asked about the dark nature of his songwriting and the cult following he was gaining, Smith said {{he felt it was}} merely a product of his writing songs that were strongly meaningful to him rather than anything contrived.

[...] 1UP.com described Age of Empires III as [...] "one of the most beautiful games you will put on your computer for the foreseeable future."

[...] Age of Empires III builds on and introduces new features to the prior release, Age of Mythology, such as the inclusion of the award-winning Havok physics simulation middleware game engine for the Windows version and PhysX for the Mac OS X. The innovative result is that pre-created animations are avoided; instead events are calculated according to the physics engine. Consequently, views of events like building destruction and tree felling are not pre-recorded. GameSpot also admired the graphics in the fourth release but complained about [...] "the awkward unit behavior." [...] Other graphical features of the game include bloom lighting and support for pixel shader 3.0.|$|E

In an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald, he said his editor [...] "Was like 'great, I love it! Let's do it. It was almost anticlimactic." [...] Wonder Woman's advocacy for gay rights was taken a step further in September 2016, when comic book writer Greg Rucka announced that she is canonically bisexual, according to her rebooted Rebirth origin. Rucka stated that in his opinion, she [...] "has to be" [...] queer and has [...] "obviously" [...] had same-sex relationships on an island surrounded by beautiful women. This follows the way Wonder Woman {{was written in the}} alternate continuity or non-canon Earth One by Grant Morrison, and fellow Wonder Woman writer Gail Simone staunchly supported Rucka's statement.

[...] The Commissioner of Internal Revenue argued that the taxpayer should be able to deduct only an amount based on the taxpayer’s historical cost basis of $20, rather than the $40 fair market value at the time the 1909 Act became effective. (Essentially, if the taxpayer were allowed to use the $40 per acre value as its basis rather than the actual $20 historical cost basis, a portion of the taxpayer’s gain [...] the increase in value from 1903 to December 31, 1908 [...] would go untaxed.) ...|$|E
500|$|The {{workload}} of the Registrar {{has increased}} {{over time as}} the university has increased in size and complexity. In 1914, the Registry had a staff of five; there were eight staff members in 1930 and forty in 1958. Typewriters were rare before 1925 and there was, until then, no diary of recurring dates, with everything depending (in {{the words of a}} later Registrar, Sir Douglas Veale, appointed in 1930) [...] "on someonegenerally the registrar's secretaryhappening to remember." [...] A commission headed by the former prime minister H. H. Asquith recommended in 1922 that Oxford should improve its administration and that the Registrar should become a more significant figure; Veale's appointment was a recognition of this need. In addition, external pressures from the requirements of the University Grants Committee and other governmental funding mechanisms also required more work from the Registrar and staff. As the historian Brian Harrison put it, under Veale (Registrar 1930–1958), Oxford's administration was [...] "edging ...slowly from decentralized amateurism towards centralized professionalism." [...] However, Veale's successor Sir Folliott Sandford was [...] "appalled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> paper", which was [...] "quite beyond [...] conception as a civil servant." [...] The growth in Oxford's administration led to a move in 1968 to purpose-built accommodation in Wellington Square: until that time, the administration had been housed in the Clarendon Building in the centre of Oxford next to the Bodleian Library. , there are 16 administrative sections for the university, and the heads of 12 of these report to the Registrar.

His plan backfires, however, and instead more people toast Robert. To get everybody's mind off of Robert, Andy decides to sing [...] "More Than Words" [...] as a duet with his father. This too goes awry as his father corrects his playing and singing, and ultimately decides to sing a duet with Walter Jr. instead of Andy. Upset, Andy takes his guitar and storms off. His father confronts him privately about his outburst, and when Andy admits to trying to win his father's affection, he reacts with annoyance. This conversation is overheard by the other staff on the baby monitor Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) brought for their daughter, and Pam quickly turns off the monitor to let Andy save face. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) confide to the camera that they now understand why Andy feels he needs to prove himself to everyone.
