5|$|There {{are several}} {{interpretations of the}} {{symbolism}} behind the commonly represented image of Kaali standing on Shiva's supine form. A common one is that Shiva symbolizes purusha, the universal unchanging aspect of reality, or pure consciousness. Kaali represents Prakriti, nature or matter, sometimes seen as having <b>a</b> <b>feminine</b> quality. The merging of these two qualities represent ultimate reality.|$|E

5|$|Cal also {{exhibits}} feminine characteristics, {{which allows}} Dr. Luce to classify her as possessing a female gender identity. In a home video taken when Cal was a child, his mother {{gives him a}} doll and he nurses it with a milk bottle. Luce carefully observes Callie's actions and diagnoses them as feminine, which causes him to determine that Callie has <b>a</b> <b>feminine</b> gender identity. Luce then concludes that gender identity is nurtured and etched into children at their young ages.|$|E

Some of their songs deal also with more serious matters, such as exploitation and abuse of women, murder, addiction, the destruction of the environment, social and political issues.|$|E

5|$|Zero {{was created}} by Taro Yoko, the game's {{director}} and co-writer, and designed by Kimihiko Fujisaka. Yoko wanted an unusual type of protagonist {{that had not been}} featured very often in games. Fujisaka crafted her to emulate the dark tones of the series, although he also added features to create <b>a</b> <b>feminine</b> vibe, such as the flower in her eye. Despite being criticized for her characterization and personality, she has also been praised for her interactions with the other characters and for standing out among video game protagonists. Fans of the Drakengard series in Japan have also received her positively.|$|E
5|$|Luka Urushibara is {{a friend}} of Okabe and Lab Member No. 006. His {{appearance}} is that of a female and he acts in <b>a</b> <b>feminine</b> way due to his upbringing, wearing girl's clothing within and outside his father's temple. He is also a close friend and classmate of Shiina, who often asks him to try on her cosplay costumes, but as he is quite shy, he generally refuses. He harbors homosexual feelings towards Okabe, who calls him by a nickname , and thinks of Luka as his pupil. He is 16 years old. While he does become a female for part of the story and in most of the time lines throughout the story, canonically he is male by the end, and in only one of multiple time lines Luka was female.|$|E
5|$|Shelley {{uses the}} {{historical}} novel {{to comment on}} gender relations; for example, Valperga is a feminist version of Scott's masculinist genre. Introducing women into the story who {{are not part of}} the historical record, Shelley uses their narratives to question established theological and political institutions. Shelley sets the male protagonist's compulsive greed for conquest in opposition to a female alternative: reason and sensibility. In Perkin Warbeck, Shelley's other historical novel, Lady Gordon stands for the values of friendship, domesticity, and equality. Through her, Shelley offers <b>a</b> <b>feminine</b> alternative to the masculine power politics that destroy the male characters. The novel provides a more inclusive historical narrative to challenge the one which usually relates only masculine events.|$|E

5|$|Different {{traditions and}} genres of poetry {{tend to use}} {{different}} meters, ranging from the Shakespearean iambic pentameter and the Homeric dactylic hexameter to the anapestic tetrameter used in many nursery rhymes. However, a number of variations to the established meter are common, both to provide emphasis or attention to a given foot or line and to avoid boring repetition. For example, the stress in a foot may be inverted, a caesura (or pause) may be added (sometimes {{in place of a}} foot or stress), or the final foot in a line may be given <b>a</b> <b>feminine</b> ending to soften it or be replaced by a spondee to emphasize it and create a hard stop. Some patterns (such as iambic pentameter) tend to be fairly regular, while other patterns, such as dactylic hexameter, tend to be highly irregular. Regularity can vary between language. In addition, different patterns often develop distinctively in different languages, so that, for example, iambic tetrameter in Russian will generally reflect a regularity in the use of accents to reinforce the meter, which does not occur, or occurs to a much lesser extent, in English.|$|E
5|$|In Egyptian mythology, the sun's {{emergence}} {{from the}} horizon each morning is likened to Ra's birth, {{an event that}} revitalizes him and {{the order of the}} cosmos. Ra emerges from the body of a goddess who represents the sky—usually Nut. Depictions of the rising sun often show Ra as a child contained within the solar disk. In this context, the Egyptologist Lana Troy suggests, the disk may represent the womb from which he is born or the placenta that emerges with him. The Eye of Ra can also {{take the form of a}} goddess, which according to Troy is both the mother who brings Ra forth from her womb and a sister who is born alongside him like a placenta. Ra was sometimes said to enter the body of the sky goddess at sunset, impregnating her and setting the stage for his rebirth at sunrise. Consequently, the Eye, as womb and mother of the child form of Ra, is also the consort of the adult Ra. The adult Ra, likewise, is the father of the Eye who is born at sunrise. The Eye is thus <b>a</b> <b>feminine</b> counterpart to Ra's masculine creative power, part of a broader Egyptian tendency to express creation and renewal through the metaphor of sexual reproduction. Ra gives rise to his daughter, the Eye, who in turn gives rise to him, her son, in a cycle of constant regeneration.|$|E
5|$|The Eye of Ra or Eye of Re is a {{being in}} ancient Egyptian mythology that {{functions}} as <b>a</b> <b>feminine</b> counterpart {{to the sun}} god Ra and a violent force that subdues his enemies. The Eye {{is an extension of}} Ra's power, equated with the disk of the sun, but it also behaves as an independent entity, which can be personified by a wide variety of Egyptian goddesses, including Hathor, Sekhmet, Bastet, Wadjet, and Mut. The Eye goddess acts as mother, sibling, consort, and daughter of the sun god. She is his partner in the creative cycle in which he begets the renewed form of himself that is born at dawn. The Eye's violent aspect defends Ra against the agents of disorder that threaten his rule. This dangerous aspect of the Eye goddess is often represented by a lioness or by the uraeus, or cobra, a symbol of protection and royal authority. The Eye of Ra is similar to the Eye of Horus, which belongs to a different god, Horus, but represents many of the same concepts. The disastrous effects when the Eye goddess rampages out of control and the efforts of the gods to return her to a benign state are a prominent motif in Egyptian mythology.|$|E

5|$|The more skin left {{unarmoured}} and exposed, {{the lower}} a gladiator's {{status and the}} greater his perceived effeminacy. Likewise, the engulfing net may {{have been seen as}} <b>a</b> <b>feminine</b> symbol. The light arms and armour of the retiarius thus established him as the lowliest, most disgraced, and most effeminate of the gladiator types. Helmets allowed both gladiators and spectators to dehumanise the fighters; when an arena combatant had to kill a comrade-at-arms, someone he probably lived and trained with every day, his opponent's helmet added an extra layer of separation. However, the retiarius was allowed no head protection; his face was visible to all. The emperor Claudius had all net-fighters who lost in combat put to death so that spectators could enjoy their expressions of agony. The retiariuss fighting style was another strike against him, as reliance on speed and evasion were viewed as undignified in comparison to the straightforward trading of blows. The retiarii lived in the worst barracks. Some members of the class trained to fight as Samnites, another gladiator type, in order to improve their status.|$|E
