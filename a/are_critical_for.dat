5|$|Chemolithotrophy {{is a type}} of {{metabolism}} {{found in}} prokaryotes where energy is obtained from the oxidation of inorganic compounds. These organisms can use hydrogen, reduced sulfur compounds (such as sulfide, hydrogen sulfide and thiosulfate), ferrous iron (FeII) or ammonia as sources of reducing power and they gain energy from the oxidation of these compounds with electron acceptors such as oxygen or nitrite. These microbial processes are important in global biogeochemical cycles such as acetogenesis, nitrification and denitrification and <b>are</b> <b>critical</b> <b>for</b> soil fertility.|$|E

It is an important concept in surface phase formation, epitaxial growth, heterogeneous catalysis, and other topics in surface science. As such, the principles of surface diffusion <b>are</b> <b>critical</b> <b>for</b> the chemical production and semiconductor industries. Real-world applications relying heavily on these phenomena include catalytic converters, integrated circuits used in electronic devices, and silver halide salts used in photographic film.|$|E

5|$|The two nucleic acids, DNA and RNA, are {{polymers}} of nucleotides. Each nucleotide {{is composed}} of a phosphate attached to a ribose or deoxyribose sugar group which {{is attached to a}} nitrogenous base. Nucleic acids <b>are</b> <b>critical</b> <b>for</b> the storage and use of genetic information, and its interpretation through the processes of transcription and protein biosynthesis. This information is protected by DNA repair mechanisms and propagated through DNA replication. Many viruses have an RNA genome, such as HIV, which uses reverse transcription to create a DNA template from its viral RNA genome. RNA in ribozymes such as spliceosomes and ribosomes is similar to enzymes as it can catalyze chemical reactions. Individual nucleosides are made by attaching a nucleobase to a ribose sugar. These bases are heterocyclic rings containing nitrogen, classified as purines or pyrimidines. Nucleotides also act as coenzymes in metabolic-group-transfer reactions.|$|E
5|$|Several {{experimental}} and clinical {{studies have indicated}} that aberrations and deregulations of the UPS contribute to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative and myodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Pick's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, and motor neuron diseases, polyglutamine (PolyQ) diseases, Muscular dystrophies and several rare forms of neurodegenerative diseases associated with dementia. As part of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS), the proteasome maintains cardiac protein homeostasis and thus plays a significant role in cardiac Ischemic injury, ventricular hypertrophy and Heart failure. Additionally, evidence is accumulating that the UPS plays an essential role in malignant transformation. UPS proteolysis {{plays a major role in}} responses of cancer cells to stimulatory signals that <b>are</b> <b>critical</b> <b>for</b> the development of cancer. Accordingly, gene expression by degradation of transcription factors, such as p53, c-Jun, c-Fos, NF-κB, c-Myc, HIF-1α, MATα2, STAT3, sterol-regulated element-binding proteins and androgen receptors are all controlled by the UPS and thus involved in the development of various malignancies. Moreover, the UPS regulates the degradation of tumor suppressor gene products such as adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) in colorectal cancer, retinoblastoma (Rb). and von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL), as well as a number of proto-oncogenes (Raf, Myc, Myb, Rel, Src, Mos, Abl). The UPS is also involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses. This activity is usually attributed to the role of proteasomes in the activation of NF-κB which further regulates the expression of pro inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-β, IL-8, adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, P selectine) and prostaglandins and nitric oxide (NO). Additionally, the UPS also plays a role in inflammatory responses as regulators of leukocyte proliferation, mainly through proteolysis of cyclines and the degradation of CDK inhibitors. Lastly, autoimmune disease patients with SLE, Sjogren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) predominantly exhibit circulating proteasomes which can be applied as clinical biomarkers.|$|E

25|$|Mutations in proto-oncogenes can {{modify their}} {{expression}} and function, {{increasing the amount}} or activity of the product protein.

Insulin is needed to keep blood sugar levels within optimal ranges, and its lack can lead to high blood sugar. As an untreated chronic condition, diabetic neuropathy can result. Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age but is most often diagnosed before adulthood. For people living with type 1 diabetes, insulin injections <b>are</b> <b>critical</b> <b>for</b> survival.|$|E
25|$|Mutations in proto-oncogenes, {{which are}} the {{normally}} quiescent counterparts of oncogenes, can modify their expression and function, increasing the amount or activity of the product protein.

The chance of cancer cannot be reduced by removing proto-oncogenes from the genome, even if this were possible, as they <b>are</b> <b>critical</b> <b>for</b> growth, repair and homeostasis of the organism.

25|$|From a {{biological}} standpoint, water has many distinct properties that <b>are</b> <b>critical</b> <b>for</b> {{the proliferation of}} life. It carries out this role by allowing organic compounds to react in ways that ultimately allow replication. All known forms of life depend on water. Water is vital both as a solvent in which many of the body's solutes dissolve and as {{an essential part of}} many metabolic processes within the body. Metabolism is the sum total of anabolism and catabolism. In anabolism, water is removed from molecules (through energy requiring enzymatic chemical reactions) in order to grow larger molecules (e.g. starches, triglycerides and proteins for storage of fuels and information). In catabolism, water is used to break bonds in order to generate smaller molecules (e.g. glucose, fatty acids and amino acids to be used for fuels for energy use or other purposes). Without water, these particular metabolic processes could not exist.|$|E
25|$|The rodent AFP {{system can}} be {{overridden}} with massive injections of estrogen, which overwhelm the AFP system and will masculinize the fetus. The masculinizing effect of estrogens may seem counter-intuitive since estrogens <b>are</b> <b>critical</b> <b>for</b> the proper development of female secondary characteristics during puberty. However, {{this is not the}} case prenatally. Gonadal hormones from the testes, such as testosterone and antimullerian hormone are required to cause development of a phenotypic male. Without these hormones the fetus will develop into a phenotypic female even if genetically XY. Interestingly, the conversion of testosterone into estradiol by aromatase in many tissues may be an important step in masculinization of that tissue. Masculinization of the brain is thought to occur both by conversion of testosterone into estradiol by aromatase, but also by de novo synthesis of estrogens within the brain. Thus, AFP may protect the fetus from maternal estradiol that would otherwise have a masculinizing effect on the fetus, but its exact role is still controversial.|$|E
25|$|Several {{different}} cell {{types are}} critical to tumor growth. In particular, endothelial progenitor cells {{have been shown to}} have a strong influence on the growth of tumor blood-vessels. This finding was published in the journals Science (2008) and Genes and Development (2007) together with the fact that endothelial progenitor cells <b>are</b> <b>critical</b> <b>for</b> metastasis and angiogenesis. A publication in Cancer Research (August 2010) confirmed the importance of endothelial progenitor cells in tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis. This seminal paper demonstrated that endothelial progenitor cells can be marked using the Inhibitor of DNA Binding 1 (ID1). This novel finding meant that investigators gained the ability to track endothelial progenitor cells from the bone marrow to the blood to the tumor-stroma and even incorporated in tumor vasculature. This finding of endothelial progenitor cells incorporated in tumor vasculature proves the importance of this cell type in blood-vessel development in a tumor setting and metastasis. Furthermore, ablation of the endothelial progenitor cells in the bone marrow can lead to a significant decrease in tumor growth and vasculature development. Therefore, endothelial progenitor cells are very important in tumor biology and present novel therapeutic targets.|$|E
