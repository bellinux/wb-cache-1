25|$|When the Millennium Line was built, TransLink ordered new-generation Mark II ART trains from Bombardier Transportation, some {{of which}} were {{assembled}} in a Burnaby factory. Similar trains are used in Kuala Lumpur's Kelana Jaya Line, New York's JFK AirTrain, and the new Beijing Airport Express. These trains are run in four-car configurations on the Expo Line, and two-car configurations on the Millennium Line. Each pair of cars is semi-permanently joined together in a twin unit or 'married pair', with a length of 33.4 m. Mark II trains have a streamlined front and rear, an <b>articulated</b> <b>joint</b> allowing passengers to walk the length of a married pair, white/grey/blue interior, and six doors per car, three per side. TransLink also ordered 48 Mark II ART (2009/2010 model) in 2009 to further supplement supply and integrate new features like CCTV and visual maps with LED lights.|$|E

40|$|In-mold {{assembly}} {{can be used}} {{to create}} plastic products with <b>articulated</b> <b>joints.</b> This process eliminates the need for post-molding assembly and reduces the number of parts being used in the product, hence improving the product quality. However, designing both products and molds is significantly more challenging in case of in-mold assembly. Currently, a systematic methodology does not exist for developing product and processes to exploit potential benefits of in-mold assembly for creating <b>articulated</b> <b>joints.</b> This paper is a step towards creating such a methodology and reports the following three results. First, it presents a model for designing assemblies and molding process so that the joint clearances and variation in the joint clearances can meet the performance goals. Second, it describes proven mold design templates for realizing revolute, prismatic, and spherical joints. Third, it describes a mold design methodology for designing molds for products that contain <b>articulated</b> <b>joints</b> and will be produced using in-mold assembly process. Three case studies are also presented to illustrate how in-mold assembly process {{can be used to}} create articulated devices...|$|R

5000|$|As {{like the}} other SkyTrain lines, {{ridership}} on the Canada Line {{is expected to increase}} in the future, and eventually capacity will need to be upgraded. The capacity of the line can be increased by 50 per cent through an increase in frequency by adding more trains and another 50 per cent through lengthening trains to a three-car configuration. Unlike Bombardier ART trains, the Hyundai Rotem trains will not be operated as longer four- or six-car trains. Through inserting a middle [...] "C" [...] car at the <b>articulated</b> <b>joint</b> between two end cars, available capacity will be similar to a four-car Mark II or a six-car Mark I train. The Canada Line's station platforms are expandable to 50 m in length to accommodate these future three-car trains; the five busiest stations are already 50 m in length. The Canada Line has a designed future capacity of 15,000 pphpd when operating three-car trains at 2-minute headways.|$|E

50|$|By {{means of}} a cable running along the tow rope the pilots of the tow-plane and of the freight glider were able to {{communicate}} with each other which made blind flying possible, when necessary. The towing speed of the DFS-230 was approximately 116 mph. It dropped its landing gear as soon as it was safely in the air, and landed by {{means of a}} landing skid. The DFS-230 could be towed by a Ju-52 (which could tow two with difficulty), a He-111, a Ju-87, Hs 126, a Bf 110, or a Bf 109. The Ju 52 towed the glider using a 131 ft cable or, in bad weather, a much shorter rigid bar connected by an <b>articulated</b> <b>joint</b> to the tow aircraft. The DFS-230 had the highest glide ratio (18) of any World War 2 military glider other than the Antonov A-7. This was because it was thought that the glider had to be capable of a long approach during landing, so that it could be released a considerable distance from the target so the sound of the towing aircraft did not alert the enemy.|$|E
50|$|A rod end bearing, {{also known}} as a heim joint (N. America) or rose joint (U.K. and elsewhere), is a {{mechanical}} <b>articulating</b> <b>joint.</b> Such joints are used on the ends of control rods, steering links, tie rods, or anywhere a precision <b>articulating</b> <b>joint</b> is required, and where a clevis end (which requires perfect 90 degree alignment between the attached shaft and the second component) is unsuitable. A ball swivel with an opening through which a bolt or other attaching hardware may pass is pressed into a circular casing with a threaded shaft attached. The threaded portion may be either male or female. The heim joint's advantage is that the ball insert permits the rod or bolt passing through it to be misaligned to a limited degree (an angle other than 90 degrees). A link terminated in two heim joints permits misalignment of their attached shafts (viz., other than 180 degrees) when used in tension. When used in compression, the through-rods are forced to the extreme ends of their ball's misalignment range, which cocks the link at an oblique angle.|$|R
40|$|AbstractDynamic {{simulation}} of mechanical behavior and {{response of the}} total human body to external forces provide essential input for the injury prediction criteria and subsequent design and development of crash protection systems. The most sophisticated versions of the total-human-body models are articulated and multisegmented to simulate all the major <b>articulating</b> <b>joints</b> and segments of the human body. Effectiveness of the multisegmented models to predict accurately live human response depends heavily on the proper biomechanical description and {{simulation of}} the <b>articulating</b> <b>joints.</b> This paper is concerned with a mathematical modelling of an <b>articulating</b> <b>joint</b> defined by contact surfaces of two body segments which execute a relative dynamic motion within the constraints of ligament forces. Mathematical equations for the joint model are {{in the form of}} second-order nonlinear differential equations coupled with nonlinear algebraic constraint conditions. Differential equations of motion are reduced to a set of nonlinear simultaneous algebraic equations by applying the Newmark method of differential approximation. By subsequent application of Newton—Raphson iteration process the same equations are converted to a set of simultaneous linear algebraic equations. Iteration process is continued until a solution vector of unknowns satisfying a prescribed convergence criterion is obtained. The two-dimensional version of the mathematical joint model is applied to human knee joint for several dynamic loading conditions on tibia. Results for the ligament and contact forces, contact point locations between femur and tibia and the corresponding dynamic orientation of tibia with respect to femur are obtained...|$|R
40|$|Motion {{control is}} one of the {{important}} components of animation. The process of creating motion of an animated character usually involves articulated model as shown in Figure 5. 1. Character animation can be described as the movement of multiple <b>articulated</b> <b>joints</b> hierarchically. All the <b>articulated</b> <b>joints</b> are connected by segments in a hierarchical form. Then, it is combined with a 3 D geometric model such as polygonal mesh. The trajectories or orientations of the joints are specified in the skeleton. The change of a root joint propagates to other sub-joints. For example, a rotation of hip joint made the entire leg to rotate (Jing 2005). There are four main techniques for creating 3 D character animation: keyframing, kinematics, dynamics and motion capture. In keyframing animation, the key values for the animated DOFs are specified by animator while the computer interpolates between these values. Motion capture is the process that is used to record the movements of the objects and to map the movements to a virtual character. These three techniques will be discussed in this chapter...|$|R
