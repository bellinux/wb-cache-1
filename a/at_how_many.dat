Christina Lee of website Idolator wrote {{that there are two}} songs on the album which show [...] "how ubiquitous she's [...] become", [...] "Love Without Tragedy / Mother Mary" [...] and [...] "Half of Me". A reviewer for Billboard was surprised <b>at</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> [...] "heartfelt ballads" [...] are included on the album, and listed [...] "Half of Me" [...] as one of the examples. Michael Gallucci for PopCrush wrote that [...] "Half of Me", along with [...] "Pour It Up", are songs for the [...] "haters". He further wrote that the singer pushes the track as she has an [...] "agenda", but criticised the use of [...] "fuck", which he points out as being used in the majority of Unapologetics tracks. Upon the release of Unapologetic, [...] "Half of Me" [...] charted in several territories due to strong digital downloads. It debuted on the Irish Singles Chart at number 84 on November 22, 2012. On November 25, 2012, the song entered the UK Singles Chart at number 75, and the UK R Chart at number ten. In Switzerland, the song debuted at number 46.

60|$|If {{the world}} {{continues}} {{to read the}} Reflections, and reads it with a new admiration that is not diminished {{by the fact that}} on the special issue its tendency is every day more clearly discerned to have been misleading, we may be sure that it is not for the sake of such things as the precise character of the Revolution of 1688, where, for that matter, constitutional writers have shown abundantly that Burke was nearly as much in the wrong as Dr. Sacheverell. Nor has the book lived merely by its gorgeous rhetoric and high emotions, though these have been contributing elements. It lives because it contains a sentiment, a method, a set of informal principles, which, awakened into new life after the Revolution, rapidly transformed the current ways of thinking and feeling about all the most serious objects of our attention, and have powerfully helped to give a richer substance to all modern literature. In the Reflections we have the first great sign that the ideas on government and philosophy which Locke had been the chief agent in setting into European circulation, and which had carried all triumphantly before them throughout the century, did not comprehend the whole truth nor the deepest truth about human character--the relations of men and the union of men in society. It has often been said that the armoury from which the French philosophers of the eighteenth century borrowed their weapons was furnished from England, and it may be added as truly that the reaction against that whole scheme of thought came from England. In one sense we may call the Reflections a political pamphlet, but it is much more than this, just as the movement against which it was levelled was much more than a political movement. The Revolution rested on a philosophy, and Burke confronted it with an antagonistic philosophy. Those are but superficial readers who fail to see <b>at</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> points Burke, while seeming only to deal with the French monarchy and the British constitution, with Dr. Price and Marie Antoinette, was in fact, and exactly because he dealt with them in the comprehensive spirit of true philosophy, turning men's minds to an attitude from which not only the political incidents of the hour, but the current ideas about religion, psychology, the very nature of human knowledge, would all be seen in a changed light and clothed in new colour. All really profound speculation about society comes in time to touch the heart of every other object of speculation, not by directly contributing new truths or directly corroborating old ones, but by setting men to consider the consequences to life of different opinions on these abstract subjects, and their relations to the great paramount interests of society, however those interests may happen at the time to be conceived. Burke's book marks a turning-point in literary history, because it was the signal for that reaction over the whole field of thought, into which the Revolution drove many of the finest minds of the next generation, by showing the supposed consequences of pure individualistic rationalism.|$|E
