The processes for product development and manufacturing {{have been developed}} to meet the tighter specifications and quality requirements. The development of test methods and measurement devices have not been as fast, and as a con-sequence, the relative impact of measurement errors has increased. Traditionally, the measurement inaccuracies have been compensated by tightening the <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits.</b> This study concentrates on analysing, through simulation, how compa-nies should minimise the failure costs by adjusting <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits.</b> The study shows, in contrast to the conventional thinking, that widening the <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits</b> makes business sense in some cases...|$|E

40|$|In {{industry}} and in laboratories, {{it is crucial}} to continuously control the validity of the analytical methods used to follow the products' quality characteristics. Validity must be assessed at two levels. The 'pre-study' validation aims at demonstrating be re use that the method will be able to achieve its objectives. The 'in-study' validation is intended to verify, by inserting quality control (QC) samples in routine runs, that the method remains valid over time. At these two levels, the analytical method will be claimed valid if it is possible to prove that a sufficient proportion of analytical results is expected to lie within given <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits</b> [-lambda, lambda] around the nominal value. This paper presents and compares four approaches to checking the validity of a measurement method at the pre-study level. They can be classified into two categories. In the first, a lower confidence bound for the estimated probability pi of a result lying within the <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits</b> is computed and compared with a given acceptance level. Maximum likelihood and delta methods are used to estimate the quality level pi and the corresponding estimator variance. Two approaches are then proposed to derive the confidence bound: the asymptotic maximum likelihood approach and a method proposed by Mee (Commun. Stat. Theory Methods 1988; 17 (5) : 1465 - 1479). The second category of approaches checks whether a tolerance interval for hypothetical future measurements ties within the predefined <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits</b> [-lambda, lambda]. beta-expectation and beta-gamma-content tolerance intervals are investigated and compared in this context. These four approaches are illustrated on a bioanalytical HPLC-UV analytical process and compared through simulations. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} a rapid and sensitive RP-HPLC method with UV detection, using the diclofenac sodium release determination in solid pharmaceutical formulations.

The validation phase was completed by investigating of the risk profiles of various acceptable regression models in order to avoid obtaining measurements outside the <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits</b> fixed a priori. On the other hand, the present study shows how the LC method can be used more accurately to assess the kinetic dissolution profiles, instead the UV-visible method required by monographs of the USP.

40|$|An {{analytical}} {{transfer is}} a complete process that consists in transferring a validated analytical method from a sending laboratory (called sender) to a receiving laboratory (called receiver) after having experimentally demonstrated that it also masters the method. The decision to transfer an analytical method is usually taken based on the combination of two criteria: one about systematic error and one about random errors. These usual criteria, their combination and their limitations are described in this paper. As it is for method validation, total error-based approaches should be also considered in method transfer. Two approaches are proposed {{in order to have}} a total error-based criterion and to take into account the precision of the true value estimate. In the first approach, a beta-expectation tolerance interval similar to the one used in method validation is calculated and then compared to <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits</b> around the estimate of the true value. The second approach, found as slightly more powerful than the first one, consists in estimating the probability to have a result outside these <b>acceptance</b> <b>limits.</b> (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

Materials and Methods: The study population consisted of sausages produced in Qazvin province from 2011 to 2014.
