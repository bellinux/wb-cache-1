Despite being the most widespread mammal in the world, only one species is currently recognized. Oceanic Science journals have long hinted at {{the existence of a}} complex breed of miniature killer whales since the 1950's. The dwarf killer whale is a type of killer whale found in Antarctic waters believed by some scientists to be a distinct species from the larger killer whales found throughout the world's oceans. Since Soviet researchers proposed new species in the 1980's, the differences in killer whales have been studied more closely in order to gain more credible knowledge on possible subspecies of the killer whale. There are several ecotypes that have been established in regards to the whales physical appearances and body length by Pitman and colleagues. A recent study proposed by Pitman et al.

The {{objective of this}} research was to compare the three types of point clouds to determine whether image point clouds could compete with the accuracy of LiDAR point clouds. The two main types of image point clouds are those created photogrammetrically, with two side-by-side images, or through feature matching between multiple images using multiview stereo techniques. Two software packages known for handling <b>aerial</b> imagery, IMAGINE <b>Photogrammetry</b> and Agisoft Photoscan Pro, were used to create such models.

There are some problems in constructing 3 D city model by using <b>aerial</b> <b>photogrammetry</b> including the difficulties in recognition of small buildings and levels of details of building geometry is limited.

In order to improve <b>aerial</b> <b>photogrammetry</b> data for 3 D city model development, this research was conducted by integrating <b>aerial</b> <b>photogrammetry</b> data with close-range photogrammetry data.

The base model was developed from <b>aerial</b> <b>photogrammetry</b> data and consists of Digital Terrain Model. The building models were generated from aerial and close-range photogrammetry data. <b>Aerial</b> <b>photogrammetry</b> was used to generate the whole buildings in the study area, while close-range photogrammetry was used to develop the small building that is difficult to recognize and new building that is not recorded in aerial image. The buildings from aerial and close-range photogrammetry were integrated with the base model to form 3 D city model. At the end of this study, the 3 D city model was presented in 3 D visualization.

In conclusion, the building models from close-range photogrammetry have achieved levels of details of level three where building geometry consists of architectural elements such as windows and doors. The accuracy of the building models from close-range photogrammetry is less than one centimeter when compared with measurement from total station Leica TCR 307.

Several techniques, including GPS kinematic, digital <b>aerial</b> and terrestrial <b>photogrammetry,</b> airborne and terrestrial laser scanning and optical satellite imagery systems, are suitable surveying methods that provide appropriate spatial resolutions. Among these techniques, the terrestrial laser scanning, measures range and reflectance of surfaces with redundant survey points (illuminated elements) and is capable to capture topographic details within a few centimetres accuracy.

The laser image alignment process, based on ICP algorithms, enabled the registration of different scans characterized by a few centimeters resolution at sub-centimeter level, providing an accurate mosaic reconstruction. A final triangulated model was generated with a mean size of 5 cm, providing an high definition geometrical, geological and geo-morphological information of the surface.
