5|$|Heathenry {{does not}} have a unified {{theology}} and is typically polytheistic, centering on a pantheon of deities from pre-Christian Germanic Europe. It adopts cosmological views from these religions, including an animistic view of the cosmos in which the natural world is imbued with spirits. The faith's deities and these spirits are honored in sacrificial rites known as blóts in which food and libations are offered to them. These are often accompanied by symbel, the act of ceremonially toasting the gods with an alcoholic beverage. Some practitioners also engage in rituals designed to induce an <b>altered</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> and visions, most notably seiðr and galdr, with the intent of gaining wisdom and advice from the deities. Although many solitary practitioners follow the religion by themselves, members of the Heathen community often assemble in small groups, usually known as kindreds or hearths, to perform their rites outdoors or in specially constructed buildings. Heathen ethical systems emphasize honor, personal integrity, and loyalty, while beliefs about an afterlife vary and are rarely emphasized.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Ashley {{plays on}} the beach and builds sand castles. When Ashley's drunken mother phones, {{demanding}} to know where her son is, Uncle David feigns ignorance, telling her that he himself is not in Sheppey but in Manchester. Taking Ashley to an abandoned military bunker, he injects an unknown substance into his nephew's vein as they kiss. Ashley enters an <b>altered</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness,</b> and David guides him back to the caravan as they smoke marijuana. Once there, David gives Ashley a second injection, as they sit and look out at the shore. After dark, David places his near-catatonic nephew in a dog bed, showing him a copy of a picture book titled Is Britain Great?. He proceeds to give him a third and final injection, which he remarks will make Ashley lose consciousness and suffer organ failure. As Ashley dies, David professes that he has never loved anyone else as much before. The next morning, he goes onto the beach to place his nephew's body in a shallow grave, tearfully kissing the body goodbye before it is swept away by the sea.|$|E

40|$|This {{theoretical}} study {{contains a}} systematic analysis <b>of</b> <b>altered</b> <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> The study {{is based on a}} reflection <b>of</b> the qualitative <b>altered</b> <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness,</b> that offers some potential and attempts to describe <b>altered</b> <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> in their complexity as well as to map all their aspects in a structured. It utilises the notion <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> to define the <b>altered</b> <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> The chosen method is to work with literary sources where an emphasis is placed on an interdisciplinary approach. The structure of the thesis is divided into three chapters. The key topic of the first chapter is an examination of the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> and interdisciplinary theories <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> The second chapter is focused on the description and analysis <b>of</b> <b>altered</b> <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness,</b> concentrates on the history and methods <b>of</b> research <b>of</b> <b>altered</b> <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> and delineates their basic characteristic and their functions. The last chapter divides the <b>altered</b> <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> into categories and gives them a detailed description. The thesis ends with a final conclusion which brings an integration of the findings above mentioned with the focused on the second chapter.

25|$|In 1995 Adolf Dittrich and Daniel Lamparter {{did a study}} {{where they}} found that DMT-induced <b>altered</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> (ASC) is {{strongly}} influenced by habitual, rather than situative factors. In the study researchers used three dimensions of the APZ questionnaire to describe ASC (rating scales of ASC). First, oceanic boundlessness (OB) refers to dissolution of ego boundaries mostly associated with positive emotions. Second, anxious ego-dissolution (AED) includes disorder of thoughts, loss of autonomy and self-control and third, visionary restructuralization (VR) that includes auditory and visual illusions, hallucinations. Results showed strong effects within first and third dimensions for all conditions, especially DMT and suggested strong intrastability of elicited reactions independently of the condition for the OB and VR scales. Importantly, the experiment was conducted in a safe laboratory environment. This particular setting had a certain influence on found results that might be very different outside the laboratory environment.|$|E

500|$|In {{susceptible}} individuals, midazolam {{has been}} known to cause a paradoxical reaction, a well-documented complication with benzodiazepines. When this occurs, the individual may experience anxiety, involuntary movements, aggressive or violent behavior, uncontrollable crying or verbalization, and other similar effects. This seems {{to be related to the}} <b>altered</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> or disinhibition produced by the drug. Paradoxical behavior is often not recalled by the patient due to the amnesia-producing properties of the drug. In extreme situations, flumazenil can be administered to inhibit or reverse the effects of midazolam. [...] Antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol, have also been used for this purpose.|$|E
500|$|Later in the book, Duerr {{looks at}} ethnographic {{examples}} of shamanism, {{focusing on the}} shamanic use of hallucinogens and the experiences which such entheogens induce. He argues that [...] "archaic cultures" [...] recognize that a human can only truly understand themselves if {{they go to the}} mental boundary between [...] "civilization" [...] and [...] "wilderness", and that it is this <b>altered</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> which both the shaman and the European witch reached in their visionary journeys. Believing that the modern western worldview failed to understand this process, Duerr criticizes the work of those anthropologists and scientists who had tried to understand [...] "archaic" [...] society through a western rationalist framework, instead advocating a return to [...] "archaic" [...] modes of thought.|$|E
500|$|One {{religious}} practice sometimes found in Heathenry is seiðr, {{which has been}} described as [...] "a particular shamanic trance ritual complex", although the appropriateness of using [...] "shamanism" [...] to describe seiðr is debatable. Contemporary seiðr developed during the 1990s out of the wider Neo-Shamanic movement, with some practitioners studying the use of trance-states in other faiths, such as Umbanda, first. A prominent form is high-seat or oracular seiðr, which is based on the account of Guðriðr in Eiríks saga. Although such practices differ between groups, oracular seiðr typically involves a seiðr-worker sitting on a high seat while songs and chants are performed to invoke gods and wights. Drumming is then performed to induce an <b>altered</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> in the practitioner, who goes on a meditative journey in which they visualise travelling through the world tree to the realm of Hel. The assembled audience then provide questions for the seiðr-worker, with the latter offering replies based on information obtained in their trance-state. Some seiðr-practitioners make use of entheogenic substances as part of this practice, although others explicitly oppose the use of any such mind-altering drugs.|$|E

50|$|Transpersonal {{anthropology}} {{studies the}} relationship between <b>altered</b> <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> and culture. As with transpersonal psychology, the field is much concerned with <b>altered</b> <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> (ASC) and transpersonal experience. However, the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross-cultural issues—for instance, the roles of myth, ritual, diet, and texts in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences.|$|R
500|$|The ONA {{believe that}} humans {{live within the}} causal realm, which obeys the laws of cause and effect. However, they also believe in an acausal realm, in which {{the laws of physics}} do not apply, further {{promoting}} the idea that numinous energies from the acausal realm can be drawn into the causal, allowing for the performance of magic. Believing in the existence of magic [...] which the group spell [...] "magick" [...] following the example of Elias Ashmole's 1652 work Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum [...] the ONA distinguish between external, internal, and aeonic magick. External magic itself is divided into two categories: ceremonial magick, which is performed by more than two people to achieve a specific goal, and hermetic magick, which is performed either solitarily or in a pair and which is often sexual in nature. Internal magick is designed to produce an <b>altered</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> in the participant, in order to result in a process of [...] "individuation" [...] which bestows adepthood. The most advanced form of magick in the ONA system is aeonic magick, the practice of which is restricted to those who are already perceived to have mastered external and internal magick and attained the grade of master. The purpose of aeonic magick is to influence large numbers of people over a lengthy period of time, thus affecting the development of future aeons. In particular it is employed with the intent of disrupting the current socio-political system of the Western world, which the ONA believe has been corrupted by Judeo-Christian religion.|$|E

These traditions include practices to induce religious or mystical experiences, but also ethical standards and practices to enhance self-control and integrate the mystical experience into daily life.|$|E

The drumming sessions of the women's Zār sect are a prominent part of Dervish music. [...] The Sufi orders engage in ritualized dhikr ceremonies.

2500|$|Mysticism {{involves}} an explanatory context, which provides meaning for so-called mystical and visionary experiences, and related experiences like trances. According to Dan Merkur, mysticism {{may relate to}} any kind of ecstasy or <b>altered</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness,</b> and the ideas and explanations related to them. Parsons stresses the importance of distinguishing between temporary experiences and mysticism as a process, which is embodied within a [...] "religious matrix" [...] of texts and practices. Richard Jones does the same. Peter Moore notes that mystical experience may also happen in a spontaneous and natural way, to people who are not committed to any religious tradition. These experiences are not necessarily interpreted in a religious framework. Ann Taves asks by which processes experiences are set apart and deemed religious or mystical.|$|E
2500|$|In {{her study}} of the Pagan {{movement}} in the U.S., journalist Margot Adler noted that the Faeries placed a great emphasis on the [...] "transformative power of play", believing that playful behavior had a role within ritual {{that could lead to}} an <b>altered</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> In keeping with this, they were often the [...] "public anarchists" [...] at Pagan events, challenging the formalized ritual structures propagated by other Pagans; at one event in the 1980s, a group of Faeries stood {{at the entrance to the}} ritual circle, calling out [...] "Attention! No spontaneity! We're the spontaneity police!" [...] as a way of parodying what they saw as formalised trends within Pagan ritual. Adler also noted similar trends within other Pagan groups, such as the Reformed Druids of North America and the Erisian movement.|$|E

2500|$|One {{explanation}} for the SRA allegations {{is that they were}} based upon false memories caused by the over-use of hypnosis and other suggestive techniques by therapists underestimating the suggestibility of their clients. The <b>altered</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> induced by hypnosis rendered patients an unusual ability to produce confabulations, often with the assistance of their therapists. Advocates of false memory syndrome (FMS), a controversial term promoted by the False Memory Syndrome Foundation, claim that the purported [...] "memories" [...] of ritual abuse are actually false memories, created iatrogenically through suggestion or coercion. The FMSF has used the idea of ritual abuse as a strategy to illustrate their position that most allegations of sexual abuse uncovered by the suggestive techniques used during recovered memory therapy are false [...] "memories" [...] of events that never happened. According to Kathleen Faller this has contributed to the sensationalization of the ritual abuse cases in the media.|$|E
2500|$|According to Yale University music {{professor}} Willie Ruff, {{the singing}} of psalms in Gaelic by Presbyterians of the Scottish Hebrides evolved from [...] "lining out" [...] – where one person sang a solo and others followed – into the call and response of gospel music of the American South. Coming out of the African-American religious experience, American gospel music {{can be traced to}} the early 17th century. Gospel music has roots in the black oral tradition, and typically utilizes a great deal of repetition, which allows those who could not read the opportunity to participate in worship. During this time, hymns and sacred songs were lined and repeated in a call and response fashion, and Negro spirituals and work songs emerged. Repetition and [...] "call and response" [...] are accepted elements in African music, designed to achieve an <b>altered</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> we sometimes refer to as [...] "trance", and strengthen communal bonds.|$|E

She and two close friends had consumed 100mg of MDMA and reported positive emotional experiences. Following the self-trials of a colleague at the University of San Francisco, Shulgin synthesized MDMA and tried it himself in September and October 1976. Shulgin first reported on MDMA in a presentation at a conference in Bethesda, Maryland in December 1976. In 1978, he and David E. Nichols published a report on the drug's psychoactive effect in humans. They described MDMA as inducing [...] "an easily controlled <b>altered</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> with emotional and sensual overtones" [...] comparable [...] "to marijuana, to psilocybin devoid of the hallucinatory component, or to low levels of MDA".|$|E
