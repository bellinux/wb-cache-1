5|$|Most of the {{chemistry}} of <b>antimony</b> is characteristic of a nonmetal. <b>Antimony</b> has some definite cationic chemistry, SbO+ and Sb(OH)2+ being present in acidic aqueous solution; the compound Sb8(GaCl4)2, which contains the homopolycation, Sb82+, was prepared in 2004. It can form alloys {{with one or more}} metals such as aluminium, iron, nickel, copper, zinc, tin, lead and bismuth. <b>Antimony</b> has fewer tendencies to anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals. Its solution chemistry is characterised by the formation of oxyanions. Like arsenic, <b>antimony</b> generally forms compounds in which it has an oxidation state of +3 or +5. The halides, and the oxides and their derivatives are illustrative examples. The +5 state is less stable than the +3, but relatively easier to attain than with arsenic. This is explained by the poor shielding afforded the arsenic nucleus by its 3d10 electrons. In comparison, the tendency of <b>antimony</b> (being a heavier atom) to oxidize more easily partially offsets the effect of its 4d10 shell. Tripositive <b>antimony</b> is amphoteric; pentapositive <b>antimony</b> is (predominately) acidic. Consistent with an increase in metallic character down group 15, <b>antimony</b> forms salts or salt-like compounds including a nitrate Sb(NO3)3, phosphate SbPO4, sulfate Sb2(SO4)3 and perchlorate Sb(ClO4)3. The otherwise acidic pentoxide Sb2O5 shows some basic (metallic) behaviour in that it can be dissolved in very acidic solutions, with the formation of the oxycation SbO. The oxide Sb2O3 is polymeric, amphoteric, and a glass former. <b>Antimony</b> has an extensive organometallic chemistry (see organoantimony chemistry).|$|E
5|$|Arsenic and <b>antimony</b> are not {{semiconductors}} {{in their}} standard states. Both form type III-V semiconductors (such as GaAs, AlSb or GaInAsSb) {{in which the}} average number of valence electrons per atom is {{the same as that of}} Group 14 elements. These compounds are preferred for some special applications. <b>Antimony</b> nanocrystals may enable lithium-ion batteries to be replaced by more powerful sodium ion batteries.|$|E
5|$|Arsenic {{compounds}} such as {{sodium arsenite}} or sodium arsenate are effective flame retardants for wood {{but have been}} less frequently used due to their toxicity. <b>Antimony</b> trioxide is a flame retardant. Aluminium hydroxide {{has been used as}} a wood-fibre, rubber, plastic and textile flame retardant since the 1890s. Apart from aluminium hydroxide, use of phosphorus based flame-retardants—in the form of, for example, organophosphates—now exceeds that of any of the other main retardant types. These employ boron, <b>antimony</b> or halogenated hydrocarbon compounds.|$|E
5|$|Boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, <b>antimony,</b> and {{tellurium}} are recognised commonly as metalloids. Depending on the author, one or {{more from}} selenium, polonium, or astatine are sometimes added to the list. Boron sometimes is excluded, by itself, or with silicon. Sometimes tellurium is not regarded as a metalloid. The inclusion of <b>antimony,</b> polonium, and astatine as metalloids also has been questioned.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of <b>antimony</b> ore in the Kuching region led Pangeran Indera Mahkota, {{a representative of}} the Sultan of Brunei, to increase development in the territory between 1824 and 1830. Increasing <b>antimony</b> production in the region led the Brunei Sultanate to demand higher taxes, which ultimately led to civil unrest. In 1839, Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin II (1827–1852) assigned his uncle Pangeran Muda Hashim the task of restoring order but his inability to do so caused him to request the aid of British sailor James Brooke. Brooke's success in quelling the revolt was rewarded with <b>antimony,</b> property and the governorship of Sarawak, which at that time consisted only of a small area centred on Kuching.|$|E
5|$|The heavier {{metalloids}} {{continue the}} theme. Arsenic can form alloys with metals, including platinum and copper; {{it is also}} added to copper and its alloys to improve corrosion resistance and appears to confer the same benefit when added to magnesium. <b>Antimony</b> is well known as an alloy-former, including with the coinage metals. Its alloys include pewter (a tin alloy with up to 20% <b>antimony)</b> and type metal (a lead alloy with up to 25% <b>antimony).</b> Tellurium readily alloys with iron, as ferrotellurium (50–58% tellurium), and with copper, {{in the form of}} copper tellurium (40–50% tellurium). Ferrotellurium is used as a stabilizer for carbon in steel casting. Of the non-metallic elements less often recognised as metalloids, selenium—in the form of ferroselenium (50–58% selenium)—is used to improve the machinability of stainless steels.|$|E
5|$|Two <b>antimony</b> compounds, {{sodium stibogluconate}} and stibophen, {{are used as}} antiparasitical drugs.|$|E

5|$|Bismuth forms {{trivalent}} and pentavalent compounds, the trivalent ones {{being more}} common. Many of its chemical properties {{are similar to}} those of arsenic and <b>antimony,</b> although they are less toxic than derivatives of those lighter elements.|$|E
5|$|Boron trifluoride is planar and {{possesses}} {{an incomplete}} octet. It {{functions as a}} Lewis acid and combines with Lewis bases like ammonia to form adducts. Carbon tetrafluoride is tetrahedral and inert; its group analogues, silicon and germanium tetrafluoride, are also tetrahedral but behave as Lewis acids. The pnictogens form trifluorides that increase in reactivity and basicity with higher molecular weight, although nitrogen trifluoride resists hydrolysis and is not basic. The pentafluorides of phosphorus, arsenic, and <b>antimony</b> are more reactive than their respective trifluorides, with <b>antimony</b> pentafluoride the strongest neutral Lewis acid known.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the Chinese {{have contributed}} to the city economy since their {{migration}} during the Brunei Sultanate period after the discovery of <b>antimony</b> ore and also during the Charles Vyner Brooke administration who encouraged the migration of the overseas Chinese to planting black pepper.|$|E
5|$|The known {{chalcogenides}} of americium {{include the}} sulfide AmS2, selenides AmSe2 and Am3Se4, and tellurides Am2Te3 and AmTe2. The pnictides of americium (243Am) of the AmX type {{are known for}} the elements phosphorus, arsenic, <b>antimony</b> and bismuth. They crystallize in the rock-salt lattice.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth metal {{has been}} known since ancient times, {{although}} it was often confused with lead and tin, which share some physical properties. The etymology is uncertain, but possibly comes from Arabic bi ismid, meaning having the properties of <b>antimony</b> or the German words weiße Masse or Wismuth ("white mass"), translated in the mid-sixteenth century to New Latin bisemutum.|$|E
5|$|Compounds of boron, silicon, arsenic and <b>antimony</b> {{have been}} used as flame {{retardant}}s. Boron, in the form of borax, {{has been used as a}} textile flame retardant since at least the 18th century. Silicon compounds such as silicones, silanes, silsesquioxane, silica and silicates, some of which were developed as alternatives to more toxic halogenated products, can considerably improve the flame retardancy of plastic materials.|$|E
5|$|Han van Meegeren {{knew that}} white lead was used during Vermeer’s time, {{but of course}} he had to obtain his stocks through the modern colour trade, which had changed {{significantly}} since the 17th century. During Vermeer’s time, Dutch lead was mined from deposits located in the Low Countries; however, by the 19th century, most lead was imported from Australia and the Americas, and differed from the white lead that Vermeer would have used both in the isotope composition of the lead and in the content of trace elements found in the ores. Dutch white lead was extracted from ores containing high levels of trace elements of silver and <b>antimony,</b> while the modern white lead used by Van Meegeren contained neither silver nor <b>antimony,</b> as those elements are separated from the lead during the modern smelting process.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to dissolved gases, hot water from geothermal sources may hold in solution trace amounts of toxic {{elements such as}} mercury, arsenic, boron, and <b>antimony.</b> These chemicals precipitate as the water cools, and can cause environmental damage if released. The modern practice of injecting cooled geothermal fluids back into the Earth to stimulate production has the side benefit of reducing this environmental risk.|$|E
5|$|More {{sophisticated}} classification {{arrangements were}} proposed by Pseudo-Geber (in the Geber corpus, c. 1310), Paracelsus (De Natura Rerum libri nonem, 1525–6; and later works), Basil Valentine (Conclusiones, 1624), and Boerhaave (Elementa Chemiæ, 1733). They attempted {{to separate the}} more characteristic metals from substances having those characteristics to a lesser degree. Such substances included zinc, <b>antimony,</b> bismuth, stibnite, pyrite and galena. These were all then called semimetals or bastard metals.|$|E
5|$|Other {{heavy metals}} noted for their {{potentially}} hazardous nature, usually as toxic environmental pollutants, include manganese (central nervous system damage); cobalt and nickel (carcinogens); copper, zinc, selenium and silver (endocrine disruption, congenital disorders, or general toxic effects in fish, plants, birds, or other aquatic organisms); tin, as organotin (central nervous system damage); <b>antimony</b> (a suspected carcinogen); and thallium (central nervous system damage).|$|E
5|$|Rubidium is {{approximately}} as abundant as zinc and more abundant than copper. It occurs naturally in the minerals leucite, pollucite, carnallite, zinnwaldite, and lepidolite, {{although none of}} these contain only rubidium and no other alkali metals. Caesium is more abundant than some commonly known elements, such as <b>antimony,</b> cadmium, tin, and tungsten, but is much less abundant than rubidium.|$|E
5|$|Sulfides, selenides and tellurides of curium {{have been}} {{obtained}} by treating curium with gaseous sulfur, selenium or tellurium in vacuum at elevated temperature. The pnictides of curium of the type CmX are known for the elements nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic and <b>antimony.</b> They can be prepared by reacting either curium(III) hydride (CmH3) or metallic curium with these elements at elevated temperatures.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians {{are also}} {{thought to have}} come into {{knowledge}} about elements such as <b>antimony,</b> copper, crude arsenic, lead, opium, and mandrake (among others) which are mentioned in papyri. Egyptians are now {{thought to be the}} first to master distillation, and to manipulate the poison that can be retrieved from apricot kernels.|$|E
5|$|The diamond allotrope {{of carbon}} is clearly nonmetallic, being {{translucent}} {{and having a}} low electrical conductivity of 10−14 to 10−16S·cm−1. Graphite has an electrical conductivity of 3 × 104S·cm−1, a figure more characteristic of a metal. Phosphorus, sulfur, arsenic, selenium, <b>antimony</b> and bismuth also have less stable allotropes that display different behaviours.|$|E
5|$|The main lead-bearing mineral is galena (PbS), {{which is}} mostly found with zinc ores. Most other lead {{minerals}} {{are related to}} galena in some way; boulangerite, Pb5Sb4S11, is a mixed sulfide derived from galena; anglesite, PbSO4, {{is a product of}} galena oxidation; and cerussite or white lead ore, PbCO3, is a decomposition product of galena. Arsenic, tin, <b>antimony,</b> silver, gold, copper, and bismuth are common impurities in lead minerals.|$|E
5|$|The {{number and}} identities of {{metalloids}} {{depend on what}} classification criteria are used. Emsley recognised four metalloids (germanium, arsenic, <b>antimony</b> and tellurium); James et al. listed twelve (Emsley's plus boron, carbon, silicon, selenium, bismuth, polonium, moscovium and livermorium). On average, seven elements are included in such lists; individual classification arrangements tend to share common ground and vary in the ill-defined margins.|$|E
5|$|The six {{commonly}} recognised metalloids are boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, <b>antimony,</b> and tellurium. Five {{elements are}} less frequently so classified: carbon, aluminium, selenium, polonium, and astatine. On a standard periodic table, all eleven {{are in a}} diagonal area in the p-block extending from boron at the upper left to astatine at lower right, along the dividing line between metals and nonmetals shown on some periodic tables.|$|E
5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} react readily with {{phosphorus}} and arsenic to form phosphides and arsenides with the formula M3Pn (where M represents an alkali metal and Pn represents a pnictogen – phosphorus, arsenic, <b>antimony,</b> or bismuth). This {{is due to}} the greater size of the P3− and As3− ions, so that less lattice energy needs to be released for the salts to form. These are not the only phosphides and arsenides of the alkali metals: for example, potassium has nine different known phosphides, with formulae K3P, K4P3, K5P4, KP, K4P6, K3P7, K3P11, KP10.3, and KP15. While most metals form arsenides, only the alkali and alkaline earth metals form mostly ionic arsenides. The structure of Na3As is complex with unusually short Na–Na distances of 328–330 pm which are shorter than in sodium metal, and this indicates that even with these electropositive metals the bonding cannot be straightforwardly ionic. Other alkali metal arsenides not conforming to the formula M3As are known, such as LiAs, which has a metallic lustre and electrical conductivity indicating the presence of some metallic bonding. The antimonides are unstable and reactive as the Sb3− ion is a strong reducing agent; reaction of them with acids form the toxic and unstable gas stibine (SbH3). Indeed, they have some metallic properties, and the alkali metal antimonides of stoichiometry MSb involve <b>antimony</b> atoms bonded in a spiral Zintl structure. Bismuthides are not even wholly ionic; they are intermetallic compounds containing partially metallic and partially ionic bonds.|$|E
5|$|At ambient {{conditions}} bismuth shares the same layered structure as the metallic forms of arsenic and <b>antimony,</b> crystallizing in the rhombohedral lattice (Pearson symbol hR6, space group Rm No. 166), {{which is often}} classed into trigonal or hexagonal crystal systems. When compressed at room temperature, this Bi-I structure changes first to the monoclinic Bi-II at 2.55 GPa, then to the tetragonal Bi-III at 2.7 GPa, and finally to the body-centered cubic Bi-IV at 7.7 GPa. The corresponding transitions can be monitored via changes in electrical conductivity; they are rather reproducible and abrupt, and are therefore used for calibration of high-pressure equipment.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth is a {{chemical}} element with symbolBi and atomic number 83. Bismuth, a pentavalent post-transition metal {{and one of}} the pnictogens, chemically resembles its lighter homologs arsenic and <b>antimony.</b> Elemental bismuth may occur naturally, although its sulfide and oxide form important commercial ores. The free element is 86% as dense as lead. It is a brittle metal with a silvery white color when freshly produced, but surface oxidation can give it a pink tinge. Bismuth is the most naturally diamagnetic element, and has one of the lowest values of thermal conductivity among metals.|$|E
5|$|Boron trifluoride and trichloride {{are used}} as {{catalysts}} in organic synthesis and electronics; the tribromide {{is used in the}} manufacture of diborane. Non-toxic boron ligands could replace toxic phosphorus ligands in some transition metal catalysts. Silica sulfuric acid (SiO2OSO3H) is used in organic reactions. Germanium dioxide is sometimes used as a catalyst in the production of PET plastic for containers; cheaper <b>antimony</b> compounds, such as the trioxide or triacetate, are more commonly employed for the same purpose despite concerns about <b>antimony</b> contamination of food and drinks. Arsenic trioxide has been used in the production of natural gas, to boost the removal of carbon dioxide, as have selenous acid and tellurous acid. Selenium acts as a catalyst in some microorganisms. Tellurium, and its dioxide and tetrachloride, are strong catalysts for air oxidation of carbon above 500°C. Graphite oxide {{can be used as a}} catalyst in the synthesis of imines and their derivatives. Activated carbon and alumina have been used as catalysts for the removal of sulfur contaminants from natural gas. Titanium doped aluminium has been identified as a substitute for expensive noble metal catalysts used in the production of industrial chemicals.|$|E
5|$|Boron, silicon, germanium, <b>antimony</b> and tellurium, {{as well as}} heavier {{metals and}} {{metalloids}} such as Sm, Hg, Tl, Pb, Bi and Se, {{can be found in}} topological insulators. These are alloys or compounds which, at ultracold temperatures or room temperature (depending on their composition), are metallic conductors on their surfaces but insulators through their interiors. Cadmium arsenide Cd3As2, at about 1 K, is a Dirac-semimetal—a bulk electronic analogue of graphene—in which electrons travel effectively as massless particles. These two classes of material are thought to have potential quantum computing applications.|$|E
5|$|Elemental gallium is {{not found}} in nature, but it is easily {{obtained}} by smelting. Very pure gallium metal has a silvery color and its solid metal fractures conchoidally like glass. Gallium liquid expands by 3.1% when it solidifies; therefore, {{it should not be}} stored in glass or metal containers because the container may rupture when the gallium changes state. Gallium shares the higher-density liquid state with a short list of other materials that includes water, silicon, germanium, <b>antimony,</b> bismuth, and plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Fraud and forgery are {{described}} in detail; in particular coin counterfeiting by mixing copper with silver, or even admixture with iron. Tests had been developed for counterfeit coins and proved very popular with the victims, mostly ordinary people. He deals with the liquid metal mercury, also found in silver mines. He records that it is toxic, and amalgamates with gold, so is used for refining and extracting that metal. He says mercury is used for gilding copper, while <b>antimony</b> is found in silver mines and is used as an eyebrow cosmetic.|$|E
5|$|Lead and tin: high density; {{extremely}} close dimensional accuracy; used for special forms of corrosion resistance. Such alloys {{are not used}} in foodservice applications for public health reasons. Type metal, an alloy of lead, tin and <b>antimony</b> (with sometimes traces of copper) is used for casting hand-set type in letterpress printing and hot foil blocking. Traditionally cast in hand jerk moulds now predominantly die cast after the industrialisation of the type foundries. Around 1900 the slug casting machines came onto the market and added further automation, with sometimes dozens of casting machines at one newspaper office.|$|E
5|$|Lead is a {{very soft}} metal with a Mohs {{hardness}} of 1.5; it can be scratched with a fingernail. It is quite malleable and somewhat ductile. The bulk modulus of lead—a measure of its ease of compressibility—is 45.8GPa. In comparison, that of aluminium is 75.2GPa; copper 137.8GPa; and mild steel 160–169GPa. Lead's tensile strength, at 12–17 MPa, is low (that of aluminium is 6 times higher, copper 10 times, and mild steel 15 times higher); it can be strengthened by adding small amounts of copper or <b>antimony.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other {{elements}} occasionally {{are classified}} as metalloids. These elements include hydrogen, beryllium, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, zinc, gallium, tin, iodine, lead, bismuth, and radon. The term metalloid also {{has been used for}} elements that exhibit metallic lustre and electrical conductivity, and that are amphoteric, such as arsenic, <b>antimony,</b> vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, tin, lead, and aluminium. The p-block metals, and nonmetals (such as carbon or nitrogen) that can form alloys with metals or modify their properties also have occasionally been considered as metalloids.|$|E
