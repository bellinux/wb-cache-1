5|$|In 1894, Marquis {{enrolled}} at University Medical College, Kansas City. A year of study {{was sufficient to}} allow him to practice medicine under the supervision of his father at Bosworth, Missouri, where the pair set up a practice and opened a drugstore. The practice was not very successful, so Marquis and his wife moved to Coloma where he worked under the supervision of another doctor. Marquis completed his studies with financial help from his wife's family and summer work as a printer in <b>Anaconda.</b> He graduated March23, 1898, and returned to Montana. His daughter, Minnie-Ellen, was born soon after in <b>Anaconda.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, Cripple Creek was {{the largest}} town in the gold-mining {{district}} that included the towns of Altman, <b>Anaconda,</b> Arequa, Goldfield, Elkton, Independence and Victor, about 20 miles from Colorado Springs on the southwest side of Pikes Peak. Surface gold was discovered in the area in 1891, and within three years more than 150 mines were operating there.|$|E
5|$|During the 2001 {{invasion}} of Afghanistan, A-10s {{did not take}} part in the initial stages. For the campaign against Taliban and Al Qaeda, A-10 squadrons were deployed to Pakistan and Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan, beginning in March 2002.

5000|$|Reports {{of giant}} <b>anacondas</b> date {{back as far}} as the European {{colonization}} of South America, when sightings of giant <b>anacondas</b> began to circulate amongst colonists. The size of the largest <b>anacondas</b> {{has been the subject of}} debate ever since among cryptozoologists and zoologists.|$|R
50|$|While {{encounters}} {{between people}} and <b>anacondas</b> may be dangerous, they do not regularly hunt humans. Nevertheless, threat from <b>anacondas</b> is a familiar trope in comics, movies and adventure stories set in the Amazon jungle. <b>Anacondas</b> have also figured prominently in South American folklore, where they are sometimes depicted as shapeshifting mythical creatures called encantados. Local communities and some European explorers have given accounts of giant <b>anacondas,</b> legendary snakes of much greater proportion than any confirmed specimen.|$|R
50|$|The Los Angeles <b>Anacondas</b> were an International Fight League team {{based in}} Los Angeles, California. The <b>Anacondas</b> {{were the first}} IFL team to have gone through not just one coach but two. Originally coached by three time King of Pancrase and former UFC Heavyweight Champion Bas Rutten, and then coached by Canadian MMA {{practitioner}} Shawn Tompkins, the <b>Anacondas</b> are now without a coach entering the offseason.|$|R
5|$|Many {{operating}} systems include Python {{as a standard}} component; the language ships with most Linux distributions, AmigaOS 4, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and macOS, {{and can be used}} from the terminal. Many Linux distributions use installers written in Python: Ubuntu uses the Ubiquity installer, while Red Hat Linux and Fedora use the <b>Anaconda</b> installer. Gentoo Linux uses Python in its package management system, Portage.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long before}} this dispute, miners at Cripple Creek had formed the Free Coinage Union. Once the new changes went into effect, they {{affiliated}} with the Western Federation of Miners, and became Local 19. The union was based in Altman, and had chapters in <b>Anaconda,</b> Cripple Creek and Victor.|$|E
5|$|On 13 February 2002, Mikolashek ordered Hagenbeck to move CFLCC (Forward) to Bagram {{airfield}} {{located at}} Bagram and 2 {{days later the}} headquarters was officially redesignated as Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) Mountain. It assumed responsibility for the planning and execution of what had then become known as Operation <b>Anaconda.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Anacondas</b> {{were one}} of four teams {{competing}} in the IFL's inaugural season. As of March 2007, the <b>Anacondas</b> were the only IFL team to hold two perfect sweeps (5 wins and no losses) over opposing teams (the Tokyo Sabres on September 9, 2006 and the San Jose Razorclaws on March 17, 2007).|$|R

After defeating the <b>Anacondas</b> in the semi-finals the Silverbacks were defeated by the New York Pitbulls in the 2007 finals.|$|R
5|$|These units linked {{up several}} times during this war and engaged in several furious battles with the enemy. One such battle {{happened}} during Operation <b>Anaconda</b> the mission to squeeze life out of a Taliban and Al-Qaeda stronghold dug deep into the Shah-i-Kot mountains of eastern Afghanistan. The operation was seen {{as one of the}} heaviest and bloodiest fights in the War in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|After the {{completion}} of the FOB, 411th Engineer Brigade soldiers commenced construction on other facilities throughout Camp Liberty for other incoming Army units. At the same time, other units in the brigade were responsible for route clearance in the areas of Logistics Support Area <b>Anaconda</b> along routes used for military supply as well as civilian traffic. The brigade's soldiers used Buffalo mine protected vehicles to clear these routes of suspected Improvised Explosive Devices and other dangerous obstacles.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, {{there was}} serious {{flooding}} in Salford, {{caused by a}} bottleneck at {{a bend in the}} river at Strangeways, on the border with Manchester. Flooding had been a problem for hundreds of years, and, in 1946, {{the decision was made to}} straighten and widen the river to increase its capacity. Work started in 1951 but it was not until September 1970 that water first flowed through the <b>Anaconda</b> Cut. The total cost of the project was £2m.|$|E

5|$|In late 2001, {{following}} the 11 September 2001 attacks, {{elements of the}} brigade's 1-87th Infantry, deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. These forces remained in the country until mid-2002, fighting to secure remote {{areas of the country}} and participating in prominent operations such as Operation <b>Anaconda,</b> the Fall of Mazar-i-Sharif, and the Battle of Qala-i-Jangi. The division also participated in fighting in the Shahi Khot Valley in 2002. Upon the return of the battalions, they were welcomed home and praised by President Bush.|$|E
5|$|Vicksburg was {{the last}} major Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River; therefore, {{capturing}} it completed {{the second part of}} the Northern strategy, the <b>Anaconda</b> Plan. When two major assaults (May 19 and 22, 1863) against the Confederate fortifications were repulsed with heavy casualties, Grant decided to besiege the city beginning on May 25. After holding out for more than forty days, with no reinforcement and supplies nearly gone, the garrison finally surrendered on July 4.|$|E
5|$|Winfield Scott, the {{commanding}} {{general of the}} U.S. Army {{at the beginning of}} the war, devised the <b>Anaconda</b> Plan to win the war with as little bloodshed as possible. His idea was that a Union blockade of the main ports would weaken the Confederate economy; then the capture of the Mississippi River would split the South. Lincoln adopted the plan in terms of a blockade to squeeze to death the Confederate economy, but overruled Scott's warnings that his new army was not ready for an offensive operation because public opinion demanded an immediate attack.|$|E

The division also participated in fighting in the Shahi Khot Valley in 2002. In June 2002, elements of the 82nd Airborne Division arrived to relieve CJTF Mountain, and in September, Major General John R. Vines and his Combined Task Force 82 relieved CJTF Mountain as the major subordinate headquarters to Combined Joint Task Force 180. Upon the return of the battalions, they were welcomed home and praised by President Bush.|$|E
5|$|Following the 11 September 2001 attacks, {{elements}} of the division, including its special troops battalion and the 1-87th Infantry and 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment (4–31 Infantry), deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in late 2001.

5|$|In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Irwell's lower reaches were {{a trading}} route that {{became part of}} the Mersey and Irwell Navigation. In the 19th century, the river's course {{downstream}} of Manchester was permanently altered by the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal which opened in 1896. The canal turned Manchester and Salford into a major inland seaport and {{led to the development of}} Trafford Park which became the largest industrial estate in Europe. Further changes were made in the 20th and 21st centuries to prevent flooding in Manchester and Salford, such as the <b>Anaconda</b> Cut in 1970 and the River Irwell Flood Defence Scheme in 2014.|$|E
2500|$|The bank is {{planning}} to procure green <b>anacondas</b> under an international exchange programme. Four adult green <b>anacondas,</b> with an average length of , are being brought {{for the first time}} from the Danish Crocodile Exhibition in Denmark in exchange for marsh crocodiles, critically endangered gharials and African slender snouted crocodiles. The <b>anacondas</b> have since been procured and are housed in enclosures. As part of the efforts to give due importance to its exhibition potential, along with education and research, the bank was also engaged in talks with some conservation and breeding centres to procure Komodo dragons. Four Komodo dragons - three males, one female - have since been acquired from Bronx Zoo in New York. The bank also plans to get as many as 21 spotted pond turtles from Hong Kong. The 2012-2013 Annual Report of MCBT states that it {{is planning}} to acquire one Northern river terrapin from Vienna Zoo ...|$|R

5|$|The 130th was {{headquartered}} at Logistical Support Area <b>Anaconda</b> for {{the majority}} of the deployment. Throughout Operation Iraqi Freedom, the headquarters commanded up to 15,000 engineers at one time, conducting missions including bridging, humanitarian assistance, topographic missions, dive missions, firefighting, base construction, river patrols, mine detection, missile removal and many more. Brigade units redeployed to Hanau in late 2003 and early 2004. Most of the brigade's soldiers returned to Hanau on 5 February 2004 after numerous logistical delays. Most of the 130th Engineer Brigade's subordinate units would receive Meritorious Unit Commendation for their roles in the invasion of Iraq, though the Brigade's headquarters did not.|$|E
5|$|U.S. Apaches {{served in}} Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan from 2001. The Apache {{was the only}} Army {{platform}} capable of providing accurate CAS duties for Operation <b>Anaconda,</b> regularly taking fire during the intense early fighting, they were typically repaired quickly. U.S. AH-64Ds typically flew in Afghanistan and Iraq without the Longbow Radar {{in the absence of}} armored threats. On 21 December 2009, a pair of U.S. Apaches attacked a British-held base in a friendly fire incident, killing one British soldier. In 2006, Thomas Adams noted that Apaches often fought in small teams with little autonomy to react to threats and opportunities, requiring lengthy dialogue with command structures in an effort to centrally micromanage each unit.|$|E
5|$|Adult giant otters {{living in}} family groups have no known serious natural predators, however {{there are some}} {{accounts}} of black caimans in Peru and yacare caimans in the Pantanal preying on giant otters. In addition, solitary animals and young may be vulnerable to attacks by the jaguar, cougar, and <b>anaconda,</b> but {{this is based on}} historical reports, not direct observation. Pups are more vulnerable, and may be taken by caiman and other large predators, although adults are constantly mindful of stray young, and will harass and fight off possible predators. When in the water, the giant otter faces danger from animals not strictly preying upon it: the electric eel and stingray are potentially deadly if stumbled upon, and piranha may be capable of at least taking bites out of a giant otter, as evidenced by scarring on individuals.|$|E
