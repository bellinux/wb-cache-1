40|$|AbstractPreferences <b>and</b> <b>choices</b> in {{a society}} are {{constant}} dynamic operations, based upon the behavioral dynamism of people. Housing preferences <b>and</b> <b>choices</b> operate {{within the framework of}} preferences <b>and</b> <b>choices</b> for housing attributes. There are underlying motivations that make it possible for an individual to choose from available alternatives within a given product field. This paper examines and outlines the methodological and theoretical framework of housing preferences <b>and</b> <b>choices,</b> based on the theory of means-end chain (MEC). In dealing with user preference of housing, {{there is a need for}} research for a development of a technological tool for the identification of user needs and preference...|$|R

5|$|Kierkegaard {{argues that}} Hegel's {{philosophy}} dehumanized life by denying personal freedom <b>and</b> <b>choice</b> through the neutralization of the 'either/or'. The dialectic structure of becoming renders existence far too easy, in Hegel's theory, because conflicts are eventually mediated and disappear automatically through a natural process that requires no individual choice {{other than a}} submission {{to the will of}} the Idea or Geist. Kierkegaard saw this as a denial of true selfhood and instead advocated the importance of personal responsibility and choice-making.|$|E

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} in modelling how people make choices that involve both risks and delays, i. e., risky inter-temporal choices. We investigated an untested assumption underlying several proposed risky inter-temporal choice models: that pure risky <b>choices</b> <b>and</b> pure inter-temporal <b>choices</b> are special cases of risky inter-temporal choice. We tested this assumption by presenting a single group of participants with risky <b>choices</b> <b>and</b> inter-temporal <b>choices.</b> We then compared {{the performance of a}} model that is fit to both choice types simultaneously, with the performance of separate models fit to the risky <b>choice</b> <b>and</b> inter-temporal <b>choice</b> data. We find, using Bayesian model comparison, that the majority of participants are best fit by a single model that incorporates both risky <b>and</b> inter-temporal <b>choices.</b> This result supports the assumption that risky <b>choices</b> <b>and</b> inter-temporal <b>choices</b> may be special cases of risky inter-temporal choice. Our results also suggest that, under the conditions of our experiment, interpretation of monetary value is very similar in risky <b>choices</b> <b>and</b> inter-temporal <b>choices...</b>|$|R

The research also investigates students’ perceptions of their own perceived competence as future CJ practitioners. Data were collected from CJ undergraduates from an urban university in the upper Midwestern part of the U. S. The results indicate that racial or ethnic minority students have significantly different career goals <b>and</b> <b>choices</b> than those of non-minority students.

5|$|An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump is a 1768 oil-on-canvas {{painting}} by Joseph Wright of Derby, {{one of a}} number of candlelit scenes that Wright painted during the 1760s. The painting departed from convention of the time by depicting a scientific subject in the reverential manner formerly reserved for scenes of historical or religious significance. Wright was intimately involved in depicting the Industrial Revolution and the scientific advances of the Enlightenment, but while his paintings were recognised as something out of the ordinary by his contemporaries, his provincial status <b>and</b> <b>choice</b> of subjects meant the style was never widely imitated. The picture has been owned by the National Gallery, London, since 1863 and is still regarded as a masterpiece of British art. In June 2015 it was on loan to Tate Britain.|$|E
5|$|Anne {{was born}} in the reign of her uncle Charles II, who had no {{legitimate}} children. Her father, James, was thus heir presumptive to the throne. His suspected Roman Catholicism was unpopular in England, and on Charles's instructions Anne and her elder sister, Mary, were raised as Anglicans. Three years after he succeeded Charles, James was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Anne's sister and Dutch Protestant brother-in-law and cousin William III of Orange became joint monarchs. Although the sisters had been close, disagreements over Anne's finances, status <b>and</b> <b>choice</b> of acquaintances arose shortly after Mary's accession and they became estranged. William and Mary had no children. After Mary's death in 1694, William reigned alone until his own death in 1702, when Anne succeeded him.|$|E

5|$|No chronicler {{for this}} period is entirely {{trustworthy}} or unbiased, often because their accounts were written {{to support a}} particular cause, {{but it is clear}} that most contemporary chroniclers were highly critical of Edward. The Polychronicon, Vita Edwardi Secundi, Vita et Mors Edwardi Secundi and the Gesta Edwardi de Carnarvon for example all condemned the King's personality, habits <b>and</b> <b>choice</b> of companions. Other records from his reign show criticism of Edward by his contemporaries, including the Church and members of his own household. Political songs were written about him, complaining about his failure in war and his oppressive government. Later in the 14th century, some chroniclers, such as Geoffrey le Baker and Thomas Ringstead, rehabilitated Edward, presenting him as a martyr and a potential saint, although this tradition died out in later years.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} uses social cues in its {{evaluation}} <b>and</b> <b>choice</b> of nesting sites. In particular, it {{listens to}} the post-breeding songs given out by other males. These songs have strong temporal dependencies. Males sing {{at the beginning and}} the peak of breeding season, but songs are not indicative of reproductive success. Near the end of a breeding season, a male that has successfully mated continues to sing while a male that has failed to reproduce abandons the habitat. Therefore, post-breeding songs are reliable indicators of reproductive success within the particular habitat and convey essential information to the natal and breeding dispersers. In comparison to the traditional idea of direct assessment of the vegetation structure, the vocal cue is much more efficient and easier to obtain, hence revealing the advantage of social communication in survival and reproduction. A female, however, does not respond to post-breeding songs directly. Instead, she is likely to rely on the presence of males in deciding nesting sites.|$|E
