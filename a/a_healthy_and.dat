5|$|Crosby put {{together}} <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>and</b> productive year in 13–14, playing 80 {{games for the}} first time since the 2009–10 season. Crosby finished the season with 36 goals and a league-leading 68 assists. It marked the first time in his career that he led the league in assists. He also finished with a league-high 104 points, winning the Art Ross Trophy for the second time in his career. Crosby and the Penguins finished second in the east to the Bruins, and were matched up with new division rival the Columbus Blue Jackets in the first round. Despite a very back-and-forth series and not a single goal by Crosby, the Penguins defeated the Jackets in 6 games to advance to a second-round matchup with longtime rival the New York Rangers. Going into their second-round series with the Rangers, Crosby looked to end a long playoff goal drought, which dated back to the 2013 Eastern Conference Finals against the Boston Bruins. After dropping Game 1 at home, Crosby finally broke his goal drought in Game 2, as the Pens tied the series at 1–1 heading back to Madison Square Garden. The Penguins would capitalize on their Game 2 win, taking next two games and destroying the Rangers home ice advantage. However, the Rangers would quickly rebound, winning Game 5 and 6, forcing a Game 7 in Pittsburgh. The Penguins would complete an epic playoff collapse, as they dropped Game 7 to the Rangers, and headed home without a prize for the fifth straight season. The team's collapse prompted Penguins ownership to fire general manager Ray Shero, replacing him with Jim Rutherford, the former general manager of the Carolina Hurricanes. Rutherford's first action as GM was to relieve Dan Bylsma of his duties, and on June 25, he announced that Mike Johnston was hired as new head coach. On May 1, Crosby, along with fellow captains Ryan Getzlaf and Claude Giroux, was named a finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy. It marked the fourth time in his career Crosby was named a top three finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy, and his first win since 2006–07. Crosby also collected his third Ted Lindsay Award, as the players choice for the best player in the league.|$|E

As with many large breeds, hip dysplasia, a painful and potentially debilitating condition, is not uncommon. Good genetics and proper nutrition as a puppy are key to avoiding these complications.|$|E

25|$|Childbirth in Ghana {{is often}} seen as a joyous {{occasion}} in Ghanaian society, as children represent wealth, status, and the continuation of a lineage. Pregnant women are often given special privileges and {{are considered to be}} beautiful, fragile, and vulnerable to evil spirits. Therefore, women may seek guidance from a religious or spiritual diviner to protect their fetus or to increase their chances of conceiving. For example, the Akan may carry akuaba dolls, a fertility symbol, during pregnancy to ensure that they will birth <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>and</b> beautiful baby that resembles the doll's exaggerated features.|$|E
25|$|Greyhounds are {{typically}} <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>and</b> long-lived breed, and hereditary illness is rare. Some Greyhounds {{have been known}} to develop esophageal achalasia, gastric dilatation volvulus (also known as bloat), and osteosarcoma. If exposed to E. coli, they may develop Alabama rot. Because the Greyhound's lean physique makes it ill-suited to sleeping on hard surfaces, owners of both racing and companion Greyhounds generally provide soft bedding; without bedding, Greyhounds are prone to develop painful skin sores. The average lifespan of a Greyhound is 9 to 11 years.|$|E

CCHC administers a Perpetually Affordable Housing (PAH) Program consisting of 41 ownership and 60 rental housing units at below-market purchase prices and rental rates.

25|$|In 1858 Jules Perrot {{retired to}} his native France, never to return to Russia again. Petipa {{anticipated}} succeeding Perrot as premier maître de ballet. His years of serving as assistant to Perrot had taught him much. Choreography was a logical alternative to dancing for the now 41-year-old Petipa, who was soon to retire from the stage. But {{it was not yet}} to be. In 1860 the renowned French Ballet Master Arthur Saint-Léon was given the coveted position by the director of the Imperial Theatres Andrei Saburov, and soon <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>and</b> productive rivalry between him and Petipa ensued, bringing the Imperial Ballet to new heights throughout the 1860s.|$|E

25|$|By rationally {{seeking the}} truth, {{thinking}} freely, holding free discussions and testing teachings and authorities, freethinkers strive towards the full {{development of the}} human personality, {{with the emphasis on}} moral and rational conscience. This includes amongst other things an atheistic worldview, the choice for solidarity with fellow human beings, and the realisation that life is finite and a one-off occurrence. Also, physical and emotional development is considered important for <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>and</b> happy life. Precisely because life is finite, it is unique and valuable, and should be experienced to the fullest. Emotionally, one needs to cope with doubt, because the critical examination of one's own dearly held beliefs, and letting go of them if they turn out to be false, is necessary to seek the truth.|$|E
25|$|Gay activist Jonathan Rauch {{has argued}} that {{marriage}} is good for all men, whether homosexual or heterosexual, because engaging in its social roles reduces men's aggression and promiscuity. The data of current psychological and other social science studies on same-sex marriage in comparison to mixed-sex marriage indicate that same-sex and mixed-sex relationships do not differ in their essential psychosocial dimensions; that a parent's sexual orientation is unrelated {{to their ability to}} provide <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>and</b> nurturing family environment; and that marriage bestows substantial psychological, social, and health benefits. Same-sex parents and carers and their children are likely to benefit in numerous ways from legal recognition of their families, and providing such recognition through marriage will bestow greater benefit than civil unions or domestic partnerships.|$|E
25|$|Malnutrition {{refers to}} insufficient, excessive, or {{imbalanced}} consumption of nutrients by an organism.
