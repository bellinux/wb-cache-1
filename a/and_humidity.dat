40|$|This {{research}} was aimed to control thermal environment (temperature <b>and</b> relative <b>humidity)</b> in airconditioned rooms {{in order to}} reach thermal comfort and good health for the people in hospital. This {{research was}} divided into 2 sections: Section 1 studies the direct and indirect influence of relative humidity on the health of people inside hospital buildings and the appropriate relative <b>humidity</b> <b>and</b> temperature to achieve thermal comfort and good health for Thailand by using Delphi technique; Section 2 develops single phase air conditioning system using inverter to control thermal environment (temperature <b>and</b> relative <b>humidity)</b> inside the room to reach the appropriate temperature <b>and</b> relative <b>humidity.</b> The results in Section 1 showed that too high and too low relative <b>humidity</b> had direct <b>and</b> indirect effects on sick building syndrome (SBS), illness, respiratory diseases, growth and distribution of bacteria, virus, and house dust mite. The appropriate temperature <b>and</b> relative <b>humidity</b> for Thailand were 26 degrees Celsius and 50 - 60 %, respectively. The results in Section 2 showed that the developed system could control temperature <b>and</b> relative <b>humidity</b> at the desired level with the changes in temperature <b>and</b> relative <b>humidity</b> in the range of + 0. 35 degrees Celsius and 50 - 60 %, respectively.

5|$|As {{a result}} of their warming effects when {{relatively}} thin, cirrus clouds have been implicated as a potential partial cause of global warming. Scientists have speculated that global warming could cause high thin cloud cover to increase, thereby increasing temperatures <b>and</b> <b>humidity.</b> This, in turn, would increase the cirrus cloud cover, effectively creating a positive feedback circuit. A prediction of this hypothesis is that the cirrus would move higher as the temperatures rose, increasing the volume of air underneath the clouds and the amount of infrared radiation reflected back down to earth. In addition, the hypothesis suggests that the increase in temperature would tend to increase the size of the ice crystals in the cirrus cloud, possibly causing the reflection of solar radiation and the reflection of the Earth's infrared radiation to balance out.|$|E
5|$|Ash {{particles}} {{are incorporated into}} eruption columns as they are ejected from the vent at high velocity. The initial momentum from the eruption propels the column upwards. As air is drawn into the column, the bulk density decreases and it starts to rise buoyantly into the atmosphere. At {{a point where the}} bulk density of the column {{is the same as the}} surrounding atmosphere, the column will cease rising and start moving laterally. Lateral dispersion is controlled by prevailing winds and the ash may be deposited hundreds to thousands of kilometres from the volcano, depending on eruption column height, particle size of the ash and climatic conditions (especially wind direction and strength <b>and</b> <b>humidity).</b>|$|E
