40|$|Taiwan has {{not been}} able to join the {{existing}} global climate regime because of its ambiguous international status. The Kyoto Protocol and the restrictive <b>accession</b> <b>rules</b> of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) preclude Taiwan’s membership. The government of Taiwan is preparing to join the post- 2012 multilateral climate regime by building its capacity to regulate greenhouse gases and by setting reduction targets. Taiwan currently contributes about 1 % of the total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in the world. It has its share of responsibility in global warming and should be included as part of the solution. Taiwan’s participation in the World Health Assembly in 2009 suggests that the People’s Republic of China might be willing to accept Taiwan’s participation in international treaties as long as membership does not imply statehood.

These events prompted a reduction in employment rates of older individuals {{and an increase in}} the financial pressure of the social security systems which, coupled with the ageing of the society, triggered a shift in the policy focus towards ways of keeping older workers active in the labor market (Fischer et al. 2006). To achieve this goal, governments introduced several policies like monetary incentives for firms to hire older workers or limitations in the <b>accession</b> <b>rules</b> to the early retirement schemes. However, in many cases these efforts have not been translated into increases in activity rates of older workers because many of them are able to leave the labor market through alternative programs such as the disability or unemployment schemes.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a different basis than previous analyses for regional bloc formation and regional migration. Due to low bargaining power and fixed costs, small states face a severe disadvantage in negotiations {{with the rest of}} the world and might benefit by forming a regional bloc. The study a) presents a general equilibrium model where bargaining power, international (IC) and regional (RC) negotiation costs, number of issues negotiated (N), and <b>accession</b> <b>rule</b> to the bloc determine its size and welfare impact, and b) examines the impact of international migration as well as the migration-trade relationship. The main findings are: i) the likelihood of regional bloc formation, its size and welfare impact increases with IC, N and decreases with RC; ii) bloc size is optimal (below the optimum) if an accession fee is (is not) charged; iii) South-South migration raises bloc size and welfare; iv) South-South migration and trade are complements under market access negotiations and are substitutes under negotiations for unilateral transfers as well as under migrant remittances; and vi) South-North migration and bloc formation, and South-North and South-South migration, are substitutes for the states that benefit from membership in the bloc. small states, regional cooperation, South-South migration, South-North migration, trade...|$|R

50|$|Since he {{was already}} {{advanced}} in age upon his <b>accession,</b> Ay <b>ruled</b> Egypt {{in his own right}} for only four years. During this period, he consolidated the return to the old religious ways that he had initiated as senior advisor and constructed a mortuary temple at Medinet Habu for his own use. A stela of Nakhtmin (Berlin 2074), a military officer under Tutankhamun and Ay—who was Ay's chosen successor—is dated to Year 4, IV Akhet day 1 of Ay's reign. Manetho's Epitome assigns a reign length of four years and one month to Horemheb, and this was usually assigned to Ay based on this Year 4 dated stela; however, it is now believed that figure should be raised by a decade to fourteen years and one month and attributed to Horemheb instead, as Manetho intended. Hence, Ay's precise reign length is unknown and he could have ruled for as long as seven to nine years, since most of his monuments and his funerary temple at Medinet Habu were either destroyed or usurped by his successor, Horemheb.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{sets out}} to explore the puzzle of {{possible}} institutionalization or reversal of rules ‘imported’ by new member states from Central and Eastern Europe during their preparation for accession to the EU.

40|$|Structure {{preserving}} grammar compaction (SPC) is {{a simple}} CFG compaction technique originally described in (van Genabith et al., 1999 a, 1999 b).

5|$|According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Penda became king in 626, ruled for 30 years, and was 50 {{years old}} at the time of his <b>accession.</b> That he <b>ruled</b> for 30 years should not be taken as an exact figure, since the same source says he died in 655, which would not {{correspond}} to the year given for the beginning of his reign unless he died in the thirtieth year of his reign. Furthermore, that Penda was truly 50 {{years old at}} the beginning of his reign is generally doubted by historians, mainly because of the ages of his children. The idea that Penda, at about 80 years of age, would have left behind children who were still young (his son Wulfhere was still just a youth three years after Penda's death, according to Bede) has been widely considered implausible. The possibility has been suggested that the Chronicle actually meant to say that Penda was 50 {{years old at the}} time of his death, and therefore about 20 in 626.|$|R

40|$|Legal {{aspects of}} the {{accession}} of Croatia to the European Union Abstract The EU enlargement policy is a fundamental instrument of the EU's foreign and security policy that enables Union to achieve its goals such as creating a common area of peace, stability and prosperity.

Stafford was a member of the entourage that returned to England with the body, and was strictly still a minor himself at this time.

In previous work we developed methodologies for automatic feature-structure annotation of grammars extracted from treebanks. Automatic annotation of "raw 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 treebank grammars is difficult as annotation rules often need to identify subsequences in the RHSs of flat treebank rules as they explicitly encode head, complement and modifier relations. Xbar based CFG rules should substantially facilitate automatic feature-structure annotation of grammar rules. In the present paper we conduct a number of experiments to explore a space of possible grammars based on a small fragment of the AP treebank resource. Starting with the original treebank fragment we automatically extract a CFG G. We then apply an automatic structure preserving grammar compaction step which generalises categories in the original treebank fragment and reduces the number of rules extracted, resulting in a generalised treebank fragment and in a compacted grammar Gc. The generalised fragment is then manually corrected to catch missed constituents (and the like) resulting in an automatically extracted, compacted and (effectively manually) corrected grammar Gc,m. Manual correction proceeds in the "spirit 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 of treebank grammars (we do not introduce Xbar analyses).
