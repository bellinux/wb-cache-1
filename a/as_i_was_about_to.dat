On June 10, 1967, 17 days after completing what was his last film role in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, Tracy awakened at 3:00am to make himself a cup of tea in his apartment in Beverly Hills, California. Hepburn described in her autobiography how she followed him to the kitchen: [...] "Just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> give [...] a push, there was a sound of a cup smashing to the floor—then clump—a loud clump." [...] She entered the room to find Tracy lying dead from a heart attack. He was 67. Hepburn recalled, [...] "He looked so happy to be done with living, which for all his accomplishments had been a frightful burden for him." [...] MGM publicist Howard Strickling told the media that Tracy had been alone when he died and was found by his housekeeper.|$|E

60|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> answer, {{her father}} came in {{leaning on his}} stick, and, {{catching}} sight of me, instantly asked the same question.|$|E

6000|$|... "One beggar in {{the family}} is enough," [...] he used to grumble, when his wife upbraided him, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> really too tired to work. So let me alone, my Deborah, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>about</b> to take another nap." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tie {{the pole}} to a limb of that tree, and then Master Lillie may dig around the bottom {{as much as}} he pleases, for he {{will not be able to}} {{dislodge}} it unless he does <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>about</b> to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not yet, sir--not yet," [...] {{said some}} of the troopers to me, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> follow, while others pressed forward into the stream.|$|E
6000|$|... "And pray, sir," [...] {{said the}} big stranger, {{stepping}} up to me <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> move away, [...] "can you recommend me to a good hotel?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One {{thing at}} a time," [...] said the Sergeant, {{stopping}} me <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> send in search of Joyce. [...] "I must attend to Miss Verinder first." ...|$|E
60|$|Sadly discursive <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{have already}} <b>been,</b> <b>I</b> must still further entreat the reader’s patience, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>about</b> to string together, without any attempt at order, a few {{odds and ends}} of things not {{hitherto}} mentioned, but which are either curious in themselves, or peculiar to the Typees.|$|R
60|$|I mused once more. Gussie and <b>I,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> say, had rather lost touch, but all {{the same}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{exercised}} <b>about</b> the poor fish, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>about</b> all my pals, close or distant, who find themselves treading upon Life's banana skins. It {{seemed to me that}} he was up against it.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> have <b>been</b> thus {{particular}} in my {{account of the}} West Diddlesex Insurance Office, and of Mr. Brough, the managing director (though the real names are neither given to the office nor to the chairman, as you may be sure), because the fate {{of me and my}} diamond pin was mysteriously bound up with both: <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>about</b> to show.|$|R
60|$|Just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> put {{the address}} on the {{envelope}} an obstacle was discovered by Laura, which in the effort and preoccupation of writing had escaped my mind altogether.|$|E
6000|$|I saw Superstition gazing darkly at me. He {{shook his}} head <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> reply, so I changed my retort. [...] "Who, then, was Mr. Christian?" [...] I enquired simply.|$|E
60|$|I {{hurried down}} to the barn, {{and in a few}} moments had Jerry hooked up to the family turnout. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> jump in and drive to the house, a man confronted me.|$|E
6000|$|Yet <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{lay upon}} the hard {{floor of the}} tool house <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not so much {{concerned}} <b>about</b> myself <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> matters at Widow Canby's house. It would be a hardship to pass the night where <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> {{to say nothing of}} how <b>I</b> might <b>be</b> treated when Duncan Woodward and his followers returned. But in the meantime, how would Kate fare? ...|$|R
5000|$|Meursault {{were formed}} when singer-songwriter Neil Pennycook began {{performing}} with friends from {{his hometown of}} Penicuik, {{on the outskirts of}} Edinburgh in Scotland. Pennycook noted, [...] "I was into basketball, and only into basketball, until <b>I</b> <b>was</b> 21. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> passionate <b>about</b> that <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>about</b> music now. But I hurt my knee and had to take six months off, so I started playing guitar. And that was that." ...|$|R
5000|$|My second {{project is}} acting as Program Director for Fairfield University's (CT) new low-{{residency}} MFA in Creative Writing. Our first residency begins this December on Enders Island, {{off the coast}} of Mystic, Connecticut, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> busy gathering a great stable of writers to teach in the program. This is an exciting project for me, because when I'm not writing, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a teacher and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>as</b> passionate <b>about</b> teaching creative writing <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>about</b> my own writing." ...|$|R
60|$|In the end, just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> trek seawards, an old friend, Maputa, {{turned up}} at my wagons--that same man who had brought me the message from Panda before we started to attack Bangu.|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> lay {{the thing}} aside as of no value in my present predicament my eyes chanced upon a few strange {{characters}} roughly and freshly scratched upon the soft gold of the case.|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> spring {{into the}} {{conflict}} with my sharp long-sword I felt a gentle hand upon my shoulder and turning found, to my surprise, that the young woman had followed me into the chamber.|$|E
6000|$|... "Has he?" [...] I answered. [...] "Then {{he is more}} {{fortunate}} than <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> for <b>I</b> {{have never}} heard of him or what he is." [...] This, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sorry to say, was a fib, for it will be remembered that Mameena had mentioned him in the hut as one of her suitors, but among natives one must keep up one's dignity somehow. [...] "Friend Umbezi," [...] I went on, [...] "I have come to bid you farewell, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>about</b> to trek for Durban." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! ah! <b>I</b> forgot; there <b>are</b> cutlets {{and those}} sort of things. My hand is not in yet for this work, aunt. Well, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> saying <b>about</b> Cambridge--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want," [...] {{he cried}} out, [...] "what a girl wants when she wears her new frock; I want what a boy wants {{when he goes}} in for a clanging match with a monitor--I want to show {{somebody}} what a fine fellow <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>as</b> right <b>about</b> that man <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>about</b> your having a hat on your head. You say it cannot <b>be</b> tested. <b>I</b> say it can. I {{will take you to}} see my old friend Beaumont. He is a delightful man to know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hate you," [...] she said, and then, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> beg for a {{fair hearing}} she pointed over my shoulder. [...] "The thipdar comes," [...] she said, and I turned again to meet the reptile.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, Mrs Dombey,' he resumed. 'No, Madam. There is no {{possibility}} of separation between you and me, and therefore I the more advise you to be awakened {{to a sense of}} duty. And, Carker, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> say to you-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I tell thee," [...] {{said the}} mercer, {{somewhat}} disconcerted, [...] "I {{had little time}} to look at her; for just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> give her the good time of day, and for that purpose had puckered my features with a smile--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{to let you}} {{in behind}} the scenes," [...] went on Dick, to Stanley and Songbird, [...] "I am not so much worried <b>about</b> {{ourselves}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>about</b> Mrs. Stanhope and Dora and the Lanings. Sobber and old Crabtree want that fortune from Treasure Isle the worst way and they'll {{do anything to get}} hold of it. Koswell and Larkspur are probably short of funds, and, as they like to live high, they'll help Sobber and Crabtree all they can,--for a rake-off of the proceeds." ...|$|R
6000|$|Such ingratitude <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>about</b> {{to relate}} to you has never been equalled on this earth, and even after all these years, Sir, you see me {{overcome}} with emotion at the remembrance of it all. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> under arrest, remember, on a terribly serious charge, but, conscious of mine own innocence and of my unanswerable system of defence, I bore the preliminary examination by the juge d'instruc-tion with exemplary dignity and patience. I knew, you see, that at my very first confrontation with my supposed victim the latter would at once say: ...|$|R
60|$|I took {{a certain}} {{horror of the}} man, for I thought a soldier and a gentleman should confront his end with more philosophy. I made him no reply, therefore, in words; and {{presently}} the evening fell so chill that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> glad, for my own sake, to kindle a fire. And yet God knows, in such an open spot, and the country alive with savages, the act was little short of lunacy. Ballantrae seemed never to observe me; but at last, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> parching a little corn, he looked up.|$|R
60|$|I let him {{pray for}} a short time undisturbed, and then <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> suggest that we had better be pushing along one of the bears in our rear let out a roar that made the earth fairly tremble beneath our feet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Miles"--said Lucy, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> {{enter the}} house, she herself {{standing}} {{on the edge of}} the piazza on the point of following the party, but holding towards me the little paper box in which I had placed her portion of the pearls.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I say, Snob!' Wiggle here {{interrupted}} the excited bard (just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> break out into four lines so pathetic {{that they would}} drive you into hysterics). 'I say--ahem--couldn't you say that I was--a--military man, {{and that there was}} some danger of my life?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hardly," [...] {{returned}} Bulstrode, in {{the same}} deliberate, silvery tone; [...] "except by some changes of plan. The only person who may be certainly counted on as willing to increase her contributions <b>is</b> Mrs. Casaubon. <b>I</b> have had an interview {{with her on the}} subject, and I have pointed out to her, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>about</b> to do to you, that it will be desirable to win a more general support to the New Hospital by a change of system." [...] Another pause, but Lydgate did not speak.|$|R
6000|$|... "True, my lord," [...] said Richie, again {{waving his}} hand, {{as if to}} bespeak his master's silence and attention; [...] "so, I trust, you will think some time hereafter. And, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>about</b> to leave your service, it is proper that ye suld know the truth, that ye may {{consider}} the snares to which your youth and innocence may be exposed, when aulder and doucer heads are withdrawn from beside you.--There has been a lusty, good-looking kimmer, of some forty, or bygane, making mony speerings about you, my lord." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't, Adelaide. But, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> saying <b>about</b> the horses, when they're sold {{of course}} the bills won't go on. And I suppose things will come right. I don't owe so very much." ...|$|R
