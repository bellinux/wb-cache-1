40|$|Pot {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} Iran, to evaluate the effect of methanol on competition between rice (Oryza sativa) and barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli). The {{experiment was}} conducted as a randomized complete block design with a factorial treatment arrangement and three replicates. Factors were two aqueous methanol foliar applications (0, and 14 % v/v) and five rice: barnyardgrass ratios (100 : 0, 75 : 25, 50 : 50, 25 : 6, and 0 : 100). Replacement series diagrams for aboveground dry weight illustrated that 'Shiroudi' was more competitive than barnyardgrass as averaged across methanol foliar applications. When methanol was not sprayed, the lines for 'Shiroudi' and barnyardgrass intersected at 75 : 25 rice: barnyardgrass ratio, but when methanol was sprayed at 14 % v/v, the lines for 'Shiroudi' and barnyardgrass intersect at {{the left of the}} 75 : 25 rice: barnyardgrass mixture proportion. These indicate that methanol <b>application</b> <b>reduced</b> competitive ability of 'Shiroudi' against barnyardgrass for aboveground biomass accumulation.

40|$|AIM: To {{assess whether}} {{glutamate}} plays a similar role to glutamine in preserving gut wall integrity. METHODS: The effects of glutamine and glutamate on induced hyperpermeability in intestinal cell lines were studied. Paracellular hyperpermeability was induced in Caco 2. BBE and HT- 29 CL. 19 A cell lines by adding phorbol- 12, 13 -dibutyrate (PDB) apically, {{after which the}} effects of glutamine and glutamate on horseradish peroxidase (HRP) diffusion were studied. An inhibitor of glutamate transport (L-trans-pyrrolidine- 2, 4 -dicarboxylic acid: trans-PDC) and an irreversible blocker (acivicin) of the extracellular glutamine to glutamate converting enzyme, Î³-glutamyltransferase, were used. RESULTS: Apical to basolateral HRP flux increased significantly compared to controls not exposed to PDB (n = 30, P < 0. 001). Glutamine <b>application</b> <b>reduced</b> hyperpermeability by 19 % and 39 % in the respective cell lines. Glutamate <b>application</b> <b>reduced</b> hyperpermeability by 30 % and 20 %, respectively. Incubation of HT 29 CL. 19 A cells with acivicin and subsequent PDB and glutamine addition increased permeability levels. Incubation of Caco 2. BBE cells with trans-PDC followed by PDB and glutamate addition also resulted in high permeability levels. CONCLUSION: Apical glutamate -similar to glutamine- can decrease induced paracellular hyperpermeability. Extracellular conversion of glutamine to glutamate and subsequent uptake of glutamate could be a pivotal step in the mechanism underlying the protective effect of glutamine...|$|E

In agriculture, biodegradable plastics {{have been used}} as materials for plastic film in mulching treatment and plant pot. However, the effect of biodegradable plastics in soil on plant growth is yet to be clarified. Two experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of the degradable properties and concentration of biodegradable plastics in soil on plant growth and components of spinach. In experiment 1, 0. 05 %~ 1 % of a low degradable plastic (polylactide, L) or a high degradable plastic (caprolactam-polyester copolymer, C) was applied to the soil; the fresh weight; leaf number; shoot/root (S/R) ratio; and ascorbic acid, nitrate, and total or water-soluble oxalic acid contents of plants grown in treated soil were almost equal to those of the control.

40|$|Striga hermonthica {{infection}} poses a major constraint to sorghum {{production in}} sub-Saharan Africa, and low soil fertility aggravates the S. hermonthica problem. Under mineral nutrient deficiency, the sorghum host secretes {{large quantities of}} strigolactones, signalling molecules, into the rhizosphere. These induce S. hermonthica seed germination and subsequent infection of the host roots. In a combination of field and glasshouse experiments, we analysed the effect of microdose applied diammonium hydrogen phosphate (DAP) fertiliser on production of strigolactones, S. hermonthica infection and yield of three different African sorghum genotypes (CGM- 19 / 1 - 1, Lina- 3, DouaG). The sorghum cultivars all produced the strigolactones sorgomol and 5 -deoxystrigol, albeit in different quantity and ratio. Without fertiliser, high S. hermonthica infection and emergence occurred under both glasshouse and field conditions. DAP <b>application</b> <b>reduced</b> secretion of sorgomol and 5 -deoxystrigol and reduced S. hermonthica germination (66 â 70 %), emergence (49 â 73 %) and dry biomass (90 â 96 %) under glasshouse conditions.
