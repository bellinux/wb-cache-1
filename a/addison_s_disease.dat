40|$|Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal {{dystrophy}} (APECED, OMIM 240300) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal recessive}} disorder caused by mutations in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene located on chromosome 21 (21 q 22. 3). AIRE deficiency causes a loss in central immune tolerance, leading to the failure to eliminate autoreactive T cells in the thymus and allowing their escape to the periphery. Because of a founder effect, APECED is particularly prevalent in Finland (1 / 25, 000) but is observed worldwide with variable prevalence. APECED patients are susceptible to mucocutaneous candidiasis and multiple endocrine autoimmune diseases such as primary hypoparathyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, primary hypogonadism, type 1 diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypophysitis. They may also develop additional nonendocrine autoimmune diseases, such as alopecia areata/totalis, vitiligo, gastro-intestinal (GI) diseases, keratitis or tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN). In addition, the patients typically develop a variety of serum tissue-specific autoantibodies, which are predictive {{of the development of}} autoimmune disease and anticytokine antibodies such as those against type I interferons and Th 17 -related interleukin IL- 17 and IL- 22. The aim of this thesis was to study such manifestations of APECED that have not been well characterized before and also, to study health-related quality of life among Finnish APECED and Addison s disease/APS 2 patients. We evaluated the clinical GI features and searched for novel markers of GI dysfunction in a Finnish cohort of 31 APECED patients. The main upper GI symptoms were dysphagia and retrosternal pain (45 %) and the lower GI symptoms were constipation (48 %), diarrhoea (45 %) and malabsorption (16 %). Previously, L-amino-acid decarboxylase (AADC) and tryptophan hydroxylase type 1 (TPH- 1) antibodies have been demonstrated in APECED. AADC antibodies were found in 51 % and TPH- 1 antibodies in 39 % of all patients. Also, a T cell response to AADC was detected in 43 %. One third of the patients had autoimmune enteropathy (AIE) -related 75 kDa antigen (AIE- 75, 33 %) and villin (29 %) autoantibodies, and antibodies against brush borders and Paneth cells (PCs) were detected in 29 % and 20 %, respectively. Mucosal intestinal IL- 17 expression was decreased or negative in 77 % of the intestinal samples. Duodenal chromogranin A and serotonin expression was absent or decreased in 50 % and 66 % of the patients, respectively. Of the clinical symptoms, constipation correlated with negative serotonin staining (p less than 0. 05) and with AADC antibodies (p = 0. 019). Importantly, we found a correlation between autoantibodies against AADC, which are critical for serotonin and DOPA synthesis, and constipation. Constipation was also associated with a lack of serotonin expression in the enteroendocrine cells (EECs). Paneth cells (PCs) were lacking in the duodenum in 20 % of our intestinal samples, even though this was not associated with GI symptoms. In this Finnish APECED patient cohort, 17 % (5 / 30) had moderate-to-severe renal failure, including 10 % (3 / 30) with TIN requiring transplantation, haemodialysis or immunosuppressive treatment. However, the latter {{did not seem to be}} efficient in controlling disease progression. All 3 patients with TIN had circulating antibodies against the distal part of the nephron, as did 30 % of all cohort cases. The pathogenic relevance of such circulating antibodies is still unclear. The immunological basis of hypoparathyroidism in APECED was explored by studying circulating calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) and NALP 5 antibodies. Although they were detected in 16 of 44 (36 %) and 13 of 44 (30 %) patients, respectively, we failed to find any clinically relevant statistical association. These APECED patients did not present circulating antibodies for other autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease, bullous pemphigoid or pemphigus vulgaris. Some patients had antinuclear antibodies at a low-titre without clinical significance. Secondly, we evaluated the health-related quality of life among Finnish APECED and Addison s disease/APS 2 patients and sought to determine which factors may predict a possible impairment. Using health-related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaires for APECED (SF- 36) and Addison s disease/APS 2 patients (SF- 36, 15 D), we indeed observed impaired HRQoL. For the APECED patients, general health, emotional well-being and energy/vitality were the most diminished aspects of HRQoL. Among the patients with Addison s disease/APS 2, compared to a large control population, physical or emotional role functioning, energy/vitality and general health were most affected. Discomfort and symptoms, vitality, and sexual activity were the most affected dimensions of the 15 D scores. Affiliation with a patients association, female gender, the presence of non-APS 2 inflammatory comorbidities, lower educational level and a longer disease duration were independent predictors of impaired HRQoL in these patients. Taken together, the results of this thesis show that APECED patients are genetically prone to develop autoantibodies to a multitude of tissue antigens but are still tolerant to some common autoantigens. The true clinical and biological relevance of these circulating autoantibodies has not yet been elucidated, and it is possible that they are only a reflection of T cell-mediated immunity. They may, however, have a cumulative effect and clinical disease may arise only in patients with a combination of circulating antibodies, as seen in diabetes type 1. This may explain why we failed to find any association between any single type of antibody and a given symptom. For the lower GI track manifestations, we hypothesise a cumulative effect of the autoimmunity directed against both the enteroendocrine cells and the Paneth cells, leading to a dysfunction in both the secretion of serotonin in the gut and the secretion of antimicrobiobial defensins. Such a disturbance would have an effect on the gut microbiota. The question of whether the neutralising antibodies against cytokines may have a paradoxical protective effect is open to debate. Lastly, despite having a high number of manifestations, patients with APECED seem to cope with their disease. Patients with <b>Addison</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> have significantly impaired HRQoL compared to the general population. Autoimmuunipolyendokrinopatia-kandidiaasi-ektodermidystrofia (APECED, OMIM 240300) on harvinainen, autosomissa peittyvästi periytyvä sairaus, joka aiheutuu mutaatioista kromosomissa 21 (21 q 22. 3) sijaitsevassa autoimmune regulator (AIRE) geenissä. AIRE:n toiminnallinen puutos johtaa n. s keskusimmuunitoleranssin menetykseen siten että autoreaktiiviset T-solut eivät tuhoudu kateenkorvassa vaan pääsevät karkaamaan perifeeriseen verenkiertoon. APECED:in esiintyvyys Suomessa on erityisen korkea (1 / 25, 000) johtuen ns. perustaja-mutaatiosta AIRE-geenissä, mutta tautia tavataan myös muualla maailmassa vaihtelevalla esiintyvyydellä. APECED-potilaat ovat alttiita ihon ja limakalvojen krooniselle hiivatulehdukselle ja heillä voi esiintyä useita autoimmuunitauteja, kuten lisäkilpirauhasen, lisämunuaisen kuoren, kilpirauhasen sekä sukuelinten vajaatoimintaa, tyypin 1 diabetesta ja aivolisäkkeen tulehdusta. Näiden lisäksi APECED-potilaat kärsivät usein myös muista ei-endokriinisistä autoimmuunitaudeista kuten pälvikaljusta (alopesia), valkopälvestä (vitiligo), silmän sarveiskalvon tulehduksesta, munuaisputkien tulehduksesta (tubulointerstitiaalinen nefriitti, TIN),) sekä suoliston sairauksista. Potilailla havaitaan tyypillisesti seerumissa erilaisia kudos- ja elinspesifejä autovasta-aineita sekä vasta-aineita useita tulehdusvälittäjäaineita eli sytokiineja kohtaan. Viime mainitut kohdistuvat tavallisimmin tyypin I interferonia sekä Th 17 -immuunivasteeseen liittyviä interleukiineja IL- 17 ja IL- 22 kohtaan ja ennakoivat autoimmuunitaudin puhkeamista. Tässä väitöskirjassa on tutkittu tarkemmin kahta aiemmin huonosti tunnettua APECED:iin liittyvää oireistoa: ruoansuolatuskanavan sekä munuaisten ja virtsateiden oireita. Kyselytutkimuksen avulla kartoitimme potilaiden kokemat ruuansulatuskanavaperäiset oireet ja tutkimme suoliston toimintahäiriöiden tautimekanismia 31 suomalaista APECED-potilasta käsittävässä aineistossa. Tyypillisiä ylemmän ruoansulatuskanavan oireita olivat nielemishäiriöt ja rintalastan takainen kipu (45 %) ja alemman ruoansulatuskanavan osalta ummetus (48 %), ripuli (45 %) ja imeytymishäiriöt (16 %). Jo aiemmin on tiedetty APECED-potilailla esiintyvän vasta-aineita suoliston toiminnan kannalta keskeisten enteroendokriinisten (EE) solujen erittämiä entsyymejä tryptofaanihydroksylaasia (TPH- 1) ja aromaattista L-aminohappodekarboksylaasia (AADC) kohtaan. Potilasaineistossamme AADC-vasta-aineita esiintyi 51 %:lla sekä TPH- 1 vasta-aineita 39 %:lla potilaista. Uutena löydöksenä osoitimme T-soluperäisen immuunivasteen AADC:tä kohtaan 43 %:llä. Kolmasosalla potilaista oli osoitettavissa autovasta-aineita myös autoimmuuni enteropatiaan liittyvää antigeenia (AIE- 75) sekä ravinnon imeytymisestä vastaavien enterosyyttien mikrovilluksissa esiintyvää villiiniä vastaan. Lisäksi löysimme vasta-aineita suolen sukasaumaa (29 % potilaista) ja suolirauhasten Panethin soluja (20 % potilaista) vastaan. Suolen limakalvon IL- 17 :ää tuottavien solujen määrä oli alentunut tai puuttui 77 %:ssa tapauksista. Pohjukkaissuolen kromograniini-A-proteiinia tuottavien EE- solujen määrä oli vähentynyt tai puuttui 50 %:ssa ja vastaavasti serotoniinia tuottavien solujen määrä 66 %:ssa suolistonäytteistä. Potilaiden oireista ummetus korreloi negatiivisesti EE- solujen serotoniini-ilmentymisen (p alle 0. 05) sekä AADC-vasta-aineiden kanssa (p alle 0. 05). Huomionarvoista on, että havaitsimme merkittävän yhteyden ummetuksen ja serotoniini- ja dopamiinisynteesille keskeistä AADC-entsyymiä vastaan muodostuneiden vasta-aineiden välillä. Uusi havainto oli myös se, että suolistoon antimikrobisia defensiinejä tuottavat Panethin solut puuttuivat 20 %:ssa potilaiden duodenum-näytteistä, joskaan tämä ei suoraan korreloinut kliinisten oireiden kanssa. Tutkimistamme APECED- potilaista 17 % (5 / 30) kärsi keskivaikeasta tai vaikeasta munuaisen vajaatoiminnasta, ja 10 %:lla (3 / 30) potilaista oli TIN, joka vaati elinsiirteen, hemodialyysiä tai immunosuppressiivistä hoitoa. Näistä viime mainittu ei kuitenkaan osoittautunut riittäväksi taudinkulun hallinnoimisessa. Kaikilla kolmella TIN:istä kärsivällä potilaalla todettin verenkierrossa vasta-aineita nefronin distaalista osaa, munuaistiehyettä kohtaan. Samoja vasta-aineita löytyi kaikkiaan 30 %:lta aineistomme potilaista, mutta niiden merkitys TIN:in patogeneesissä on vielä tuntematon. Tutkimme myös APECED:issä esiintyvään lisäkilpirauhasen vajaatoimintaan liittyviä immunologisia taustamekanismeja määrittämällä verenkierrossa olevia kalsiumia tunnistavaa reseptoria (CaSR) ja NALP 5 -valkuaista kohtaan muodostuneiden vasta-aineiden määrän. Huolimatta siitä, että osoitimme vasta-aineita CaSR:ia vastaan 16 / 44 (36 %) potilaalla ja NALP 5 :ttä vastaan 13 / 44 (30 %) potilaalla, emme löytäneet kliinisesti relevanttia korrelaatiota. APECED-potilaillamme ei ollut veressään muussa väestössä tavallisten autoimmuunitautien kuten nivelreuman, keliakian, ihon autoimmuuni rakkulatautien (pemfigoidi ja pemfigus) vasta-aineita, mutta joillakin heistä oli matala-tiitterisiä tumavasta-aineita ilman niihin liittyviä kliinisiä muutoksia. Väitöskirjaan sisältyvät myös alkuperäistutkimukset potilaiden elämänlaadun kannalta keskeisistä tekijöistä ja terveyteen liittyvästä elämänlaadusta suomalaisilla APECED- ja Addisonin tauti/APS 2 potilailla. Käyttäessämme terveyteen liittyviä kyselytutkimuksia (SF- 36) APECED-potilailla sekä (SF- 36 sekä 15 D) Addisonin tauti/APS 2 -potilailla, kävi ilmi, että molempien potilasryhmien elämänlaatu oli alentunut. APECED-ryhmässä elämänlaatuun vaikuttivat negatiivisimmin heikentyneet yleinen terveydentila, henkinen hyvinvointi sekä energisyys/elinvoima. Addisonin tauti/APS 2 -potilailla elämänlaatuun negatiivisimmin vaikuttivat alentunut yleinen fyysinen ja emotionaalinen toiminta, terveydentila sekä energisyys/elinvoima. 15 D-kyselyn merkittävimmin muuttuneita tekijöitä olivat vaivat ja oireet, elinvoima sekä seksuaalinen aktiivisuus. Näiden potilaiden heikentyneeseen elämänlaatuun vaikuttivat eniten seuraavat erilliset tekijät: potilasyhdistykseen kuuluminen, naissukupuoli, muut kuin APS- 2 :een kuuluvat tulehdustaudit, alempi koulutustaso sekä pitkittynyt sairauden kesto. Tässä väitöskirjassa esitetyt tulokset osoittavat, että APECED-potilailla on runsaasti autovasta-aineita monia kudosantigeeneja vastaan mutta samalla potilaat ovat tolerantteja tietyille yleisille autoantigeeneille. Näiden kiertävien autovasta-aineiden lopullinen kliininen sekä biologinen merkitys on vielä tuntematon mutta on mahdollista, että ne ovat vain yksi T-soluvälitteisen immuniteetin osa-alue. On mahdollista, että näillä kiertävillä vasta-aineilla on kumulatiivinen vaikutus ja oireiden puhkeamiseen vaaditaan vasta-aineiden yhdistelmä, kuten on esimerkiksi tyypin 1 diabeteksessä. Tämä voisi selittää myös miksi yksittäisten vasta-aineiden ja kliinisten oireiden välillä ei tässä työssä aina voitu osoittaa merkitsevää assosiaatiota...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether dopaminergic dysfunction in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> was associated with impairments in functional connectivity across striatal subdivisions, which could potentially reflect reduced integration across corticostriatal circuits. Utilizing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we analyzed functional connectivity in 39 patients with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> both “on” and “off” their regular dopaminergic medications, along with 40 age-matched healthy controls.

The administration of dopaminergic medication significantly improved connectivity across striatal subdivisions in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> implicating dopaminergic deficits in the pathogenesis of impaired striatal interconnectivity. In addition, impaired striatal interconnectivity in the Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> “off” state was associated with pathological decoupling of the striatum from the thalamic and sensorimotor (SM) networks.

Biological therapy failed to control the disease, which responded to appropriate antibiotics for Whipple 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> Retrospectively, clinical symptoms before biological therapy were consistent with Whipple 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> All five patients had favorable outcomes (mean follow-up, 29  months [13 – 71]). Conclusions Biological therapy probably worsened preexisting Whipple 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> triggering the visceral disorders. Whipple 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> must be ruled out in patients with joint disease, as patients with this spontaneously fatal condition should not receive immunosuppressive agents...|$|R

Our objective is to determine utilization of SLNB in the surgical algorithm of Paget 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> Methods After institutional review board approval, a database review of patients with Paget 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> was conducted. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment including use of SLNB, and survival were reviewed. Patient characteristics and outcomes were analyzed by using contingency table chi-square, pooled t tests, and log-rank tests for comparisons.

Twelve Huntington 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> patients and sex- and age-matched controls performed a bimanual cranking task at two speeds (0. 5 Hz, 1. 5 Hz) and phase relationships (in-phase, anti-phase), with and without an external metronome cue. Data were sampled at 200 Hz, and raw displacement data for each hand, {{mean and standard deviation}} measures of the relative positions of the two hands and their velocities were then calculated. All participants could perform the in-phase movement, at both speeds; however, the Huntington 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> patients were more variable and less accurate than the control participants, particularly at the fast speed. While controls could perform the anti-phase movement, in which rotation of the cranks differed by 180 degrees at both speeds, Huntington 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> patients were unable to do so at either speed, reverting to the in-phase movement at the slow speed. An external metronome cue did not improve the performance of the Huntington 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> patients, which differentiated this group from patients suffering from Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> The Huntington 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> patients 2 ̆ 7 inability to perform the anti-phase movement may be due to damage to the basal ganglia and its output regions...|$|R

40|$|Our case of {{pigmented}} mammary Paget 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> simulated melanoma clinically and dermoscopically. Histologically, {{the lesion}} {{was characterized by}} microscopic features similar to those seen in malignant melanoma and, to a lesser extent, in Bowen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> (intra-epidermal squamous cell carcinoma). Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that the tumor cells were positive for keratins (Cam 5. 2 + MNF 116) and AE 1 -AE 3 and negative for HMB- 45 and S- 100 proteins. In conclusion clinical and dermoscopic examination cannot reliably distinguish melanoma from epithelial pre-neoplastic or neoplastic disease, therefore the differentiation of pigmented Paget 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> from superficial spreading of melanoma and Bowen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> is based on histopathologic integrated with immunohistochemical criteria...|$|R

The chromosomal location of this defective gene has been discovered by using genetic linkage to DNA markers on chromosome 21. The localization on chromosome 21 provides an explanation for the occurrence of Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease-like pathology in Down syndrome.

40|$|Behcet 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> is a multisystem {{disorder}} that presents with recurrent oral and genital ulcerations {{as well as}} ocular involvement. The etiology and pathogenesis of the disease remain obscure, however, neutrophil dysfunction {{is thought to be}} involved. Complement (C 5 a) is a potent neutrophils chemoattractant and is known to mediate many types of inflammatory responses. To elucidate the relationship between neutrophils and C 5 a in Behcet 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> the peripheral neutrophils of 31 patients with Behcet 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> and of 16 sex-age-matched normal controls were studied. Expression of C 5 a receptor mRNA was detected in Behcet 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> but not in the normal controls (p= 0. 045). Chemotaxis (p= 0. 011) and superoxide release (p= 0. 001) by Behcet 2 ̆ 7 s neutrophils was significantly higher than by normal neutrophils, and the intracellular calcium mobilization of Behcet 2 ̆ 7 s neutrophils was more active than that of normal neutrophils (p= 0. 004). Based on these results, we conclude that Beh cet 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> is associated with priming of peripheral neutrophils in vivo, suggesting that C 5 a {{may play a role in}} the etiology and pathogenesis of Behcet 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|R
40|$|Lexical-semantic and {{emotional}} processing deficits {{have been associated}} with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> This study investigated automatic and controlled lexical-semantic processing, the automatic activation of emotional evaluations, and the processing of words conveying negative and neutral emotional connotations in a combined affective and semantic priming paradigm. Eighteen participants with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> who had undergone surgery for deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) completed a lexical decision task at short and long stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs), during on and off stimulation conditions. Nineteen non-neurologically impaired participants acted as controls. The results indicated that automatic lexical-semantic {{and emotional}} evaluative processes are unimpaired in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> as reflected in the presence of comparable semantic and affective priming effects at the short SOA in on and off stimulation conditions compared with healthy controls. In contrast, participants with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> in the off stimulation condition showed a pattern of aberrant controlled lexical-semantic processing as evidenced by a lack of semantic priming effects at the long SOA condition. Controlled semantic priming was present, however, when the participants with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> were receiving stimulation of the STN, suggesting that STN stimulation modulates basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits involved in such processes. Finally, delayed reaction times for negatively valenced targets compared with neutrally valenced targets was evident in participants with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> in the on stimulation condition and control participants, but not for participants with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> in the off stimulation condition, suggesting that the incidental evaluation of negatively versus neutrally valenced words in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> is modulated by basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits...|$|R
40|$|Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> is {{characterized}} by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques. Although much is known about the molecular events leading to the formation of plaques and tangles as well as their relevance in neuronal cell loss associated with Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> the link between these two pathologies is presently unknown. The exact mechanism of neuronal cell death in the Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> brain has been a debated issue with both the necrosis and apoptosis pathways having been implicated. The activation of apoptosis in the Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> brain has recently gained momentum, namely because of the development of specific markers for caspase activation. These markers consist of antibodies, termed caspase-cleavage site-directed antibodies that are designed to detect either the active enzymatic fragments of caspases following their activation or protein products targeted for caspase cleavage. The use of these markers has demonstrated the widespread activation of caspases in the Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> brain. In addition, many of these markers have been co-localized with markers for neurofibrillary tangles, suggesting that caspases {{may play a role in}} the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and, thus, do not simply represent end-stage events associated with Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> In this review, recent studies documenting the role of caspases in the Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> brain will be discussed, along with the methodology behind the synthesis of site-directed caspase-cleavage antibodies. A model will be presented whereby caspases serve not simply as end-game players, but may actually serve as a link between senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. In this context, a discussion of the therapeutic value of targeting caspase inhibition in the treatment of Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> will be evaluated...|$|R

The presence of the APOE ϵ 4 allele correlated with lower total selenium levels in the temporal cortex and a higher concentration of soluble selenium. Additionally, we found that age significantly contributed to lower selenium concentrations in the peripheral membrane-bound and vesicular fractions.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to provide evidence to support the validity of the Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Disease</b> Behavior Scale - Nursing Home (ADBS-NH), a behavior based caregiver report designed to be sensitive and specific to Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Disease.</b> ^ Content validity was performed using a convenience panel of experts in geriatric psychiatry. Thirty persons were then recruited for each of the following known five groups: depressed, vascular dementia, mild Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Disease,</b> moderate to severe Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Disease,</b> and normal controls. The group assignments were determined by the Geriatric Depression Scale, Mini Mental State Examination and Hachinski scores. ^ It was then determined that the most appropriate cutoff score was 25 for this sample as this maximized the sensitivity and specificity. The study then analyzed the construct validity using oblique rotated factor analysis. The results deviated significantly from the expected dimensions that were agreed upon by the content experts. The derived factors named were based upon the items that loaded into each dimension. The dimension names were created using a common language, to make it user friendly to both health care professionals and non-professionals. ^ The concurrent validity of the ADBS-NH was then evaluated and found to be satisfactory. Convergent and discriminate validity was then analyzed. The ADBS-NH correlated poorly with the Hachinski Ischemic Scale and the Geriatric Depression Scale in all groups. It correlated well with the MMSE in both Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Disease</b> groups. These correlations prove that the ADBS-NH did not measure the same dimensions that the Hachinski Ischemic Scale and the Geriatric Depression Scale measured. The ADBS-NH did correlate well with the MMSE in Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Disease</b> groups, which was expected, as both instruments measured the cognitive deficits of Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Disease.</b> Internal consistency reliability was assessed using Cronbach 2 ̆ 7 s Alpha, which was acceptable at. 86.
