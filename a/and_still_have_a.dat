Josh Holloway, who {{plays the role of}} Sawyer, said, [...] "Just statistically speaking, to hit a hundred episodes doesn't happen very often, especially on a show where everyone is saying 'Lost on an island? What are you gonna do after a season or two?', so the fact that we've lasted not only a season or two but flourishing still at this time... it's shocking... it's amazing to me." [...] In an interview with The News & Observer, Lindelof recalled meeting with the ABC executives in 2004 to pitch the idea of a plane crash and survivors stranded on an island full of mystery and danger. When Lindelof was asked by the executives where the Lost saga would stand in the future, he replied, [...] "We're probably not going to get past episode thirteen. Let's all be honest about that up front." [...] Lindelof added that if he had [...] "traveled back in time to tell myself after that meeting {{that we were going to}} make it to a hundred <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> season beyond that, I would have laughed in my face." [...] The hundredth episode milestone was celebrated by the cast and crew on location in Oahu, Hawaii. Duff Goldman and his crew from the Food Network's American television show Ace of Cakes made a special Lost cake for the party to commemorate the milestone. The cake featured replicas of a Dharma beer bottles, the computer from the Swan station, a suitcase and a miniature Oceanic Flight 815. The Ace of Cakes episode ("LOST in Hawaii") featuring the making of the cake aired on the Food Network in the United States on May 9, 2009.|$|E
2500|$|Molten-salt-fueled {{reactors}} (MSRs) {{supply the}} nuclear fuel mixed into a molten salt. They {{should not be}} confused with designs that use a [...] molten salt for cooling only (fluoride high-temperature reactors, FHRs) <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> solid fuel. Molten salt reactors, as a class, include both burners and breeders in fast or thermal spectra, using fluoride or chloride salt-based fuels and a range of fissile or fertile consumables. LFTRs are defined by the use of fluoride fuel salts and the breeding of thorium into uranium-233 in the thermal spectrum.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} solo {{instrument}} is the prima, which is tuned E4–E4–A4 (thus the two lower strings are {{tuned to the}} same pitch). Sometimes the balalaika is tuned [...] "guitar style" [...] by folk musicians to G3–B3–D4 (mimicking the three highest strings of the Russian guitar), whereby {{it is easier to}} play for Russian guitar players, although classically trained balalaika purists avoid this tuning. It can also be tuned to E4–A4–D5, like its cousin, the domra, {{to make it easier for}} those trained on the domra to play the instrument, <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> balalaika sound. The folk (pre-Andreev) tuning D4–F4–A4 was very popular, as this makes it easier to play certain riffs.|$|E

2500|$|On January 4, 2011, Billboard {{revealed}} two guest {{appearances on}} Fiasco's album Lasers. The guests confirmed were Trey Songz and British rapper Sway. In {{the interview with}} Billboard, Fiasco expressed his thoughts on music piracy and fighting track leaks on various blogs. Speaking about the problems with his record label, Fiasco has stated: [...] "I think I set the precedent for record labels — showed everyone {{that you can have}} rappers that don't fit the format <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> presence [...] You look at a person like me, or Kanye , and {{it was sort of a}} shock to the system. I definitely think I was part of changing that, and an influence to a lot dudes that are coming out today." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{the pilots}} of the British Royal Flying Corps and Royal Naval Air Service arrived in France in 1914 they found {{themselves}} equipped with pusher types too underpowered to carry machine guns <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> chance of overtaking the enemy, and tractor types which were difficult to arm for the aggressive pursuit of enemy aircraft because the propeller was in the way. Among other attempts to get around this (such as firing obliquely past the arc of the propeller, and even efforts, doomed to failure, to synchronize the Lewis Gun which {{was at the time}} the [...] "standard" [...] British aircraft weapon) was the expedient of firing straight through the propeller arc and [...] "hoping for the best". A high proportion of bullets would in the normal course pass the propeller without striking the blades, and each blade might typically take several hits before there was much danger of its failing, especially if it was bound with tape to prevent splintering (see diagram below, and illustration to the left).|$|E
2500|$|Newington Green fell {{within the}} old parish {{boundaries}} of Stoke Newington. Although the latter village, centred on Church Street, was {{a mile away}} from the hamlet of the Green, across farmland or along the ancient drovers' road of Green Lanes, the two places had <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> close connection. From the mid-1640s to the mid-1650s, Stoke Newington's parish church was led by Thomas Manton, [...] "a principal person among the non-conformist ministers",; a staunch and popular defender of Reformed principles, he participated in the Westminster Assembly, acted as chaplain to Oliver Cromwell, and preached before Parliament on several occasions. Another Dissenting meeting house was built in Stoke Newington about 1700, near the house of Mary Abney, who had inherited the manor. Later that century the village became known for its Quaker inhabitants; their meeting house was designed by the architect William Alderson. In 1858 the medieval parish church of St Mary was supplemented by an impressive Victorian Gothic building opposite, by Sir George Gilbert Scott. In addition to the buildings, Stoke Newington was remarkable for its range of social reforms, from its connections to the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade to {{the foundation of the}} innovative Newington Academy for Girls.|$|E

2500|$|Though {{school feeding}} {{produces}} {{a variety of}} anticipated impacts, as mentioned above, much research and evaluation {{is being done to}} determine the results of school feeding programs in low-income countries. School feeding program results are often context-specific, but lessons from a variety of communities can help evaluate school feeding program effectiveness. Researchers at the International Food Policy Research Institute have critically assessed evidence from developing countries to define preliminary results of these programs. [...] These assessments found that the timing of meals is not a critical factor in the positive effects on learning and cognition, and thus take-home rations can perform as well as in-school meals, and that in-school meals may even disrupt learning. [...] In some settings, take-home rations are more cost-effective than in-school meals, and the study argued that some country programs may be optimized by focusing resources on take-home rations. Additionally, it was found that in the study setting, school attendance improved learning more significantly than nutrition status improvements, but that school feeding programs encouraged attendance <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> positive net result on education levels. In a study done by Patrick J. McEwan, it was shown that {{there is no evidence that}} higher-calorie meals positively impact school enrollment and attendance, first-grade enrollment age and grade repetition, and fourth-grade test scores over average-calorie school feeding meals in Chile's national program. [...] Thus, McEwan's study suggested that Chilean policy, to produce significant positive results, should focus more on the nutritional composition of school meals, rather than caloric content alone.|$|E

60|$|There {{are various}} {{stories of the}} pair having met at dinner almost {{on the eve of}} Danton's arrest, and parting with sombre disquietude on both sides. The interview, with its champagne, its interlocutors, its play of {{sinister}} repartee, may possibly have taken place, but the alleged details are plainly apocryphal. After all, 'Religion ist in der Thiere Trieb,' says Wallenstein; 'the very savage drinks not with the victim, into whose breast he means to plunge a sword.' Danton was warned that Robespierre was plotting his arrest. 'If I thought he had the bare idea,' said Danton with something of Gargantuan hyperbole, 'I would eat his bowels out.' Such was the disdain with which the 'giant of the mighty bone and bold emprise' thought of our meagre-hearted pedant. The truth is that in the stormy and distracted times of politics, and perhaps in all times, contempt is a dangerous luxury. A man may be a very poor creature, <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> faculty for mischief. And Robespierre had this faculty in the case of Danton. With singular baseness, he handed over to Saint Just a collection of notes, to serve as material for the indictment which Saint Just was to present to the Convention. They comprised everything that suspicion could interpret malignantly, from the most conspicuous acts of Danton's public life, down to the casual freedom of private discourse.|$|E
