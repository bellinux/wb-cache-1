40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a passive-blind scheme for {{detecting}} forged images. The scheme leverages quantization table estimation {{to measure the}} inconsistency among images. To improve {{the accuracy of the}} estimation process, each AC DCT coefficient is first classified into a specific type; then the corresponding quantization step size is measured adaptively from its energy density spectrum (EDS) and the EDS's Fourier transform. The proposed content-adaptive quantization table estimation scheme is comprised of three phases: pre-screening, candidate region selection, and tampered region identification. In the pre-screening phase, we determine whether an input image has been JPEG compressed, and count the number of quantization steps whose size is equal to one. To select candidate regions for estimating the quantization table, we devise <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>region</b> selection algorithm based on seed region generation and region growing. First, the seed region generation operation finds a suitable region by removing suspect regions, after which the selected seed region is merged with other suitable regions to form <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>region.</b> To avoid merging suspect regions, <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>region</b> refinement operation is performed in the region growing step. After estimating the quantization table from the candidate region, an maximum-likelihood-ratio classifier exploits the inconsistency of the quantization table to identify tampered regions block by block. To evaluate the scheme's performance in terms of tampering detection, three common forgery techniques, copy-paste tampering, inpainting, and composite tampering, are used. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can estimate quantization tables and identify tampered regions effectively...|$|E

40|$|Probabilistic {{forecasts}} {{can capture}} uncertainty better and provide significant economic benefits because the {{users of the}} information can calibrate risk. For forecasts in earth-centered domains to be useful, the forecasts have to be clearly demarcated in space and time. We discuss {{the characteristics of a}} good probability forecast – reliability and sharpness – and describe well-understood techniques of generating good probability forecasts in the literature. We then describe our approach to addressing the problem of creating good probabilistic forecasts when the entity to be forecast can move and morph. In this paper, we apply the technique to severe weather prediction by formulating the weather prediction problem to be one of estimating the probability of an event at a particular spatial location within a given time window. The technique involves clustering Doppler radar-derived fields such as low-level shear and reflectivity to form candidate regions. Assuming stationarity, the spatial probability distribution of the regions is estimated, conditioned based on the level of organization within the regions and combined with the probability that <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>region</b> becomes severe.

Several fine-mapping {{studies have}} highlighted <b>a</b> 300 -kb <b>candidate</b> <b>region</b> of PSORS 1 where multiple biologically plausible candidate genes were suggested. The most recent study has indicated HLA-Cw 6 as the primary PSORS 1 risk allele within the <b>candidate</b> <b>region</b> in <b>a</b> Caucasian population. In this study, a family-based association analysis of the PSORS 1 locus was performed by analyzing 10 polymorphic microsatellite markers from the PSORS 1 region as well as HLA-B, HLA-C and CDSN loci in 163 Chinese families of psoriasis. Five marker loci show strong evidence (P, 10 23), and one marker locus shows weak evidence (P = 0. 04) for association. The haplotype cluster analysis showed that all the risk haplotypes are Cw 6 positive and share a 369 -kb region of homologous marker alleles which carries all the risk alleles, including HLA-Cw 6 and CDSN*TTC, identified in this study. The recombinant haplotype analysis of the HLA-Cw 6 and CDSN*TTC alleles in 228 Chinese families showed that the HLA-Cw 6 2 / CDSN*TTC + recombinant haplotype is clearly not associated with risk for psoriasis (T:NT = 29 : 57, p = 0. 0025) in a Chinese population, suggesting that the CDSN*TTC allele itself does not confer risk without {{the presence of the}} HLA-Cw 6 allele.
