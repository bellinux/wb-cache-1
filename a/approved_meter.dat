50|$|Gas meters are {{required}} to register the volume of gas consumed within an acceptable degree of accuracy. Any significant error in the registered volume can represent a loss to the gas supplier, or the consumer being overbilled. The accuracy is generally laid down in statute for the location in which the meter is installed. Statutory provisions should also specify a procedure to be followed should the accuracy be disputed. In the UK, the permitted error for a gas meter manufactured prior to the European Measuring Instruments Directive is ±2%. However, the European Measuring Instrument Directive has harmonised gas meter errors across Europe and consequently meters manufactured since the directive came into force must read within ±3%. Meters whose accuracy is disputed by the customer have to be removed for testing by an <b>approved</b> <b>meter</b> examiner. If the meter {{is found to be}} reading outside of the prescribed limits, the supplier has to refund the consumer for gas incorrectly measured while that consumer had that meter (but not vice versa). If the meter cannot be tested or its reading is unreliable, the consumer and supplier have to negotiate a settlement. If the meter is found to be reading within limits, the consumer has to pay the costs of testing (and pay any outstanding charges). This contrasts with the position on electric meters, where the test is free and a refund is only given if the date of the meter started reading inaccurately can be determined.|$|E
50|$|By mid-July 2013, {{the first}} Smart Meter In-Home Displays {{were being made}} {{available}} to Victorian consumers. At the beginning of 2014 there were three <b>approved</b> Smart <b>Meter</b> In-Home Displays directly available to consumers.|$|R
50|$|NTi Audio, Svantek, Cirrus Research plc, Casella, 3M, Brüel & Kjær and Rion {{are a few}} {{of global}} players in this Industry that provide a {{complete}} range of fully pattern <b>approved</b> sound level <b>meters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Even {{the most}} {{accurate}} <b>approved</b> sound level <b>meter</b> must be regularly checked for sensitivity—what most people loosely call 'calibration'. The procedures for periodic testing are defined within IEC61672.3-2013. To ensure accuracy in periodic testing, procedures should {{be carried out by}} a facility that can produce results traceable to International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation, or other local International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation signatories.|$|R
40|$|The {{government}} <b>approved</b> the Advanced <b>Metering</b> Infrastructure (AMI) {{project in}} February 2006. A large and complex project, {{it aims to}} record and measure electricity use in more detail than current meters allow. Between 2009 and 2013 the AMI project will replace accumulation meters in 2. 4 million homes and small businesses with smart meters. This audit assessed whether the advice and recommendations provided to government on the roll-out of AMI have been sound...|$|R
50|$|As of today, the Supreme Court of India has {{suspended}} the drive. The new plan envisions a mixed land use policy by which {{commercial and residential}} use can be simultaneous. However, the sealing drive in Delhi {{is very much in}} progress. Shops and establishments which were registered by Municipal Corporation of Delhi under 24 specified categories were made to pay various charges though most of them have commercial electricity meters and some have <b>approved</b> commercial water <b>meters.</b> Almost all the shops had VAT registration and the owners were paying income tax through income from these shops. So all the shops which are running from residential areas and were not found on notified roads are being forcibly shut down.|$|R
5000|$|In 1902, Arthur Pitney {{patented}} {{his first}} [...] "double-locking" [...] hand-cranked postage-stamping machine, and, with patent attorney Eugene A. Rummler, founded the Pitney Postal Machine Company. In 1908, English emigrant {{and founder of}} the Universal Stamping Machine Company Walter Bowes began providing stamp-canceling machines to the United States Postal Service. Bowes moved his operations to Stamford in 1917. A rapid increase in mail volume in 1919 made the Post Office more receptive to metered mail, and Pitney subsequently traveled to meet Bowes. On March 15, 1920, the United States House of Representatives passed a bill authorizing mechanical stamps on First-Class Mail, and on April 23, 1920, the two companies merged to form the Pitney Bowes Postage Meter Company, with the goal of producing a machine that would combine Pitney's [...] "double-locking" [...] counter with Bowes' system for wrapping postage payment, postmarking and cancellation. The United States Post Office <b>approved</b> their postage <b>meter</b> on August 25, 1920.|$|R
40|$|The {{scientific}} {{issues concerning}} {{the relationship between}} electromagnetic fields and adverse health effects are very complex and difficult to interpret. Epidemiologic data are limited and many results to date are based on small studies with methodological limitations. As a result, there are large differences {{in the way that}} these studies are evaluated and interpreted, both within the scientific community in general, and among scientists and Agencies within the federal governments and utilities bodies. This paper contains studies of electromagnetic fields around 138 kV and 230 kV transmission lines and the practical solutions to the field reduction predicted by computer simulation. Chosen were transmission lines 1 and 2 of 138 kV and 230 kV where the data was collected near areas that may be of concern to human occupants. Line 1 consists of two transmission lines of three phase lines. Data was collected with EMDEX II gauss <b>meter</b> <b>approved</b> by EPRI. Analysis of initial measurements was done and compared with simulated data using Southern California Edison's FIELDS program. Feasibility of three new rephasing configurations are evaluated based on the magnitude of magnetic field reduction, the economics, and the practicality. At th...|$|R
5000|$|Hong Lam Marine {{was founded}} in 1981 by Lim Teck Cheng, the current Chief Executive, {{together}} with his father. Business began with two wooden barges chartered to Esso Singapore, which transported fuel within the Singapore port. In the same year, Esso Singapore awarded two more contracts to Hong Lam Marine. Hong Lam Marine expanded their fleet with the purchase of two steel bunker tankers from Japan. These were then modified to meet the local regulations for operating in the Port of Singapore. In 1989, the company started building single-hull ships of 4,000 - 6,000 DWT. [...] In 2005, Hong Lam Marine ventured into the building of double-hull vessels. In 2007, the company went on to form a joint-venture company with the Japanese trading house, Toyota Tsusho, to build and own two 22,000 DWT tankers, SPECTRUM and SPLENDOUR. These two world’s largest purpose-built bunker tankers were delivered in 2009. Hong Lam Marine works closely with the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) to implement green shipping practices. The company commissioned a series of 10 diesel-electric bunkering vessels, which were delivered between 2011 and 2013. They are also the first company in Singapore to use MPA <b>approved</b> mass flow <b>meters</b> on its vessels for bunker delivery. According to Mr Lim, these mass flow meters “can supply 15 to 20% more fuel” for their vessels and also save up to 3 hours per bunker delivery. The company is also involved in a Joint Industry Project (JIP) to investigate the operational feasibility of liquefied natural gas (LNG) bunkering in Singapore in collaboration with 22 industry partners. Currently, the use of LNG in Singapore is hindered by the high operating costs required to purchase and transport it, {{as well as a}} lack of demand for it.|$|R
