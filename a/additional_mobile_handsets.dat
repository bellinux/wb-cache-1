So, it is imperative to study the existing challenges that facing the <b>mobile</b> <b>handsets</b> threat containment process, and the different techniques and methodologies that used to face those challenges and contain the <b>mobile</b> <b>handsets</b> malwares. This paper also presents a new approach to group the different malware containment systems according to their typologies...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{economic}} theory predicts that tying {{can serve as}} a tool for leveraging market power. In line with this {{economic theory}}, competition authorities regulate the tying of Microsoft Windows with its Media Player or Internet browser in the EU and Japan. The authorities also take note of the market power of <b>mobile</b> <b>handset</b> operating systems (OSs) over competition in the app and services markets. However, no empirical evidence has thus far been presented on the success of government intervention in the Microsoft case. To assess the effectiveness of government intervention on <b>mobile</b> <b>handset</b> OSs, we identify the extent to which complementarity and consumer preferences affect the correlation between <b>mobile</b> <b>handset</b> OSs and <b>mobile</b> service app markets (mail, search, and map). We find significant positive complementarity between the mail, search, and map services, and <b>mobile</b> <b>handset</b> OSs. However, the elasticities of the <b>mobile</b> <b>handset</b> OS 2 ̆ 013 mobile service correlations are rather small. We conclude that taking action to restrict <b>mobile</b> <b>handset</b> OSs is less effective than acting on mobile services market directly...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent times}} the {{different}} {{features of the}} <b>mobile</b> <b>handsets</b> have led to great modernization in mobile phone development. All <b>mobile</b> <b>handset</b> companies have added numerous features in their different brands. Manufacturers also try to set apart from their own products by implementing supplementary functions to formulate them more striking to the consumers. This study analyzes the features of <b>mobile</b> <b>handsets</b> affecting buying decision of consumers in tertiary student segment. In this study, sixteen diverse features of <b>mobile</b> <b>handsets</b> have identified under five factors. The {{purposes of this study}} are to find out the effect of specific features, to explore relationship between purchase decision and features and to estimate variation in purchase decision for various features through the consumers. Data has been collected from randomly selected 80 respondents from the students of the Comilla University, Bangladesh. In this case the collected data have been analyzed by using statistical devices. Results suggest that internet facility, multimedia, long lasting battery, camera, brand recognition, performance and color of <b>mobile</b> <b>handset</b> mostly persuade purchasing decision and external memory capacities, warranty period, price, customer-care service, phone memory capacities, country of origin have some influence over purchase decision. It is expected that the findings will be useful to improve our understanding about the features of <b>mobile</b> <b>handset.</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>handset</b> manufacturers also will grasp idea for innovating features for their brands...|$|R
40|$|Within 20 years, the <b>mobile</b> <b>handset</b> {{has evolved}} from the basic phone merely capable of voice calling to the {{advanced}} smartphone, which combines voice communication with multiple other functionalities. <b>Mobile</b> <b>handset</b> components, or features, along with evolving communications infrastructure, enable a smartphone to run numerous mobile applications and services. Therefore, mobile operators, application developers, service providers, and regulators are increasingly interested in the information on <b>mobile</b> <b>handset</b> feature diffusion for making effective managerial and investment decisions. This paper quantitatively studies dependences between <b>mobile</b> <b>handset</b> features, which need to be analyzed for understanding and estimating future feature diffusion. The study {{is based on an}} extensive dataset on <b>mobile</b> <b>handset</b> sales in Finland and utilizes a method of hierarchical clustering for identifying the sets of dependent features. The results show that the features became increasingly dependent in 2008 - 2014. Although the nature of feature dependences differs, on a general level, they arise from <b>mobile</b> <b>handset</b> design decisions made by the device producers. The factors influencing these design decisions and consequently feature dependences can be divided in four main groups: technology, demand, product strategy, standardization and regulatory factors...|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} methodologies that allow a <b>mobile</b> <b>handset</b> to be {{integrated}} into a VoIP network. One implementation turns the mobile device into a standard SIP client, which then uses a data network to send and receive SIP messaging, and to send and receive RTP for the voice path. This methodology of turning a <b>mobile</b> <b>handset</b> into a standard SIP client requires that the <b>mobile</b> <b>handset</b> support, at minimum, high speed IP communications. In this application, standard VoIP protocols (typically SIP) are used over any broadband IP-capable wireless network connection such as EVDO rev A (which is symmetrical high speed — both high speed up and down), HSPA, Wi-Fi or WiMAX.|$|R

40|$|This paper assesses radio {{frequency}} exposure of a <b>mobile</b> <b>handset</b> user {{in the context}} of a new class of cellular base station: the femtocell. Traditional cellular network construction relies on using a single base station to cover a large area and serve dozens to hundreds of users. The femtocell (named after the minuscule size of the coverage area) provides a low-power in-home cellular connection for the <b>mobile</b> <b>handset.</b> Consequently, we expect it to behave differently to a macrocell in terms of the users {{radio frequency}} energy exposure. Our work focuses on the trade-off in incident power on the <b>mobile</b> <b>handset</b> user when connected to either a macrocell or femtocell using power loss and power control models. Contrary to many individuals initial feeling that putting a base station in your home would increase exposure, our findings indicate that having a femtocell in the home will actual reduce the <b>mobile</b> <b>handset</b> users exposure to radio frequency energy.

40|$|A {{miniaturized}} antenna {{becomes an}} important component of a <b>mobile</b> <b>handset.</b> However, it is difficult to design the miniaturized antenna, because the antenna characteristics in a <b>mobile</b> <b>handset</b> depend on the radiation effect through metal chassis. So the properties of an antenna and that of chassis radiation have to be estimated precisely. Here, we present effective methods to miniaturize a dielectric resonator antenna, and show a clue and a guideline of techniques to miniaturize an antenna in consideration of radiation through the chassis of a <b>mobile</b> <b>handset.</b> Furthermore, we talk about the properties of two types of miniaturized ceramics resonator antennas, which are developed by us. We also describe their radiation characteristics in the talking position, in case of the antennas placed on metal chassis of handsets. To miniaturize these two dielectric antennas, the design methods of patch antennas resonated at the quarter wavelength or half wavelength are applied, respectively. Advantage of ceramic, which has high permittivity as antenna material, is described, using new evaluation parameter for the miniaturized antenna in a <b>mobile</b> <b>handset.</b> As compared with a conventional Planer Inverted-F Antenna (PIFA), these miniaturized resonator antennas bring about an improvement of antenna efficiency in the talking position, for the <b>mobile</b> <b>handset</b> operating at 1. 5 GHz band...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims at {{a better}} {{understanding}} of the mechanisms of mobile network service evolution through a closer examination of the context of <b>mobile</b> <b>handsets.</b> It aims first to establish quantitatively that <b>mobile</b> <b>handsets</b> are a determinant of mobile network service evolution patterns, and second, to develop a consistent perspective capable of explaining the evolution of various mobile network services. Despite the fact that <b>mobile</b> <b>handsets</b> are indispensable to users of mobile network services, surprisingly little is known about the role of these <b>handsets</b> in <b>mobile</b> network service evolution. This paper provides quantitative evidence of a positive relationship between intra-network-carrier penetration rates for mobile network service subscribers and <b>mobile</b> <b>handsets</b> designed for these services. The relationship is such that if one network service is diffused more than another, the <b>mobile</b> <b>handsets</b> related to the more diffused service are similarly more widely diffused in the market, and vice versa. The evidence is derived from an analysis of two mobile network services in Japan, mobile Internet and third generation mobile, initiated by NTT DoCoMo and KDDI. There are no existing studies that consistently explain the mechanisms of different mobile network service evolution patterns. Since the positive relationship that emerges from the analysis is consistent for both cases, by examining the mechanisms underlying this relationship, the paper develops an adequate and consistent perspective based on a constituent model reflecting the technological and competition structure of mobile network services. From this perspective, this positive relationship can be explained as the similarity or dissimilarity in essential technology ownership distribution across constituents. This perspective describes mobile network evolution in terms of changes in the distribution of essential technology ownership and, therefore, could be generalised more widely.
