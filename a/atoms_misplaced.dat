Here we first unambiguously confirm that solid-state 1 H NMR at fast (60 - 65 kHz) magic-angle spinning (MAS) can be used to distinguish and quantify the different local Mg nAl 3 -nOH (n = 1, 2, and 3) environments of hydroxyl groups in LDH layers. By combining different solid-state 1 H and 27 Al one- and two-dimensional NMR measurements with first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that, although globally ordered, the cation distribution in Al-rich Mg/Al- 2 LDHs contains detectable amounts of Al clustering. Though small, the fraction of Al <b>atoms</b> <b>misplaced</b> with respect to the perfectly ordered cation arrangement (where Al-Al pairs are avoided) could be quantified. Their number is shown to counterbalance the number of misplaced Mg atoms for a Mg/Al ratio of 2 and to strongly decrease for reduced Al contents. This establishes that, although not favored, Al-O-Al linkages are not excluded in Al-richer LDH materials, a finding that will strongly impact our understanding of the local acidity of these materials and their widely exploited anion exchange and reconstruction properties. © 2011 American Chemical Society...|$|E
50|$|Despite {{decades of}} research, {{scientists}} are still inconclusive {{as to the}} source of red color in diamonds. It is believed that the same cause of the pink color in pink diamonds is the origin of red color as well, but in a more concentrated dose. The most commonly accepted theory is that during the diamond’s formation, a plastic deformation is caused in the crystal lattice structure. Some of the <b>atoms</b> are <b>misplaced</b> as the diamond moves up through its kimberlite deposit, and the intense pressure of this movement causes the varying shades of pink, or red, to appear. This lends credence to the hypothesis that red diamonds are in fact extremely dark pink diamonds, and why only one color intensity is possible. It is possible for red diamonds to be modified by the same secondary colors that can be found modifying pink diamonds as well.|$|R

We indicate here in particular that the number densities and sizes of precritical SiOx clusters in as-grown wafers, as estimated by elementary means, {{should be possible to}} quantify with modern techniques, provided that challenges associated with surface noise and thickness estimation can be overcome...|$|R
