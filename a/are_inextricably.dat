5|$|Soul Reaver 2 {{is set in}} Nosgoth, {{a fictional}} land with fantasy aspects. In the first game in the series, , the vampire Kain embarks on a journey to restore the Pillars of Nosgoth—nine supernatural edifices which <b>are</b> <b>inextricably</b> tied {{to the health of}} the land, but become corrupted. During his adventure, Moebius, a {{manipulative}} sorcerer, tricks Kain into orchestrating the destruction of the vampire race: Kain is left the last surviving vampire in Nosgoth. After restoring eight of the Pillars, Kain discovers that he would need to sacrifice his own life to restore the final corrupt one. Realizing that his death would ensure the annihilation of his species, he refuses to kill himself. This triggers the Pillars' collapse, and dooms the world to eternal decay, but enables Kain to live on and revive the vampire race.|$|E
5|$|Water {{security}} and food security <b>are</b> <b>inextricably</b> linked. In the decade 1951–60 human water withdrawals were four {{times greater than}} the previous decade. This rapid increase resulted from scientific and technological developments impacting through the economy—especially the increase in irrigated land, growth in industrial and power sectors, and intensive dam construction on all continents. This altered the water cycle of rivers and lakes, affected their water quality and {{had a significant impact on}} the global water cycle. Currently towards 35% of human water use is unsustainable, drawing on diminishing aquifers and reducing the flows of major rivers: this percentage is likely to increase if climate change impacts become more severe, populations increase, aquifers become progressively depleted and supplies become polluted and unsanitary. From 1961 to 2001 water demand doubled—agricultural use increased by 75%, industrial use by more than 200%, and domestic use more than 400%. In the 1990s it was estimated that humans were using 40–50% of the globally available freshwater in the approximate proportion of 70% for agriculture, 22% for industry, and 8% for domestic purposes with total use progressively increasing.|$|E

25|$|The Catholic Church understands {{human beings}} to consist of body and mind, the {{physical}} and the non-physical (or soul perhaps), and that the two <b>are</b> <b>inextricably</b> linked. Humans are capable of discerning the difference {{between good and evil}} because they have a conscience. There are many manifestations of the good that we can pursue. Some, like procreation, are common to other animals, while others, like the pursuit of truth, are inclinations peculiar to the capacities of human beings.|$|E
25|$|Phase 4 - Endonormative stabilization: This {{stage is}} {{characterized}} by the gradual acceptance of local norms, supported by a new locally rooted linguistic self-confidence. By this time political events {{have made it clear that}} the settler and indigenous strands <b>are</b> <b>inextricably</b> bound in a sense of nationhood independent of Britain. Acceptance of local English(es) expresses this new identity. National dictionaries are enthusiastically supported, at least for new lexis (and not always for localized grammar). Literary creativity in local English begins to flourish.|$|E
25|$|A Business Process Management {{system is}} quite {{different}} from BPA. However, it is possible to build automation {{on the back of a}} BPM implementation. The actual tools to achieve this vary, from writing custom application code to using specialist BPA tools, as described above. The advantages and disadvantages of this approach <b>are</b> <b>inextricably</b> linked – the BPM implementation provides an architecture for all processes in the business to be mapped, but this in itself delays the automation of individual processes and so benefits may be lost in the meantime.|$|E

25|$|It is {{now widely}} {{accepted}} that vascular remodelling in the embryo {{is a process}} distinct from vasculogenesis; however these two processes <b>are</b> <b>inextricably</b> linked. Vasculogenesis occurs prior to vascular remodelling, but is a necessary step {{in the development of}} the blood vessel network and has implications on the identification of vessels as either arterial or venous. Once contraction of the heart begins, vascular remodelling progresses via the interplay of forces resulting from biomechanical cues and fluid dynamics, which are translated by mechanotransduction to changes at cellular and genetic levels.|$|E
25|$|A 2008 {{settlement}} over pollution fines by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection led {{the state}} of New York to create a $7million fund for projects that would tangibly benefit the community affected by the pollution with a priority given to projects relating to the environment. NBBC proposed building {{one of the largest}} boathouses in the city along the shores of the Newtown Creek. The project aimed to enhance the community’s open space, educational and recreational facilities and improve the perception of the Newtown Creek. The idea was that awareness and stewardship <b>are</b> <b>inextricably</b> linked so a boathouse would best connect people to the waterways.|$|E
25|$|As sex {{and gender}} <b>are</b> <b>inextricably</b> linked in day-to-day life, their union is {{apparent}} in medicine. Gender and sex are both components of health disparity in the male population. In non-Western regions, males {{tend to have a}} health advantage over women due to gender discrimination, evidenced by infanticide, early marriage, and domestic abuse for females. In most regions of the world, the mortality rate is higher for adult men than for adult women; for example, adult men suffer from fatal illnesses with more frequency than females. The leading causes of the higher male death rate are accidents, injuries, violence, and cardiovascular diseases. In a number of countries, males also face a heightened risk of mortality as a result of behavior and greater propensity for violence.|$|E

25|$|These {{principles}} of reason, cause and substance, given thus psychologically, {{enable us to}} pass {{beyond the limits of}} the relative and subjective to objective and absolute reality, they enable us, in a word, to pass from psychology, or the science of knowledge, to ontology or the science of being. These laws <b>are</b> <b>inextricably</b> mixed in consciousness with the data of volition and sensation, with free activity and fatal action or impression, and they guide us in rising to a personal being, a self or free cause, and to an impersonal reality, a not-me—nature, the world of force—lying out of us, and modifying us. As I refer to myself the act of attention and volition, so I cannot but refer the sensation to some cause, necessarily other than myself, that is, to an external cause, whose existence is as certain for me as my own existence, since the phenomenon which suggests it to me is as certain as the phenomenon which had suggested my reality, and both are given in each other. I thus reach an objective impersonal world of forces which corresponds to the variety of my sensations. The relation of these forces or causes to each other is the order of the universe.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} argued that the play's themes of duplicity and ambivalence <b>are</b> <b>inextricably</b> bound up with Wilde's homosexuality, and that the play {{exhibits}} a [...] "flickering presence-absence of… homosexual desire". On re-reading the play after his release from prison, Wilde said: [...] "It was extraordinary reading the play over. How I used to toy with that Tiger Life." [...] As one scholar has put it, the absolute necessity for homosexuals of the period to [...] "need a public mask is a factor contributing to the satire on social disguise." ...|$|E
500|$|Henrik Queitsch of Ekstra Bladet {{praised the}} action {{sequences}} for its details, even {{saying it is}} the best Danish war film ever and said it is also [...] "a booming interesting history and a multifaceted psychological portrait– not only of Flame and Citron, but also of the many people they come across in their path". Kim Skotte of Politiken said it had more gunfire than psychology and that it lacked a more detailed explanation of the characters' backgrounds that would justify their personalities. Writing for Jyllands-Posten, Johs. H. Christensen wrote that there [...] "never occurs any real connection, no excitement, no interaction, no common destiny between Flame and Citron, although they <b>are</b> <b>inextricably</b> linked most of the time".|$|E

500|$|Suresh Krishnamoorthy of The Hindu called Businessman a [...] "wholesome package" [...] and a [...] "pure entertainer", quoting [...] "Puri Jagannath {{has proved}} that he's still the {{director}} with the Midas {{touch with his}} latest release, Businessman". Y. Sunita Chowdary, also from The Hindu, wrote [...] "The Businessman has a mix of action, image, dialogue and montage but what makes it entertaining {{is that all the}} above quantities <b>are</b> <b>inextricably</b> bound and linked together at every level with an admirably tight script." [...] She added that Jagannadh did not make any structural, technical or content errors, although the story was a regular one. Suresh Kavirayani of The Times of India gave the film 3.25 out of 5 stars and called the film an [...] "unpretentious entertainer that manages to strike the right balance", which according to him, had enough in it to keep the viewers interested till the end despite not being a spectacular production.|$|E
500|$|While this {{administrative}} structure was decreed {{by a government}} anxious to deal with [...] interlocutors, such a restructuring has not taken place in Casamance. Jola society is devoid of any formal hierarchy. It has no leader with genuine permanent authority. Instead, there are village elders who meet when important decisions need to be made. According to Italian anthropologist Paolo Palmeri, {{the leader of the}} village has very little power in reality, as he is merely responsible for relations with the national administration. He simply allows the village to continue practicing its traditions. In a society where politics <b>are</b> <b>inextricably</b> linked to religion, the real holders of power are the fetish priests. The very notion of a village is almost inappropriate in this context: it might be more appropriately considered a clan or an aggregation of kinship. Other specialists, such as Christian Sina Diatta, compare Jola communities to those of mound-building termites, in which each member performs a specific function and where the queen is easily replaceable.|$|E
500|$|A {{distributed}} element filter is {{an electronic}} filter in which capacitance, inductance and resistance (the {{elements of the}} circuit) are not localised in discrete capacitors, inductors and resistors {{as they are in}} conventional filters. Its purpose is to allow a range of signal frequencies to pass, but to block others. Conventional filters are constructed from inductors and capacitors, and the circuits so built are described by the lumped element model, which considers each element to be [...] "lumped together" [...] at one place. That model is conceptually simple, but it becomes increasingly unreliable as the frequency of the signal increases, or equivalently as the wavelength decreases. The distributed element model applies at all frequencies, and is used in transmission line theory; many distributed element components are made of short lengths of transmission line. In the distributed view of circuits, the elements are distributed along the length of conductors and <b>are</b> <b>inextricably</b> mixed together. The filter design is usually concerned only with inductance and capacitance, but because of this mixing of elements they cannot be treated as separate [...] "lumped" [...] capacitors and inductors. There is no precise frequency above which distributed element filters must be used but they are especially associated with the microwave band (wavelength less than one metre).|$|E

2500|$|Despite these similarities, the {{relationship}} with development {{is one of the}} most contested areas of human security [...] [...] "Freedom from fear" [...] advocates, such as Andrew Mack, argue that human security should focus on the achievable goals of decreasing individual vulnerability to violent conflict, rather than broadly defined goals of economic and social development. Others, such as Tadjbakhsh and Chenoy, argue that human development and human security <b>are</b> <b>inextricably</b> linked since progress in one enhances the chances of progress in another while failure in one increases risk of failure of another.|$|E
