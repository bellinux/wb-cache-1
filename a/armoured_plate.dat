5|$|T-26 mod. 1939 in the Parola Tank Museum, (Finland): the Finnish war-time {{modernization}} (Finnish tactical number Ps164–7); a hull from a KhT-133 flame-throwing {{tank with}} a mounted turret from the T-26 mod. 1938/1939 and a ball mount for the DT tank machine gun in a hull front <b>armoured</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E
5|$|T-26 mod. 1939 in the Kubinka Tank Museum, Moscow Oblast (Russia): this {{tank with}} pressed turret front <b>armoured</b> <b>plate</b> is in {{drivable}} condition (the GAZ-41 engine from the BRDM-2 {{was installed in}} 2005). The tank has combat damage taken during the Great Patriotic War (many marks from armour-piercing bullets and a welded hole {{on the right side}} of the turret from a 50mm shell).|$|E
5000|$|When {{implemented}} at the IFOR/SFOR {{forces in}} the former Yugoslavia, 6 M113A2s were retrofitted with [...] "add-on armour". The body is protected with the FMC <b>armoured</b> <b>plates,</b> [...] "spall liner" [...] and [...] "belly armour", the fuel-tanks are filled with [...] "safety foam balls" [...] and the turret with a Danish kit consisting of ceramic and <b>armoured</b> <b>plates</b> developed by E. Falck Schmidt and Roulund in Odense. The M113A2 can resist fire from weapons up to 14.5 mm at a range down to 100 m.|$|R

5000|$|In 2011, David Cameron {{took the}} {{delivery}} of another XJ Sentinel featuring [...] "bomb proof" [...] doors, bullet proof glass and <b>armoured</b> <b>plating</b> beneath {{the floor of the}} car, respectively replacing the previous XJ Sentinel.|$|R
5|$|Macrae, Ismay and Churchill all saw fit {{to record}} these {{arguments}} over the technical issue of stickiness. As Eden had pointed out, {{there was a}} lot at stake. The British infantry and Home Guard had little with which to put up a fight against tanks and to any who had witnessed trials of Molotov Cocktails and SIP grenades it was evident that they could do little to a modern tank other than to provide a blinding pall of smoke. What was needed was a hand weapon to deliver a coup de grâce by punching through the <b>armoured</b> <b>plate.</b> The sticky bomb could do the job and little else was available.|$|E
25|$|The Finns modernized their T-26s in 1942–1943. Eight T-26 mod. 1931 tanks {{received}} turrets {{from the}} single-turreted T-26 or BT tanks. Additionally, turrets from irreparable T-26s or BTs of different models were mounted on KhT-26s, KhT-130s and KhT-133s, which had flame-throwing equipment removed. A ball mount for the DT tank machine gun was installed {{on some of}} these tanks in the front <b>armoured</b> <b>plate</b> of the underturret box. In addition, some Finnish T-26s had a modified driver's hatch opened to the left as well as a different kit of spare parts tools, and many tanks were equipped with a special rear beam for towing guns and damaged vehicles.|$|E
500|$|T-26 {{with the}} A-43 turret: {{artillery}} T-26 or [...] "tank of fire support" [...] with a turret developed by self-taught inventor N. Dyrenkov at the Experimental Design Office of the Department of Mechanization and Motorization of the RKKA (UMM RKKA). Two types of turrets, {{armed with the}} 76mm regimental gun mod. 1927 and DT tank machine gun in a ball mount, were assembled by the Izhora Factory. They were partially pressed and welded. The first variety was installed on the T-26 mod. 1931 in February 1932 and the second type was used in November 1932 (in the last case, the rear <b>armoured</b> <b>plate</b> of underturret box was made sloping).|$|E
50|$|The {{main and}} the two small machine gun turrets of the Т-35 and Т-28 had {{a high level of}} standardization. Main-weapon {{sighting}} utilized the telescopic breech-sight TOP obr.1930 and the periscope breech-sight PT-1 обр.1932. The 76.2mm cannon had 96 rounds, the 45mm guns had 226 rounds, and the DT machine guns had 10,080 cartridges. The 50-ton tank was designed with the maximum thickness of the body's <b>armoured</b> <b>plates</b> being 30mm and that of the turret 20mm. The <b>armoured</b> <b>plates</b> were coupled together by welding and riveting. In 1936, the thickness of the frontal, sloping body plate and the front plate protecting the driver-mechanic was increased to 50mm. Armored side skirts also added 10mm to the side armor covering the tracks.|$|R
25|$|Additional <b>armoured</b> <b>plates</b> can be {{installed}} on the vehicle to increase protection. Active protection methods can also be used, such as explosive reactive armour. These can be added over the existing armour of the vehicle. To increase protection, periscopes are installed instead of windscreens and vision blocks.|$|R
50|$|The first {{modification}} was a new, {{more powerful}} powertrain. The new design could use either the Saurer CT1D diesel engine (license-produced in Poland as PZInż 155) or a modern gasoline engine PZInż 725. Both engines were lighter and {{smaller than the}} Saurer VBLDd engine used in 7TP. Because of that the armour could be extended and more space could be redirected to the battle compartment. An additional bonus {{was the fact that}} both engines were water-cooled which allowed for the rear grille of 7TP to be replaced with solid <b>armoured</b> <b>plates.</b> Another modification planned for the 9TP was switching from bolted and screwed to welded <b>armoured</b> <b>plates,</b> which further strengthened the hull and allowed to save additional 210 kilograms, enough to further strengthen the armour and widen the tracks from 267 mm to 320 mm.|$|R
500|$|Since {{at least}} 1938, Jefferis had been {{toying with the}} idea of a {{demolition}} or anti-tank weapon that would be ideal for irregular warfare. It would work by having an explosive charge deform so that it had a substantial area of intimate contact with the surface of the target. Then, when detonated, the effect of the explosion would be focused on a small area and would rupture an <b>armoured</b> <b>plate</b> much thicker than would otherwise be the case. Sappers call such a device a [...] "poultice" [...] or [...] "squash head" [...] charge. Jefferis enlisted Drs Bauer and Schulman of the Colloid Science Department of Cambridge University, they experimented with lengths of bicycle inner tube filled with plasticine to represent the explosive. These were fitted with wooden handles and dipped in rubber solution to make them sticky. In experiments, these prototypes proved difficult to aim and only by chance did any stick to the metal bins used to represent tanks.|$|E
500|$|The turrets were {{designed}} to mount the 8.8 cm KwK 43 L/71 gun. Combined with the Turmzielfernrohr 9d (German [...] "turret telescopic sight") monocular sight by Leitz, which {{all but a few}} early Tiger IIs used, it was a very accurate and deadly weapon. During practice, the estimated probability of a first round hit on a [...] high, [...] wide target only dropped below 100 percent at ranges beyond , to 95–97 percent at [...] and 85–87 percent at , depending on ammunition type. Recorded combat performance was lower, but still over 80 percent at 1,000m, in the 60s at 1,500m and the 40s at 2,000m. Penetration of <b>armoured</b> <b>plate</b> inclined at 30 degrees was [...] at [...] and [...] respectively for the Panzergranate 39/43 projectile (PzGr—armour-piercing shell), and [...] for the PzGr. 40/43 projectile between the same ranges. The Sprenggranate 43 (SpGr) high-explosive round was available for soft targets, or the Hohlgranate or Hohlgeschoss 39 (HlGr—HEAT or High-explosive anti-tank warhead) round, which had [...] penetration at any range, {{could be used as a}} dual-purpose munition against soft or armoured targets.|$|E
5000|$|A protectoscope is {{a similar}} {{periscopic}} vision device {{designed to provide a}} window in <b>armoured</b> <b>plate,</b> similar to a direct vision slit. A compact periscope allows the vision slit to be blanked off with <b>armoured</b> <b>plate,</b> preventing an ingress point for small arms fire, with only a small difference in vision height.|$|E

5|$|Hulls of twin-turreted T-26s were {{assembled}} using <b>armoured</b> <b>plates</b> {{riveted to}} a frame from metal angles. Some tanks, produced in 1931, had sealing zinc shims at the hull bottom between <b>armoured</b> <b>plates</b> for fording water obstacles. After problems with rain entering the engine compartment, a special cover was installed over an air outlet window after March 1932. Some T-26s produced {{at the end}} of 1932–1933 had a riveted and welded hull. The T-26 mod. 1931 had two cylindrical turrets mounted on ball bearings; each turret turned independently through 240°. Both turrets could provide common fire in front and rear arcs of fire (100° each). The disadvantage of such a configuration was that not all of the tank's firepower could be used at once on the same side. Four turret modifications existed, and they were mounted on tanks in different combinations (for instance, a tank with a riveted hull could have riveted and welded turrets).|$|R

50|$|German {{industry}} could not deliver as many steel armour plates as were {{needed for the}} mounting of weapons in the bunkers. The armour-plated sections were designed to include the embrasures and their shutters as well as armoured cupolas for 360° defence. Germany depended on other countries to provide the alloys required in producing <b>armoured</b> <b>plates</b> (mostly nickel and molybdenum), so either the armour plates were left out or they were produced with low-quality replacement materials.|$|R
50|$|Despite this {{relationship}} to crocodiles, Ornithosuchus {{was able to}} walk on its hind legs, like many dinosaurs. However, it probably spent most of its time on all fours, only moving bipedally when it needed to run rapidly. Its skull also resembled those of theropod dinosaurs, but more primitive features included the presence of five toes on each foot and a double row of <b>armoured</b> <b>plates</b> along the animal's back. Ornithosuchus was around 4 m in length.|$|R
50|$|The Spitfire, {{from about}} mid-1940, had 73 pounds (33 kg) of {{armoured}} steel plating {{in the form}} of head (of 6.5 mm thickness) and back protection on the seat bulkhead (4.5 mm), and covering the forward face of the glycol header tank. The Hurricane had a similar armour layout to the Spitfire, and was the toughest and most durable of the three. Serviceability rates of Hawker's fighter were always higher than the complex and advanced Spitfire.The Messerschmitt Bf 109 E-3 received extra armour in late 1939, and this was supplemented with a 10 mm thick <b>armoured</b> <b>plate</b> behind the pilot's head during and after the Battle of France. Behind the fuel tank, an 8 mm <b>armoured</b> <b>plate</b> was placed in the fuselage protecting the tank and the pilot from attacks from behind.|$|E
