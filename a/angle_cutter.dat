40|$|Calculation of the {{swept volume}} of a cutter {{is the heart}} of any {{numerical}} controlled (NC) simulation system. In NC machining, a wide variety of cutter shapes are used such as flat end mills, dome end mills, ball nose end mills, <b>angle</b> <b>cutters,</b> face mills and side-and-face cutters. There are also many types of cutter paths along which the cutter is guided by the NC controller: rapid motion, linear motion and circular motion are the most commonly used cutter paths among them.

40|$|Purse-seining is {{regarded}} as one of the most effective methods for capturing migrating pelagic schools (Ben-Yami, 1994; Watson et al., 2006), where the school is encircled and entrapped by the net, pumped aboard into the cargo hold, then delivered to the coast for processing. For avoiding increased mortality during slipping of unwanted catch (Lockwood et al., 1983; Huse & Vold, 2010; Tenningen et al., 2012), the fishermen need reliable information on the school’s total biomass, density and species before shooting the purse-seine. Migrating pelagic fish schools, such as the Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) and the Norwegian spring spawning herring (Clupea harengus L.), often swim near the sea surface. Therefore, the vertical echosounder may perform poorly if much of the population is within this near-surface blind zone, or if the fish move to avoid the vessel (Misund, 1993 b; Ona et al., 2007 b; Hjellvik et al., 2008; Totland et al., 2009). Then, calibrated, horizontally-observing tools are needed if this portion of the population is to be quantified. Schooling fish can be detected and observed remotely using multi-beam sonars, such as the Kongsberg Maritime Simrad SX 90 (Simrad, 2007) or the Furuno FSV- 30 used in Nishimori et al. (2009). In standard operation, the sonar transmits a conical acoustic beam through the entire water volume around the fishing vessel (Brehmer et al., 2006). During reception, 64 acoustical beams are formed through array processing techniques applied to the transducer element outputs (Blomberg et al., 2012). Calibration of the accessible beams is a necessity if an accurate quantitative measures are required (Aglen, 1994). A precise calibration rig was designed to move the target with adequate control to map a single beam in detail (Paper 1). The initial rig was unsatisfactory as its size and weight limited its capacity to calibrate multiple sonar beams. A second rig was therefore designed for swifter movement of the target through multiple beams from each rig-mounting location. Within-beam target-tracking algorithms were then a prerequisite. The theory behind realizations of both a Split-Beam algorithm and an Interpolated Neighbouring Beam algorithm was described for the cylindrical transducer array with 256 circular elements (Paper 2) where the Split-Beam algorithm facilitated target positioning with precision between ± 0. 2 and ± 0. 25 º. In a practical field calibration, the reference target was steered to the centre of each accessible beam, or to cross the beam horizontally and vertically, guided by the Split-Beam positioning (Paper 3). Multiple calibration trials have shown accuracy around ± 0. 5 dB is to be expected in what {{is regarded}} as a typical field calibration environment. Still, this accuracy was found to be susceptible to rapid but small variations of both the salinity and temperature of the stratified water, where a 0. 8 dB drop of the measured sphere target strength has been seen. A further improvement of the calibration accuracy does not, however, contribute any significance reduction of the total uncertainty when finally computing the school’s biomass. The volume of a single school is estimated by evaluating its three measured extensions, the length, width and height. The two across-beams extensions, width and height, were seen to be overestimated due to the border effects created by the finite beam width, an effect also reported for echosounders (Diner, 2001). In paper 4, this effect was investigated on several simulated schools of known sizes, where two across-beam smearing effects were identified as the Long Range Smearing and Short Range Smearing effects. Correction of both effects increased the accuracy, giving precisions for the volume estimate between 6. 6 - 8. 7 % for the width and 8. 5 - 10. 5 % for the height. The mean estimated volume of a real school of herring was reduced by 55 % by correcting for the smearing effects. When converting the received acoustic energy into a quantitative biomass measure, the backscattered is divided by a mean backscattering cross-section representative of the species and individual-fish size. For horizontal acoustic transmissions, finding a representative backscattering cross-section is complicated since the cross-section is not only dependent on the distribution of the pitch and roll angles (Nakken & Olsen, 1977), the depth (Ona, 2003) or length of fish (Foote, 1980 b), but also the yaw <b>angle</b> (<b>Cutter</b> & Demer, 2007). Circumnavigating the school is proposed as a means of increasing the accuracy of the volume density, where only school data from favourable incidence angles are used, for example close to the broadside of the school. If both low-frequency and a high-frequency fishery sonar are available, a comparison of the frequency response may give an indication of the actual angle of incidence. Such Dual-Frequency analysis may contribute to a more accurate volume density in situations where a full circumnavigation is not possible. This synthesis represents only part of the total work conducted in one of the working package in the CRISP project, intended to provide the skipper accurate and reliable information on the school biomass during the last stages of an inspection. </p...|$|E

40|$|High speed {{machining}} {{was developed}} over {{sixty years ago}} and at present is still limited {{to just a few}} materials, these being aluminium and its alloys, hardened steels for the mould and die industry and titanium for aerospace applications. Recently there has been additional work in high speed machining on some of the more exotic aerospace alloys such as inconel and nimonic alloys. This thesis addresses the problems encountered when machining high chromium/nickel steel alloys {{that are part of the}} stainless steel family. Three grades of stainless steel were selected for this purpose, these being a martensitic grade (416) and two austenitic grades (303 & 316). These materials were high speed milled at cuttinspeeds of up to 3, 000 m min- 1, via the use of two machining methodologies; high torque-low speed and low torque-high speed milling. High torque-low speed milling was accomplished through the use of specially designed large diameter dual-plane balanced face mills, that when rotated at 6, 000 rev mon- 1 generated a cuting speed of 3, 000 m min- 1. These cutters were capable of machining three grades of stainless steel at approximately ten times that of the cutting speeds normally selected for materials that are cut conventionally. However, at the elevated cutting speeds machining of the two austenitic grades of stainless steel exhibited high tool wear rates which contributed to both poor surface finish and high cutting forces. The lo torque-high speed machining of these stainless steel grades was undertaken via specifically designed variable axial rake <b>angle</b> <b>cutters</b> in conjunction with a gear-driven speed increaser. This head gave a maxiumum cutting speed of 750 m min- 1 when the cutters were rotated at 20, 000 rev min- 1. Experiments indicated that the three grades of stainless steel could be machined at high rotational speeds, with good surface finish produced with negative axial rake angled tools. This machining strategy caused tool 'ironing' of the machined surface. cutting forces were lower at all cutting speeds when a positive axial rake angled tool was employed, although at elevated cutting speeds tool wear was excessive regardless of any axia rake angle geometry...|$|R
40|$|AbstractChatter-free cutting {{parameter}} selection {{is a very}} important topic in milling process. Thus, numerous researches have been done to predict the stability lobes of milling process. Practical milling process is always influenced by multiple modes and cutter runout which may induce multiple delays.

Especially, combined effect of multiple modes and cutter runout makes stability analysis more difficult. To this end, this paper aims at revealing the influence of cutter runout on milling stability when multiple modes occur. Numerical and experimental studies are carried out to study this issue.

To fulfill the requirements of accuracy and tool life needs not only well planning of cutting path but also the proper cutting conditions of cutters. The vibration and deflection of cutters caused by poor selection of cutting conditions can be predicted using models of cutting force and tool deflection. In this paper, a cutting force model considering the effect of tool helical angle and a cantilever beam model of tool deflection were proposed for the high speed machining of hard-to-cut material SKD 11. The shearing force, the plowing forces, and the helical <b>angle</b> of <b>cutters</b> are considered in the elemental force model.

40|$|An {{investigation}} was conducted as a preliminary {{effort to develop}} a methodology to predict pore pressure in a rock formation during drilling, {{for all types of}} rocks and situations. Specifically, it was investigated whether or not the virgin pore pressure (the pore pressure of the undisturbed rock) can be determined at the drill bit from drilling and environmental parameters, as well as solid and pore fluid properties. Several drilling situations were analyzed to develop models relating pore pressure to drilling and environmental parameters, as well as solid and pore fluid properties. Three approaches to the modeling of such drilling situations were considered, which were used to predict pore pressure and compare the predictions to actual drilling data. The first approach used the concept of the effective stress in conjunction to the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion. The second approach used the concept of the mechanical specific energy. The third approach made use of basic principles to relating virgin pore pressure to drilling and environmental parameters, as well as solid and pore fluid properties. This third approach resulted in the proposal of a more fundamental way of viewing mechanical specific energy (MSE) and the use of Biot's poroelasticity theory to describe the cutting process of rock. The first approach did not provide an adequate prediction of virgin pore pressure for all types of rocks and situations. The second approach showed promising results with limited actual drilling data. A sensitivity analysis of the model resulting from the third approach indicated that pore pressure, type of rock, and back rake <b>angle</b> of the <b>cutter</b> are the most significant factors affecting the energy required to break the rock. Moreover, rate of cutting stress, depth of cut, and type of pore fluid become significant factors of the cutting process only when a low-porosity, low-permeability rock is considered. It was concluded that there exists a relationship among pore pressure, drilling and environmental parameters, as well as solid and pore fluid properties. Therefore, it is possible in principle to determine the virgin pore pressure at the drill bit from drilling parameters, environmental parameters, and material properties. However, further work is required to establish a quantitative relationship among the significant parameters before a methodology to predict virgin pore pressure for all types of rocks and situations can be developed...|$|R
50|$|The grab {{has to be}} {{selected}} so that the combined weight of grab and contents does not exceed the grabbing safe working load of the crane. The mass of the contents depends upon {{the properties of the}} product being handled; its density, flow characteristics, angle of repose, lump/grain size, purity (e.g. is it wet or dry) and, in some cases, degree of settlement (e.g. a ship's cargo has compacted due to vibration, rolling, pitching and yawing over a long voyage). Most bulk-handling cranes are dedicated to a single product, but others will handle various materials and need a selection of grabs. Some applications (e.g. manganese ore) may also require the use of teeth fitted to the grab jaws to enable penetration. Other applications (e.g. rape seed) may require to be self-sealing and have offset lower jaws with serrated, <b>angle</b> cut side <b>cutters</b> to restrain easy-flow properties.When off-loading a ship, the grab may be more efficient if designed with a low-profile extended body which enables reaching under the ship's hatches, negating any need to centre the product with human and machinery access.The grab mechanism may be four rope, double rope, single rope ring discharge, single rope self-dumping, double chain, single chain self-dumping, single chain ring discharge, hydraulic or electro-hydraulic.Rope grabs have rope pulleys in both the upper and lower girders and close by drawing the closing rope(s) to shorten the gap between the two girders. The minimum diameter of the pulley is restricted by the ratio of the pulley diameter to the rope diameter, the strands of the wire rope being subjected to fatigue bending stresses if the pulley is too small, giving premature failure. The physical size of the pulleys then determines the size of the girders, then determining a break point between a four rope and a two rope design. The closing force at the shell jaws, and, inversely, the speed of closure, are determined by the number of pulleys on each closing rope in the two girders. The closing rope is fed into the grab mechanism through either a bellmouth or an arrangement of small rollers. The weight of the grab is supported by the holding rope(s) and pinned to the upper girder allowing some angular freedom. Holding and closing ropes require separate winding drums in the crane.The mechanism on chain grabs operates {{in the same way as}} on rope grabs. The chains are connected to ropes on the crane by (e.g. bordeaux) couplings which allow rotation. A linked chain requires a much small diameter pulley than the equivalent rope which makes a smaller, more compact, design of girder. Chains used on chain pulleys are less easily inspected for wear and fatigue than ropes which show outer strand deformation well before failure. Failure of a rope or chain is a very high severity (dangerous) hazard.|$|R
