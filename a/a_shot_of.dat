5|$|John Blutarsky – In a final {{voice-over}} <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> the White House, Landis {{remarks that}} the viewers {{all know what}} happened to Bluto and Mandy Pepperidge: they became the President of the United States and First Lady of the United States.|$|E

5|$|Actors and props from Doppelgänger would re-appear {{in a later}} Anderson TV series, UFO. Although the Andersons {{incorporated}} adult themes {{into their}} script {{in an effort to}} distinguish the film from their children's TV productions, cuts to more mature content, in this case <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> a pack of contraceptive pills, were required to permit an A and, later, PG certificate from the BBFC.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{the whole}} video set {{is made in}} {{tropical}} and romantic setting. The video begins with <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> Rihanna herself laying down in grass. Then scenes of Rihanna walking {{on the beach and}} Rihanna curling up on the chair are shown. This is followed by her own and her partner holding each other closely in bed, sitting on different sides of a large bed, and other scenes featuring Rihanna singing through sheer curtains and drapery. In the video there are also black-white scenes showing Rihanna touching to a stone wall.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} three seasons, between Tony leaving the tunnel and passing through the toll plaza, the show had <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> the World Trade Center towers in Tony's {{rear-view}} mirror. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, this shot was removed and replaced with a more generic shot, beginning with the show's fourth season.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the only}} episode not to begin with <b>an</b> {{exterior}} <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> the hotel. Instead, <b>an</b> exterior <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> the Northwick Park Hospital in Brent was used.|$|R

The {{cover of the}} Fifth Column 7 [...] " [...] single, [...] "All Women Are Bitches", features <b>a</b> still <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> Anita Smith from the film, and the flipside, [...] "Donna", features <b>a</b> still <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> Donna Dresch from the film.|$|R
50|$|The US and English Canadian VHS {{releases}} are cut. Edited {{from the}} film was <b>an</b> additional <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> Lep on top of Diane as he attempts to rape her, <b>a</b> more graphic <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> Diane slashing Runt's throat, and <b>a</b> longer <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> Stanley burning to death. However, both the French Canadian and Spanish VHS versions were released uncut.|$|R
5|$|Internationally, Hitchcock {{was forced}} to make {{minor changes to the}} film, mostly to the shower scene. In Britain, the BBFC {{requested}} cuts to stabbing sounds and visible nude shots, and in New Zealand the shot of Norman washing blood from his hands was objected to. In Singapore, though the shower scene was left untouched, the murder of Arbogast, and <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> Norman's mother's corpse were removed.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{indicate}} that executive producer Steve Jobs lacked {{confidence in the}} film during its production, {{and he had been}} talking to various companies, ranging from Hallmark to Microsoft, about selling Pixar. However, as the film progressed, Jobs became ever more excited about it, feeling that he might {{be on the verge of}} transforming the movie industry. As scenes from the movie were finished, he watched them repeatedly and had friends come by his home to share his new passion. Jobs decided that the release of Toy Story that November would be the occasion to take Pixar public. A test audience near Anaheim in late July 1995 indicated the need for last-minute tweaks, which added further pressure to the already frenetic final weeks. Response cards from the audience were encouraging, but were not top of the scale, adding further question as to how audiences would respond. The film ended with <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> Andy's house and the sound of a new puppy. Michael Eisner, who attended the screening, told Lasseter afterward that the film needed to end with <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> Woody and Buzz together, reacting to the news of the puppy.|$|E
5|$|The closing titles use a {{different}} arrangement of the theme, sung by countertenor Jeremy Jackman, with lyrics (usually insulting Blackadder) that reflect {{the events of the}} preceding episode. The song is played over <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> Blackadder strolling through a formal garden and being annoyed by the lute-wielding minstrel (Tony Aitken). This sequence was incorporated as a separate subplot, with Blackadder constantly attempting to apprehend the musician each time with limited success. At the end of the final episode, Blackadder catches the minstrel and repeatedly dunks him in a fountain.|$|E
50|$|The single's artwork {{used the}} same photo of Parr as on the Running the Endless Mile cover, but zoomed in for <b>a</b> closer <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> his face. The Japanese cover used <b>a</b> wide <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> similar {{photograph}} taken during the same shoot as the album's photo.|$|R

5|$|A Canadian mutant {{and future}} X-Men member and often {{referred}} as Jimmy by Victor Creed. Jackman, who played Wolverine {{in the previous}} films, has also become producer of the film via his company Seed Productions, and earned $25million for the film. Jackman underwent a high intensity weight training regimen to improve his physique for the role. He altered the program to shock his body into change and also performed cardiovascular workouts. Jackman noted no digital touches were applied to his physique in <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> him rising from the tank within which Wolverine has his bones infused with adamantium.|$|E
5|$|Abandoned {{by their}} father {{deep in a}} forest, young Hansel and Gretel enter a {{gingerbread}} house and are captured by a cannibalistic witch. The witch forces Hansel to continuously eat candy to fatten him up, and enslaves Gretel by ordering her to prepare the oven. The siblings outsmart her and incinerate her in the fire of the oven. In the fifteen years that follow, Hansel and Gretel become famed witch hunters, slaying hundreds of witches. The pair find that they are somehow immune to spells and curses, but the incident in the gingerbread house has left Hansel diabetic. He needs <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> insulin every few hours or he will get sick and die.|$|E
5|$|After the Simpsons {{arrive at}} home, the camera cuts to <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> {{them on the}} couch, then zooms out to show this as a picture {{hanging on the wall}} of a fictional {{overseas}} Asian animation and merchandise sweatshop. The animation color quickly becomes drab and gray, and the music turns dramatic à la Schindler's List. A large group of tired and sickly artists draw animation cels for The Simpsons among piles of human bones and toxic waste, and a female artist hands a barefoot child employee an animation cel, which he washes in a vat of biohazardous fluid.|$|E

5|$|An initial {{photo shoot}} with the band's long-time {{photographer}} Anton Corbijn was done near U2's Berlin hotel in late 1990. Most {{of the photos}} were black-and-white, and the group felt they were not indicative {{of the spirit of}} the new album. They re-commissioned Corbijn for an additional two-week photo shoot in Tenerife in February 1991, for which they dressed up and mingled with the crowds of the annual Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, presenting a more playful side of themselves. It was during the group's time in Tenerife and during a four-day shoot in Morocco in July that they were photographed in drag. Additional photos were taken in Dublin in June, including <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> a naked Clayton. The images were intended to confound expectations of U2, and their full colour contrasted with the monochromatic imagery on past sleeves.|$|E
5|$|For {{the battle}} {{sequence}} in North Africa, two actual Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawks in Desert Air Force paint schemes were used, accompanied by cloned images {{of them or}} by computer-generated planes. In scenes showing squadrons of soldiers, digital extras were not used; instead, photography of real squadrons was cloned. Sony Pictures Imageworks also digitally expanded details on stage locations and at practical locations. The exterior of Hitler's Bavarian residence Berghof was digitally created, since little {{was left of the}} original structure, and the creation was superimposed on <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> a ski area in Austria. In Berlin itself, city officials helped reduce the need for visual effects by removing power poles and modern lighting over the weekend when filming took place and restoring the equipment by the start of the new week.|$|E
5|$|In linking these shots together, Hepworth {{attempted}} {{to avoid the}} confusion of earlier multi-shot films such as Edwin S. Porter's The Great Train Robbery (1903). Three shots are used {{to set up the}} plot, that of the baby being stolen by a beggar woman. Nearly all of the following shots show Rover tracking down the child. When the dog returns home, the shots' settings are repeated in reverse as the dog travels them; they are shown again in the original order, for a third time, when the dog brings the father. A fourth repetition is, rather radically for its time, spared by showing the kidnapper's return to her room followed by <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> the reunited family.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{cinematic}} techniques by which von Stroheim portrayed naturalism was animal symbolism. In Greed McTeague {{is associated with}} a canary, only briefly mentioned in the novel. Von Stroheim altered Norris's original ending and has McTeague release the canary in Death Valley. McTeague buys Trina a female canary as a wedding gift and early in their marriage von Stroheim cuts from <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> them kissing to birds fluttering wildly in their cage. Another scene with animal imagery includes cross-cutting between a cat attempting to pounce on the canaries in the scene where Schouler bids goodbye to McTeague and Trina without telling them that he has informed on McTeague. Dogs, cats and monkeys are associated with various supporting characters. Von Stroheim also used the naturalist technique of giving characters specific objects, gestures or phrases that repeat throughout the film as a visual leitmotif. For example, Trina tugs on her lips and McTeague fiddles with his birdcage.|$|E
5|$|Perlman, a {{frequent}} collaborator with director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, {{said in a}} 2009 AMC Networks featurette that Alien Resurrection was his only film in which he feared for his life. During the filming of the underwater scene, Perlman struggled with the aquatic set and nearly drowned {{because he could not}} reach its openings. In a character-breaking occurrence, Perlman nearly compromised <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> Sigourney Weaver making a basket from behind but editor Hervé Schneid was able to remove Perlman's reaction from the scene. In From Alien to The Matrix: Reading Science Fiction Film, Roz Kaveney interprets Johner and Number 8 as monogamous animals, with a weaker, aggressive male unsuccessfully attempting to seduce a stronger female.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{shooting}} {{took place}} at the Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, during late 2007. Principal photography began on January 2008 in New Zealand. One of the filming locations that was selected was Dunedin. Controversy arose as the Queenstown Lakes District Council disputed the Department of Labour's decision to allow Fox to store explosives in the local ice skating rink. Fox moved some of the explosives to another area. The explosives were used for <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> the exploding Hudson Farm, a scene which required thirteen cameras. Jackman and Palermo's Woz Productions reached an agreement with the council to allow recycling specialists on set to advise the production on being environmentally friendly. According to Hood, the screenplay was still incomplete as filming begun, with the production in Australia receiving regularly new script pages from Los Angeles, at times in the night before shooting.|$|E
