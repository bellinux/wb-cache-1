5|$|Three British women {{competed in}} {{freestyle}} skiing events, one {{each in the}} aerials, moguls <b>and</b> <b>ski</b> cross. Sarah Sauvey became the first Briton to compete in Olympic ski cross, as the sport was making its debut in Vancouver.

5|$|Athletes {{train for}} each level on a {{seasonal}} schedule {{designed for the}} targeted events: marathon or mid-distance. Additional aspects of training address aerobic (low-intensity) exercise—especially for endurance—and strength to improve joint flexibility and {{to minimize the risk}} of injury. Cross-country ski training occurs throughout the year, including on dry land where athletes engage in roller skiing <b>and</b> <b>ski</b> striding to maintain ski-specific muscle fitness.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{construction}} of the high-speed Gardermoen Line from Oslo, via Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, to Eidsvoll, the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications started planning additional high-speed lines west and southeast of Oslo. The Asker and Follo Lines would allow express and regional trains to travel faster and more reliably to Drammen <b>and</b> <b>Ski,</b> leaving the old tracks for slower freight trains, and commuter trains making frequent stops. Construction of the Follo Line will, at the earliest, be completed in 2015.|$|E

5|$|Freestyle {{skiing is}} one of the six skiing {{disciplines}} contested at the Winter Olympic Games, and one of the youngest. In 1924, the first Winter Olympics featured Nordic skiing disciplines (cross-country skiing, ski jumping, and Nordic combined), while alpine skiing was first contested in 1936. Only at the 1992 Winter Olympics, in Albertville, France, were freestyle skiing events first held as official medal events. Before that, freestyle skiing was contested at the 1988 Winter Olympics as a demonstration sport, consisting of events {{for both men and women}} in three variants: moguls, aerials <b>and</b> <b>ski</b> ballet. In Albertville, moguls was the first-ever official freestyle skiing medal event; aerials <b>and</b> <b>ski</b> ballet were also held but still as demonstration events. The growing popularity of aerials convinced the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to add this freestyle discipline to the 1994 Winter Olympics official program. Moguls and aerials have thus been contested at every Winter Games since. Ski cross inclusion in the Winter Olympics program was approved at an IOC Executive Board meeting in November 2006, and the first events were held at the 2010 Winter Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Prevc started {{training}} in ski jumping {{at the age}} of nine at the Bregarca K25 hill, located in Dolenja Vas. In December 2009, he made his World Cup debut. In the following seven seasons, he collected 21 individual and 9 team wins. He won the 2015/16 overall title and finished second twice. He also represented Slovenia at two Winter Olympics and several World Championships, Nordic <b>and</b> <b>Ski</b> Flying, and is the current ski flying world champion.|$|E
5|$|The FIS 'race director' and 'jury' are a {{core team}} of {{personnel}} {{in charge of}} the entire event. Walter Hofer has been the FIS chief race director of ski flying <b>and</b> <b>ski</b> jumping events since 1992. Borek Sedlák, himself a former ski jumper, has been the assistant race director and second-in-command to Hofer since 2017. Spectators at the venue watching from large screen displays, as well as viewers watching on TV, are able to see instant replays and on-screen graphics provided by the FIS, which display a multitude of detailed information.|$|E

5|$|The {{commuter}} train serves suburbs {{further away from}} Oslo, {{though some of the}} commuter rail services remind of a rapid transit service, in particular line L1 and line L2, to Lillestrøm, Asker <b>and</b> <b>Ski,</b> with higher service frequency through the continual populated area of Oslo. Transfer to railway services is available at Jernbanetorget (to Oslo S) and Nationaltheatret, the latter with a considerably shorter walk.|$|E
5|$|A common {{situation}} in ski jumping, and especially ski flying {{due to the}} magnified risks overall, arises when unfavourable weather conditions cause a competition to be cut short or cancelled completely; it is also not uncommon for an entire event to be cancelled. Reasons include strong winds, a lack of (or too much) snow, and poor visibility for athletes or judges. In {{the case of a}} shortened competition, the scores from the first round – if completed – are used to determine the final result. This is called a single-round competition and still counts towards both the Ski Flying <b>and</b> <b>Ski</b> Jumping World Cup. For the World Championships, if one of the two competitions is cancelled, the final result will be based on the competition that took place.|$|E
5|$|Both Schlesselman and Cowart {{acknowledged}} {{that they would}} be killed {{as a result of the}} murders and insisted they were willing to die. Authorities said the pair planned to break into a gun shop to steal more weapons for their attack, and also bought nylon rope <b>and</b> <b>ski</b> masks at Walmart to use in a robbery or home invasion to fund the spree. Schlesselman and Cowart asked a friend to drive them to a house they planned to rob, but they cancelled the robbery after getting scared by a dog and two vehicles in the driveway.|$|E

5|$|Events {{under the}} Ski Flying World Cup have several {{differences}} to the Ski Flying World Championships. The latter is an isolated tournament, or one-off event, {{in the same}} vein as the Ski Jumping World Championships and Winter Olympics, whereas the Ski Flying World Cup is part of the overall Ski Jumping World Cup season, and uses the same points system. These points contribute towards both Ski Flying <b>and</b> <b>Ski</b> Jumping World Cup standings; the former being effectively a 'mini season' within the latter. However, a feature shared with the Ski Flying World Championships is that the starting order switches over from the Ski Jumping World Cup standings to the Ski Flying World Cup standings after the first competition of the latter, and remains that way for all subsequent events.|$|E
5|$|For the 2010 Ski Flying World Cup season, {{beginning}} in Oberstdorf, and from thereon used at all ski flying <b>and</b> <b>ski</b> jumping events, a supplementary points system was introduced. This system {{takes into account}} the wind speed and direction during each jump, as well as mid-round start gate adjustments, in order to enable a more fair contest. If a headwind is present, this is deemed an unfair advantage and points are therefore deducted as 'compensation'; if a tailwind is present, this is deemed to be a disadvantage and additional points are awarded instead. The amount of deduction or addition is calculated via coefficient using complex instrumentation which analyses the wind conditions at the time of a jump, and the value of the points themselves are in minimum increments of 0.1.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to being}} awarded the World championships in 2004, Liberec had hosted {{a total of}} 40 cross country skiing, Nordic combined, <b>and</b> <b>ski</b> jumping {{competitions}} though it had not hosted a cross country World Cup event by June 2005. At a 24–25 May 2005 meeting, a report was given by the Liberec committee to the FIS race directors on course inspection, including layout of the courses. On 10 May 2006, a coordination group meeting was held led by Roman Kumpošt, the first organizing committee chair, regarding venue construction, television production, and construction within Liberec itself {{in preparation for the}} championships. A coordination meeting took place in Liberec 18–19 April 2007 to discuss venue information and event preparation.|$|E

5|$|Skiing in Revelstoke {{started in}} 1890 with {{the influx of}} Norwegian {{immigrants}} who brought with them their tradition of home-made skies. By the early 1910s, ski jumping was a major pastime during winter, with small ski jumps being built all around the town. Revelstoke Ski Club was founded in 1914 and reached 102 members within a year. Starting in 1915, the club's annual high point was the Winter Carnival Tournament. The first tournament was held in 1915, and featured competitions in cross-country skiing <b>and</b> <b>ski</b> jumping for boys under 16, and awarded the title of Champion of British Columbia. The inaugurate tournament was won by Nels Nelson.|$|E
5|$|The 1988 Winter Olympics, officially {{known as}} the XV Olympic Winter Games, was a winter multi-sport event held in Calgary, Canada, from 13 to 28 February 1988. A total of 1,423 athletes {{representing}} 57 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) (+8 from 1984 Olympics) participated in 46 events (+7 from 1984) from 10 different sports and disciplines (unchanged from 1984). Five new events were contested at these Games—men's and women's Super G in alpine skiing, team events in Nordic combined <b>and</b> <b>ski</b> jumping, and women's 5000metres in speed skating—and two events returned to the program—men's and women's combined in alpine skiing.|$|E
5|$|Vikersundbakken opened as Northern Europe's only {{ski flying}} hill in March 1966. The hill was later renovated and {{expanded}} {{ahead of the}} FIS Ski-Flying World Championships 1977 and again ahead of the FIS Ski-Flying World Championships 1990. Holmenkollen National Arena and Holmenkollbakken were declared the national venue for Nordic skiing in 1997, ahead of Granåsen in Trondheim and Lysgårdsbakken in Lillehammer. By then ideas had been launched to build a national ski flying hill in Rødkleiva. However, it was rejected both by Holmenkollen director Rolf Nyhus <b>and</b> <b>ski</b> jumping director Odd Hammernes, who stated that a new ski flying hill would be too expensive.|$|E
