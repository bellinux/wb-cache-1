40|$|Purpose: Although {{some studies}} among {{adolescent}} girls found that friends within friendship groups were rather similar on dieting and/or body image constructs, these studies were limited by their cross-sectional designs. The current prospective {{study is the}} first to examine friendship group influences on eating disorder risk factors, including body dissatisfaction, weight concerns, dietary restraint, <b>and</b> <b>dieting</b> in adolescent girls. Methods: Design was a two-wave prospective study with 1 -year interval. Of 863 girls (mean age 13. 8, SD =. 7), 344 were members of one of the 103 reciprocal friendship groups identified using social network analysis. Results: Reciprocal friends were similar with respect to body image <b>and</b> <b>dieting</b> constructs. However, initial friendship group levels of body dissatisfaction, weight concerns, dietary restraint, <b>and</b> <b>dieting</b> did not predict individual body image <b>and</b> <b>dieting</b> variables 1 year later. Conclusions: The current findings attest to the significance of reciprocal friendship group correlates of eating disorder risk factors, but suggest that during early-to-mid-adolescence, levels of body image concerns <b>and</b> <b>dieting</b> within reciprocal friendship groups do not influence adolescents' own body image concerns <b>and</b> <b>dieting</b> over 1 year of time...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the trek}} found archaeological {{artifacts}} related to 19th-century Europeans and undisturbed disarticulated human remains, Beattie {{was disappointed that}} more remains were not found. Examining the bones of Franklin crewmen, he noted areas of pitting and scaling often found in cases of Vitamin C deficiency, the cause of scurvy. After returning to Edmonton, he compared notes from the survey with James Savelle, an Arctic archaeologist, and noticed skeletal patterns suggesting cannibalism. Seeking information about the Franklin crew's health <b>and</b> <b>diet,</b> he sent bone samples to the Alberta Soil and Feed Testing Laboratory for trace element analysis and assembled another team to visit King William Island. The analysis would find an unexpected level of 226parts per million (ppm) of lead in the crewman's bones, which was 10times higher than the control samples, taken from Inuit skeletons from the same geographic area, of 26–36ppm.|$|E

5|$|In a {{long-lived}} {{bird with}} a small clutch size such as the Atlantic puffin, the survival rate of adults {{is an important factor}} influencing the success of the species. Only 5% of the ringed puffins that failed to reappear at the colony did so during the breeding season. The rest were lost some time between departing from land in the summer and reappearing the following spring. The birds spend the winter widely spread out in the open ocean, though there is a tendency for individuals from different colonies to overwinter in different areas. Little is known of their behaviour <b>and</b> <b>diet</b> at sea but no correlation was found between environmental factors, such as temperature variations, and their mortality rate. A combination of the availability of food in winter and summer probably influences the survival of the birds, since individuals starting the winter in poor condition are less likely to survive than those in good condition.|$|E
5|$|The American {{alligator}} {{has also}} suffered serious declines from hunting and habitat loss throughout its range, threatening it with extinction. In 1967 it {{was listed as}} an endangered species, but the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and state wildlife agencies in the Southern United States stepped in and worked towards its recovery. Protection allowed the species to recuperate, and in 1987 it {{was removed from the}} endangered species list. Much research into alligator ranching has been undertaken at the Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge, a large area of marshland in the state of Louisiana. The resulting data has increased understanding of penning, stocking rates, egg incubation, hatching, rearing, <b>and</b> <b>diet,</b> and this information has been used at other establishments around the world. Income from the alligators kept at Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge contributes to conservation of the marshland. A study examining alligator farms in the United States showed that they have generated significant conservation gains, and poaching of wild alligators has greatly diminished.|$|E

40|$|Objective - Increased weight concern <b>and</b> <b>dieting</b> are {{associated}} with both depression and smoking among adolescents, particularly girls. This cross-sectional study examined the gender-specific role of weight concerns <b>and</b> <b>dieting</b> on the adolescent depression–smoking association. Methods - Participants were 2051 adolescents (1056 boys and 995 girls) from seven {{high schools in the}} Netherlands who filled out questionnaires on smoking, depression, and weight constructs and of whom weight and height were measured. Results - Logistic regression analyses showed that for girls, but not for boys, the depression–smoking association disappeared after controlling for weight concerns <b>and</b> <b>dieting.</b> Conclusion - Our findings indicate that weight concerns <b>and</b> <b>dieting</b> are important factors to consider in the depression–smoking initiation relation for girls, but not for boys. This suggests that smoking prevention programs for depressed girls might be enhanced by challenging the idea of smoking as a <b>diet</b> strategy <b>and</b> incorporating a focus on healthy weight regulation. However, before setting up a prevention trial, future prospective studies should first examine why and how weight concerns <b>and</b> <b>dieting</b> are important factors in the depression–smoking initiation relation among girls, also in conjunction with other established risk factors such as parental and peer smoking...|$|R

5|$|Amundsen {{was born}} in Fredrikstad (around 80km from Christiania (now Oslo)), Norway, in 1872, {{the son of a}} ship-owner. In 1893, he {{abandoned}} his medical studies at Christiania University and signed up as a seaman aboard the sealer Magdalena for a voyage to the Arctic. After several further voyages he qualified as a second mate; when not at sea, he developed his skills as a cross-country skier in the harsh environment of Norway's Hardangervidda plateau. In 1896, inspired by the polar exploits of his countryman Fridtjof Nansen, Amundsen joined the Belgian Antarctic Expedition as mate, aboard Belgica under Adrien de Gerlache. Early in 1898 the ship became trapped by pack ice in the Bellinghausen Sea, and was held fast for almost a year. The expedition thus became, involuntarily, the first to spend a complete winter in Antarctic waters, a period marked by depression, near-starvation, insanity, and scurvy among the crew. Amundsen remained dispassionate, recording everything and using the experience as an education in all aspects of polar exploration techniques, particularly aids, clothing <b>and</b> <b>diet.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like {{all other}} lemurs, Hadropithecus was endemic to Madagascar. Because it died out only {{recently}} {{and is only}} known from subfossil remains, it {{is considered to be}} a modern form of Malagasy lemur. It once ranged across the Central Plateau, South, and Southwest regions of Madagascar. Within its original range, there were few other lemurs to overlap its ecological niche, and it has been shown to be the only subfossil lemur to consume both C3 and C4 (or CAM) plants, an indication that it lived in more open habitats and had a varied diet. Its physiology and dentition suggest that it may have been much like the Gelada Baboon in locomotion <b>and</b> <b>diet,</b> acting as a manual grazer (picking grass with the hands) since its teeth were well-adapted for grinding either grass or seeds. Microwear patterns on its teeth, as well as its overly large molars, indicate it processed hard objects like nuts or seeds, making it a seed predator. More recent microwear analysis suggests differences between Gelada Baboons and Hadropithecus, indicating that this extinct lemur may not have been a grazer, but strictly a hard object processor.|$|E
5|$|The {{agricultural}} {{sector of the}} English economy, still by far the largest, was transformed by the Black Death. With the shortage of manpower after the Black Death, wages for agricultural labourers rapidly increased and continued to then grow steadily throughout the 15th century. As their incomes increased, labourers' living conditions <b>and</b> <b>diet</b> improved steadily. A trend for labourers to eat less barley and more wheat and rye, and to replace bread in their diet with more meat, had been apparent since before the Black Death, but intensified during this later period. Nonetheless, England's much smaller population needed less food {{and the demand for}} agricultural products fell. The position of the larger landowners became increasingly difficult. Revenues from demesne lands were diminishing as demand remained low and wage costs increased; nobles were also finding it more difficult to raise revenue from their local courts, fines and privileges in the years after the Peasants Revolt of 1381. Despite attempts to increase money rents, {{by the end of the}} 14th century the rents paid from peasant lands were also declining, with revenues falling as much as 55% between the 1380s and 1420s.|$|E
