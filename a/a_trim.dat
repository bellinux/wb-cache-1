5|$|Just {{because an}} SSD {{supports}} the TRIM command {{does not necessarily}} mean {{it will be able to}} perform at top speed immediately after <b>a</b> <b>TRIM</b> command. The space which is freed up after the TRIM command may be at random locations spread throughout the SSD. It will take a number of passes of writing data and garbage collecting before those spaces are consolidated to show improved performance.|$|E
5|$|Drives which encrypt all {{writes on}} the fly can {{implement}} ATA Secure Erase in another way. They simply zeroize and generate a new random encryption key each time a secure erase is done. In this way the old data cannot be read anymore, as it cannot be decrypted. Some drives with an integrated encryption may require <b>a</b> <b>TRIM</b> command {{be sent to the}} drive to put the drive back to its original out-of-box state.|$|E
5|$|Henry Henniger, the {{president}} of Kennywood Entertainment Company, wanted a large steel coaster in the late 1980s. The park had only built wooden roller coasters in the past. The park also had a very tight layout {{and they were not}} sure how to fit it into the park. On July 27, 1990, Kennywood announced the name of their new roller coaster would be Steel Phantom and it would use the same station as Laser Loop, which it replaced. The ride opened on May 10, 1991 as the fastest and steepest steel roller coaster in the world. The inversions were a vertical loop, a Boomerang, and a corkscrew. As a result of the inversions, riders experienced more-than-usual head banging. Shortly after its debut, <b>a</b> <b>trim</b> brake was added because the coaster was going faster than it should through the inversions and riders were experiencing pain in their necks.|$|E

25|$|Haarmann {{grew into}} <b>a</b> <b>trim,</b> {{physically}} strong youth. With his parents' consent, {{he finished his}} schooling in 1894.

Durán then announced his retirement in August 1998, but was back fighting in 1999.|$|E

The CR-V SE featured painted bumpers, body side molding, and hard, body-colored spare tire cover. For a more luxurious experience, Honda added a leather interior, leather-wrapped steering wheel, and heated side mirrors and front seats.|$|E

Initially, the colors that were to be used were simply blue and white, but by popular demand, black was later added as <b>a</b> <b>trim</b> color on the numbers.

25|$|Cases, {{especially}} bottleneck cases, will stretch upon firing. How much a {{case will}} stretch depends upon load pressure, cartridge design, chamber size, functional cartridge headspace (usually {{the most important}} factor), and other variables. Periodically cases need to be trimmed {{to bring them back}} into proper specifications. Most reloading manuals list both <b>a</b> <b>trim</b> size and a max length. Long cases can create a safety hazard through improper headspace and possible increased pressure.|$|E
25|$|After 1971, other GM {{divisions}} began rebadging the Nova {{as their}} new entry-level vehicle, {{such as the}} Pontiac Ventura II (once <b>a</b> <b>trim</b> option for full-size Pontiacs to 1970), Oldsmobile Omega and the Buick Apollo. This was considered to build brand loyalty with respective GM divisions although the company later fused their badge engineering with platform sharing to cut expenditures. Interestingly, the initials of the four model names spelled out the acronym NOVA (Nova, Omega, Ventura, Apollo).|$|E

25|$|In 1991, Toho {{issued a}} {{restored}} laserdisc incorporating the rediscovery of a reel of 35mm trims of the deleted footage.

This laserdisc master was utilized for Toho's 2001 DVD release with few changes.|$|E
25|$|Many {{of these}} Grey adaptations were remakes of earlier silent films. In {{an effort to}} save on {{production}} costs, Paramount utilized stock footage from the silent version and even hired {{some of the same}} actors, such as Raymond Hatton and Noah Beery, to repeat their roles. For the 1933 films The Thundering Herd and Man of the Forest, Scott's hair was darkened and he sported <b>a</b> <b>trim</b> moustache so that he could easily be matched to footage of Jack Holt, the star of the silent versions.|$|E

When examined, female hamsters have their anal and genital openings close together, whereas males have these two holes farther apart (the penis is usually withdrawn into the coat and thus appears as a hole or pink pimple).|$|E

It also has a high thrust-to-weight ratio and large speed brakes. These features combined {{allow it to be}} used as a high-fidelity moving platform flight simulator for SpaceShipOne. White Knight is also equipped with <b>a</b> <b>trim</b> system which (when activated) causes it to have the same glide profile as SpaceShipOne; this allows the pilots to practice for landing SpaceShipOne.

Shoppers could even get an SS station wagon this year - with the option of a 454-cubic-inch V8 engine, no less—but the mix of sport and {{utilitarian}} wagon virtues would last only a single season. Included was a black grill with SS emblem, lower bodyside and wheel opening striping, bright roof drip moldings, color-keyed dual sport mirrors, black taillight bezels, SS fender and rear panel emblems, special front and rear stabilizer bars, 14x7 inch rally wheels, 70-series raised white lettered tires, special instrumentation and SS interior emblems.|$|E
25|$|Vim: Designed in 1939 by Olin Stephens who {{considered}} the possibilities given by {{every aspect of}} the rules and produced a very fast boat. Vim had numerous innovative features including <b>a</b> <b>trim</b> tab on the rudder, two-speed winches and a lighter mast made of Duralumin (a form of aluminium used in the aircraft industry). Vim is considered a benchmark design which was continually refined over her racing career. In 1939 Vim came to the UK and won 19 races out of 28. The next generations of 12 Metres designed and built 20 years after Vim was launched still found Vim extremely difficult to beat in competition.|$|E
