5|$|The {{strength}} of an interest {{is determined by}} {{a consideration of the}} value of something to an individual (though this is not understood purely subjectively) and the relationship between the individual at this time and the individual when he or she has the interest satisfied (see personal identity). Cochrane argues that those beings who lack personhood, including many nonhuman animals and some humans, do not have an interest in liberty or not being used by others, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>have</b> no prima facie right to freedom. They do, however, possess significant interests in not being made to suffer and in not being killed, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>have</b> a prima facie right not to be made to suffer and a prima facie right not to be killed.|$|E
5|$|Supernova {{searches}} {{fall into}} two classes: those focused on relatively nearby events and those looking farther away. Because of {{the expansion of the}} universe, the distance to a remote object with a known emission spectrum can be estimated by measuring its Doppler shift (or redshift); on average, more-distant objects recede with greater velocity than those nearby, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>have</b> a higher redshift. Thus the search is split between high redshift and low redshift, with the boundary falling around a redshift range of z=0.1–0.3—where z is a dimensionless measure of the spectrum's frequency shift.|$|E

5|$|Didsbury's built {{environment}} has developed around {{the areas of}} East Didsbury, West Didsbury, and Didsbury Village, which separates the two. The Albert Park conservation area, covering much of West Didsbury, places planning restrictions on development, alterations to buildings, and pruning of trees. The areas adjacent to the Mersey lie within the river's flood plain, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>have</b> historically been prone to flooding after heavy rainfall. The last major flooding was in the late 1960s. In the 1970s extensive flood mitigation work carried out along the Mersey Valley through Manchester has helped {{to speed up the}} passage of floodwater. Fletcher Moss Botanical Garden also acts as an emergency flood basin, storing floodwater until it can be safely released back into the river.|$|E

25|$|In any {{study of}} Angkorian architecture, the {{emphasis}} is necessarily on religious architecture, since all the remaining Angkorian buildings are religious in nature. During the period of Angkor, only temples and other religious buildings were constructed of stone. Non-religious buildings such as dwellings were constructed of perishable materials such as wood, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>have</b> not survived.|$|E

25|$|Some persons, such as {{the artist}} Christo, the {{sculptor}} Chryssa, and the singer-songwriter Basia, have had polynymous names that were unwieldy, or unfamiliar and difficult to remember or to pronounce in the community {{in which they were}} currently active, but have not wanted to entirely change their names to something more familiar to the broad public at the cost of abandoning their sense of self-identification, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>have</b> used only a single part of their full names.|$|E

The spray is fine and abundant and lies horizontally {{so that the}} foliage arrangement is not unlike that of the beech (Fagus). Its often spectacular autumnal coloring, with intense reds to purples, is highly valued in landscape settings. It is the most fiery and brilliant of the 'brilliant group' that includes maple, dogwood, sassafras, and sweet gum, as well as various species of tupelo.|$|E
25|$|The ends of {{the east}} gable consist of a corbelled turret on the outside corners with eight crow steps rising to the middle. The crow steps on the west wall are {{truncated}} {{by the presence of}} the tower <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>have</b> only 1½ steps. Other colonial structures with gables are few and include Bacon's Castle(1665) the second Bruton Parish Church, (1680s), and St. Peter's Church, New Kent County (1701) all of which are characterized by Flemish curved gables instead of crow step gables. All of the cornices are modern replacements.|$|E
25|$|The Koine Greek terms {{used in the}} New Testament of the {{structure}} on which Jesus died are stauros (σταυρός) and xylon (ξύλον). Those words, which can refer to many different things, do not indicate the precise shape of {{the structure}}. Scholars {{have long known that}} the Greek word stauros and the Latin word crux did not uniquely mean a cross. They have known too that the words had that meaning also, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>have</b> not considered necessarily incorrect the traditional picture of a cross with transom.|$|E
50|$|As an example, {{consider}} a valuable ring {{which happens to}} be lost. Its inherent condition is that it is valuable <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>has</b> lots of essential dignity. However, its current state is that it is lost <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>has</b> little accidental dignity. The significator for the ring in this horary might, for example, be Venus in Taurus (good essential dignity) but retrograde and combust (accidentally debilitated).|$|R

25|$|Mopane {{woodland}} savannah predominates in the area, {{with smaller}} areas of miombo and Rhodesian teak woodland and scrubland savannah. Riverine forest with palm trees lines {{the banks and}} islands above the falls. The most notable aspect of the area's vegetation though is the rainforest nurtured by the spray from the falls, containing plants rare for the area such as pod mahogany, ebony, ivory palm, wild date palm {{and a number of}} creepers and lianas. Vegetation has suffered in recent droughts, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>have</b> the animals that depend on it, particularly antelope.|$|E
25|$|A planet's {{atmospheric}} conditions influence {{its ability to}} retain heat, so that {{the location of the}} habitable zone is also specific to each type of planet: desert planets (also known as dry planets), with very little water, will have less water vapor in the atmosphere than Earth <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>have</b> a reduced greenhouse effect, meaning that a desert planet could maintain oases of water closer to its star than Earth is to the Sun. The lack of water also means there is less ice to reflect heat into space, so the outer edge of desert-planet habitable zones is further out.|$|E
25|$|Any monadic Boolean algebra can be {{considered}} to be an interior algebra where the interior operator is the universal quantifier and the closure operator is the existential quantifier. The monadic Boolean algebras are then precisely the variety of interior algebras satisfying the identity xIC = xI. In other words, they are precisely the interior algebras in which every open element is closed or equivalently, in which every closed element is open. Moreover, such interior algebras are precisely the semisimple interior algebras. They are also the interior algebras corresponding to the modal logic S5, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>have</b> also been called S5 algebras.|$|E

25|$|Esperanto has not {{fragmented}} into regional dialects through {{natural language}} use. This {{may be because}} it is the language of daily communication for only a small minority of its speakers. However at least three other factors work against dialects, namely the centripetal force of the Fundamento, the unifying influence of the Plena Vortaro and its successors, which exemplified usage from the works of Zamenhof and leading writers, and the transnational ambitions of the speech community itself. Slang and jargon have developed to some extent, but such features interfere with universal communication – the whole point of Esperanto – <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>have</b> generally been avoided.|$|E
25|$|The park {{management}} {{is trying to}} protect and conserve the park’s natural and cultural heritage in the most natural state possible. It places emphasis on maintaining a healthy and high yielding rainfall catchment. Upland swamps are also important due to the rare species they contain, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>have</b> been classified as a Priority Fauna Habitat. The park management also helps conserve area outside the park perimeter. The {{management is}} also rehabilitating areas disturbed by invasive species {{with a focus on}} sedgeland – Health Complex, heath woodland, ironstone woodland and ironstone heath. Maintenance of rare, threatened and endangered flora and fauna is a priority along with maintaining diversity and regenerating areas, which have been disturbed.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to divergence in their core catalytic machinery, the PA clan proteases also show wide divergent evolution in function. Members of the PA clan {{can be found}} in eukaryotes, prokaryotes and viruses and encompass a wide range of functions. In mammals, some are involved in blood clotting (e.g. thrombin) <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>have</b> high substrate specificity as well as digestion (e.g. trypsin) with broad substrate specificity. Several snake venoms are also PA clan proteases, such as pit viper haemotoxin and interfere with the victim's blood clotting cascade. Additionally, bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus secrete exfoliative toxin which digest and damage the host's tissues. Finally, many viruses express their genome as a single, massive polyprotein and use a protease to cleave this into functional units (e.g. polio, norovirus, and TEV proteases).|$|E
