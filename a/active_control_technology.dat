40|$|The {{application}} of <b>active</b> <b>controls</b> <b>technology</b> to subsonic, long-range transport aircraft {{was investigated in}} three Advanced Transport Technology system studies.

5000|$|... iBOT is {{a radical}} power chair {{developed}} by Dean Kamen that incorporates gyroscopic and <b>active</b> <b>control</b> <b>technology,</b> enabling the chair to balance and run on only two of its four wheels on some surfaces, thus raising the user to standing height. It is also able to climb stairs by leveraging the standing feature. The popular Segway Personal Transporter is a mobility device that was a direct outgrowth {{of the development of}} the iBOT wheelchair. The Segway, which is basically an iBOT with two wheels removed, was developed explicitly {{to increase the number of}} units produced and take advantage of the economies of scale to attempt to make the iBOT affordable to wheelchair users. While popular in concept, the $25,000 iBOT, which was developed as a joint venture between Johnson and Johnson's Independence Technology and Kamen's DEKA Research, was priced at too high a price point to sustain the needed production and was discontinued in January 2009. On May 21, 2016, Toyota announced a partnership with DEKA to produce a new version of the iBOT. No release date was set at the time of the announcement.|$|E
