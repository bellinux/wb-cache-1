25|$|Opportunistic {{activity}} by combinations of otherwise normal bacterial flora, such as aerobic streptococci, Neisseria, <b>Actinomyces,</b> spirochetes, and Bacteroides species can prolong the ulcerative process. Fungal causes include Coccidioides immitis (valley fever), Cryptococcus neoformans (cryptococcosis), and Blastomyces dermatitidis ("North American Blastomycosis"). Entamoeba histolytica, a parasitic protozoan, is sometimes {{known to cause}} mouth ulcers through formation of cysts.|$|E
25|$|As {{dental plaque}} or biofilm accumulates on the teeth near {{and below the}} gums, there is {{a shift in the}} {{composition}} of the biofilm from essentially streptococcus to an <b>actinomyces</b> dominant plaque. Motile bacteria is also seen more frequently. As this happens, inflammation sets in the gingiva. Initially, this takes the form of gingivitis, which represents inflammation confined to the soft tissues above the bone level. Inflammation in the gingiva can remain at the gingivitis level for a long period and will not progress to periodontitis, unless in the presence of local conditions or generalized host susceptibility. When this shift occurs, the immune system's response to plaque accumulation shifts from a predominantly neutrophilic mediated response to lymphocytic and plasma cell-mediated response. Clinically, the gingiva presents swelling, redness and a tendency to bleed. This modifies the environment, leading to changes in the composition of the biofilm itself. As this happens, a predominantly gram-negative environment is established, with periodontal pathogens emerging. These include A. actinomycetemcomitans, the red complex bacteria (P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, T. denticola) {{and to a lesser extent}} the orange complex bacteria (F. nucleatum, P. micros, P. intermedia, P. nigrecens, E. nodatum and S. constellates). Strongest bacterial association to chronic periodontitis is with P. gingivalis. Numerous virulence factors have been identified for this pathogen. This allows P. gingivalis to elude defense mechanism and perpetuate inflammation inside the periodontium. Prolonged inflammation in the periodontium leads to an apical shift in the attachment of the gingiva to the tooth with deepening pockets and bone loss around the teeth. Untreated periodontitis progresses unevenly over time but results in loss of function, tissue destruction, and tooth loss.|$|E
2500|$|Nutritional {{stress can}} change {{bacterial}} morphology. [...] A common shape alteration is filamentation {{which can be}} triggered by a limited availability {{of one or more}} substrates, nutrients or electron acceptors. Since the filament can increase a cell’s uptake–surface area without significantly changing its volume appreciably. [...] Moreover, the filamentation benefits bacterial cells attaching to a surface because it increases specific surface area in direct contact with the solid medium. In addition, the filamentation may allows bacterial cells to access nutrients by enhancing the possibility that part of the filament will contact a nutrient-rich zone and pass compounds {{to the rest of the}} cell’s biomass. For example, <b>Actinomyces</b> israelii grows as filamentous rods or branched in the absence of phosphate, cysteine, or glutathione. However, it returns to a regular rod-like morphology when adding back these nutrients.|$|E
2500|$|The mouth {{contains}} {{a wide variety}} of oral bacteria, but only a few specific species of bacteria are believed to cause dental caries: Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus species among them. Streptococcus mutans are gram-positive bacteria which constitute biofilms on the surface of teeth. These organisms can produce high levels of lactic acid following fermentation of dietary sugars and are resistant to the adverse effects of low pH, properties essential for cariogenic bacteria. [...] As the cementum of root surfaces is more easily demineralized than enamel surfaces, a wider variety of bacteria can cause root caries, including Lactobacillus acidophilus, <b>Actinomyces</b> spp., Nocardia spp., and Streptococcus mutans. [...] Bacteria collect around the teeth and gums in a sticky, creamy-coloured mass called plaque, which serves as a biofilm. Some sites collect plaque more commonly than others, for example, sites with a low rate of salivary flow (molar fissures). [...] Grooves on the occlusal surfaces of molar and premolar teeth provide microscopic retention sites for plaque bacteria, as do the interproximal sites. Plaque may also collect above or below the gingiva, where it is referred to as supra- or sub-gingival plaque, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Biological {{nitrogen}} fixation (BNF, {{performed by the}} organisms called diazotrophs) is a very old process that probably originated in the Archean eon when the primitive atmosphere lacked oxygen. [...] It is only carried out by Euryarchaeota and just 6 {{of the more than}} 50 phyla of bacteria. Some of these lineages co-evolved together with the flowering plants establishing the molecular basis of a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship. BNF is carried out in nodules that are mainly located in the root cortex, although they are occasionally located in the stem as in Sesbania rostrata. The spermatophytes that co-evolved with actinorhizal diazotrophs (Frankia) or with rhizobia to establish their symbiotic relationship belong to 11 families contained within the Rosidae clade (as established by the gene molecular phylogeny of rbcL, a gene coding for part of the RuBisCO enzyme in the chloroplast). This grouping indicates that the predisposition for forming nodules probably only arose once in flowering plants and that it can be considered as an ancestral characteristic that has been conserved or lost in certain lineages. However, such a wide distribution of families and genera within this lineage indicates that nodulation had multiple origins. Of the 10 families within the Rosidae, 8 have nodules formed by <b>actinomyces</b> (Betulaceae, Casuarinaceae, Coriariaceae, Datiscaceae, Elaeagnaceae, Myricaceae, Rhamnaceae and Rosaceae), and the two remaining families, Ulmaceae and Fabaceae have nodules formed by rhizobia.|$|E
