50|$|Most caves require {{artificial}} {{anchor points}} to secure abseiling rope. A common method of placing bolts is to hand drill them using {{a hammer and}} <b>a</b> <b>self-drilling</b> bolt, using bolts adapted from the construction industry. A hangar can then be screwed into the bolt. Since affordable battery drills came on the market it is more common to see cavers drill the holes and {{use a variety of}} different bolts and concrete screws. Stainless steel resin bolts are used on routes that see a lot of traffic as they have a long life and, if placed correctly, are safe and reliable.|$|E
40|$|The {{method of}} {{supporting}} excavated roof in coal mines by conventional roof bolting systems is challenged {{due to its}} shortcomings of the timeconsuming installation and the increased number of accidents attributable to the work under unsupported roofs. Though a few alternatives have been considered, the ultimate and most efficient bolting method has often been conceived as the one called <b>a</b> <b>self-drilling</b> roof bolt, or a Rapid Face Bolting System. The on-going Rapid Face Bolting project undertaken by the University of Wollongong includes a special drilling bit design, and the principal design considerations for this tubular roof bit are high efficiency and low cost. Through review of the physical properties of different cutting materials, considering {{the special needs of}} the project and establishing a series of special criteria for a tubular roof bit design, two kinds of tubular roof bolts are proposed to suit hard and soft rock formations, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the degree of pain and discomfort experienced for 1 week after miniscrew insertion using a questionnaire survey. Materials and Methods: Thirty-nine miniscrews were inserted in the mandible and maxilla of 33 patients with <b>a</b> <b>self-drilling</b> JB head type miniscrew under local anesthesia. Patients were asked to rate the degree of pain and discomfort experienced on a visual analog scale (VAS) after 1 hour, 12 hours, 1 day, and 1 week. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 22 software. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with considering the jaw, side of insertion, and length of miniscrew as a between subject factor was used. Results: There was no significant association between the length of miniscrew (P = 0. 448), the jaw (P = 0. 870), and the side of the insertion (P = 0. 346) and causing pain. The maximum degree of pain experience was in 1 hour after insertion that was 48. 79 mm in VAS scores, which started to decrease significantly after 12 hours, 1 day, and 1 week as the minimum intensity of the pain was 1 week after the miniscrew insertion that was 2. 31 mm in VAS scores. Conclusion: On the basis of the patient responses, it can be concluded that miniscrew could be an acceptable option in orthodontic treatments...|$|E
30|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{solid model}} of a 35 -mm section of the alveolar bone of the posterior maxilla with <b>a</b> single <b>self-drilling</b> titanium mini-implant (Fig.  1) and subsequent models with varying lengths, diameters, and implant angulation were created. We used the ANSYS Workbench (version 11.0) {{finite element analysis program}} to generate the solid model, create the mesh of individual elements, and perform the post-processing to calculate the stresses and strains.|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} {{reactivity of}} methane excited in the antisymmetric stretching mode (? 3) vs. the ground {{state in a}} prototype metal-insertion reaction, Y + CH 4 ? YCH 2 + H 2, has been measured in crossed molecular beam scattering. Under isoenergetic conditions where the sum of available vibrational and translational energy is held constant, the vibrationally excited state is at least 2. 2 times more reactive than the ground state. The mid-infrared light source used to excite the methane is an Nd:YAGpumped pulsed optical parametric oscillator/amplifier seeded with a continuous wave laser diode in the near infrared. The OPO/OPA system has an overall quantum efficiency of greater than 0. 25 when using 350 mJ/pulse of pump light. The light source also includes <b>a</b> <b>self-drilled</b> vacuum spatial filter for the pump beam, enabling it {{to be used with}} pump lasers exhibiting structured beam profiles. Also presented are new piezo-electric bimorph actuators for use in high-speed pulsed valves used to generate pulsed molecular beams. They are more resistant to chemical attack than their commercial counterparts and deliver shorter pulses. The short pulse duration can provide greater beam intensities for a given pumping speed or reduce the pumping speed required to generate a given beam intensity...|$|R
50|$|Self-tapping screws {{are widely}} used for driving into sheet metal or {{plastics}} and forming their own thread. They may be either self-drilling, forming their own hole through unbroken material, or fitted into <b>a</b> pre-pierced hole. <b>Self-drilling</b> screws have some ability to cut a thread, as for a tap. Others work not by cutting, but rather by roll-forming the thread, pushing excess material {{out of the way}} by plastic deformation. This is one reason why ductile host materials, rather than brittle, are needed.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the short time aesthetic and functional outcome of a new implant system, the Nobel Active. The Nobel Active features several innovations such as <b>an</b> extensive <b>self-drilling</b> capacity, axial and radial bone compression and an inward tapered collar allowing for marginal bone maintance an soft tissue stabilization. This design makes it possible to place the implant into narrower osteotomies, thus requiring less drilling, compared to conventional implants. The Nobel Active implants are available in two different prosthetic connections: Internal connection and external connection. The Nobel Active External connection is a 1. 5 piece implant, with a primary abutment included with the implant. The Nobel Active internal connection is a two piece implant with a standard hexagonal internal connection. In this study we present a single tooth replacement with immediate loading of Nobel Active External connection...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{self-drilling}} prestressed anchor {{is a type}} {{of ground}} anchor used to transmit the applied tensile load into soil or rock through cement grout. The paper outlines a general construction procedure using <b>a</b> special <b>self-drilling</b> bit. Based on the load-transfer mechanism, the construction procedure is presented for load-dispersed ground anchors. In-situ pullout tests were carried out for three self-drilling prestressed anchors of the load-dispersed compression type. The test results showed that the ultimate pullout capacity could reach 800 – 1, 000 kN. After prestressing, the displacement of the anchor head was decreased by 50 % – 70 % for a low load level and 30 % – 40 % for a high load level, and the displacement induced by elastic deformation was much smaller than that induced by plastic deformation. These results demonstrate that this anchor type is suitable and economical for practical engineering needs...|$|R
40|$|Background {{and purpose}} Tibial {{osteotomy}} by the hemicallotasis technique (HCO) requires strong pin fixation. We compared pin fixation in HCO using <b>a</b> new <b>self-drilling</b> XCaliber pin (Orthofix) with optimized thread and tip design, with the commonly used standard pin (Orthofix). Patients and methods 50 patients, mean age 51 (35 - 66) years, {{to be treated}} by HCO were randomized to standard pins or XCaliber pins. In the metaphyseal bone, hydroxyapatite-coated (HA-coated) pins were used in both types of pins. In the diaphyseal bone, non-coated pins were used. The torque forces for insertion and extraction (in Nm) were measured. Results The insertion torque was higher for both the proximal and distal standard pins (2. 1 Nm (SD 0. 9) and 7. 0 Nm (1. 3), respectively) than for the XCaliber pins (1. 3 Nm (0. 8) and 3. 6 Nm (1. 4)). The extraction torque force was higher for the proximal standard pins (4. 3 Nm (3. 1)) than for the proximal XCaliber pins (1. 5 Nm (1. 7)) (p < 0. 001). The extraction torque for the distal standard pins was 1. 9 Nm (2. 0) and for the distal XCaliber pins it was 1. 4 Nm (1. 1). Interpretation The commonly used standard pin gives stronger fixation during the treatment of HCO...|$|R
