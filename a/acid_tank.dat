50|$|All of {{the parts}} showing wear or damage that were {{originally}} painted are typically stripped of old paint, with any rust or rust related damage repaired, dents and ripples removed and then the metal refinished, primed and painted with colors to match the original factory colors. Wooden parts should {{go through the same}} meticulous inspection and repair process with reglueing, replacement of rotted or termite-damaged wood, sealing and refinishing to match the factory specifications. Pressure treatment with preservative may be considered to safeguard against future wood rot. Chrome and trim may require stripping and repair/refinishing. Fasteners with tool marks, damaged threads, or corrosion need re-plating or replacement-unless the car was originally sold that way. The frame must be thoroughly cleaned and repaired if necessary. Often abrasive blasting of the frame is the most expeditious method of cleaning, but it may still leave microscopic rust pitting behind, so should be followed up with a phosphoric acid 'rust killer' solution, before priming. Abrasive blasting using less abrasive soda or crushed walnut shells is less likely than sandblasting to cause damage to fragile items, while still removing corrosion. <b>Acid</b> <b>tank</b> dipping of the frame and or body followed by an E-coat primer after repairs is recognised as the most effective but also most expensive {{way to get rid of}} rust and to protect against future corrosion. The chassis frame should be properly coated for rust protection to at least match the standard of the original, to the highest modern standard would safeguard the time and money invested in the restoration.|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} devoted to {{presenting}} {{the results of an}} investigation directed toward the design of a chemical gas generation system for the Wac Corporal. In this case the function of gas generation is to provide the necessary pressure to inject the propellants into the rocket motor. The investigation indicates that gas can be generated in the main <b>acid</b> <b>tank</b> of the, Wac by injection of a controlled amount of aniline to react with the acid. This aniline is injected {{at the bottom of the}} <b>acid</b> <b>tank,</b> and is supplied from a small pressure cell contained integrally with the injector and aniline flow regulator. Tests show that this system is able to regulate the flow of aniline into the <b>acid</b> <b>tank</b> to maintain a pressure on the propellants with ± 20 psi. of the desired value. A proposed package unit for installation on the Wac Corporal is shown in Fig 1. This unit contains all the parts necessary for the gas generation function, and its installed weight including the aniline, is estimated to be eight lbs. The importance of the installation of such a unit on the Wac is seen when it is realized that the total weight of the gas generation system, including the acid used, will be approximately 25 lbs. This system will replace the 90 lb. air pressurization unit now being used to pressurize the propellants and it will represent a 65 lb. reduction in initial gross weight. Such a weight reduction will lead to greatly improved rocket performance. This report does not attempt to determine the range of gross weights, over which gas generation systems will prove superior to other methods of propellant pressurization. It is felt, however, that a definite upper and lower limit on missile gross weight does exist for which gas generation will be applicable. The Wac Corporal is a sounding rocket of 590 lbs. gross weight using red fuming nitric acid and aniline as propellants. It was designed at the California Institute of Technology Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ...|$|E

The HF tank car closure was conducted by FERMCO. Through a combination of sound planning and team work, the HF tank car was closed safely and ahead of schedule. During > 22, 000 hr field work required for construction modifications and neutralization of 9, 600 gallons of HF and decontamination rinseates, there were no OSHA recordable incidents. The system design avoided additional costs by maximizing use of existing equipment and facilities. This successful closure of the HF tank car demonstrates FEMP`s commitment to reducing risks and cleaning up the facility {{in a manner consistent with}} objectives of RCRA regulations and the Ohio EPA hazardous waste rules. This in turn facilitated ongoing negotiations with Ohio EPA to integrate RCRA closure and the ongoing CERCLA remediation activities. This paper addresses why the unit was clean closed under an approved RCRA Closure Plan. Integration of EPA regulations for RCRA and CERCLA programs and the DOE-Orders impacting design, construction and operation of an acid neutralization system is also reviewed.

The vessel passed guarantee repair work one year after construction. Ship designing was not satisfactory. The cargo <b>acid</b> <b>tanks</b> got external reinforcement of some transverse bulkheads, got internal stiffeners and passed second mineral acid passivation. After {{two and a half}} years after construction external reinforcement of some transverse bulkheads and pad eyes for hanging stages were fitted. Trace weld leakages were discovered in two tanks ({{two and a half years}} after construction). Small openings at transversal bulkhead/bottom weld in one tank were found eight months later. Weld repairs and third mineral acid passivation were performed. At that time heavy grinding work to remove rust was carried out. After four years of exploitation cracks of weld...|$|R

40|$|Prior to {{processing}} a Sludge Batch (SB) in the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF), flowsheet {{studies using}} simulants are performed. Typically, the flowsheet studies are conducted based on projected composition(s). The {{results from the}} flowsheet testing are used to 1) guide decisions during sludge batch preparation, 2) serve as a preliminary evaluation of potential processing issues, and 3) provide a basis to support the Shielded Cells qualification runs performed at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL). SB 8 was initially projected to {{be a combination of}} the Tank 40 heel (Sludge Batch 7 b), Tank 13, Tank 12, and the Tank 51 heel. In order to accelerate preparation of SB 8, {{the decision was made to}} delay the oxalate-rich material from Tank 12 to a future sludge batch. SB 8 simulant studies without Tank 12 were reported in a separate report. 1 The data presented in this report will be useful when processing future sludge batches containing Tank 12. The wash endpoint target for SB 8 was set at a significantly higher sodium concentration to allow acceptable glass compositions at the targeted waste loading. Four non-coupled tests were conducted using simulant representing Tank 40 at 110 - 146 % of the Koopman Minimum Acid requirement. Hydrogen was generated during high acid stoichiometry (146 % acid) SRAT testing up to 31 % of the DWPF hydrogen limit. SME hydrogen generation reached 48 % of of the DWPF limit for the high acid run. Two non-coupled tests were conducted using simulant representing Tank 51 at 110 - 146 % of the Koopman Minimum Acid requirement. Hydrogen was generated during high acid stoichiometry SRAT testing up to 16 % of the DWPF limit. SME hydrogen generation reached 49 % of the DWPF limit for hydrogen in the SME for the high acid run. Simulant processing was successful using previously established antifoam addition strategy. Foaming during formic acid addition was not observed in any of the runs. Nitrite was destroyed in all runs and no N 2 O was detected during SME processing. Mercury behavior was consistent with that seen in previous SRAT runs. Mercury was stripped below the DWPF limit on 0. 8 wt% for all runs. Rheology yield stress fell within or below the design basis of 1 - 5 Pa. The low <b>acid</b> <b>Tank</b> 40 run (106 % acid stoichiometry) had the highest yield stress at 3. 78 Pa...|$|E

40|$|Savannah River Remediation (SRR) is {{preparing}} Tank 6 F for closure. The {{first step in}} preparing the tank for closure is mechanical sludge removal. In mechanical sludge removal, personnel add liquid (e. g., inhibited water or supernate salt solution) to the tank to form a slurry. They mix the liquid and sludge with pumps, and transfer the slurry to another tank for further processing. Mechanical sludge removal effectively removes {{the bulk of the}} sludge from a tank, but is not able to remove all of the sludge. In Tank 6 F, SRR estimated a sludge heel of 5, 984 gallons remained after mechanical sludge removal. To remove this sludge heel, SRR performed chemical cleaning. The chemical cleaning included two oxalic acid strikes, a spray wash, and a water wash. SRR conducted the first oxalic acid strike as follows. Personnel added 110, 830 gallons of 8 wt % oxalic <b>acid</b> to <b>Tank</b> 6 F and mixed the contents of Tank 6 F with two submersible mixer pumps (SMPs) for approximately four days. Following the mixing, they transferred 115, 903 gallons of Tank 6 F material to Tank 7 F. The SMPs were operating when the transfer started and were shut down approximately five hours after the transfer started. SRR collected a sample of the liquid from Tank 6 F and submitted it to SRNL for analysis. Mapping of the tank following the transfer indicated that 2, 400 gallons of solids remained in the tank. SRR conducted the second oxalic acid strike as follows. Personnel added 28, 881 gallons of 8 wt % oxalic <b>acid</b> to <b>Tank</b> 6 F. Following the acid addition, they visually inspected the tank and transferred 32, 247 gallons of Tank 6 F material to Tank 7 F. SRR collected a sample of the liquid from Tank 6 F and submitted it to SRNL for analysis. Mapping of the tank following the transfer indicated that 3, 248 gallons of solids remained in the tank. Following the oxalic acid strikes, SRR performed Spray Washing with oxalic acid to remove waste collected on internal structures, cooling coils, tank top internals, and <b>tank</b> walls. The <b>Acid</b> Spray Wash was followed by a Water Spray Wash to remove oxalic <b>acid</b> from the <b>tank</b> internals. SRR conducted the Spray Wash as follows. Personnel added 4, 802 gallons of 8 wt % oxalic <b>acid</b> to <b>Tank</b> 6 F through the spray mast installed in Riser 2, added 4, 875 gallons of oxalic acid through Riser 7, added 5, 000 gallons of deionized water into the tank via Riser 2, and 5, 000 gallons of deionized water into the tank via Riser 7. Following the Spray Wash, they visually inspected the tank and transferred 22, 430 gallons of Tank 6 F material to Tank 7 F. SRR collected a sample of the liquid from Tank 6 F and submitted it to SRNL for analysis. Following the Spray Wash and transfer, Savannah River Site (SRS) added 113, 935 gallons of well water to Tank 6 F. They mixed the tank contents with a single SMP and transferred 112, 699 gallons from Tank 6 F to Tank 7 F. SRR collected a sample of the liquid from Tank 6 F and submitted to SRNL for analysis. Mapping of the tank following the transfer indicated that 3, 488 gallons of solids remained in the tank.

Membrane distillation technology replaces the dryer to enrich the glutamic acid neutralizer, and improves the concentration of sodium glutamate in the glutamic acid neutralizer. The membrane distillation flux of glutamic acid neutralizer changes along the concentration multiple curve. It shows that with concentration up to 60 %，the glutamic acid neutralizer will supersaturate when crystal comes up and the membrane distillation can't go on. The color and conductivity of product water suggest that some volatile substances are formed. Peak time difference between glutamate filtrate gas chromatography and product water of the membrane distillated glutamic acid neutralizer does not exceed 0. 1 min, and thus indicates that four volatile substances from product water are derived from glutamic acid filtrate.

40|$|Glycolic acid {{is being}} {{evaluated}} {{as an alternative}} for formic and nitric acid in the DWPF flowsheet. Demonstration testing and modeling for this new flowsheet has shown that glycolic acid and glycolate has a potential to remain in certain streams generated during {{the production of the}} nuclear waste glass. A literature review was conducted {{to assess the impact of}} glycolic acid on the corrosion of the materials of construction for the DWPF facility as well as facilities downstream which may have residual glycolic acid and glycolates present. The literature data was limited to solutions containing principally glycolic acid. The reported corrosion rates and degradation characteristics have shown the following for the materials of construction.  For C 276 alloy, the primary material of construction for the CPC vessels, corrosion rates of either 2 or 20 mpy were reported up to a temperature of 93 C.  For the austenitic stainless steels, 304 L and 316 L, variable rates were reported over a range of temperatures, varying from 2 mpy up to 200 mpy (at 100 C).  For 690, G 30, Allcorr, Ultimet and Stellite alloys no data were available.  For relevant polymers where data are available, the data suggests that exposure to glycolic acid is not detrimental. The literature data had limited application to the DWPF process since only the storage and feed vessels, pumps and piping used to handle the glycolic acid are directly covered by the available data. These components are either 304 L or 316 L alloys for which the literature data is inconsistent (See Bullet 2 above). Corrosion rates in pure glycolic acid solutions also are not representative of the DWPF process streams. This stream is complex and contains aggressive species, i. e. chlorides, sulfates, mercury, as well as antifoaming agents which cumulatively have an unknown effect on the corrosion rates of the materials of construction. Therefore, testing is recommended to investigate any synergistic effects of the aggressive species and to verify the performance of materials in the key process vessels as well as downstream vessels and processes such as the evaporator where heating is occurring. The following testing would provide data for establishing the viability of these components.  Electrochemical testing - evaluate the corrosion rate and susceptibility to localized corrosion within the SRAT, SME, OGCT, Quencher and Evaporator. Testing would be conducted at operational temperatures in simulants with ranges of glycolic acid, iron, chloride, sulfate, mercury, and antifoaming agents.  Hot-wall testing – evaluate the corrosion under heat transfer conditions to simulate those for heating coils and evaporator coil surfaces. Testing would be at nominal chemistries with concentration of glycolic acid, chloride, sulfate and mercury at high expected concentrations. Some tests would be performed with antifoaming agents.  Melter coupon testing – evaluate the performance of alloy 690 in melter feeds containing glycolic acid. This testing would be conducted as part of the melter flammability testing.  Polymer testing – evaluate changes in polymer properties in immersion testing with DWPF simulants to provide product-specific data for service life evaluation and analyze the Hansen solubility parameters for relevant polymers in glycolic vs. formic acid. During this literature review process, the difficulties associated with measuring the liquid level in formic <b>acid</b> <b>tanks</b> were revealed. A test is recommended to resolve this issue prior to the introduction of glycolic acid into the DWPF. This testing would evaluate the feasibility of using ultrasonic inspection techniques to determine liquid level and other desirable attributes of glycolic acid in DWPF storage tanks and related equipment...|$|R
40|$|Industrial {{wastewater}} {{with very}} high Total Organic Carbon (TOC) {{is a potential}} substrate for anaerobic treatment. Continuous Flow Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) is the common model of reactor used to treat various kind of wastewater. Development and modification on digester type is still ongoing till this day. The most noted modification in anaerobic reactor and mostly used {{in the world today}} is Up-flow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactor. The main focus of this study is on calculating the design that suitable for treating glycol and organic acid based industrial wastewater. The wastewater is predicted to have total Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) of 50 kgCOD/m 3 to 100 kgCOD/ m 3 and wide range of salinity. Two models of anaerobic reactor were compared and their parameters calculated based on initial data of the wastewater, Anaerobic Contact reactor and UASB reactor. Influent COD total is assumed to be pre-treated to remove particulate COD, thus COD inlet has nearly 100 % soluble COD. The influent COD is set at 70 kgCOD/m 3 and flow rate of wastewater at 150 m 3 /d. Two digester tanks were calculated for Anaerobic Contact reactor, where <b>Acid</b> phase <b>tank</b> has 1526 m 3 volume and Gas phase tank has 5941 m 3. The UASB reactor was split into 4 unit tanks with digester volume at 636 m 3. An external recirculation pump is required to control the up-flow velocity of the UASB. Both of the anaerobic models are predicted to have daily maximum methane production at 4130 m 3 /day with energy production rate of 131. 3 GJ/day. Costs of the biogas construction were calculated based on its constituent materials. The estimated cost of equipment generation for Anaerobic Contact digester and UASB is 17, 237, 528. 90 Kr and 7, 907, 535. 00 Kr, respectively. The Anaerobic Contact reactor becomes the feasible model for treating the industrial wastewater with high COD concentration based on its ability to withstand shock of wastewater load...|$|R
40|$|In closed {{recirculating}} systems, a {{particulate matter}} consisting of bacteria, algae, fungi, and detritus develops spontaneously. This microbial floc {{can serve as}} a high-protein food source for finfish and shellfish and has the potential to supplement the protein required in shrimp feed. To advance the use of microbial floc as a feed supplement, it is necessary to manipulate its microbial components, which requires thorough characterization of the bacterial components. Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, were raised in a closed recirculating system, and water was compared to the contents of shrimp foreguts and hindguts. Water consistently contained less microbial biomass than did shrimp guts, but 16 S rDNA sequences indicated that water was more diverse than shrimp guts. Phylogenetic analysis of 16 S rDNA sequences retrieved from water and shrimp foregut grouped these sequences into various unrelated generic clusters. Fatty acid analysis demonstrated that shrimp feed was not a major contributor of microbial fatty <b>acids</b> to shrimp <b>tanks,</b> as the feed mostly contained polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are typically found only in eukaryotes. It is hoped that elucidating more details about the various components of microbial floc will help in understanding its development and will lead to its use as a high-protein feed supplement...|$|R
40|$|Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) {{evaluated}} {{methods to}} mix and blend {{the contents of the}} blend tanks to ensure the contents are properly blended before they are transferred from the blend tank such as Tank 21 and Tank 24 to the Salt Waste Processing Facility (SWPF) feed tank. The tank contents consist of three forms: dissolved salt solution, other waste salt solutions, and sludge containing settled solids. This paper focuses on developing the computational model and estimating the operation time of submersible slurry pump when the tank contents are adequately blended prior to their transfer to the SWPF facility. A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics approach was taken by using the full scale configuration of SRS Type-IV tank, Tank 21 H. Major solid obstructions such as the tank wall boundary, the transfer pump column, and three slurry pump housings including one active and two inactive pumps were included in the mixing performance model. Basic flow pattern results predicted by the computational model were benchmarked against the SRNL test results and literature data. Tank 21 is a waste tank that is used to prepare batches of salt feed for SWPF. The salt feed must be a homogeneous solution satisfying the acceptance criterion of the solids entrainment during transfer operation. The work scope described here consists of two modeling areas. They are the steady state flow pattern calculations before the addition of <b>acid</b> solution for <b>tank</b> blending operation and the transient mixing analysis during miscible liquid blending operation. The transient blending calculations were performed by using the 95 % homogeneity criterion for the entire liquid domain of the tank. The initial conditions for the entire modeling domain were based on the steady-state flow pattern results with zero second phase concentration. The performance model was also benchmarked against the SRNL test results and literature data...|$|R
40|$|The {{initial phase}} of bulk waste removal {{operations}} was recently completed in Tank 5 F. Video {{inspection of the}} tank indicates several mounds of sludge still remain in the tank. Additionally, a mound of white solids was observed under Riser 5. In support of chemical cleaning and heel removal programs, samples of the sludge and the mound of white solids {{were obtained from the}} tank for characterization and testing. A core sample of the sludge and Super Snapper sample of the white solids were characterized. A supernate dip sample from Tank 7 F was also characterized. A portion of the sludge was used in two tank cleaning tests using oxalic acid at 50 C and 75 C. The filtered oxalic <b>acid</b> from the <b>tank</b> cleaning tests was subsequently neutralized by addition to a simulated Tank 7 F supernate. Solids and liquid samples from the tank cleaning test and neutralization test were characterized. A separate report documents the results of the gas generation from the tank cleaning test using oxalic <b>acid</b> and <b>Tank</b> 5 F sludge. The characterization results for the Tank 5 F sludge sample (FTF- 05 - 06 - 55) appear quite good with respect to the tight precision of the sample replicates, good results for the glass standards, and minimal contamination found in the blanks and glass standards. The aqua regia and sodium peroxide fusion data also show good agreement between the two dissolution methods. Iron dominates the sludge composition with other major contributors being uranium, manganese, nickel, sodium, aluminum, and silicon. The low sodium value for the sludge reflects the absence of supernate present in the sample due to the core sampler employed for obtaining the sample. The XRD and CSEM results for the Super Snapper salt sample (i. e., white solids) from Tank 5 F (FTF- 05 - 07 - 1) indicate the material contains hydrated sodium carbonate and bicarbonate salts along with some aluminum hydroxide. These compounds likely precipitated from the supernate in the tank. A solubility test showed the material to be water-soluble consistent with the determined composition. The analytical data for the solid residues filtered from the oxalic acid solution and filtered oxalic acid indicate {{a large portion of the}} Tank 5 F sludge used in the tank cleaning test dissolved into the oxalic acid. The results of a material balance calculation indicate a high percentage of the iron, uranium, sodium, and aluminum dissolved during both tests. Approximately half of the manganese, a small portion of the plutonium, and essentially none of the nickel dissolved during the tank cleaning tests. Additionally, the results show slightly higher dissolution of the sludge in the 75 C test compared to the 50 C test however, the amount of sludge dissolution gained by using the higher temperature remains small. Some uncertainty remains with respect to the amount of plutonium dissolved in the tank cleaning test. The neutralization of the filtered oxalic acid solutions from the cleaning test produced a large volume of solids ({approx} 2 X the original sludge mass after filtration and air drying). A large portion of the increase in solids could be attributed to the formation of sodium oxalate. The data from analysis of the solid residues filtered from the neutralization tests and the filtrate obtained indicate most of the iron, uranium, manganese, and a large portion of the aluminum precipitated during the neutralization tests. The data for the 50 C test and the 75 C test show good agreement with the exception of the amount of aluminum precipitated from the neutralization. The slower addition rate of the oxalic acid filtrate to the simulated Tank 7 F supernate in the 75 C test might account for the smaller amount of aluminum precipitated and differences in the particle size/morphology and composition of the particulates. Some evidence of uranium separation from other sludge elements appears in the 75 C data. Data collected from the tank cleaning and neutralization tests indicates most of the uranium dissolved during the cleaning test with oxalic acid along with the iron, aluminum, and sodium in the sludge. During the neutralization of the oxalic acid, the majority of the uranium precipitates from solution along with the iron and other typical sludge elements. The CSEM results of the 75 C neutralization test provide some evidence of uranium separation from other sludge elements. However, the CSEM analysis looked at a very small amount of sample, which might not be representative of the bulk material and the sludge sample also showed areas of high uranium concentration. Additionally, how the test results will scale to the full-scale neutralization in a waste tank remains uncertain. The analysis of the oxalic acid filtrates indicates that only a small portion of the plutonium dissolved during the tank cleaning test. However, the analytical data from the solid residues filtered from the cleaning test contradict the solution data and indicate approximately half of the plutonium dissolved...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{describes a}} model for condensation of sulfuric acid aerosol given an initial concentration and/or source of gaseous sulfur trioxide (e. g. fuming from oleum). The model includes the thermochemical effects on aerosol condensation and air parcel buoyancy. Condensation is assumed to occur heterogeneously onto a preexisting background aerosol distribution. The model development is both a revisiting of research initially presented at the Fall 2001 American Geophysical Union Meeting [1] and a further extension to provide new capabilities for current atmospheric dispersion modeling efforts [2]. Sulfuric acid {{is one of the}} most widely used of all industrial chemicals. In 1992, world consumption of sulfuric acid was 145 million metric tons, with 42. 4 Mt (mega-tons) consumed in the United States [10]. In 2001, of 37. 5 Mt consumed in the U. S., 74 % went into producing phosphate fertilizers [11]. Another significant use is in mining industries. Lawuyi and Fingas [7] estimate that, in 1996, 68 % of use was for fertilizers and 5. 8 % was for mining. They note that H{sub 2 }SO{sub 4 } use has been and should continue to be very stable. In the United States, the elimination of MTBE (methyl tertiary-butyl ether) and the use of ethanol for gasoline production are further increasing the demand for petroleum alkylate. Alkylate producers have a choice of either a hydrofluoric acid or sulfuric acid process. Both processes are widely used today. Concerns, however, over the safety or potential regulation of hydrofluoric acid are likely to result in most of the growth being for the sulfuric acid process, further increasing demand [11]. The implication of sulfuric acid being a pervasive industrial chemical is that transport is also pervasive. Often, this is in the form of oleum tankers, having around 30 % free sulfur trioxide. Although sulfuric acid itself is not a volatile substance, fuming sulfuric acid (referred to as oleum) is [7], the volatile product being sulfur trioxide. Sulfate aerosols and mist may form in the atmosphere on tank rupture. From chemical spill data from 1990 - 1996, Lawuyi 02 and Fingas [7] prioritize sulfuric acid as sixth most serious. During this period, they note 155 spills totaling 13 Mt, out of a supply volume of 3700 Mt. Lawuyi and Fingas [7] summarize information on three major sulfuric acid spills. On 12 February 1984, 93 tons of sulfuric acid were spilled when 14 railroad cars derailed near MacTier, Parry Sound, Ontario. On 13 December 1978, 51 railroad cars derailed near Springhill, Nova Scotia. One car, containing 93 % sulfuric acid, ruptured, spilling nearly its entire contents. In July 1993, 20 to 50 tons of fuming sulfuric acid spilled at the General Chemical Corp. plant in Richmond, California, a major industrial center near San Francisco. The release occurred when oleum was being loaded into a nonfuming <b>acid</b> railroad <b>tank</b> car that contained only a rupture disk as a safety device. The tank car was overheated and this rupture disk blew. The resulting cloud of sulfuric acid drifted northeast with prevailing winds over a number of populated areas. More than 3, 000 people subsequently sought medical attention for burning eyes, coughing, headaches, and nausea. Almost all were treated and released on the day of the spill. By the day after the release, another 5, 000 people had sought medical attention. The spill forced the closure of five freeways in the region as well as some Bay Area Rapid Transit System stations. Apart from corrosive toxicity, there is the additional hazard that the reactions of sulfur trioxide and sulfuric acid vapors with water are extremely exothermic [10, 11]. While the vapors are intrinsically denser than air, there is thus the likelihood of strong, warming-induced buoyancy from reactions with ambient water vapor, water-containing aerosol droplets, and wet environmental surface. Nordin [12] relates just such an occurrence following the Richmond, CA spill, with the plume observed to rise to 300 m. For all practical purposes, sulfur trioxide was the constituent released from the heated tank car. The behavior of the resulting plume suggested that initially sulfur trioxide behaved as a dense gas, but the chemical reacted with air humidity, producing sulfuric acid and heat. The heat caused the plume to rise. Eventually the plume cooled, resulting in sulfuric acid descending towards people on the ground. This kind of behavior is not accounted for in the popular gas dispersion models. In the presence of complex terrain, such heat induced buoyancy could enable a sulfur trioxide cloud to leap local drainage boundaries with a single bound. Unless there were insufficient water/humidity to fully react with the SO{sub 3 } and H{sub 2 }SO{sub 4 } on the first ascent, no secondary bounds would be expected, the cloud then behaving as a heavy tracer until sufficiently diluted...|$|R
40|$|Dairy {{farmers in}} the Northeastern Unites States are paid based {{on the amount of}} fat and protein in their cows 2 ̆ 7 milk, and {{improving}} fat and protein production is linked with improved financial sustainability for dairy farms. However, not all farmers are motivated to make changes to increase milk fat and protein production. Previous research has identified a positive correlation between a group of fatty acids, known as the de novo fatty acids, and the fat and protein content of bulk tank milk from commercial dairy farms. Therefore, the first objective of this research was to explore the relationship of farm management, the cow 2 ̆ 7 s diet, and lactation performance with de novo fatty acid content on Northeastern US dairy farms. Results from the first objective were communicated with dairy farmers; therefore, the second objective was to understand how to communicate with farmers to influence their behavior. We hypothesized that farms with high de novo fatty <b>acids</b> in bulk <b>tank</b> milk would manage and feed their cows to optimize rumen fermentation conditions. The first (Chapter 2) and second (Chapter 3) studies were methodologically very similar. Farms were categorized as either high de novo (HDN) or low de novo (LDN) based on the concentration of de novo fatty acids in their bulk tank milk for the 6 months prior to the farm visit. Farms were then visited once in March or April, 2014 (Chapter 2) or between February and April, 2015 (Chapter 3) to assess management practices and collect samples of the cows 2 ̆ 7 diet. There were no differences in days in milk in Chapter 2 or Chapter 3. Yield of milk, fat, and true protein per cow were higher for HDN versus LDN farms in Chapter 2. In both chapters, HDN farms had higher milk fat and true protein content and higher de novo fatty acid yield per day. The HDN farms had lower freestall stocking density in Chapter 2 and provided more feedbunk space per cow in Chapter 3. Additionally, tiestall feeding frequency was higher for HDN than LDN farms. No differences were detected for dietary chemical composition, except ether extract was lower for HDN than LDN farms in both chapters. Chapter 4 explored how to communicate the results of Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 through eleven qualitative, semi-structured interviews and insight from the 83 farm visits. Farmers identified the cooperative, expert consultants (nutritionist, veterinarian, and agronomists), financial advisers, print publications, and other farmers as principal sources of information. However, barriers to the transfer of information included family dynamics, lack of access to high speed internet, and difficulties evaluating divergent recommendations from experts. Several farmers expressed an incorrect perception of their farms 2 ̆ 7 fat and protein production compared with cooperative averages which reduced their motivation to incorporate management changes. Recommendations to overcome these barriers include integrating management team meetings and facilitating informal discussion groups between farmers. This research is correlational in nature, and future research is needed to verify a causal relationship between de novo fatty acids and milk fat and protein content. However, the results of this research can be used to help farmers increase their cows 2 ̆ 7 milk fat and protein content, improve the transfer of knowledge to dairy farmers, and ultimately support the financial sustainability of dairy farms in the Northeastern US...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{involves a}} combined experimental modeling study that builds on our previous DOE-sponsored work in understanding how KMnO 4 {{can be used}} with in situ cleanups of contaminated sites. The specific objectives of this study are (1) to describe how solid forms of KMnO 4 behave in saturated media, (2) to undertake flow tank studies that examine the hydraulic impact of reaction products (especially MnO 2) on the flux of water through the zone of contamination, and (3) to represent process understanding in flow and transport models. We have made excellent progress in addressing these issues through a variety of different laboratory and theoretical investigations, as well as work that summarizes the state of the science. In the space available for this report, we can only summarize the key findings of the study. Readers interested in additional details can refer to the papers that are listed at end of this report. There has been significant industrial interest in the use of KMnO 4 schemes for the in situ destruction of various chlorinated solvents. Given our previous work that emphasized some of the problems associated with field applications of the method, we were invited to contribute to a special edition of Environmental & Engineering Geoscience that examined the effects of heterogeneity on in situ remediation schemes. Our review targeted the most common implementation namely the use of an injection/withdrawal system to circulate oxidants (e. g., potassium permanganate, hydrogen peroxide, and Fenton's Reagent) through a source zone containing a dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL). The review demonstrated with various examples (1) how the efficiency of chemical oxidation is highly dependent on physical and chemical heterogeneities, and (2) how effective delivery is essential for successful remediation. A summary of this work is provided here in Section 1 of the Chapter Methods and Results. We investigated the mineralogy of Mn oxides, and the possibilities of controlling the colloid growth and removing the solid precipitates by dissolution. We determined the chemical formula of the Mn oxide and identified as semi-amorphous potassium-rich birnessite. We also measured the surface properties of the Mn oxide like the specific surface area and point of zero charge (pzc) of the Mn oxide. These findings provide foundation for further investigation of the behavior of Mn oxide precipitates in the remediation environment. We utilized batch experiments to explore the feasibility of applying phosphate to slow down the formation of colloidal Mn oxide. Our results show that phosphate can slow down the formation of the colloids, especially early in the reaction. A model was proposed to describe the reaction process. Our study provides scientific background on the possibility to slow down the formation of colloid during the oxidation scheme by chemical additives. The dissolution kinetics of Mn oxide was evaluated in batch experiments using solutions of citric acid, oxalic acid, and EDTA. Organic acids dissolve Mn oxide quickly. Reaction rates increase with acid concentration, as tested with citric acid. The Mn oxide dissolution mechanism likely involves proton and ligand-promoted dissolution and reductive dissolution. We proposed two models describing the dissolution of Mn oxide by organic <b>acids.</b> The flow <b>tank</b> experiment confirmed the possibilities of restoring permeability damaged by Mn oxide precipitation. There seem to be good possibilities for using citrate and oxalate to control plugging created by the precipitation of Mn oxide. A more details summary of the work on the Mn oxide precipitates is provided here in Section 2 of the Chapter Methods and Results. Another important thrust of our research effort involved a detailed evaluation of the efficiency of TCE removal with time, and the space/time dynamics of the solid-phase oxidation reaction front (Section 3 of the Chapter Methods and Results). The approach involved a very large 3 -D flow tank experiment. The progress of TCE destruction and the distribution of MnO 2 precipitates were monitored using novel optical and chemical monitoring techniques. The results showed that the efficiency of the KMnO 4 treatment of chlorinated solvents in the flushing scheme diminished with time due to the formation of low-permeability reaction zones in the TCE source and along the downstream edge of the TCE plume...|$|R
