The optimum orders estimated from the BIC reliably decreased during anaesthetic-induced unconsciousness, as opposed to AIC estimates, and, thus, successfully tracked the loss of awareness.

Indigenous water well maintenance and government initiated rainwater harvesting are two important collective actions common among these communities. With the aim of examining collective action institutions in both cases, we collected data from different stakeholders and individual members. Theoretically, low level of physical assets (action resource) limits participation of an individual in collective action. In our case, other factors such as environmental uncertainty and lower level of dependence on the resource {{have been found to}} be more significant in limiting membership than limitation of assets. Poor agropastoralists depend on their informal networks to have access to other assets. This enables them to maintain their membership. Moreover, there is a difference between self-organized and imposed collective action in terms of rule enforcement and sanctioning. Institutions also produce different incentives in that free riding leads to <b>automatic</b> <b>exclusion</b> in water harvesting, whereas poor free riding members continue benefiting from the water well. In evaluating the success, we conclude that technical capacity of members in benefiting from their collective action is limited and deserves more attention than their ability to develop effective collective action institutions.

Specific drugs—older generationTeratogenicity of phenobarbitone (PB), phenytoin (PHT), valproate (VPA) and carbamazepine (CBZ) is acknowledged, with drugs, such as trimethadione, being removed from the market because of teratogenicity. Specific drugs—new generationInsufficient data allowed definitive commentary concerning teratogenicity of newer AEM, such as lamotrigine (LTG), gabapentin (GBP), tiagabine (TGB) or levetiracetam (LEV).

In humans, GlyRs are assembled as homo- or heteromeric pentamers of α 1 - 3 and β subunits. GlyR malfunctions {{have been linked to}} a range of neurological disorders including hyperekplexia, temporal lobe epilepsy, autism, breathing disorders, and chronic inflammatory pain. Although it is possible that GlyRs may eventually be clinically targeted for a variety of neurological disorders, most research to date has focused on developing GlyR-targeted treatments for chronic pain. Inflammatory pain sensitization is caused by inflammatory mediators downregulating the magnitude of α 3 GlyR-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents in spinal nociceptive neurons. Consistent with this paradigm, it is now well established that the selective enhancement of α 3 GlyR current magnitude is effective in alleviating inflammatory pain. In this review, we briefly describe the physiological roles and pharmacological properties of GlyRs. We then outline the methods commonly used to discover new GlyR-active compounds and review recent progress, in our laboratory and elsewhere, in developing GlyR-targeted analgesics. We conclude that the eventual development of an α 3 GlyR-targeted analgesic is an eminently feasible goal. However, in selecting or designing new therapeutic leads, we caution against the <b>automatic</b> <b>exclusion</b> of compounds with potentiating effects on α 1 GlyRs.

40|$|Abstract Background Structure elucidation {{of unknown}} small {{molecules}} by mass spectrometry {{is a challenge}} despite advances in instrumentation. The first crucial step is to obtain correct elemental compositions. In order to automatically constrain the thousands of possible candidate structures, rules {{need to be developed}} to select the most likely and chemically correct molecular formulas. Results An algorithm for filtering molecular formulas is derived from seven heuristic rules: (1) restrictions for the number of elements, (2) LEWIS and SENIOR chemical rules, (3) isotopic patterns, (4) hydrogen/carbon ratios, (5) element ratio of nitrogen, oxygen, phosphor, and sulphur versus carbon, (6) element ratio probabilities and (7) presence of trimethylsilylated compounds. Formulas are ranked according to their isotopic patterns and subsequently constrained by presence in public chemical databases. The seven rules were developed on 68, 237 existing molecular formulas and were validated in four experiments. First, 432, 968 formulas covering five million PubChem database entries were checked for consistency. Only 0. 6 % of these compounds did not pass all rules. Next, the rules were shown to effectively reducing the complement all eight billion theoretically possible C, H, N, S, O, P-formulas up to 2000 Da to only 623 million most probable elemental compositions. Thirdly 6, 000 pharmaceutical, toxic and natural compounds were selected from DrugBank, TSCA and DNP databases. The correct formulas were retrieved as top hit at 80 – 99 % probability when assuming data acquisition with complete resolution of unique compounds and 5 % absolute isotope ratio deviation and 3 ppm mass accuracy. Last, some exemplary compounds were analyzed by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry and by gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry. In each case, the correct formula was ranked as top hit when combining the seven rules with database queries. Conclusion The seven rules enable an <b>automatic</b> <b>exclusion</b> of molecular formulas which are either wrong or which contain unlikely high or low number of elements. The correct molecular formula is assigned with a probability of 98 % if the formula exists in a compound database. For truly novel compounds that are not present in databases, the correct formula is found in the first three hits with a probability of 65 – 81 %.

40|$|The Supreme Court’s {{judgment}} in R. v. Singh, released in 2007, settled the controversy regarding {{the scope of}} the Charter-enshrined section 7 right to silence in the context of custodial police questioning. The Court’s earlier decisions in R. v. Hebert (1990) and R. v. Oickle (2000) combined to raise questions about the interplay between the common law confessions rule and the Charter right to silence. Singh’s response was to cast the m as functional equivalents. Although the Court’s earlier jurisprudence may have seemed to suggest otherwise, Singh declared that there is no scope to argue that police conduct, in “persuading” a detainee to speak, can violate section 7 principles if it is found that such conduct did not overcome the choice of the detainee to speak under the confessions rule. Singh affords a high degree of tolerance to police conduct directed at persuading or influencing a detainee to speak. an extraordinary premium has been placed on state investigative interests in the context of post-arrest interrogation. In different contexts considered by the Court in past cases, the accused’s interest against self-conscription has prevailed in recognition of the central importance of the principle against self-incrimination to the criminal law. The current strictures of the section 24 (2) analysis — which effectively provides for an <b>automatic</b> rule of <b>exclusion</b> for conscriptive evidence obtained pursuant to a Charter breach — may account for the Court’s relatively narrow construction of the section 7 right to silence in relation to detained statements. Since Singh has eliminated any elbow room for section 7 once the voluntariness of a statement has been determined, we can expect to see changes in the focus of arguments for exclusion. For instance, greater attention will likely be paid to the personal circumstances and characteristics of individual accused in appraising the effect of persistent police interrogation. Another likely trend will be arguments for the exclusion of self-incriminating statements that are framed under the right to counsel...|$|R
40|$|Humans {{are experts}} at {{understanding}} what they see. Similarity and analogy {{play a significant}} role in making sense of the visual world by forming analogies to similar images encountered previously. Yet, while these acts of visual reasoning may be commonplace, the processes of visual analogy are not yet well understood. In this dissertation, I investigate the utility of representing visual information in a fractal manner for computing visual similarity and analogy. In particular, I develop a computational technique of fractal reasoning for addressing problems of visual similarity and novelty. I illustrate the effectiveness of fractal reasoning on problems of visual similarity and analogy on the Raven’s Progressive Matrices and Miller’s Analogies tests of intelligence, problems of visual novelty and oddity on the Odd One Out test of intelligence, and problems of visual similarity and oddity on the Dehaene test of core geometric reasoning. I show that the performance of my computational model on these various tests is comparable to human performance. Fractal reasoning provides a new method for computing answers to such problems. Specifically, I show that the choice of the level of abstraction of problem representation determines the degree to which an answer may be regarded as confident, and that that choice of abstraction may be controlled automatically by the algorithm as a means of seeking that confident answer. This emergence of ambiguity and its remedy via problem re-representation is afforded by the fractal representation. I also show how reasoning over sparse data (at coarse levels of abstraction) or homogeneous data (at finest levels of abstraction) could both drive the <b>automatic</b> <b>exclusion</b> of certain levels of abstraction, as well as provide a signal to shift the analogical reasoning from consideration of simple analogies (such as analogies between pairs of objects) to more complex analogies (such as analogies among triplets, or larger groups of objects). My dissertation also explores fractal reasoning in perception, including both biologically-inspired imprinting and bistable perception. In particular, it provides a computational explanation of bistable perception in the famous Necker cube problem that is directly tied to the process of determining a confident interpretation via re-representation. Thus, my research makes two primary contributions to AI theories of visual similarity and analogy. The first contribution is the Extended Analogy By Recall (ABR*) algorithm, the computational technique for visual reasoning that automatically adjusts fractal representations to an appropriate level of abstraction. The second contribution is the fractal representation itself, a knowledge representation that add the notion of self-similarity and re-representation to analogy making. Ph. D...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} jurisdictions have {{fastened}} onto a 2 ̆ 2 solution 2 ̆ 2 {{that appears to}} reconcile respect for refugee law with the determination of states to rid themselves quickly of potentially violent asylum seekers. Courts in these states have been persuaded {{that a person who}} has committed or facilitated acts of violence may lawfully be denied a refugee status hearing under a clause of the Refugee Convention that authorizes the <b>automatic</b> <b>exclusion</b> of persons whom the government reasonably believes are international or extraditable criminals. Refugee law so interpreted is reconcilable with even fairly blunt measures for the exclusion of violent asylum seekers. In our view, this approach is doctrinally unsound and rife with critical risks for genuine refugees. The Refugee Convention as originally conceived fairly meets the legitimate needs of both refugees and the communities that receive them. Refugee law does not ignore the security interests of asylum countries, but refuses to allow those interests to run roughshod over the equally urgent need of persons at risk of persecution to secure entry to a place of safety. Two parts of the Refugee Convention are relevant. The mechanism now increasingly invoked to justify bars on the entry of asylum seekers associated with acts of violence is Article 1 (F). This clause requires governments to deny refugee status to any person reasonably regarded as either an international criminal or a fugitive from domestic criminal justice, the person 2 ̆ 7 s fear of persecution notwithstanding. As elaborated below, this mechanism for 2 ̆ 2 peremptory exclusion 2 ̆ 2 is predicated on the satisfaction of an external and clearly defined standard of international or extraditable criminality. Only persons who meet this standard are deemed inherently unworthy of Convention refugee status and thus subject to exclusion without full consideration of the merits of their refugee claim. The rationale for Article 1 (F) is not the protection of asylum-state safety and security interests (although it may sometimes be an ancillary result of peremptory exclusion). Concerns about threats to the safety and security of an asylum state should be factored into the protection decision, instead, through an exception to the duty of states not to expose a refugee to the risk of return to persecution, the duty of non-refoulement. Article 33 (2) of the Convention authorizes a government to refuse to protect a refugee whose presence threatens its most basic interests. A receiving state may even return a dangerous refugee to face the risk of persecution in his or her state of origin, but only if the risk to national security or communal safety is established {{on the basis of a}} more demanding standard of proof. [ [...] . ] While insisting on precision in the interpretation of international refugee law, our point is emphatically not that states should open their doors to persons whose engagement in or advocacy of violence threatens the safety of the host-state community. But neither should governments disregard the balanced approach to those concerns, which they have enacted into international law. The Refugee Convention is a supple instrument, capable of meeting the challenges of the new world disorder. For both principled and pragmatic reasons, this Article emphasizes the importance of not confusing international criminals 2 ̆ 7 and legal fugitives 2 ̆ 7 exclusion from refugee status with measured efforts to defend the safety and security of communities that receive refugees.
