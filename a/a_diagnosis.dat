50|$|In medicine, <b>a</b> {{differential}} <b>diagnosis</b> is the distinguishing of {{a particular}} disease or condition from others that present similar clinical features. Differential diagnostic procedures are used by physicians and other trained medical professionals to diagnose the specific disease in a patient, or, at least, to eliminate any imminently life-threatening conditions. Often, each individual option of a possible disease is called <b>a</b> differential <b>diagnosis</b> (for example, bronchitis could be <b>a</b> differential <b>diagnosis</b> {{in the evaluation of}} a cough that ends up with <b>a</b> final <b>diagnosis</b> of common cold).|$|R

40|$|To {{estimate}} {{the rate of}} hospitalized eye trauma in Taiwan and investigate the role between principal and secondary diagnoses of such trauma. Nationwide fixed cohort study of 1, 000, 000 beneficiaries from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Database was used and 4819 patients who were hospitalized for eye trauma during 1996 - 2010 were analyzed. During 1996 - 2010, the incidence rates of hospitalized eye trauma (per 100 000 person-years) were 35. 0 (95 % confidence interval (CI), 34. 0 to 36. 0) for total diagnosis, 9. 8 (95 % CI, 9. 3 to 10. 3) for <b>a</b> principal <b>diagnosis,</b> and 25. 3 (95 % CI, 24. 4 to 26. 1) for <b>a</b> secondary <b>diagnosis.</b> The sex risk ratio was 3. 1 for <b>a</b> principal <b>diagnosis</b> and 2. 1 for <b>a</b> secondary <b>diagnosis.</b> The main causes of eye trauma were traffic accident, work accident, assault (among males < 60 years of age), and falls (among elderly men and women). The proportion admitted to an ophthalmic department among those with <b>a</b> principal <b>diagnosis</b> of eye trauma (64. 8 %) {{was significantly higher than}} among those with <b>a</b> secondary <b>diagnosis</b> (2. 3 %) (p<. 0001).

5|$|DVT {{diagnosis}} {{requires the}} use of imaging devices such as ultrasound. Clinical assessments, which predict DVT likelihood, can help determine if a D-dimer test is useful. In those not highly likely to have DVT, a normal D-dimer result can rule out <b>a</b> <b>diagnosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Features that {{differentiate}} {{an animal}} from {{most or all}} others are called <b>a</b> <b>diagnosis.</b> Some, but not all, of the features in <b>a</b> <b>diagnosis</b> are also autapomorphies.

5|$|According to St Petersburg {{psychiatrist}} Vladimir Pshizov, {{with regard}} to punitive psychiatry, the nature of psychiatry is of such a sort that using psychiatrists against opponents of authorities is always tempting for the authorities, because it is seemingly possible not {{to take into account}} an opinion by the person who received <b>a</b> <b>diagnosis.</b> Therefore, the issue will always remain relevant.

Most commercial immunoassays for the benzodiazepine class of drugs cross-react with alprazolam, but confirmation and quantitation is usually performed using chromatographic techniques.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Understanding {{the cause}} of patients’ {{symptoms}} often requires identifying <b>a</b> pathological <b>diagnosis.</b> <b>A</b> single-center study found that many patients discharged from the emergency department (ED) do not receive <b>a</b> pathological <b>diagnosis.</b> We analyzed 17 years of data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) to identify the proportion of patients who received <b>a</b> pathological <b>diagnosis</b> at ED discharge. We hypothesized that many patients do not receive <b>a</b> pathological <b>diagnosis,</b> and {{that the proportion of}} pathological diagnoses increased between 1993 and 2009. Methods: Using the NHAMCS data from 1993 - 2009, we analyzed visits of patients age ≥ 18 years, discharged from the ED, who had presented with the three most common chief complaints: chest pain, abdominal pain, and headache. Discharge diagnoses were coded as symptomatic versus pathological based on a pre-defined coding system. We compared weighted annual proportions of pathological discharge diagnoses with 95...|$|R
30|$|To {{assess the}} {{strength}} of agreement between the radiographic and clinical definitions of OA, and between radiographic and self-reported definitions of OA, sensitivity, specificity and relative risk statistics were calculated. This approach regards <b>a</b> radiographic <b>diagnosis</b> of OA as the ‘gold standard’. Sensitivity is the proportion of those with radiographic diagnosis of OA who also have <b>a</b> positive OA <b>diagnosis</b> according to the alternative definition of interest (i.e. clinical or self-reported). Specificity is the proportion of those with <b>a</b> negative radiographic <b>diagnosis</b> of OA who also have <b>a</b> negative OA <b>diagnosis</b> according to the alternative definition of interest. Relative risk (RR) is {{the ratio of the}} risk of having <b>an</b> OA <b>diagnosis</b> according to the alternative definitions of interest in individuals with and without radiographic OA.|$|R

5|$|Any {{of these}} {{conditions}} that occurs in a family can indicate <b>a</b> <b>diagnosis</b> of Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome, though it is only confirmed by a genetic test for a mutation in the FLCN gene, which codes for the protein folliculin. Though its function is not fully understood, {{it appears to be}} a tumor suppressor gene that restricts cell growth and division. Versions of FLCN have been found in other animals, including fruit flies, German shepherds, rats, and mice. The disease was discovered in 1977, but the connection with FLCN was not elucidated until 2002, after kidney cancer, collapsed lungs, and pulmonary cysts were all definitively connected to BHD.|$|E
5|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} can manifest {{similarly to}} other diseases, {{which must be}} ruled out when making <b>a</b> <b>diagnosis.</b> These include tuberous sclerosis, which causes skin lesions similar to fibrofolliculomas, and Von Hippel-Lindau disease, which causes hereditary kidney cancers. Once diagnosed, people with BHD are treated preventatively, with monitoring of kidneys and lungs using medical imaging. Fibrofolliculomas can be removed surgically and pneumothorax and kidney cancer are treated according to the normal standard of care.|$|E
5|$|Common {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of DVT include pain or tenderness, swelling, warmth, redness or discoloration, and distention of surface veins, although about half of those with the condition have no symptoms. Signs and symptoms alone are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to make <b>a</b> <b>diagnosis,</b> but when considered in conjunction with known risk factors, can help determine the likelihood of DVT. In most suspected cases, DVT is ruled out after evaluation, and symptoms are more often due to other causes, such as cellulitis, Baker's cyst, musculoskeletal injury, or lymphedema. Other differential diagnoses include hematoma, tumors, venous or arterial aneurysms, and connective tissue disorders.|$|E
40|$|The {{assumption}} that discharge diagnoses of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} and other allied conditions accurately reflect patient medical records {{was tested using}} a sample of 553 hospital discharges from the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area.

The findings were that 1 per cent of the 432 cases with <b>a</b> primary <b>diagnosis</b> in this disease category and 10 per cent of the 121 cases with <b>a</b> primary <b>diagnosis</b> of heart disease and <b>a</b> secondary <b>diagnosis</b> in this disease category were not supported by any of the selected criteria...|$|R
40|$|Many {{attempts}} have been made to combine the high diagnostic accuracy and conclusive rate of core needle biopsy (CNB) with the speed of fine needle aspiration cytology in evaluation of solid breast lesions. Multiple hybrid techniques have been developed to achieve this. We describe a cohort of patients for whom we used a relatively new, accelerated method of CNB processing, allowing for <b>a</b> definitive <b>diagnosis</b> the same day. All patients visiting the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre breast clinic during a 4 -year period were reviewed to identify all CNBs in this period performed in <b>a</b> same-day <b>diagnosis</b> track. CNB result was compared to post-operative pathology reports when available, and to follow-up when patients were not surgically treated. 1, 060 patients underwent CNB of 1, 383 lesions, 898 of which in <b>a</b> same-day <b>diagnosis</b> track with <b>a</b> sensitivity of 96. 9 % and a specificity of 99. 4 %. The inconclusive rate was 9. 2 %. For <b>a</b> same-day <b>diagnosis</b> for solid breast lesions, we could give <b>a</b> conclusive <b>diagnosis</b> with accelerated CNB processing in 65 % of our patients requiring CNB. This technique can be used reliably in <b>a</b> same-day <b>diagnosis</b> breast clinic with a very high sensitivity, specificity, and conclusive rate...|$|R
