30|$|Traffic {{policing}} <b>and</b> <b>shaping</b> algorithms {{are commonly}} used when traffic limits are known or pre-determined in advance (e.g., for enforcing compliance with a contract). The difference between policing <b>and</b> <b>shaping</b> is minor yet subtle: policing does not implement any queueing and excess packets are immediately dropped. Shaping, on the other hand, can absorb short bursts of packet, where the burst size {{is determined by the}} allocated buffer. When the buffer is full, all incoming packets are immediately dropped <b>and</b> traffic <b>shaping</b> effectively acts as traffic policing. Both policing <b>and</b> <b>shaping</b> are examples of non-work-conserving scheduling methods.|$|R

5|$|After U-3s {{arrival at}} Pola in January 1909, she was {{commissioned}} into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 12 September 1909 as SM U-3.

To alleviate the diving problems, U-3s fins were changed in size <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> several times, and eventually, the front diving planes were removed and a stationary stern flap was affixed to the hull. U-3 served as a training boat between 1910 and 1914 and made as many as ten cruises per month in that capacity.|$|E

40|$|The aim of our {{graduate}} {{work is to}} study the importance of image <b>and</b> <b>shape’s</b> in children's development and learning and also the preschool teacher’s views on image <b>and</b> <b>shapes.</b> Our research aims to explore the value of image <b>and</b> <b>shapes</b> creation <b>and</b> how it is expressed among children and in classroom activities. We are also interested in finding out how it differs from adults' views and what materials teachers use to promote the image <b>and</b> <b>shapes</b> creation in the curriculum. In our own experience, image <b>and</b> <b>shapes</b> activities are often structured differently in different curriculum activities. We therefore want to study how certain preschools work with image and form creation with children in preschool. We have performed the study through five qualitative interviews with preschool teachers and four observations on three different preschools in Stockholm. The main theory of the extension of our work is about Vygotsky's sociocultural perspective. We will find out about how according to the sociocultural perspective children can develop learning. The conclusion we have reached is that the preschool teachers interviewed seem to agree greatly with each other about how image <b>and</b> <b>shapes</b> creation affects for children's development and learning. Although there were some minor differences, for example, if the children learned by imitating each other in creative work.

5|$|Aphids such as Macrosiphum euphorbiae can {{transmit}} viral diseases which affect the colour <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> of the leaves, as can Nematodes. Up to twenty five viruses {{have been described}} as being able to infect narcissi. These include the Narcissus common latent virus (NCLV, Narcissus mottling-associated virus), Narcissus latent virus (NLV, Narcissus mild mottle virus) which causes green mottling near leaf tips, Narcissus degeneration virus (NDV), Narcissus late season yellows virus (NLSYV) which occurs after flowering, streaking the leaves and stems, Narcissus mosaic virus, Narcissus yellow stripe virus (NYSV, Narcissus yellow streak virus), Narcissus tip necrosis virus (NTNV) which produces necrosis of leaf tips after flowering and Narcissus white streak virus (NWSV).|$|E
5|$|As a hominid brain, {{the human}} brain is {{substantially}} enlarged even {{in comparison to the}} brain of a typical monkey. The sequence of human evolution from Australopithecus (four million years ago) to Homo sapiens (modern man) was marked by a steady increase in brain size. As brain size increased, this altered the size <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> of the skull, from about 600 cm3 in Homo habilis to an average of about 1520cm3 in Homo neanderthalensis. Differences in DNA, gene expression and gene–environment interactions help explain the differences between the function of {{the human brain}} and other primates.|$|E
5|$|Basil cultivars vary {{in several}} ways. Visually, the size <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> {{of the leaves}} varies greatly, from the large lettuce-like leaves of the Mammoth basil and Lettuce leaf basil to the tiny leaves of the Dwarf bush basil. More practically, the {{fragrance}} of the basil varies due to the varying types and quantities of essential oils contained in the plants. The most important are 1,8 cineol, linalool, citral, methyl chavicol (estragole), eugenol and methyl cinnamate, although hardly any basil contains all of these in any significant amount.|$|E

5|$|Both {{boats were}} {{commissioned}} into the Austro-Hungarian Navy in 1909, with U-4 commissioned in August and U-3 in September. During the evaluations {{conducted by the}} Navy, the U-3 design bested the U-1 (Lake) and U-5 (Holland) classes in reliability and provided the best living conditions. They did, however, have the worst diving abilities of the three designs, and produced excessive exhaust smoke. To remedy the diving problems of the U-3-class, the fins were changed in size <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> several times. Eventually the front diving planes were removed and a stationary stern flap was affixed to the hull.|$|E

5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} {{protected}} by a hard-ridged outer layer of shell, called the chorion. This is lined with a thin coating of wax which prevents the egg from drying out before the larva has had time to fully develop. Each egg contains a number of tiny funnel-shaped openings at one end, called micropyles; {{the purpose of these}} holes is to allow sperm to enter and fertilize the egg. Butterfly eggs vary greatly in size <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> between species, but are usually upright and finely sculptured. Some species lay eggs singly, others in batches. Many females produce between one hundred and two hundred eggs.|$|E

5|$|Confusion {{with the}} highly {{regarded}} miller or sweetbread mushroom (Clitopilus prunulus) {{is a common}} cause of poisoning in France; the latter fungus has a greyish-white downy cap and whitish decurrent gills which turn pink with maturity. Young fruit bodies of Entoloma sinuatum can also be confused with St George's mushroom (Calocybe gambosa), although the gills of the latter are crowded and cream in colour, and the clouded agaric (Clitocybe nebularis), which has whitish decurrent gills and an unusual odour. To complicate matters, it often grows near these edible species. Its overall size <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> resemble members of the genus Tricholoma, although the spore colour (white in Tricholoma, pinkish in Entoloma) <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> (angular in Entoloma) help distinguish it. The rare and edible all-white dovelike tricholoma (T.columbetta) has a satiny cap and stem and a faint, not mealy, odour. E.sinuatum may be confused with Clitocybe multiceps in the Pacific Northwest of North America, although the latter has white spores and generally grows in clumps. A casual observer may mistake it for an edible field mushroom (Agaricus campestris), but this species has a ring on the stipe, pink gills that become chocolate-brown in maturity, and a dark brown spore print. The poorly known North American species E. albidum resembles E.sinuatum but is likewise poisonous.|$|E
5|$|Cyptotrama asprata (alternatively spelled aspratum), {{commonly}} known as the golden-scruffy collybia, is a saprobic species of mushroom in the family Physalacriaceae. Widely distributed in tropical regions of the world, it is characterized by the bright orange to yellow cap that in young specimens is covered with tufts of fibrils resembling small spikes. This fungus has had a varied taxonomical history, having been placed in fourteen genera before finally settling in Cyptotrama. This species is differentiated from several other similar members of genus Cyptotrama by variations in cap color, and spore size <b>and</b> <b>shape.</b>|$|E
5|$|DX arrays {{have been}} made to form hollow {{nanotubes}} 4–20nm in diameter, essentially two-dimensional lattices which curve back upon themselves. These DNA nanotubes are somewhat similar in size <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> to carbon nanotubes, and while they lack the electrical conductance of carbon nanotubes, DNA nanotubes are more easily modified and connected to other structures. One of many schemes for constructing DNA nanotubes uses a lattice of curved DX tiles that curls around itself and closes into a tube. In an alternative method that allows the circumference to be specified in a simple, modular fashion using single-stranded tiles, the rigidity of the tube is an emergent property.|$|E
