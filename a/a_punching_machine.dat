Grafcet is used for representing the control logic, and traditional programming languages are used for describing the pure algorithms. Grafcet is used for dividing the process to be automated in elementary sequences that can be easily implemented. Each sequence represent a step that has associated actions programmed using textual or graphical languages after case. The programming task is simplified by using a set of subroutines that are used in several steps. The paper presents an example of implementation for <b>a</b> <b>punching</b> <b>machine</b> for sheets and plates. The use the graphical languages the programming of a complex sequential process is a necessary solution. The state of Grafcet can be used for debugging and malfunction determination. The use of the method combined with a set of knowledge acquisition for process application reduces the downtime of the machine and improve the productivity. Keywords—Grafcet, Petrinet, PLC, punching.

There was <b>a</b> <b>punching</b> <b>machine</b> there in the plant which was punching a hole on a rear end cap of Mahindra Scorpio’s rear bumper. There were 4 metal clips which were fitted on that component before the part gets punched on punching machine. After some of the lots get punched, we observed that component is getting punched unless those clip fittings. At that time, company needs more time to fit metal clips on the component again which was time consuming. So this problem can be avoided by implementing Poka Yoke system to it. So, {{the aim of the}} project was avoid the mistake of missing of metal clip on it and make a system which will not allow to punch the hole unless and until all 4 metal clips are arranged on it...|$|E

40|$|Background: Standardisation is {{required}} in research, so are approval procedures for advanced therapy medical products and other procedures for articular cartilage therapies. The process of creating samples needs to be reproducible. The {{aim of this study}} was to design, create and validate instruments (1) to create reproducible and accurate defects and (2) to isolate samples in the shape of osteochondral cylinders in a quick, reliable and sterile manner. Methods: Adjustable instruments were created: a crown mill with a resolution of 0. 05  mm and a front mill to create defects in articular cartilage and subchondral bone. The instruments were tested on knee joints of pigs from the slaughterhouse; 48 defects were created and evaluated. <b>A</b> <b>punching</b> <b>machine</b> was designed to harvest osteochondral plugs. These were validated in an in vivo animal study. Results: The instruments respect the desired depth of 0. 5 and 1. 5  mm when creating the defects, depending on whether the person using the instrument is highly experienced (0. 451  mm; confidence interval (CI) : 0. 390  mm; 0. 512 mm and 1. 403  mm; CI: 1. 305  mm; 1. 502  mm) or less so (0. 369  mm; CI: 0. 297  mm; 0. 440 mm and 1. 241  mm; CI: 1. 141  mm; 1. 341  mm). Eighty samples were taken from knee joints of Göttingen Minipigs with this punching technique. The time needed for the harvesting of the samples was 7. 52  min (± 2. 18  min), the parallelism of the sides of the cylinders deviated by − 0. 63 ° (CI: − 1. 33 °; 0. 08 °) and the surface of the cartilage deviated from the perpendicularity by 4. 86 ° (CI: 4. 154 °; 5. 573 °). In all assessed cases, a sterile procedure was observed. Conclusions: Instruments and procedures for standardised creation and validation of defects in articular cartilage and subchondral bone were designed. Harvesting of samples in the shape of osteochondral cylinders can now be performed in a quick, reliable and sterile manner. The presented instruments and procedures can serve as helpful steps towards standardised operating procedures in the field of regenerative therapies of articular cartilage in research and for regulatory requirements...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDiscrete Event System (DES) {{has been}} used for Failure Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) {{of a wide range of}} systems. For real time systems, timed DES based {{frameworks}} diagnose failures leading to violation of delays or deadlines. These schemes declare a failure to be diagnosable if it always i. e., in all timed-traces, results in timing violations within finite time of its occurrence. The basic assumption is, probability of any trace can be 1 or 0. So, even if there is a trace where failure is manifested, still its probability can be 0, leading to non-diagnosability. However in many systems this basic assumption may not hold. To address this issue, Thorsley et al. have augmented probability values to transitions and termed the framework as stochastic DES. Here, failure is diagnosable if there are traces where failure effect is manifested and probability of occurrence of those traces increase with time and cross a threshold. However, the scheme was for un-timed systems. In the present paper we propose a DES based FDD framework for stochastic timed systems.

40|$|Abstract——- The {{greatest}} challenge faced by an engineer is {{to overcome the}} energy wasted due to friction in any mechanical process. In <b>a</b> conventional <b>punching</b> process, mechanical or hydraulic force is used to operate the punch which involves large amounts of metal to metal contact in the drive system components, as well as inaccuracy in {{the control of the}} punching forces at the micro level. This paper introduces the basic construction of <b>an</b> Electromagnetic assisted <b>punching</b> <b>machine</b> to carry out the punching operation. The punching force is generated by an electromagnetic coil wound around a metal core. Since the proposed design replaces Mechanical or hydraulic drive with an electromagnetic actuator, the setup is capable of perfectly controlling the force generated by the controlling the power supplied. The micro punching setup is designed to punch small parts at a precisely controlled rate of power consumption and thus the process becomes a low friction, high efficiency process. After successful fabrication, the setup was tested and the punching force produced was validated. The punched samples were further analyzed optically for any defects such as burring and those results were documented...|$|R
