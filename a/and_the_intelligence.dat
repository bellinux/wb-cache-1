5|$|Chnodomar {{could not}} ignore Julian's {{fortification}} of Saverne, as it threatened his control of Alsace and blocked his main access route {{into the interior}} of Gaul. He {{had come to see}} this region as Alamanni territory by right of conquest after occupying it for several years. He also claimed to possess letters from Constantius granting the Alamanni the right to occupy those lands. Chnodomar had been surprised and dismayed by Julian's successful campaigns of 355-7. But he was encouraged by his own success against Barbatio <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>intelligence</b> brought to him by a deserter that Barbatio's withdrawal had left the Caesar with only 13,000 men. Having driven two Roman magistri from the field (Barbatio and before him, Magnentius' lieutenant, Decentius), Chnodomar had lost the barbarians' traditional fear of pitched battles with the Romans.|$|E

The Australian Army and RAAF also provided most of the Allied radio interception capability in the SWPA, {{and the number of}} Australian radio interception units was greatly expanded between 1942 and 1945.

25|$|After the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots, at a Madhya Pradesh {{election}} {{rally in}} Indore, Rahul Gandhi claimed that {{a police officer}} has told him that Pakistan's ISI was trying to recruit disgruntled riot-affected youngsters.

In reply to the ECI's show-cause notice to explain why action should not be initiated against him for violating the Model Code of Conduct, Gandhi said that he didn't intend to exploit communal sentiments but was referring to divisive politics.|$|E
