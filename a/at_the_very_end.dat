5|$|The {{swell of}} the muzzle {{refers to the}} slight swell in the {{diameter}} of the piece <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end</b> of the chase. It is often chamfered on the inside to make loading the cannon easier. In some guns, this element is replaced with a wide ring and is called a muzzle band.|$|E
5|$|This {{fortress}} {{is placed}} at Ponta Oštro, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end</b> of Prevlaka peninsula. It {{was built in}} the mid-19th century, between 1856 and 1862, as part of the fortification system of the Bay of Kotor {{at the time of the}} Austrian Empire. By its monumentality and unique structure, it presents an exceptional example of military architecture of its time. Today, the fortress is out of use and badly damaged by various destructions during history.|$|E

5|$|Thomas and Mary Ann (Rhodes) Brown {{had four}} {{children}} (Arthur, Godfrey, Alice, and Frank) before leaving England for the warmer climate of the Hawaiian Islands in 1844. Louis (died in infancy), Cecil, and Malcolm were born in Hawaii. In 1853 the entire family left for Boston to put Arthur, Godfrey, and Frank in school. The remaining members of the Brown family returned to Hawaii <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end</b> of 1855.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end</b> of the Preclassic Period, around 100–300 AD, {{cities in}} the {{highlands}} and along the Pacific Coast ceased to raise sculpted stelae bearing hieroglyphic texts. This cessation {{in the production of}} stelae was the most dramatic symptom of a general decline in the region at this time. This decline has been linked to the intrusion of peoples from the western highlands combined with the disastrous eruption of the Ilopango Volcano that severely affected the entire region.|$|E
5|$|Costa Gomes {{argued that}} African {{soldiers}} were cheaper and were {{better able to}} create a relationship with the local populace, a tactic similar to the 'hearts and minds' strategy being used by United States forces in Vietnam at the time. These Flechas units saw action in the territory <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end</b> stages of the conflict, following the dismissal of Kaúlza de Arriaga {{on the eve of the}} Portuguese coup in 1974 – the Carnation Revolution. The units were to continue to cause problems for the FRELIMO even after the Revolution and Portuguese withdrawal, when the country splintered into civil war.|$|E

The ovary is superior and usually {{has a single}} ovule; although in pistillate flowers, the stamens are small and infertile. The mature fruit of Rhus integrifolia is sticky, reddish, covered with hairs, and about seven to ten millimeters in diameter. The elliptical fruit presents tight clusters <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>ends</b> of twigs.|$|R

5|$|Four large mosaic {{panels are}} {{installed}} on either {{ends of the}} station hall and the two escalator tunnels. On the side {{that leads to the}} exit to the city, a panel was installed depicting the patron saint of Kiev, Michael the Archangel. Meanwhile, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end</b> of the station, Saint George is depicted, symbolizing Moscow, the Soviet Union's capital at the time. One of the mosaic panels {{at the end of the}} station near the escalators includes an inscription featuring a Ukrainian nationalist slogan, stating СЛАВА УКРАЇНІ, which is translated as Glory to Ukraine.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these stacked structures, telomeres also form large loop structures called telomere loops, or T-loops. Here, the single-stranded DNA curls around in a long circle stabilized by telomere-binding proteins. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end</b> of the T-loop, the single-stranded telomere DNA is held onto a region of double-stranded DNA by the telomere strand disrupting the double-helical DNA and base pairing {{to one of the}} two strands. This triple-stranded structure is called a displacement loop or D-loop.|$|E
5|$|Much of our {{evidence}} for 4th century army unit deployments {{is contained in}} a single document, the Notitia Dignitatum, compiled c. 395–420, a manual of all late Roman public offices, military and civil. The main deficiency with the Notitia is that it lacks any personnel figures so as to render estimates of army size impossible. Also, it was compiled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end</b> of the 4th century; it is thus difficult to reconstruct the position earlier. However, the Notitia remains the central source on the late Army's structure due to the dearth of other evidence. The Notitia also suffers from significant lacunae and numerous errors accumulated from centuries of copying.|$|E
25|$|Since 1 September 2007, smoking {{has been}} {{prohibited}} {{in all of}} Deutsche Bahn's trains. Smoking areas had gradually been reduced to both cars <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>ends</b> of <b>the</b> ICE1 trainsets (cars 1 and 14). Until 30 September 2006, smoking was allowed in the Bistro area of the restaurant car. The restaurant area had always been smoke-free.

5|$|Sweet Tooth {{is a love}} story, a spy novel, and a {{book about}} {{literature}} itself. Serena and her boyfriend Haley– she a well-read but uncritical lover of literature, he a highly accomplished writer and literary scholar– have different attitudes towards literature. Serena prefers a realist approach, where life in the book reflects real life. Haley {{on the other hand}} is of a more modernist school, and enjoys experimentation in his work. McEwan plays with these differences, firstly by placing himself in the novel and blurring the line between author and character, and secondly by writing {{what appears to be a}} straight first-person narrative, only to distort this perception <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{emotional}} {{distance of}} the characters and the intellectual and artificial-seeming, quasi-theatrical dialogue is deliberate, depicting their simultaneous connection and isolation. The chasm between Marie and Julien, due to his corporeality and her ghostly nature, is emphasised in the contrast between his physical activity and her status as an onlooker. Rivette says he wanted the lovers to appear ill-suited and for the viewer to question the relationship; they love each other passionately yet they are essentially strangers. Béart believes that Marie was more alive than Julien, and that he literally wakes up to her existence only <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end</b> of the film.|$|E
5|$|When Nora arrives home, Ray {{shows up}} {{demanding}} {{the name of}} the person responsible. She tells him that the man responsible is Owen Harris. Ray finds Harris, along with his family, and nearly kills him. However, he realizes that Harris was an accountant who accidentally sent the barrel to the salvage yard. Seeing that he was ultimately innocent, Ray spares him and goes off to die. Scully believes that this act represented the last of Ray’s humanity. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end</b> of the episode, a car is dropped into a compactor at a salvage yard and crushed. As the camera fades out, Ray's eye is seen, still alive as the car is crushed.|$|E

It is apparent that she wants {{nothing to do with}} him, especially after he ruined her relationship, and even sends the watch he got her for her birthday back to him. However Effy gets the watch fixed, engraved with the word [...] "forever", and sends it back to Michelle, finally softening Michelle enough to answer Tony's phone call. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>ending</b> of <b>the</b> episode, she answers the phone, with merely [...] "I love you too" [...] before hanging it up again.|$|R
5|$|Kurosawa {{now turned}} to a more {{conventional}} story with Rhapsody in August—the director's first film fully produced in Japan since Dodeskaden over twenty years before—which explored the scars of the nuclear bombing which destroyed Nagasaki <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end</b> of World War II. It was adapted from a Kiyoko Murata novel, but the film's references to the Nagasaki bombing came from the director {{rather than from the}} book. This was his only movie to include a role for an American movie star: Richard Gere, who plays a small role as the nephew of the elderly heroine. Shooting took place in early 1991, with the film opening on 25 May that year to a largely negative critical reaction, especially in the United States, where the director was accused of promulgating naïvely anti-American sentiments, though Kurosawa rejected these accusations.|$|E
5|$|The Iron Mountain Mine, {{the most}} {{productive}} copper mine in California {{in at least one}} point along its history, operated along the banks of two Spring Creek tributaries, upstream from the current dam site, from 1879 to the 1960s. The mine extracted iron ore, silver, gold, copper sulfide ore, and pyrite from a rock formation dating to approximately 780,000 years ago. The potential of a mine at the site was discovered in 1860, when two men, surveyor William Magee and settler Charles Camden, discovered an extensive iron ore deposit along one of the tributaries of Spring Creek. In 1879, silver was also discovered at the site, and the mine was begun. The ownership was transferred to Mountain Mines Ltd., a London company, in 1894. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end</b> of the 19th century, Iron Mountain Mine took blames for several fish kills in the Sacramento River. Nevertheless, mining activity continued, and by 1928, 600 tons of ore were being extracted from the site per day.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the old {{characters}} in the Pokémon franchise, Mew's development was not overseen by Ken Sugimori, but by Game Freak programmer Shigeki Morimoto. Morimoto programmed Mew into the game secretly, as a prank amongst the staff just prior to its release in Japan, intending {{it to be a}} Pokémon only Game Freak staff members would know about and be able to obtain. Mew was added <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>end</b> of the development of Pokémon Red and Blue after the removal of debug features, freeing up just enough space to add the character despite being told not to alter the game any further at this point. Though not intended by the developers to be obtainable, due to a glitch, players were able to encounter it.|$|E
