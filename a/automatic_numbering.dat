40|$|Abstract. Land parcel {{numbering}} is {{an important}} part of the Land Administration. As the land parcels are not of uniform size, different in shape and not presenting simple geometric arrangement, using artificial code means heavy workload, low efficiency and error-prone. This paper develops a new program of land parcel <b>automatic</b> <b>numbering,</b> using C # and ArcGIS Engine components, which gets a good result in the practical projects. C # is a high-level programming language developed by Microsoft, which is object-oriented and running on the NET Framework. The ArcGIS Engine is a complete set of embedded GIS component library and tool library developed by ESRI. At present, the combination of C # and ArcGIS Engine is the main tool and means to develop GIS, which is widely used in National Geographic Informatio...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the wireless acquisition of multi-channel seismic data using a specialized mobile system, Seismobile, designed for subsoil diagnostics for transportation routes. The paper presents examples of multi-channel seismic records obtained during system tests in a configuration with 96 channels (4 landstreamers of 24 -channel) and various seismic sources. Seismic waves were generated {{at the same}} point using different sources: a 5 -kg hammer, a Gisco’s source with a 90 -kg pile-driver, and two other the pile-drivers of 45 and 70 kg. Particular attention is paid to the synchronization of source timing, the measurement of geometry by autonomous GPS systems, and the repeatability of triggering measurements constrained by an accelerometer identifying the seismic waveform. The tests were designed to the registration, reliability, and range of the wireless transmission of survey signals. The effectiveness of the <b>automatic</b> <b>numbering</b> of measuring modules was tested as the system components were arranged and fixed to the streamers. After measurements were completed, the accuracy and speed of data downloading from the internal memory (SDHC 32 GB WiFi) was determined. Additionally, the functionality of automatic battery recharging, the maximum survey duration, and the reliability of battery discharge signalling were assessed...|$|E
