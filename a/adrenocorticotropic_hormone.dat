5|$|In {{secondary}} adrenal insufficiency, a dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis {{leads to}} decreased {{stimulation of the}} adrenal cortex. Apart from suppression of the axis by glucocorticoid therapy, {{the most common cause}} of secondary adrenal insufficiency are tumors that affect the production of <b>adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone</b> (ACTH) by the pituitary gland. This type of adrenal insufficiency usually does not affect the production of mineralocorticoids, which are under regulation of the renin-angiotensin system instead.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal gland}} secretes a basal level of {{cortisol}} {{but can also}} produce bursts of the hormone in response to <b>adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone</b> (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary. Cortisol is not evenly released during the day – its concentrations in the blood are highest {{in the early morning}} and lowest in the evening {{as a result of the}} circadian rhythm of ACTH secretion. Cortisone is an inactive product of the action of the enzyme 11β-HSD on cortisol. The reaction catalyzed by 11β-HSD is reversible, which means that it can turn administered cortisone into cortisol, the biologically active hormone.|$|E
5|$|Glucocorticoids {{are under}} the {{regulatory}} influence of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Glucocorticoid synthesis is stimulated by <b>adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone</b> (ACTH), a hormone released into the bloodstream by the anterior pituitary. In turn, production of ACTH is stimulated {{by the presence of}} corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which is released by neurons of the hypothalamus. ACTH acts on the adrenal cells first by increasing the levels of StAR within the cells, and then of all steroidogenic P450 enzymes. The HPA axis {{is an example of a}} negative feedback system, in which cortisol itself acts as a direct inhibitor of both CRH and ACTH synthesis. The HPA axis also interacts with the immune system through increased secretion of ACTH at the presence of certain molecules of the inflammatory response.|$|E
5|$|The full {{profile of}} amphetamine's {{short-term}} drug effects in humans is mostly derived through increased cellular communication or neurotransmission of dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, histamine, CART peptides, endogenous opioids,C]carfentanil binding in several {{regions of the}} human brain, including the basal ganglia, frontal cortex, and thalamus (Colasanti et al. 2012). Oral administration of d-amphetamine, 0.5mg/kg, 3h before carfentanil injection, reduced BPND values by 2–10%. The results were confirmed in another group of subjects (Mick et al. 2014). However, Guterstam and colleagues observed no change in carfentanil binding when d-amphetamine, 0.3mg/kg, was administered intravenously directly before injection of carfentanil (Guterstam et al. 2013). It has been hypothesized that this discrepancy {{may be related to}} delayed increases in extracellular opioid peptide concentrations following amphetamine-evoked monoamine release (Colasanti et al. 2012; Mick et al. 2014).}} <b>adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone,</b> corticosteroids, and glutamate, which it effects through interactions with , , , , , , and possibly other biological targets.|$|E
25|$|CRH Regulates {{secretion}} of <b>Adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone</b> (ACTH).|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been {{observed}} in patients that the <b>adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone</b> (ACTH) level remains in the normal range. The {{reason for this is}} still unclear.|$|E
25|$|Modulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity: Oxytocin, {{under certain}} circumstances, {{indirectly}} inhibits release of <b>adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone</b> and cortisol and, in those situations, {{may be considered}} an antagonist of vasopressin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone</b> (ACTH), a {{pituitary}} peptide, {{also has}} some stimulating effect on aldosterone, probably by stimulating the formation of deoxycorticosterone, a precursor of aldosterone. Aldosterone is increased by blood loss, pregnancy, and possibly by further circumstances such as physical exertion, endotoxin shock, and burns.|$|E
25|$|The melanocortin 1 {{receptor}} (MC1R), {{also known}} as melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptor (MSHR), melanin-activating peptide receptor, or melanotropin receptor, is a G protein–coupled receptor that binds to a class of pituitary peptide hormones known as the melanocortins, which include <b>adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone</b> (ACTH) and the different forms of melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH).|$|E
25|$|In acute {{states of}} severe stress, {{cortisol}} secretion by {{the adrenal gland}} increases up to sixfold, parallel to {{the severity of the}} condition. This is partly due to an increased secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and <b>adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone</b> (ACTH). Several cytokines have been also shown to interfere with the HPA axis at multiple levels.|$|E
25|$|Cushing’s {{syndrome}} {{arises from}} the repeated hypersecretion of glucocorticoids. It {{can be caused by}} either an adrenal tumor or by hypersecretion of <b>adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone</b> (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary gland. It is predominantly due to an excess of the glucocorticoid cortisol. Secretion is typically regulated by the hypothalamus which secretes corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) to the pituitary gland, stimulating the pituitary to secrete <b>adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone</b> (ACTH). ACTH then travels to the adrenal glands and induces the release of cortisol into the bloodstream. In Cushing’s syndrome, this process occurs in excess. Some symptoms of an individual with Cushing’s syndrome include low tissue protein levels, due to muscle and bone atrophy, and high blood glucose levels. Sodium levels also see an increase which results in fluid retention in tissues and elevated blood pressure. In addition to hypersecretion of cortisol, excess androgens are secreted. In females, increased secretion of androgens, such as testosterone, results in masculinization which may present as facial hair growth and a deepened voice.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the effects listed above, use of high-dose steroids {{for more than a}} week begins to produce suppression of the patient's adrenal glands because the exogenous glucocorticoids suppress hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone and pituitary <b>adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone.</b> With prolonged suppression, the adrenal glands atrophy (physically shrink), and can take months to recover full function after discontinuation of the exogenous glucocorticoid.|$|E
25|$|Congenital adrenal {{hyperplasia}} due to 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency is {{an uncommon}} form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) {{resulting from a}} mutation in the gene {{for one of the}} key enzymes in cortisol synthesis by the adrenal gland, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) type II (HSD3B2). As a result, higher levels of 17OH-pregnenolone appear in the blood with <b>adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone</b> (ACTH) challenge, which stimulates adrenal corticosteroid synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Normal {{cortisol}} level can {{be explained}} by the strong negative feedback mechanism of cortisol on hypothalamus-pituitary axis system. That is, in the beginning, 17,20-lyase deficiency will block synthesis of sex steroid hormones, forcing the pathways to produce more cortisol. However, the initial excess of cortisol is rapidly corrected by negative feedback mechanism—high cortisol decreases secretion of <b>adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone</b> (ACTH) from zona fasciculata of adrenal gland. Thus, there is no mineralocorticoid overproduction. Also, there is no adrenal hyperplasia.|$|E
25|$|Domestication {{syndrome}} is the suite of phenotypic traits arising during domestication that distinguish crops from their wild ancestors. The term is also applied to vertebrate animals, and includes increased docility and tameness, coat color changes, reductions in tooth size, changes in craniofacial morphology, alterations in ear and tail form (e.g., floppy ears), {{more frequent and}} nonseasonal estrus cycles, alterations in <b>adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone</b> levels, changed concentrations of several neurotransmitters, prolongations in juvenile behavior, and reductions in both total brain size and of particular brain regions.|$|E
25|$|Sleep {{studies using}} polysomnography have {{suggested}} {{that people who have}} sleep disruption have elevated nighttime levels of circulating cortisol and <b>adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone.</b> They also have an elevated metabolic rate, which does not occur in people who do not have insomnia but whose sleep is intentionally disrupted during a sleep study. Studies of brain metabolism using positron emission tomography (PET) scans indicate that people with insomnia have higher metabolic rates by night and by day. The question remains whether these changes are the causes or consequences of long-term insomnia.|$|E
25|$|DHEA is {{produced}} in the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex {{under the control of}} <b>adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone</b> (ACTH) and by the gonads under the control of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). It is also produced in the brain. DHEA is synthesized from cholesterol via the enzymes cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1; P450scc) and 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17A1), with pregnenolone and 17α-hydroxypregnenolone as intermediates. It is derived mostly from the adrenal cortex, with only about 10% being secreted from the gonads. Approximately 50 to 70% of circulating DHEA originates from desulfation of DHEA-S in peripheral tissues. DHEA-S itself originates almost exclusively from the adrenal cortex, with 95 to 100% being secreted from the adrenal cortex in women.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has {{approved}} several drugs for managing {{some of the}} major manifestations of TSC. The antiepileptic medication vigabatrinwas approved in 2009 for treatment of infantile spasms and was recommended as first-line therapy for infantile spasms in children with TSC by the 2012 International TSC Consensus Conference. <b>Adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone</b> was approved in 2010 to treat infantile spasms. Everolimus was approved for treatment of TSC-related tumors in the brain (subependymal giant cell astrocytoma) in 2010 and in the kidneys (renal angiomyolipoma) in 2012. Everolimus also showed evidence of effectiveness at treating epilepsy in some people with TSC. In 2017, the European Commission approved everolimus for treatment of refractory partial-onset seizures associated with TSC.|$|E
25|$|Epinephrine acts by binding to {{a variety}} of {{adrenergic}} receptors. Epinephrine is a nonselective agonist of all adrenergic receptors, including the major subtypes α1, α2, β1, β2, and β3. Epinephrine's binding to these receptors triggers a number of metabolic changes. Binding to α-adrenergic receptors inhibits insulin secretion by the pancreas, stimulates glycogenolysis in the liver and muscle, and stimulates glycolysis and inhibits insulin-mediated glycogenesis in muscle. β adrenergic receptor binding triggers glucagon secretion in the pancreas, increased <b>adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone</b> (ACTH) secretion by the pituitary gland, and increased lipolysis by adipose tissue. Together, these effects lead to increased blood glucose and fatty acids, providing substrates for energy production within cells throughout the body.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone</b> (ACTH) and the {{sympathetic}} nervous system stimulate the synthesis of adrenaline precursors by enhancing the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine β-hydroxylase, two key enzymes involved in catecholamine synthesis. ACTH also stimulates the adrenal cortex to release cortisol, which increases the expression of PNMT in chromaffin cells, enhancing adrenaline synthesis. This is most often done in response to stress. The {{sympathetic nervous system}}, acting via splanchnic nerves to the adrenal medulla, stimulates the release of adrenaline. Acetylcholine released by preganglionic sympathetic fibers of these nerves acts on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, causing cell depolarization and an influx of calcium through voltage-gated calcium channels. Calcium triggers the exocytosis of chromaffin granules and, thus, the release of adrenaline (and noradrenaline) into the bloodstream.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone {{has been}} shown to inhibit steroid 11β-hydroxylase, an enzyme that is {{essential}} for the production of the glucocorticoid hormone cortisol. Because of this, glucocorticoid levels might be expected to be lowered, and hence, spironolactone might have some antiglucocorticoidic effects. In clinical practice, however, this has not been found to be the case; spironolactone has actually been found to increase cortisol levels, both with acute and chronic administration. Research has shown that this is due to antagonism of the MR, which suppresses negative feedback on the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA axis positively regulates the secretion of <b>adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone</b> (ACTH), which in turn signals the adrenal glands, the major source of corticosteroid biosynthesis in the body, to increase production of both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. Therefore, by antagonizing the MR, spironolactone causes an increase in ACTH secretion and by extension an indirect rise in cortisol levels. As such, any antiglucocorticoid activity of spironolactone via direct suppression of glucocorticoid synthesis (at the level of the adrenals) appears to be more than fully offset by its concurrent indirect stimulatory effects on glucocorticoid production.|$|E
500|$|Acute {{amphetamine}} {{administration in}} humans increases endogenous opioid release in several brain {{structures in the}} reward system. Extracellular levels of glutamate, the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, {{have been shown to}} increase in the striatum following exposure to amphetamine. This increase in extracellular glutamate presumably occurs via the amphetamine-induced internalization of EAAT3, a glutamate reuptake transporter, in dopamine neurons. Amphetamine also induces the selective release of histamine from mast cells and efflux from histaminergic neurons through [...] Acute amphetamine administration can also increase <b>adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone</b> and corticosteroid levels in blood plasma by stimulating the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis.|$|E
500|$|<b>Adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone</b> (ACTH) {{deficiency}} {{leads to}} adrenal insufficiency, {{a lack of}} production of glucocorticoids such as cortisol by the adrenal gland. If the problem is chronic, symptoms consist of fatigue, weight loss, failure to thrive (in children), delayed puberty (in adolescents), hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels), anemia and hyponatremia (low sodium levels). If the onset is abrupt, collapse, shock and vomiting may occur. [...] ACTH deficiency is highly similar to primary Addison's disease, which is cortisol deficiency {{as the result of}} direct damage to the adrenal glands; the latter form, however, often leads to hyperpigmentation of the skin, which does not occur in ACTH deficiency.|$|E
500|$|The {{pituitary}} gland {{consists of two}} parts, the anterior (front) and posterior (back) pituitary. Both parts release hormones that control numerous other organs. In pituitary apoplexy, the main initial problem {{is a lack of}} secretion of <b>adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone</b> (ACTH, corticotropin), which stimulates the secretion of cortisol by the adrenal gland. This occurs in 70% of those with pituitary apoplexy. A sudden lack of cortisol in the body leads to a constellation of symptoms called [...] "adrenal crisis" [...] or [...] "Addisonian crisis" [...] (after a complication of Addison's disease, the main cause of adrenal dysfunction and low cortisol levels). The main problems are low blood pressure (particularly on standing), low blood sugars (which can lead to coma) and abdominal pain; the low blood pressure can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention.|$|E
2500|$|Adrenal {{cortical}} cells, {{or other}} cells within the stroma of {{the adrenal cortex}} {{that are able to}} differentiate, [...] may reversibly change into fat or blood-forming cells. [...] This might occur because of the actions of adrenal cortex hormones, or of hormones released by the pituitary gland that act on the adrenal glands, such as <b>adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone</b> (ACTH).|$|E
2500|$|Domestication {{syndrome}} {{is a term}} often {{used to describe the}} suite of phenotypic traits arising during domestication that distinguish crops from their wild ancestors. The term is also applied to animals and includes [...] increased docility and tameness, coat color changes, reductions in tooth size, changes in craniofacial morphology, alterations in ear and tail form (e.g., floppy ears), more frequent and nonseasonal estrus cycles, alterations in <b>adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone</b> levels, changed concentrations of several neurotransmitters, prolongations in juvenile behavior, and reductions in both total brain size and of particular brain regions.|$|E
2500|$|The body's {{primary stress}} {{management}} {{system is the}} HPA axis. The HPA axis responds to physical and mental challenge to maintain homeostasis in part by controlling the body's cortisol level. Dysregulation of the HPA axis is implicated in numerous stress-related diseases, with evidence from meta-analyses indicating that different types/duration of stressors and unique personal variables can shape the HPA response. [...] HPA axis activity and cytokines are intrinsically intertwined: inflammatory cytokines stimulate <b>adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone</b> (ACTH) and cortisol secretion, while, in turn, glucocorticoids suppress the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines.|$|E
2500|$|Situated {{between the}} glomerulosa and reticularis, the zona fasciculata is {{responsible}} for producing glucocorticoids, such as 11-deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, and cortisol in humans. [...] Cortisol is the main glucocorticoid under normal conditions and its actions include mobilization of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, but it does not increase under starvation conditions. [...] Additionally, cortisol enhances the activity of other hormones including glucagon and catecholamines. [...] The zona fasciculata secretes a basal level of cortisol but can also produce bursts of the hormone in response to <b>adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone</b> (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary.|$|E
2500|$|Cortisol is {{produced}} {{in the human body}} by the adrenal gland in the zona fasciculata, the second of three layers comprising the adrenal cortex. The cortex forms the outer [...] "bark" [...] of each adrenal gland, situated atop the kidneys. The release of cortisol is controlled by the hypothalamus, a part of the brain. [...] The secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone by the hypothalamus triggers cells in the neighboring anterior pituitary to secrete another hormone, the <b>adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone</b> (ACTH), into the vascular system, through which blood carries it to the adrenal cortex. ACTH stimulates the synthesis of cortisol, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and dehydroepiandrosterone.|$|E
2500|$|The {{hypothalamus}} is {{the part}} of the brain that regulates function and responds to stress. [...] When the brain perceives environmental danger, the amygdala fires a nerve impulse to the hypothalamus to initiate the body's fight-or-flight mode through the sympathetic nervous system. [...] The stress response starts with the hypothalamus stimulating the pituitary gland, which releases the <b>adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone.</b> [...] This signals the release of cortisol, the stress hormone, initiating a multitude of physical effects on the body to aid in survival. [...] The negative feedback loop is then needed to return the body to its resting state by signaling the parasympathetic nervous system.|$|E
2500|$|The {{deficiency}} {{results in}} impaired synthesis {{of all three}} categories of adrenal steroids (cortisol, mineralocorticoids, sex steroids) {{and high levels of}} <b>adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone</b> (ACTH). A low level of steroid synthesis proceeds even without efficient transport, but is rarely enough to prevent the consequences of deficiency. [...] While severe loss of steroid production results in manifestation of the disease within a few weeks of birth, milder forms (late onset) can present years after birth. Unlike in models of the disease in mice, patients with lipoid CAH do not always have enlarged adrenals due to lipid accumulation. [...] This may in part be due to hormone replacement used to keep them alive preventing hyperstimulation of the gland by the pituitary.|$|E
2500|$|Since Harlow's {{pioneering}} work on touch research in development, recent work in rats has {{found evidence that}} touch during infancy resulted in a decrease in corticosteroid, a steroid hormone involved in stress, {{and an increase in}} glucocorticoid receptors in many regions of the brain. Schanberg and Field found that even short-term interruption of mother–pup interaction in rats markedly affected several biochemical processes in the developing pup: a reduction in ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity, a sensitive index of cell growth and differentiation; a reduction in growth hormone release (in all body organs, including the heart and liver, and throughout the brain, including the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brain stem); an increase in corticosterone secretion; and suppressed tissue ODC responsivity to administered growth hormone. Additionally, it was found that animals who are touch-deprived have weakened immune systems. Investigators have measured a direct, positive relationship between the amount of contact and grooming an infant monkey receives during its first six months of life, and its ability to produce antibody titer (IgG and IgM) in response to an antibody challenge (tetanus) at a little over one year of age. Trying to identify a mechanism for the [...] "immunology of touch", some investigators point to modulations of arousal and associated CNS-hormonal activity. Touch deprivation may cause stress-induced activation of the pituitary–adrenal system, which, in turn, leads to increased plasma cortisol and <b>adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone.</b> Likewise, researchers suggest, regular and [...] "natural" [...] stimulation of the skin may moderate these pituitary–adrenal responses in a positive and healthful way.|$|E
2500|$|Other signs include {{increased}} urination (and accompanying increased thirst), persistent {{high blood}} pressure (due to cortisol's enhancement of epinephrine's vasoconstrictive effect) and insulin resistance (especially common with ACTH production outside the pituitary), leading to high blood sugar and insulin resistance {{which can lead to}} diabetes mellitus. [...] Insulin resistance is accompanied by skin changes such as acanthosis nigricans in the axilla and around the neck, as well as skin tags in the axilla. Untreated Cushing's syndrome can lead to heart disease and increased mortality. Cortisol can also exhibit mineralocorticoid activity in high concentrations, worsening the hypertension and leading to hypokalemia (common in ectopic ACTH secretion). Furthermore, excessive cortisol may lead to gastrointestinal disturbances, opportunistic infections, and impaired wound healing related to cortisol's suppression of the immune and inflammatory responses. Osteoporosis is also an issue in Cushing's syndrome since osteoblast activity is inhibited. Additionally, Cushing's syndrome may cause sore and aching joints, particularly in the hip, shoulders, and lower back. [...] Cushing’s syndrome includes all the causes of increased cortisol leading to the diseased state. [...] Cushing’s disease is a specific type of Cushing’s syndrome caused by a pituitary tumor leading to excessive production of ACTH (<b>adrenocorticotropic</b> <b>hormone).</b> Excessive ACTH stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce high levels of cortisol, producing the disease state. Cushing's disease due to excess ACTH may also result in hyperpigmentation. This is due to Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone production as a byproduct of ACTH synthesis from Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). Alternatively, it is proposed that the high levels of ACTH, β-lipotropin, and γ-lipotropin, which contain weak MSH function, can act on the melanocortin 1 receptor. A variant of Cushing's disease can be caused by ectopic, i.e. extrapituitary, ACTH production from, for example, a small-cell lung cancer. When Cushing's syndrome is caused by an increase of cortisol {{at the level of the}} adrenal glands (via an adenoma or hyperplasia), negative feedback ultimately reduces ACTH production in the pituitary. In these cases, ACTH levels remain low and no hyperpigmentation develops. [...] While all Cushing’s disease gives Cushing’s syndrome, not all Cushing’s syndrome is due to Cushing’s disease.|$|E
