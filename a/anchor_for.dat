5|$|ABC hired Ellerbee {{away from}} NBC to co-anchor the show. The network {{considered}} Sander Vanocur, Dick Schaap and James Wooten as possible partners before selecting Gandolf, {{at the time}} the sports <b>anchor</b> <b>for</b> ABC's World News Saturday and World News Sunday.|$|E
5|$|On 4 September, Siboney sailed from New York on {{her fifth}} {{crossing}} {{and arrived at}} Saint-Nazaire nine days later. On 15September, she embarked a number of wounded troops and left Saint-Nazaire the same day, but, due to heavy submarine activity, swung at <b>anchor</b> <b>for</b> several days before her convoy sailed. She arrived on 29September at New York. On her sixth eastward crossing, between 6 and 15October, an influenza epidemic broke out among the troops, killing a number of soldiers. Sailing from Brest on 16October, the transport returned to New York on 24October.|$|E
5|$|San Marcos {{was used}} for gunnery {{practice}} throughout World War II, although generally as an <b>anchor</b> <b>for</b> a canvas target screen. Sitting two to six {{feet below the surface}} and marked by an unlit buoy, she was responsible for the sinking of the cargo ship Lexington in 1940 following a collision. Tons of explosives were used to demolish her upperworks and drive her hull deep into the mud; by January 1959, they were successful and she remains there today.|$|E

5|$|After riding at <b>anchor</b> <b>for</b> two weeks, Endeavour was heaved out of {{the water}} on 9 November and laid on her side for repairs. Some damaged timbers were found to be infested with shipworms, which {{required}} careful removal to ensure they did not spread throughout the hull. Broken timbers were replaced and the hull recaulked, scraped of shellfish and marine flora, and repainted. Finally, the rigging and pumps were renewed and fresh stores brought aboard for the return journey to England. Repairs and replenishment were completed by Christmas Day 1770, and the next day Endeavour weighed anchor and set sail westward towards the Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Cherry {{originally}} created Susan as a {{girl next}} door archetype and intended for the character to provide an emotional <b>anchor</b> <b>for</b> the series. When developing the character, Cherry drew upon his personal experiences {{as well as those}} of single women in his life. The role was originally written for Mary-Louise Parker, who turned it down; as a result, Hatcher was cast in early 2004. Hatcher's portrayal of the character is both comedic and vulnerable. During the series' debut season, both the character and Hatcher's performance received positive critical reception; however, as the series progressed, the character was received less favorably by critics and fans. Hatcher has received both a Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance in the series.|$|E
5|$|Jennings {{returned}} to the U.S. {{at the end of}} 1974 to become Washington correspondent and news <b>anchor</b> <b>for</b> ABC's new morning program AM America, a predecessor to Good Morning America. ABC was hoping that the show, in which it had invested $8 million, would challenge NBC's highly popular Today. AM America debuted on January 6, 1975, with Jennings delivering regular newscasts from Washington. The show never gained ground against Today, and was canceled in just ten months. In November 1975, Jennings moved abroad, this time as ABC's chief foreign correspondent. He continued to cover the Middle East, and in 1978 he was the first Canadian or American reporter to interview the Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran, then in exile in Paris.|$|E

5|$|Kawachi {{rejoined the}} First Squadron after her refit {{commanded}} by Captain Yoshimoto Masaki and entered Tokuyama Bay {{on the evening}} of 11 July 1918. The following morning torpedo target practice was cancelled due to rough seas and the battleship remained at <b>anchor</b> <b>for</b> the rest of the day. That afternoon a loud explosion was heard at 15:51 {{in the vicinity of the}} starboard forward main-gun turret and large quantities of smoke erupted from the turret and between the first and second funnels. Two minutes later, she began to list to starboard and capsized at 15:55, only four minutes after the explosion. Over a thousand men were aboard Kawachi at the time of the explosion and over 600 were killed, with 433 survivors.|$|E
5|$|NY86 {{begins at}} NY30 in Paul Smiths, Franklin County. The route heads east {{through the town}} of Brighton, {{providing}} mountain views of Adirondack Park. After passing through the tiny communities of Easy Street and Gabriels and traversing {{the southern edge of}} Paul Smiths College, NY86 turns south to serve Harrietstown, where it meets NY186 at the hamlet of the same name. NY86 continues southward to Saranac Lake, the largest community on NY86 in Franklin County. Moving through Saranac Lake, the business and tourism <b>anchor</b> <b>for</b> the area, NY86 is well marked, but follows local roads to an intersection with NY3 in the village center. The routes briefly overlap before splitting at the northern edge of Lake Flower.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{launched}} 21 June 1915 at the Denny shipyard in Dumbarton, Scotland. The launch had been delayed nine months, after the British Government ordered that all construction workers be pulled from non-military vessels {{after the start}} of the First World War, and work had been resumed only to make her slipway available for warships. She remained at <b>anchor</b> <b>for</b> the next year and a half. The Royal Navy purchased her on 27 February 1917 for completion as a combined landplane and seaplane carrier. The price of £138,118 included the cost of conversion to her new role. The ship was nearly complete when requisitioned, although her propelling machinery was not yet installed. Consequently, only limited internal modifications, notably the addition of three large workshops, could be made.|$|E

5|$|While {{ascending}} the mountain, {{the player}} activates helpful power-up abilities by collecting and planting minerals in marked plots. While {{there are over}} 30 abilities in total, the player starts with the basic four: Flagseed creates an additional checkpoint (in lieu of regressing further down the mountain upon losing a heart), Heartseed creates additional hearts from minerals, and the Crystal ability generates minerals from multiple plots. Thornvine's single-use, protective thorny vine can hurt enemies if aligned correctly, though some enemies require more than one hit to die, and the player forfeits all thorns upon losing a heart. As the game progresses, the player collects additional abilities, such as Flailflower, which turns the seed into an <b>anchor</b> <b>for</b> a spiky flail, and Floodfruit, which fills surrounding holes with water for easy passage. Thus the player constantly weighs whether to use minerals offensively (to eliminate enemies), defensively (to bypass difficult sections), or at all.|$|E

5000|$|The tendons are not {{placed in}} {{direct contact with}} the concrete, but are {{encapsulated}} within a protective sleeve or duct which is either cast into the concrete structure or placed adjacent to it. At each end of a tendon is an anchorage assembly firmly fixed to the surrounding concrete. Once the concrete has been cast and set, the tendons are tensioned ("stressed") by pulling the tendon ends through the anchorages while pressing against the concrete. The large forces required to tension the tendons result in a significant permanent compression being applied to the concrete once the tendon is [...] "locked-off" [...] at the anchorage. The method of locking the tendon-ends to the anchorage is dependent upon the tendon composition, with the most common systems being [...] "button-head" [...] <b>anchoring</b> (<b>for</b> wire tendons), split-wedge <b>anchoring</b> (<b>for</b> strand tendons), and threaded <b>anchoring</b> (<b>for</b> bar tendons).|$|R
