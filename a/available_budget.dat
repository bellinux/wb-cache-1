5|$|Fundraising {{efforts were}} led by Achsah M. Ely, {{a member of the}} college's class of 1868 and a {{professor}} of math at the school from 1887–1904. Donations came {{from a variety of sources}} including students attending the college (the class of 1889 donated a total of $148), student groups (the Philaletheis Society, the college's student dramatic organization, contributed $41 dollars in the hopes it could use the building once completed), trustees, and alumnae and their families. By June 1887, the college had raised between $18,000–20,000 and so hired architect William Tubby to design the new hall. Tubby returned to the college with estimates from Poughkeepsie builders ranging in cost from $39,997–50,000, higher than the <b>available</b> <b>budget.</b> The Vassar Board of Trustees formed a subcommittee and attempted to find solutions, including modifying Tubby's designs. The subcommittee received estimates from builders outside of Poughkeepsie (in Kingston, Brooklyn, Troy, and Albany) but the lowest was still above budget at $32,000.|$|E

Additional plans for a station in the Beacon Hill Tunnel were put on hold in November 1998, with the Sound Transit Board deciding to build the station structure and entry shaft within the <b>available</b> <b>budget</b> to allow for minimal disruptions to light rail service while the station was being constructed after the line opened. The construction of surface-level stations at Royal Brougham Way, later Stadium station, and South Graham Street in the Rainier Valley were also deferred, as part of $200 million in cuts to bring the project within its original $1.8 billion budget (equivalent to $ and $, respectively, in [...] ) to build a truncated Central Link from Sea-Tac Airport to the University District.|$|E

40|$|Past {{expenses}} {{have been}} shown to influence future spending behavior by depleting <b>available</b> <b>budgets.</b> However, a prerequisite for this relationship is the accurate recall of past payments and the experiencing of the full aversive impact associated with them. This article shows that the use of different payment mechanisms influences both these factors and hence moderates the effects of past payments on future spending. Specifically, past payments strongly reduce purchase intention when the payment mechanism requires the consumer to write down the amount paid (rehearsal) and when the consumer's wealth is depleted immediately rather than with a delay (immediacy). Two experiments show support for the proposed theoretical framework...|$|R
30|$|The road weather {{information}} system (RWIS), which collects and monitors weather and pavement surface conditions, {{has been proven}} effective to support winter road maintenance by improving safety, mobility, and efficiency. Although the geographic information systems are being widely applied for facility siting, traditional practices of sitting RWIS stations still heavily rely on the experiences of maintenance and operation personnel, which is time-consuming and subjective. This study develops a linear model to determine the optimal RWIS locations subject to three selection criteria: weather, traffic condition, and distance to existing RWIS sites, while considering practical constraints to satisfy specific requirements of various agencies (e.g., different weights of weather/traffic factors, various <b>available</b> <b>budgets,</b> etc.).|$|R

50|$|Budget {{authority}} is legal authority to obligate the federal government. For many war-related activities {{there may be}} a long lag between the time when budget {{authority is}} granted and when payments (outlays) are made by the U.S. Treasury. In particular, spending on reconstruction activities in Iraq and Afghanistan has lagged behind <b>available</b> <b>budget</b> authority. In other cases, the military uses contracts that are payable upon completion, which can create long lags between appropriations and outlays.|$|E

The failure to perform needed repairs could lead to asset deterioration and ultimately asset impairment.

40|$|The {{abandonment}} of land, the high energy load generated and accumulated by vegetation covers, {{climate change and}} interface scenarios in Mediterranean forest ecosystems are demanding serious attention to forest fire conditions. This is particularly true when dealing with the budget requirements for undertaking protection programs related {{to the state of}} current and future forest landscapes. Based on economic analysis, suppression costs represent a significant proportion of the total <b>budget</b> <b>available</b> for forest fire protection programs. The need to make efficient use of <b>available</b> <b>budgets</b> requires directing funding towards areas with the lowest costs and maximum benefits. Accordingly, incorporating econometric tools enables establishing criteria to optimize budget allocation.
