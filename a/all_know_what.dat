500|$|The full {{procedure}} for handling payments of Social Security and Medicare taxes, {{as well as}} state and federal unemployment insurance premiums, for household and child-care help remained quite complex, however, and over the following two decades, self-help articles were published with titles such as [...] "How to Avoid Your Very Own Nannygate" [...] and [...] "Time to Come Clean" [...] and with admonitions like [...] "we <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> happened to Kimba Wood and Zoë Baird." ...|$|E

500|$|Iginla is {{well known}} for his kind-hearted nature. Former Flames General manager Craig Button {{described}} Iginla as being grounded: [...] "He doesn't carry himself with any attitude or arrogance. He's confident in his abilities. He's self-assured. He's genuine. He's a better person than he is a player, and we <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> kind of player he is." [...] In 2002, while in Salt Lake City for the Winter Olympic Games, Iginla struck up a conversation with four Calgarians sitting next to his table, and found out they were sleeping in their car outside of the hotel. He excused himself from the conversation, and booked them accommodations at his own expense at the hotel his family was staying in.|$|E
500|$|... "No Future" [...] {{was nearly}} {{cut from the}} record. It was {{inspired}} by punk rock history, as many songs—for example, the Sex Pistols' [...] "God Save the Queen"—contain a [...] "no future" [...] lyric. [...] "Home Is Such a Lonely Place" [...] is a ballad with [...] "clean arpeggiated finger-picking guitars with strings underneath it." [...] Its lyrics are themed around lost love; it emerged from an early-morning coffee meeting between Hoppus and Feldmann, who both imagined how lonely their homes would be when their children grow up and move away. [...] "Kings of the Weekend" [...] was also nearly moved off the final track listing, but kept because of its recognizable guitar riff. Feldmann described it as [...] "the party song. We've all had day jobs and we <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> it's like to have that day off {{to do what we}} want." [...] "Teenage Satellites" [...] is based around [...] "being a kid and not knowing who you are, not having enough courage to say what you mean." [...] It was the last song recorded for the album, and it was at first written without a hook or melody in mind. [...] "Left Alone" [...] made the album cut because the band liked Skiba's vocal performance. [...] "Rabbit Hole" [...] was one of Hoppus' favorites, and revolves around [...] "standing your ground and not falling for people's nonsense." ...|$|E
500|$|Early in Bure's career, he {{was noted}} for playing a strong two-way game. Having joined Pat Quinn's defensive-minded Canucks in 1991, Bure's {{transition}} to the NHL was cited as being easier than that of his countryman, Igor Larionov, due to his quick adjustment to the team's defensive demands. Regarding Bure's first NHL game against the Winnipeg Jets, reporter Mike Beamish explained that [...] "hockey fans marvelled at his offensive thrusts, but hockey people were taken by a singular display of jet-powered defensive diligence. On one play, after the Canucks were caught deep in the Winnipeg zone, the Russian winger raced back and almost single-handedly foiled a two-on-one Jets' rush, making up a half-rink disadvantage." [...] Bure was used on the team's penalty kill for his entire tenure with the Canucks, and was proficient at generating shorthanded chances, pressuring the opposition with his quickness and positioning in the defensive zone. During the 1992 Stanley Cup playoffs, commentator and ex-NHL coach Harry Neale commented, [...] "I like the effort he gives it when he doesn't have the puck. We <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> he can do when {{he thinks he can}} score, but he's killing penalties, he's checking, doing a lot of things." [...] Bure tied for second-place on Bob McKenzie's 1993 coaches poll for the NHL's best penalty killer. He was also voted the league's second-best stickhandler that season and garnered recognition as one of the smartest players in the NHL.|$|E

500|$|In May, Benfica {{had four}} matches to gain four points on Sporting. The first {{was at the}} Estádio da Madeira with Nacional. Knowing that Sporting had lost points to Académica, Benfica hoped to narrow the gsp between them to two points. After an uneventful first half, in the 56th minute Nenê scored the opening goal for Nacional. Eight minutes later, Rúben Micael {{extended}} the lead, with Reyes reducing it in the 67th minute. Benfica pressed unsuccessfully for the equaliser before Nacional scored again with Miguel Fidalgo. Sánchez Flores realised that winning the league title was now impossible. On 9 May, Benfica met Trofense at home. Valdomiro scored first for the visitors in the 31st minute before Benfica scored twice in two minutes, reaching half-time with a 2–1 lead. In the second half, Paulinho tied the score for Trofense. Sporting won that day, so Benfica trailed by seven points with two match days left and could not qualify for the Champions League. Sánchez Flores said, [...] "I know when to arrive and when to leave. I {{do not want to}} be a problem for the club." [...] Playing out the schedule, Benfica first visited the Municipal de Braga. They won 3–1, ending a five-year winless streak there. The victory was against Jorge Jesus, widely reported as Sánchez Flores' successor. A week later, Benfica ended their campaign with a 3–1 win against Belenenses. Sánchez Flores analysed the club's season: [...] "They asked me to improve the team and I did. But we <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> happened last year; we should set realistic goals. Second place was possible, but we failed in the final third. I won a title and fought for another." [...] A short time later, he and the club terminated his contract.|$|E

In an ABC documentary entitled The Rise and Rise of Australian Rugby Dwyer stated that, [...] "I must say that throughout the 1991 World Cup, and this semi-final match in particular, Campo was a standout performer. We <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> a great player he was over such a long period of time, but I’m sure that his first-half performance that day has never been beaten." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 26 May 2010, Jágr {{announced}} he was backing the Civic Democrats and its leader Petr Nečas.

[...] He also urged the party not to forget about sports when distributing money. [...] "We <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> would happen if the young did not practice any sport.

2500|$|... "Case of the Ex" [...] {{garnered}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews. Billboard magazine compared the song to Destiny's Child's [...] "Jumpin', Jumpin'", and added: [...] "With its quick-programmed drum track [...] Mýa's 'Case of the Ex' {{is on the}} right track. Production-wise, the song used some computer tricks to play with Mýa's vocals. [...] is set to be a hot track on radio and in the clubs all summer long." [...] Jacqueline Springer of NME gave the song a mixed review, writing: [...] "No-good boyfriend anthem number four thousand eighty time, y'all [...] The stuttering arrangement of the original is cool and suits Mýa's brooding mood, but after a while it simply sits in the wind — there's no real build into a bassline leaving the track to run along a continuous pop/r vibe [...] Anyway, we <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> to do when ex-girlfriends re-emerge don't we?

2500|$|Writing for CNN, Sonia Katyal and Eduardo Peñalver {{said that}} [...] "A {{straight}} line {{runs from the}} 1930s sit-down strikes in Flint, Michigan, to the 1960 lunch-counter sit-ins to the occupation of Alcatraz by Native American activists in 1969 to Occupy Wall Street. Occupations employ physical possession to communicate intense dissent, exhibited by a willingness {{to break the law}} and to suffer the -- occasionally violent -- consequences." [...] Another CNN report by Douglas Rushkoff, said that even though the protesters are not ready to articulate an exact array of problems or how to solve them,"Anyone who says he has no idea what these folks are protesting is not being truthful. Whether we agree with them or not, we <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> they are upset about, and we all know that there are investment bankers working on Wall Street getting richer while things for {{most of the rest of}} us are getting tougher. What upsets banking's defenders and politicians alike is the refusal of this movement to state its terms or set its goals in the traditional language of campaigns...They mean to show that there is an inappropriate and correctable disconnect between the abundance America produces and the scarcity its markets manufacture".|$|E

2500|$|In January 2010, Ahern {{has said}} he would have no {{difficulties}} giving evidence to the investigation into banking, nor having his testimony heard in public. Saying he would appear if asked, Ahern defended his record while in government, attributing the crisis in banking to international factors and the banks’ over-exposure to borrowing on international markets. [...] "By and large we <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> happened. The banks borrowed money on the open market in the short-term. And as soon as things went, they had to pay that money up but they hadn’t got it to pay," [...] he said. [...] "That's what happened. I don’t think it will take too long [...] to write up what the position is." [...] He continued saying, [...] "The greater issue was the protection and the regulation of the bank rather than consumers’ interests." [...] Mr Ahern also said that people were [...] "jumping over developers" [...] but also needed to remember they employed 200,000 people. He said that {{one of the first things}} that Brian Cowen had done when he became minister for finance was to abolish many of the property tax incentives. He also stood over many of the incentives that benefited property developers. [...] "When they were brought in, the place was in a disastrous way. Look at the quays in Dublin. There were reports around for 40 years that said the quays needed something done about them and nothing happened until we brought in the urban renewal status and gave the tax incentives." ...|$|E
