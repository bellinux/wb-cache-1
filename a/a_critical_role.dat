As decomposers, they play {{an essential role in}} nutrient cycling, especially as saprotrophs and symbionts, degrading organic matter to inorganic molecules, which can then re-enter anabolic metabolic pathways in plants or other organisms.|$|E

5|$|Histological {{examination}} {{reveals that}} pachycephalosaurid domes {{are composed of}} a unique form of fibrolamellar bone which contains fibroblasts that play <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>role</b> in wound healing, and are capable of rapidly depositing bone during remodeling. Peterson et al. (2013) concluded that taken together, the frequency of lesion distribution and the bone structure of frontoparietal domes, lends strong support to the hypothesis that pachycephalosaurids used their unique cranial structures for agonistic behavior. CT scan comparisons of the skulls of Stegoceras validum, Prenocephale prenes, and several head-striking artiodactyls have also supported pachycephalosaurids as being well-equipped for head-butting.|$|E

40|$|Spatial {{terms such}} as on and in are found in every language, and psychologists have {{suggested}} that the meanings of these terms may be constructed from a universal set of spatial primitives. We develop a computational version of this idea and explore whether the primitives typically proposed are sufficient to account for the meanings of spatial terms across language s. We compare a model where spatial terms correspond directly to primitives with models that represent spatial terms as discrete or weighted combinations of primitives. Our results suggest that combinations play <b>an</b> <b>critical</b> <b>role,</b> and we find limited evidence for weighted combination...|$|R

Importantly, alpha2 subunit plays <b>an</b> <b>critical</b> <b>role</b> in the assembly of 19S base and 20S. In a study using Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteasome core particle 20S and regulatory particle 19S (similar to human proteasome) base component to delineate the binding process between 19S and 20S, evidences showed that one 19S subunit, Rpt6, can insert its tail into the pocket formed by alpha2 and alpha3 subunit, facilitating the complex formation between 20S and 19S base component.|$|R
5|$|Interstellar {{molecules}} {{are formed}} by chemical reactions within very sparse interstellar or circumstellar {{clouds of dust}} and gas. Usually this occurs when a molecule becomes ionized, often {{as the result of}} an interaction with a cosmic ray. This positively charged molecule then draws in a nearby reactant by electrostatic attraction of the neutral molecule's electrons. Molecules can also be generated by reactions between neutral atoms and molecules, although this process is generally slower. The dust plays <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>role</b> of shielding the molecules from the ionizing effect of ultraviolet radiation emitted by stars.|$|E
5|$|Loss of cell {{viability}} in the jack jumper's venom was researched through cytometry, which measures {{the proportions of}} cells that glow {{in the presence of}} fluorescent dye and 7-Aminoactinomycin D. Examinations of the rapidly reproducing Epstein–Barr B-cells showed that the cells lost viability within minutes when exposed to pilosulin 1. Normal white blood cells were also found to alter easily when exposed to pilosulin 1. However, partial peptides of pilosulin 1 were less efficient at lowering {{cell viability}}; the residue 22 N-terminal plays <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>role</b> in the cytotoxic activity of pilosulin 1.|$|E
5|$|Most natural {{membranes}} are {{a complex}} mixture of different lipid molecules. If {{some of the}} components are liquid at a given temperature while others are in the gel phase, the two phases can coexist in spatially separated regions, rather like an iceberg floating in the ocean. This phase separation plays <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>role</b> in biochemical phenomena because membrane components such as proteins can partition into {{one or the other}} phase and thus be locally concentrated or activated. One particularly important component of many mixed phase systems is cholesterol, which modulates bilayer permeability, mechanical strength, and biochemical interactions.|$|E

In this paper, an initial registration algorithm of point clouds based on random sampling is proposed. In the proposed algorithm, the base points set is first extracted randomly in the target point cloud, next an optimal corresponding points set is got from the source point cloud, then a transform matrix is estimated based on the two sets with least square methods, finally the matrix is applied on the source point cloud. Experimental results show that this algorithm has ideal precision as well as good robustness...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHyperthermia {{such as that}} {{occurring}} during fever {{may improve}} cell survival during infection, although its mechanism of action is largely unknown.

This induction seemed to be regulated through multiple Ras signal pathways involving extracellular signal-regulated kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase, and Rac 1 /NADPH oxidase, {{all of which have}} well been documented to be responsible for growth factor-induced cyclin D 1 expression. In a physiological sense, mild heat shock may regulate cell proliferation through inducing cyclin D 1 along with growth factors...|$|R
