5|$|Because of {{the scandals}} <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> Tour, Desgrange {{wanted to stop}} the race. He however changed his mind, and the rules were changed to prevent cyclists from cheating: the 1905 Tour de France would be decided with a points system.

5|$|Igneous {{activity}} <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> stretching occurred from 12million to 4million years ago. Sedimentation {{is concentrated}} in valleys (basins) from material eroded from adjacent ranges. The amount of sediment deposited has roughly kept up with this subsidence, resulting in retention of {{more or less the}} same valley floor elevation over time.|$|E
5|$|It {{can also}} be {{produced}} by oxidising the ephedrine analogue 4-methylephedrine using potassium permanganate dissolved in sulfuric acid. Because 4-methylephedrine can be obtained in a specific enantiomeric form, mephedrone consisting of only one enantiomer can be produced. The danger <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> method is it may cause manganese poisoning if the product is not correctly purified.|$|E

5|$|After the {{monument}} was discovered and {{identified in the}} twentieth century, a folk motif came {{to be associated with}} it. According to this story, the circle's stones had landed in their location after having been hurled at Corfe Castle by the Devil. This is a variant of a story that has also been connected to the Agglestone Rock near Studland. According to stories <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> large sandstone block, it had been thrown by the Devil from The Needles on the Isle of Wight, with the intention of hitting either the castle, Sherborne Abbey, Bindon Abbey, or Salisbury Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|An {{incidental}} finding <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> {{condition is}} a heel spur, a small bony calcification on the calcaneus (heel bone), {{which can be}} found in up to 50% of those with plantar fasciitis. In such cases, it is the underlying plantar fasciitis that produces the heel pain, and not the spur itself. The condition is responsible for the creation of the spur though the clinical significance of heel spurs in plantar fasciitis remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Blake Heinemann {{created the}} first breed {{standard}} and, in 1894, he founded the Devon and Somerset Badger Club, the aims of which were to promote badger digging rather than fox hunting, and the breeding of terriers suitable for this purpose. Terriers were acquired from Nicholas Snow of Oare, and they were likely descended from Russell's original dogs, as Russell would probably have hunted at some point with Snow's hunting club {{and is likely to}} have provided at least some of their original terriers. By the turn of the 20th century, Russell's name had become <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> breed of dog.|$|E

5|$|Carpenter faced many {{problems}} <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>this,</b> including {{the possibility of}} the Indians being rescued by their followers or being lynched by angry settlers, during their transport to the civilian court. During transport, Satank hid himself under his red blanket in his wagon while he gnawed the base of his thumb to the bone. This allowed him to slip the manacle from his wrist while he sang his death chant. With a small hidden knife that was not found during two separate searches, he stabbed the driver (who survived), both falling out of the wagon, grabbed a soldier's unloaded carbine and was mortally wounded in his escape attempt.|$|E
5|$|Chronic {{health effects}} from {{volcanic}} ash fall are possible, as exposure to free crystalline silica {{is known to}} cause silicosis. Minerals <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> include quartz, cristobalite and tridymite, which may all be present in volcanic ash. These minerals are described as ‘free’ silica as the SiO2 is not attached to another element {{to create a new}} mineral. However, magmas containing less than 58% SiO2 are thought to be unlikely to contain crystalline silica.|$|E
5|$|Globally about 106 {{million cases}} of {{chlamydia}} and 106 million cases of gonorrhea occurred in 2008. The {{number of cases}} of PID however, is not clear. It is estimated to affect about 1.5 percent of young women yearly. In the United States PID is estimated to affect about one million people yearly. A type of intrauterine device (IUD) known as the Dalkon shield led to increased rates of PID in the 1970s. Current IUDs are not <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> problem after the first month.|$|E

5|$|In the 16th century, the {{fishermen}} {{started to work}} in maritime activities, as pilots or seafarers in {{the crew of the}} Portuguese ships, due to their high nautical knowledge. The fishermen of the region are known to fish in Newfoundland since, at least, 1506. During the reign of John III the Povoan shipmaking art was already renowned, and Povoan carpenters were sought after by Lisbon's Ribeira das Naus shipyard due to their high technical skills. The single floored houses dominated the town's landscape, but there are indications of multiple floored habitations with rich architecture.
