40|$|The {{draft for}} the new traffic {{regulations}} is examined {{from the point of}} view of traffic safety. It is important to know if the modifications contribute to making <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>behaviour</b> safer. The knowledge of and ideas on the correlation between legislation, <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>behaviour</b> and traffic safety are studied. The effectiveness of the new legislation as regards <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>behaviour</b> depends on (1) the way in which the new legislation will be incorporated in other measures like education, training and testing of <b>road</b> <b>users,</b> (2) the way in which the new legislation will be used by the road administrator, and (3) the way in which other measures, such as police surveillance and enforcement, will be attuned to the new legislation...|$|R
40|$|The <b>behaviour</b> of <b>road</b> <b>users</b> is an {{important}} factor in accident causation. Traffic psychology, defined as ''the study of the <b>behaviour</b> of <b>road</b> <b>users</b> and the psychological processes underlying that behaviour'', attempts to identify the determinants of <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>behaviour</b> with the aim of developing effective accident countermeasures. Models of <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>behaviour</b> involve driver task analyses, functional control models, and motivational models focused on risk taking and risk acceptance. The relation between accident occurrence and the preceding behaviour is largely unclear; performance aspects as well as motivational aspects, individual differences and momentary state variables all appear to be relevant. Attempts to modify <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>behaviour</b> involve driver training, enforcement, and rehabilitation. Given the impact of the transport system on the environment in terms of pollution and land use, mobility, and the possibilities of influencing transport mode choice and travel behaviour, will be a major challenge in the future...|$|R
40|$|Less {{motorised}} {{countries in}} Asia exhibit {{a variety of}} road safety problems. The <b>behaviour</b> of <b>road</b> <b>users</b> contributes significantly to these problems, together with road environment and vehicle factors. As well as addressing road environment issues, engineering measures provide a convenient way of modifying <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>behaviour,</b> and have been widely implemented in Asia for this purpose. However, implicit assumptions about <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>behaviour</b> which {{have their origin in}} motorised countries can lead to the implementation of engineering measures having impacts which run counter to expectation. This paper reviews some of these cases, and demonstrates that a fuller understanding of the factors determining <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>behaviour</b> in the countries concerned would probably have led to better outcomes. An approach for improving the road safety outcomes of engineering interventions is proposed, involving explicit identification of assumptions, research using qualitative and anthropological techniques, and development of local research expertise...|$|R

In addition, it aims at describing and quantifying <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>behaviour</b> in relation to emission levels and fuel consumption, focussing in particular on the effects of driving style, road and road network characteristics, and traffic conditions such as congestion, impaired visibility or adverse weather.

30|$|Traditionally, <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>behaviour</b> {{research}} has been using driving simulators, instrumented vehicles, self-reports, analyses of crash statistics, and increasingly also in-depth crash investigation. These methods have greatly contributed {{to the understanding of}} <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>behaviour.</b> However, they also have several limitations. For example, results from driving simulator studies cannot always be easily transferred to real traffic situations, since both the traffic environment and the vehicle characteristics are only approximations of reality. This is especially true in the simpler and static-based simulators. In instrumented vehicle studies subjects drive in real traffic but in a special, highly equipped vehicle with, usually, an experimenter on-board. This makes subjects {{aware of the fact that}} they participate in an experiment which may affect their driving behaviour. The results of self-reports may be biased by socially desirable responses as well as by perceptual and memory limitations.|$|R
40|$|The Safe System {{approach}} to road safety utilises a holistic {{view of the}} interactions among vehicles, <b>roads</b> and <b>road</b> <b>users.</b> Yet, the contribution {{of each of these}} factors to crashes is vastly different. The role of <b>road</b> <b>users</b> is widely acknowledged as an overwhelming contributor to road crashes. Substantial gains have been made with improvements to vehicle and roads over a number of years. However, improvements of the <b>road</b> <b>user’s</b> <b>behaviour</b> has been (in some cases) less substantial. A <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>behaviour</b> that is relatively unregulated is driver sleepiness, {{which is part of the}} ‘fatal five’ of risky <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>behaviours.</b> The effect of sleepiness is ubiquitous – sleepiness is a state that most, if not all drivers on our roads has experienced, and is habitually exposed to. The quality and quantity of daily sleep is integral to our level of neurobehavioural performance during wakefulness and as such can have a compounding effect on a number of other risky driving behaviours. This paper will discuss the potential influence of sleepiness as an interceding factor for a number of risky driving behaviours. Little effort has been given to increasing awareness of the deleterious and wide ranging effects that sleepiness has on road safety. Given the wide ranging influence of sleepiness, improvements of ‘sleep health’ as a protective factor at the community or individual level could lead to significant reductions in road trauma and increases of general well being. A discussion of potential actions to reduce sleepiness is required if reductions of road trauma are to continue...|$|R

40|$|Surrogate safety {{analysis}} {{is the process}} of diagnosing road safety indirectly from measures of ordinary (non-collision) <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>behaviour,</b> such as absolute speed and time-to-collision. While absolute speed has enjoyed much popularity in the literature, other measures such as time-to-collision are currently under developed. Before conflict measures such as time-to-collision can be adopted, several challenges need to be overcome, notably the problem of accurately modeling collision courses and collision probability from normal <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>behaviour.</b> This paper describes and explores the feasibility of implementing discretized motion pattern maps for the purpose of predicting potential collisions between <b>road</b> <b>users</b> and their measures based on an empirical naturalistic behaviour model calibrated from site-specific data for use in surrogate {{safety analysis}}.

40|$|The self-explaining roads (SER) {{approach}} uses road {{designs that}} evoke correct expectations and driving <b>behaviours</b> from <b>road</b> <b>users</b> {{to create a}} safe and user-friendly road network. Following the implementation of an SER process and retrofitting of local and collector roads in a suburb within Auckland City, lower speeds on local roads and less variation in speed on both local and collector roads were achieved, along with a closer match between actual and perceived safe speeds. Preliminary analyses of crash data shows that the project {{has resulted in a}} 30 % reduction crash numbers and an 86 % reduction in crash costs per annum, since the road changes were completed. In order to further understand the outcomes from this project, a study was carried out to measure the effects of the SER intervention on the activity and <b>behaviour</b> of all <b>road</b> <b>users.</b> Video was collected over nine separate days, at nine different locations, both before and after SER construction. <b>Road</b> <b>user</b> <b>behaviour</b> categories were developed for all potential <b>road</b> <b>users</b> at different location types and then used to code the video data. Following SER construction, on local roads there was a relatively higher proportion of pedestrians, less uniformity in vehicle lane keeping and less indicating by motorists along with less through traffic, reflecting a more informal/low speed local road environment. Pedestrians were less constrained on local roads following SER construction, possibly reflecting a perceptually safer and more user-friendly environment. These behaviours were not generally evident on collector roads, a trend also shown by the previous study of speed changes. Given that one of the objectives of SER is to match <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>behaviour</b> with functionally different road categories, the <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>behaviour</b> differences demonstrated on different road types within the SER trial area provides further reinforcement of a successful SER trial...|$|R

40|$|The need {{to improve}} road safety remains a global {{challenge}} particularly in developing regions. In fact, despite a relatively low vehicle population, underdeveloped and developing countries account for 90 % of road transport related fatalities and injuries globally. To date, solutions implemented have not been effective enough given the high incidences and crashes that still frequently occur and sometimes with devastating effects showing that effective solutions remain elusive. Various dimensions and approaches can be pursued and/or deployed towards addressing safety on the road network, particularly those focusing on road infrastructure, vehicular and human behaviour safety. However, what matters most is the impact that will be derived thereof towards addressing safety. This paper focuses {{on one of the}} dimensions: <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>behaviour</b> changing interventions towards improving road safety. The qualitative research method was applied towards the development of this paper. It was established that among many possible interventions that can be deployed to improve road safety in South Africa, <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>behaviour</b> changing interventions have a substantial impact on overall safety improvement. The major reason being that these interventions are proactive in nature, hence <b>road</b> <b>users</b> are capacitated {{to be able to take}} a proactive approach rather than being reactionary to possible incidences and crashes on the road. However, the effectiveness of <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>behaviour</b> focused interventions has its own challenges that will need to be addressed.

40|$|Shared space, or shared streets, is {{an urban}} design {{approach}} encouraging pedestrians and drivers {{to share a}} common surface by minimizing segregation features. Advocates contend that the concept generates extensive social, cultural and economic benefits. Scholarship investigating schemes and purported benefits have been limited primarily to European and New Zealand applications. Identifying the need to study shared space operations in the Canadian context, this research offers a quantitative evaluation of <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>behaviour</b> and shared street performance on Granville Island in Vancouver, Canada. Utilizing video survey, data was collected at three diverse sample sites between December 2015 and February 2016. Data was analyzed using univariate and bivariate statistical analysis and overall shared space performance was quantified using the Karndacharuk (2014) Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) index. The behavioural analysis revealed {{that the majority of}} pedestrian movements transpired outside the vehicle path and road space. Contiguous land uses were an important predictor of <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>behaviour,</b> as higher frequencies of pedestrians crossing the vehicle path were positively correlated with higher densities of commercial uses. Regression analysis calculated that vehicle path crossings were also a statistically significant predictor of vehicle speeds and interaction occurrences with vehicles. During interaction occurrences with vehicles, pedestrians were deemed to have priority. Regarding shared space performance, Granville Island managed both pedestrian and driver mobility effectively. Calculated performance in the Place function was substandard, as shared space design failed to inspire pedestrian reclamation of the street space. A key finding, the AHP index was recalibrated, enabling a custom, quantitative evaluation of pedestrian reclamation of road space on Granville Island. Results corroborated the importance of local traffic conditions noted in shared space literature. Future research should be undertaken to study the qualitative aspects of shared space on Granville Island, as well as an appraisal of street performance and <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>behaviour</b> under disparate conditions...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to develop a self-report {{questionnaire}} to provide a classification of aberrant <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>behaviour</b> in adolescent children. An Adolescent <b>Road</b> <b>user</b> <b>Behaviour</b> Questionnaire (ARBQ) was developed, comprising 43 items requiring respondents to rate the frequency with which they engaged in specific examples of road-using behaviour. The questionnaire was completed by 2433 children aged 11 - 16. Factor analysis showed that responses to the 43 items were best fitted by a three-factor solution. Factor 1 comprised items relating to "unsafe road crossing behaviour", factor 2 comprised items related to "dangerous playing in the road", and factor 3 comprised items which as a group were termed "planned protective behaviour". A revised 21 -item ARBQ was produced by selecting the items that loaded most strongly on the three factors. The 21 -item instrument had good internal reliability.

40|$|Determining what {{consequences}} {{are likely to}} serve as effective punishment for any given behaviour is a complex task. This chapter focuses specifically on illegal <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>behaviours</b> and the mechanisms used to punish and deter them. Traffic law enforcement has traditionally used the threat and/or receipt of legal sanctions and penalties to deter illegal and risky behaviours. This process represents the use of positive punishment, {{one of the key}} behaviour modification mechanisms. Behaviour modification principles describe four types of reinforcers: positive and negative punishments and positive and negative reinforcements. The terms ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ are not used in an evaluative sense here. Rather, they represent the presence (positive) or absence (negative) of stimuli to promote behaviour change. Punishments aim to inhibit behaviour and reinforcements aim to encourage it. This chapter describes a variety of punishments and reinforcements that have been and could be used to modify illegal <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>behaviours.</b> In doing so, it draws on several theoretical perspectives that have defined behavioural reinforcement and punishment in different ways. Historically, the main theoretical approach used to deter risky road use has been classical deterrence theory which has focussed on the perceived certainty, severity and swiftness of penalties. Stafford and Warr (1993) extended the traditional deterrence principles to include the positive reinforcement concept of punishment avoidance. Evidence of the association between punishment avoidance experiences and behaviour has been established for a number of risky <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>behaviours</b> including drink driving, unlicensed driving, and speeding. We chose a novel way of assessing punishment avoidance by specifying two sub-constructs (detection evasion and punishment evasion). Another theorist, Akers, described the idea of competing reinforcers, termed differential reinforcement, within social learning theory (1977). Differential reinforcement describes a balance of reinforcements and punishments as influential on behaviour. This chapter describes comprehensive way of conceptualising a broad range of reinforcement and punishment concepts, consistent with Akers’ differential reinforcement concept, within a behaviour modification framework that incorporates deterrence principles. The efficacy of three theoretical perspectives to explain self-reported speeding among a sample of 833 Australian car drivers was examined. Results demonstrated that a broad range of variables predicted speeding including personal experiences of evading detection and punishment for speeding, intrinsic sensations, practical benefits expected from speeding, and an absence of punishing effects from being caught. Not surprisingly, being younger was also significantly related to more frequent speeding, although in a regression analysis, gender did not retain a significant influence once all punishment and reinforcement variables were entered. The implications for speed management, as well as <b>road</b> <b>user</b> <b>behaviour</b> modification more generally, are discussed in light of these findings. Overall, the findings reported in this chapter suggest that a more comprehensive approach is required to manage the <b>behaviour</b> of <b>road</b> <b>users</b> which does not rely solely on traditional legal penalties and sanctions...|$|R

The three factors were ???unsafe crossing behaviour???, ???playing on the road??? and ???planned protective behaviour???. This research also found that males and those who were at least part Maori were more likely to put themselves at risk by playing on the road. Furthermore, those who identified themselves as being part Maori also engaged in unsafe road crossing behaviour more often than Caucasian and Asian adolescents. Interestingly, only the interaction effect between age and sex was significantly related to engagement in planned protective behaviour.

Methods: In order to group the questionnaire variables together, an exploratory factorial analysis (principal component analysis (PCA)) was used. Subsequently, the reliability coefficients of the questionnaire and the subscales were calculated. Lastly, ANOVA models were used to compare differences in the whole sample and a cluster analysis was performed to identify different risky pre-driver groups. Results: The factorial analysis (PCA) reveals the existence of five risk factors (speed and risk, external circumstances, distraction, alcohol and driving and other elements of driving) that explain 44. 6 % of the variance. More males than females reported that they had a higher tendency to take risks in all the risky factors exposed and injured pre-drivers reported less awareness of road safety than pre-drivers who had not been injured.
