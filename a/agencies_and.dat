40|$|Effective gender {{research}} {{requires a}} revision {{of the meaning of}} the current notions of <b>agency</b> (masculinity) <b>and</b> communion (femininity), as well as a close examination of the impact of these constructs on well-being outcomes. Based on V. S. Helgeson's (1994) model of sex, <b>agency,</b> communion, <b>and</b> well-being, two studies were conducted to (1) examine the concepts of <b>agency</b> <b>and</b> communion in a multidimensional manner; (2) assess and review the association between <b>agency</b> <b>and</b> mental health through the inclusion of peer reports and a relevant meta-analysis; (3) explore the association between <b>agency</b> <b>and</b> social adjustment, including two pertinent meta-analyses; and (4) empirically assess conceptual parallels among the constructs of <b>agency</b> <b>and</b> communion with the following personality-related constructs: Masculine and feminine traits, agentic and communal behaviors, power and intimacy motivation, and self-critical and dependent depressive styles, as well as their association with well-being outcomes. Findings reveal a positive association between <b>agency</b> <b>and</b> social adjustment, suggest a possible tendency to inflate levels of psychological adjustment in agentic individuals, and highlight the need to revise the concepts of <b>agency</b> <b>and</b> communion as encompassing multiple as opposed to uniform dimensions. Each dimension can lead to diverse well-being outcomes. Lastly, these studies call into question the need to postulate unmitigated forms of <b>agency</b> <b>and</b> communion. Taken as a whole, this work provides evidence for the complexity of the relations between gender and well-being...|$|R

However, it was found that MNRF’s also have more total debt. This is surprising given the higher <b>agency</b> <b>and</b> bankruptcy costs.

30|$|However, {{we think}} {{there are still some}} {{problems}} that need to be dealt with. As two main aspects of minimal self, sense of <b>agency</b> <b>and</b> sense of ownership are connected with each other in a complex way. Two common models are existing in terms of the relations of senses of <b>agency</b> <b>and</b> ownership. In an “additive” model, <b>agency</b> <b>and</b> ownership are strongly related, while an“independent” model holds <b>agency</b> <b>and</b> ownership differ in experiences quanlitatively (Tsakiris, Longo, & Haggard, 2010). Even though they have been approved to be driven by different kinds of information and related to different psychological functions (Tsakiris, 2017), it is necessary to consider both of these two experiences when studying how bodily states can affect emotional feelings. The available evidence can be taken to suggest that ownership <b>and</b> <b>agency</b> are strongly related to affective reactivity (Ma, Lippelt, & Hommel, 2017); however, it is more common to use emotional variables as stimuli to investigate their impact on <b>agency</b> <b>and</b> ownership but not vice versa. In the present study, we tried to investigate how different situations of sense of <b>agency</b> <b>and</b> sense of ownership could interact different emotional events in terms of stress feelings.|$|R

30|$|We {{used the}} virtual hand {{illusion}} paradigm {{to study how}} sense of <b>agency</b> <b>and</b> sense of (body) ownership can interact with different emotional events on stress feelings. Converging evidence {{for at least the}} partial independence of <b>agency</b> <b>and</b> ownership was found. For instance, sense of agency was a better predictor of individual anxiety levels than sense of ownership and males showed stronger effects related to agency—presumably due to gender-specific attribution styles and empathy skills. Moreover, <b>agency</b> <b>and</b> ownership also interacted with emotional events and led to different anxiety levels. Taken together, our findings suggest that the disentangled sense of <b>agency</b> <b>and</b> sense of ownership can interact with different emotional events and influenced stress feelings more in threatening situations than awarding ones.|$|R

The book unravels the complex relationships between the nature of youth <b>agency</b> <b>and</b> participation, in education, but also in wider political, economic and social arenas, and the potential of young people to expand their freedoms to lead lives they have reason to value.

40|$|Memories {{of how one}} was parented {{and their}} linkage to current {{parenting}} practices were examined for one hundred parents of adolescents. Parents (65 women, 35 men) recalled their most important memories from childhood involving their mother and their father, and as well completed a survey of current parenting practices using {{a modified version of}} the Children's Reports of Parental Behavior Inventory. After recalling each memory parents were asked to indicate the degree of <b>agency</b> <b>and</b> communion and levels of positive and negative affect experienced. Cluster analyses of memories of one's mother and father each revealed four major types of memories. These were memories characterized by very high <b>agency</b> <b>and</b> communion and very high positive affect; those with moderately high <b>agency</b> <b>and</b> communion and moderate positive affect; those with relatively low <b>agency</b> <b>and</b> moderate communion with low levels of positive and negative affect; and finally a group with extremely low <b>agency</b> <b>and</b> communion and high negative affect. Analyses revealed that those with moderately high <b>agency</b> <b>and</b> communion and those with extremely low <b>agency</b> <b>and</b> communion were the parents who were least likely to use psychological control methods of discipline such as instilling guilt and persistent anxiety. Nor were they intrusively controlling. By contrast, those who reported extremely positive memories with high <b>agency</b> <b>and</b> communion were the most likely to use psychological control methods of discipline and to be the most intrusive and over-involved. Further analyses of the level of object relations revealed in the memories showed that for many in this latter group representations of people were rather simple, whereas representations in the other two groups were more complex. These patterns suggest that memories with an extremely high positive gloss may be defensively held and relatively unexamined, and that those holding such memories have not reflected on their parenting practices since they are the most likely to use discipline methods likely to inflict psychological pain. On the other hand, parents who recalled such negative interactions from their childhood had transformed the way in which they interacted with their adolescents so that they matched those who recalled positive experiences from childhood and who seemed to fully appreciate what they had been given by these experiences...|$|R
