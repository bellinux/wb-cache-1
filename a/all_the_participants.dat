5|$|Harrison's musical biographer, Simon Leng, {{identifies}} friendship as the {{key factor}} behind {{the success of the}} two UNICEF shows, both in bringing <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> together on the stage and in the affection with which the audience and music critics viewed the event. Klaus Voormann, a close friend of Harrison's since 1960, has often cited this quality as well.|$|E

Punk defeated Knox in their first singles match (qualifying for the Extreme Elimination Chamber at December to Dismember in the process) {{as well as the}} rematch, after which Kelly Kelly celebrated Punk's victory over her boyfriend.

TripleH interrupted and announced that the WWE Board of Directors had removed McMahon from power in a vote of no confidence, and that TripleH was to take over the day-to-day operations of WWE.

5|$|After {{his time}} on the Kentucky Court of Appeals, Hines {{returned}} to practicing law in Frankfort, Kentucky. In 1886, Hines began writing a series of four articles discussing the Northwest Conspiracy for Basil W. Duke's Southern Bivouac magazine. The magazine was dedicated {{to the memory of}} the Lost Cause of the Confederacy, but was less adversarial than similar Southern magazines, gaining a larger Northern readership than similar journals. The first of the articles was printed in the December 1886 issue. However, after consulting with former Confederate president Jefferson Davis at Davis' home in Mississippi, Hines did not name anybody on the Northern side who assisted in the conspiracy. After writing the first article, Hines was attacked for not being more forthcoming regarding <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> from both newspapers' reviewers (particularly from the Louisville Times) and Southern readers, which discouraged Hines from publishing any more accounts of the Northwest Conspiracy.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} this period that Marquis became {{interested}} in the Battle of the Little Bighorn and the death of Custer. This interest became an obsession that was to last the rest of his life. The battle site was only twenty-five miles to the west on the Crow Indian Reservation. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> of the battle on the US side had died in action, but very little had been published in the way of Indian accounts. Most information had come from soldiers who only witnessed the aftermath. Marquis realized that {{there were a number of}} Cheyenne participants of the battle still alive on the reservation. However, interviewing them at length seemed too difficult at this time. There was the language barrier, and Marquis was busy as a doctor trying to cover a large area.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} at a {{stalemate}} {{for the next five}} or six hours, with <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> immobilized. Bonnet's men had the advantage that their deck was heeled away from their opponents, giving them cover, while the Henrys deck was tilted toward the pirates, thus exposing Rhett's men to punishing musket volleys. Bonnet's force suffered twelve casualties while killing ten and wounding fourteen of Rhett's 70-man crew. Most of Bonnet's men fought enthusiastically, challenging their enemies to board and fight hand to hand, and tying a knot in their flag as a mock signal to come aboard and render aid. Bonnet himself patrolled the deck with a pistol drawn, threatening to kill any pirate who faltered in the fight. Nevertheless, some of the prisoners who had been forced to join the pirate crew refused to fire on Rhett's men, and one narrowly escaped death at Bonnet's hands in the confusion of the engagement.|$|E
