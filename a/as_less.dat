The same organisation's polling did find that Miliband's personal ratings in his first full year of leadership were better than David Cameron's during his first full year as Conservative leader in 2006.|$|E

On 22 August 1947, just after a week of becoming governor general, Jinnah dissolved the elected government of Dr. Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan. Later on, Abdul Qayyum Khan was put in place by Jinnah in the Pashtun-dominated province despite his being a Kashmiri. On 12 August 1948 the Babrra massacre in Charsadda occurred there, resulting in the death of 400 people aligned with the Khudai Khidmatgar movement.|$|E
5|$|But as American {{involvement}} in Vietnam was winding down, the Army canceled the Cheyenne program on 9 August 1972. By this time, the AH-1 Cobra was widely deployed by the Army during the Vietnam War and {{equipped with the}} TOW anti-tank missile. Controversy with the United States Air Force over the Cheyenne's role in combat {{as well as the}} political climate regarding military acquisition programs had caused the Army to amend the service's attack helicopter requirements in favor of a twin-engine conventional helicopter, viewed <b>as</b> <b>less</b> technical and more survivable.

5|$|Eddie Izzard as {{the voice}} of Reepicheep, a swashbuckling mouse. Over 100 actors auditioned to voice the character. Izzard {{approached}} Reepicheep <b>as</b> <b>less</b> camp and more of a bloodthirsty assassin with a sense of honour (a cross between Mad Max and a Stormtrooper from Star Wars): Izzard interpreted Reepicheep as someone whose family was killed by the Telmarines. The Narnia series were some of the few books Izzard read as a child, and he cherished them. When discussing Reepicheep to the animators, Adamson told them to rent as many Errol Flynn films as possible. Adamson credits Izzard for making the role his own; beforehand, the director was approaching the character similarly to Puss in Boots in Shrek 2.|$|E
5|$|Frazee {{sold the}} rights to Babe Ruth for $100,000, the largest sum ever paid for a {{baseball}} player. The deal also involved a $350,000 loan from Ruppert to Frazee, secured by a mortgage on Fenway Park. Once it was agreed, Frazee informed Barrow, who, stunned, told the owner {{that he was getting}} the worse end of the bargain. Cynics have suggested that Barrow may have played a larger role in the Ruth sale, <b>as</b> <b>less</b> than a year after, he became the Yankee general manager, and in the following years made a number of purchases of Red Sox players from Frazee. The $100,000 price included $25,000 in cash, and notes for the same amount due November 1 in 1920, 1921, and 1922; Ruppert and Huston assisted Frazee in selling the notes to banks for immediate cash.|$|E
5|$|In August 1792 {{she started}} Catharine or the Bower, which presaged her mature work, {{especially}} Northanger Abbey; {{it was left}} unfinished and the story picked up in Lady Susan, which Todd describes <b>as</b> <b>less</b> prefiguring than Catharine. A year later, she began but abandoned a short play, later titled Sir Charles Grandison or the happy Man, a comedy in 6 acts, which she returned to and completed around 1800. This was a short parody of various school textbook abridgements of Austen's favourite contemporary novel, The History of Sir Charles Grandison (1753), by Samuel Richardson.|$|E

5000|$|The term {{idiopathic}} postprandial syndrome, which literally means a syndrome {{that occurs}} after eating (postprandial) and of unknown cause (idiopathic), was coined {{in an attempt}} to reserve the term hypoglycemia for those conditions in which low glucose levels could be demonstrated.

5|$|In Christian theology, {{the work}} of the Holy Spirit under the Old Covenant is viewed <b>as</b> <b>less</b> {{extensive}} than that under the New Covenant inaugurated on the day of Pentecost. The Spirit was restricted to certain chosen individuals, such as high priests and prophets. Often termed the “spirit of prophecy” in rabbinic writings, the Holy Spirit was closely associated with prophecy and divine inspiration. It was anticipated that in the future messianic age God would pour out his spirit upon all of Israel, which would become a nation of prophets.|$|E
5|$|In The New York Times, {{journalist}} Michael Massing {{felt that}} the author's view on contemporary free-speech issues (her stance on limiting censorship, and her view that little television programming could cause harm to children) was extreme. The American Prospect criticized the author's presentation style, acknowledging Heins was a skilled attorney {{on the subject of}} civil liberties, but called the book itself boring. The review compared the author's writing style to comic books, and concluded Heins' chronology of litigation regarding profane speech came across <b>as</b> <b>less</b> than a neutral presentation.|$|E
5|$|In a {{departure}} from his usually serious compositions in 1957 to 1963, Lutosławski also composed light music under the pseudonym Derwid. Mostly waltzes, tangos, foxtrots and slow-foxtrots for voice and piano, these pieces are in the genre of Polish actors' songs. Their place in Lutosławski's output may be seen <b>as</b> <b>less</b> incongruous given his own performances of cabaret music during the war, and {{in the light of}} his relationship by marriage to the famous Polish cabaret singer Kalina Jędrusik (who was his wife's sister-in-law).|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the Doctor, Jack {{is more of a}} conventional action hero, as well as outwardly flirtatious and capable of acts which the Doctor would view <b>as</b> <b>less</b> than noble. In the programme's narrative, Jack begins as a time traveller and former con man from the 51st century, who comes to travel with the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) and his companion Rose (Billie Piper). As a consequence of his death and resurrection in the 2005 Doctor Who finale, Jack becomes immortal and is stranded on 19th century Earth. There he becomes a member of Torchwood, a British organization dedicated to combating alien threats. He spends over a century waiting to reunite with the Doctor, over which time he becomes Torchwood's leader. Eventually, he reunites with the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) for several appearances in Doctor Who. Aspects of the character's backstoryboth prior to meeting the Doctor, and during his many decades living on Earthare gradually revealed over Torchwood (and to a lesser extent, Doctor Who) through the use of flashback scenes and expository dialogue.|$|E
5|$|In road {{snow and}} ice control, brine is often used as an anti-icer rather than a de-icer. A vehicle carries a tank of brine, which is sprayed on the road surface before or {{at the onset of}} the storm. This keeps {{snow and ice}} from {{adhering}} to the surface and makes mechanical removal by plows easier. Solid salt is also wetted with brine or other liquid deicer. This speeds de-icing action and helps keep it from bouncing off the pavement into the gutter or ditch. Brine acts faster than solid salt and does not require compression by passing traffic to become effective. The brine is also more environmentally friendly, <b>as</b> <b>less</b> salt is required to treat the same length of road.|$|E
5|$|Jackson won the Democratic primary with 48% of {{the vote}} to Jones's 39%, with the rest {{of the vote}}s {{scattered}} among the other three candidates. The Republicans nominated Thomas Somer. Since the district was overwhelmingly Democratic, Jackson was the favorite for the December 12, 1995 special election. Jackson won the general election with 76% of the vote; his victory was widely anticipated. Upon his victory, Jackson made it known he would be a liberal voice in opposition to Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich. He took office on December 15, 1995. Jackson was perceived <b>as</b> <b>less</b> charismatic than his father and less credentialed than his predecessor, but his family pedigree was expected to help him politically. In August 1996, Somer withdrew from a rematch leaving Jackson with no major party opposition in the November 1996 general election. As a result, Jackson received 94% of the vote in the general election.|$|E
