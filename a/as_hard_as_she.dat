500|$|During an {{interview}} with entertainment website Digital Spy Dennis discussed Paul's later relationships in depth. Paul's relationship with Lyn Scully (Janet Andrewartha) was short lived, he mistreated her but ultimately in a twist for the character, he did the right thing. Dennis describes this as: [...] "The Lyn story was quite sincere, {{but he had the}} good sense {{on the day of the}} wedding to tell her that he was no good. So he obviously cared about Lyn, but then she came back and haunted him." [...] His relationship with Rebecca Napier (Jane Hall) at times can be fiery, of this Dennis said: [...] "I want to see Paul and Rebecca be like Angie and Dirty Den. I think Rebecca is capable of that. She plays a fiery character and is a very strong. Paul needs somebody who is absolutely there for him and adores him, but will take no shit from him and stand up and fight <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> does." ...|$|E
2500|$|Push and Shove has {{received}} generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 61, based on 23 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic compared it favorably to Stefani's solo albums, stating, [...] "hat's {{the interesting thing}} about Push and Shove, for as much as there are clever contemporary flourishes [...] this is a modest, mature comeback, highlighted by the band's keen awareness of their strengths and subtle, unstated acknowledgment of encroaching middle age." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Melissa Maerz commented that on Push and Shove, Stefani [...] "pogos <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> did in her Anaheim-strip-mall ska days. But she's also just as neurotic, which adds depth to her love songs." [...] In a review for the Los Angeles Times, Mikael Wood opined, [...] "At its best, Push and Shove channels some of the infectiously restless energy of Rock Steady [...] And it further polishes a bold mix-and-match aesthetic that feels familiar today in part because of records such as Tragic Kingdom." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Guardian said [...] "despite {{the usual}} collaborators, it is Ciara's {{presence}} that is stamped {{firmly on the}} album. Evidence that she is an under-rated balladeer {{comes in the form}} of [...] "Keep Dancin' on Me", a shimmering slow jam, and the morning-after existential haze of [...] "I Don't Remember", but a terpsichorean swagger remains at the heart of Ciara's world. Few artists go <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> does on her club jams, whether inviting the world to 'kiss my swag' over kinetic freestyle beats on [...] "Pucker Up", combining outraged soprano braggadocio with thunderous crunk baselines on the broiling [...] "High Price" [...] or gliding smoothly through the delectable, sun-kissed [...] "Echo". At her best, her pace is furious, and keeping up is exhilarating." [...] Digital Spy gave it three out of five stars and commented that [...] "Fantasy Ride features much the same cast of producers as countless other R albums from the last couple of years, but these A-list knob-twiddlers rarely try anything risky or inventive here. However, this isn't to say that Fantasy Ride is a bad album. It actually offers a consistently sexy listen with enough minor triumphs – [...] "Love Sex Magic", [...] "Turntables" [...] and the electro-scuzzy [...] "Pucker Up" [...] – to hold your attention. Ciara, meanwhile, is on a seductive form throughout. Ciara's Fantasy Ride deserves the benefit of the doubt." [...] However, Billboard gave it an average review, stating, [...] "On 'High Price,' where she takes her vocals to an opera-like pitch, and her collaboration with the-Dream, 'Lover's Things,' whose faint tenor would seem like an ideal match, Ciara seems to go almost unnoticed. Thankfully, 'Work,' featuring Missy Elliott, has Ciara showing fly-girl antics over a house-like, clap-laden production, and the breakup song 'Never Ever,' featuring Young Jeezy, which samples 'If You Don't Know Me by Now,' pick up the slack." [...] In his Consumer Guide, however, Robert Christgau gave the album a [...] "dud" [...] score (...) [...]|$|E

Catwoman is taken into custody by Tom, but not before Laurel reveals the side-effects of the product: Discontinuing its use makes the skin disintegrate, while continuing its use makes the skin <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> marble. <b>She</b> also plans to release the Beau-line the following day.|$|R
60|$|Ajor seemed {{determined}} that I should speak Caspakian {{as quickly as}} possible, and I thought I saw in her desire {{a little of that}} all-feminine trait which has come down through all the ages from the first lady of the world--curiosity.

She was a regular little animated question-mark. She bubbled over with interrogations which were never to be satisfied unless I learned to speak her tongue. Her eyes sparkled with excitement; her hand flew in expressive gestures; her little tongue raced with time; yet all to no avail. I could say man and tree and cliff and lion {{and a number of other}} words in perfect Caspakian; but such a vocabulary was only tantalizing; it did not lend itself well to a very general conversation, and the result was that Ajor would wax so wroth that she would clench her little fists and beat me on the breast <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>she</b> could, and then she would sink back laughing as the humor of the situation captured her.|$|R
