5|$|Banksia sessilis is also <b>a</b> <b>source</b> of {{food for}} the Australian ringneck (Barnardius zonarius), and the long-billed black {{cockatoo}} (Calyptorhynchus baudinii), which tear open the follicles and consume the seeds.|$|E

50|$|Lava {{extruded}} {{from the}} volcano is primarily trachydacite to trachyandesite in composition, transitioning from more andesitic to more dacitic compositions over time. The magma is likely a mix {{from three different}} <b>sources,</b> <b>a</b> rhyodacite <b>source,</b> <b>a</b> dacite <b>source</b> (likely itself <b>a</b> mixture of rhyodacite and basalt), and <b>a</b> mafic <b>source.</b>|$|R
5|$|Besides parasitizing {{the host}} ant, P. rebeli also parasitizes the {{grassland}} plant Gentiana cruciata as <b>a</b> <b>source</b> of nutrition and feeds off of its flowers and developing fruits.|$|E

5|$|But geology also {{provided}} an alternate route, albeit across foreign territory. The valleys of the Red and Minnesota Rivers {{lay in the}} beds of Glacial Lake Agassiz and its prehistoric outlet Glacial River Warren; the lands exposed when these bodies of water receded were flat plains between low uplands covered by prairie grasslands. At the Traverse Gap, only a mile (1.6 km) of land separated the Bois des Sioux River, <b>a</b> <b>source</b> stream of the Red (which flowed north to Hudson Bay) and the Little Minnesota River, <b>a</b> <b>source</b> stream of the Minnesota River (tributary to the Mississippi, which flowed south to the Gulf of Mexico). The valley floors and uplands of the watercourses along this gently graded route provided a natural thoroughfare to the south. The eyes of the colonists therefore turned to the new United States, both as <b>a</b> <b>source</b> of supplies and an (illegal) outlet for their furs.|$|E
50|$|In {{the theory}} of {{electrical}} networks, <b>a</b> dependent <b>source</b> is <b>a</b> voltage <b>source</b> or <b>a</b> current <b>source</b> whose value depends on a voltage or current somewhere else in the network.|$|R

5|$|European beech (Fagus sylvatica), {{although}} edible, {{have never}} been popular as <b>a</b> <b>source</b> of food. They {{have been used as}} animal feed and to extract a popular edible oil.|$|E
5|$|Fruitbodies of L.holopus are <b>a</b> <b>source</b> of {{food for}} fly species such as Pegomya winthemi (family Anthomyiidae) and Megaelia pygmaeoides (family Phoridae).|$|E
5000|$|<b>A</b> {{dependent}} <b>source</b> is <b>a</b> current <b>source</b> or {{voltage source}} {{that depends on}} the voltage or current of another element in the circuit. When <b>a</b> dependent <b>source</b> is contained within an essential mesh, the dependent source should be treated like <b>an</b> independent <b>source.</b> After the mesh equation is formed, <b>a</b> dependent <b>source</b> equation is needed. This equation is generally called a constraint equation. This is an equation that relates the dependent source’s variable to the voltage or current that the source depends on in the circuit. The following is a simple example of <b>a</b> dependent <b>source.</b>|$|R

5|$|Lithotrophic {{bacteria}} can use inorganic compounds as <b>a</b> <b>source</b> of energy. Common inorganic electron donors are hydrogen, carbon monoxide, ammonia (leading to nitrification), ferrous iron and other reduced metal ions, and several reduced sulfur compounds. In unusual circumstances, the gas methane {{can be used}} by methanotrophic bacteria as both <b>a</b> <b>source</b> of electrons and a substrate for carbon anabolism. In both aerobic phototrophy and chemolithotrophy, oxygen is used as a terminal electron acceptor, whereas under anaerobic conditions inorganic compounds are used instead. Most lithotrophic organisms are autotrophic, whereas organotrophic organisms are heterotrophic.|$|E
