5|$|To {{alleviate}} {{shortages and}} supply the war effort, the U.S. Army and the Canadian government began {{construction of the}} Alaska Highway, which connected the Canadian road network to Alaska's Richardson Highway and Fairbanks. The highway was completed in fall 1942 and regular traffic began in 1943. As work on the highway took place, war supplies were already reaching Fairbanks through the <b>air.</b> The Northwest <b>Staging</b> <b>Route,</b> a chain of airfields, ended at Fairbanks. Starting in February 1942, supply aircraft began landing in Fairbanks to supply the war effort in Alaska. In summer 1942, negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union resulted in {{an extension of the}} Lend-Lease effort to Russia. Using the Northwest <b>Staging</b> <b>Route,</b> aircraft were flown from Great Falls, Montana, to Ladd Field. At Ladd Field, the aircraft were turned over to Soviet pilots, who flew them to Nome and on to the Soviet Union. Fairbanks was chosen as a transfer location because it was more protected from potential Japanese attack than Nome.|$|R

40|$|A new method, {{reversed}} <b>air</b> <b>staging,</b> for decreasing N 2 O from {{fluidised bed}} combustion, {{was investigated in}} a 12 MW circulating fluidised bed boiler. Previous measurements, showing that the N 2 O is decreased to one fourth (25 ppm), and NO to half(40 ppm) with maintained sulphur capture, were confirmed. Supplementary information on reversed <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> was obtained from additional measurements. By adjusting the temperature and the air ratio {{it was possible to}} reduce the CO emission. Thus, the N 2 O emission can be reduced to the level of 25 ppm, with the emissions of NO, SO 2 and CO maintained at about same level as with normal <b>air</b> <b>staging.</b> Low load in combination with reversed <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> resulted in:further reduced emissions. The effect of reversed <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> on the emissions from peat {{is similar to that of}} bituminous coal.

40|$|Reversed <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> is {{a method}} to reduce nitrous oxide (N 2 O) {{emissions}} from circulating fluidized bed boilers (FBBs). Tests in a 12 MW circulating FBB show that the N 20 emission can be lowered to one fourth without affecting the emissions of NO,SO 2 or CO and without adverse effects on the combustion efficiency. The focus of the paper is on the conditions in the combustion chamber. Measurements inside the combustion chamber reveal how the combustion conditions are affected by reversed <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> compared to normal <b>air</b> <b>staging.</b> These measurements confirm the working principle of reversed <b>air</b> <b>staging,</b> namely to provide more oxidizing conditions in {{the lower part of}} the combustion chamber and lower stoichiometry in the upper part of the combustion chamber...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBiomass (straw and wood) {{co-firing}} with coal {{was investigated}} in a drop tube furnace. Emission of NO and CO along {{the height of the}} furnace was monitored by a gas analyzer on line, and the content of unburned carbon (UBC) in fly ash was also tested. The effects of fuel type, temperature, co-firing and <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> ratio were considered. Results showed that along the height of the furnace, NO concentration increased first and then decreased slowly for all the fuels, and NO emission from straw or wood combustion only accounted for about 1 / 3 or 1 / 2 of that from coal combustion respectively. In the present temperature range of 900 - 1100 oC, the increasing in temperature increased NO emission but decreased UBC in some degree, while the effect on CO emission was little. Under the condition of biomass co-firing, NO emission, CO emission and UBC were significantly reduced more with the increasing in biomass co-firing ratio. Moreover, results of <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> combustion showed that for coal combustion <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> notably reduced NO emission while increased UBC and CO emission, but for biomass combustion the effect of <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> was less significant. Further test of <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> on biomass co-firing indicated that only under the co-firing ratio of 0. 4 could <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> play a great influence on NO emission and combustion efficiency. This present study could provide a guide for the optimization of biomass co-firing in industrial furnaces...|$|R

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>staging</b> is a {{well-known}} effective method to control NOx emissions from solid fuel combustion boilers. However, further research is still needed to clarify the effect of <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> at different injection locations on the gaseous emissions of Fluidised Bed Combustion (FBC) boilers that fire 100 % biomass fuels, particularly non-woody biomass fuels. The main objective of this work is to investigate {{the effect of the}} <b>staging</b> <b>air</b> injection location on the gaseous emissions (NOx and CO) and temperature profiles of a 20 kWth bubbling fluidised bed combustor firing three non-woody (straw, miscanthus and peanuts) and two woody biomass fuels. The experimental results showed that injecting the secondary air at the higher location could lead to a greater NOx reduction {{due to the fact that}} the biomass combustion reaction mainly took place in the splash zone and/or beginning of the freeboard. Up to 30 % of NOx reduction, compared with no <b>air</b> <b>staging,</b> was achieved for the non-woody fuels when the <b>staging</b> <b>air</b> was injected at the higher position. <b>Air</b> <b>staging</b> also significantly reduced the CO emissions as a result of the higher temperatures in the freeboard and longer residence time in the primary combustion zone...|$|R
