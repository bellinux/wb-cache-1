The aim {{of this study was to}} utilize solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) to resolve the delivery problem and to investigate the biodistribution of <b>amsacrine</b> analog-loaded SLN. Physicochemical characterizations of SLN, including particle size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency, and stability, were evaluated. In vitro release behavior was also measured by the dialysis method. In vivo pharmacokinetics and biodistribution behavior of <b>amsacrine</b> analog were investigated and incorporated with a non invasion in vivo imaging system to confirm the localization of SLN. The results showed that <b>amsacrine</b> analog-loaded SLN was 36. 7 nm in particle size, 0. 37 in polydispersity index, and 34. 5 ± 0. 047 mV in zeta potential. More than 99 % of <b>amsacrine</b> analog was successfully entrapped in the SLN. There were no significant differences in the physicochemical properties after storage at room temperature (25 °C) for 1 month. <b>Amsacrine</b> analog-loaded SLN maintained good stability. An in vitro release study showed that <b>amsacrine</b> analog-loaded SLN sustained a release pattern and followed the zero equation. An in vivo pharmacokinetics study showed that <b>amsacrine</b> analog was rapidly distributed from the central compartment to the tissue compartments after intravenous delivery of <b>amsacrine</b> analog-loaded SLN.

40|$|<b>Amsacrine</b> is an anilinoacridine {{derivative}} anticancer drug, used {{to treat}} {{a wide variety of}} malignancies. In cells, <b>amsacrine</b> poisons topoisomerase 2 by stabilizing DNA-drug-enzyme ternary complex. Presence of <b>amsacrine</b> increases the steady-state concentration of these ternary complexes which in turn hampers DNA replication and results in subsequent cell death. Due to reversible binding and rapid slip-out of <b>amsacrine</b> from DNA duplex, structural data is not available on amsacrine-DNA complexes. In the present work, we designed five oligonucleotide duplexes, differing in their minor groove widths and hydration pattern, and examined their binding with <b>amsacrine</b> using attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. Complexes of <b>amsacrine</b> with calf thymus DNA were also evaluated for a comparison. Our results demonstrate {{for the first time that}} <b>amsacrine</b> is not a simple intercalator; rather mixed type of DNA binding (intercalation and minor groove) takes place between <b>amsacrine</b> and DNA. Further, this binding is highly sensitive towards the geometries and hydration patterns of different minor grooves present in the DNA.

Although most anticancer drugs are believed not to cause acquired long QT syndrome (LQTS), concerns have been raised by reports of QT interval prolongation, ventricular fibrillation and death associated with <b>amsacrine</b> treatment. Since blockade of cardiac human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) potassium currents is an important cause of acquired LQTS, we investigated the acute effects of <b>amsacrine</b> on cloned HERG channels to determine the electrophysiological basis for its proarrhythmic potential. HERG channels were heterologously expressed in human HEK 293 cells and Xenopus laevis oocytes, and the respective potassium currents were recorded using patch-clamp and two-microelectrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology. <b>Amsacrine</b> blocked HERG currents in HEK 293 cells and Xenopus oocytes in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC 50 values of 209. 4 nM and 2. 0 μM, respectively. HERG channels were primarily blocked in the open and inactivated states, and no additional voltage dependence was observed. <b>Amsacrine</b> caused a negative shift in the voltage dependence of both activation (− 7. 6 mV) and inactivation (− 7. 6 mV).

40|$|Diploid human {{fibroblast}} strains {{were treated}} for 10 min with inhibitors of type I and type II DNA topoisomerases, and after {{removal of the}} inhibitors, the rate of initiation of DNA synthesis at replicon origins was determined. By alkaline elution chromatography, 4 '-(9 -acridinylamino) methanesulfon-m-anisidide (<b>amsacrine),</b> an inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase II, was shown to produce DNA strand breaks. These strand breaks are thought to reflect drug-induced stabilization of topoisomerase-DNA cleavable complexes. Removal of the drug led to a rapid resealing of the strand breaks by dissociation of the complexes. Velocity sedimentation {{analysis was used to}} quantify the effects of <b>amsacrine</b> treatment on DNA replication. It was demonstrated that transient exposure to low concentrations of <b>amsacrine</b> inhibited replicon initiation but did not substantially affect DNA chainelongation within operating replicons. Maximal inhibition of replicon initiation occurred 20 to 30 min after drug treatment, and the initiation rate recovered 30 to 90 min later. Ataxia telangiectasia cells displayed normal levels of amsacrine-induced DNA strand breaks during stabilization of cleavable complexes but failed to downregulate replicon initiation after exposure to the topoisomerase inhibitor. Thus, inhibition of replicon initiation in response to DNA damage appears to be an active process which requires a gene product which is defective or missing in ataxia telangiectasia cells. In normal human fibroblasts, the inhibition of DNA topoisomerase I by camptothecin produced reversible DNA strand breaks. Transient exposure to this drug also inhibited replicon initiation. These results suggest that the cellular response pathway which downregulates replicon initiation following genotoxic damage may respond to perturbations of chromatin structure which accompany stabilization of topoisomerase-DNA cleavable complexes...|$|E
40|$|Cell lines {{resistant}} to adriamycin and <b>amsacrine</b> {{were derived from}} cloned sublines of the human T cell line Jurkat. Most of the lines resemble atypical MDR cells (Danks et al., 1987; Beck et al., 1987). Thus, resistant Jurkat sublines were cross {{resistant to}} several topoisomerase II inhibiting drugs but had low or no resistance to other classes of drugs, resistance was not reversed by verapamil, Pgp was not overexpressed, and drug accumulation was unaltered in resistant compared to parental (control) sublines. Other findings were that anthracycline metabolism differed between resistant and parental sublines, and that resistant sublines displayed altered expression of small polypeptides (less than 20 K MW) and an 85 K MW protein. Drug resistant cells showed resistance {{to the production of}} drug induced cytogenetic aberrations, DNA breaks, and protein-DNA complexes. Resistance was not mediated by altered binding of drugs to DNA or by increased repair of DNA damage. Indirect evidence suggests that the resistant cells had an altered drug-DNA-topoisomerase II association. The study highlights the complex relationships between DNA breaks, cytogenetic aberrations, protein-DNA complexes and drug cytotoxicity, and shows that the relationships differ for adriamycin and <b>amsacrine,</b> suggesting some differences in the modes of action and/or resistance for the drugs and cell lines...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of ICRF- 154 in {{combination}} with 11 anticancer agents on four human leukaemia cell lines. Cells were incubated for 3 days {{in the presence of}} two drugs (ICRF- 154 and one other), and cell growth inhibition was determined by MTT assay. Effects of drug combinations at the ID 50 level were analysed using the isobologram method (Steel). In the lymphoblastic leukaemia cell lines, MOLT- 3, HSB, and B-ALL, supra-additive effects were observed for ICRF- 154 in combination with <b>amsacrine,</b> bleomycin, doxorubicin, and etoposide. Additive effects were observed for its combinations with cisplatin, CPT- 11, cytosine arabinoside, 5 -fluorouracil, mitomycin C, and vincristine. Sub-additive to protective effects were observed in combination with methotrexate. In an erythroleukaemia cell line, K- 562, no drug showed supra-additive effects with ICRF- 154, while sub-additive to protective effects were observed for ICRF- 154 in combination with cisplatin and methotrexate. The other drugs showed additive effects with ICRF- 154. These results indicate that the combined effects of ICRF- 154 with other agents vary, depending on the cell line. Against lymphoid malignancies, ICRF- 154 would be advantageous when administered simultaneously with many anticancer agents. Of such agents, <b>amsacrine,</b> bleomycin, doxorubicin, and etoposide are the most suitable, while methotrexate is least suitable for such combined treatment...|$|E
40|$|In {{the crystal}} {{structure}} of the antimalarial drug amodiaquine, the bonds linking the quinoline and the phenyl groups show partial double-bond character. The partial double-bond character of the two exocyclic bonds, together with stereochemical constraints, reduce flexibility of the two ring systems of the molecule. The dihedral angle between the two ring planes is lowest compared {{to those in the}} antileukaemic drug <b>amsacrine</b> and its derivatives. CPK-modelling studies suggest the way amodiaquine can bind to DNA. Stacking interaction between the quinoline and phenyl groups of independent molecules and the hydrogen-bond network stabilize the crystal structure...|$|E
