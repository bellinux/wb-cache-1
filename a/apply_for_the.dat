30|$|A {{total of}} 200 SMEs were {{successfully}} interviewed {{from the city}} of Chittagong. As Table 7 (Appendix 2) shows, out of the total 200 SMEs, 55.5  % <b>applied</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> loan from formal financial institutions within the last three years and 44.5  % did not apply. This implies that the majority of <b>the</b> firms <b>applied</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> loan due to different reasons. Some of the firms did not want loan. Either they had enough money or they feared to lose their collateral. Again, the majority (51  %) of <b>the</b> SMEs <b>applied</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> loan from banks and only 4.5  % SMEs <b>applied</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> loan from Micro Financial Institutions (MFIs).|$|R

5|$|A {{business}} loop for Indian River {{was first}} proposed to the Cheboygan County Road Commission (CCRC) in June 2015. At the time, the road commission had recently placed the bridge on South Straits Highway over the Indian River {{with a new}} structure up to Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) standards and was repaving the roadway north of the river to the I-75 interchange. The CCRC held a community forum in June 2016, and many local residents and businesses supported the designation at the time. The Tuscarora Township Board and Downtown Development Authority have expressed interesting in paying for the necessary signage should MDOT and the CCRC move forward to <b>apply</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> designation from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

5|$|A {{mandatory}} order is {{an order of}} the High Court commanding a public authority to perform a public duty, while a prohibiting order operates to prevent illegal action by an authority from occurring in the first place. A quashing order, the most commonly sought prerogative order, {{has the effect of}} invalidating an ultra vires decision made by an authority. Obtaining a mandatory, prohibiting or quashing order is a two-stage process, as an applicant must be granted leave by the Court to <b>apply</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> order. The Court must find the existence of a proper public law issue and available grounds of review. Leave will be granted provided that an arguable and prima facie case of reasonable suspicion that the authority has acted in breach of administrative law rules is established.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Brain was {{appointed}} Qantas' Assistant General Manager. Fysh {{was still in}} his early fifties and appeared unlikely to retire any time soon.

Qantas could not match the £2,250 salary associated with the TAA role, and Brain advised Fysh of his resignation on 10April 1946. In the event, ACAC appointed him TAA's General Manager on 3June, with a £3,000 salary and an undertaking to increase this to as much as £5,000 in the future.|$|E

5|$|It {{had long}} been Markham's {{practice}} {{to take note of}} promising young naval officers who might later be suitable for polar responsibilities, should the opportunity arise. He had first observed Midshipman Robert Falcon Scott in 1887, while the latter was serving with HMS Rover in St Kitts, and had remembered him. Thirteen years later, Scott, by now a Torpedo Lieutenant on , was looking for a path to career advancement, and a chance meeting with Sir Clements in London led him to <b>apply</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> leadership of the expedition. Scott {{had long been}} in Markham's mind, though by no means always his first choice, but other favoured candidates had either become in his view too old, or were no longer available. With Markham's determined backing, Scott's appointment was secured by 25 May 1900, followed swiftly by his promotion to Commander.|$|E

5|$|A German mutant with {{a strong}} Catholic faith and the {{appearance}} of a blue demon. Nightcrawler was used by Stryker in an assassination attempt on the President of the United States and gives help to the X-Men. He is capable of teleporting himself (and others) instantly from one location to another. Nightcrawler can teleport through walls, but prefers to only teleport when he can see his landing site. On his body are many scarification marks, one for every sin. Cumming had always been Singer's choice for the role, but at first he was not available due to scheduling conflicts. At some point, Ethan Embry had been reported to be in contention for the role. Ultimately, the film remained in development long enough for Cumming to accept the part. Singer also felt comfortable in casting him since he speaks German fluently. The drawings of Adam Kubert were used as inspiration for Nightcrawler's makeup design, which took four hours to <b>apply.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> scene where Nightcrawler has his shirt off, Cumming went through nine hours of makeup. To best pose as Nightcrawler, Cumming studied comic books and illustrations of the character.|$|E

5|$|If a {{mandatory}} order, prohibiting order or quashing order is sought, the applicant must follow the procedure {{set out in}} Order 53 of the Rules of Court. In general, there are two stages. At the first stage, an applicant must obtain leave to <b>apply</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> prerogative order. This requirement prevents unmeritorious applications from being taken against decision-makers by filtering out groundless cases {{at an early stage}} to prevent wastage of judicial time, and protects public bodies from harassment, intentional or otherwise. An application for such leave must be made by ex parte originating summons and must be supported by a statement setting out the name and description of the applicant, the relief sought and the grounds on which it is sought; and by an affidavit, to be filed when the application is made, verifying the facts relied on. In granting leave, the judge hearing the application for leave may impose such terms as to costs and as to security as he or she thinks fit.|$|E

5|$|On 10 February, Bergen Aviation {{announced}} that they had applied the Norwegian Civil Aviation Administration to operate a scheduled service between Flesland and Oslo Airport, Fornebu. At the time, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) had a monopoly on the route, which was Norway's busiest, carrying 2,000 to 3,000 passengers per day. Einar Falck, Vesta's chief executive officer, stated that the mechanics' strike which had recently hit SAS had shown how vulnerable the SAS monopoly was. He further stated that should Bergen Aviation receive concession, they would acquire Boeing 737 or Douglas DC-9 aircraft for the route, and the owner group would consider listing the company. The application {{was part of a}} trend among smaller Norwegian airlines to <b>apply</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> new route. At the time there were 42 pending applications from 15 airlines awaiting decision in the Ministry of Transport and Communications.
