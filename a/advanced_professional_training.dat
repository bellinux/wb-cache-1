Fifty-four elementary school biology teachers from Novi Sad participated in the study. The findings suggested that the teachers generally had positive attitudes toward CAL in biology teaching.

40|$|In {{light of}} the {{prominent}} role of socio-materiality in contemporary social scientific (Nicolini, 2012), and particularly educational (Fenwick, Edwards & Sawchuck, 2011) research, this paper uses two practice-based theories to investigate the experiences of German business management professionals on a UK based DBA delivered in Germany. We specifically take concepts from Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT; Engeström, 2001) and Actor Network Theory (ANT; Latour, 2005; Law, 2009) to explore the evolving relationships between professional and academic identities as revealed in qualitative interviews with individual students and supervising faculty. The discussion underlines the potential of these theories to produce rich understandings of the identity formation of researching professionals. We conclude that professional doctorates should be seen not just as specific forms of <b>advanced</b> <b>professional</b> <b>training,</b> but as complex and indeterminate processes. Findings suggest that earning a professional doctorate often feels like a journey leading {{to some form of}} metacognitive shift from a problem-solving mindset to a more critical appreciation of different ways of knowing...|$|E
