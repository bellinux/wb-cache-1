5|$|British {{discipline}} of the First World War was not especially severe compared to most other armies of the time (e.g. the Russians and Italians).

5|$|Marie {{noted that}} Dempsey was {{disappointed}} in the lack of tactical flair shown by Brigadier Hinde throughout the battle and that the British {{should have known better}} than to attempt an armoured advance unsupported by infantry in the bocage.

5|$|On 16 February, a major German attack {{struck the}} 45th, and nearly {{broke through the}} 179th Infantry on 18 February. Lucas sent famed U.S. Army Ranger leader Colonel William Orlando Darby to assume command of the 157th Infantry, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> were repulsed.

5|$|On 21 August, Taskforce Butler {{occupied}} the hills {{north of the}} town of Montélimar, according to revised orders from Truscott, as he considered it too weak to block the entire German force marching north. From this position, Taskforce Butler fired on the evacuating German troops, while waiting for further reinforcements. Troops from the FFI supported the Americans, harassing German troops through the entire battle. The sudden appearance of this new threat shocked Wiese and the German command. As a first countermeasure, Wietersheim's 11thPanzer Division was called in. The first of its units to arrive, together with several ad-hoc Luftwaffe battle groups, were tasked to deal with this new threat. This hastily assembled force mounted an attack against Puy the same day, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> were able to isolate Taskforce Butler from supplies. This success was, however, short-lived, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> were pushed back soon after.|$|E
5|$|Pećanac was {{eventually}} denounced as a traitor by the Yugoslav government-in-exile, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> concluded that his detachments were inefficient, unreliable, and of little {{military aid to}} them.

5|$|At 03:00, the 8th Heavy Company, 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment with 75mm SP guns, 20mm AA guns, and mortars {{attacked}} 'A' and 'C' Companies, 7th Parachute Battalion, {{from the}} south. The paratroops were forced back <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> established their own positions in Bénouville, but {{were unable to}} break the British line.

5|$|At 21:50 the British {{artillery}} opened fire, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> {{responded with}} their own artillery and mortars which forced most of the British to take cover, for the next fifteen minutes, until a lull in the German fire allowed them to continue. In the lead 'C' Company had crossed the start line at 22:00, however all its officers and the company sergeant major (CSM) became casualties and a senior non-commissioned officer took command of the company. They continued to advance through the artillery and mortar bombardment, guided towards their objective by tracer rounds from the Hussars tanks.

5|$|Final {{assembly}} for the A321 would be, as a {{first for}} any Airbus, carried out in Germany (then West Germany). This came after a dispute between the French, who claimed the move would incur $150million (€135 million) in unnecessary expenditure associated with the new plant, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans,</b> arguing {{it would be more}} productive for Airbus in the long run. The second production line was located at Hamburg, which would also subsequently produce the smaller Airbus A319 and A318. For the first time, Airbus entered the bond market, through which it raised $480million (€475 million) to finance development costs. An additional $180million (€175 million) was borrowed from European Investment Bank and private investors.|$|E
5|$|Hans Dominik {{became the}} Jaunde post {{commander}} in 1904. For {{the next six}} years, Atangana accompanied him on at least fifteen administrative patrols and probative excursions. Atangana proved an astute diplomat, in one case negotiating {{with a group of}} rebellious Manguissa and thus averting a confrontation between the tribesmen <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans.</b> Atangana helped open posts in such wide-ranging places as Bafia, Abong-Mbang, Mouloudou, Ngaoundéré, Garoua, and Maroua. The Germans largely kept themselves segregated from their African subjects, but Dominik and Atangana defied these standards and grew close, even dining together in the same tent on occasion. Back in Jaunde, Atangana gained responsibilities valued by the regime, such as overseeing a poll tax in October 1908.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} years of the silent film era, from the 1890s, films were {{generally}} accompanied by live music, often improvised, provided by piano or pump organ. In the early 20th century, larger cinemas began to use orchestras, which would accompany the film with out-of-copyright classical pieces or, increasingly, with original compositions. The score for the 1916 classic The Birth of a Nation, compiled by Joseph Carl Breil from various classical works and some original writing, was a landmark in film music, and inspired notable composers of the day to provide scores for silent films. Among these were the Americans Victor Herbert and Mortimer Wilson, from France Darius Milhaud and Arthur Honegger, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> Gottfried Huppertz and Edmund Meisel.|$|E

5|$|MacLachlan's stay was unhappy. On 19 April 1943 he {{received}} news {{that his brother}} Gordon MacLachlan had been shot down over Brest, France while escorting B-24 bombers. They were intercepted by Focke-Wulf Fw 190s belonging to 1./Jagdgeschwader 2. Unteroffizier Erich Henning and Hauptmann Jürgen Heppe each claimed a Spitfire. 616 Squadron lost Gordon and Squadron leader Pip Lefevre. Lefevre survived and evaded capture, returning to Britain via Gibraltar. Gordon was killed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> recovered the body and buried him at Plouguerneau.

5|$|Ninety-seven British {{prisoners were}} killed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> forced French civilians {{to bury the}} bodies in a shallow mass grave the next day.

5|$|The British {{squadron}} {{spotted the}} Germans at 05:37 (ship's clocks were set four hours ahead of local time – the engagement commenced shortly after dawn), but the Germans were already {{aware of their}} presence, Prinz Eugens hydrophones having previously detected the sounds of high-speed propellers to their southeast. The British opened fire at 05:52 with Hood engaging Prinz Eugen, the lead ship in the German formation, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> returned fire at 05:55, both ships concentrating on Hood. Prinz Eugen was probably the first ship to score when a shell hit Hoods boat deck, between her funnels, and started a large fire among the ready-use ammunition for the anti-aircraft guns and rockets of the UP mounts.|$|E

5|$|The {{tactical}} methods {{had been}} {{tested by the}} Australians in a local counter-attack at the Battle of Hamel on 4 July.
