5|$|After {{playing in}} the 60 games, Tipton was {{suspended}} after an argument with Chickasaws manager Jack Cassini, and after the season ended {{he retired from the}} game to work at his service station. He returned to baseball in 1957 and spent a season with the Birmingham Barons, and partway through the 1958 season, he joined the Panama City Fliers as manager. He was fired a month later, and in protest the Fliers refused to play their next game. Tipton retired afterwards, and a year later was banned for life from the minor leagues after it came to light that he accepted payouts by acting as a liaison for Jesse Levan, who was intentionally fouling off balls in order for gamblers in the stands to take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{employing}} {{a system that}} returned men by units, or by employment categories, {{it was decided to}} utilise an egalitarian system that saw men who had been away for the longest period of time being returned first. Due {{to the size of the}} forces deployed overseas—roughly 167, 000 personnel in France, Britain and Egypt—and the logistical requirements of bringing them home the process was nevertheless a lengthy one and as such it became important to occupy the troops while they waited. In order to achieve this and to prepare the men for a return to civilian employment, a vocational education scheme was set up by George Long and troops in Britain were offered educational courses and civilian work placement opportunities and although these programs were not as successful as hoped, several thousand soldiers took <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

Grant, writing in his memoirs long after the event, stated {{that he did not have}} great confidence that any of them would prove successful, although he was prepared to take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> if they did.

25|$|The {{education}} reform efforts of women like Davies and the Langham group slowly made inroads. Queen's College (1848) and Bedford College (1849) in London began {{to offer some}} education to women from 1848. By 1862, Davies established a committee to persuade the universities to allow women to sit for the recently established Local Examinations, and achieved partial success in 1865. She published The Higher Education of Women a year later. Davies and Leigh Smith founded the first higher educational institution for women and enrolled five students. The school later became Girton College, Cambridge in 1869, Newnham College, Cambridge in 1871, and Lady Margaret Hall at Oxford in 1879. Bedford began to award degrees the previous year. Despite these measurable advances, few could take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> and life for female students was still difficult.|$|E

At 2 a.m., Buell and Gilbert, the III Corps commander, ordered newly promoted Brig. Gen. Phil Sheridan to seize Peters Hill; Sheridan started off with the brigade of Col. Daniel McCook (the younger brother of the I Corps commander). Sheridan seized the hill, driving the Arkansans back to the main line of their brigade, but continued to push across the creek. Liddell's brigade could not check the momentum of Sheridan's thirsty soldiers and Buckner, Lidell's division commander, was ordered by Polk not to reinforce him, but to pull his brigade back. Polk was concerned about starting a general engagement {{to the west of the}} Chaplin River, fearing he was outnumbered.

500|$|William Seward {{was sworn}} in as Governor of New York on January 1, 1839, and inaugurated in front of a crowd of jubilant Whigs. [...] In that era, the annual message by the New York {{governor}} was published and discussed to the extent of that of a president. Seward biographer Walter Stahr wrote that his address [...] "brimmed with his youth, energy, ambition, and optimism". Seward took note of America's great unexploited resources, and stated that immigration should be encouraged in order to take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> He urged that citizenship and religious liberty be granted to those who came to New York's shores. At the time, New York City's public schools were run by Protestants, and used Protestant texts, including the King James Bible. Seward believed the current system was a barrier to literacy for immigrants' children, and proposed legislation to change it. Education, he stated, [...] "banishes the distinctions, old as time, of rich and poor, master and slave. It banishes ignorance and lays axe to the root of crime". Seward's stance was popular among immigrants, but was disliked by nativists; their opposition would eventually help defeat his bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 1860.|$|E
500|$|Castillo Armas's {{government}} {{launched a}} concerted campaign against trade unionists. Some {{of the most}} severe violence was directed at workers on the plantations of the United Fruit Company. The government also attempted to reverse the agrarian reform project initiated by Árbenz, and large areas of land were seized from the agrarian laborers who had received them under Árbenz and given to large landowners. In only a few isolated instances were peasants able to retain their lands. Castillo Armas's reversal of Árbenz's agrarian reforms led the US embassy to comment {{that it was a}} [...] "long step backwards" [...] from the previous policy. Thousands of peasants who attempted to remain on the lands they had received from Árbenz were arrested by the Guatemalan police. Some peasants were arrested under the pretext that they were communists, though very few of them were. Few of these arrested peasants were ever convicted, but landlords used the arrests to evict peasants from their land. The government under Castillo Armas issued two ordinances related to agricultural policy. In theory, these decrees promised to protect the grants of land made by the Árbenz government under Decree900. The decrees also allowed landowners to petition for the return of land seized [...] "illegally". However, the repressive atmosphere at the time in which the decrees were passed meant that very few peasants could take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> In total, of the 529,939 manzanas of land expropriated under Decree900, 368,481 were taken from peasants and returned to landowners. Ultimately, however, Castillo Armas did not go as far towards restoring the power and privileges of his upper-class and business constituency as they would have liked.
