The firm’s objective is to maximize its <b>adjusted</b> <b>value,</b> which {{is the sum of}} the market value and the shareholders’ surplus from their trades in the stock markets. If a firm maximizes its <b>adjusted</b> <b>value,</b> then its financial policy is relevant (i. e., Modigliani-Miller theorem does not hold), equilibrium outcomes are stable to shareholders’ renegotiation and endogenously incomplete markets typically arise at the equilibrium. If the firm is competitive in the financial markets, the <b>adjusted</b> <b>value</b> coincides with the Grossman-Hart objective. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper formalizes {{certain aspects}} of the sales {{comparison}} approach to valuation that heretofore have been quite ad hoc. Specifically, it applies statistical theory to decisions about how many comparables to select, what the criteria for comparable selection should be, and how the proper weights for each <b>adjusted</b> <b>value</b> estimate can be determined such that the final value estimate is both unbiased and of minimum variance. Several results are derived that run counter to conventional practice; for example, it may not always be optimal to consider first the "best" comparables {{because of a lack of}} independence among their <b>adjusted</b> <b>value</b> estimates. Furthermore, it is always desirable to consider more comparables (regardless of how "bad") so long as their <b>adjusted</b> <b>value</b> estimates are optimally weighted in the final value estimate. Finally, weights usually selected for "inferior" comparables are typically too small. A final exercise empirically applies the methodology to a sample of sales.

50|$|In {{statistics}} and applications of statistics, normalization {{can have a}} range of meanings. In the simplest cases, normalization of ratings means <b>adjusting</b> <b>values</b> measured on different scales to a notionally common scale, often prior to averaging. In more complicated cases, normalization may refer to more sophisticated adjustments where the intention is to bring the entire probability distributions of <b>adjusted</b> <b>values</b> into alignment. In the case of normalization of scores in educational assessment, there may be an intention to align distributions to a normal distribution. A different approach to normalization of probability distributions is quantile normalization, where the quantiles of the different measures are brought into alignment.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{demonstrates}} a new adjustment method {{together with a}} very effective gross-error detection in the space resection and in the on-line aerial triangulation. The basic concept {{is well known for}} more than one hundred years, the only problem was that the algorithm is very complex and the implementation was very time consuming without modern computers. Now this barrier doesn’t exist any more. The <b>adjusted</b> <b>value</b> of the unknowns can be derived from the weighted mean value of solutions gained from minimally necessary number of control points and it is done in every combination. For example if we have five control points to solve the space resection, we can solve this task grouping three control points in every combination, and by this way we can calculate the orientation elements in ten different combinations. In this case the <b>adjusted</b> <b>value</b> of the unknowns will be the weighted mean value following the Jacobian Mean Theorem. Why is it necessary to follow this way? Because we can pick up very effectively the points with a value of gross-error and it can be done before getting the <b>adjusted</b> <b>value,</b> which is a very remarkable issue comparing with the least square method or the robust estimators. In practice, the first task is to determine the outer orientation elements, for this we usually use the collinear equations, which needs initial values of unknowns and an iteration process. In this paper I present a direct solution to solve the space resection in photogrammetry using geometrical considerations on the basis of three control points. The method doesn’t need initial values an...|$|R

We evaluated the association between peritoneal solute transport rate (PSTR) and effluent markers related to EMT with <b>adjusted</b> <b>values</b> for effluent cancer antigen 125 (CA 125). Methods. One hundred five incident peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients on PD for 25 (12 – 68) months with biocompatible solutions {{were included in the}} study. Fast peritoneal equilibration test was used to evaluate PSTR. Effluent hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), bone morphogenic protein- 7 (BMP- 7), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), and CA 125 at 4 [*]h were measured. Results. Patients with dialysate/plasma creatinine ≧ 0. 82 showed significantly higher effluent HGF (240 versus 133 [*]pg/mL, <. 001), VEGF, IL- 6, and IL 6 /CA 125 levels than the others but no significant differences in effluent HGF/CA 125, BMP- 7, and BMP 7 /CA 125 were observed.

40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVE: Spot urine {{samples were}} {{investigated}} to determine correlations between urinary creatinine and specific gravity, and intra- and inter-day variations other than gender- and age-dependence of urinary concentrations. METHODS: Urinary creatinine concentrations and specific gravity were determined in 534 spot samples (385 from men and 149 from women). Subjects' ages ranged between 18 and 68 years. Spot urine samples were also collected from 14 male subjects {{before and after}} a 1 -week work-shift {{for the evaluation of}} intra- and inter-day variations of creatinine and specific gravity. RESULTS: In spot samples, creatinine concentrations ranged between 0. 16 and 4. 36 g/l and specific gravity between 1. 002 and 1. 037. A high correlation (r = 0. 82, P < 0. 001) was observed between creatinine and specific gravity; male subjects showed significantly higher values of creatinine (P < 0. 001) than did female subjects (1. 90 +/- 0. 74 and 1. 41 +/- 0. 72 g/l, respectively) and specific gravity (1. 023 +/- 0. 006 and 1. 020 +/- 0. 007, respectively). In addition, creatinine but not specific gravity significantly decreased (P < 0. 02) in subjects older than 50 years, compared with those under 40. CONCLUSIONS: Results confirm the gender-dependence of creatinine concentrations in spot specimens and also show age-dependence, indicating the need for these aspects to be considered when the range of acceptable samples is to be set. No significant intra- or inter-day variations were observed for the two parameters. Lastly, the possibility of a comparison of differently <b>adjusted</b> <b>values</b> was indicated by a conversion formula derived from adjustments to creatinine and the corresponding specific gravity of a hypothetical urinary value, as follows: specific gravity <b>adjusted</b> <b>values</b> = 1. 48 x creatinine <b>adjusted</b> <b>values...</b>|$|R
