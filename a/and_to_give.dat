5|$|An Indian {{resistance}} movement against U.S. expansion {{had been growing}} through {{the leadership of the}} Shawnee brothers, Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa (The Prophet). The conflict became known as Tecumseh's War. Tenskwatawa convinced the native tribes that they would be protected by the Great Spirit and no harm could befall them if they would rise up against the white settlers. He encouraged resistance by telling the tribes to pay white traders only half of what they owed <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up all the white man's ways, including their clothing, muskets, and especially whiskey, which was becoming known as evil for American Indians.|$|E

5|$|A similar {{initiative}} {{came from}} Norman Pierre Gentieu (1914â€“2009), an American writer who discovered Sorabji by reading his book Around Music {{just after the}} Second World War. Because of the post-war shortages in England, Gentieu sent Sorabji some provisions, {{and the depth of}} their friendship appears to have been such that he continued to do so for the next four decades. In the early 1950s Gentieu made an offer to Sorabji to pay for the microfilming of his major piano works <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> some copies to selected libraries. All of his unpublished musical manuscripts were eventually microfilmed. Gentieu also sent Sorabji a tape recorder to record some of his music, but Sorabji did not do so.|$|E

5|$|All swifts feed on insects {{caught in}} flight, and the Pacific swift has been {{recorded}} as consuming bees, wasps, termites, moths and flies. A Chinese study found that it caught {{a wide variety of}} insect prey and considered that most of the species eaten were harmful to agriculture or forestry. The Pacific swift tends to hunt higher than sympatric swifts, sharing its airspace mainly with white-throated needletails. It typically feeds at heights up to , only flying close to the ground in poor weather. It often forages near low-pressure areas, which serve both to raise insects from the ground <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the swifts additional lift. The swifts circle through the insect swarms in flocks typically of tens or hundreds of birds, although sometimes reaching tens of thousands in Australia. In Siberia, Pacific swifts feed at dusk to much later hours than the common swift, sometimes until midnight, and migrants have been seen flying with bats in the Philippines. The young are brought balls of insects bound with saliva. In bad weather, they are sometimes not fed for days, surviving on stored body fat.|$|E

He encouraged resistance by telling the tribes to only pay white traders half of what they owed, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up all the white man's ways, including their clothing, whiskey, and guns. In 1810, Tecumseh, with about 400 armed warriors, traveled to Vincennes where he confronted Harrison and demanded that the Treaty of Fort Wayne be rescinded. Although Harrison refused, the war party left peacefully, but Tecumseh was angry and threatened retaliation. After the meeting Tecumseh journeyed to meet with many of the tribes in the region, hoping to create a confederation with which to battle the Americans.|$|E
5|$|At present, some 192 spells are known, {{though no}} single {{manuscript}} contains them all. They served {{a range of}} purposes. Some are intended to give the deceased mystical knowledge in the afterlife, or perhaps to identify them with the gods: for instance, Spell 17 is an obscure and lengthy description of the god Atum. Others are incantations to ensure the different elements of the dead person's being were preserved and reunited, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the deceased control over the world around him. Still others protect the deceased from various hostile forces or guide him through the underworld past various obstacles. Famously, two spells also deal with the judgement of the deceased in the Weighing of the Heart ritual.|$|E

5|$|In 1869, Grant was {{urged by}} popular opinion to support rebels in Cuba with {{military}} assistance <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> them U.S. diplomatic recognition. Grant and Fish instead attempted to use arbitration with Spain with minister Daniel Sickles negotiating. Grant and Fish wanted Cuban independence and to end slavery without U.S. military intervention or occupation. Fish, diligently and against popular pressure, {{was able to}} keep Grant from officially recognizing Cuban independence because it would have endangered negotiations with Britain over the Alabama Claims. The Sickle's peace negotiations failed in Madrid, but Grant and Fish did not succumb to popular pressure for U.S. military involvement in the Cuban rebellion. Grant and Fish sent a message to Congress, written by Fish and signed by Grant. The message urged strict neutrality not to officially recognize the Cuban revolt, calming national fears.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Levesque's {{role as an}} Executive Senior Advisor {{was officially}} formalized as he was given an office at WWE {{headquarters}} in Stamford, Connecticut. Levesque was named Executive Vice President, Talent and Live events in 2011. In this role he oversees the talent relations and talent development departments, training of performers and management of worldwide recruitment. Levesque's role within {{the company has been}} under much criticism since 2003, as many fans and some wrestlers view {{it as a way to}} keep him on top on-screen <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> him more television time.

Additionally, Levesque has been credited for losing in high-profile matches that helped elevate the careers of younger wrestlers including John Cena, Randy Orton, Batista, Jeff Hardy, Brock Lesnar, Daniel Bryan and Roman Reigns.|$|E
5|$|In March 1081, Melissenos was encamped {{with his}} army at Damalis, on the Asian shore across the Bosporus from Constantinople. There, he {{received}} {{news of the}} revolt of the Komnenoi against Botaneiates and the proclamation of Alexios Komnenos as emperor. He sent letters to the Komnenoi, suggesting a division of authority over the imperial territory, with the Balkans remaining under Komnenian control and himself keeping Asia Minor, although he also emphasized that the Byzantine Empire should remain united. In reply, the Komnenoi offered to recognize him as Caesar â€“ the second highest dignity after the imperial title itself â€“ <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> him the governance of Thessalonica â€“ the Empire's second-most important city â€“ if he would submit to them. Melissenos initially refused to accept this offer, but as the Komnenoi {{were on the verge}} of taking Constantinople and might refuse to make similar concessions later, he eventually agreed.|$|E

5|$|In early September 1940, the Italian 10th Army {{based in}} Libya {{conducted}} the Italian invasion of Egypt {{and three months}} later, the British and Commonwealth troops of the Western Desert Force began a counter-offensive, codenamed Operation Compass. In two months, the British advanced , occupying the Italian province of Cyrenaica and destroying the 10th Army. The advance was halted in February 1941 because of supply shortages <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> priority to the Battle of Greece. Renamed XIII Corps and reorganised under HQ Cyrenaica Command (CYRCOM), the troops of the former Western Desert Force adopted a defensive posture. Over the next few months, HQ Cyrenaica lost its commander, Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson, followed by the 2nd New Zealand Division and the 6th Australian Division when they were sent to Greece in Operation Lustre. The 7th Armoured Division, with virtually no serviceable tanks left, was also withdrawn {{and sent to the}} Nile Delta for rest and refitting. Wilson was replaced by Lieutenant-General Philip Neame; parts of the 2nd Armoured Division and 9th Australian Division were deployed to Cyrenaica but both formations were inexperienced, ill-equipped {{and in the case of}} the 2nd Armoured Division, well under strength, after detachments to Greece.|$|E
5|$|John Manners died in 1402, {{probably}} {{leaving the}} castle to his son, Robert, {{who in turn}} left the property to his own son, another John Manners. John {{was involved in a}} long-running feud with the neighbouring Heron family, who owned the neighbouring Ford Castle, and on 20 January 1428 there was a fight between the two sides outside Etal Castle, in which William Heron died. The precise events are unclear and formed the basis of a subsequent lawsuit, but John argued that William had assaulted the castle, during which attack he had died, and that John had no direct involvement in his death. William's widow blamed John and his eldest son, also called John, for William's death and demanded compensation. After arbitration by the Church, eventually John agreed to pay for 500 masses for William's soul, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> 250 marks to his widow.|$|E
5|$|Las Casas's first {{proposed}} remedy {{was a complete}} moratorium {{on the use of}} Indian labor in the Indies until such time as better regulations of it were set in place. This was meant simply to halt the decimation of the Indian population <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the surviving Indians time to reconstitute themselves. Las Casas feared that at the rate the exploitation was proceeding it would be too late to hinder their annihilation unless action were taken rapidly. The second was a change in the labor policy so that instead of a colonist owning the labor of specific Indians, he would have a right to man-hours, to be carried out by no specific persons. This required the establishment of self-governing Indian communities on the land of colonists â€“ who would themselves organize to provide the labor for their patron. The colonist would only have rights to a certain portion of the total labor, so that a part of the Indians were always resting and taking care of the sick. He proposed 12 other remedies, all having the specific aim of improving the situation for the Indians and limiting the powers that colonists were able to exercise over them.|$|E
