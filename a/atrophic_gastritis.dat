25|$|Absorption of food vitamin B12 thus {{requires}} an intact and functioning stomach, exocrine pancreas, intrinsic factor, and small bowel. Problems with {{any one of}} these organs makes a vitamin B12 deficiency possible. Individuals who lack intrinsic factor have a decreased ability to absorb B12. In pernicious anemia, {{there is a lack of}} IF due to autoimmune <b>atrophic</b> <b>gastritis,</b> in which antibodies form against parietal cells. Antibodies may alternately form against and bind to IF, inhibiting it from carrying out its B12 protective function. Due to the complexity of B12 absorption, geriatric patients, many of whom are hypoacidic due to reduced parietal cell function, have an increased risk of B12 deficiency. This results in 80–100% excretion of oral doses in the feces versus 30–60% excretion in feces as seen in individuals with adequate IF.|$|E
2500|$|Gastric {{diseases}} {{refer to}} diseases affecting the stomach.

When gastritis persists in a chronic state, it is associated with several diseases, including <b>atrophic</b> <b>gastritis,</b> pyloric stenosis, and gastric cancer. Another common condition is gastric ulceration, peptic ulcers. Ulceration erodes the gastric mucosa, which protects the tissue of the stomach from the stomach acids.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the occurrence of}} and risk factors for autoimmune thyroid disease in <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> patients. Methods: Cross-sectional study on 401 consecutive outpatients with <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis.</b> Diagnostic work-up of thyroid disease was completed in 319 <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> patients (225 women, median age 55. 5 years [range 17 - 95 years]). Data on anagraphics, lifestyle, family history, and biochemical and histological items were obtained at baseline, and associations between <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> and autoimmune and nonautoimmune thyroid diseases were explored through descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses. Results: Of the 319 <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> patients, 169 (53 %) had an associated thyroid disorder, and 89 (52. 7 %) of these were unaware of it. The thyroid disease was autoimmune in 128 patients (75. 7 %) and nonautoimmune in 41 patients. Logistic regression showed that risk factors for having autoimmune thyroid disease in <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> patients were female sex (odds ratio [OR] 5. 6, 95 % confidence interval [CI], 2. 6 - 12. 1), presence of parietal cell antibodies (OR 2. 5, 95 % CI, 1. 1 - 5. 5), and presence of metaplastic atrophy (OR 2. 2, 95 % CI, 1. 0 - 5. 0). Conclusions: Autoimmune thyroid disease and <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> occur in a closely linked fashion, suggesting that <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> patients should be investigated for an occult autoimmune thyroid disease, in particular women and those with positive parietal cell antibodies. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: <b>Atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> {{patients}} are {{at increased risk}} for gastric cancer. IL- 1 B/IL- 1 RN polymorphisms have been associated with gastric cancer susceptibility. The relationship between these polymorphisms and the long-term outcome of <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> patients is not known. AIM: To investigate whether the genotyping of IL- 1 B- 511 /IL- 1 RN polymorphisms is useful to characterize <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> patients at increased risk for gastric neoplasms. METHODS: IL- 1 B- 511 /IL- 1 RN polymorphisms were compared between 110 <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> patients and 110 age- and gender-matched controls, and patients were followed up (median 4. 1 years) according to a cohort study design. RESULTS: Genotype frequencies of IL- 1 B- 511 /IL- 1 RN were similar between patients and controls. <b>Atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> patients harbouring the wild type of IL- 1 B- 511 /IL- 1 RN polymorphisms were not different from those harbouring the proinflammatory pattern as far as regards gender, age, gastric cancer family history and metaplastic atrophy. Sixteen <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> patients developed a gastric neoplastic lesion at follow-up: eight were IL- 1 B- 511 -T carriers and eight were IL- 1 RN-allele- 2 carriers. Harbouring the proinflammatory genotypes was not significantly associated with developing gastric neoplastic lesions. CONCLUSIONS: In <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> patients, IL- 1 B- 511 and IL- 1 RN polymorphisms {{do not appear to be}} associated either with specific clinical, biochemical or histological features or with the development of gastric neoplastic lesions at long-term follow-up...|$|R
40|$|Background: Benign {{epithelial}} gastric polyps {{have been}} reported to be more common in <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis.</b> The role of Helicobacter pylori infection in the induction of gastric atrophy is well-known. The development of hyperplastic polyps may be in relation to H. pylori infection. Aim: To investigate occurrence of benign epithelial gastric polyps in <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> patients at diagnosis and follow-up, and the role of H. pylori and other risk factors for the development of benign epithelial gastric polyps. Methods: A total of 259 consecutive <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> patients included in a follow-up programme, of whom 202 were followed up for median period of 4 years (range: 2 - 11). At baseline and follow-up gastroscopies, the presence of benign epithelial gastric polyps was evaluated. Biopsies for histology were obtained from all detected benign epithelial gastric polyps. Results: Frequency of benign epithelial gastric polyps in <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> patients were 4. 6 % at baseline and 5. 9 % at follow-up. About 91. 7 % were hyperplastic polyps. H. pylori infection was detected in 79. 2 % <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> patients with benign epithelial gastric polyps, and in 70. 8 % without benign epithelial gastric polyps. Smoking was more frequent among patients with benign epithelial gastric polyps [42 % vs. 20 %, OR 2. 8 (95 % CI: 1. 2 - 6. 9) ]. Conclusions: Benign epithelial gastric polyps occur in about 5 % of <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> patients, and the vast majority are hyperplastic polyps. Smoking habit, but not H. pylori infection, increases the risk for benign epithelial gastric polyps in <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> patients...|$|R
2500|$|Gastric cancer {{develops}} within areas (field defects) of {{the stomach}} with <b>atrophic</b> <b>gastritis</b> and intestinal metaplasia: these lesions represent the cancerization ﬁeld in which (intestinal-type) gastric cancers develop. [...] In one study, the field defect was clearly demonstrated in gastric carcinogenesis using miRNA high throughput data from normal gastric mucosa (from patients who {{had never had a}} gastric malignant neoplasm), non-tumor tissue adjacent to a gastric cancer, and gastric cancer tissue. Greater than 5-fold reductions were found in four miRNAs in tumor-adjacent tissues and gastric cancers as compared to those miRNA levels in normal gastric tissues.|$|E
2500|$|Mucous gland metaplasia, the {{reversible}} {{replacement of}} differentiated cells, {{occurs in the}} setting of severe damage of the gastric glands, which then waste away (<b>atrophic</b> <b>gastritis)</b> and are progressively replaced by mucous glands. Gastric ulcers may develop; it is unclear if they are the causes or the consequences. [...] Intestinal metaplasia typically begins in response to chronic mucosal injury in the antrum, and may extend to the body. Gastric mucosa cells change to resemble intestinal mucosa and may even assume absorptive characteristics. Intestinal metaplasia is classified histologically as complete or incomplete. With complete metaplasia, gastric mucosa is completely transformed into small-bowel mucosa, both histologically and functionally, with the ability to absorb nutrients and secrete peptides. In incomplete metaplasia, the epithelium assumes a histologic appearance closer to that of the large intestine and frequently exhibits dysplasia.|$|E

40|$|Background. Detection of Helicobacter pylori {{infection}} in <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> (ABG) is difficult, as during progression of body atrophy, H. pylori disappears. Aim. To increase the diagnostic yield of detection of active H. pylori {{infection in}} <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> patients by using noninvasive tests such as 13 C-Urea Breath Test (13 C-UBT) and H. pylori stool antigen test (HpSA) would be useful. Patients. 27 consecutive patients with newlydiagnosed <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> (19 F/ 7 M, age 27 – 73 years). Methods. Gastroscopy with biopsies (antrum n = 3, body n = 3) and histology according to updated Sydney system, H. pylori IgG serology, 13 C-UBT, and HpSA. Results. All tests {{used in the}} diagnosis of H. pylori infection were in agreement in 9 / 27 <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> patients (33. 3 %), being all positive in four (14. 8 %) and all negative in five patients (18. 5 %). Ten of the 27 (37 %) patients were Giemsa stain-positive and serology-positive (group I). Seventeen of the 27 (63 %) patients were Giemsa stain-negative: 5 / 17 with positive serology (group II) and 12 / 17 with negative serology (group III). In group I, 5 / 10 (50 %) were 13 C-UBT positive and 4 / 10 (40 %) HpSA positive. In group II, two patients were 13 C-UBT positive, but all were HpSA negative. Also in group III, all patients were HpSA negative, but one had a positive 13 C-UBT. Conclusions. In <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> patients, neither 13 C-UBT nor HpSA per se add useful information regarding active H. pylori infection, but these noninvasive tests may be important in combination with histology and serology to define the H. pylori status in some <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> patients.

40|$|<b>Atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> is {{considered}} an outcome of H. pylori infection {{at high risk for}} gastric cancer. Immunoproteomics has been used to detect H. pylori antigens, which may act as potential markers for neoplastic disease and may be used in specific serological tests. We used immunoproteome technology to identify H. pylori antigens, recognized by sera from patients with <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis.</b> Here, we performed 2 DE protein maps of H. pylori strain 10 K, probed against single sera from 3 groups of H. pylori-positive patients (atrophic body gastritis; intestinal-type gastric cancer; peptic ulcer) and negative controls. Immunoreactive spots were identified by MALDI-TOF-MS. A total of 155 immunoreactive spots were detected corresponding to 14. 1 % of total spots detected in our reference map of H. pylori strain 10 K. Sera from <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> (40. 5 ± 2 %) and gastric cancer patients (25. 9 ± 1. 8 %) showed a significantly higher and stronger mean immunoreactivity versus H. pylori antigens compared to peptic ulcer patients (11. 2 ± 1. 3 %). The average intensity of immunoreactivity of sera from <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> and gastric cancer patients was significantly stronger compared to peptic ulcer patients. Sera from <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> and gastric cancer patients differentially recognized 17 H. pylori spots.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} artificial neural networks in predicting the presence of thyroid disease in <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> patients. METHODS: A dataset of 29 input variables of 253 <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> patients was applied to artificial neural networks (ANNs) using a data optimisation procedure (standard ANNs, T&T-IS protocol, TWIST protocol). The target variable was the presence of thyroid disease. RESULTS: Standard ANNs obtained a mean accuracy of 64. 4 % with a sensitivity of 69 % and a specificity of 59. 8 % in recognizing <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> patients with thyroid disease. The optimization procedures (T&T-IS and TWIST protocol) improved {{the performance of the}} recognition task yielding a mean accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 74. 7 % and 75. 8 %, 78. 8 % and 81. 8 %, and 70. 5 % and 69. 9 %, respectively. The increase of sensitivity of the TWIST protocol was statistically significant compared to T&T-IS. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that artificial neural networks may be taken into consideration as a potential clinical decision-support tool for identifying ABG patients at risk for harbouring an unknown thyroid disease and thus requiring diagnostic work-up of their thyroid status.

METHODS: (13) Carbon urea breath testing and serology were compared with H. pylori culture of a corpus biopsy as reference test. RESULTS: All tests were in agreement in 12 patients, being all positive in six and all negative in six. One patient was positive for serology and culture but negative for (13) carbon urea breath testing, five patients had only positive serology and two patients had only positive (13) carbon urea breath testing. (13) Carbon urea breath testing showed an accuracy with culture of 85 % and anti-H. pylori serology with culture of 75 %.

This autoimmune disorder is localised to the body of the stomach, where parietal cells are located.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Ghrelin is a 28 {{amino acid}} peptide {{secreted}} mainly by endocrine cells {{present in the}} gastric mucosa and acknowledged as an endogenous releaser of growth hormone. The immunohistochemical expression of ghrelin has been described in neuroendocrine tumors, and {{it is believed that}} may exert modulating action related to the growth of these tumors. OBJECTIVE: To study the presence of ghrelin and preproghrelin immunoreactive cells in gastric neuroendocrine tumors associated with <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis.</b> METHODS: Endoscopic biopsies from 15 patients with neuroendocrine tumor of the gastric mucosa associated with <b>atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> were performed for immunohistochemistry, and specific chromogranin, ghrelin and preproghrelin antibodies were applied. The immunohistochemical expression was assessed in tumor cells and endocrine micronodular hyperplasia present in mucosa adjacent to the tumor, and it was classified in relation to the number of stained cells. RESULTS: Chromogranin was positive in 14 out of 15 tumors. Ghrelin and preproghrelin immunoreactive cells were detected in 11 (73 %) and 13 (87 %) tumors, respectively. There was a significant correlation between the immunohistochemical results of both antigen expressions (kappa = 81 %). Ghrelin and preproghrelin expression was detected in hyperplastic nodules present in the mucosa adjacent to the tumor in seven and eight cases, respectively. There was no correlation between these results and those observed in neoplastic cells. CONCLUSION: Ghrelin and preproghrelin immunoreactive cells may be found in variable number in Type I neuroendocrine gastric tumors and in hyperplastic nodules associated with these tumors.

40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} {{the association of}} Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) CagA+ infection and pro-inflammatory polymorphisms of the genes interleukin (IL) - 1 RN and IL- 1 B with the risk of gastric atrophy and peptic ulcers in a dyspeptic population in Costa Rica, a country with high incidence and mortality of gastric cancer. METHODS: Seven biopsy specimens, a fasting blood sample and a questionnaire concerning nutritional and sociodemographic factors were obtained from 501 consecutive patients who had undergone endoscopy for dyspeptic symptoms. A histopathological diagnosis was made. Pepsinogen concentrations were analyzed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Infection with H pylori CagA+ was determined by serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). IL- 1 B and IL- 1 RN polymorphisms genotyping was performed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and PCR respectively. RESULTS: In this dyspeptic population, 86 % were H pylori positive and of these, 67. 8 % were positive for CagA. <b>Atrophic</b> antral <b>gastritis</b> (AAG) was associated with CagA+ status [odd ratio (OR) = 4. 1; P < 0. 000] and fruit consumption (OR = 0. 3; P < 0. 00). <b>Atrophic</b> body <b>gastritis</b> (ABG) was associated with pepsinogen PGI/PGII < 3. 4 (OR = 4. 9; P < 0. 04) and alcohol consumption (OR = 7. 3; P < 0. 02). Duodenal ulcer was associated with CagA+ (OR = 2. 9; P < 0. 04) and smoking (OR = 2. 4; P < 0. 04). PGI < 60 μg/L as well as PGI/PGII < 3. 4 were associated with CagA+. CONCLUSION: In a dyspeptic population in Costa Rica, H pylori CagA+ is not associated with ABG, {{but it is a}} risk factor for AAG.
