5|$|Although it is a mimid, {{the black}} catbird {{is not known}} to imitate any other species. Its song {{is a mix of}} harsh notes and clear flute-like whistles, with the phrases repeated. It builds a cup nest in low bushes or trees, and lays two bluish eggs. It is {{threatened}} by habitat loss, and has been assessed <b>as</b> <b>near</b> threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.|$|E
5|$|Because of its slow {{reproductive}} rate, the {{dusky shark}} is very vulnerable to human-caused population depletion. This species is highly valued by commercial fisheries for its fins, used in shark fin soup, {{and for its}} meat, skin, and liver oil. It is also esteemed by recreational fishers. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species <b>as</b> <b>Near</b> Threatened worldwide and Vulnerable off the eastern United States, where populations have dropped to 1520% of 1970s levels. The dusky shark is regarded as potentially dangerous to humans due to its large size, but there are few attacks attributable to it.|$|E
5|$|Benthic in nature, {{the plain}} maskray feeds mainly on caridean shrimp and polychaete worms, {{and to a}} lesser extent on small bony fishes. It is viviparous, with females {{producing}} litters of one or two young that are nourished during gestation via histotroph ("uterine milk"). This species lacks economic value but is caught incidentally in bottom trawls, which it is thought to be less able to withstand than other maskrays due to its gracile build. As it also has a limited distribution and low fecundity, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it <b>as</b> <b>Near</b> Threatened.|$|E

5|$|Common and gregarious, the hardnose shark is a {{predator}} of bony fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans. This species is viviparous, {{with the growing}} embryos sustained to term via a placental connection to their mother. Females have a biennial reproductive cycle and bear litters {{of one or two}} pups after a twelve-month gestation period. The hardnose shark is fished for meat throughout its range and, given its low reproductive rate, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it <b>as</b> <b>Near</b> Threatened.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies can {{bioaccumulate}} heavy metals, including toxic ones, from polluted soil.

5|$|In all {{versions}} of the tale, after marrying Gautama, Ahalya settles into his ashram (hermitage), which generally becomes the site of her epic curse. The Ramayana records that Gautama's ashram is in a forest (Mithila-upavana) near Mithila, where the couple practices asceticism together for several years. In other scriptures, the ashram is usually near the river bank. The Brahma Purana {{says that it is}} near the river Godavari and the Skanda Purana (701–1200 CE) places it near the river Narmada. The Padma Purana and the Brahma Vaivarta Purana (801–1100 CE) describe the ashram <b>as</b> <b>near</b> the holy city of Pushkar.|$|E

5|$|Interactions with divers {{show that}} the prickly shark behaves inoffensively towards humans, either tolerating contact or fleeing when closely approached. It is {{susceptible}} to incidental capture by commercial bottom trawls, gillnets, or line gear. It has little commercial value since the meat is soft and poorly regarded. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the prickly shark <b>as</b> <b>Near</b> Threatened, citing its patchy known distribution and the continuing expansion of deepwater fisheries.|$|E

5|$|Normally wary of humans, blacktip sharks {{can become}} {{aggressive}} {{in the presence}} of food and have been responsible for a number of attacks on people. This species is of importance to both commercial and recreational fisheries across many parts of its range, with its meat, skin, fins, and liver oil used. It has been assessed <b>as</b> <b>Near</b> Threatened by the IUCN, {{on the basis of its}} low reproductive rate and high value to fishers.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the bluespotted ribbontail ray <b>as</b> <b>Near</b> Threatened. Although still relatively common and widely distributed, this species faces continuing degradation of its coral reef habitat throughout its range, from development and destructive fishing practices using cyanide or dynamite. In addition, its populations are under heavy pressure by artisanal and commercial fisheries, and by local collecting for the aquarium trade.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the epaulette shark as of Least Concern. This species {{is common in}} Australian waters, where it is not captured by either commercial or recreational fisheries, and is minimally affected by collection for the aquarium trade and fishery bycatch. Much of its Australian habitat is encompassed by protected marine parks. Off New Guinea, the epaulette shark has been assessed <b>as</b> <b>Near</b> Threatened, as there it faces habitat degradation, destructive fishing practices, and over-exploitation by artisan fishers.|$|E

30|$|Mixed-effects {{models were}} {{analyzed}} {{to determine whether}} being near a fine or coarse event boundary reduced the overall amount of looking to the target object (a main effect of event boundary condition) or shifted when looks to the target object occurred (an interaction between event boundary condition and time relative to contact). (If the temporal window before object contact were sufficiently large, one would expect no effect for the earliest timepoints, before predictive looking is possible, with the effect building as time to contact approached.) Again, the effects package in R (Fox, 2003) was used to estimate fixed effects and confidence intervals. For Study 1, 4.1 % of the interest areas were classified <b>as</b> being <b>near</b> a coarse event boundary, 41.1 % were classified <b>as</b> being <b>near</b> a fine event boundary, and 15.2 % were classified <b>as</b> being <b>near</b> both a coarse and a fine boundary. For Study 2, 5.5 % were classified <b>as</b> being <b>near</b> a coarse event boundary, 34.8 % were classified <b>as</b> being <b>near</b> a fine event boundary, and 17.6 % were classified <b>as</b> being <b>near</b> both a coarse and a fine boundary. Follow-up analyses were also conducted to control for {{the size of the}} interest area drawn around each contacted object {{in order to ensure that}} interest area size did not drive the event boundary effects.|$|R
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} this species <b>as</b> <b>Near</b> Threatened worldwide and Vulnerable {{in the northwestern}} Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. The American Fisheries Society has also assessed North American dusky shark populations as Vulnerable. Its very low reproductive rate renders the dusky shark extremely susceptible to overfishing.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} pyjama shark <b>as</b> <b>Near</b> Threatened, citing its small {{distribution}} {{and a recent}} increase in fishing pressure on small sharks in the region. However, {{there is no evidence}} to suggest that its population has declined. There are no specific conservation measures in place for this species, though its range encompasses two marine reserves. The South African Sea Fisheries Research Institute is considering legally decommercializing the pyjama shark, which would limit the degree to which it can be targeted by commercial fisheries.|$|E
5|$|The Peruvian pelican {{is listed}} <b>as</b> <b>Near</b> Threatened because, {{although}} {{the population is}} estimated by BirdLife International to exceed 500,000 mature individuals, and is possibly increasing, it has been much higher in the past. It declined dramatically during the 1998 El Niño event and could experience similar declines in the future. Conservation needs include regular monitoring throughout the range to determine population trends, particularly after El Niño years; restricting human access to important breeding colonies; and assessing interactions with fisheries.|$|E
