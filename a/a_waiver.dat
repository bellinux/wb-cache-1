5|$|The Court {{held that}} {{unless and until}} the suspect {{actually}} stated that he was relying on that right, his subsequent voluntary statements {{could be used in}} court and police could continue to interact with (or question) him. The mere act of remaining silent was, on its own, insufficient to imply the suspect has invoked his or her rights. Furthermore, a voluntary reply even after lengthy silence could be construed as implying <b>a</b> <b>waiver.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because White did {{not officially}} depart Minnesota {{until the middle}} of his second semester, he was academically ineligible to receive a {{scholarship}} from any Division I school in 2010. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) usually requires a two semester residency for transfers. He transferred to Iowa State prior to using any of his athletic eligibility at Minnesota and applied to the NCAA for <b>a</b> <b>waiver</b> to be eligible to play during the 2010–11 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, but the NCAA denied his waiver. Iowa State appealed the decision, but their appeal was denied.|$|E

5|$|On March 6, 2014, the FCC {{announced}} that it would hold a vote on March 31 on a proposal to ban joint sales agreements involving television stations outright, making them attributable to FCC ownership limits if the senior partner sells 15% or more of advertising time of a competing junior partner station in the JSA; the ban applies to both existing sharing agreements under such a structure as well as pending station transactions that include a JSA. Station owners would be given a two-year grace period to unwind or modify joint sales agreements in violation of the policy; coordinated retransmission consent negotiations between two of the four highest-rated stations in a single market would also be barred under the proposal. Wheeler also proposed an expedited process to review joint sales agreements on a case-by-case basis, granting <b>a</b> <b>waiver</b> of the rules if a broadcaster can prove a particular joint sales agreement arrangement serves the public interest.|$|E
5|$|With Virginia Tech earning an {{automatic}} bid to the Orange Bowl, the Chick-fil-A Bowl {{had the first}} pick of the remaining ACC teams. Boston College, {{by virtue of its}} loss in the ACC Championship Game, was the highest remaining team, but Chick-fil-A Bowl representatives instead chose to invite Clemson, which had finished behind Boston College in the Atlantic Division standings. In making their decision, Chick-fil-A Bowl representatives cited Boston College's poor attendance at the ACC Championship Game in Jacksonville. The Gator Bowl, which is also held in Jacksonville, was reluctant to choose a team that had participated in the ACC Championship Game out of feat that the team's fans would be unwilling to return to Jacksonville so quickly. The Gator Bowl Association requested and received <b>a</b> <b>waiver</b> from the league's strict bowl selection rules and selected Virginia over Boston College.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{absorption}} of Virginia Tech and Miami into the ACC, questions arose about how an 11-team league could fairly select participants in the conference championship game. A divisional structure involving two six-team divisions competing for two championship-game slots would not be possible. In addition, the ACC could not continue to select its champion via round-robin play since there were now 11 teams and only seven or eight conference games available per team. Even the NCAA's addition of a 12th game to the regular season did little to relieve the conference's problem. Prior to the 2004college football season, the ACC requested <b>a</b> <b>waiver</b> to the NCAA's rule requiring conferences to have 12-plus teams before having a conference championship game. Before the season began, however, the NCAA rejected the ACC's application, and the league had to use a semi-round-robin format to select a champion during the 2004 football season. After that season, the inclusion of Boston College as the ACC's 12th team solved the problem of enabling the ACC to have a championship football game.|$|E
50|$|After the 2015-16 season, West {{was granted}} a sixth year of {{eligibility}} by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). In August 2016, he sustained a second serious knee injury, which caused him to miss the entire season. Northwestern State is planning on applying for <b>a</b> seventh-year <b>waiver</b> for West. On May 5, 2017, he was approved of getting <b>a</b> 7th-year <b>waiver,</b> <b>a</b> rare feat that was only accomplished three other times in the NCAA before that point.|$|R

25|$|Residents of Massachusetts {{must have}} health {{insurance}} coverage under Chapter 58. Residents must indicate on their tax forms if they had insurance on December 31 of that tax year, had <b>a</b> <b>waiver</b> for religious reasons, or had <b>a</b> <b>waiver</b> from the Connector. The Connector waiver can be obtained if the resident demonstrates {{that there is no}} available coverage that is defined by the Connector as affordable. In March 2007, the Connector adopted an affordability schedule that allows residents to seek <b>a</b> <b>waiver.</b> If a resident does not have coverage and does not have <b>a</b> <b>waiver,</b> the Department of Revenue will enforce the insurance requirement by imposing a penalty. In 2007, the penalty was the loss of the personal exemption. Beginning in 2008, the penalty is half the cost of the lowest available yearly premium which will be enforced as an assessed addition to the individual's income tax.|$|E
