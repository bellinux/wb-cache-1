5|$|Culturally the Antankarana {{have many}} {{similarities}} with the neighboring Sakalava. They practice tromba (ancestral spirit possession) {{and believe in}} nature spirits. They adhere {{to a wide range}} of fady (ancestral taboos), particularly including several that serve to protect wildlife <b>and</b> <b>wilderness</b> areas. The traditional economy of the Antankarana revolved around fishing and livestock, although more recently they have adopted farming; many are salary earners working in civil administration, teaching, trade and other areas.|$|E
5|$|Gossett was a Marine Corps, Army, and Army Air Force {{veteran who}} saw action in Korea and Vietnam. His {{military}} experience included advanced jump training <b>and</b> <b>wilderness</b> survival. After retiring from military service in 1973, {{he worked as}} an ROTC instructor, taught military law at Weber State University in Ogden, Utah, and hosted {{a radio talk show}} in Salt Lake City which featured discussions about the paranormal. He died in 2003.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, the public, through newspapers, {{followed}} Baden-Powell's {{struggle to}} hold Mafeking, {{and when the}} siege was broken, {{he had become a}} national hero. This rise to fame fuelled the sales of the small instruction book he had written in 1899 about military scouting <b>and</b> <b>wilderness</b> survival, Aids to Scouting, that owed much to what he had learned from discussions with Burnham.|$|E

5|$|Mountain {{climbing}} on Mount Rainier is difficult, involving traversing the largest glaciers in the U.S. south of Alaska. Most climbers require {{two to three}} days to reach the summit, with a success rate of approximately 50%. Climbing teams require experience in glacier travel, self-rescue, <b>and</b> <b>wilderness</b> travel. About 8,000 to 13,000people attempt the climb each year, about 90% via routes from Camp Muir on the southeast flank.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being set}} in space, the film uses motifs from {{shipwreck}} <b>and</b> <b>wilderness</b> survival stories about psychological change and resilience {{in the aftermath}} of a catastrophe. Cuarón uses the character, Stone, to illustrate clarity of mind, persistence, training, and improvisation in the face of isolation and the consequences of a relentless Murphy's law. The film incorporates spiritual or existential themes, in the facts of Stone's daughter's accidental and meaningless death, and in the necessity of summoning the will to survive in the face of overwhelming odds, without future certainties, and with the impossibility of rescue from personal dissolution without finding this willpower. Calamities occur but only the surviving astronauts see them.|$|E
5|$|His {{social and}} {{political}} activities resulted in a diminished literary output. He wrote a new historical novel, Na polu chwały (On the Field of Glory), that was meant {{as the beginning of}} a new trilogy; it was, however, criticized as being a lesser version of his original Trilogy, and was never continued. Similarly, his contemporary novel Wiry Whirlpool (novel), 1910, which sought to criticize some of Sienkiewicz's political opponents, received a mostly polemical and politicized response. His 1910 novel for young people, W pustyni i w puszczy (In Desert <b>and</b> <b>Wilderness),</b> serialized in Kurier Warszawski (The Warsaw Courier), finishing in 1911, was much better received and became widely popular among children and young adults.|$|E

5|$|In 1978, {{expansion}} of Sunshine Village ski resort was approved, with added parking, hotel expansion, {{and development of}} Goat's Eye Mountain. Implementation of this development proposal was delayed through the 1980s, while environmental assessments were conducted. In 1989, Sunshine Village withdrew its development proposal, in light of government reservations, and submitted a revised proposal in 1992. This plan {{was approved by the}} government, pending environmental review. Subsequently, the Canadian Parks <b>and</b> <b>Wilderness</b> Society (CPAWS) filed a court injunction, which halted the development. CPAWS also put pressure on UNESCO to revoke Banff's World Heritage Site status, over concerns that developments were harming the park's ecological health.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{returned}} to the East Coast in late September 1931. Although he was writing Arctic Village, he also wrote prolifically on other topics and published several articles about American forestry. In particular, he was concerned that few articles of this time {{addressed the issue of}} deforestation, and he {{wrote a letter to the}} president of the American Forestry Association, George D. Pratt, on the matter. He also pursued a variety of other activities: he accepted an invitation to serve on a committee to dedicate a memorial (Louis Marshall Memorial Hall) to his father at the forestry college in Syracuse. He lectured in various cities, delivering speeches about his travels <b>and</b> <b>wilderness</b> preservation.|$|E
5|$|NY373 exists entirely {{within the}} {{boundaries}} of Adirondack Park, a protected area maintained by the State of New York. Adirondack Park was created in the 1880s after concerns arose about logging trees in the area. The logging was a substantial part of New York's economy, but protests were lodged by The New York Times and others against the clearing of entire mountains <b>and</b> <b>wilderness</b> areas of trees. Public opinion turned firmly against the loggers by the 1880s, and the park was created in 1885. It was the first State Forest Preserve in America. The park was further protected in 1894 when a clause was added to the New York State constitution which banned the selling of timber from state parks.|$|E

5|$|In Maui County, the Hawai'i Department of Education ordered for {{the closure}} of all schools and the {{designation}} of some facilities as emergency shelters. All public schools in Hawaii County were also closed by the department. Both the University of Hawaii and the Hawaii Community College closed their campuses during Iselle's passage. The Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources closed all of its managed lands in Hawaii and Maui counties and closed some of its campgrounds <b>and</b> <b>wilderness</b> areas in Oahu and Kauai counties. All state offices and courthouses in Hawaii County were closed with the retention of only essential staff. Although Hawaiian Airlines did not cancel its flights, the company waived fees for passengers seeking to change from flights expected to service during Iselle's passage. United Airlines and Island Air later took the same accommodative measures. The latter later cancelled all of its inter-Hawaiian flights on August7, {{with the exception of}} flights serving Kauai; American Airlines and numerous other airlines would follow suit as the threat of Iselle neared. The Salvation Army readied its resources in preparation for relief operations for Iselle in Hawaii.|$|E
