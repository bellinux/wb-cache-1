25|$|The Egyptians {{were one}} of the first major civilizations to codify design {{elements}} in art. The wall painting done {{in the service of the}} Pharaohs followed a rigid code of visual rules and meanings. Early Egyptian art is characterized by the absence of linear perspective, which results in a seemingly flat space. These artists tended to create images based on what they knew, and not as much on what they saw. Objects in these artworks generally do not decrease in size as they increase in distance and there is little shading to indicate depth. Sometimes, distance is indicated through the use of tiered space, where more distant objects are drawn higher above the nearby objects, but in the same scale and with no overlapping of forms. People and objects are almost always drawn in profile. <b>Also,</b> <b>you</b> may notice the people in Egyptian art are never facing forward. Archaeologists are not yet sure of why, but they are leaning towards the fact that artists status was low in the hierarchy so they could never be in front of a higher authority figure, and never be faced towards them.|$|E

She commended the level design for distinguishing each level in terms of providing unique gameplay mechanics and expressed admiration for the game world's [...] "gorgeous, painterly aesthetic". Phil Savage, writing for PC Gamer, stated that [...] "At its worst, it offers a similar experience to its predecessor, which is to say, it offers tens of hours of extraordinary first-person stealth and action". PC Gamer later recognized the Clockwork Mansion {{as one of the best}} levels of 2016. Polygons Arthur Gies noted the combat system as [...] "improved and refined", the setting as [...] "Dishonored 2s greatest inherited strength" [...] and the AI units for their [...] "excellent peripheral vision", yet regarded the inability to replay missions and the absence of a New Game Plus option as [...] "possible deal-breakers". Alice Bell at VideoGamer.com wrote in her verdict, [...] "Dishonored 2 takes everything you loved about Dishonored and improves upon it without becoming bloated.

Lee said it was almost a relief that Moody left because of tensions created within the band.

I didn't want to fit any mold. I wanted it to be something that couldn't be replicated by anyone else. It was important to me that the album began with [...] "Cannonball" [...] and ended with [...] "If You Say So". I have to acknowledge what I've been through this year.

2500|$|Believed to {{have been}} written in the 1390s, Chaucer's short poem Fortune, is also {{inferred}} to directly reference Lancaster. [...] "Chaucer as narrator" [...] openly defies Fortune, proclaiming he has learned who his enemies are through her tyranny and deceit, and declares [...] "my suffisaunce" [...] (15) and that [...] "over himself hath the maystrye" [...] (14). [...] Fortune, in turn, does not understand Chaucer's harsh words to her for she believes she has been kind to him, claims {{that he does not}} know what she has in store for him in the future, but most importantly, [...] "And eek thou hast thy beste frend alyve" [...] (32, 40, 48). [...] Chaucer retorts that [...] "My frend maystow nat reven, blind goddesse" [...] (50) and orders her to take away those who merely pretend to be his friends. [...] Fortune turns her attention to three princes whom she implores to relieve Chaucer of his pain and [...] "Preyeth his beste frend of his noblesse/That to som beter estat he may atteyne" [...] (78–79). [...] The three princes are believed to represent the dukes of Lancaster, York, and Gloucester, and a portion of line 76, [...] "as three of you or tweyne," [...] to refer to the ordinance of 1390 which specified that no royal gift could be authorised without the consent of {{at least two of the}} three dukes. Most conspicuous in this short poem is the number of references to Chaucer's [...] "beste frend". [...] Fortune states three times in her response to the plaintiff, [...] "And <b>also,</b> <b>you</b> still have your best friend alive" [...] (32, 40, 48); she also references his [...] "beste frend" [...] in the envoy when appealing to his [...] "noblesse" [...] to help Chaucer to a higher estate. [...] A fifth reference is made by [...] "Chaucer as narrator" [...] who rails at Fortune that she shall not take his friend from him. [...] While the envoy playfully hints to Lancaster that Chaucer would certainly appreciate a boost to his status or income, the poem Fortune distinctively shows his deep appreciation and affection for John of Gaunt.|$|E
2500|$|In July, Feige {{discussed}} specific {{moments in}} the film, including an homage to The Amazing Spider-Man issue 33 where Parker is trapped underneath rubble, something Feige [...] "wanted {{to see in a}} movie for a long, long time". Daley said that they added the scene to the script because of how much Feige wanted it, and explained, [...] "We have [...] starting the scene with such self-doubt and helplessness, in a way that you really see the kid. You feel for him. He's screaming for help, because he doesn't think he can do it, and then ... he kind of realizes that that's been his biggest problem." [...] Feige compared the film's final scene, where Parker accidentally reveals that he is Spider-Man to his Aunt May, to the ending of Iron Man when Stark reveals that he is Iron Man to the world, saying, [...] "what does that mean for the next movie? I don't know, but it will force us to do something unique." [...] Goldstein added that it [...] "diminishes what is often the most trivial part of superhero worlds, which is finding your secret. It takes the emphasis off that [...] lets her become part of what's really his life". Feige also talked about the film's revelation that the Vulture is the father of Parker's love interest, saying, [...] "If that didn't work, the movie didn't work. We worked backwards and forwards from that moment. It was like two movies—it was the movie up until then and the movie after that moment. Because it had to surprise you, but it had to be true, <b>also.</b> <b>You</b> had to believe that we had set it up so that you would buy it [...] doesn't seem like something out of left field. That's a pretty great moment and we didn't know until we showed it to audiences" [...] that it would work. Watts said the revelation scene and the following interactions between the Vulture and Parker were, [...] "more than anything else, [...] I was looking forward to, and I got {{to have a lot of}} fun shooting that stuff." [...] Goldstein said the scene after the reveal, where Vulture realizes that Parker is Spider-Man while driving him to the school dance, was the moment he was most proud of in the film, and Daley said that scene's effect on audiences was the dramatic equivalent of an audience laughing at a joke they had written. He added that the writers were [...] "giddy when we first came up with , because it's taking the obvious tension of meeting the father of the girl that you have a crush on, and multiplying it by 1,000, when you also realize he's the guy you've been trying to stop the whole time." ...|$|E
