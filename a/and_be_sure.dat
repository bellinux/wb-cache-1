2500|$|In September 2007, Davis free-soloed Pervertical Sanctuary (5.11a), {{which was}} her goal, a {{difficult}} route {{at the east}} face of Longs Peak (...) , a thousand-foot granite wall known as [...] "The Diamond" [...] in Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado. She repeated the feat on 13 September with Peter Mortimer filming. Famous among climbers, Ryan Minton explains in his article about Davis' achievement that [...] "The Diamond {{is one of the}} most revered alpine walls in North America" [...] and all of the climbing routes on it are extremely difficult. To be fully prepared <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> she was not bothered by other climbers, Davis slept close to the peak itself on 3 September and began climbing at 4:15am. Interviewed after the climb, Davis said that positive thinking was central to her success as well as knowing that she was carrying very little gear and the conception of herself as a crack climber. Davis is the first woman to free solo the Diamond and the second person to free solo the Pervertical Sanctuary route (the other is Derek Hersey).|$|E
