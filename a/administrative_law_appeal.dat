40|$|Dutch litigants in <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> cases <b>appeal</b> {{quite often}} – appeal rates are {{significantly}} higher than in most civil law cases and criminal law cases. This research aims to explain this by analysing which factors influence the decision to appeal for review. Why does one citizen appeal a negative judgment by the court of first instance, while another chooses to end the conflict? Do citizens make this choice in a ‘rational’ fashion, weighing costs and benefits, or does this choice depend on normative considerations? In order to answer these questions, a survey was held among more than 300 citizens who had recently received a court judgment in an <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> case. From the results, it follows that citizens who choose not to appeal do so mainly for financial reasons. Those who do appeal, on the other hand, do so primarily because they are dissatisfied with the grounds stated in the judgment. Financial reasons do not play an important part for these litigants, who mainly want the court of appeal to finally do justice to them. Moreover, the findings show that {{the conduct of the}} judge at the court session significantly influences the acceptance of the judgment. If citizens are satisfied with {{the manner in which the}} judge conducted the proceedings, they are less likely to appeal. In addition, citizens who are represented by a lawyer are more likely to appeal for review. This is remarkable, as legal representation does not improve citizens’ chances of success at the court of appeal...|$|R

40|$|Few {{doubt the}} {{tremendous}} impact the modern national administrative state {{has had on}} our federal system. Yet the relationship between federalism and <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> remains strangely inchoate and unanalyzed. Although <b>administrative</b> <b>law’s</b> constitutional dimensions are generally recognized to have significant federalism implications, more run-of-the-mill <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> concerns are rarely approached through a federalism lens. Recent Supreme Court case law suggests that the blinders to the relationship of federalism and <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> may be lifting. In a number of highly contentious recent decisions, the Court has refused curb Congress’s regulatory authority on constitutional grounds, but nonetheless indicated that federalism concerns with protecting the states’ independent regulatory role nonetheless retain traction. The {{means by which the}} Court appears to be addressing such concerns, however, is <b>administrative</b> <b>law.</b> As a result, <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> may be becoming the new federalism. This article aims to explore how the Court may be employing <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> as a surrogate for constitutional federalism and to assess how well <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> performs this surrogacy role. I conclude that <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> has important federalism-reinforcing features, but that the Court’s decisions to date have failed to fully develop <b>administrative</b> <b>law’s</b> federalism potential. I also argue that the best approach—not only for the functioning of federal agencies but, critically, for the continued vibrancy of federalism {{in the world of the}} modern federal administrative state—is for the Court (and Congress and the President) to advance federalism within the overall rubric of <b>administrative</b> <b>law,</b> rather than to treat federalism as a more absolute restriction on agency action absent express congressional authorization. The article consists of four parts. Part I contains an analysis of recent Supreme Court precedent, focusing in particular on five decisions addressing the intersection of federalism and <b>administrative</b> <b>law.</b> Part II advances the claim that <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> may be becoming the new federalism. Here I contend that the Court is unwilling to curb Congress on federalism grounds and that federalism concerns instead are being incorporated into <b>administrative</b> <b>law.</b> I then examine two ways in which federalism concerns are being addressed through an <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> framework: application of ordinary <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> to the benefit of the states and development of more extraordinary federalism-inspired <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> analyses. I also discuss the current administrative preemption debate, which I contend approaches the relationship between federalism and <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> in overly narrow terms, emphasizing the conflict between federalism and <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> rather than their potential synergies. Part III switches to a more normative and theoretical perspective. I begin with an analysis of whether using <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> as a surrogate for federalism concerns is a legitimate judicial undertaking. I conclude that it is, and underscore the benefits of the <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> approach over other subconstitutional federalism doctrines. I then examine whether, even if legitimate, using <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> as a surrogate for federalism concerns is likely to prove effective. In addition to rejecting claims that administrative agencies are categorically ill-suited to protecting state regulatory autonomy, I emphasize the need to distinguish between agencies and <b>administrative</b> <b>law.</b> In that vein, I argue that three features of <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> reinforce its federalism potential: its procedural mechanisms, in particular notice-and-comment rulemaking; its doctrinal and institutional capaciousness; and its very status as subconstitutional law. Part IV assesses the implications of this analysis of <b>administrative</b> <b>law’s</b> federalism potential. One implication is that the Court should employ <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> with an eye to reinforcing agencies’ sensitivity and responsiveness to state interests. A second is that federalism concerns raised by federal agency action may be best advanced through ordinary <b>administrative</b> <b>law,</b> albeit with express recognition of how state interests factor into judicial review. Although the Court’s recent decisions make some helpful steps in this direction, their lack of clarity and reflection on how federalism concerns should factor into application of <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> limit their generative potential...|$|R

40|$|The {{advent of}} {{globalization}} poses {{challenges to the}} theory of <b>administrative</b> <b>law.</b> These challenges consist in the growing disconnect between <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> and the nation-state and the continuously close interaction, and at times fusion, of domestic and international <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> and action, but also in the incremental dissolution of the public-private divide, the contribution of private actors to public governance, and the migration of <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> ideas across legal orders. <b>Administrative</b> <b>law</b> is thereby placed in a transnational legal space and becomes subject to transnational legal processes. This also has repercussions for the theory of <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> if the goal of such a theory is to provide an overarching framework for thinking about <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> whenever and wherever administrative action occurs, including in times of increasing detachment of <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> from domestic legal sources and domestic public institutions.

40|$|The {{project of}} global <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> has {{stood out from}} various efforts to tame global {{governance}} with the rule of law. By enhancing transparency and accountability, global <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> is expected to improve the policy output of global administration, giving legitimacy to global governance. In this way, global <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> evolves into a small-c global constitutionalism. In this paper, I trace the trajectory of global <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> as small-c global constitutionalism and how the concept of legitimacy is recast in relation to global governance.

40|$|<b>Administrative</b> <b>law</b> and {{constitutional}} law, which together constitute {{what we call}} "public law," are closely related in many ways. For one thing, constitutional law refers {{to the body of}} the law that sets out the powers of public authorities by establishing the political system and stipulates the relationship between individuals and public authorities, while <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> concerns "the ways in which the exercise of public power may be held to constitutional account.

The former centers on the distinction between law and non-law; the latter {{is concerned with the}} legitimacy of global <b>administrative</b> <b>law.</b> Benedict Kingsbury’s The Concept of ‘Law’ in Global <b>Administrative</b> <b>Law</b> attempts to answer this twofold challenge by centering the new paradigm of international law, as epitomized by global <b>administrative</b> <b>law,</b> on the notion of publicness.
