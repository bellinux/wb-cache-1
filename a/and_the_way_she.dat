In the lyrics, she sings to a lover [...] "Touch me and I come alive / I can feel you on my lips / I can feel you deep inside". Kara DioGuardi said she was inspired by the relationship between Spears and her first son in the studio, saying: [...] "I would look at the two of them, the way {{they looked at each other}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> would hold the baby.

2500|$|The {{historically}} accepted {{standard version}} of the speech was written by Gage, {{but there are no}} reports of Gage working with Truth on the transcription. Gage portrays Truth as using a Southern dialect, which the earliest reports of the speech do not mention. Truth is said to have prided herself on her spoken English. The dialect in Gage's 1863 version is less severe than in her later {{version of the}} speech that she published in 1881. The rearticulation in the different published versions of Gage's writings serve as the metonymic transfiguration of Truth. In addition, the crowd Truth addressed that day consisted of mainly white, privileged women. [...] In Gage's recollection, she describes that the crowd did not want Truth to speak because they did not want people to confuse the cause of suffrage with abolition, despite many reports that Truth was welcomed with respect. Although Gage's version provides further context, it is written as a narrative: she adds her own commentary, creating an entire scene of the event, including the audience reactions. Because Gage's version is built primarily on her interpretation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> chose to portray it, it cannot be considered a pure representation of the event.|$|E

[...] He also praised Michelle Ruff's voice acting in the English dub. Anime News Network's Rebecca Silverman also praised Sinon's portrayal, noting her to be [...] "a much more interesting character" [...] than both Kirito or Asuna, as [...] "what makes Sinon a more successful character than any to previously appear in the main series is that she has more depth. Rather than being just a scared or traumatized character, she's someone who is actively working to change herself [...] it feels like this is a turning point for Kawahara's writing skill. Sinon isn't perfectly depicted, but she's got more going on than previous characters." [...] Sam of The Otaku's Study similarly noted how Sinon already established herself as [...] "one of the most developed Sword Art Online characters" [...] despite appearing in only 7 episodes thus far, praising her backstory and contrast between her in-game and out-of-game personas.|$|E
