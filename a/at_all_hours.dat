5|$|In August 1996, Radiohead toured as {{the opening}} act for Alanis Morissette. They resumed {{recording}} {{not at a}} studio but at St. Catherine's Court, a 15th-century mansion near Bath. The sessions were relaxed, with the band playing <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>hours</b> of the day, recording in different rooms, {{and listening to the}} Beatles, DJ Shadow, Ennio Morricone and Miles Davis for inspiration.|$|E
5|$|Marguerite Louise's caprices lead to sour {{relations}} with the family. She argued with the Grand Duchess Vittoria over precedence, and with Grand Duke Ferdinando over her spending. Her spending habits not only spelled conflict with the Grand Duke, but made her unpopular with the Florentines. This was compounded by her unseemly conduct, such as the two grooms who frequented her chamber <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>hours.</b>|$|E
5|$|The section {{immediately}} {{south of}} Highway401 is often congested <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>hours.</b> Traffic studies have attributed congestion in the southbound lanes {{to the number}} of lanes merging from Highways401 and404 into the parkway and the lane changing that results from merging traffic from Highway401 clashing with exiting traffic to the nearby York Mills exit. Congestion in the northbound lanes is attributed to truck traffic coping with the steep grade of the valley, lane changing, and insufficient advanced signage for Highway401. Most traffic in this section travels north on Highway404, but only two of the five lanes lead to it.|$|E

5|$|While Russia {{is one of}} {{the highest}} {{consumers}} of alcohol per capita in the world, the use of non-traditional surrogate alcohols rapidly rose in the 2010s due to ongoing economic difficulties in Russia. With a price far below that of government-regulated vodka, surrogates reached an estimated height of twenty percent of the country's alcohol consumption by 2016. These products were often nearly pure alcohol that could be diluted to a rough approximation of vodka, and were frequently available <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>hours</b> via strategically placed vending machines. In the Irkutsk incident, the victims drank scented bath lotion that was mislabeled as containing drinkable ethanol.|$|E
5|$|With a more {{streamlined}} form {{than other}} nurse sharks, the {{tawny nurse shark}} {{is believed to be}} a less benthic, more active swimmer. The characteristics of its body, head, fins, and teeth are comparable to other active reef sharks sharing its range, such as the sicklefin lemon shark (Negaprion acutidens). Tawny nurse sharks are primarily nocturnal, though they are said to be active <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>hours</b> off Madagascar, and in captivity they will become diurnally active if presented with food. During the day, groups of two dozen or more sharks can be found resting inside caves and under ledges, often stacked atop one another. Individual sharks have small home ranges that they consistently return to each day.|$|E
25|$|Wildcats {{are mainly}} crepuscular or nocturnal, {{though they may}} hunt <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>hours</b> during the winter when food is scarce.|$|E
60|$|As the day wore on, however, {{it became}} {{gradually}} {{clear to him}} that Montague Nevitt didn't mean to return <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>Hour</b> after hour passed by, but nothing was heard of him. The landlord, good man, began to express his doubts and fears most freely. He hoped no harm hadn't come to the gentleman in the parlour; he had a powerful zight o' money on un {{for a man to}} carry about; the landlord had zeen it when he took out his book from his pocket to pay the porter. Volks didn't ought to go about with two or dree hundred pound or more in the lonely lanes {{on the edge of the}} moorland.|$|R

All this makes it clear that Father Newman does not give enough attention to details.|$|E
25|$|During a {{break from}} his studies at Dresden University, Carlo, the elder and {{favourite}} son of Count Massimiliano Moor has fallen amongst thieves, literally.

25|$|Duties at {{the main}} camp were light, mainly {{consisting}} of experimenting with new iron pontoons, and assisting at the Ismaïlia Canal Works. The two detachments {{on the other hand}} were used to operate the small vessels crossing the Canal <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>hours</b> of the day and night, and also forming and breaking the pontoon bridges several times each day.|$|E
50|$|Harper’s Garage {{agreed to}} accept all petrol for its two {{stations}} from Esso {{for a long}} period of time, a solus agreement. It agreed to keep the garage open <b>at</b> <b>all</b> reasonable <b>hours</b> and not to sell it without ensuring that the buyer entered a similar agreement. One agreement was for 5 years, the other for 21 years.|$|R

25|$|Auckland has two {{commercial}} harbours (not counting ferry terminals), with {{an international}} container port in Auckland and a regional port in Onehunga. There is also an associated 'inland port' (reshipment terminals without direct maritime access) serving the national reshipment trade, located in Wiri, South Auckland. In its facilities, the company employs the equivalent of 550 full-time staff and is in operation <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>hours</b> to allow for quick turnaround of cargo.|$|E
25|$|Since October 2015, McDonald's offers breakfast {{all day in}} Australia, Canada, Mexico (Tijuana, Baja California Norte only), New Zealand & USA. However, {{the full}} breakfast menu won’t be {{available}} <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>hours.</b> Only certain items, such as sausage burritos or hotcakes will be available beyond the usual 10:30 A.M. cutoff weekdays or 11 weekends.

25|$|A {{fleet of}} 40,000 black-and-yellow taxis ply the s <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>hours.</b> License {{controls}} are not enforced rigorously. There {{have been reports}} of organized crime controlling the access of taxis to the city airports and other major destinations. Taxi drivers are known for trying {{to take advantage of}} tourists. Radio-link companies provide reliable and safe service; many such companies provide incentives for frequent users. Low-fare limo services, known as remises, have become popular in recent years.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1970s, Christopher Street {{became the}} [...] "Main Street" [...] of gay New York. Large numbers {{of gay men}} would stroll its length <b>at</b> {{seemingly}} <b>all</b> <b>hours.</b> Gay bars and stores selling leather fetish clothing and artistic decorative items flourished at that time. This changed dramatically {{with the loss of}} many gay men during the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s. The apparent center of gay life subsequently shifted north of 14th Street to Chelsea.|$|R
50|$|Gebhard next married Marie L Gamble, {{an actress}} known as Marie Wilson, {{who had been}} a member of a sextette called the Florodora. The wedding was a secret affair carried out in 1907 by the Baptist {{minister}} Rev. Dr. Henry Marsh Warren, but the details leaked out months later. Warren was known as the “Hotel Parson” because he held services in hotel lobbies and was available <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>hour</b> to marry couples on demand. He was also the founder of the National Save a Life League, formed to prevent suicides. Although they parted, Marie returned to nurse Gebhard in his final illness. Following his death in 1910, Marie disputed his will that named his sister Isabelle as sole beneficiary. Marie claimed that a new will had been made before he died; she also claimed that the value of the estate was much higher than the figure declared in the probate.|$|R
40|$|Results are {{reported}} for observations of a quiet region {{at the center}} of the sun with an interferometer operating at a wavelength of 8. 33 mm and with an east-west baseline giving a maximum angular resolution of 28 arcsec. It is found that strong fluctuations occur over time scales of approximately 10 to 30 min and dominate the data at large hour angles, that smaller and more rapid fluctuations in both amplitude and phase are detected <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>hour</b> angles, and that the strong fluctuations are consistent with those that may be produced by the natural time variation of the fringe pattern during observation of a fixed source distribution. The weaker and more rapid fluctuations are tentatively attributed to antenna-tracking variations and the observation of features in a greatly extended source. The results are compared directly with those of two other interferometric studies of the quiet sun at millimeter wavelengths...|$|R
25|$|On 4 February, Tunny set her {{course for}} Swatow, keeping to the {{shoreline}} {{in hopes of}} intercepting shipping. En route, she passed a large hospital ship well marked and brilliantly lighted. On 6 February and 7 February, Tunny patrolled off Swatow. Numerous junks plying the Formosa and Swatow banks <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>hours</b> added to the hazards imposed by shallow water, and an inoperable fathometer (depthmeter) {{made it impossible for}} Tunny to approach the shore closer than six miles (10km).|$|E
25|$|In 1957, The Theater Cafe was {{converted}} to an ice skating rink, called Rainbo Arena, {{which was a}} practice rink for the Chicago Blackhawks including the year they won the 1961 Stanley Cup. The Rainbo Arena was also a training rink for several Olympic figure skaters, and {{during much of the}} 1960s was the only indoor hockey rink in the Chicago area open to the public. Several hockey leagues were headquartered at Rainbo, and particularly on weekends, hockey-playing groups would rent the ice <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>hours</b> of the day and night.|$|E
25|$|The American Prospect {{noted in}} 2008 that Onyango risked being persecuted and {{tortured}} in Kenya if she returned, {{and said that}} risk to her family members had increased, {{whether or not she}} was deported, because of her asylum case having been leaked and widely publicized internationally. They also noted that due to the heightened danger in Kenya, her asylum claim in the US was bolstered. After her case was revealed in international media, Onyango traveled to stay with unidentified friends in Cleveland, Ohio. She had felt threatened in Boston, as people called and knocking on her door <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>hours.</b> The Boston police said that there was a problem with curiosity seekers and paparazzi.|$|E
50|$|Bradmark put WNYQ {{on the air}} in November 1996 as the {{centerpiece}} of what would become a local radio empire that would soon acquire several other stations in the market. WNYQ assumed the adult contemporary format of WENU, branded under the Wink 105.7 name. From its launch, it aired local programming from 6:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. weekdays with satellite programming fed via Westwood One <b>at</b> <b>all</b> other <b>hours</b> as had its predecessor.|$|R

25|$|In 1941 life in China {{had become}} so {{dangerous}} because of Japanese aggression that the British government advised British nationals to leave. Florence (who was pregnant with Maureen) and the children left for Canada {{to stay with her}} family when Liddell accepted a position at a rural mission station in Xiaozhang, which served the poor. He joined his brother, Rob, who was a doctor there. The station was severely short of help and the missionaries there were exhausted. A constant stream of locals came <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>hours</b> for medical treatment. Liddell arrived at the station in time to relieve his brother, who was ill and needing to go on furlough. Liddell suffered many hardships himself at the mission.|$|E
25|$|In 1822, Ripley was {{a town of}} {{frequent}} street fights and shootouts where {{the most common type}} of business was a saloon. During the Rankins' first few months there, hecklers and protesters often followed the new preacher through town and gathered outside his cabin while their first permanent home was being built just yards from the river at 220 Front Street. When the local newspaper began publishing his letters to his brother on the topic of slavery (see next section), Rankin's reputation grew among both supporters and opponents of the anti-slavery movement. Slave owners and hunters often viewed him as their prime suspect and appeared at his door <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>hours</b> demanding information about fugitives. Soon, Rankin realized that the home was too accessible a place for him to properly raise his family.|$|E
25|$|Chinese {{students}} from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan live separately {{in their own}} dorms, as do foreigners. Mainlanders who are fluent in English or any foreign language may live in the foreigner- Hong Kong/Macau/Taiwan dorms, assuming they will be a roommate {{and participate in the}} foreign student activities, in order to help people get accustomed to mainland Chinese life. The quality of these dorms is usually better than that of mainland student dorms, with rooms either shared between only two people or completely private for a single student. Sexual decency attitudes are laxer than in mainlander dorms, with males and females sharing the same buildings and sometimes hallways (though not rooms). Students are allowed to bring visitors—including mainlanders—of the opposite sex to their rooms. Guests {{may or may not be}} allowed to stay overnight, depending on the rules of the dorm. Electricity is usually available <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>hours</b> of the day.|$|E

In the 1980s, national TV only aired Saturday mornings, not {{competing with the}} weekday and Sunday blocks of syndication aired by local independent stations but; however, by the 1990s, Fox and then WB started airing weekday afternoon blocks. By {{the end of the}} 1990s, both syndicated and national TV ended up losing most of its children's market to the rise of cable TV channels like Nickelodeon, Disney Channel and Cartoon Network which provided appealing children's entertainment throughout the week <b>at</b> nearly <b>all</b> <b>hours.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The rise {{of cable}} {{television}} networks such as the Disney Channel, Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network, which provided appealing animated entertainment throughout the week <b>at</b> nearly <b>all</b> <b>hours,</b> making Saturday morning timeslots far less important to viewers and advertisers. Cable channels have the additional advantage of being beyond FCC content regulations {{and do not have}} to abide by educational and advertising regulations; within a year of the E/I mandate being imposed, Nickelodeon shot ahead of all of the broadcast networks in Saturday morning viewership ratings. Currently, there are at least ten channels specializing in children's programming.|$|R
