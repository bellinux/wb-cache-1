Additionally, its outer bands brought moderate rainfall to parts of Oaxaca and Guerrero. Due to the high intensity and longevity of the hurricane, it significantly contributed to the record-high accumulated cyclone energy value for June 2010 in the eastern Pacific basin.|$|E

5|$|The {{airfield}} is very {{isolated in}} northwest Utah, {{sitting in the}} middle of a vast wasteland miles <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>any</b> major population center. It is probably for this reason, and the dry hot climate, that much of the airfield remains today. Still-extant facilities include the vast runway system, numerous ramps, taxiways, dispersal pads, and most of the original hangars (including the Enola Gay B-29 hangar). Most of the hospital complex and many barracks remain, as does a chow hall, chapel, swimming pool and many other World War II-era buildings.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{distance}} <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>any</b> major land masses, Carrie caused relatively minor damage along its path. On September16, the hurricane passed well north of Bermuda, causing minimal damage despite its intensity at the time, though hurricane reconnaissance flights {{in the area}} were postponed due to damage sustained {{by one of the}} aircraft. As it was transitioning to an extratropical cyclone southwest of the Azores, the German ship Pamir encountered the storm and capsized on September21, resulting in the deaths of 80crew members on board. As an extratropical storm, Carrie brought strong storm surge and heavy rain to the British Isles, which claimed three lives. The hurricane's long duration and path in open water also helped it attain a number of Atlantic hurricane records.|$|E
5|$|On May 16, {{the first}} {{tropical}} {{depression of the}} season formed to the southwest of Baja California, out of a tropical disturbance that had developed during May 5 within the vicinity of Panama. During May 16 the depression gradually developed, before early {{the next day the}} National Hurricane Centre declared it a tropical storm and named it Andres. The newly named tropical cyclone reached its peak intensity of 60mph (95km/h), later that day. After maintaining its peak intensity for 24 hours, Andres started to gradually weaken as upper level windshear over the system increased before it dissipated during May 20. Throughout its life as a tropical cyclone, Andres moved very little and slowly executed a cyclonic loop, while remaining well <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>any</b> land.|$|E

At night, several flocks coalesce and fly off into the rocky desert far <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>any</b> vegetation. Each bird scrapes itself a shallow sleeping hollow by moving from side to side. There are no jerboas or other small mammals in these barren wastes so foxes and jackals do not roam there at night and the birds are safe.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of Fraser's novels, Flashman goes from his {{expulsion}} from school into the army. Although he is a coward who tries to run <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>any</b> danger, he is involved in many famous military episodes from the 19th century, often taking actions that cause or affect subsequent events, such as his flatulence affecting the Charge of the Light Brigade, or being the person who probably shot George Armstrong Custer. When circumstances run against him and he is forced to fight, he often does so bravely and capably. Despite his cowardice and his attempts to flee, he becomes a decorated war hero and rises {{to the rank of}} brigadier-general. He also meets people who either were notable at the time—such as Benjamin Disraeli and the Duke of Wellington—or who became well-known after Flashman met them—such as Abraham Lincoln. Flashman either has, or tries to have, sex with most of the female characters: {{by the end of the}} ninth book he estimates that he has had sex with 480 women.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Nadine was {{the fourth}} longest-lived Atlantic {{hurricane}} on record. The fourteenth tropical cyclone and named storm of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, Nadine developed from a tropical wave west of Cape Verde on September10. By the following day, it had strengthened into Tropical Storm Nadine. After initially tracking northwestward, Nadine turned northward, well <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>any</b> landmass. Early on September15, Nadine reached hurricane status as it was curving eastward. Thereafter, an increase in vertical wind shear weakened Nadine back to a tropical storm by September16. On the following day, the storm began moving northeastward and threatened the Azores; by late on September19, however, Nadine veered east-southeastward before reaching the islands. Nonetheless, the storm produced tropical storm force winds on a few islands. On September21, the storm curved south-southeastward while located south of the Azores. Later that day, Nadine transitioned into a non-tropical low pressure area.|$|E

5|$|Roughly {{paralleling}} the North Carolina coast {{beginning on}} September26, Helene's slow movement and strong intensity resulted in moderate to heavy impacts in coastal {{areas of the}} state. Despite the hurricane's Category4 hurricane intensity, due to its closest approach to land remaining offshore, its storm surge remained less than initially forecast. The hurricane's track also placed its strongest storm surge in the eastern hemisphere of the storm, <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>any</b> landmasses. Surge heights peaked at 6ft (1.8m) near Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point. In Wilmington, Helene produced ocean swells at the coast 2.5 – 3 times per minute, indicative of a strong hurricane. There, the cumulative sea level was roughly 9ft (2.7m) above normal. However, {{as a result of}} the storm striking at low tide, damage caused by storm surge was mostly mitigated. Despite this, sand dunes in southern areas of Fort Fisher, were mostly destroyed by waves. On Cedar Island, strong winds produced by the hurricane pushed waves inland, inundating homes. Elsewhere, minor beach erosion occurred.|$|E

Three times he attained a paradise {{that turns out to}} be false, and this is followed by the death of a woman who are gone until the very end when Thalaba is awarded entrance into a true paradise. The seeking out of mythic figures to guide him onto the next part of the tale is equally repetitive and has little result for the plot. Various instances of the sorcerers and sorceresses are added to the story to emphasise the evil of magic along with tempting Thalaba with power. However, the emphasis on magic hides the moral within Thalaba's temptations. Although Thalaba does achieve his goal through moral submission, many of the quests and actions are arbitrary and repetitive. As such, they take <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>any</b> Islamic truth that could be found within the actions.|$|E
5|$|From September 28 to October 7, 33ships {{reported}} {{winds of}} over 40mph (65km/h) {{in relation to}} Kate, though nearly all occurred as the storm was becoming extratropical. The highest wind reported was 59mph (95km/h), while the lowest pressure reported from a ship was 989mbar. The interaction between Kate and a high pressure area to its north produced 3–4foot (1m) waves {{along the coast of}} North Carolina and New England. The strongest winds of Kate remained <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>any</b> landmasses, though the large circulation produced sustained winds of up to 40mph (65km/h) at Cape Race, Newfoundland. The storm also generated strong swells and surf along the southern portion of the Avalon Peninsula, reaching heights of 9–13feet (3–4m). The combination of moisture from Kate and a stalled frontal system produced moderate amounts of rainfall, with some regions in southeastern Newfoundland receiving more than 4inches (100mm). St. John's reported 1.8inches (45mm) on October 6, a record for the date. Due to dry conditions in the preceding weeks, the ground easily absorbed the water, resulting in a lack of flooding. The extratropical remnant of Hurricane Kate produced winds of up to 70mph (110km/h) in northern Scotland. Overall, there were no reports of damage or deaths associated with Kate.|$|E

5|$|On September 17, the {{intensification}} {{became more}} rapid and Helene {{quickly became a}} Category2 hurricane that morning as the eye became clearer and surrounded by deep convection. Helene also turned more northward and slowed down in the central Atlantic, which {{was in response to}} a weakness in the subtropical ridge farther north created by Gordon to the north. The northward turn shifted the course <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>any</b> land areas. The intensification continued through the afternoon, and that evening, Helene strengthened into a major hurricane with 115mph (185km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 962mbar. As shear remained low and the oceans remained warm, Helene intensified slightly more, peaking as a solid Category3 hurricane with 120mph (195km/h) winds early on September 18. At that time, Helene and Gordon were at roughly the same longitude in the open ocean. Operationally, Helene was estimated to have had 125mph (205km/h) winds, but the post-storm analysis downgraded it slightly. As Gordon moved eastward on the afternoon of 18th, a narrow ridge built in, forcing Helene westward. The eyewall collapsed somewhat, and Helene weakened slightly to a Category2 hurricane, where it leveled off for about 48hours until September 20 due to a lengthy eyewall replacement cycle and an elongated cloud pattern. On the 20th, Helene turned back to the northwest and weakened slightly due to a slight increase in wind shear. That afternoon, it was downgraded to a Category1 hurricane, which Helene remained until becoming extratropical.|$|E
5|$|About a {{month before}} Minh's junta was overthrown, Khánh was {{approached}} {{by one of the}} principal tacticians in the removal of Diệm, General Đỗ Mậu. A colonel {{at the time of the}} previous coup, Mậu had been head of military security under Diệm. Although he did not explicitly command troops, Mậu had a thorough knowledge of the backgrounds of most of the senior ARVN officers and their strengths and weaknesses. This had allowed him to help engineer the previous coup. The MRC respected Mậu, but their fears about his shrewdness led them to place him in the relatively powerless post of Minister of Information. Mậu's closest aides were posted further <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>any</b> real power in an attempt to fragment his networks of influence. Mậu began to search for officers to replace the junta, searching for exiles in Cambodia and France as well as those who had returned to Vietnam after the overthrow of Diệm. The most important link in Mậu's plan was Colonel Nguyễn Chánh Thi, the former paratroop commander who had fled to Cambodia in the wake of the failed 1960 coup attempt against Diệm. Mậu persuaded the junta to install Thi as Khánh's deputy in I Corps. He tricked the junta into doing so by reasoning that as Khánh had largely been responsible for putting down the 1960 revolt, Thi would be an ideal mechanism for keeping Khánh in check, claiming that the two would be implacably opposed to one another. Privately, Mậu predicted that Thi would be a bridge between him in Saigon and Khánh in Huế. He was correct in thinking that the 1960 conflict would be irrelevant in the shifting of allegiances over time and that the pair would work together for their current aims of advancement. Mậu recruited a second figure in the form of General Trần Thiện Khiêm, who was one of Khánh's fellow cadets and had worked with Mậu during the November coup. Khiêm had assisted Diệm in putting down the 1960 plot and had since been demoted from being Chief of Staff of the ARVN to the commander of the III Corps that surrounded Saigon. Khiêm readily joined the plot and controlled the 5th and 7th Divisions of the ARVN, which were based in Biên Hòa and Mỹ Tho north and south of Saigon respectively. This brought the two division commanders subordinate to Khiêm into the plot, as long as they would obey his orders. Khiêm, Khánh and Mậu kept in touch surreptitiously on a regular basis, supplementing their forces with an assortment of Marine, Air Force and Special Forces officers. Another was General Dương Văn Đức, who had recently returned from exile in Paris and was an assistant to Kim, the chief of the junta's general staff. During this time, the plotters received encouragement from Harkins through their American advisers, something seen as crucial to the plot's increasing momentum.|$|E
