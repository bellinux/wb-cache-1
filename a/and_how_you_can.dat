[...] Instead of dwelling on the past he is continually looking forward, [...] "You have to crank yourself {{up every morning and}} think about all the awful stuff you did yesterday, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> compensate for that by doing better today." [...] He does not read reviews of his work as he already knows – [...] "better than any reviewer" [...] – the places in which its faults lie.|$|E

60|$|My dearest Mr. Boyd,--I must {{thank you}} for the great great {{pleasure}} with which I have this moment read your note, the more welcome, as (without hypocrisy) I had worked myself up into a nervous apprehension, from your former one, that I should seem so 'rudis atque incomposita' to you, in consequence of certain licences, as to end by being intolerable. I know what an ear you have, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hear the dust on the wheel as it goes on. Well, I wrote to you yesterday, to beg you to be patient and considerate.|$|E

Why, you've lost your color and your looks and your weight since you came to stay here. They don't want such as you in the chorus.

But if any outsider comes between a highly charged correspondent and an electric wire, he does it at his peril. My dear Anerley, I tell you frankly {{that if you are}} going to handicap yourself with scruple you may just as well be in Fleet Street as in the Soudan. Our life is irregular. Our work has never been systematised. No doubt it will be some day, but the time is not yet. Do what you can <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> and be first on the wires; that's my advice to you; and also, that when next you come upon a campaign you bring with you the best horse that money can buy. Mortimer may beat me or I may beat Mortimer, but at least we know that between us we have the fastest ponies in the country. We have neglected no chance." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, fie, Mistress Eleanor; why, {{you would}} not ride to the wars?" [...] This was said by a woman of about four or five-and-twenty, tall, thin and spare, with a high colour, sharp black eyes, and a waist which the long stiff stays, laced in front, had pinched in till it was {{not much bigger than}} a wasp's, while her quilted green petticoat, {{standing}} out full below it, showed a very trim pair of ankles encased in scarlet stockings, and a pair of bony red arms came forth from the full short sleeves of a sort of white jacket, gathered in at the waist. She was clattering backwards and forwards, removing the dinner things, and talking to the children as she did so in a sharp shrill tone: [...] "Such a racket as you make, to be sure, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> have the heart to do so I can't guess, not I, considering what may be doing this very moment." ...|$|E

I doubt the security, both on your account, and on mine, of still leaving you at your father's house, to await my cure. Come to me here, therefore, to-morrow, at any hour when you can get away unperceived. You will be let in as a visitor, and shown to my bedside, if you ask for Mr. Turner--the name I have given to the hospital authorities. Through the help of a friend outside these walls, I have arranged for a lodging in which you can live undiscovered, until I am discharged and can join you. You can come here twice a week, if you like, and you had better do so, to accustom yourself to the sight of my injuries. I told you in my first letter how and where they had been inflicted--when you see them with your own eyes, you will be best prepared to hear what my future purposes are, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> aid them.|$|E
60|$|I have refrained {{till now}} from {{speaking}} to you much about missionaries, and the duty which lies on us all of helping missions. It {{seemed to me that}} I must first teach you to understand these first and second collects before I went on. to the third; that I must first teach you that you belonged to Christ's family, and that He had called each of you, and appointed each of you to some order and degree in His Holy Church. But now, if indeed you have learnt that--if my preaching here for fourteen years has had any effect to teach you who and what you are, and what your duty is, let me entreat you to go on, and take the lesson of that third collect, and think of those poor Jews, Turks, infidels, and heretics, who still--many a million of them--sit, or rather wander, and fall, and lie, miserably wallowing in darkness and the shadow of death, and think whether you cannot do something toward helping them. What you can do, and how it is to be done, I will tell you hereafter; and, by God's grace, I hope to see men of God in this pulpit, who having been missionaries themselves, can tell you better than I, what remains to be done, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> help to do it. But take home this one thought with you, this Good Friday,--Christ, who liveth and was dead, and behold He is alive for evermore, if He be indeed precious to you, if you indeed feel for His sufferings, if you indeed believe that what He bought by those sufferings was a right to all the souls on earth, then do what you can toward repaying Him for His sufferings, by seeing of the travail of His soul, and being satisfied. All the reward He asks, or ever asked, is the hearts of sinners, that He may convert them; the souls of sinners, that He may save them; and they belong to Him already, for He bought them this day with His own most precious blood. Do something, then, toward helping Christ to His own.|$|E
