5|$|In {{the third}} stage, four cyclists (Julien Gabory, Henri Gauban, Gaston Tuvache and Maurice Carrere) were disqualified {{for taking the}} train. The Ballon d'Alsace, which {{had been the first}} real {{mountain}} in the Tour de France the previous year, was featured <b>again.</b> <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> the year before, it was mounted first by Pottier. The stage was also won by Pottier, more than 45 minutes ahead of the rest.|$|E
5|$|BMC {{came to the}} Giro {{without a}} real overall {{classification}} hopeful. Sporting director Fabio Baldato stated that the team's nine-man squad was designed {{to give them a}} chance at a stage win every day, with Kristoff for the sprints, Kohler, Wyss, and Zahner for the breakaways, and Tschopp and Frank for the climbs. Rounding out the squad were young Americans Barton, Beyer, and Butler, riding the Giro mainly for experience. They constituted three of the seven Americans in the Giro peloton. The team's preparation for the Giro was also affected by the Mantova investigation, which resulted in the team's banning of Ballan and Santambrogio for the second time, after a previous ban in April 2010. <b>Again</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> in 2010, the two were reactivated shortly after the Giro concluded.|$|E
5|$|The Reformed {{tradition}} {{holds that}} baptism is primarily God's promise or offer of grace to the baptized. Baptism {{is said to}} signify union with Christ in his death, burial, and resurrection. The baptized is made one with Christ's person, meaning God the Father treats them the same as he treats Christ. Baptism also unites the baptized with Christ's history, meaning that the person {{can be said to}} have died, been buried, and raised <b>again</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> Christ was. The baptized person's identity in Christ is based on Christ's action in baptism rather than the person's action. This union also unites Christians to one another. Through the words of institution used in baptism, Christians are also united to each {{of the members of the}} trinity.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{opened his}} {{campaign}} with {{a speech at}} Bowling Green on August26, 1899. He answered many allegations {{that had been made}} about him, including claims that he had secretly been seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination all along, that he had ambitions of succeeding Senator William Joseph Deboe, and that following the nominating convention, he had agreed to speak on behalf of the Goebel ticket. Brown conceded that he desired Senator Deboe's senate seat and that he had agreed to accept the gubernatorial nomination if it had been offered to him, but he denied that he had ever agreed to speak on Goebel's behalf. Outgoing Senator Blackburn also charged that Brown was bolting the party <b>again,</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> he had in supporting Stephen Douglas over John C. Breckinridge for president in 1860. Brown replied by quoting an article by William Jennings Bryan's Omaha World-Herald that asserted the right of an individual to vote against the nominee of his party if the individual deemed the nominee unfit.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{restoration}} to Byzantine rule, relations between Thessalonica and Constantinople remained troubled, with Thessalonica's local aristocracy jealously guarding their extensive privileges, which apparently amounted to virtual autonomy. This {{was part of}} a wider phenomenon for several cities during the last century of Byzantine history, as the state's central authority weakened. In Thessalonica's case, a tendency of independence from the imperial capital had been evident at least since the Zealot movement of the mid-14th century, and had been reinforced by Manuel II's autonomous regime in 1382–1387. Thus, Thessalonica and the surrounding region were given as an autonomous appanage to John VII Palaiologos. After his death in 1408, he was succeeded by Manuel's third son, the Despot Andronikos Palaiologos, who was supervised by Demetrios Leontares until 1415. During this time, Thessalonica enjoyed a period of relative peace and prosperity, as the Turks were preoccupied with their own civil war, but was attacked by the rival Ottoman pretenders in 1412 (by Musa Çelebi) and 1416 (during the uprising of Mustafa Çelebi against Mehmed I). Once the Ottoman civil war ended, the Turkish pressure on the city began to increase <b>again.</b> <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> during the 1383–1387 siege, this led to a sharp division of opinion within the city between factions supporting resistance, if necessary with Western help, or submission to the Ottomans.|$|E
25|$|In November 1968, Leonard joined The Bystanders, {{to replace}} Vic Oakley (<b>again),</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> the band changed their musical direction, from close harmony pop to a psychedelic/American west coast style, and their name to Man.|$|E
60|$|For {{days that}} ghost {{declined}} to stir, A foggy shapeless giant-- For weeks that splendid officer Stared back <b>again</b> defiant. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> the Englishman returned The goblin's vulgar staring, Just so the Scotchman boldly spurned The ghost's unmannered scaring.|$|R

60|$|At last he {{was sure}} that Hooty had left. Once more he climbed up to his little round doorway and there he waited some time before poking even his nose outside. Then, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> he had made up his mind to go out, that terrible sound rang out <b>again,</b> and <b>just</b> <b>as</b> before he tumbled heels over head down on his bed.|$|R
25|$|To {{take the}} {{pressure}} off the infantry, Schustekh charged <b>again,</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> Thierry's lost dragoons showed up. At first, the attack went well, but then the Austrian horsemen came up against a mass of cuirassiers. The result was a rout of the Habsburg cavalry, who rode {{through the ranks of}} their own foot soldiers. The French chasseurs and cuirassiers rode roughshod over the troops of Thierry and Mesko, cutting down the fugitives. Over 3,000 Austrians became prisoners, including Thierry, and four cannon were lost.|$|E
25|$|A storm {{kept the}} ship at Naples until Sunday afternoon, when Captain Bartlett {{decided to take}} {{advantage}} of a brief break in the weather and continue. The seas rose once <b>again</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> Britannic left the port. However, by next morning, the storms died and the ship passed the Strait of Messina without problems. Cape Matapan was rounded in the first hours of 21 November. By the morning, Britannic was steaming at full speed into the Kea Channel, between Cape Sounion (the southernmost point of Attica, the prefecture that includes Athens) and the island of Kea.|$|E
25|$|In {{the event}} that all ten pins are felled by any one player in a single box, {{by no more than}} two throws (just as in tenpins) bonuses are awarded for a strike or spare. A strike is {{achieved}} with just the first delivery downing all ten pins, with a spare needing two throws, <b>again</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> in the tenpin sport. If all ten pins are felled by rolling all three balls in a box, the result is a Ten or ten-box, usually marked by an X (as in the Roman numeral for ten) but no additional points are awarded. (In tenpin bowling, a strike is often scored with an X).|$|E

50|$|Pygmalion, {{completing}} his statue of Galatea, is {{madly in love}} with it. To his delight, Galatea comes to life. When he tries to embrace her, however, she magically changes place; then her upper and lower halves come apart, much to Pygmalion's confusion. Galatea's halves join back together <b>again,</b> but <b>just</b> <b>as</b> he is about to kiss her at last, she steps back onto her pedestal and becomes a statue again.|$|R
25|$|With the Salon d'Automne of {{that same}} year, 1911, the fury broke out <b>again,</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> violent {{as it had been}} at the Indépendants. I {{remember}} this Room 8 in the Grand Palais on the opening day. People were crushed together, shouting, laughing, calling for our heads. And what had we hung? Metzinger his lovely canvas entitled Le Goûter; Léger his sombre Nus dans un Paysage; Le Fauconnier, landscapes done in the Savoie; myself La Chasse and the Portrait de Jacques Nayral. How distant it all seems now! But I can still see the crowd gathering together in the doors of the room, pushing at those who were already pressed into it, wanting to get in to see for themselves the monsters that we were.|$|E
25|$|On 5 October, the 21st Division {{captured}} a blockhouse and next day a reconnaissance by the 2nd Australian Division revealed Daisy Wood to be strongly held. On 7 October, parties from the 49th Division (II Anzac Corps) raided Celtic Wood and the 48th (South Midland) Division (XVIII Corps) was repulsed at Burns House and Vacher Farm. Celtic Wood was raided by {{a battalion of}} the 1st Australian Division on 9 October. There was anxiety among the higher British commanders about wet weather affecting operations <b>again,</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> the Germans appeared {{to be close to}} collapse. The increased tempo of attack allowed by the systematic planning and decentralisation of responsibility from army to corps and divisions and the reduction of much of the planning to a routine, led to the time between attacks being further reduced. Faster attack preparations reduced the time available for artillery to prepare assaults, which combined with the return of heavy rain after 4 October, substantially to reduce British artillery support during the battles of Poelcapelle on 9 October and the First Battle of Passchendaele on 12 October. As optimism at the possibility of advancing over the Passchendaele watershed increased the weather broke.|$|E
2500|$|Design and {{manufacturing}} costs for new, larger ride systems were increasing and competition was intense. [...] Bankruptcy loomed once <b>again</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> Arrow introduced the X (subsequently known as X2) at Six Flags Magic Mountain, a 4th dimension roller coaster designed by Alan Schilke. X opened to massive media attention and received an initially positive reception; however, several mechanical problems caused {{the ride to}} be closed for repairs during much of its first year of operation.|$|E
60|$|In half an hour, the dispositions were made. The valley was wide, at this point; {{and there}} were some five or six villages nestled in it. It was pretty thickly wooded and, two miles behind, narrowed <b>again</b> considerably. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> the troops had gained their {{appointed}} places, a faint sound of heavy musketry fire was heard, in the gorge ahead; mingled, in a few minutes, with the deep boom of cannon.|$|R
60|$|Pereira loaded <b>again,</b> and <b>just</b> <b>as</b> he had capped {{his rifle}} three more geese, also flying low, came over, {{preceded by a}} number of ducks, passing {{straight}} above us, as they must do owing to the shape of the gap between the land waves of the veld above through which they flighted. Pereira shot, and to my surprise, the second, not the first, bird fell, also a good way behind him.|$|R

Then he tried the bank <b>again,</b> and <b>just</b> <b>as</b> before he slipped back two steps for every three he went up.

2500|$|Albert Gleizes {{writes of}} the Salon d'Automne of 1911: [...] "With the Salon d'Automne {{of that same}} year, 1911, the fury broke out <b>again,</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> violent {{as it had been}} at the Indépendants." [...] He writes: [...] "The {{painters}} were the first to be surprised by the storms they had let loose without intending to, merely because they had hung on the wooden bars that run along the walls of the Cours-la-Reine, certain paintings that had been made with great care, with passionate conviction, but also in a state of great anxiety." ...|$|E

2500|$|The gold, {{protected}} by the 173rd regiment of the NKVD, was immediately moved to the State Depository for Valuables (Goskhran), in Moscow, where it was received as a deposit according to a protocol, dated November 5, by which a reception commission was established. The gold arrived at the Soviet capital a day before the 19th anniversary of the October Revolution. According to Orlov, Joseph Stalin celebrated {{the arrival of the}} gold with a banquet attended by members of the politburo, in which he was famously quoted as saying, [...] "The Spaniards will never see their gold <b>again,</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> they don't see their ears," [...] an expression based on a Russian proverb.|$|E
60|$|His {{speech was}} getting wonderfully intelligible {{in spite of}} the strange voice, which had at first almost seemed a thing to make her cross herself.

2500|$|I {{have always}} {{regarded}} Paine {{as one of}} the greatest of all Americans. Never have we had a sounder intelligence in this republic ... It was my good fortune to encounter Thomas Paine's works in my boyhood ... it was, indeed, a revelation to me to read that great thinker's views on political and theological subjects. Paine educated me, then, about many matters of which I had never before thought. I remember, very vividly, the flash of enlightenment that shone from Paine's writings, and I recall thinking, at that time, 'What a pity these works are not today the schoolbooks for all children!' My interest in Paine was not satisfied by my first reading of his works. I went back to them time and <b>again,</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> I have done since my boyhood days.|$|E

[...] Pedro enters, masked, and reveals that he will be fighting Antonio, relieving some of Florinda's fears. Belvile enters, disguised as Antonio. Pedro accuses [...] "Antonio" [...] of having [...] "the advantage of me in Angellica" [...] and the men start to fight. Florinda runs in to stop them. Belvile is confused as to why Florinda would defend his rival but they push her away and fight. [...] Florinda stops them <b>again</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> Belvile disarms Pedro. She begs him [...] "by her you love" [...] to spare Pedro. Belvile lays his sword at Florinda’s feet and swears his love to her. The action redeems him in Pedro’s eyes, so he gives his sister to the man he believes to be Antonio, demanding that they get married at once. Florinda protests, but Belvile secretly lifts his mask to show her who he is.|$|E
2500|$|Total cleanup {{time for}} most of the beaches was about 45 days after the initial spill, {{although}} globs of tar continued to wash ashore due to the high seep rate, and bigger patches came ashore during subsequent spills. [...] Most beaches were open to the public by June 1, although some of the rocky areas on the shore were not cleaned until around August 15. [...] Yet oil continued to pool and wash up on shore; on August 26, the harbor was so full of oil that once again it had to be closed, with cleanup crews spreading straw from boats to bunch the oil up <b>again,</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> they had six months before. [...] Indeed, oil from the spill persisted in the ocean into 1970, with large areas of crude still being observed. [...] Since the spill occurred during the stormy season, when beach sand is at its lowest levels (it replenishes {{during the course of a}} normal spring and summer), one fear was that regions of oily sand would be revealed during the following winter; however this did not happen.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the report}} titled “Born <b>Again</b> Christians <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> Likely to Divorce as Are Non-Christians,” Barna {{uses the word}} evangelicals interchangeably with born again .... In other words, the broadly defined evangelical church as a whole in America and the West in general is {{apparently}} not very unlike the world. It goes to church on Sunday and has a veneer of religion, but its religion is basically an add-on to the same way of life the world lives, not a transforming power.|$|R
