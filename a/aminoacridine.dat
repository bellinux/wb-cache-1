In this paper, we report the effect of spermine conjugation on the cytotoxic and transport properties of acridine. Six derivatives, composed of a spermine chain attached at its N- 1 position to an acridine via an aliphatic chain, were synthesized. The aliphatic linker, comprised of 3 - 5 methylene units, was connected to the position- 9 of the heterocycle through either an amide (amidoacridines 8 - 10) or an amine (<b>aminoacridines</b> 11 - 13) linkage. Independently of their architecture, all ligands showed a high affinity for DNA binding but a limited DNA sequence selectivity. In a whole cell assay with L 1210 and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, the <b>aminoacridines</b> (IC 50 values around 2 muM) were more potent than the amidoacridines (IC 50 values between 20 and 40 muM). This was related to a less efficient transport for the latter. As determined from competitive uptake studies with [C- 14]spermidine, all conjugates had a high affinity for the polyamine transport system (PTS). However, on the basis of competitive studies with an excess of spermidine and on the differential effect on cell growth and accumulation in CHO and in the mutant PTS deficient CHO-MG cells, the accumulation of the conjugates through the PTS was found to be poor but still more efficient for the <b>aminoacridines.</b> alpha-Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, which induces an up-regulation of the activity of the PTS, enhanced accumulation of all acridine conjugates through the PTS and had a synergistic effect on the potency of the acridine conjugates to inhibit cell growth. Despite, their high affinity for the PTS, the low amount of derivatives transiting through the PTS is likely to be related to their ability to repress rapidly and efficiently the activity of the PTS and, consequently, to inhibit their own uptake via this system...|$|R

After {{the discovery of}} acridine in the late 1800 's, the acridine class of molecules attracted much synthetic interest due to their usefulness as dyestuffs and the discovery that certain acridine derivatives possessed anti-bacterial properties. It was this discovery that lead <b>aminoacridines</b> to be used heavily as anti-bacterial agents until they were supplanted {{by the use of}} sulfonamides and the discovery of the penicillin's. Despite falling out of favor as anti-bacterial agents, acridine derivatives were still used in the treatment of other diseases such as malaria and cancer. Despite falling out of use as anti-bacterial agents, one area where the acridine class of compounds may find a new use is in the treatment of drug-resistant bacterial infections, namely MRSA. Infections caused by numerous drug-resistant bacteria have become a major health issue in the world today which has led to a pressing need for the development of novel agents to treat these infections. We report within this thesis the synthesis and evaluation of numerous acridine and acridone based compounds that possess activity against a number of strains of MRSA.

40|$|Isonitriles (isocyanides) {{are known}} to reveal more or less {{nucleophilic}} properties in the electronic ground state. So far very {{little attention has been}} paid to the chemical properties of the excited state. This thesis describes the formation of cyclohept[b] indoles by irradiation of o-isocyanobiphenyl in cyclohexane. It is a new reaction which reveals electrophilic properties of the isocyanide group in the excited state. It appears to be the first example of an aromatic ring expansion by insertion of an isocyano carbon. Cyclohept [b] indole is also formed upon irradiation of o-isothiocyanatobiphenyl. This reaction proceeds via the initial formation of o-isocyanobiphenyl and sulfur (Chapter II). The subject has been extended (Chapter III) to the irradiation of 2,X'-diisocyanobiphenyls (X = 2, 3, or 4) in cyclohexane. The produced isomeric 7 -, 8 -, 9 - and 1 0 -isocyanocyclohept [b] indoles are stable compounds. The 6 -isocyanocyclohept[blindole, anticipated to be formed upon irradiation of 2, 21 -diisocyanobiphenyl, could not be isolated. However, derivatives were found which indicate its initial formation. It is assumed, that a rapid intramolecular cyclization of 6 -isocyanocyclohept[b]indole gives an intermediate which behaves like a nucleophilic amino carbene. This intermediate allows a straightforward explanation of the actual derivatives found. In Chapter IV' a spectroscopic study is made of the isocyanocyclohept[b] indoles. Evidence is obtained for a fairly strong mesomeric interaction between the isocyano function and the heterocyclic system. The basicities of the isocyanocyclohept[b] indoles are appreciably lower (ca 2 pKa units) than that of the unsubstituted compound. The isocyanocyclohept[b] indoles are easily hydrolyzed to the corresponding aminocyclohept [bJ indoles. The pKa values of the latter compounds are compared with those of the isomeric <b>aminoacridines</b> and aminophenanthridines. The aminocyclohept[b] -indoles turn out to be much more basic than most of the isomers (pKa ca 9. 5). Irradiation of o-isocyanobiphenyl in methanol (Chapter V) produced phenanthridine as the main product besides a small amount of cyclohept[b]indole. Evidence has been found that the formation of the phenanthridine does not result from a direct insertion reaction of the isocyano-carbon into the ortho C-H bond of the adjacent phenyl ring. A theory has been developed, which explains the different course of the photochemical reaction in cyclohexane and methanol. ...|$|R

Optimal photocleaving activity was observed for conjugate 16, in which a flexible polymethylene spacer of 4 carbons was used to connect the <b>aminoacridine</b> entity to the thiopyridone.

40|$|Amsacrine is an anilinoacridine {{derivative}} anticancer drug, used {{to treat}} {{a wide variety of}} malignancies. In cells, amsacrine poisons topoisomerase 2 by stabilizing DNA-drug-enzyme ternary complex. Presence of amsacrine increases the steady-state concentration of these ternary complexes which in turn hampers DNA replication and results in subsequent cell death. Due to reversible binding and rapid slip-out of amsacrine from DNA duplex, structural data is not available on amsacrine-DNA complexes. In the present work, we designed five oligonucleotide duplexes, differing in their minor groove widths and hydration pattern, and examined their binding with amsacrine using attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy.

40|$|In {{contrast}} with most other lipid substrates, {{in this article}} we show that liposomes prepared from the total myelin lipids exhibited a negligible proton permeability. Neither the generation of valinomycin-induced potassium diffusion potentials as high as - 177 mV nor the imposition of large pH gradients (up to three units) was able to produce a substantial flux of protons through liposomal membranes, as determined by the distribution of [14 C]-methylamine, or the changes in the fluorescence of the probes 9 - <b>aminoacridine,</b> acridine orange, and pyranine. The presence of cations (Na+, K+, Ca 2 +) did not alter this behavior. Voltage clamping did not increase the transmembrane ΔpH-driven proton permeability. However, liposome diameter was found to be critical because small unilamellar vesicles displayed a much higher proton permeability than large unilamellar or multilamellar vesicles. This abnormally low proton permeability is interpreted by virtue of the characteristic biochemical composition of myelin lipid matrix, with a high content of cholesterol and sphingolipids and a very low level of free fatty acids. These results could be important for elucidating the role of myelin in the regulation of pH in the brain.

In an axon with intact h gate, the block exhibits frequency- and voltage-dependent characteristics. However, in the pronase-perfused axon, the frequency- dependent block disappears, whereas the voltage-dependent block remains unchanged.

40|$|The {{appearance}} of lysosomes {{and the distribution}} of lysosomal enzymes have been studied in a number of cell cultures exposed to viruses. Lysosomes were shown by fluorescence microscopy after vital staining with aminoacridines and light microscopy after vital staining with neutral red. The lysosomal enzymes studied histochemically in unfixed and fixed cells were acid phosphatase and 5 -bromo- 4 -chloro-indoxyl acetate esterase. Activation of lysosomal enzymes was found to take place in three stages. The first is characterized by permeability of lysosomal membranes without release of enzymes. This is demonstrable by staining of lysosomal enzymes in unfixed cells and by increased uptake of <b>aminoacridine</b> fluorochromes and neutral red into lysosomes. In cell sheets initially stained with neutral red this gives rise to red plaques. This stage can be fully reversible; cells infected with, and yielding, the red-plaque strain of NDV, recover fully afterwards. In the second stage lysosomal enzymes are released into the cytoplasm, the cells round up and there is decreased uptake of aminoacridines and neutral red into lysosomes. In cell monolayers this results in the formation of white plaques. In the third stage, not usually seen in cell cultures, lysosomal enzymes are released from or inactivated in the cells and are not seen in either fixed or unfixed preparations.

40|$|Inkjet ink {{analysis}} {{is the best}} way to discriminate between printed documents, or even though more difficult, to connect an inkjet printed document with a brand or model of printers. Raman spectroscopy and laser desorption mass spectrometry (LDMS) have been demonstrated as powerful tools for dyes and pigments analysis, which are ink components. The aim of this work is to evaluate the aforementioned techniques for inkjet inks analysis in terms of discriminating power, information quality, and nondestructive capability. So, we investigated 10 different inkjet ink cartridges (primary colors and black), 7 from the HP manufacturer and one each from Epson, Canon and Lexmark. This paper demonstrates the capabilities of three methods: Raman spectroscopy, LDMS and MALDI-MS. Raman spectroscopy, as it is preferable to try the nondestructive approach first, is successfully adapted to the analysis of color printed documents in most cases. For analysis of color inkjet inks by LDMS, we show that a MALDI matrix (9 - <b>aminoacridine,</b> 9 AA) is needed to desorb and to ionize dyes from most inkjet inks (except Epson inks). Therefore, a method was developed to apply the 9 AA MALDI matrix directly onto the piece of paper while avoiding analyte spreading. The obtained mass spectra are very discriminating and lead to information about ink additives and paper compositions. Discrimination of black inkjet printed documents is more difficult because of the common use of carbon black as the principal pigment. We show for the first time the possibility to discriminate between two black-printed documents coming from different, as well as from the same, manufacturers. Mass spectra recorded from black inks in positive ion mode LDMS detect polyethylene glycol polymers which have characteristic mass distributions and end groups. Moreover, software has been developed for rapid and objective comparison of the low mass range of these positive mode LDMS spectra which have characteristic unknown peaks. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{an account of}} studies made on the {{distribution}} and nature of acid mucopolysaccharides in the mammalian renal papilla. The papilla {{was found to be}} the only region of the kidney which has an appreciable extracellular space with acid mucopolysaccharide enmeshed in connective tissue fibres. Animals are unable to secrete urine which is either more concentrated or more dilute than plasma unless the tonicity of this region is greater than that of plasma. In {{the first part of this}} work (Chapter 2) the extent of extracellular acid mucopolysaccharide was correlated with the ability of the species to conserve water. It was found that the papilla could be sharply delineated by staining the acid mucopolysaccharide within it. This had the advantage over the less distinct cut surface appearances in that it was possible accurately to measure the length of the papilla in relation to that of the cortex and medulla in stained sections. An empirical relationship between the development of the papilla and the ability to secrete hypertonic urine was obtained for a number of species: U max = 1. 74 (Mandprime;/Candprime;) + 0. 6, where U max is the maximum concentration in Osmols/litre that can be achieved in the urine; Mandprime; is the length of the papilla, measured as the distance of the region containing extracellular acid mucopolysaccharide from the papillary tip towards the renal cortex; and Candprime; is the continuation of this line through the medulla and cortex. The correlation coefficient for the six species for which figures for maximum urinary concentration were known was 0. 9. The significance of this expression is discussed in Chapter 2 in relation to a similar equation put forward by Black in 1965. The morphology of the connective tissue in the papilla of the guinea pig was examined by light and electron microscopy (Chapter 3) and by histochemistry (Chapter 4). The histological results were correlated with the electrophoretic and staining characteristics of acid mucopolysaccharides extracted from this region. There was very little collagen of the adult type to be found in the papilla. The main fibrillar component was reticulin which was well demonstrated by silver impregnation and the periodic acid - Schiff technique. Within the reticulin mesh another class of PAS positive fibril was found which, in addition, stained positively for anionic groups. These fibrils could not be impregnated with silver. In the electron microscope the second class of fibril was seen not to be banded and to be smaller than the reticulin fibrils. The histochemical results (Chapter 4) showed that the largest part of the amorphous extracellular acid mucopolysaccharide in the papilla was hyaluronic acid. In addition, two quantitatively small fractions were observed in the biochemical extracts which were associated with the extracellular acid mucopolysaccharide. Both these fractions stained metachromatically with thiazine dyes and were shown to incorporate radioactive sulphate. In sections metachromatic extracellular material was confined to the tip of the papilla: In this region of high in vivo osmotic pressures the interstitial cells also contained monochromatic granules. The exact nature of these two fractions was not elucidated, nor was an attempt made to identify the intracellular granules with its synthesis or destruction. The results from the morphometry of the kidneys of fourteen species (Table 2 / 1) showed that desert species have long papillae which contain a limited amount of connective tissue. The metachromatic staining of extracellular acid mucopolysaccharides extends further towards the cortex in those species which can secrete highly concentrated urine. On the other hand, the papillae of animals which habitually produce dilute urine were squat in outline and contained abundant connective tissue. The tip of the papilla in these species was not found to stain set metachromatically. The extent of metachromasia was thus found to be related to the development of high tonicity in vivo, and thus to be most prominent in that part of the papilla where the sodium concentration is greatest in life. It was observed histologically that acid mucopolysaccharide was associated with the lateral spaces between collecting tubule cells in the guinea pig. It had been suggested by Ginetzinsky in 1958 that the material found between these cells in the rat constituted the barrier between fluid in the collecting tubule lumen and the interstitium. He postulated that antidiuretic hormone released hyaluronidase from the apex of the collecting tubule cell and that the enzyme then digested the intercellular cement permitting tubular fluid to equilibrate osmotically with the interstitium. The material between collecting tubule cells the guinea pig was extracted and information about its nature was obtained from its behaviour in electrophoresis and from its staining characteristics. It was found to be a very soluble acid mucopolysaccharide which contained sulphate and PAS positive groups, both of which features distinguish it from hyaluronic acid. The histological technique had thus to be modified to preserve as much as possible of the material in the thin (3 andnbsp;andmu;) wax sections required for the optimal demonstration of this region in the light microscope. The fixative developed to give the most satisfactory retention of acid mucopolysaccharide at the same time as preserving cytological structure reasonably well was as follows: Formol (40 % CHO) 100 ml Cellosolve 225 ml Distilled water 45 ml <b>Aminoacridine</b> hydrochloride 1. 6 gm. After fixation the tissue blocks were passed directly into pure cellosolve: Rinsing in aqueous solutions was avoided. <b>Aminoacridine</b> hydrochloride is soluble in cellosolve hence excess precipitant was removed during dehydration without running the risk that acid mucopolysaccharide might be leached out. The blocks were cleared in the usual way and then embedded in ester wax which was found to be superior to paraffin wax for a number of reasons discussed in Chapter 4. Radioactive sulphate was used to trace the synthesis of acid mucopolysaccharide by the collecting tubule cells. After injection of the label, radioactivity was first seen in sections to be associated with PAS positive, amylase resistant granules in the Golgi regions of the collecting tubule cells. After longer intervals radioactivity became associated with granules near the apical and lateral borders of the cells. The Golgi region as demonstrated morphologically (Chapter 3) was always seen to be between the nucleus and apical or lateral borders of the cell and never between the nucleus and the base. Similarly, material which had incorporated radioactive sulphate was never seen to pass across the base of a collecting tubule cell. The reasons for associating the development of an extensive Golgi region with the synthesis of acid mucopolysaccharide by these cells is discussed in connection with the results published by others working with embryonically similar gut cells. It proved possible by autoradiography to identify positively the material in the biochemical extract that had come from the collecting tubule cells. Autoradiography of tissue sections one hour after injection of the label showed that radioactivity was limited to the collecting tubule cells: Similarly only one band in the electrophoretic separation of acid mucopolysaccharides extracted from the papilla after this interval contained radioactivity. By noting how this band stained before and after the action of enzymes upon the material within it, it was concluded that the material associated with collecting tubule cells had the following features: It contained protein which could not be digested by papain. It contained a limited amount of 'neutral' polysaccharide which could be stained by the PAS routine. It could not be digested by amylase. It stained as strongly at pH 1 with Alcian Blue as it did at pH 3. 5 : This indicated that its anionic groups were sulphate and that carboxyl groups placed little part in the staining. It incorporated radioactive sulphate. The acid mucopolysaccharide component was partially degraded by commercial bovine testicular hyaluronidase. In Chapter 5 the changes in the morphology of acid mucopolysaccharides in the interstitium and between collecting tubule cells that arise when guinea pigs are dehydrated, injected with ADH or hyaluronidase, or given a water load are recorded. In animals given a water load the structural fibrils of the papillary interstitium become widely separated and, at the same time, the apparent space between tubules is increased. However, morphometry showed that the actual volume of the interstitium did not alter significantly whether the animal was water laden, deprived of water or injected with ADH. The significance of this observation is discussed in view of the contrary reports concerning changes in interstitial volumes: In the present study it was concluded that hydration of the acid mucopolysaccharide gel trapped within the fibrils accounted for their expanded appearance in diuresis. In antidiuresis papillary tubules were closely packed and a number of thin walled vessels, which were not normally observed by light microscopy appeared to be pulled open. This observation could be explained by contraction of interstitial cells under the influence of ADH, or by an increased force exerted on certain fibrils in the interstitium as a result of local changes in the physical propertied of acid mucopolysaccharides. No evidence could be found in this study to support active contraction of the interstitial cells. A model (Fig. 6 / 3) is presented to explain how a system of fibrils ad hyaluronic acid could enable water to be removed from the papilla in antidiuresis without a reduction in the tonicity of the papilla as a whole. The difference in volume of collecting tubule cells in hydration and dehydration was measured. In both cases the basal width of the cells averaged 9. 4 andnbsp;andmu; under the conditions of measurement. The average length of the cells in hydration was 13 andnbsp;andmu; falling to 10 andnbsp;andmu; on ADH infection or water deprivation. The change from columnar to cuboidal shape decreased the cell volume by 23 %. Autoradiographic evidence was obtained which showed that the acid mucopolysaccharide associated with the apex of the collecting tubule cell was depolymerized in antidiuresis. The removal of a layer of acid mucopolysaccharide from this site could account for most of the volume change noted 1 n sections not stained for acid mucopolysaccharides. It was possible that there was also some shrinkage of the cytoplasmic volume by osmosis in antidiuresis but the evidence for this was equivocal. There was nothing in the results from this study to support the hypothesis that hyaluronidase was released by apocrine secretion from the collecting tubule cells. 'Granules' of a size which could just be resolved optically (ie. of andfrac 14; to andfrac 12;andnbsp;andmu; in dia.) could be seen between collecting tubule cells (fig. 4 / 6). These 'granules' contained anionic groups which stained in the same way as the material at the apex of the cells. The resolution that is possible with light microscopical autoradiography was insufficient to prove that these particles incorporated sulphate in parallel with the apical material. The arrangement of the Golgi region in these cells (fig. 3 / 12) suggested that secretion took place into the lateral intercellular spaces as well as across the apex. However, granules were never seen between the cells in the electron microscope, and it is suggested that the granular appearance of this region in the light microscope arises from the plane of section of the cellular interdigitations. The amount of acid mucopolysaccharide between collecting tubule cells wan reduced when guinea pigs were deprived of water or given ADH. Removal of apical material with preservation of that between cells, or vice versa, was never observed. This result is discussed in Chapter 6, and a model is put forward to explain how such a system could regulate the flow of water across the collecting tubule wall. The evidence arising from studies by other workers which suggests a role for a hyaluronic acid/hyaluronidase system in the physiology of the kidney is reviewed in Chapter 6 : This, and the criticism of the hypothesis of Ginetzinsky (1958) is discussed in the light of findings in the present study. It is concluded that renal acid mucopolysaccharides are involved in maintaining the constancy of the 'milieu interior' of the papilla, which determines that of the blood and ultimately of the whole body. It is thought that an understanding of the actual mechanisms by which they do this has probably been delayed by the modern emphasis on cellular activity with the result that the functional significance of connective tissue has tended to be overlooked. </p...|$|E
40|$|Histochemical {{techniques}} {{suitable for}} fluorescence microscopy {{have been developed}} for the detection of the principal chemical groupings and substances likely to be present in tissue sections. The mechanisms and specificities of the chosen reactions were confirmed wherever possible. The following methods were found to be the most satisfactory for the detection of: Amines An extremely intense green fluorescent product was produced in sites of proteins in tissue sections treated witha methanolic solution of pyridine containing a few drops of aqueous cyanogen bromide solution (the König-Sassi reaction). Treatment of sections with an alkaline solution of salicylaldehyde gave a thermolabile, green fluorescent conjugate. Tryptophane residues gave a characteristic purple fluorescence after reaction with a solution of dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in hydrochloric acid. The complex formed by mixing solutions of Solochrome dyes and alum fluoresced red after adsorption onto acidophilic primary and polymethyl amino groups. Chloraraine T oxidised the primary amine groups of α-amino-acid residues to aldehydes which were subsequently demonstrated as their blue fluorescent salicyloylhydrasones. The specificity of the preceding reactions were confirmed by the following deamination experiments. The diazotisation of amine groups with a cold solution of sodium nitrite and sulphuric acid, followed by diazotisation with warm ethanol was usually effective, out took some time to accomplish. Oxidative deamination with a dilute solution of sodium hypochlorite within the pH range 5. 5 - 7. 0 worked very efficiently and rapidly. Stable aldehydes were produced predominantly in nuclear sites provided the excess hypochlorite in the sections was destroyed by washing them in a neutral solution of ammonia containing a trace of copper sulphate. Cytophasmic proteins were probably converted to ketoacids. If sodium thiosulphate was used for destroying the excess hypochlorite, the induced aldehydes were destroyed. Instead strongly besophillc groupings, probably derivatives of sulphonic acids, were formed in both protoplasmic and nuclear proteins. Many of the reagents suggested by Danielli (1950) for blocking amine groups were found to be ineffective. Thiols Thiols condensed with N-ethyl maleimide (NEM) selectively to give a product containing an unconjugated ketone group. The zinc complex of the non-fluorescent hydrazone of the NEM-thiol conjugate derived from salicyloyl hydrazide fluoresced bluish-green. When all the basophilic substances and compounds containing hydroxyl groups were extracted from tissue sections by treating them with methanolic hydrochloric acid at 60 Â°- 90 Â° for several hours (drastic methylation), {{it was found that the}} remaining thiol groups could be converted to basophilic thiosulphonic acids by exposing dry sections afterwards to sulphuryl chloride vapour. These acid groups exhibited an anomalous bright blue fluorescence after the treated section had been stained in dilute solutions of auramine O or acridine yellow. Disulphides Oxidation with peracids yielded basophilic sulphinic acids which were unique in resisting methylation. Subsequent staining with coriphosphine gave an intense red fluorescence in the oxidised sites. Previous blocking of other basophilic materials with methanolic thionyl chloride and of thiols with iodoacetate was essential. Phenols Indirect method. Acidified solutions of 1 -nitroso- 2 -naphthol containing a trace of sodium nitrite coupled with tyrosine-rich sites to form an unstable green fluorescent conjugate. This test relied on the activating influence of the phenolic group on the ortho- and para- positions in the aromatic nucleus. The specificity of the reaction was confirmed by iodinating these positions. Direct method. Dinitrofluorobenzene reacted only with phenols and thiols (but not amines) at a pH below 5. 5. By blocking the latter with iodoacetate, only the former reacted. The nitro groups of the conjugate were reduced to amines, but unfortunately attempts to demonstrate these groups by fluorescent methods (1) were unsuccessful. Carboxylic acids C-terminal carboxyl groups have been converted to methyl ketones by treating them with a mixture of acetic anhydride and pyridine at 60 Â°. The ketones thus formed were demonstrated as the Blue fluorescent zinc complexes of their salicyloyl hydrazones. This, and other experimental evidence, vitiated the hypothesis put forward by Karnovsky and Fasman (1960) that the principal reaction here was the conversion of the side-chain carboxyl groups to mixed acid anhydrides. Sites containing side-chain carboxyl groups were detected by the changes in the colour of their fluorescence from blue to green in tissue sections stained with 0. 01 % solutions of coriphosphine at pH 2 - 3 and at PH 5. The interference of the C- terminal carboxyl groups was eliminated by previously converting then to their methyl ketones (5 a). RNA was also extracted beforehand with hot perchloric acid. Nucleic acids Zirconium ions had en affinity for the phosphate groups of both types of nucleic acid which were subsequently demonstrated as their greenish-yellow fluorescent complex with morin. DNA yielded an aldehyde after brief (Feulgen) hydrolysis which was subsequently detectable as its blue fluorescent salicyloyl hydrazone. Sulphates No direct chemical methods have been found, but the presence of this group (in acid mucopolysaccharides) was inferred from the following tests: Their basophilia (towards coriphosphine) when counterstained with the acid dye, thiazol yellow. Acid mucopolysaccharides, containing only acid groups, exhibited the brown or red fluorescence of coriphosphine, while the nucleic acids and proteins fluoresced a light yellow or blue as a result of the very strong interaction between their basic amino groups and the acid dye. Their basophilia (towards coriphosphine) after selective extraction of nucleic acids. Methylation and reduction of tissue sections with lithium aluminium hydride in hot dioxane removed phosphate groups selectively. Uronic acid groups and some protein carboxyl groups were reduced to primary alcohols. Subsequent saponification and staining showed a reddish-brown fluorescence in sites containing acid mucopolysaccharides which contrasted with the weak green fluorescence of the remainder of the section. Hot perchloric acid has been used for the selective extraction of RNA. Other mineral acids and nucleases were found to be unsatisfactory for the selective extraction of nucleic fields because acid mucopolysaccharides were removed at the same time. Mild methods of methylation (using methanolic thionyl chlorine or diazomethane) have been successfully used for both the temporary and permanent blocking of sulphate and other basophilic groups. The normal technique for methylating tissues, using hot methanolic solutions of hydrochloric acid (Fisher and Lillie, 195 U) were found to be unsatisfactory; much of the reactive material was extracted from tissue sections instead of being methylated. Sulphated acid mucopolysaccharides were desulphated to a limited extent by this reagent. Using published methods based upon iron mordants (Hicks and Mathaei, 1958; Hale, 1946), it was found that acid mucopolysaccharides did not always take up ferric ions whereas nucleic acids did. Experimental evidence has been collected to show that the results published previously were fortuitously successful and were not strictly specific. Uronic acids Sections were reduced with lithium aluminium hydride (7 b) to show that the non-fluorescent dye alcian blue had a selective affinity for this group. When sections were stained with coriphosphine, they were first stained with alcian blue so as to quench the potential fluorescence of coriphosphine adsorbed onto acid mucopolysaccharides which otherwise would have been difficult to distinguish from that of nuclei. An intense blue fluorescence and a visible purple colour was observed in sites known to contain uronic acid groups after immersing sections in concentrated sulphuric acid at 60 - 75 Â°. vic-Glycols 1, 2 -glycols were cleaved to "dialdehydes" by periodic acid. Those in neutral mucopolysaccharides and glycogen were oxidised completely within 10 minutes. Those in acid mucopolysaccharide required 24 hours or longer before they were oxidised significantly. The engendered dialdehydes have been conjugated with: solutions of homo- and heterocyclic amines (particularly <b>aminoacridine</b> dyes) containing dissolved sulphur dioxide (pseudo-Schiff reagents). Preliminary blocking with methanolic thionyl chloride of the basophilic substance initially present in tissue sections was essential for the observation of specific staining of the engendered dialdehydes. Protein thiol groups nevertheless still interfered with the specificity of the reaction for glycols. Evidence has been accumulated in favour of the following mechanism for this type of reaction which differs from that suggested by Kasten (1958); the engendered dialdehydes take up sulphur dioxide from the dye solution to form sulphenic acids which subsequently combine with the basic dye in a salt-like linkage. Apart from p-aminosalicylic acid, no potentially fluorescent amine has been found to condense with engendered aldehydes in situ, contrary to what Kasten (1958) conjectured and to the numerous reports of fluorescent anil formation of aldehydes in solution. Recent chemical work (Guthrie and Honeyman 1959) has indicated that hydrazines and hydrazides always react with engendered dialdehydes whereas Schiff-type reagents may not, particularly if the dialdehydes are converted to hemiacetal or hemialdol forms. This fact has been confirmed histochemically: salicyloyl hydrazide formed intensely blue fluorescent complexes reliably and more extensively with engendered dialdehydes than do pseudo-Schiff reagents. Moreover, salicyloyl hydrazides did not form any fluorescent artefacts with protein thiol groups after oxidation in periodic acid (Cf. 9 a). The phenylhydrazones of the dialdehydes formed in situ, unlike those in vitro, did not form formazans except with diazotised aniline in pyrnine. Hydroxyl groups The basophilic properties (towards azure A or coriphosphine) of this group after it had been sulphated were studied. The sulphating efficiencies of various Lewis base complexes of sulphur trioxide were investigated in both acid end basic media. The dioxan-sulphur trioxide dissolved in the weak base dimethylformamide (DMF) or sulphur trioxide dissolved in DMF were very efficient sulphating reagents, even for glycogen which could not be sulphated by acidic sulphating reagents. The amine groups of proteins were sulphated simultaneously by the DMF-sulphur trioxide complex. However, the N-sulphate groups, unlike O- sulphate groups, were easily hydrolysed off by methanolic hydrochloric acid at room temperature. If the amine groups were protected beforehand with suitable blocking reagents, the access of the sulphating complex to hydroxyl groups was completely hindered. Although glycogen in tissue sections can be sulphated normally by sulphuryl chloride vapour, the hydroxyl groups of neutral mucopolysaccharides were not sulphated in the same way: it is Relieved that in the latter, non-basophilic cyclic sulphate groups were formed. Primary hydroxyl groups The selective sulphation and subsequent basophilia (towards azure A or coriphosphine) of this group by the pyridine-sulphur trioxide complex in the DMF was investigated. Lipids Unsaturated lipids were oxidised by peracetic acid to aldehydes and subsequently condensed with salicyloyl hydrazide to form a blue fluorescent hydrazone. Lipids emitted a reddish-pink fluorescence when sections were stained with an acidified solution of protoporphyrin IX. Ketosteroids formed blue fluorescent salicyloyl hydrazones, most of whom, unlike aldehydo -salicyloylhydrazones, were stable towards alkalis. The interfering aldehydes originating from the autooxidation of lipids were blocked with sulphanilic acid. </ol...|$|E
