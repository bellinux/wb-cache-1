5|$|Homer applies {{for a job}} at {{the power}} plant once more, this time marching into Mr. Burns's office and telling him that he will be the perfect employee. Mr. Burns is so {{impressed}} that he hires Homer on the spot. When Homer returns to Marge's house, he discovers from Jacqueline that she has gone into labor and is already at the hospital. He quickly gets there and sees Marge with Selma and an angry Patty, who starts berating him. Fed up with her disrespect, Homer lashes out at Patty and angrily tells Patty (as well {{as the rest of the}} Bouvier family) to start showing him some respect for he has a job, a piece of news that Homer promptly tells Marge before she finally gives birth to Bart. After Homer finishes telling his flashback story, he admits to Bart that he received the greatest gift <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>can</b> have the day Bart was born. At that time, Marge arrives home with the news that she is not pregnant. They are both overjoyed and high-five.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientist}} Tolley {{aimed to}} establish the manpower needed to haul the vessels over the isthmus ridge. Assuming that a trireme soaked with water weighed 38 tons including its trolley, and that <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>can</b> exert a force of 300N {{over an extended period}} of time, the pulling teams—depending on the slope and the surface of the cart track—must have numbered between 112 and 142 people, with a combined exertion of force of 33 to 42kN, or around 3.8 tons weight. Bringing the trolley up to speed may have required as many as 180 men. Assuming a speed of 2km per hour over an estimated length of 6kilometres, the transfer from sea to sea would have taken three hours to complete.|$|E
5|$|The vessels {{have four}} decks, upon {{which there are}} cabins and saloons for merchants. Several of these 'mysria' contain {{cupboards}} and other conveniences; they have doors which can be locked, and keys for their occupiers. (The merchants) take with them their wives and concubines. It often happens that <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>can</b> be in his cabin without others on board realizing it, {{and they do not}} see him until the vessel has arrived in some port. The sailors also have their children in such cabins; and (in some parts of the ship) they sew garden herbs, vegetables, and ginger in wooden tubs. The Commander of such a vessel is a great Emir; when he lands, the archers and the Ethiops (i.e. black slaves, yet in China these men-at-arms would have most likely been Malays) march before him bearing javelins and swords, with drums beating and trumpets blowing. When he arrives at the guesthouse where he is to stay, they set up their lances {{on each side of the}} gate, and mount guard throughout his visit.|$|E

25|$|Today, Orthodox {{and many}} Conservative rabbis {{maintain}} {{the position that}} only <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>can</b> act as a kohen, and that a daughter of a kohen is recognized as a bat kohen only in those very limited ways that {{have been identified in}} the past.

25|$|After {{interviewing}} 31 dogmen {{and attending}} 14 dog fights in the Southern United States, Evans, Gauthier, and Forsyth theorized on what attracts men to dog fights. In their study, Evans, et al., discussed dog fighting's attractiveness {{in terms of}} masculinity and class immobility. In the United States, masculinity embodies the qualities of strength, aggression, competition, and striving for success. By embodying these characteristics, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>can</b> gain honor and status in his society. Yet, working class occupations, unlike middle or upper class occupations, provide limited opportunities to validate this culturally accepted definition of masculinity. So, working class men look for alternative ways to validate their masculinity and obtain honor and status. One {{way to do this}} is through dogfighting. This is supported by the Evans, et al. findings: the majority of committed dogmen were mostly drawn from the working class, while the middle and upper classes were barely represented. Men from middle and upper classes have opportunities to express their masculinity through their occupations; dog fighting, therefore, is just a hobby for them while it plays a central role in the lives of working class men. Those from the higher classes are drawn in by the thrill and excitement of the fight.|$|E

500|$|Overall, {{the episode}} was {{received}} well by critics. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger thought that [...] "The Damage <b>a</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Can</b> Do" [...] had [...] "some major foundational problems", {{but he said}} that both Michael C. Hall and Jimmy Smits' performances were [...] "wonderful". Paste magazine's Jeffrey Bloomer likened the episode simply to pulp and felt that Dexter's voice overs lacked their usual [...] "dry, dark humor and gonzo wisdom". IGN critic Matt Fowler believed that Dexter and Miguel's conversations contained [...] "traces of overly awkward dialogue all over" [...] and that the pairings of Debra and Quinn, and LaGuerta and Ellen were [...] "forced" [...] while Miguel's desire to kill seemed [...] "unnatural". Writing for TV Guide, Paula Paige said that her favorite part of the episode was Dexter's spinning Fleeter on the table like a roulette wheel and also she enjoyed Rita's storyline, calling her a [...] "hormonal hoot". TV Squad's Debra McDuffee thought that Angel and Barbara's romance was [...] "painfully awkward" [...] to watch and Rita's storyline was [...] "lame and stereotypical". The A.V. Club's Scott Tobias believed the episode to be [...] "awesome" [...] and said that he was [...] "more anxious than usual to see what Dexter was up to, and equally anxious {{to get away from the}} peripheral dramas". BuddyTV critic John Kubicek named [...] "The Damage <b>a</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Can</b> Do" [...] the sixty-fourth best television episode of 2008.|$|E
500|$|... "The Damage <b>a</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Can</b> Do" [...] is {{the eighth}} {{episode of the}} third season of the American {{television}} drama series Dexter, which first aired on November 16, 2008 on Showtime in the United States. The episode was written by Scott Buck and directed by Marcos Siega. In the episode, assistant district attorney Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits) asks Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) for his assistance in killing a murderous gambler. Meanwhile, Dexter's sister Ofr. Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter) finds her boyfriend and informant Anton Briggs (David Ramsey) to be missing after she tells him that {{he is no longer}} legally obligated to work for her.|$|E
500|$|The {{novel is}} highly contentious. Controversy {{surrounded}} its {{praise of the}} military and approval of violence, {{to the extent that it}} has frequently been described as fascist, and its implication that militarism is superior to traditional democracy. According to the 2009 Science Fiction Handbook, it had the effect of giving Heinlein a reputation as a [...] "fanatical warmongering fascist". A comparison between a quote in Starship Troopers that [...] "the noblest fate that <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>can</b> endure is to place his own mortal body between his loved home and war's desolation" [...] and the anti-war poem [...] "Dulce et Decorum Est" [...] by Wilfred Owen sparked a two-year debate in the Proceedings of the Institute for Twenty-First Century Studies from 1959 to 1961.|$|E

500|$|The first dent in this {{stability}} {{came about}} in 1607, with the Case of Prohibitions. James VI and I claimed that as monarch, {{he had a}} divine right to sit as a judge and interpret the common law as he saw fit. Led by Sir Edward Coke, the judiciary rejected this idea, stating that while the monarch was not subject to any individual, he was subject to the law. Until he had gained sufficient knowledge of the law, he {{had no right to}} interpret it; Coke pointed out that such knowledge [...] "demanded mastery of an artificial reason... which requires long study and experience, before that <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>can</b> attain to the cognizance of it". Similarly, in the Case of Proclamations in 1611, Coke held that the monarch could only exercise those prerogatives he already had, and not create new ones.|$|E
500|$|... "The Damage <b>a</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Can</b> Do" [...] {{was filmed}} in early October 2008. On playing Harry as {{a figment of}} Dexter's imagination, James Remar told Vanity Fair that [...] "it's {{challenging}} to play a specter in somebody’s current existence." [...] He said: [...] "In my own life, I find myself doing some task [...] and {{having a conversation with}} my mother or father, who are both deceased. [...] I suspect lots of people do it. And when I hold that conversation, different images of my parents appear to me. And so it's my job to do my best to be that image in Dexter's mind." [...] When asked about playing the only character to join Dexter in his [...] "kill room," [...] Jimmy Smits said: [...] "The crew has a great respect for what they are doing in those scenes. They are energized because those moments are the staple of the show, {{but at the same time}} they are very somber. Michael doesn't really like to interface with a lot of people on those days, because it's such a serious subject matter." ...|$|E
500|$|Friday {{was marked}} {{during the game}} by Mark Lawrenson, who so {{frustrated}} the Cardiff forward with his close attention that Friday waited for Lawrenson to attempt a slide tackle and then {{kicked him in the}} face. After receiving a red card, Friday left the ground with the game still going on; according to legend, before leaving he broke into the Brighton dressing room and defecated in Lawrenson's kit bag. Cardiff eventually lost 4–0. [...] "I am sick and tired of it", Andrews told the South Wales Echo on 1 November. [...] "To be sent off in his first game back is as much as <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>can</b> stand". Friday was transfer-listed and served a three-match suspension before making his final appearance on 10 December in Cardiff's 6–3 away defeat against Bolton. Liza was by now the mother of Friday's second daughter, Arabella, but around this time began divorce proceedings. Friday claimed that he had had enough of people telling him what to do, and walked into Andrews's office on 20 December 1977 to announce that he was retiring from professional football. The club promptly released him and cancelled his contract.|$|E
