First, it {{analyses}} the matter of the relations between International Law and National or Domestic law according with the theories dualism and monist and international decisions. Then, it studies the reception and the hierarchy of International Customary and Conventional Law to Domestic Law including Constitution. This matter has been studied according with several Constitutions and the international doctrine. Then, it considers the constitutional regulations about international law in the Constitution of the Republic of Colombia.   The general conclusion is that International Law is incorporated in domestic law according with the Constitution of each country. But every state has the duty to carry out in good faith its obligations <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>treaties</b> and other sources of International Law, and it may not invoke provisions in its Constitutions or its Laws as an excuse for failure to perform this duty.

40|$|The goal of {{the thesis}} is to analyze {{structure}} {{and development of the}} mandatory expenditures in the Czech Republic in the period 1993 - 2013. The theoretical part deals with theories of public expenditures and public revenues in order to explain the importance of the mandatory expenditures in the scheme of Czech public finance. The second section of the theoretical part describes the features and legal framework with regard to the methodology of the Ministry of finance of the Czech Republic. The practical part of the thesis adopts the framework built in the theoretical part of the thesis. The most important expenditures are expenditures arising from law, which represent over 90 % of mandatory expenditures. The social transfers came into scrutiny because of special importance within this group of expenditures. The fastest growing expenditures within non-social transfers were debt-service expenditures caused by irresponsible fiscal policy of the government within the period. The other mandatory expenditures are divided into expenditures arising from other legal regulations, which are negligible, and into expenditures <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>treaties,</b> which are very hard to cut down. The quasi-mandatory expenditures, involing defence spending and wages of employees of the public sector, were analysed in order to build up definition of mandatory expenditures in the broad sense, meaning sum of mandatory and quasi-mandatory expenditures. The last section of practical part of the thesis is devoted to comparing the development of the mandatory expenditures and mandatory expenditures in the broad sense with the development of important macroeconomic indicators, as GDP and inflation and total expenditures and revenues of the government budget. Mandatory expenditures and also mandatory expenditures in broad sense has grown during the whole period, the ratio to public revenues and public expenditures has grown, resulting in decrease of the fiscal democracy of the government and increase of the government debt...|$|E

50|$|Though the European democracies tend {{to support}} broad, universalistic interpretations of {{international}} law, many other democracies have differing views on international law. Several democracies, including India, Israel and the United States, take a flexible, eclectic approach, recognizing aspects of {{public international law}} such as territorial rights as universal, regarding other aspects as <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>treaty</b> or custom, and viewing certain aspects as not being subjects of public international law at all. Democracies in the developing world, due to their past colonial histories, often insist on non-interference in their internal affairs, particularly regarding human rights standards or their peculiar institutions, but often strongly support international law at the bilateral and multilateral levels, {{such as in the}} United Nations, and especially regarding the use of force, disarmament obligations, and the terms of the UN Charter.|$|R

Finally, based on experience with CITES, ICRW and other multilateral environmental treaties, I attempt to design some of the new ICRW compliance mechanism features in order to increase its effectiveness...|$|R
50|$|The Supreme Court of Canada has {{acknowledged}} that there are gaps in the texts of historical numbered treaties. This means that the oral negotiations surrounding treaty negotiations are necessary to fully understand the rights and obligations to which treaties give rise. For example, the Supreme Court of Canada has stated that obligations <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> historical <b>treaties</b> encompass an oral promise that “the same means of earning a livelihood would continue after the treaty as existed before it.” The Court further stated that “a large element of the Treaty 8 negotiations were the assurances of continuity in traditional patterns of economic activity. Continuity respects traditional patterns of activity and occupation.” Therefore, orally negotiated historical treaties give rise to rights go beyond the right to hunt, fish and trap to include a right to maintain its traditional and cultural way of {{life as well as}} their traditional forms of economic activity.|$|R
