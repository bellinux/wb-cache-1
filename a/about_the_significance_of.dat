5|$|The Western Ganga {{administration}} {{was influenced by}} principles stated in the ancient text arthashastra. The praje gavundas mentioned in the Ganga records held responsibilities {{similar to those of}} the village elders (gramavriddhas) mentioned by Kautilya. Succession to the throne was hereditary but there were instances when this was overlooked. The kingdom was divided into Rashtra (district) and further into Visaya (consisting of possibly 1000 villages) and Desa. From the 8th century, the Sanskrit term Visaya was replaced by the Kannada term Nadu. Examples of this change are Sindanadu-8000 and Punnadu-6000, with scholars differing <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> the numerical suffix. They opine that it was either the revenue yield of the division computed in cash terms or the number of fighting men in that division or the number of revenue paying hamlets in that division or the number of villages included in that territory.|$|E

The opposition to these shut-door beliefs was led by Joshua Himes and make up the second post-1844 group. This faction soon gained the upper hand, even converting Miller to their point of view. Their influence was enhanced by the staging of the Albany Conference. The Advent Christian Church has its roots in this post-Great Disappointment group.|$|E

25|$|A further {{breakthrough}} occurred {{upon the}} advent of modern ("ab initio") electronic structure calculations whereby the relevant parameters characterising JT systems can be reliably determined from first principles. Thus one could go beyond studies of model systems that explore the effect of parameter variations on the PES and vibronic energy levels; one could also go on beyond fitting these parameters to experimental data without clear knowledge <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> the fit. Instead, well-founded theoretical investigations became possible which greatly improved the insight into the phenomena at hand and {{into the details of}} the underlying mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|Formation of the {{temporomandibular}} joints {{occurs at}} around 12 weeks in utero when the joint spaces and the articular disc develop. At approximately 10 weeks the {{component of the}} fetus future joint becomes evident in the mesenchyme between condylar cartilage of the mandible and the developing temporal bone. Two slits like joint cavities and intervening disk make their appearance in this region by 12 weeks. The mesenchyme around the joint begins to form the fibrous joint capsule. Very little is known <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> newly forming muscles in joint formation. The developing superior head of the lateral pterygoid muscle attaches to the anterior portion of the fetal disk.

Unknown to Falcone the efforts to kill him were suspended while the Maxi trial verdicts went through the appeals process that had often set convicted Mafia members free.

25|$|Food versus fuel is {{the dilemma}} {{regarding}} {{the risk of}} diverting farmland or crops for biofuels production {{to the detriment of}} the food supply. The biofuel and food price debate involves wide-ranging views, and is a long-standing, controversial one in the literature. There is disagreement <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> the issue, what is causing it, and what can or should be done to remedy the situation. This complexity and uncertainty is due to the large number of impacts and feedback loops that can positively or negatively affect the price system. Moreover, the relative strengths of these positive and negative impacts vary in the short and long terms, and involve delayed effects. The academic side of the debate is also blurred by the use of different economic models and competing forms of statistical analysis.|$|E
25|$|In 1890, Tout left Lampeter {{and became}} Professor of History at Owens College, Manchester, (a {{constituent}} {{college of the}} Victoria University) where he stayed until 1925 (this changed to the University of Manchester in 1903). In 1894 he failed to gain the chair at Glasgow. Tout was, with , {{one of the two}} leading figures of the `Manchester History School' and {{is best known for his}} 6-volume Chapters in the Administrative History of Medieval England, whose influence still remains and was for 40 years magisterial in the shaping of late medieval English History scholarship. Concentrating, through close study of the Crown's administrative records, on how changes of government-method reflected changes in the nature of power and politics, the work stood the test of 19th century constitutional history and mid-20th century socio-political emphasis with very few fundamental criticisms of Tout's methods and conclusions. Other works, which stood the test of time much less well, included The Political History of England, 1216–1377 (1905), and the notoriously unpersuasive The Place of the Reign of Edward II in English History (1914), comprising the Ford Lectures at Oxford University in 1913. Tout published a heavily revised second edition in 1926. Tout was also prolific in writing short, sharp articles <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> particular documents he had found, most of which still stand up impressively. He was president of the Royal Historical Society from 1925 to 1929. He was a Member of the Chetham Society, and served as a Member of Council from 1907 to 1929.|$|E
500|$|Though Hazlitt {{could find}} much to {{appreciate}} in the comedies, tragedy {{was to him}} inherently more important, and he weights the tragedies much more heavily. In this he differed from Johnson, who thought Shakespeare best at comedy. The greatest of the plays were tragedies—particularly Macbeth, Othello, King Lear, and Hamlet—and Hazlitt's comments on tragedy are often integrated with his ideas <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> poetry and imaginative literature in general. As he expressed {{it at the end}} of [...] "Lear", tragedy describes the strongest passions, and [...] "the greatest strength of genius is shewn here in describing the strongest passions: for the power of the imagination, in works of invention, must be in proportion to the force of the natural impressions, which are the subject of them." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Isaac Hempstead-Wright, who portrays Bran Stark in the series, Wright was asked <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> Bran witnessing {{the scene at the}} Tower of Joy, saying [...] "I don't think Bran knows why this is significant, but he knows that it is significant because he wouldn't have seen it if it wasn't earth-shattering, because everything we've learned so far during his visions has been pretty big and important, from the creation of the first White Walker to the origins of Hodor. This is clearly another important milestone in the history of Westeros. For Bran, he sat there sitting, 'This isn't my brother. This is my cousin somehow, but who's the dad? And why have I been shown this? If I find out who the dad is and why I need to know who the dad is, then let Jon know quick.'" [...] The scene reveals neither Lyanna Stark's son's name nor his father's, with the transition between the newborn's face and Jon Snow's visually conveying the identity. HBO released an infographic shortly after the episode aired, confirming Ned Stark as Jon's guardian, and Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen as his parents.|$|E
500|$|The Marble Index was {{produced}} during a little-studied period of Nico's life. For The Quietuss Matthew Lindsay, [...] "the liminal drift {{of these years}} only emphasizes the music's amorphous moorings and lack of precedent." [...] Nico approached Danny Fields around the summer of 1968 {{with the desire to}} make an album and prove herself artistically. Resentful of her beauty, she radically changed her image – dyeing her hair red and wearing black clothes in an effort to distance herself from what had made her a popular fashion model. John Cale said, [...] "She hated the idea of being blonde and beautiful, and in some ways she hated being a woman, because she figured all her beauty had brought her was grief... So The Marble Index was an opportunity for her to prove she was a serious artist, not just this kind of blonde bombshell." [...] Nico already had the title for the album in mind from The Prelude, William Wordsworth's magnum opus; in it, he contemplates a statue of Isaac Newton [...] "with his prism and silent face / The marble index of a mind for ever / Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone." [...] Asked <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> this Wordsworth quote, Nico replied: [...] "I sometimes find a little of my own poetry in other poets, yes. Incidentally, or accidentally." ...|$|E
500|$|At one point, the {{principal}} male characters congregate {{in an alley}} behind Johnny's apartment to play catch with a football while wearing tuxedos. When Mark arrives, he is revealed to have shaved his beard, and the camera slowly zooms in on his face while dramatic music plays on the soundtrack. Nothing that is said or occurs during the scene has any effect on the plot; the scene ends abruptly when the men decide to return to Johnny's apartment after Peter trips. Wiseau received enough questions about the scene {{that he decided to}} address it on a Q segment featured on the DVD release; rather than explaining the scene, though, Wiseau only states that playing football without the proper protective equipment is fun and challenging. Greg Sestero has been questioned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> Mark's shaving, though his only response for several years was [...] "if people only knew." [...] Sestero describes in The Disaster Artist that Wiseau insisted he shave his beard on-set just so that Wiseau would have an excuse for Johnny to call Mark [...] "Babyface," [...] Wiseau's own nickname for Sestero, and that the revealing of beardless Mark would be [...] "a moment". Sestero further detailed how the football-in-tuxedos scene was concocted on set by Wiseau, who never explained the significance of the scene to the cast or crew and insisted that the sequence be filmed at the expense of other, relevant scenes.|$|E

[...] Before he did so, Eisenhower was cheered for several minutes as the crowd chanted [...] "We Like Ike!" [...] Following a 12-minute speech, Eisenhower unveiled the statue, calling Shevchenko a Ukrainian hero and stated: [...] "For {{my hope is that}} your magnificent march from the shadow of the Washington Monument {{to the foot of the}} statue of Shevchenko will here kindle a new world movement in the hearts, minds, words and actions of men; a never-ending movement dedicated to the independence and freedom of peoples of all captive nations of the entire world." [...] He also said the statue represented [...] "millions of oppressed" [...] in Eastern Europe and [...] "gives them constant encouragement to struggle forever against Communist tyranny, until, one day final victory is achieved, as it most surely will be." [...] Following the unveiling, the Ukrainian Choral Societies of America led the crowd in a musical rendition of Shevchenko's poem [...] [...] Additional speeches were then made by several U.S. Representatives and Archbishop Ioan Theodorovych of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church gave the benediction. [...] The ceremony concluded with the crowd singing Ukraine's national anthem, Shche ne vmerla Ukraina (English: Ukraine Has Not Yet Died).|$|E
500|$|Although {{the film}} {{generally}} remains true {{to the original}} novels, several scenes and characters were removed or merged with others to bring the script to a reasonable length. [...] Noting that [...] "there wasn't time for everything", the producers cut completely {{the scene in the}} Temple of Bel-Shamharoth and the associated plotline <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> the number eight; Director Vadim Jean defended the decision, saying [...] "we could have gone there, but we went to the Wyrmberg instead. There [...] time constraints and we could have gone one way or the other, so we went the whole hog on just one." [...] The scenes in the Wyrmberg were themselves shortened and simplified, reducing the character of Li!ort to a cameo and losing the characters of K!sdra, Greicha and Hrun completely. [...] The inter-wizard rivalry at Unseen University, by contrast, was expanded and spread out throughout the film, while in the novels the sequences are short and mainly found in The Light Fantastic. [...] This established Trymon as a more easily recognisable antagonist. To avoid the necessity of explaining the deus ex machina in detail, the Octavo in the film simply causes A'Tuin to roll to recapture Rincewind, whereas in the novel, a complicated 'change spell' returns him to the disc. [...] The creatures from the Dungeon Dimensions which invade reality at the end of The Light Fantastic, and Rincewind's fight in the Dungeon Dimensions themselves, are completely omitted, and Trymon is simply driven mad by reading the Octavo spells {{at the end of the}} film version. Galder Weatherwax is also killed by Trymon in the film version, whereas, in the books, he is killed by accidentally summoning the Luggage instead of Rincewind.|$|E
