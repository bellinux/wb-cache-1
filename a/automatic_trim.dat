50|$|The firm Glasflügel (glass wings) {{was founded}} by Eugen Hänle in 1962 and was located in Schlattstall, south of Kirchheim unter Teck. It was the first firm to {{manufacture}} a glass-fibre sailplane in large numbers.

40|$|A {{knowledge}} base about any domain should satisfy some basic properties. One of these properties is completeness. Assuming that a {{knowledge base}} is temporal, that is, it contains explicit time references in its rules and facts, we may face {{a problem of}} {{an infinite number of}} possible premises, as the number of temporal references (e. g. in business documents) is unlimited. A technique for reducing the number of possible rules in a temporal knowledge base is proposed in this paper. This is achieved by transforming an infinite set of possible temporal rules into a finite one by mapping an infinite set of temporal references onto a finite set, and by <b>automatic</b> <b>trimming</b> of idiomatic phrases read from business documents.

50|$|The Z-50L is a {{cantilever}} low-winged single-engined monoplane with a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. Unlike the Zlín Z 26 series {{which it}} replaced, the Z-50 was of all-metal construction, with limit maneuvering load factors of +9.0 and -6.0. It does not incorporate landing flaps; in their place, two-section ailerons extend the full wingspan, providing an exceptional rate of roll. The designers made ample provision for trimming: <b>automatic</b> <b>trim</b> tabs are {{used on the}} inboard aileron sections; {{on one of the}} elevators and on the fabric-covered rudder; one outboard aileron has a ground-adjustable trim tab; the elevator has a trim tab which can be adjusted in-flight.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{algorithm}} {{based on a}} quasi-monolithic approach to solve strongly coupled fluid-structure interaction problems. This approach is an implicit coupling adapted to a partitioned solver while conserving the property of convergence and stability of the monolithic approach. The coupling is done between a finite element program ARA developed by K-Epsilon and the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes code, ISIS-CFD, part of the commercial software FINE/Marine. The fluid mesh is deformed using a fast, robust and parallelized method which propagates the deformation state. The mesh deformation is taken into account through the ALE method. Validation of the coupling was performed against the experimental results of a flapping membrane. Application of the coupling is made to compare the unsteady flying stability of two downwind sails using an <b>automatic</b> <b>trimming</b> algorithm.

Details are given {{of the application}} of TSIM {{to the analysis of}} aeroelastic systems under the RAE Farborough extension FLEX-SIM. The aerodynamic and structural data for the equations of motion of a flexible aircraft are prepared by a preprocessor program for incorporation in TSIM simulations. Within the simulation, the flexible aircraft model may then be selected interactively for different flight conditions and modal reduction techniques applied. The use of FLEX-SIM is demonstrated by an example of the flutter prediction for a simple aeroelastic model. By utilizing the numerical optimization facility of TSIM, it is possible to undertake identification of required parameters in the TSIM model within the simulation...|$|R

50|$|The low-set, {{straight}} wing has a double-taper planform, 2½-deg dihedral {{from the}} roots, {{a relatively low}} aspect ratio, and 100 L fuel tanks permanently attached to the wingtips. The trailing edge has double-slotted trailing edge flaps inboard of mass-balanced ailerons; the flaps are separated from the ailerons by small wing fences. An <b>automatic</b> <b>trimming</b> system was present, the flaps and the trim system being connected in order to counteract the potentially large pitch changes {{that would otherwise be}} generated by vigorous movements of the flaps. The tall, swept vertical tail has an inset rudder. Variable-incidence horizontal stabilizers with inset elevators are mounted {{at the base of the}} rudder and over the exhaust nozzle. Side-by-side airbrakes are located under the fuselage ahead of the wing's leading edge. The flaps, landing gear, wheel brakes and air brakes are powered by a hydraulic system.

40|$|Linear {{discriminant}} analysis (LDA) is a multivariate statistical technique {{used to determine}} which continuous variables discriminate between two or more naturally occurring groups. This technique creates a linear discriminant function that yields optimal classification rule between two or more groups under the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity. Nonetheless, the computation of parametric LDA {{which are based on}} the sample mean vectors and pooled sample covariance matrix are known to be sensitive to nonnormality. To overcome the sensitivity of this method towards non-normality as well as homoscedasticity, this study proposed a new robust LDA method. Through this approach, an <b>automatic</b> <b>trimmed</b> mean vector was used as a substitute for the usual mean vector in the parametric LDA. Meanwhile, for the covariance matrix, this study introduced a robust approach by multiplying the Spearman’s rho with the corresponding robust scale estimator used in the trimming process.

40|$|In this thesis, an {{architecture}} for the adaptive mode transition control of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) is presented. The proposed architecture {{consists of three}} levels: the highest level is occupied by mission planning routines where information about way points the vehicle must follow is processed. The middle level uses a trajectory generation component to coordinate the task execution and provides set points for low-level stabilizing controllers. The adaptive mode transitioning control algorithm resides at {{the lowest level of}} the hierarchy consisting of a mode transitioning controller and the accompanying adaptation mechanism. The mode transition controller is composed of a mode transition manager, a set of local controllers, a set of active control models, a set point filter, a state filter, an <b>automatic</b> <b>trimming</b> mechanism and a dynamic compensation filter. Local controllers operate in local modes and active control models operate in transitions between two local modes. The mode transition manager determines the actual mode of operation of the vehicle based on a set of mode membership functions and activates a local controller or an active control model accordingly. The adaptation mechanism uses an indirect adaptive control methodology to adapt the active control models. For this purpose, a set of plant models based on fuzzy neural networks is trained based on input/output information from the vehicle and used to compute sensitivity matrices providing the linearized models required by the adaptation algorithms. The effectiveness of the approach is verified through software-in-the-loop simulations, hardware-in-the-loop simulations and flight testing. Ph. D.
