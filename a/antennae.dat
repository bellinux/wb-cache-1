5|$|Before mating, {{males and}} females may stridulate, or vibrate the objects they are on. In the Meloidae, the male climbs onto the dorsum of the female and strokes his <b>antennae</b> on her head, palps, and <b>antennae.</b> In Eupompha, the male draws his <b>antennae</b> along his {{longitudinal}} vertex. They may not mate at all {{if they do not}} perform the precopulatory ritual. This mating behaviour may be different amongst dispersed populations of the same species. For example, the mating of a Russian population of tansy beetle (Chysolina graminis) is preceded by an elaborate ritual involving the male tapping the female's eyes, pronotum and <b>antennae</b> with its <b>antennae,</b> which is not evident in the population of this species in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Beetle <b>antennae</b> are {{primarily}} organs of sensory perception and can detect motion, odour and chemical substances, {{but may also}} be used to physically feel a beetle's environment. Beetle families may use <b>antennae</b> in different ways. For example, when moving quickly, tiger beetles {{may not be able to}} see very well and instead hold their <b>antennae</b> rigidly in front of them in order to avoid obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Diptera were {{traditionally}} {{broken down}} into two suborders, Nematocera and Brachycera, distinguished by the differences in <b>antennae.</b> The Nematocera are recognized by their elongated bodies and many-segmented, often feathery <b>antennae</b> as represented by mosquitoes and crane flies. The Brachycera have rounder bodies and much shorter <b>antennae.</b> Subsequent studies have identified the Nematocera as being non-monophyletic with modern phylogenies placing the Brachycera within grades of groups formerly placed in the Nematocera.

5|$|Following a {{suggestion}} of , the <b>antennae</b> of the Submillimeter Array, a radio-wave astronomical observatory on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, are arranged on four nested Reuleaux triangles. Placing the <b>antennae</b> on a curve of constant width causes the observatory {{to have the same}} spatial resolution in all directions, and provides a circular observation beam. As the most asymmetric curve of constant width, the Reuleaux triangle leads to the most uniform coverage of the plane for the Fourier transform of the signal from the array. The <b>antennae</b> may be moved from one Reuleaux triangle to another for different observations, according to the desired angular resolution of each observation. The precise placement of the <b>antennae</b> on these Reuleaux triangles was optimized using a neural network. In some places the constructed observatory departs from the preferred Reuleaux triangle shape because that shape was not possible within the given site.|$|E

5|$|Caprellamutica are {{omnivorous}} highly adaptable opportunistic feeders.

They are predominantly detritivores, but have the remarkable ability of adjusting feeding methods from being grazers, scavengers, filter feeders, and even predators depending on the conditions of their environments. C.mutica sieve food particles or small organisms from the water by waving their bodies back and forth, with the comb-like setae on their second pair of <b>antennae</b> extended. They then clean off trapped particles by bending their <b>antennae</b> down to their mouthparts. They also use their <b>antennae</b> to scrape food particles from surfaces of their bodies or the substrate that they are clinging to. The large gnathopods are used for striking at and grasping both mobile and sessile prey. Known prey organisms of C.mutica include algae (both planktonic and macroalgae), dinoflagellates, hydrozoans, bryozoans, diatoms, copepods, brine shrimps, and other amphipods.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{the basic}} design of an {{adaptive}} {{ground penetrating radar}} <b>antenna</b> is introduced. The <b>antenna</b> is able to adapt its input impedance to {{a variation in the}} <b>antenna</b> elevation and soil type to keep reflections at the <b>antenna’s</b> terminal min-imum. As a result, energy transfer from the generator to the an-tenna is maximized, which in turn maximizes the energy radiated by the <b>antenna</b> into the ground for different <b>antenna</b> elevations and soil types. The <b>antenna</b> is based on a wire bow-tie structure with variable flare angle for adjusting the <b>antenna’s</b> input impedance. The flare angle variation is realized by short-circuiting the gaps separating the wires from the feed point of the <b>antenna,</b> for which electronic switching devices such as PIN diodes could be used to allow fast and convenient control of the <b>antenna’s</b> flare angle.
