In experiments [Nedelec et al. Nature, 389, 305 (1997); Surrey et al., Science, 292, 1167 (2001) ] performed in a quasi-two-dimensional confined geometry, microtubules are oriented by complexes of motor proteins. This interaction yields a variety of patterns, including <b>arangements</b> of asters, vortices and disordered configurations. We model this system via a two-dimensional vector field describing the local coarse-grained microtubule orientation and two scalar density fields associated to molecular motors. These scalar fields describe motors which either attach to and move along microtubules or diffuse freely within the solvent. Transitions between single aster, spiral and vortex states are obtained {{as a consequence of}} confinement, as parameters in our model are varied. We also obtain other novel states, including ``outward asters'', distorted vortices and lattices of asters on confined systems. We calculate the steady state distribution of bound and free motors in aster and vortex configurations of microtubules and compare these to our simulation results, providing qualitative arguments for the stability of different patterns in various regimes of parameter space. We also study the role of crowding or ``saturation'' effects on the density profiles of motors in asters, discussing the role of such effects in stabilizing single asters.

3000|$|Training of milk {{handlers}} {{has always}} been advocated {{as a way of}} improving milk quality (GOK 2010). In this study, results of microbial counts in milk at the secondary collection centre indicated that {{there was no significant difference}} in microbial load of milk handled by individuals trained on milk quality vis a vis those without training. It was also observed that the milk handling practices of individuals trained on milk quality were not different from those without training. Training of milk handlers along the chain while neglecting milk handlers at production does not result in reduced microbial load. This is because milk contamination begins at production and the microbial load increases exponentially along the chain due to lack of a cold chain, inappropriate milk containers and non-observance of good hygienic practices. Training should enable the milk handlers and actors along the value chain to adhere to a set of Standard Operating Procedures that limit microbial growth. It was also observed that milk containers are labeled by owners, and even after the milk is bulked for cooling, it is returned to the same containers for transport to Nairobi city. These activities create congestion and excessive handling of the milk at the collectoin centre where everybody wants to track their milk (or containers). The actors at the collection centres therefore not only need training on milk quality but also support to strengthen institutional capacites of the collecton centres so that operations are left to elected directors and trained employees.

40|$|The words 'sacred' and 'profane' aren't used {{in their}} {{customary}} meaning in this lecture. The nearest interpretation of our explanation is in {{the first chapter of}} Mircea Eliade's Sacred and Profane titled 'Sacred is manifesting'. The title of this article had been chosen to regard comprehensively Eliade's book for this reason. In this lecture we would like to consider the symbolism of decorated, ornamented, structured surfaces of architectural - or nearly architectural - phenomena. We would like to analyse just as the everytime/everywhere cosmic ordination, n the universal <b>arangement</b> of these - manifested itself according to the everytime/everywhere cosmic meaning. The everytime/everywhere architectural phenomenon oversteps itself. Beyond the satisfaction of practical and average requirements it has communicated by discoverable messages of cultural and civilisational codes about the world. The everywhere architecture is a 'paradoxical medium'. We have to develop an intellectual relationship with it in addition to what we see about, or how we use it in space or appropriateness. The quality of architecture gets meaning - will be manifested - in an interpretational context. We just have to catch it - to interpretate for ourself - in a conceivable space, and appropriateness to arrive at close to its substance. Eliade says: 'We couldn't emphasize enough that every hierophania (manifestation of the sacred) - even the most elemental - is a paradoxon'. (…) A sacred stone more over is a stone (from a profane point of view). It is not different from all of the other stones at all. Though, every other people for whom this stone has manifested as a sacred stone, the direct reality had been converted into supernatural reality. Those people who had religious experiences, the whole nature manifested as a cosmic sacrament. In such case the whole cosmos will be a hierophan. ' Well, we would like to present - by some examples - that progress, as the cosmic ordination is manifested by the architectural phenomena. This ordination is a canonic one - it's structured by the everytime/everywhere cosmic comprehension, and itís aranged by discoverable principles, and as such being is a super-existent one, over the average peopleís profane aspect. Its manifestation could be interpretated in a conceivable space and appropriateness. The understanding of these manifestations - independently of either sacral or secular explanations - needs spiritual efforts. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} the pattern forming {{processes}} {{in three different}} semiconductor systems will be discussed. The first example is the current transport through a semiconductor heterostructure showing an s-shaped current voltage characteristic. The charge transport through the device is modelled by a hydrodynamic approach and the resulting partial differential equations fall into the class of reaction-diffusion systems. Depending {{on the structure of}} the contacts the equations may be globally or diffusively coupled. In the globally coupled equations three different types of stationary and a number of oscillating, spatially inhomogenous patterns can be found. In contrast to that the diffusively coupled equations only show three different types of stationary, spatially inhomogenous patterns and in a small regime of parameter space bistability between homogeneous oscillations and stationary stuctures. The second example is the initial stage of growth of self-organised quantum dots which can be observed in hetero-epitaxy of materials with different lattice constants. The strain which is present in this type of systems {{plays an important role in}} the formation of quantum dots. To model the initial stage of growth strain effects are included into a standard kinetic Monte Carlo scheme leading to a suppression of Ostwald ripening and to a cooperative growth mode. This growth mode is necessary for a sharp size distribution of quantum dots. It will be shown under what conditions not only good ordering in size but also regular spatial <b>arangement</b> of the quntum dots can be acchieved. The influence of growth temperature, growth rate, coverage and growth interruption on the surface structure and the quality of the quantum dots will be discussed. The third example is the atomic surface structure of InP(001) -(2 $ imes$ 4). For different proposed structural models of the surface the reflectance anisotropy spectrum is calculated. The necessary electronic eigenvalues and eigenstates are calculated within a tight-binding scheme. By comparison to experimental data and other theoretical approaches it will be possible to find out about the atomic surface structure of InP(001) -(2 $ imes$ 4) one can see in experiments. It will also be discussed which optical transitions are responsible for the structures which can be found in experimental reflectance anisotropy spectra of InP(001) -(2 $ imes$ 4). Finally the patterns found in charge tranport and during the formation of quantum dots will be compared. The influence of the underlying atomic structure, e. g., the results of the third example, on pattern forming processes in the first two examples will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|COLLECTIVE SECURITY IN POST-COLD WAR EUROPE? The {{main purpose}} of the thesis is to assess whether some kind of {{collective}} security <b>arangement</b> is relevant to the post- cold war security order in Europe. The vast body of recent literature making a case either for or against "collective security" (CS) in post-cold war Europe suggests {{that the concept of}} CS lends itself to different interpretations. By taking a state-centric and military oriented approach to security, chapter 2 presents the classical, universal notion of CS as a conceptual basis for analysis. As the unit of analysis is less than universial, chapter 3 introduces a typology of modified CS systembs. These "systems" are, nevertheless, consistent with the state-centric, "all for one and one for all" approach characterizing the ideal version. The modified versions are dubbed regional CS, concert-based CS, and hybrid CS. Regional CS is essentially a territorially delimited version of the universal model. It is argued that such a system has the potential of being exploited by regional hemons. Concert-based CS shares many of the features of the 19 th century Concert of Europe and is a system that is more consistent with power realities. A hybrid CS system has a dual character as it is a regional CS system as well as a collective self-defence organization. Chapter 4 discusses the main mechanisms of CS, and explores factors that influence their effectiveness when applied within a modifies CS setting. It is argued that the main mechamisms of CS are the deterrent effect of overwhelming military and non-military sanctions, as well as the compulsive effect of collective resistance to aggression. The lenghty discussion in chapter 5 reflects the notion that Europe is undergoing a process of dramatic change whose outcome is impossible to predict. Thus, this thesis has taken an approach towards the "issue of Europe" that opens for several outcomes, and evaluated the relevance of Collective Security to various pøausible post-cold war scenarios. Hence, chapter 5 pulls the strings together and discusses the relevance and feasibility of the CS systems and mechanisms within 5 different interpretations of the "European security complex": 1) Europe as the European Community (basically Western Europe); 2) Europe from Poland to Portugal (non-superpower Europe); 3) Atlanticist Europe (NATO Europe); 4) Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals (Gaullist Europe or Gorbachev's Common European House), and; 5) Europe from Vancouver to Vladivostock (CSCE Europe). The different interpretations are accompanied by judgements about plausible scenarios. Needless to say, the "pictures" of post-cold war Europe are painted with a very wide brush. However, relying on Neoliberal Institutionalist scenarios and propositions concering states' propensity to cooperate, it is argued that Collective Security is relevant with respect to three interpretations of the European security complex (2, 4 and 5). However, (Neo) Realist propositions pertaining to the effects of the uneven distribution of capabilities across states, suggest that CS may not be feasible unless the system respects power realities (as in the concert-based system), or allows for collective balancing against threats stemming from non-members (as in Hybrid CS). Chapter 6 provides concluding remarks. It is asserted that it seems to be common to think that the solution to Europe's quest for å post-cold war security order is a matter of finding the right balance between institutions like the EC, NATO, CSCE, WEU, NACC and so forth. However, as Robert Keohane has argued: "Institutions do not mandate what governments pursue their own interests through cooperation". Thus, the fact that former adversaries now convene in institutions like the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC) may have a far greater value than realist scepticicm would suggest...|$|E
40|$|The final curtain {{has not yet}} {{fallen on}} the East-West {{conflict}} in the Korean peninsula. The heavily armed forces of North and South Korea are still at a stand-off, with almost two million soldiers, supported by 37, 000 US troops on the South Korean side. Since {{the end of the}} Korean War in 1953, which led to the partition of Korea, both countries find themselves technically still at war. So far, there has merely been a cease-fire in force. While South Korea has since developed into a stable democracy {{and one of the most}} economically advanced nations in Asia, the Stalinist rule in the DPRK (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) is threatening to disintegrate. The economic situation there deteriorated drastically during the 1990 s due to economic mismanagement and a number of natural disasters. Despite this worsening economic plight, North Korea possesses the world’s fifth largest army, with almost 1. 2 million soldiers, and spends 25 - 33 % of its GNP on military defence (South Korea spends approx. 3 %). This fuels the fear that the Communist regime in the DPRK could very soon collapse. Given the degree to which both sides are heavily armed and the conflicting structures of their social systems, the danger inherent in this is that such a process of transformation could provoke military conflict. In response to this, South Korean President Kim Daejung launched his Sunshine Policy in 1998 inspired by the European policy of détente. For one thing he is seeking to support the forces for economic reform in Pyongyang with economic aid and reduce the cost of reunifying Korea. For another he is trying to set in motion a process of military confidence building and arms control, so as to create a more stable framework in terms of security policy for the forthcoming transition period. It should make it easier to relieve military tensions and reinforce war prevention. This policy was consistently supported by the US government under President Clinton. In parallel to North Korean-American rapprochement in limiting long-range missiles, great progress was made in 2000 when North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and Kim Daejung met for the first time in Pyongyang, followed shortly afterwards by a meeting of both defence ministers in South Korea. The first family reunions since the war were arranged, economic and food aid was increased and plans were made to reopen a cross-border road and rail link. The beginning of bilateral military confidence building was also agreed on a general level. However, this process came to a standstill when US President Bush entered the White House. He was not willing to take over the results of negotiations to date under the Clinton government and ordered a thorough review of the North Korea policy. In spite of the new “comprehensive approach” announced in summer 2001 there is still no consensus in the American administration between the powers in the State Department, National Security Council and Democratic Party willing to engage in dialogue on the one side, and the conservative unilateralists in the Department of Defense, the White House, National Security Council, State Department’s Arms Control Agency and the Republican Party on II the other. The term “axis of evil” used by Bush in his State of the Union Address on 29 January 2002 to describe the three countries Iraq, Iran and North Korea once again illustrated this vividly. The hard-liners were more interested in a confrontation with North Korea, so as to justify their armament measures and in particular their missile defence programme, as well as unilaterally terminate the ABM Treaty, rather than in a dialogue. They have to date blocked any further progress in the South Korean policy of détente. Against this backdrop this report investigates two key issues. On the political level, clarification is needed of how the conservative unilateralists in the United States will allow themselves to become involved in a dialogue-based approach and whether Pyongyang will then be prepared to accept this approach to negotiation, or whether a prolonged period of confrontation is set to break out. On the level of arms control policy the report examines the tools with which the process of military confidence building can be initiated in spite of the existing military differences and the prevailing level of deep mistrust. On the political level, after US President Bush’s trip to Asia in mid February 2002, in which the American president invited North Korea to engage in dialogue at the highest level and asked China for its support, and especially after the visit of Kim Dae-jung’s personal foreign policy adviser to Pyongyang in April, the dialogue-based approach finally appears to be going ahead. At the end of April 2002 Pyongyang declared itself willing to reopen dialogue. Care is called for, however, as Bush at the same time expressed his continuing scepticism with regard to the North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and his criticism of North Korea’s system of rule during his visit to Asia. In so doing, the credibility of his offer of dialogue was cast into doubt for the time being. Nonetheless the new US government and the South Korean president have agreed on initial topics (nuclear weapons of mass destruction and missiles) for discussion with Pyongyang. Differences in opinion persist with regard to many details however. With the agreement over initial joint topics Kim Dae-jung had begun to involve American unilateralists in the dialogue-based approach, and had bought North Korea a way out of the “axis of evil”. The North Korean willingness to engage in dialogue forced the hard-liners and supporters of dialogue in Washington finally to come to an agreement about a joint but obviously still very contentious “flexible” strategy for dialogue. Kim Dae-jung remains in office only until February 2003, and Washington already appears to be waiting for this change in president. The conservative Grand National Party opposition leader, Lee Hoi-chang, currently has the greatest prospects, beside Roh Moohyun of the Millennium Democratic Party, of winning the presidential elections. He is much closer to the opinions in the Bush government than the present holder of this office, and it should be easier to reach an agreement over the details of a future offer of talks to North Korea with him. Significant progress seems unlikely until then. Since that may substantially increase the costs of cooperation for the DPRK, the North Korean government is attempting on the one hand to intensify its contacts with conservative forces in South Korea. On the other, it is trying at the same time to back the III election of the presidential candidate Roh Moo-hyun, who supports the continuation of the Sunshine Policy, by re-entering into the inter-Korean dialogue. It continues to remain open whether the political leadership there will for its part wait for the outcome of the next presidential elections in the USA at the end of 2004. Notwithstanding, the future of the North Korean moratorium on missile testing is to be decided in 2003, and closely linked to this the hesitations that have meanwhile crept in over the construction of two light-water reactors in North Korea are to be newly regulated at KEDO (Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organisation). The outcome of the mid-term elections to the US Congress due to take place at the end of this year as well as the continued action by the US government against Iraq and Iran will have a lasting effect on North Korean foreign policy. As far as the European Union is concerned during this transition period, the important thing is to continue to offer sustained support to the forces in the US government willing to engage in dialogue and the détente politicians in Seoul, to help the dialogue make a political break-through. The EU is helped in this by the fact that Japan, China, Russia and many other countries in North-east Asia are likewise backing the dialogue-based approach. The European Commission has already successfully encouraged Pyongyang to exercise restraint in the past and therefore strengthened the pragmatics in Washington and the position of the détente politicians in Seoul. Support for economic reformers in North Korea may furthermore improve the internal political requirements there for cooperation with western countries. At the same time Europe should lend its support in Pyongyang to the fact that within the framework of humanitarian dialogue Kim Jong-il is drawing closer to the South Korean détente politicians, especially on the issue of family reunions so important to domestic policy. It must however gently be made clear to the North Korean government that a return to the Clinton government’s policy is a pipe-dream. Pyongyang will pay a higher price for reopening the dialogue with Washington. This will be especially true if Bush is elected for a second term in office at the end of 2004. Brussels can make it easier to accept dialogue by offering additional economic incentives. Since China and Russia also harbour considerable interest in economic reforms in the DPRK, it would remain to be seen whether the EU cooperates better with these countries and comes to an <b>arangement.</b> The rail links through North Korea backed by Beijing and Moscow also suit European trade interests at the end of the day. Japan should likewise take part in this dialogue on economic policy. Germany, which maintains good relations with North and South Korea, is able to lend its permanent support to an improvement in relations since it opened diplomatic relations with Pyongyang in March last year. Both Koreas are not only pursuing economic interests but also aim to learn from the reunification of Germany, even if their motivation is different. Unlike Washington, Berlin has no power ambitions in Korea and can therefore much more credibly offer its services to both sides. The bilateral process of passing on information about military confidence building with North and South Korea that has been set in motion in the interim should definitely be continued. It offers the chance of a trilateral discussion process, or can at least offer it background support. Unlike large IV sections of the Bush administration, German foreign policy backs cooperation and not confrontation. Military confidence building and arms control measures will get another chance only once a stable and permanent dialogue has been reopened between the USA and North Korea. On the level of arms control a plea will be made first of all for confidence and security building measures (CSBMs), as these can be implemented independently of differences in social systems, military doctrines and military capacities, observing the principle of reciprocity. Transparency will constitute the main problem here for North Korea because of their system. To make it easier for the forces in the DPRK to accept transparency, reciprocal and voluntary measures will be approved initially for exchanging information, announcing manoeuvres, inviting observers to manoeuvres and setting up an operational hotline between both defence ministries. The USA should participate in this from the outset. For this reason Pyongyang will have to acknowledge the presence of American forces in South Korea in some way, otherwise they will not be able to be integrated into the CSBMs. The interest of the North Korean army in confidence building measures may grow, as the military superiority of the USA continues to increase...|$|E
