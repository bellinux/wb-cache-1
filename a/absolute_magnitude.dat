5|$|Relative to both {{luminosity}} {{and distance}} from Earth, a star's <b>absolute</b> <b>magnitude</b> (M) and apparent magnitude (m) are not equivalent; for example, the bright star Sirius has an apparent magnitude of −1.44, {{but it has}} an <b>absolute</b> <b>magnitude</b> of +1.41.|$|E
5|$|By {{matching}} {{up these}} curves on the HR diagram the <b>absolute</b> <b>magnitude</b> of main-sequence {{stars in the}} cluster can also be determined.

5|$|As an A-type main {{sequence}} star, Beta Pictoris is more luminous than the Sun: combining the apparent magnitude of 3.861 with {{the distance of}} 19.44 parsecs gives an <b>absolute</b> <b>magnitude</b> of 2.42, {{as compared to the}} Sun, which has an <b>absolute</b> <b>magnitude</b> of 4.83. This corresponds to a visual luminosity 9.2 times greater than that of the Sun. When the entire spectrum of radiation from Beta Pictoris and the Sun is taken into account, Beta Pictoris is found to be 8.7 times more luminous than the Sun.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, the bolometric {{correction}} {{can be made}} to <b>absolute</b> <b>magnitudes</b> {{based on}} other wavelength bands beyond the visible electromagnetic spectrum.

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{determination}} of <b>absolute</b> <b>magnitudes</b> {{for the red}} clump (RC) stars with the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). We used recently reduced parallaxes taken from the Hipparcos catalogue and identified 3889 RC stars with the WISE photometry in the Solar neighbourhood. Mode values estimated from the distributions of <b>absolute</b> <b>magnitudes</b> and a colour of the RC stars in WISE photometry are M_{W 1 }=- 1. 635 (0. 026), M_{W 3 }=- 1. 606 (0. 024) and (W 1 -W 3) _ 0 =- 0. 028 (0. 001) mag.

40|$|International audienceLuminous FG supergiants {{can be used}} as extragalactic {{distance}} indicators. In {{order to}} fully exploit the properties of these bright stars, we must first learn how to measure their luminosities. Based primarily on classical Cepheids and supergiants in clusters and OB associations, we have derived 80 empirical relations connecting the line depth ratios of FeII/FeI lines with the <b>absolute</b> <b>magnitudes</b> Mv and the effective temperatures Teff. These relations have been applied to estimate the <b>absolute</b> <b>magnitudes</b> of 98 FG supergiants with an error of +/- 0. 26 mag.

5|$|The Sun has an {{apparent}} magnitude of −26.7, but its <b>absolute</b> <b>magnitude</b> is only +4.83.

Despite Canopus being vastly more luminous than Sirius, however, Sirius appears brighter than Canopus. This is because Sirius is merely 8.6 light-years from the Earth, while Canopus is much farther away at a distance of 310 light-years.|$|E

40|$|Accepted for {{publication}} in the Astrophysical Journal We describe an accurate new method for determining <b>absolute</b> <b>magnitudes,</b> and hence also K-corrections, which is simpler than most previous methods, being based on a quadratic function of just one suitably chosen observed color. The method relies on the extensive and accurate new set of 129 empirical galaxy template SEDs from Brown et al. (2014). A key advantage of our method {{is that we can}} reliably estimate random errors in computed <b>absolute</b> <b>magnitudes</b> due to galaxy diversity, photometric error and redshift error. We derive K-corrections for the five Sloan Digital Sky Survey filters and provide parameter tables for use by the astronomical community. Using the New York Value-Added Galaxy Catalog we compare our K-corrections with those from kcorrect. Our K-corrections produce <b>absolute</b> <b>magnitudes</b> that are generally in good agreement with kcorrect. <b>Absolute</b> griz <b>magnitudes</b> differ by less than 0. 02 mag, and those in the u-band by ∼ 0. 04 mag. The evolution of rest-frame colors as a function of redshift is better behaved using our method, with relatively few galaxies being assigned anomalously red colors and a tight red sequence being observed across the whole 0. 0 < z< 0. 5 redshift range...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We present Hβ {{photometry}} of 233 southern CP 2 stars (covering {{the magnetic}} Ap stars {{according to the}} definition by Preston 1974) brighter than V < 8. 5 mag {{from the list of}} Bidelman & MacConnell (1973). <b>Absolute</b> <b>magnitudes</b> derived from this photometry together with already existing uvby photometry is confronted with Hipparcos results available for a common subset of 152 stars. In order to compare peculiar with normal stars, we identified a sample of 1147 normal B to F-type stars using their published uvbyβ and Hipparcos data. For our analysis we divide both samples into three temperature as well as two Hipparcos parallax accuracy groups. The error distribution of both samples proved to be statistically comparable. As a result the <b>absolute</b> <b>magnitudes</b> for the B-type CP 2 stars show up to be significantly too bright by an average of 0. 5 mag using the actual photometric calibration.

40|$|Red clump {{stars are}} {{fundamental}} distance indicators in astrophysics, although theoretical stellar models predict a dependence of <b>absolute</b> <b>magnitudes</b> with ages. This effect is particularly strong below 2 Gyr, but even above this limit a mild age dependence is still expected. We use seismically identified red clump {{stars in the}} Kepler field for which we have reliable distances, masses and ages from the SAGA survey to first explore this effect. By excluding red clump stars with masses larger than 1. 6 Msun (corresponding to ages younger than 2 Gyr), we derive robust calibrations linking intrinsic colors to <b>absolute</b> <b>magnitudes</b> in the following photometric systems: Strömgren by, Johnson BV, Sloan griz, 2 MASS JHK_s and WISE W 1 W 2 W 3. With the precision achieved we also detect a slope of <b>absolute</b> <b>magnitudes</b> 0. 020 (0. 003) mag per Gyrin the infrared, implying that distance calibrations of clump stars can be off by up to 0. 2 mag in the infrared (over the range from 2 Gyr to 12 Gyr) if their ages are unknown. Even larger uncertainties affect optical bands, because of the stronger interdependency of <b>absolute</b> <b>magnitudes</b> on colors and age. Our distance calibrations are ultimately based on asteroseismology, and we show how the distance scale {{can be used to}} test the accuracy of seismic scaling relations. Within the uncertainties our calibrations are in agreement with those built upon local red clump with Hipparcos parallaxes, although we find a tension which if confirmed would imply that scaling relations overestimate radii of red clump stars by 2 (+- 20...|$|R

The possibility of different groupings of δ Scuti stars based on the <b>absolute</b> <b>magnitudes</b> is briefly discussed.

Colors and <b>absolute</b> <b>magnitudes</b> are calculated using both a standard Milky Way extinction law {{and one for the}} Large Magellanic Cloud that has been modified by circumstellar scattering. We find very different behavior in the near-UV filters (uvw 1 _(rc) covering ~ 2600 - 3300 Å after removing optical light, and u ≈ 3000 - 4000 Å) compared to a mid-UV filter (uvm 2 ≈ 2000 - 2400 Å). The uvw 1 _(rc) – b colors show a scatter of ~ 0. 3 mag while uvm 2 –b scatters by nearly 0. 9 mag. Similarly, while the scatter in colors between neighboring filters is small in the optical and somewhat larger in the near-UV, the large scatter in the uvm 2 – uvw 1 colors implies significantly larger spectral variability below 2600 Å. We find that in the near-UV the <b>absolute</b> <b>magnitudes</b> at peak brightness of normal SNe Ia in our sample are correlated with the optical decay rate with a scatter of 0. 4 mag, comparable to that found for the optical in our sample. However, in the mid-UV the scatter is larger, ~ 1 mag, possibly indicating differences in metallicity. We find no strong correlation between either the UV light-curve shapes or the UV colors and the UV <b>absolute</b> <b>magnitudes.</b> With larger samples, the UV luminosity might be useful as an additional constraint to help determine distance, extinction, and metallicity in order to improve the utility of SNe Ia as standardized candles...|$|R
