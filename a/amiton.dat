5000|$|VG (IUPAC name: O,O-diethyl S-2-(diethylamino)ethyl phosphorothioate) (also called <b>Amiton</b> or Tetram) is a [...] "V-series" [...] {{nerve agent}} {{chemically}} {{similar to the}} better-known VX nerve agent. Tetram is the common Russian name for the substance. <b>Amiton</b> was the trade name for the substance when it was marketed as an insecticide by ICI in the mid-1950s.|$|E
50|$|Phosphorus pentasulfide is a dual-use material, for the {{production}} of early insecticides such as <b>Amiton</b> and also for the manufacture of the related VX nerve agents.|$|E
50|$|Ranajit Ghosh, {{a chemist}} at the Plant Protection Laboratories of Imperial Chemical Industries was {{investigating}} {{a class of}} organophosphate compounds (organophosphate esters of substituted aminoethanethiols), {{for use as a}} pesticide. In 1954, ICI put one of them on the market under the trade name <b>Amiton.</b> It was subsequently withdrawn, as it was too toxic for safe use.|$|E
50|$|The {{toxicity}} {{did not go}} unnoticed, and {{samples of}} it {{were sent to the}} research facility at Porton Down for evaluation. After the evaluation was complete, several members of this class of compounds were developed into a new group of much more lethal nerve agents, the V agents. The best-known of these is probably VX, assigned the UK Rainbow Code Purple Possum, with the Russian V-Agent coming a close second (<b>Amiton</b> is largely forgotten as VG).|$|E
5000|$|The {{discovery}} {{occurred when}} the chemists were investigating a class of organophosphate compounds (organophosphate esters of substituted aminoethanethiols). [...] Like Gerhard Schrader, an earlier investigator of organophosphates, Ghosh found that they were quite effective pesticides. In 1954, ICI put one {{of them on the}} market under the trade name <b>Amiton.</b> It was subsequently withdrawn, as it was too toxic for safe use. The toxicity did not go unnoticed, and samples of it had been sent to the British Armed Forces research facility at Porton Down for evaluation. After the evaluation was complete, several members of this class of compounds became a new group of nerve agents, the V agents. The best-known of these is probably VX, assigned the UK Rainbow Code Purple Possum, with the Russian V-Agent (VR) coming a close second (<b>Amiton</b> is largely forgotten as VG). This class of compounds is also sometimes known as Tammelin's esters, after Lars-Erik Tammelin of the Swedish National Defence Research Institute. Tammelin was also conducting research on this class of compounds in 1952, but did not widely publicize his work. The name is a contraction of the words [...] "venomous agent X".|$|E
5000|$|In 1952, {{researchers}} in Porton Down, England, invented the VX nerve agent, {{inspired by the}} commercial pesticide <b>Amiton.</b> The UK soon unilaterally abandoned the chemical weapons and chemical weapons research. In 1958 the British government traded their VX technology with the United States in exchange for information on thermonuclear weapons; by 1961 the US was producing large amounts of VX and performed its own nerve agent research. The four agents (VE, VG, VM, VX) are collectively known as the [...] "V-Series" [...] of nerve agents.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the early}} 1950s {{at least three}} {{chemical}} companies working on organo-phosphorus insecticides independently discovered the amazing toxicity of these chemicals. In 1952, Dr. Ranajit Ghosh, a chemist working for ICI at their Plant Protection Laboratories was investigating the potential of organophosphate esters of substituted aminoethanethiols for use as pesticides. Like the earlier German investigators of organophosphates in the late 1930s who had discovered the G-series nerve agents, Dr. Ghosh discovered that their action on cholinesterase made them effective pesticides. One of them, <b>Amiton,</b> was described in a 1955 paper by Ghosh and another chemist, J. F. Newman, as being particularly effective against mites. It was brought to market as an insecticide by the company in 1954 but was subsequently withdrawn as too toxic.|$|E
50|$|The V-series is {{the second}} family of nerve agents and {{contains}} five well known members: VE, VG, VM, VR, and VX, along with several more obscure analogues. This class of compounds is also sometimes known as Tammelin's esters, after Lars-Erik Tammelin of the Swedish National Defence Research Institute. The most studied agent in this family, VX, was invented in the 1950s at Porton Down in the United Kingdom. Ranajit Ghosh, a chemist at the Plant Protection Laboratories of Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) was investigating a class of organophosphate compounds (organophosphate esters of substituted aminoethanethiols). Like Schrader, Ghosh found that they were quite effective pesticides. In 1954, ICI put one {{of them on the}} market under the trade name <b>Amiton.</b> It was subsequently withdrawn, as it was too toxic for safe use. The toxicity did not go unnoticed and some of the more toxic materials had been sent to the British Armed Forces research facility at Porton Down for evaluation. After the evaluation was complete, several members of this class of compounds became a new group of nerve agents, the V agents (depending on the source, the V stands for Victory, Venomous, or Viscous). The best known of these is probably VX, with VR ("Russian V-gas") coming a close second (<b>Amiton</b> is largely forgotten as VG). All of the V-agents are persistent agents, meaning that these agents do not degrade or wash away easily and can therefore remain on clothes and other surfaces for long periods. In use, this allows the V-agents to be used to blanket terrain to guide or curtail the movement of enemy ground forces. The consistency of these agents is similar to oil; as a result, the contact hazard for V-agents is primarily - but not exclusively - dermal. VX was the only V-series agent that was fielded by the US as a munition, in rockets, artillery shells, airplane spray tanks, and landmines.|$|E

40|$|<b>Amiton</b> (O,O-diethyl-S-[2 -(diethylamino) ethyl] phosphorothiolate), {{otherwise}} known as VG, is listed in Schedule 2 of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and has a structure closely related to VX (O-ethyl-S-(2 -diisopropylamino) ethyl methylphosphonothiolate). Fragmentation of protonated VG in the gas phase was performed using an electrospray ionisation ion trap mass spectrometer (ESI-ITMS) and revealed several characteristic product ions. Quantum chemical calculations provide the most probable structures for these ions {{as well as the}} likely unimolecular mechanisms by which they are formed. The decomposition pathways predicted by computation are consistent with deuterium labeling studies. The combination of experimental and theoretical data suggests that the fragmentation pathways of VG and analogous organophosphorus nerve agents, such as VX and Russian VX, are predictable and as such ESI tandem mass spectrometry is a powerful tool for the verification of unknown compounds listed in the CWC...|$|E
