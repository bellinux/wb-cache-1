His first speech on Suez (2 August 1956) attacked Nasser and was welcomed by many Conservatives, and implied that he would {{support the use of}} force, but in Brivati's view did not give enough emphasis to his stipulation that it be done through the United Nations. He had believed Eden’s assurances that {{he had no intention of}} using force. In two letters to Eden sent on 3 and 10 August Gaitskell condemned Nasser, but warned that he would not support any action that violated the United Nations charter. In his letter of 10 August, Gaitskell wrote: [...] "Lest there should be <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> about my personal attitude, let me say that I could not regard an armed attack on Egypt by ourselves and the French as justified by anything which Nasser has done so far or as consistent with the Charter of the United Nations. Nor, in my opinion, would such an attack be justified in order to impose a system of international control over the canal - desirable though this is. If, of course, the whole matter were to be taken to the United Nations and if Egypt were to be condemned by them as aggressors, then, of course, the position would be different. And if further action which amounted to obvious aggression by Egypt were taken by Nasser, then again it would be different. So far what Nasser has done amounts to a threat, a grave threat to us and to others, which certainly cannot be ignored; but it is only a threat, not in my opinion justifying retaliation by war." ...|$|E
5000|$|Gaitskell's support {{became more}} cautious. On 2 August {{he said of}} Nasser's behaviour, [...] "It is all very familiar. It {{is exactly the same}} that we {{encountered}} from Mussolini and Hitler in those years before the war". He cautioned Eden, however, that [...] "we must not, therefore, allow ourselves to get into a position where we might be denounced in the Security Council as aggressors, or where the majority of the Assembly was against us". He had earlier warned Eden that Labour might not support Britain acting alone against Egypt. In two letters to Eden sent on 3 and 10 August 1956, Gaitskell condemned Nasser but again warned that he would not support any action that violated the United Nations charter. In his letter of 10 August, Gaitskell wrote: Lest there should be <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> about my personal attitude, let me say that I could not regard an armed attack on Egypt by ourselves and the French as justified by anything which Nasser has done so far or as consistent with the Charter of the United Nations.

In the month following the public release of the interface changes suggested in this paper in august 2008 the Internet based sports games company PowerChallenge saw an increase in sales of more than 60 % (see results). Using heuristic evaluation and simple user testing the complexity of accessing PowerChallenge’s products has been drastically reduced and this has resulted in fewer customers losing their way in the process. Along with slimlining the process of acquiring products the entire web portal has had a graphics remake to make a trustworthy first impression on users. The increased fear of phishing 1 and general uncertainty {{about the safety of}} online shopping[6] makes many users abandon their intentions of spending money whenever the site drastically changes it’s looks {{in the middle of the}} payment flow.

It seems I haven’t {{seen you}} in months, darling, and it’s only been about twenty-eight hours. Every one seems to get longer and longer. Did you get to bed early Sunday night, young lady? You’d better have, {{you must have been}} tired, I know I was. I’m going to hit the sack right after I mail this. I feel like the wreck of the Hesperus. Did you have any snow down thar in New York? We had our first snow squall today, and man, is it cold. I was flying the first period this morning, and I could see the storm coming in from the North West like a huge white curtain. It was the first time I ever saw a snow storm from the air. It didn’t stick though, but it was snow. I knew {{something}} important had to happen this week. I’ve been looking over the financial situation, hon, and allowing for everything, a small amount of recreation included, I ought to have $ 4. 38 saved by March if I budget myself very carefully. Not bad for me, eh? But seriously, angel, it’s not as bad as all that. I’ve got some pretty good ideas as to how to raise some money, and I was talking to a fellow here that just bought an engagement and a wedding ring, and they’re not too expensive, at least not $ 500. But as you said before, you don’t get married every day, so by God we’re going to have the best. But most of all, darling, I want you to be happy. If there is ever <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind,</b> just let me know. We’ve still got {{a lot of things to}} settle, hon. I want to have a long talk with you this weekend. Oh by the way, have you told your father yet? I wonder what he’ll have to say. Maybe I better send him another carton of cigarettes. Well hon, the sergeant just finished drawing my bath, I don’t want to keep him waiting. Give my best to your family. Your mother is really marvelous. I love you. Take care of yourself and get some sleep. I think of you always honey, and miss you terribly. All my loveJudd[Transcription ends...|$|E
