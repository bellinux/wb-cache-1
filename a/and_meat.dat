The modified Atkins diet is less complex to explain and prepare and requires less support from a dietitian.|$|E

Rice dishes are usually the main dish of Palestinian dinner, because they consist of a variety of ingredients commonly found within the Palestinian land.

Meat is almost always present in Palestinian dishes.|$|E
