5|$|Soon {{after his}} arrival at Sigeberht's court, Felix {{established}} a church at Dommoc, his episcopal see, which is widely taken to mean Dunwich, on the Suffolk coast. Dunwich has since been almost totally destroyed by the effects of coastal erosion. Other historians have suggested as an <b>alternative</b> <b>site</b> for Felix's see the coastal Walton, Suffolk near Felixstowe, where {{there was once a}} Roman fort. A church and priory were dedicated to him there by Roger Bigod in 1105.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Felix was associated with Irish missionary activity in Francia, which was centred in Burgundy and was particularly associated with Columbanus and Luxeuil Abbey. Columbanus had arrived in Francia in about 590, after leaving Bangor along with twelve companions and going into voluntary exile. Upon Columbanus's arrival, he was encouraged to stay, and in about 592 settled at Annegay, but was then forced to find an <b>alternative</b> <b>site</b> for a monastery at Luxeuil, when lay people and the sick continually sought the counsel of himself and his fellow monks.|$|E
5|$|The {{commander}} of the Bastille {{at the time was}} Bernard-René de Launay, a conscientious but minor military officer. Tensions surrounding the Bastille had been rising for several weeks. Only eight prisoners remained in the fortress, but one of these, the Marquis de Sade, had stoked the link between the revolution and the Bastille, addressing the public from his walks on top of the towers and, once this was forbidden, shouting from the window of his cell. Sade began to claim that the authorities planned to massacre the prisoners in the castle, which resulted in the governor removing him to an <b>alternative</b> <b>site</b> in early July.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{station was}} built by William Cubitt. The first plan was to construct a building near the Regent's Canal in Islington that would provide a useful connection for London dockland traffic, before Robert Stephenson proposed an <b>alternative</b> <b>site</b> at Marble Arch. This was rejected by a provisional committee, and a proposal to end the line at Maiden Lane {{was rejected by the}} House of Lords in 1832. A terminus at Camden Town was announced by Stephenson the following year, receiving Royal Assent on 6 May, before an extension was approved in 1834, allowing the line to reach Euston Grove.|$|E
5|$|In March 2011 Manchester City Council began {{a public}} {{consultation}} on moving the cenotaph to an <b>alternative</b> <b>site</b> {{in the square}} to allow for expansion of the Metrolink tram network. The plans had a mixed reception. Some objections {{were made by the}} public but there was support from veterans, church, and heritage groups. The relocation was approved in 2012, and in January 2014 it was dismantled before it was cleaned and restored. In 2014 it was reconstructed in a new memorial garden {{on the opposite side of}} the square aligned with Manchester Town Hall's southern entrance. The city council commissioned conservation architects Stephen Levrant Heritage Architecture to manage the relocation and design the new setting which places the cenotaph, obelisks and stone on a plinth in an oval surrounded by a low wall. The garden opened to the public in September 2014. The cenotaph was damaged in the first week when skateboarders began using the area as a skatepark. Repair work costing £4,000 started shortly afterwards, and extra security measures (including 24-hour CCTV) were put in place.|$|E
5|$|Small Heath Alliance – the {{original}} name of Birmingham City Football Club – played their first home games on waste ground off Arthur Street, in the Bordesley Green district of Birmingham, {{very near the}} site where St Andrew's would be built. In 1876, they made a temporary move to a fenced-off field in Ladypool Road, Sparkbrook, with an estimated capacity of 3,000 spectators; because the field was enclosed, admission could be charged. Interest in the team grew, {{and a year later}} they moved again, this time to a rented field in Small Heath, situated on the eastern edge of Birmingham's built-up area, just north of the main road to Coventry. This ground, which became known as Muntz Street, had four sides of open terracing, a small covered wooden stand, and a changing-room for the players. When first opened it could hold approximately 10,000 spectators. Over the years the height of the terracing was raised, which increased the capacity to around 30,000, but this became insufficient to cope with the demand. The attendance at a match in 1905 against local rivals Aston Villa was officially recorded as 28,000 spectators, but several thousand more climbed walls or forced turnstiles to gain entry. The landlords refused to sell the freehold of the ground, nor would they permit major extensions to be made. As the board of directors estimated that staying at Muntz Street was costing the club £2,000 a year (£ at today's prices), they began the search for an <b>alternative</b> <b>site.</b>|$|E

50|$|The state {{government}} dropped {{the idea of}} examining <b>alternative</b> <b>sites</b> in February 2014 as it had secured all necessary approvals for the Panvel site.|$|R
50|$|Thus, {{they need}} to secure <b>alternative</b> <b>sites</b> unless {{restrictions}} are waived due to extreme or otherwise unusual weather. Such waivers may be either on a one-time basis, or pursuant to memorandum of understanding (MOU's) with relevant agencies; however, existing shelter sites are typically {{at the highest level}} of use compatible with neighborhood character and the political balance of power. Few warming center sites appear to be utilizing the same building as routine homeless shelter operations, and the preponderance of them do situate in <b>alternative</b> <b>sites.</b>|$|R
25|$|By {{the end of}} 1887, no <b>alternative</b> <b>site</b> {{had become}} {{available}} and the original proposals were renewed. There were slight amendments made to the proposals, but again the proposals were rejected.|$|E
25|$|A {{proposal}} was floated during the 1950s to relocate the monument to an <b>alternative</b> <b>site</b> {{in a city}} park in order to ease traffic congestion in downtown Lancaster. However, the relocation idea was abandoned and the memorial remained at its original location.|$|E
25|$|Muscat {{responded to}} the environmentalists' {{criticism}} by stating that the Malta Environment and Planning Authority would consider other sites {{as long as they}} are located in the southern part of the island. A public consultation process was subsequently made in order to select an <b>alternative</b> <b>site</b> for the university campus.|$|E

25|$|In 1607, {{the company}} {{decided to build}} its own ships and leased a yard on the River Thames at Deptford. By 1614, the yard having become too small, an <b>alternative</b> <b>site</b> was {{acquired}} at Blackwall: the new yard was fully operational by 1617. It was sold in 1656, although for some years East India Company ships continued to be built and repaired there under the new owners.|$|E
25|$|In 1893, Chung, Keng Quee {{acquired}} two adjacent properties along Church Street on Penang Island. The {{first was}} the former headquarters of the Ghee Hin - the Hai San had ousted them in the 1870s. The second was a Chinese school, the Goh Hock Tong (or Ng Fook Tong in Cantonese) meaning Five Luck Villa. He offered the school an <b>alternative</b> <b>site</b> in Chulia Street, where a new building was completed in 1898.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the opening}} of the Perth Airport, {{civilian}} air services for the city were provided from Maylands Airport located in Maylands (in operation since 1924), {{as well as on the}} city's foreshore at Langley Park. By the end of the 1930s, it became clear that the Maylands Aerodrome was limited in the size and speed of aircraft it was able to handle thus causing them to seek an <b>alternative</b> <b>site</b> for a future airport.|$|E
50|$|In 1984 and 1985, the Conservative Party-led {{local council}} {{effectively}} banned the festival by reclaiming the festival site for 'development' {{and refusing to}} grant licences for any <b>alternative</b> <b>sites</b> in the Reading area.|$|R

25|$|Circa 1870, the inbound 'Clarke Reserve' was {{proposed}} as an <b>alternative</b> <b>site</b> for the Old Melbourne Cemetery. It was later agreed that an area at Springvale {{was a better}} site. The 'Clarke Reserve' was established in 1909 as a State Pine forest called the Frankston Pine Plantation. W.J. Hartland was appointed as Conservator in Charge. Pinus radiata was the most successful of the various species planted. A count taken of numbers revealed that over 1 million trees had been planted.|$|E
25|$|Following World War I, {{the number}} of users rose sharply and by 1926 the DZB had 3,500 users. The Great Depression forced the library into a rigid austerity, {{resulting}} in budget cuts and layoffs. In 1935 the DZB moved into the commercial publishing house Druckhaus Klepzig on the Täubchenweg in Leipzig. This building was later destroyed in an Allied bombing raid in December 1943 and over 30,000 of the library's books were lost. What little remained of the collection was set up at an <b>alternative</b> <b>site</b> at Döbeln in 1944.|$|E
25|$|Based on this information, the Patriarch Constantius I (1830–1834) {{identified}} the Eski Imaret with the Pantepoptes church. This identification {{has been largely}} accepted since, {{with the exception of}} Cyril Mango, who argued that the building's location did not actually allow for complete overview of the Golden Horn, and proposed the area currently occupied by the Yavuz Sultan Selim Mosque as an <b>alternative</b> <b>site</b> for the Pantepoptes Monastery. Austay-Effenberger and Effenberger agreed with Mango, and proposed an identification with the Church of St. Constantine, founded by the Empress Theophano in the early 10th century, highlighting its similarities to the contemporaneous Lips Monastery.|$|E

50|$|The Human Services Department {{has since}} relented in its demand, {{partly due to}} public outrage. In fall of 2012, a {{transition}} program was recommended by a Mayor-appointed Task Force. However, no <b>alternative</b> <b>sites</b> have yet been proposed.|$|R
25|$|The next year, 1923, Soviet {{authorities}} {{were eager to}} expand the Toikino experiment of 1922. The Soviet People's Commissariat of Agriculture offered a large tract of fertile land in the Kuban region, {{just north of the}} Black Sea for another model farm. Working with the Friends of Soviet Russia organization, Hal Ware organized a party of 40 to make the trip, including agricultural specialists, a doctor, and a nurse. Ware arrived in Soviet Russia to inspect the land designated for the project only to be told by Soviet officials that the deal was off — local peasants had begun to allocate the land reserved for the project amongst themselves. An <b>alternative</b> <b>site</b> in the North Caucasus was hastily located, but the project was delayed.|$|E
25|$|The Official History {{records that}} the AA {{artillery}} in Tobruk was 'incessantly in action against attacks of all kinds, from all heights, but especially by dive-bombers'. The regimental historian notes that these Stuka attacks concentrated on gun positions, {{which was a}} serious threat to HAA sites, whose instruments could not cope with the rapid height changes. The gunners devised a tactic of opening fire with short fuzes just before the dive started, to force the pilots to fly through a ring of bursts. The battery cooks, drivers and clerks then joined in, firing machine-guns and captured 20mm Breda guns. This aggressive method was known as 'Porcupine', and was so effective that the Luftwaffe changed to high-level bombing. Each mobile HAA troop established at least one <b>alternative</b> <b>site</b> and the guns were regularly switched between them, the empty sites being rigged up as dummies. The two available gun laying (GL Mk I) radar sets had to be positioned away from the vulnerable gun sites and used for early warning to supplement the single RAF radar, and a ring of searchlights operated round the harbour at night. Harbour defence was by pre-arranged barrages by five of the six HAA troops, the sixth troop remaining on watch for other raiders. 152 Battery dug in west of the harbour engaged 1000 enemy aircraft in a six-month period. 4th AA Brigade recorded that there was a steady decline in numbers of aircraft attacking as the siege went on, with the attackers switching to high-level and night attacks. In the last two months of the siege, troops of HAA guns took it in turn to move out to the perimeter and take on ground targets under the control of 9th Australian Division. Their long-range harassing fire made up for the shortage of medium artillery. In September 1941, the batteries of 51st HAA Rgt were relieved and left Tobruk by sea to rejoin RHQ for rest and refit in Palestine.|$|E
500|$|In a paper {{published}} in 2006, historian Alex Woolf gives {{a number of}} reasons for doubting Dunnichen as the battle site, most notably the absence of [...] "inaccessible mountains" [...] in mid-Angus. He makes a case for an <b>alternative</b> <b>site</b> at Dunachton in Badenoch (...) , on the north-western shore of Loch Insh, which shares Dunnichen's toponomical origin of Dún Nechtain. James Fraser of Edinburgh University suggests that, while {{it is too early to}} discount Dunnichen as a potential battle site, locating it there requires an amount of [...] "special pleading" [...] that Dunachton does not need.|$|E
50|$|C - Planning {{permission}} {{should not}} normally be granted. Where {{it is considered}} that permission should be given, for example {{because there are no}} <b>alternative</b> <b>sites</b> available, conditions should be imposed to ensure a commensurate level of protection against noise.|$|R
40|$|Popular musical {{expressions}} {{are important}} for discourses of citizenship and belonging. Focusing on popular music and political processes in Ethiopia today, this discussion uses Tewodros Kassahun aka Teddy Afro’s music as an example. Teddy Afro is a popular voice challenging the prevailing political discourse in Ethiopia. Several of Afro’s songs have been banned by the government {{on radio and television}} in Ethiopia, but are found to provide <b>alternative</b> <b>sites</b> of political and cultural resistance to the autocratic regime. Reasons for censorship are discussed as well as how music can provide <b>alternative</b> <b>sites</b> of resistance. The findings show that oppressing political expressions may not always kill the ideas, as they may find alternative arenas in the face of obstacles...|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to the comments received, changes and improvements {{to some of the}} sites, including the potential use of <b>alternative</b> <b>sites</b> and <b>alternative</b> technical solutions, were considered. Based on this a round of interim engagement took place between March 2011 and August 2011. During this phase residents around 11 specific sites were sent letters explaining that these sites were being considered as <b>alternative</b> <b>sites,</b> and inviting residents to attend drop-in sessions to pose questions and {{gain a better understanding of}} the project. In total ten two-day sessions and one community liaison meeting was held. These were attended by over 800 people. In all 168 comment cards and 147 pieces of site specific correspondence was received and considered.|$|R
