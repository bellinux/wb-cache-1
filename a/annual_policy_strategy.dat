40|$|From the Introduction]. Early in 2007, the European Commission {{published}} its <b>Annual</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Strategy</b> for 2008 {{in which}} it presents the Commission’s proposals for key initiatives to be taken forward in the next year. 1 The Commission’s document highlights its priority actions for 2008 and assesses financial and human resource implications. Along with the four strategic objectives of prosperity, solidarity, security and freedom, and a stronger Europe in the world, the Commission identifies three cross-cutting priorities: tackling climate change, pressing ahead with the Lisbon Strategy and managing migration flows to the EU. On {{the basis of this}} more general document, later in the year the Commission will present its concise Legislative and Work Programme for 2008. Given the long-term impact that the document thus will have, especially in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice in the EU (AFSJ), we consider it necessary to address some of the implications inherent in the articulated priorities and envisaged key actions. This Policy Brief is based on the contribution that the Justice and Home Affairs Unit of CEPS has submitted as written evidence to the inquiry of the European Union Select Committee of the UK House of Lords into the European Commission's <b>Annual</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Strategy</b> for 2008. The paper addresses two main areas covered by the Policy Strategy which are intrinsically related to our work in the AFSJ: 1. "Fighting Organised Crime and Terrorism"; and 2. "Freedom of Movement and Managing the EU's External Borders"...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} uncertainties {{surrounding the}} benefits and costs of a policy to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions from electricity generation in the eastern U. S. Under each of 18 scenarios examined, we find an <b>annual</b> <b>policy</b> would yield net benefits that {{are at least as}} great as those expected under the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) currently planned seasonal policy. Preferred (midpoint) assumptions yield additional benefits of $ 724 million per year under an <b>annual</b> <b>policy</b> compared to a seasonal one (1997 dollars). The subset of 11 northeastern states benefit the most from an <b>annual</b> <b>policy</b> relative to a seasonal one, but relative net benefits are also positive in the remaining states in the region. An <b>annual</b> <b>policy</b> implemented on a national basis appears to be slightly less cost-effective than the EPA’s policy under midpoint assumptions but it is more cost-effective under half of the scenarios we examine. emissions trading, electricity, particulates, nitrogen oxides, NOX, health benefits, market structure, restructuring, deregulation, value of statistical life, uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the literature about the differences between money and direct inflation targeting. The experiences of the implemented monetary <b>policy</b> <b>strategies</b> in Germany, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom are described. Finally, the paper empirically analyses the monetary <b>policy</b> <b>strategy</b> in Germany and the United Kingdom with the use of interest rate reaction functions. The empirical results suggest that, despite differences in monetary <b>policy</b> <b>strategy,</b> the use of the interest rate instrument is governed especially by the inflationary development. ...|$|R
