5|$|The U.S. offered two squadrons of Boeing B-47 Stratojets {{for free}} lease pending the {{delivery}} of the F-111; Australia declined the offer in June 1964—despite the aircraft having been demonstrated around the country just before the 1963 election as an interim Canberra replacement, likely <b>another</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> the American preference for Menzies— because the B-47 did not offer significant improvements over the Canberra and, like the V bombers, would require longer runways.|$|E
5|$|When the {{pressure}} within the skull (intracranial pressure, abbreviated ICP) rises too high, {{it can be}} deadly. Signs of increased ICP include decreasing level of consciousness, paralysis or weakness {{on one side of}} the body, and a blown pupil, one that fails to constrict in response to light or is slow to do so. Cushing's triad, a slow heart rate with high blood pressure and respiratory depression is a classic manifestation of significantly raised ICP. Anisocoria, unequal pupil size, is <b>another</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> serious TBI. Abnormal posturing, a characteristic positioning of the limbs caused by severe diffuse injury or high ICP, is an ominous sign.|$|E
5|$|Victorious Boxers {{does not}} use a damage or life meter. Instead, visible damage {{can be seen on}} a boxer's face, which is most {{noticeable}} between rounds when the characters are sitting in their corners. The amount of damage taken is reflected by bruises, swelling, and black eyes on the characters' faces. <b>Another</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> damage is the characters' speed of movement throughout the fight. The characters begin to move slower and the controls become less responsive to simulate fatigue. The more a boxer is hit or uses special moves, the more their stamina is affected. Distance is a factor in determining a punch's damage. For example, a jab thrown while next to an opponent will not do as much damage as it would at arms length. Also, right hooks do not do as much damage if the character is positioned to the opponent's left and vice versa.|$|E

5|$|While the Polish {{king and}} the Senate of Poland were debating on the course of action, the {{patience}} of foreign powers was running out. Eventually, {{one of the most}} prominent opponents of agreeing to the foreign demands, bishop Adam Stanisław Krasiński, was abducted by Cossacks and transported to Warsaw, where the foreign ambassadors demanded that the King and the Senate call in the Sejm (the entire Polish parliament) to ratify the partition. In <b>another</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> their influence, the next meeting of the Senate saw the senators from the annexed territories denied participation (those denied participation included the bishop of Inflanty, the voivode of Ruthenia and the voivode of Witebsk). When no help was forthcoming and the armies of the combined nations occupied Warsaw to compel by force of arms the calling of the assembly, no alternative was available save passive submission to their will. Warsaw was de facto a garrison of the foreign powers, with their forces commanded by the Austrian (or Russian, sources vary) general Abram Romanius (Abraham). On 19 April the Senate agreed to call for the Sejm to convene.|$|E

25|$|India's Left {{parties that}} have criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's {{government}} on the India-US civilian nuclear deal had vehemently protested the exercise, seeing it as <b>another</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> the growing closeness between the two countries.

25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> Graves' {{disease is}} hyperthyroidism, i.e., {{overproduction}} of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. Normal thyroid levels are also seen, and occasionally also hypothyroidism, which may assist in causing goiter (though {{it is not}} the cause of the Graves' disease). Hyperthyroidism in Graves' disease is confirmed, as with any other cause of hyperthyroidism, by measuring elevated blood levels of free (unbound) T3 and T4.|$|E
25|$|While {{this was}} taking place, in 1909 Stieglitz was {{notified}} about yet <b>another</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> the increasingly difficult times. London’s Linked Ring, which {{for more than}} a decade Stieglitz had looked to as model for the Photo-Secession, finally dissolved in antipathy. Stieglitz knew this signaled the end of an era, but rather than be set back by these changes he began making plans to integrate Camera Work even further into the realm of modern art.|$|E
25|$|The {{definitive}} {{diagnosis is}} {{the recovery of}} adult worms either by coughing them up or removing them with forceps, a bronchoscope, or endoscopic instruments. However, worms might be difficult to remove if firmly attached to the bronchial walls. Finding M. laryngeus eggs in the sputum or feces is <b>another</b> sure <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> infection.|$|R

25|$|On 29 September 1885, as <b>another</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> peace, Bismarck {{proposed}} the Pope as arbiter {{in a dispute}} with Spain about the Caroline Islands and accepted his verdict in favour of Spain. In gratitude but to the great horror of Catholics, the Pope awarded Bismarck the Supreme Order of Christ, the highest order of chivalry to be granted by the Holy See. Bismarck was the only Protestant ever to receive this award.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> Stickler {{syndrome}} is mild to {{severe hearing loss}} that, for some people, may be progressive (see hearing loss with craniofacial syndromes). The joints of affected {{children and young adults}} may be very flexible (hypermobile). Arthritis often appears at an early age and worsens as a person gets older. Learning difficulties, not intelligence, can also occur because of hearing and sight impairments if the school is not informed and the student is not assisted within the learning environment.|$|E
25|$|In Florida, 1964 was {{the year}} when a Republican {{candidate}} for governor polled more than 36.1% in the general election, <b>another</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> changing politics. It was a strong showing for relative newcomer Claude R. Kirk, Jr., a Democrat-turned-Republican from California, as he ran against veteran Democratic U.S. Senator Spessard Holland, the former governor {{and head of the}} Florida Democratic establishment. Trying to build up recognition and support, Kirk appealed to Cramer to address meetings held during the delegate and national committeeman races, and thus became acquainted with Republican party activists.|$|E

25|$|World War II saw {{the removal}} of {{expatriate}} leadership and a path towards an indigenous church was more clearly set. The Malayan Christian Council (MCC), founded in 1948, coordinated mission groups during the Malayan Emergency. Chinese relocated into 'New Villages' were served by missionaries, sometimes ex-China, who worked alongside local Christians in social and medical work. However, after independence in 1957, many churches were overdependent on expatriates. In the 1970s churches developed structures independent of Singapore {{as well as of}} overseas support. Recent growth in independent churches is <b>another</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> a desire to establish a Malaysian Christian identity.|$|E
25|$|Since 2003, Argentina and Brazil have coordinated their {{positions}} in the multilateral fora, {{as can be seen}} by their joint participation in the agricultural negotiations at the WTO meeting in Cancún, their joint position in regards {{to the creation of the}} Free Trade Area of the Americas, and their articulation at the G-20 to reform the international financial system. The creation of the Union of South American Nations, in 2008, was a landmark in the new foreign policies of Brazil and Argentina. In <b>another</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> mutual trust, since 2003, diplomats from both countries occupy a single seat in the United Nations Security Council when either of them hold a non-permanent seat.|$|E
25|$|Of course, Cnut's {{journey to}} Rome in 1027 is <b>another</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> his {{dedication}} to the Christian religion. It may be {{that he went to}} attend the coronation of Conrad II in order to improve relations between the two powers, yet he had previously made a vow to seek the favour of St Peter, the keeper of the keys to the heavenly kingdom. While in Rome, Cnut made an agreement with the Pope to reduce the fees paid by the English archbishops to receive their pallium. He also arranged that travellers from his realm not be straightened by unjust tolls and that they should be safeguarded on their way to and from Rome. Some evidence exists for a second journey in 1030.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1914, Kinsey entered Bowdoin College, where he studied {{entomology}} under Manton Copeland, and {{was admitted to the}} Zeta Psi fraternity, in whose house he lived for much of his time at college. In 1916 Kinsey was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa society and graduated magna cum laude, with degrees in biology and psychology. Afred Seguine Kinsey did not attend his son's graduation ceremony from Bowdoin, possibly as <b>another</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> disapproval of his son's choice of career and studies. Kinsey continued his graduate studies at Harvard University's Bussey Institute, which had one of the most highly regarded biology programs in the United States. It was there that Kinsey studied applied biology under William Morton Wheeler, a scientist who made outstanding contributions to entomology. Under Wheeler, Kinsey worked almost completely autonomously, which suited both men quite well.|$|E
500|$|Balzac's {{style in}} Le Père Goriot is {{influenced}} by the American novelist James Fenimore Cooper and Scottish writer Walter Scott. In Cooper's representations of Native Americans, Balzac saw a human barbarism that survived through attempts at civilization. In a preface to the second edition in 1835, Balzac wrote that the title character Goriot– who made his fortune selling vermicelli during a time of widespread hunger– was an [...] "Illinois of the flour trade" [...] and a [...] "Huron of the grain market". Vautrin refers to Paris as [...] "a forest of the New World where twenty varieties of savage tribes clash"– <b>another</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> Cooper's influence.|$|E
500|$|The {{diagnosis}} of DPB requires {{analysis of the}} lungs and bronchiolar tissues, which can require a lung biopsy, or the more preferred high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of the lungs. The diagnostic criteria include severe inflammation in all layers of the respiratory bronchioles and lung tissue lesions that appear as nodules within the terminal and respiratory bronchioles in both lungs. The nodules in DPB appear as opaque lumps when viewed on X-rays of the lung, and can cause airway obstruction, which is evaluated by a pulmonary function test, or PFT. [...] Lung X-rays can also reveal dilation of the bronchiolar passages, <b>another</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> DBP. HRCT scans often show blockages of some bronchiolar passages with mucus, which {{is referred to as}} the [...] "tree-in-bud" [...] pattern. [...] Hypoxemia, <b>another</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> breathing difficulty, is revealed by measuring the oxygen and carbon dioxide content of the blood, using a blood test called arterial blood gas. Other findings observed with DPB include the proliferation of lymphocytes (white blood cells that fight infection), neutrophils, and foamy histiocytes (tissue macrophages) in the lung lining. Bacteria such as H.influenzae and P.aeruginosa are also detectable, with the latter becoming more prominent as the disease progresses. The white blood, bacterial and other cellular content of the blood can be measured by taking a complete blood count (CBC). Elevated levels of IgG and IgA (classes of immunoglobulins) may be seen, as well as the presence of rheumatoid factor (an indicator of autoimmunity). Hemagglutination, a clumping of red blood cells in response to the presence of antibodies in the blood, may also occur. Neutrophils, beta-defensins, leukotrienes, and chemokines can also be detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid injected then removed from the bronchiolar airways of individuals with DPB, for evaluation.|$|E
