5|$|Schumacher's extra pace as {{a result}} of his lighter fuel loads meant he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> out enough of a gap to Häkkinen which enabled him to make an extra pit stop. Häkkinen's pace was very slow, {{allowing}} Nicola Larini to leapfrog him when the two-stoppers made their final pit stops.|$|E
5|$|At 00:30 {{hours on}} 28 March the convoy {{crossed over the}} shoals {{at the mouth of}} the Loire estuary, with Campbeltown {{scraping}} the bottom twice. Each time she was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> free, and the group proceeded on up toward the harbour in darkness. They had got to within about eight minutes passage from the dock gates when at 01:22 the entire convoy was illuminated by the combined searchlights of both banks of the estuary. A naval signal light demanded their identification.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006, Aulie's {{father was}} using a tractor to clear snow off a frozen dugout in {{anticipation}} of an outdoor shinny game on New Year's Day. The ice could not support {{the weight of the}} tractor, and he fell through. Aulie was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> his father {{out of the water and}} get him to safety. The Canadian Red Cross honoured Aulie with their Rescuer Award for his act.|$|E

5|$|Wallhead soon turned {{professional}} and on 30 April 2005, {{he made his}} debut at Cage Warriors: Ultimate Force. Jim fought Leslee Ojugbana, utilising knee strikes from the clinch, whilst preventing Ojugbana from succeeding with takedown attempts. After one-sided striking from Wallhead, Ojugbana gave up his back and Wallhead was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> off a rear naked choke for his debut win after just 64 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Agricultural and {{forestry}} work were the traditional {{uses of the}} Finnhorse. The Finnhorse was never bred to be a particularly large or heavy draught horse, {{as it was the}} only horse breed of the country, and versatility was desired as the Finnhorse was also used as the primary steed of the cavalry. The climate and conditions of Finland necessitated that the breed be durable and hardy. As a result, the Finnhorse remained small but tough, and could pull heavy loads in difficult terrain and even in chest-deep snow. Relative to its size, the Finnhorse is among the most powerful workhorses in the world with the best animals <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> as much as 200percent of their own weight.|$|E
5|$|Dress {{rehearsal}} for the sketch went poorly. During rehearsal, Belushi was having difficulty correctly parodying {{the character of}} James T. Kirk as originally portrayed by actor William Shatner. Belushi had sat for several hours while being made up {{so that he would}} look the part. Sketch writer O'Donoghue was worried that the sketch was too long and might not go over well with the audience. He knew that Belushi was a fan of Star Trek, and had previously rescued sketches that others thought would flop, but O'Donoghue was nervous that Belushi would not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> off a comedic performance on this occasion.|$|E
50|$|Another {{example of}} IFPRI's impact on policy {{formulation}} was the 2007-2008 world food price crisis.

5|$|In {{preparation}} for the fleet's approach to Quebec, James Cook surveyed {{a large portion of}} the river, including a dangerous channel known as The Traverse. Cook's ship was one of the first ships up the river, sounding the channel and guiding the fleet as it moved up, eventually landing Wolfe and his men on the Île d'Orléans on 28 June. The French attempted to attack the fleet by sending seven fire ships downriver to disrupt the landing, but the ships fired too early and British sailors in longboats were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> the flaming craft clear of the fleet.|$|E
5|$|The tall {{stranger}} {{says that}} he who draws the sword from the trunk shall receive it as a gift, and he who is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> free the sword shall never carry a better sword than it. The old man leaves the hall, and nobody knows who he was, or where he went. Everyone stands, trying their hand at pulling free the sword from the trunk of Barnstokkr. The noblest attempt to pull free the sword first followed by those ranked after them. Sigmund, son of King Völsung, takes his turn, and—as if the sword had lay loose for him—he draws it from the trunk. The saga then continues.|$|E
5|$|Unable to escape, Bompart finally {{abandoned}} his pretence of sailing for the Americas and instead turned north-west. During {{the next day}} high winds cost both Hoche and Anson a topmast, slowing both squadrons, but the repairs to Hoche were conducted faster and the French were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> ahead. For four more days pursuit continued directly north, until 4 October, when a storm descended and Bompart successfully outran Countess in the increasing darkness. In the high winds, Amelia was driven off course and away from her compatriots on 7 October while Anson again suffered damage, this time losing two topmasts.|$|E
50|$|At the restart, {{the running}} order was Hinchcliffe, Hunter-Reay, Sébastien Bourdais, Newgarden, and Dixon. Hinchcliffe was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> manage <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> out a lead on Hunter-Reay, but shortly thereafter, Hunter-Reay began <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> him back. Further back, {{a clash between}} Mikhail Aleshin and Tony Kanaan {{resulted}} in a puncture for Kanaan, dropping him down the order. Also in this time frame, Takuma Sato suddenly slowed on course and brought his car to a halt on an access lane.|$|R

50|$|The Dutch {{acquired}} the iron tipped, curved mouldboard, adjustable depth plough from the Chinese {{in the early}} 17th century. It {{had the advantage of}} being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> be <b>pulled</b> by one or two oxen compared to the six or eight needed by the heavy wheeled northern European plough. The Dutch plough was brought to Britain by Dutch contractors who were hired to drain East Anglian fens and Somerset moors. The plough was extremely successful on wet, boggy soil, but soon was used on ordinary land.|$|R
5|$|At 02:45, Amethyst was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> {{across the}} bows of Niémen, inflicting a devastating raking {{fire on the}} French ship which caused terrible damage. Niémen surged forward into Amethyst, but the {{collision}} caused little damage and at 03:00 Amethyst again raked her opponent, this time from the east. The frigates were so close that shot from Amethyst started fires among Niémens hammock netting, placed along the decks to deter boarding actions. At 03:15, Niémens mizenmast and main topmast collapsed and another fire {{broke out in the}} main top, but Amethyst was also severely damaged and at 03:30 her mainmast fell onto the deck from a combination of shot damage and stress in high winds. Niémens mainmast also collapsed a few minutes later. Both frigates had stopped firing at 03:25, as the confusion on their decks was brought under control.|$|E
5|$|For {{the climactic}} tanker chase, the {{producers}} used an entire {{section of a}} highway near Mexicali, which had been closed for safety reasons. Sixteen eighteen-wheeler tankers were used, some with modifications made by manufacturer Kenworth {{at the request of}} driving stunts arranger Rémy Julienne. Most were given improvements to their engines to run faster, while one model had an extra steering wheel {{on the back of the}} cabin so a hidden stuntman could drive while Carey Lowell was in the front and another received extra suspension on its back so it could lift its front wheels. Although a rig was constructed to help a rig tilt onto its side, it was not necessary as Julienne was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> off the stunt without the aid of camera trickery.|$|E
5|$|Greathead had {{originally}} {{planned for the}} trains to be hauled {{by a pair of}} small electric locomotives, one at each end of a train, but the Board of Trade rejected this proposal and a larger locomotive was designed which was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> up to seven carriages on its own. Twenty-eight locomotives were manufactured in America by the General Electric Company (of which syndicate member Darius Ogden Mills was a director) and assembled in the Wood Lane depot. A fleet of 168 carriages was manufactured by the Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Company and the Brush Electrical Engineering Company. Passengers boarded and left the trains through folding lattice gates {{at each end of the}} carriages; these gates were operated by guards who rode on an outside platform. The CLR {{had originally}} intended to have two classes of travel, but dropped the plan before opening, although its carriages were built with different qualities of interior fittings for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|Reno {{retired and}} focused on his art. Pike hadn't {{forgotten}} his vision though. He attempted to kill Warblade and managed to disperse Warblade's molecules with an explosion that also killed Reno's girlfriend, Jules. Reno was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> literally <b>pull</b> himself back together and wanted revenge. He tracked Pike to Sarajevo, where they fought again. This time Warblade won and he killed Pike and added the final insult to the dying Pike: even if Pike had killed Warblade, he would have failed his quest, because the WildC.A.T.s had been disbanded for months.|$|R
5000|$|In September 2003 {{the high}} school was {{completely}} remodeled, with 155000 sq ft added to the building. Facilities that were added include several wings and a performing arts center. A controversial portion of the remodel was the addition of eight 42" [...] flat screen TVs for the cafeteria, and the incorrect placement of the supporting wall of the South Gym, which prevents the bleachers from being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> be <b>pulled</b> out entirely during sporting events. The campus also expanded, with approximately 40 acre of new athletic fields and green space.|$|R

5|$|Hirst {{received}} little coaching as a batsman. Physically brave, {{he was often}} at his best on pitches which were difficult for batting, and when his team faced a crisis. His usual approach was to bat aggressively. Although he could play defensively if required, he preferred to attack when his team were in difficulties. He played a variety of strokes, but he favoured the on drive and particularly the pull and hook shots. He was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> and hook almost any ball delivered to him, {{making it difficult to}} place fielders effectively while he was batting. Only in Australia did this approach prove less successful. He also established a reputation as an outstanding fielder at mid off. In this position, he took many catches, often from hard drives in an era when batsmen played this shot very well.|$|E
5|$|In series five Adam hires a nanny, Jenny (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), to {{look after}} Wes while he takes part in operations. Midway through the series, she and Adam start a brief love affair, which ends in the {{penultimate}} episode. In the fifth series, particularly in its later episodes, Adam suffers from several mental breakdowns following the loss of Fiona. He has recurring nightmares that involve his being wounded and unable to return home to his son, and in the eighth episode, he has a panic attack after learning that Wes has briefly run away from home; this attack jeopardises his life during an operation. In the series finale, Adam is revealed to be suicidally depressed, wishing he had died in Fiona's place. But after another panic attack, he is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> through, save fellow officer Ros Myers (Hermione Norris), and escape from the Thames Barrier before they both drown.|$|E
5|$|Scully theorizes that Gates {{has brought}} Kevin to a {{recycling}} plant he owns in Jerusalem, Ohio. Mulder {{thinks that he}} has headed to the airport, as a man matching Gates' description was reported headed there. Mulder thinks Scully believes that she's been chosen to protect Kevin. Scully arrives at the recycling plant where Gates tells Kevin that he must die for the 'New Age' to come. Gates attempts to jump into a paper shredding machine with Kevin, but Kevin grabs onto the side as Gates falls into the shredder. Scully is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> Kevin to safety. Two days later, Scully and Kevin say goodbye. Kevin tells Scully he'll see her again. Scully goes to the confessional {{for the first time}} in years, wondering if God is speaking, but that no one is listening.|$|E

5|$|The {{pulling power}} of the Trait du Nord made it popular for use during the Industrial Revolution of the late 19th century in heavy industry, {{including}} mining. In mines, steam engines and internal combustion engines {{could not be used}} due to the possibility of a gas explosion. The first horses were used in the mines in 1821 and the Trait du Nord quickly became a favorite for hauling carts in the mines and operating the pulleys used to lift coal to the surface. Breeders worked to adapt the breed to mining requirements, and the breed became larger as more power was needed to pull heavier loads. Good horses were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> , usually around twelve cars worth, along a railway. As early as 1920, the usage of horses in mines began to decline as electric locomotives came into use, and in 1969 the last horse was removed from the mines.|$|E
5|$|Thrown into further {{confusion}} by {{the loss}} of Favorite, the French and Venetian formation began to break up and the British squadron was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> ahead of their opponents; the leading French ships Flore and Bellona succeeded in only reaching Amphion, which was now {{at the rear of the}} British line. Amphion found herself caught between the two frigates and this slowed the British line enough that the French eastern division, led by Danaé, was able to strike at HMS Volage, now the leading British ship after overtaking Cerberus during the turn. Volage was much smaller than her opponent but was armed with 32-pounder carronades, short range guns that caused such damage to Danaé that the French ship was forced to haul off and reengage from a longer range. The strain of combat at this greater distance ruptured Volage's short-ranged carronades and left the ship much weakened, with only a single gun with which to engage the enemy.|$|E
5|$|Tigre too {{turned away}} at about 12:00 and was again {{replaced}} by the third ship in the French line, Marat, which pulled alongside and battered the already damaged Alexander for an hour, taking damage in its turn. At 13:00, with his rigging and sails tattered, his masts shot through, hull shattered and several fires raging on board, Bligh surrendered Alexander {{in the face of}} overwhelming French odds as Nielly's division pulled within range and began to fire on his ship. Hamilton in Canada had been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> ahead of Nielly and escape, most of the French shot flying over the British ship: so ineffectual had been the attack on Canada that Hamilton reported no damage or casualties at all.|$|E
50|$|The player {{character}} is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> push and <b>pull</b> bricks, which the player must use {{to kill the}} enemies. An enemy can be killed by being crushed either by the player character or a brick falling down on it or horizontally between two bricks. On the other hand, the player character dies if a brick or an enemy falls on top of it. Enemies are unable <b>to</b> push or <b>pull</b> bricks. Some levels include water, which is fatal to the player character, but safe to enemies.|$|R
50|$|Spectacles or 'blinders' are {{pieces of}} plastic or metal shaped like opaque {{spectacles}} {{and attached to}} the bird's beak to block its vision. The devices are held in place either with a circlip which enters the nares or a pin which pierces through the nasal septum. These devices {{are based on the}} principle that by interfering with the vision of the bird, it is less <b>able</b> <b>to</b> visually locate the feathers of another bird and is therefore less <b>able</b> <b>to</b> grasp and <b>pull</b> the feathers.|$|R
50|$|Vettel showed very {{impressive}} pace {{in the early}} laps, building a 4-second lead within the first two laps and continuing to extend it at a second per lap. Hamilton was unable {{to keep up with}} him and was defending from Grosjean, with Kobayashi, Maldonado and Räikkönen all <b>able</b> <b>to</b> keep up. Hülkenberg dropped to 3 seconds behind Räikkönen and was kept busy in the opening laps keeping Alonso behind. The order stayed the same till lap 10 when Grosjean used the DRS to get alongside Hamilton before completing a move around the outside of turns 12 and 13. He was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> immediately <b>pull</b> away from Hamilton though Vettel was already 14 seconds ahead, but on a clear track he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> run laptimes that were within two to three tenths of Vettel's. On the next lap, Alonso passed Hülkenberg for seventh with a similar move.|$|R
