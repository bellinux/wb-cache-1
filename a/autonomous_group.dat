2500|$|The {{political}} geography of Ireland {{can be traced}} with some accuracy from the 6th century. At that time Ireland was divided into a patchwork of petty kingdoms with a fluid political hierarchy which, in general, had three traditional grades of king.

A tuath was an <b>autonomous</b> <b>group</b> of people of independent political jurisdiction under a rí túaithe, that is, a local petty king. About 150 such units of government existed. Each [...] rí tuaithe was in turn subject to a regional or [...] "over-king" [...] There may have been as many as 20 genuine ruiri in Ireland at any time.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{modified}} {{particle swarm optimization}} (PSO) algorithm called <b>autonomous</b> <b>groups</b> particles swarm optimization (AGPSO) is proposed to further alleviate the two problems of trapping in local minima and slow convergence rate in solving high-dimensional problems. The main idea of AGPSO algorithm is inspired by individuals' diversity in bird flocking or insect swarming. In natural colonies, individuals are not basically quite similar in terms of intelligence and ability, but they all do their duties {{as members of a}} colony. Each individual's ability can be useful in a particular situation. In this paper, a mathematical model of diverse particles <b>groups</b> called <b>autonomous</b> <b>groups</b> is proposed. In other words different functions with diverse slopes, curvatures, and interception points are employed to tune the social and cognitive parameters of the PSO algorithm to give particles different behaviors as in natural colonies. The results show that PSO with <b>autonomous</b> <b>groups</b> of particles outperforms the conventional and some recent modifications of PSO in terms of escaping local minima and convergence speed. The results also indicate that dividing particles in groups and allowing them to have different individual and social thinking can improve the performance of PSO significantly.
