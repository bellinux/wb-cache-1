40|$|It is {{well known}} that the oxygen uptake {{kinetics}} during rest-to-work transition (V̇O 2 on-kinetics) in trained subjects is significantly faster than in untrained individuals. It was recently postulated that the main system variable that determines the transition time (t 1 / 2) of the V̇O 2 on-kinetics in skeletal muscle, at a given moderate ATP usage/work intensity, and under the assumption that creatine kinase reaction works near thermodynamic equilibrium, is the absolute (in mM) decrease in [PCr] during rest-to-work transition. Therefore we postulate that the training-induced acceleration of the V̇O 2 on-kinetics is a marker of an improvement of <b>absolute</b> metabolic <b>stability</b> in skeletal muscles. The most frequently postulated factor responsible for enhancement of muscle metabolic stability is the training-induced increase in mitochondrial proteins. However, the mechanism proposed by Gollnick and Saltin (1982) can improve <b>absolute</b> metabolic <b>stability</b> only if training leads to a decrease in resting [ADPfree]. This effect is not observed in many examples of training causing an acceleration of the V̇O 2 on-kinetics, especially in early stages of training. Additionally, this mechanism cannot account for the significant training-induced increase in the relative (expressed in % or as multiples of the resting values) metabolic stability at low work intensities, condition in which oxidative phosphorylation is not saturated with [ADP free]. Finally, it was reported that in the early stage of training, acceleration in the V̇O 2 on-kinetics and enhancement of muscle metabolic stability may precede adaptive responses in mitochondrial enzymes activities or mitochondria content. We postulate that the training-induced acceleration in the V̇O 2 on-kinetics and the improvement of the metabolite stability during moderate intensity exercise in the early stage of training is mostly caused by an intensification of the "parallel activation" of ATP consumption and ATP supply pathways. A further acceleration in V̇O 2 on-kinetics, resulting from prolonged periods of training, may be caused by a further and more pronounced improvement in the muscles' <b>absolute</b> metabolic <b>stability,</b> caused by an intensification of the "parallel activation" as well as by an increase in mitochondrial proteins...|$|R
40|$|The {{interface}} stability against small perturbations of the planar solid-liquid interface {{is considered}} analytically in linear approximation. Following the analytical procedure of Trivedi and Kurz (Trivedi R, Kurz W. Acta Metall 1986; 34 : 1663), which is advancing the original treatment of morphological stability by Mullins and Sekerka (Mullins WW, Sekerka RF. J Appl Phys 1964; 35 : 444) {{to the case}} of rapid solidification, we extend the model by introducing the local nonequilibrium in the solute diffusion field around the interface. A solution to the heat- and mass-transport problem around the perturbed interface is given {{in the presence of the}} local nonequilibrium solute diffusion. Using the developing local nonequilibrium model of solidification, the self-consistent analysis of linear morphological stability is presented with the attribution to the marginal (neutral) and <b>absolute</b> morphological <b>stability</b> of a rapidly moving interface. Special consideration of the interface stability for the cases of solidification in negative and positive thermal gradients is given.
