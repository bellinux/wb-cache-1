Altogether 78 % of those contacted answered positively. In a logistic regression analysis including sex, age, smoking status, educational level, asthma duration and own opinion of the disease, the-adjusted odds ratio (OR) for nonsmokers wanting to participate versus smokers was 4. 0 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 8 – 8. 3). The cor-responding figure for patients with a recent asthma attack was 3. 4 (95 % CI: 1. 5 – 7. 6) compared to those without. For every 10 yr duration of disease the OR for wanting {{to take part in the}} <b>asthma</b> <b>school</b> increased by 1. 6 (95 % CI: 1. 0 – 2. 3). When analysing males and females separately, highly educated females were less willing to take part, while an opposite tendency was present in males. In conclusion those interested in taking part in an <b>asthma</b> <b>school</b> were characterized by highly motivated nonsmokers with long duration of disease and with a recent asthma attack, and not being highly educated females...|$|E
40|$|Background. For proper {{management}} of asthmatic patients medical personnel should have an adequate knowledge of asthma. This study presents asthma knowledge of physicians of different specialties and of medical nurses. Methods. The present study included 123 randomly selected medical nurses (60 of them finished the <b>Asthma</b> <b>school</b> educational course at University Institute of Pulmonary and Allergic Diseases, Golnik), 101 GPs, 41 pulmonologists, 62 pediatricians and 24 physicians of school medicine. Their level of knowledge of clinical picture, pharmacology, treatment, education and classification of severity of asthma were studied. Results. Pulmonologists had {{the highest level of}} knowledge of all studied parameters (72. 5 %) while the lowest total knowledge was found in general practitioners (62. 7 %). Medical nurses showed the modest total knowledge (53 %). Physicians mastered the best clinical picture of asthma (83. 5 %) and its prevention (79. 5 %). They knew less about the treatment (70. 4 %), pharmacology (61. 8 %) or education (69. 1). Physicians had a very low level of knowledge of classifying severity of persistent asthma (38. 3 %). Medical nurses, who finished <b>Asthma</b> <b>school,</b> had much greater level of knowledge (56. 7 %) than medical nurses with other additional education (31. 8 %) or without any additional education (30. 4 %). Self-management plan was found in 56. 4 % of pediatricians, 58. 5 % of pulmonologists and in only 23. 3 % of GPs. Conclusions. The level of knowledge of tested medical personnel was low, especially in GPs and school physicians. It is important to perform educational courses, as medical nurses, who finished <b>Asthma</b> <b>school</b> of University Institute of Pulmonary and Allergic Diseases Golnik, had much higher level of knowledge compared to other tested medical nurses. It would be obligatory to raise the level of knowledge of asthma of GPs and school physicians. </p...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Asthma, {{the most}} common chronic disease in {{children}} today, {{is the leading cause}} of absenteeism among students. It accounts for nearly 20 million lost school days annually. This study examined whether full-time (5 days per week) or part-time (2 days per week) school nurses would have a differential effect on the frequency of absences among elementary school students with asthma. This study found that students with asthma who were poor or who were African American and in schools with full-time nurses missed signi®cantly fewer days (3 days, or 23 % fewer missed days) than did their counterparts with asthma in schools with part-time nurses.

40|$|Abstract Background In well-child care it is {{difficult}} to determine whether preschool children with asthma symptoms actually have or will develop <b>asthma</b> at <b>school</b> age. The PIAMA (Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy) Risk Score has been proposed as an instrument that predicts <b>asthma</b> at <b>school</b> age, using eight easy obtainable parameters, assessed at the time of first asthma symptoms at preschool age. The aim of this study is to present the rationale and design of a study 1) to externally validate and update the PIAMA Risk Score, 2) to develop an Asthma Risk Appraisal Tool to predict <b>asthma</b> at <b>school</b> age in (specific subgroups of) preschool children with asthma symptoms and 3) to test implementation of the Asthma Risk Appraisal Tool in well-child care. Methods and design The study will be performed within the framework of Generation R, a prospective multi-ethnic cohort study. In total, consent for postnatal follow-up was obtained from 7893 children, born between 2002 and 2006. At preschool age the PIAMA Risk Score will be assessed and used to predict <b>asthma</b> at <b>school</b> age. Discrimination (C-index) and calibration will be assessed for the external validation. We will study whether the predictive ability of the PIAMA Risk Score can be improved by removing or adding predictors (e. g. preterm birth). The (updated) PIAMA Risk Score will be converted to the Asthma Risk Appraisal Tool- to predict <b>asthma</b> at <b>school</b> age in preschool children with asthma symptoms. Additionally, we will conduct a pilot study to test implementation of the Asthma Risk Appraisal Tool in well-child care. Discussion Application of the Asthma Risk Appraisal Tool in well-child care will help to distinguish preschool children at high- and low-risk of developing <b>asthma</b> at <b>school</b> age when <b>asthma</b> symptoms appear. This study will increase knowledge about the validity of the PIAMA risk score and might improve risk assessment of developing <b>asthma</b> at <b>school</b> age in (specific subgroups of) preschool children, who present with asthma symptoms at well-child care. </p...|$|R
40|$|It is {{difficult}} to distinguish at preschool age whether a wheezing child will or will not have <b>asthma</b> at <b>school</b> age. A prediction rule for asthma in preschool children might help to determine a prognosis and to study improvements in treatment and prevention. This review discusses (1) the {{development and use of}} clinical prediction rules, (2) the European Respiratory Society Task Force classification of wheeze at preschool age, (3) published prediction rules developed to identify preschool children who will have <b>asthma</b> at <b>school</b> age, and (4) recommendations to improve asthma prediction. Prediction rules are currently created more frequently, yet their clinical use remains low. The classification of episodic wheeze and multiple-trigger wheeze in preschool children shows conflicting results as to whether episodic wheeze and multiple-trigger wheeze differ in clinical features and has limited value in predicting <b>asthma</b> at <b>school</b> age. Clearly, more studies are needed to confirm this. Currently available prediction rules aiming to identify preschool children having <b>asthma</b> at <b>school</b> age are of modest clinical value. Prediction can be improved by more precise definitions and measures and, ultimately, by more knowledge of pathophysiologic mechanisms. In the future, biomarkers and genomic risk profiles to develop personalized medicine might further improve asthma prediction, treatment, and prevention.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Respiratory {{symptoms}} {{are common in}} early childhood. The clinical characterization of disease presentation and hence its likely disease progression {{has so far been}} proven difficult. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether exhaled nitric oxide (NO) could be helpful to distinguish between subgroups of nonwheezy and wheezy young children less than 4 years of age. METHODS: Exhaled NO was measured in 391 children (age 3 - 47 months) with nonwheezy and wheezy respiratory symptoms. Children were divided into 3 groups: children with recurrent cough but no history of wheeze (group 1), with early recurrent wheeze and a loose index for the prediction of <b>asthma</b> at <b>school</b> age (group 2), and with frequent recurrent wheeze and a stringent index for the prediction of <b>asthma</b> at <b>school</b> age (group 3). RESULTS: Children from group 3 showed significantly higher median (interquartile range) fractional exhaled NO (FeNO) levels (11. 7 [11. 85]) than children from groups 1 (6. 5 [5. 5]; P <. 001) and 2 (6. 4 [6. 5]; P <. 001). No difference in FeNO levels was found between children from groups 1 and 2 (P =. 91). CONCLUSION: Wheezy young children less than 4 years of age with a stringent index for the prediction of <b>asthma</b> at <b>school</b> age have elevated levels of FeNO compared with children with recurrent wheeze and a loose index for the prediction of <b>asthma</b> at <b>school</b> age or children with recurrent cough...|$|R

40|$|Important aims of {{the study}} were to {{investigate}} whether an educational program (the ‘Asthma School’) directed by a nurse led to improved knowledge of the disease, to improved self-medication and self-management and to improved self-rated functional status. A total of 32 patients (6 males, 26 females, mean age 43 years) was included. The following methods were used to collect the data before and one year after the <b>Asthma</b> <b>School</b> was completed, two study-specific questionnaires for collecting demographic data and measuring different aspects of the patients ’ knowledge of the disease and its treatment, monthly diary cards, lung-function tests (FEV 1) and the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) questionnaire. The main results {{of the study were}} an improved knowledge of the disease and its treatment, better self-management, i. e. more frequent use of the peak expiratory flow meter (PEF-meter) and use of inhaled bronchodilators on an as-required basis, fewer patients on sick-leave and a better self-rated physical health status. However, in spite of these encouraging results, the lung function was found to be unaffected, no pronounced changes in the use of asthma drugs could be found and the patients ’ need for medical care remained the same...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: To better {{understand}} {{what is known about}} the association between childhood <b>asthma,</b> <b>school</b> attendance, and academic outcomes, the authors reviewed published studies investigating this topic. Tables with brief descriptions of each study’s research methodology and outcomes are included. Research reveals evidence that rates of absenteeism are higher among students with asthma. The exact magnitude of absenteeism is difficult to ascertain. However, the studies have helped to identify characteristics of children with asthma that {{are most likely to be}} associated with the highest absenteeism rates. Some interventions to improve rates of absenteeism among school-aged children with asthma show promise, but it cannot yet be concluded that students who adhere to medical routines for controlling asthma will as a result increase their rates of attendance. Studies thus far have shown that there is either only a weak or nonexistent association between asthma and school achievement. Further studies are required to verify if certain subpopulations of children with asthma (eg, those with severe and ongoing symptoms, those with disturbed sleep, kindergarten children) are at higher risk for poor school achievement. (J Sch Health. 2005; 75 (8) : 296 - 312) Health professionals frequently remind educators ofthe correlation between children’s health and their academic potential. Such generalizations are not always accompanied by specific examples and more rarely accompanied by evidence. To clarify and quantify the relationship between healt...|$|E
40|$|Although {{one third}} of all {{preschool}} children wheeze, only half of these will have persistent symptoms {{and go on to}} have <b>asthma</b> at <b>school</b> age. Pathological changes characteristic of asthma, including eosinophilic inflammation and increased reticular basement membrane thickness, were evident in endobronchial biopsies from severe recurrent wheezers aged 2 - 3 years when compared with age matched controls. However, at the time of endobronchial biopsy it was not known which children would persistently wheeze and develop <b>asthma</b> at <b>school</b> age. The work of this thesis follows up this group of children, both preschool wheezers (n= 47) and non-wheezing controls (n= 21), aged between 6 - 11 years and establishes {{the presence or absence of}} <b>school</b> age <b>asthma,</b> relating this to pre-school airway pathology. Children (n= 51) were followed up at school age, and those who attended for the research visit (n= 39) were characterised in terms of atopic status, lung function (spirometry, lung clearance index) and airway inflammation (exhaled nitric oxide) at school age. Forty percent (15 / 37) of preschool wheezers had developed <b>asthma</b> at <b>school</b> age. Although increased airway smooth muscle is an established pathological feature of <b>asthma</b> in <b>school</b> age children, nothing is known about airway smooth muscle in preschool wheezers, hence airway smooth muscle, smooth muscle mast cells and reticular basement membrane tenascin-C were measured in the endobronchial biopsies taken at preschool age. Next, airway remodelling (increased airway smooth muscle and increased reticular basement membrane thickness) and airway inflammation at preschool age were related to the presence or absence of <b>asthma</b> at <b>school</b> age. Sixty two percent (42 / 68) of children had one or more evaluable biopsies for airway smooth muscle assessment. Although reticular basement membrane thickness and submucosal eosinophils were significantly higher in preschool wheezers compared with controls, they did not discriminate the children who developed <b>asthma</b> by <b>school</b> age, suggesting these airway pathological features may be associated with current symptoms rather than future asthma risk. In contrast preschool airway smooth muscle was increased in those severe preschool wheezers who went on to develop <b>school</b> age <b>asthma</b> (n= 8, median age 8. 2 [6 - 10. 4] years, median ASM 0. 12 [0. 08 - 0. 16]) when compared with those who did not develop asthma (n= 24, median age 7. 3 [5. 9 - 11] years, median ASM 0. 07 [0. 02 - 0. 23]), p= 0. 007. These data suggest that future studies investigating the mechanisms underlying the persistence of preschool wheeze and its development to asthma should have a primary focus on airway smooth muscle.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the sensitivity and specificity of the exercise challenge test in a cold environment, and a neutral environment, along with confirming the diagnosis of exercise induced asthma in athletes who had been previously diagnosed with exercise induced asthma. Ten subjects performed two separate exercise challenge tests (ECT's) on a treadmill, one in a neutral environment and the other in a cold environment, and they also performed one methacholine challenge test. The protocol used for the ECT's were designed to have the subjects perform at steady state heart rate at 8090 % of their predicted maximum heart rate for 5 - 8 minutes. After each of the 3 tests, spirometry values of FEV,, FEF 25 -, 5 %, and PEF were collected. When all 3 of the spirometry values decreased 20 % or greater from the pretest to posttest, the test was considered positive and the sensitivity and the specificity for the normal environment ECT was 50 % and 100 % respectively. The cold ECT reported a sensitivity and specificity of 44 % and 100 % respectively. When only 2 of the 3 spirometry values decreased 20 % or greater from pretest to posttest, the test was considered positive and the normal environment ECT sensitivity increased to 62. 5 %, while the cold ECT sensitivity increased to 75 %. In conclusion, a majority of athletes (approximately 70 - 80 %) can be diagnosed correctly through the ECT, but caution must be taken when using the ECT as the only test to diagnosis exercise induced <b>asthma.</b> <b>School</b> of Physical EducationThesis (M.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{outcomes}} of an education intervention for childhood asthma conducted by Australian Indigenous health care workers (IHCWs). Design and setting: Randomised controlled trial in a primary health care setting on Thursday Island and Horn Island, and in Bamaga, Torres Strait region of northern Australia, April 2005 to March 2007. Participants: 88 children, aged 1 – 17 years, with asthma diagnosed by a respiratory physician (intervention group, 35; control group, 53; 98 % Indigenous children). Interventions: Children were randomly allocated to: (i) three additional asthma education sessions with a trained IHCW, or (ii) no additional asthma education. Both groups were re-assessed at 12 months. Main outcome measures: Primary endpoint: number of unscheduled visits to hospital or a doctor caused by asthma exacerbation. Secondary outcomes: measures of quality of life (QoL) and functional severity index; asthma {{knowledge and understanding of}} asthma action plans (AAPs); and school days missed because of wheezing. Results: The groups were comparable at baseline (except for asthma severity, which was adjusted for in the analysis). There {{were no significant differences in}} the primary outcome (number of unscheduled medical visits for <b>asthma).</b> <b>School</b> children in the intervention group missed fewer school days because of wheezing (100 % < 7 days v 21 % of those in the control group missed 7 – 14 days). Significantly more carers in the intervention group could answer questions about asthma medication, knew where their AAP was kept (84 % v 56 %), and were able to describe the plan (67 % v 40 %). In both the intervention and control groups (before-and-after comparison), there was a significantly reduced frequency of asthma exacerbations, as well as an improved QoL score and functional severity index, with no significant differences between the groups.

40|$|Asthma is {{a chronic}} lung disease {{characterized}} by recurrent and intermittent episodes or attacks {{in which the}} linings of the airways swell, mucus blocks the airways, and the muscles around the airways tighten. During an episode, people with asthma experience tightness in the chest, difficulty breathing, wheezing, and coughing. Asthma symptoms occur when exposed to certain triggers such as pet dander, mold, dust mites, tobacco smoke, or wood smoke. Asthma symptoms can be controlled through appropriate use of medications and avoidance of identified triggers. However, poor management of the disease can lead to complications that result in poor health, hospitalization, and even death. The West Virginia Asthma Education and Prevention Program, funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is charged with 1) establishing a statewide network of key stakeholders and partners dedicated to addressing asthma; 2) maintaining an asthma surveillance system that identifies priority populations for intervention, directs program activities, and evaluates program effectiveness, and 3) implementing health promotion programs and interventions to reduce the burden of asthma in West Virginia. This report summarizes data from the West Virginia asthma surveillance system. It is an update to The Burden of Asthma in West Virginia published in 2003 and is the most comprehensive {{source of information about}} asthma in this state. The data presented in this report indicate that there are four populations in West Virginia with a high burden of asthma: 1) children, 2) the elderly, 3) adult women, and 4) West Virginians of low socioeconomic status.

Asthma prevalence was 24. 5 %. Teachers, school principals, parents, and children de-scribed how asthma was managed at school. Data from classmates of students with asthma showed that they had moderate {{to high levels of}} information about the disease. Data from teachers in-dicated the great need for practical instruction on how they might effectively support a child with asthma in the classroom and on the playground. Principals raised concerns about expectations for the functioning of school staff and implementation of school policies especially related to asthma emergencies. Parents reported a range of problems their children face at school. Data from children with asthma showed that 75 % believed asthma affected their schoolwork. Findings from this study should be useful to school personnel, health providers, and others who assist children and their families to manage <b>asthma</b> at <b>school.</b> Data suggest that making school nursing services available is warranted, given the impact of <b>asthma</b> on the <b>school</b> community.

40|$|Since asthma is {{the most}} common chronic illness in childhood, many of the {{problems}} associated with this condition will impact on the child 2 ̆ 7 s education. Because of widespread concerns regarding the management of <b>asthma</b> in <b>schools,</b> a subcommittee of the Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand, Asthma Special Interest Group, was convened to draw up national guidelines for school staff in order to provide optimal management of <b>asthma</b> in the <b>school</b> setting. We used current medical literature and the clinical experience of the authors who have dealt with children and adolescents suffering from asthma in the hospital, community and school environment. A number of issues had been identified, including; the availability of an asthma first aid kit; correct use of bronchodilator aerosols by puffer and spacer devices; and clear instructions as to when to notify parents and when to call an ambulance to the school. To provide optimal care of <b>asthma</b> in the <b>school</b> setting, the committee made the following recommendations: (i) improved guidance and training of school teachers and ancillary staff in appropriate asthma care; (ii) improved recognition by schools of those students with asthma; (iii) schools should encourage a policy of exercise for all students with asthma; (iv) asthma medication should be readily available at all times to those students with asthma; (v) the safety of school excursions and school camps should be improved by having available personnel competent in acute asthma management; a mobile asthma first aid kit; and by ensuring the student continues taking their usual asthma medications throughout the excursion; (vi) the early introduction of a 2 ̆ 7 lung health 2 ̆ 7 education programme for all students, with particular emphasis on asthma being encouraged.

Four basic models included non-invasive, easy-to-obtain predictors only, notably family history, allergic disease comorbidities or precursors of asthma, and severity of early symptoms. Eight extended models included additional clinical tests, mostly specific IgE determination. Some models could better predict asthma development and other models could better rule out asthma development, but the predictive performance of no single model stood out in both aspects simultaneously.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Changes in school absence and missed games and swimming lessons because of wheezing, and schools' policy towards management of <b>asthma</b> in <b>school.</b> RESULTS [...] Of 17, 432 children screened, 451 met the entry criteria [...] 228 in intervention schools and 223 in control schools. 152 (67 %) children in intervention schools visited their general practitioner, of whom 39 (26 %) were given a new diagnosis of asthma and 58 (38 %) had treatment for asthma increased or changed. Over the next academic year mean (SE) parent reported school absence due to wheezing fell significantly, but to a similar extent, in both intervention and control schools (0. 82 (0. 11) and 1. 09 (0. 21) weeks respectively). There was little change in school recorded absence or participation in games lessons and swimming lessons in either group. At {{the end of the study}} intervention schools were more likely to have improved aspects of management of <b>asthma</b> in <b>school.</b> CONCLUSION [...] The intervention resulted in a majority of children being assessed by their general practitioner and improved teachers' understanding and management of asthma, but it did not result in any appreciable reduction in morbidity...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of reviewTo provide {{perspective}} {{to the most}} recent evidence regarding the association between early weight gain in infancy and the development of asthma and atopy during childhood, and highlight the potential mechanisms involved. Recent findingsRecently, several birth cohort studies involving more than 25000 children have found a consistent association between early weight gain in the first 2 years of life and incident <b>asthma</b> during <b>school</b> age. Methodology differs substantially between the studies and complicates the establishment of definite conclusions. Specific mechanisms for this association have been proposed, including impairment in lung development and elevated levels of growth factors and cytokines associated with airway inflammation and remodeling. A limited number of studies indicate that early weight gain in infancy is also associated with recurrent wheezing during preschool age but not with the development of atopy. SummaryA consistent association between early weight gain in infancy and incident <b>asthma</b> during <b>school</b> age has been observed in several cohort studies. the identification of this modifiable risk factor for the development of asthma opens the possibility of preventive intervention. Additional studies are necessary to clarify the involved mechanisms and some pending questions, such as the influence of early weight gain in asthma phenotypes and severity.

40|$|Seven {{schools in}} the Lewes area were visited to {{identify}} which children were using inhalational treatment for asthma. The attitudes of the parents and schools were assessed, as was the children's skill in using inhalers. Five per cent of all children were receiving inhalational treatment with bronchodilator drugs. On average they had missed seven school days in the past year. The opinions of the parents about treatment appeared {{to be determined by}} the severity of the child's <b>asthma.</b> Most <b>schools</b> coped well with giving bronchodilators, though there was no real {{understanding of the nature of}} the disease or treatment.

40|$|Background: Childhood asthma {{represents}} an increasing health problem {{and is the}} leading cause of hospital admission and absenteeism in children with chronic disease. It also compromises quality of life, eventually contributing to disturbances in self-concept. Self-concept is a recent and global perspective of “the self” and relates to skills, self-image and self-esteem. Little information is available on this topic and there are no data from Portuguese countryside towns. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of <b>asthma</b> among all <b>school</b> children in the 5 th and 6 th grades in a Portuguese countryside town and to establish its possible correlation with absenteeism and self-concept. Methods: In April 2002, two questionnaires were administered in the presence of the researcher to a group of 950 children attending different schools. The children completed the internationally renowned questionnaires: ISAAC and the Self-Concept Scale by Susan Harter. Results: Our sample (n = 818) had a mean age of 11 years (10 - 15 years) and a male-to-female ratio of 1 / 1. The cumulative prevalence of asthma was 11. 9 % and that of active asthma was 8. 8 %; 63. 9 % of asthmatics were male and 36. 1 % were female. The mean age of asthmatics was 11. 34 years and 74 % had active symptoms. Comparison of this group of 97 asthmatic children with the remaining children revealed a statistically significant correlation between the presence of <b>asthma</b> and <b>school</b> absenteeism (global: p = 0. 04; gymnastics: 0. 05). Regarding the Self-Concept Scale a statistically significant association was found between the presence of <b>asthma</b> and <b>school</b> achievement (p = 0. 027), physical appearance (p = 0. 015), behavior (p < 0. 000) and self-esteem (p < 0. 000). No statistically significant correlations were found in social acceptance (p = 0. 289) or athletic competence (p = 0. 085). Asthmatic boys had higher self-concept scores than girls, except in the domain of behavior. Conclusions: Twelve percent of the population studied was asthmatic. In asthmatic children, absenteeism was higher and self-concept was lower for almost all domains, except social acceptance and athletic achievement, probably due to overprotection...|$|R

40|$|Wheezing is a lower {{respiratory}} tract symptom induced by various viral respiratory infections. Epidemiological studies have revealed the phenotypes of wheezing in early childhood which have different risk factors {{for the development of}} <b>asthma</b> among <b>school</b> age children. The major viral species causing wheezing in children include respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus and influenza viruses. It has been shown that the impact on the development of asthma is different between those virus species. Moreover, recent studies have also focused on the interaction between virus infection and other risk factors in the development of asthma, such as genetic factors or allergic sensitization. In this review, we summarize the previous findings and discuss how clinicians can effectively intervene in these viral infections to prevent the development of asthma...|$|R
