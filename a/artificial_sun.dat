40|$|International audienceWith the {{spreading}} of solar concentrating devices and <b>artificial</b> <b>suns,</b> {{it has become}} critical to characterize the incident heat flux at the focal spot of such devices. In this paper a new method that allows the determination of incident heat flux at the focal spot concentrating devices has been developed. This approach {{is based on an}} inexpensive experimental device and basic inverse methods which are used to compute a map of the incident heat flux. The experimental setup is made of a common steel screen and an IR camera. Starting at ambient temperature, the screen is exposed to the incident heat flux. The evolution of the screen temperature field over time is recorded using the IR camera. The inverse model then uses temperature data to compute a map of the incident heat flux. Results at moderate heat flux were validated by comparison with Gardon radiometer readings: the agreement between the two methods is very good. This method yields a high resolution map without the need of an external scaling factor which is mandatory in the method using a CCD camera. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|The TV series {{begins on}} S-1, a futuristic world whose wartime {{pollution}} has forced its occupants to live underground. Its emperor is assassinated by military fanatic Zeo Gattler and his followers, who frame {{the team of}} scientists who recently found a solution to their planet's environmental decay. Gattler's followers invade the head scientist's laboratory, killing the environmentalists and destroying their work. He loads the civilian population aboard a fortress, the Algol, and flies off to conquer a new planet. Angered by Gattler's devious actions, the lead scientist's son (protagonist Marin Raygun) tries to escape. Before he can, he is caught in the Algol warp drive and finds himself near Earth in the year 2100. When he sees a Martian colony destroyed by Gattler's Aldebaren Army, Marin joins the military organization Blue Fixer. His ship becomes part of Blue Fixer's mecha, the space warrior Baldios. Marin and the Blue Fixer team (Jamie Hoshino, combat pilots Jack Oliver and Raita Hokuto, researcher Ella Quinstein and commander Takeshi Tsukikage) defend Earth against Gattler and the S-1 force. The conflict ends when Gattler triggers a massive tsunami by melting Earth's polar ice caps with <b>artificial</b> <b>suns,</b> flooding the planet and killing millions. Blue Fixer is helpless to stop it, and Marin watches the waves in horror. They remove the radioactive core of the World Union submarine base, which threatened to contaminate Earth, transporting it to the Aldebaren fleet where it kills Gattler, his troops and Commander Tsukikage.|$|R

40|$|In environments {{where the}} ambient level of {{ultraviolet}} radiation is high to extreme all year, {{the factors that}} contribute towards incidental sun exposure warrant investigation. Interviews were conducted (n[*]=[*] 28) to explore North Queenslanders' perceptions surrounding the typical person who engages {{in each of the}} following sun-related behaviours: deliberate tanning, <b>artificial</b> tanning, <b>sun</b> protection, and incidental exposure. The data were analysed using principles of thematic content analysis with themes derived from the prototype willingness model. While tanned skin was viewed positively, both the deliberate tanner and artificial tanner prototypes were described negatively. Descriptions of the prototypical sun protector were positive, while descriptions of the incidental exposer were neutral. Participants described all four prototypes using personality descriptors, while physical characteristics were reported for all but the incidental exposer. The current research suggests that distinct prototypes exist across a range of sun-related behaviours and that the prototype willingness model may provide a useful framework for further exploration of incidental sun exposure. In order to reduce the prevalence of skin cancer in North Queensland, incidental sun exposure should be targeted. Future research should explore whether the nature of reported prototype characteristics can lead to the prediction of sun-related behaviours...|$|R
60|$|Here it {{is but a}} {{text for}} a further suggestion. But let us suppose that there does walk down this flaming avenue a peasant, of the sort called scornfully an {{illiterate}} peasant; by {{those who think that}} insisting on people reading and writing {{is the best way to}} keep out the spies who read in all languages and the forgers who write in all hands. On this principle indeed, a peasant merely acquainted with things of little practical use to mankind, such as ploughing, cutting wood, or growing vegetables, would very probably be excluded; and it is not for us to criticise from the outside the philosophy of those who would keep out the farmer and let in the forger. But let us suppose, if only for the sake of argument, that the peasant is walking under the <b>artificial</b> <b>suns</b> and stars of this tremendous thoroughfare; that he has escaped to the land of liberty upon some general rumour and romance of the story of its liberation, but without being yet able to understand the arbitrary signs of its alphabet. The soul of such a man would surely soar higher than the sky-scrapers, and embrace a brotherhood broader than Broadway. Realising that he had arrived on an evening of exceptional festivity, worthy to be blazoned with all this burning heraldry, he would please himself by guessing what great proclamation or principle of the Republic hung in the sky like a constellation or rippled across the street like a comet. He would be shrewd enough to guess that the three festoons fringed with fiery words of somewhat similar pattern stood for 'Government of the People, For the People, By the People'; for it must obviously be that, unless it were 'Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.' His shrewdness would perhaps be a little shaken if he knew that the triad stood for 'Tang Tonic To-day; Tang Tonic To-morrow; Tang Tonic All the Time.' He will soon identify a restless ribbon of red lettering, red hot and rebellious, as the saying, 'Give me liberty or give me death.' He will fail to identify it as the equally famous saying, 'Skyoline Has Gout Beaten to a Frazzle.' Therefore it was that I desired the peasant to walk down that grove of fiery trees, under all that golden foliage, and fruits like monstrous jewels, as innocent as Adam before the Fall. He would see sights almost as fine as the flaming sword or the purple and peacock plumage of the seraphim; so long as he did not go near the Tree of Knowledge.|$|R

50|$|Fearing more drones would come, Superman flies {{through the}} galaxy with a Kryptonian {{spacecraft}} {{in an attempt}} to track down Brainiac before finding his drones attacking a planet. Though he attempts to stop them, Superman witnesses Brainiac capture the planet's capital like he did with Kandor before firing a Solar Aggressor missile to consume the planet in its exploding sun. The explosion knocks Superman unconscious and he is brought on board Brainiac’s skull shaped, tentacled ship. Coming to in the examination room, he fights his way through the vessel before he discovers a room full of bottled cities prior to being attacked by Brainiac. At this point, confirming that he spared Krypton because of its eventual destruction, Brainiac is shown that he has been collecting information on all the planets he visited and uploading it into his neural core before destroying them. Using Superman's spacecraft and his telepathic abilities, Brainiac discovers that he has been living on Earth. Brainiac decides to chart a course to Earth while sending Superman into Kandor. Inside Kandor, his strength waning due to the <b>artificial</b> red <b>sun,</b> Superman meets his uncle Zor-El and aunt Alura. They explain that Brainiac was instructed to learn all that is knowable about the galaxy. Being a cyborg, Brainiac interpreted his directive literally and realized that he could not achieve this goal because life keeps changing. His knowledge of one world would become out-of-date as soon as he moved on to the next world. Brainiac therefore destroys civilizations after studying them so that they cannot change further, thus leaving him with a literally complete and up-to-date knowledge of them.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to shift the focus from a {{negative}} prejudice about immigration towards a much more positive evaluation. More and more the migration pattern changes from a blue-collar migration of low qualified workers towards a whitecollar mobility of highly skilled professionals. It has to be stressed strongly that - strikingly enough - most migrants are relatively well qualified. Just to mention a new IMF study (Carrington/Detragiache 1999 : 47), the US data show that immigration flows of individuals with no more than a primary education are quite small, and reach only about 500 ? 000 individuals {{out of a total of}} 7 million immigrants! ?For most countries, people with a tertiary education have the highest migration rate [...] . Thus, migrant to the Unites States tend to be better educated than the average person in their home (that is the sending) country, and the proportion of very highly educated people who migrate is particularly high? (Carrington/Detragiache 1999 : 48). So, these data clearly indicate that there is a substantial brain drain. Another question of quite similar importance is, why the US only should get a brain gain. Why not the EU? The immigration of highly skilled is crucial and decisive for growth and wealth of nations in the 21 st century. Once again this is clearly seen and strategically developed in the US. The USA attracts highly skilled people from all over the world because of a number of natural as well as <b>artificial</b> benefits (?<b>sun,</b> sea, and sand?, close relations between industry and universities etc.) and, therefore, experiences a ?Brain Gain? that stimulates growth. In the case of Europe, mobility is mainly intra-European, representing a ?Brain Exchange?. This is being fuelled by the Europeanisation of production and the creation of an internal labour market. However, the EU lacks the magnetic power to attract high skilled foreign scientists and to become leading centres of research intensive (service) production. For Eastern Europe there is a fear of a ?Brain Drain? that will not be directed towards the EU but rather towards the US...|$|R

40|$|Due to ever {{increasing}} global energy demand and depletion of fossil fuels, interest {{has grown in}} developing systems which can utilise the near limitless supply of energy provided to the Earth by the <b>sun.</b> <b>Artificial</b> photosynthetic systems mimic natural photosynthesis by using photosensitisers that absorb solar energy to generate high-energy electrons. These photoexcited electrons are passed to catalysts which drive reductive transformations to produce fuels and valued organic compounds. Sacrificial electron donors regenerate photosensitisers to complete the photocatalytic cycle. To date artificial photosynthetic systems are unable to fully mimic and reap the full benefits of natural photosynthesis as they lack spatially separating reaction compartments, and/or compartment-linking transmembrane electron transport chains. A model for the biochemistry that supports such transmembrane electron transfer {{is provided by the}} outer membrane cytochromes of Shewanella oneidensis MR- 1. In this Gram-negative bacterium, trans-outermembrane electron transfer to extracellular electron acceptors is performed by the extracellular cytochromes MtrC and OmcA acting together with the porin:cytochrome complex (MtrCAB), which provides an outer membrane spanning conduit that moves electrons from the periplasm to the cell surface. Liposomes offer reaction compartments which are separated from the surrounding external environment by a phospholipid membrane. Incorporation of MtrCAB in the membranes of liposomes containing methyl viologen facilitates transmembrane electron transfer from an external reductant to the compartmentalised electron acceptor. In this study the potential for MtrCAB proteoliposomes to act as a modular artificial photosynthetic system, which performs reductive transformations, was investigated. To explore this potential we have studied the ability of several photosensitisers to photoreduce: i) outer membrane cytochromes of S. oneidensis; ii) methyl viologen in solution and within liposomes; iii) MtrCAB in liposome membranes; and iv) reactive red 120 in solution and within (proteo) liposomes.
