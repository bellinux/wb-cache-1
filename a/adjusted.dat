50|$|Waulis design {{describes}} a crank device and an <b>adjusting</b> device of a combustion engine. The system <b>adjusts</b> the cylinder {{pressure of the}} motor {{in accordance with the}} required power. Adjustment of the cylinder pressure is achieved by changing the compression ratio by means of the <b>adjusting</b> device. The <b>adjusting</b> device moves an eccentric wheel to a set position using an <b>adjusting</b> wheel; this results in the connecting rod moving the piston to a desired distance from the cylinder head. The <b>adjusting</b> device measures the volume of the air entering the cylinder and <b>adjusts</b> the compression ratio appropriately. The <b>adjusting</b> device also takes into account the speed of rotation to <b>adjust</b> the compression pressure accordingly.|$|R

5|$|The Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 {{effectively}} made possession or {{transfer of}} marihuana illegal throughout the United States under federal law, excluding medical and industrial uses, through imposition of an excise tax on all sales of hemp. Annual fees were $24 ($637 <b>adjusted</b> for inflation) for importers, manufacturers, and cultivators of cannabis, $1 ($24 <b>adjusted</b> for inflation) for medical and research purposes, and $3 ($82 <b>adjusted</b> for inflation) for industrial users.

Selling marihuana to any person who had previously paid the annual fee incurred a tax of $1 per ounce or fraction thereof; however, the tax was $100 ($2,206 <b>adjusted</b> for inflation) per ounce or fraction thereof to sell any person who had not registered and paid the annual fee.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{inherent}} difficulties in accounting for inflation, several {{attempts have been}} made. Estimates depend on the price index used to adjust the grosses, and the exchange rates used to convert between currencies can also impact upon the calculations, both of which can {{have an effect on}} the ultimate rankings of an inflation <b>adjusted</b> list. Gone with the Wind—first released in 1939—is generally considered to be the most successful film, with Guinness World Records in 2014 estimating its <b>adjusted</b> global gross at $3.4 billion. Estimates for Gone with the Winds <b>adjusted</b> gross have varied substantially: its owner, Turner Entertainment, estimated its <b>adjusted</b> earnings at $3.3 billion in 2007, a few years earlier than the Guinness estimate; other estimates fall either side of this amount, with one putting its gross just under $3 billion in 2010, while another provided an alternative figure of $3.8 billion in 2006. Which film is Gone with the Winds nearest rival depends on the set of figures used: Guinness had Avatar in second place with $3 billion, while other estimates saw Titanic in the runner-up spot with first-run worldwide earnings of almost $2.9 billion at 2010 prices. The only other film that all sources agreed grossed in excess of $2 billion at recent prices is Star Wars; according to Guinness it has earned $2.8 billion at 2014 price levels, while other sources from 2010/2011 put its <b>adjusted</b> earnings at $2.2–2.6 billion.|$|E

The new balance <b>adjusting</b> system comprises motor-reducer, timing belt, screw pair, slider-guideway and four rocker force sensors. According to information obtained by the four rocker force sensors, unbalanced value {{at both ends of}} the big arm is computed and heavy block is moved to achieve balance <b>adjusting.</b> In this paper, motor power and torque to move the heavy block is calculated. In full load running progress of centrifuge, the stress-strain of screw pair composed by <b>adjusting</b> nut and big arm are analyzed. A successful application of the balance <b>adjusting</b> system is also put forwarded. The results show that the balance <b>adjusting</b> system can satisfy balance require of environmental test centrifuge.
