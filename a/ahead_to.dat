5|$|Along with Lou Holtz, Parseghian {{served as}} one of two honorary coaches in Notre Dame's 2007 spring game, an annual {{scrimmage}} held in April. Holtz's Gold team defeated Parseghian's Blue team, 10–6. The same year, Notre Dame unveiled a statue in Parseghian's honor by sculptor Jerry McKenna, depicting players carrying him off the field in triumph following the 1971 Cotton Bowl victory over Texas. In 2011, Miami also unveiled a statue in his honor {{to add to the}} RedHawks' Cradle of Coaches plaza. It shows him wearing a Notre Dame sweater as he kneels and looks <b>ahead</b> <b>to</b> the field.|$|E

By 26 August she was out of sight of land, and had entered the open waters of the Torres Strait between Australia and New Guinea, earlier navigated by Luis Váez de Torres in 1606. To keep Endeavours voyages and discoveries secret, Cook confiscated the log books and journals of all on board and ordered them to remain silent about where they had been.|$|E

5|$|In March 1695, Captain Juan Díaz de Velasco set {{out from}} Cahabón in Alta Verapaz, Guatemala, with 70 Spanish soldiers, {{accompanied}} by {{a large number of}} Maya archers from Verapaz, native muleteers, and four Dominican friars. They pressed <b>ahead</b> <b>to</b> Lake Petén Itzá and engaged in a series of fierce skirmishes with Itza hunting parties. At the lakeshore, the Spanish encountered such a large force of Itzas that they retreated south, back to their main camp. The expedition almost immediately withdrew back to Cahabón.|$|E
5|$|Looking <b>ahead</b> <b>to</b> {{the movies}} of February 2014, Chris Kirk and Kim Thompson at Slate argued that February's movies were {{statistically}} {{the worst of}} any month. Their evidence was the average RT ratings for all movies for each month between 2000 and 2013. February's averaged 45%, three points lower than January and September and four below August. February also had the worst month in the entire sample period, with the 2001 releases from that month coming in at 31%; 2010 and 2012 tied for the best February at 54%.|$|E

Kondo also brought his own Advanced force forward at maximum speed so that Junyōs aircraft could {{join in the}} attacks on the U.S. ships. At 08:10, Shōkaku launched a second wave of strike aircraft, consisting of 19 dive bombers and eight Zeros, and Zuikaku launched 16 torpedo bombers at 08:40. Thus, by 09:10 the Japanese had 110 aircraft on the way to attack the U.S. carriers.|$|E
5|$|The Assembly's {{first meeting}} {{began with a}} sermon by William Twisse in the nave of Westminster Abbey on 1July 1643. The nave was so full that the House of Commons had to send members <b>ahead</b> <b>to</b> secure seats. Following the sermon, the divines {{processed}} to the Henry VII Chapel, which would be their place of meeting until 2October when they moved to the warmer and more private Jerusalem Chamber. After their initial meeting they adjourned for about a week, as Parliament had not yet given specific instructions.|$|E
5|$|The attacks caught UN {{planners}} and troops by surprise. By August 26, the UN troops {{believed they had}} destroyed the last serious threats to the perimeter, and anticipated the war ending by late November. ROK units, in the meantime, suffered from low morale thanks to their failures to defend effectively thus far in the conflict. UN troops were looking <b>ahead</b> <b>to</b> Operation Chromite, their amphibious assault far behind North Korean lines {{at the port of}} Inchon on September 15, and did not anticipate the North Koreans would mount a serious offensive before then.|$|E

However, the film primarily focuses on the first eleven chapters of the novel, before skipping <b>ahead</b> <b>to</b> {{the end of the novel}} with the founding of Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. and the meeting with Forrest, Jr. In addition to skipping some parts of the novel, the film adds several aspects to Gump's life that do not occur in the novel, such as his needing leg braces as a child and his run across the United States.|$|E

5|$|As Minerve {{turned back}} towards the British convoy with the {{intention}} of cutting off the rearmost ships, Astell passed her more damaged companions to become the first ship in line. This left Windham, now at the rear, to face Minerve alone. Fortunately for Stewart, Minerve lost two topmasts as she turned to face his ship and had to pull away from the British to effect repairs. An hour and a half later, at 18:30, Bellone joined the action, attacking Windham directly. Victor supported Bellone and accompanied the flagship as she moved <b>ahead</b> <b>to</b> attack Ceylon and Astell. By 19:00, with Ceylon damaged so severely that she could no longer effectively sail or fight, third officer Tristam Fleming hauled the ship out of the battle line and ordered his crew to cease firing: Meriton and his second officer Thomas Oldham had both been seriously wounded by grape shot.|$|E
5|$|As a bishop, Baldwin {{came to the}} {{attention}} of King Henry II of England, who was so impressed he insisted that Baldwin become archbishop. In that office, Baldwin quarrelled with his cathedral clergy over the founding of a church, which led to the imprisonment of the clergy in their cloister for more than a year. Baldwin spent some time in Wales with Gerald of Wales, preaching and raising money for the Third Crusade. After the coronation of King Richard I, the new king sent Baldwin <b>ahead</b> <b>to</b> the Holy Land, where he became embroiled in the politics of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Baldwin died in the Holy Land while participating in the crusade; his long-running dispute with his clergy led one chronicler to characterise Baldwin as more damaging to Christianity than Saladin.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin and {{his group}} arrived at Tyre on 16 September 1190. Richard did not arrive in Syria until 1191. It is unclear exactly why they were sent ahead of the king; perhaps it was {{to look out for}} the king's {{interests}} while Richard took a more leisurely route, or perhaps to rid the king's entourage of a family grouping around Glanvill that the king did not trust. Baldwin was not a member or close associate of the Glanvill faction, so most likely he was sent <b>ahead</b> <b>to</b> look after the king's interests, whatever the reasons for the inclusion of his companions. Another concern may have been to get help to the Kingdom of Jerusalem as quickly as possible after the king learned of Frederick Barbarossa's death {{on the way to the}} Holy Land.|$|E
