Most {{of the neighbors}} are fascinated by Edward and befriend him, except for the eccentric religious fanatic Esmeralda and Kim's boyfriend Jim. Edward repays the neighborhood for their kindness by trimming their hedges into topiaries. This leads him to discover he can groom dogs' hair, and later he styles the hair of the neighborhood women. One of the neighbors, Joyce, offers to help Edward open a hair salon. While scouting a location, Joyce attempts to seduce Edward, but scares him away. Joyce tells the neighborhood women that he attempted to seduce her, reducing their trust in him. The bank refuses to give Edward a loan as {{he does not have}} a background or financial history.|$|E

It is speculated by adoption researchers, however, that the reasons given are incomplete: although such information could be communicated by a third-party, interviews with adoptees, who sought reunion, found they expressed a need to actually meet biological relations.|$|E

25|$|Fallen Fairies; or, The Wicked World, is a two-act comic opera, with a {{libretto}} by W. S. Gilbert {{and music}} by Edward German. The story is an operatic adaptation of Gilbert's 1873 blank-verse fairy comedy, The Wicked World. In Fairyland, the fairies <b>are</b> <b>curious</b> about wicked mortals, especially their strange capacity for love. They summon three mortal {{men from the}} world below to observe them and to teach the men how to live virtuously. The fairies {{fall in love with}} the mortals, become jealous of each other and behave badly. The men return to Earth, and the fairies realize that love is overrated.|$|E
25|$|Individualized {{learning}} was also integral to {{his theory of}} child education. He argued that the student combines information he already knows with what is learned, and forms a unique perspective on the newly learned information. Montaigne also thought that tutors should encourage a student’s natural curiosity {{and allow them to}} question things.He postulated that successful students were those who were encouraged to question new information and study it for themselves, rather than simply accepting what they had heard from the authorities on any given topic. Montaigne believed that a child’s curiosity could serve as an important teaching tool when the child is allowed to explore the things that they <b>are</b> <b>curious</b> about.|$|E
25|$|Large sharks {{species are}} apex predators in their environment, {{and thus have}} little fear of any {{creature}} (other than orcas) with which they cross paths. Like most sophisticated hunters, they <b>are</b> <b>curious</b> when they encounter something unusual in their territories. Lacking any limbs with sensitive digits such as hands or feet, {{the only way they}} can explore an object or organism is to bite it; these bites are known as test bites. Generally, shark bites are exploratory, and the animal will swim away after one bite. For example, exploratory bites on surfers are thought to be caused by the shark mistaking the surfer and surfboard for the shape of prey. Nonetheless, a single bite can grievously injure a human if the animal involved is a powerful predator such as a great white or tiger shark.|$|E

25|$|Kappa are {{not entirely}} {{antagonistic}} to human beings. They <b>are</b> <b>curious</b> about human civilization, and they can understand and speak Japanese. They may even befriend human beings in exchange for gifts or offerings of nasu (茄子, Japanese eggplant), soba (そば or 蕎麦, buckwheat noodles), nattō (なっとう or 納豆, fermented soybeans), or kabocha (カボチャ, 南瓜, winter squash), but especially cucumbers, the only food kappa are known to enjoy more than human children. Japanese parents sometimes write {{the names of their}} children, or their own names, on cucumbers and toss them into waters believed to be infested with kappa in order to mollify the creatures and allow the family to bathe. In some regions, it was customary to eat cucumbers before swimming as protection, but in others it was believed that this act would guarantee an attack. There is a cucumber-filled sushi roll known as kappamaki.|$|E
25|$|Barbara Wright first {{appears in}} the first Doctor Who serial, An Unearthly Child (1963), where she is {{teaching}} history at Coal Hill School in London in 1963, working with science teacher Ian Chesterton (William Russell). They <b>are</b> <b>curious</b> about their student Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford), who shows an unusually advanced knowledge of science and history, but a rudimentary knowledge of other subjects. In an attempt {{to learn more about}} Susan, Barbara and Ian follow her home to a junkyard, where they hear her voice coming from {{what appears to be a}} police box. During a confrontation with her grandfather, the Doctor (William Hartnell), Barbara rushes in to the police box, only to discover that its exterior hides the much larger interior of the TARDIS. After the Doctor reveals to Barbara and Ian that he and Susan are aliens exiled from their own planet, he tells them he cannot risk their revealing information about the TARDIS to their contemporary world, and dematerialises the craft against Susan's protests. At this point in the series the Doctor had no control over where or when it would land, making a return to London in 1963 impossible to co-ordinate. They are transported back in time to 100,000 BCE Earth, where they are captured by a prehistoric tribe seeking the secret of fire. Once they escape back to the TARDIS, their second trip takes them to the planet Skaro, where they encounter the Daleks for the first time. At the end of the first episode of that serial, Barbara becomes separated from her fellow travellers and is threatened by an unseen creature with a metal arm, marking the first appearance of a Dalek.|$|E
500|$|Labradors as a breed <b>are</b> <b>curious</b> and {{exploratory}} {{and love}} company, following both people and interesting scents for food, attention, and novelty value. In this way, they can often [...] "vanish" [...] or otherwise become {{separated from their}} owners with little fanfare. As a breed they are highly intelligent and capable of intense single-mindedness and focus if motivated or their interest is caught. Therefore, with the right conditions and stimuli, a bored Labrador could [...] "turn into an escape artist par excellence". Many dogs are also stolen. Because of their curious nature and ability to [...] "vanish," [...] along with {{the risk of being}} stolen, a number of dog clubs and rescue organisations (including the UK's Kennel Club) consider it good practice that Labradors be microchipped, with the owner's name and address also on their collar and tags.|$|E

500|$|The whale {{watching}} industry and anti-whaling advocates argue that whaling catches [...] "friendly" [...] whales that <b>are</b> <b>curious</b> about boats, as these whales are {{the easiest to}} catch. This analysis claims that once the economic benefits of hotels, restaurants and other tourist amenities are considered, hunting whales is a net economic loss. This argument is particularly contentious in Iceland, as it has among the most-developed whale-watching operations {{in the world and}} the hunting of minke whales resumed in August 2003. Brazil, Argentina and South Africa argue that {{whale watching}} is a growing billion-dollar industry that provides more revenue than commercial whaling would provide. Peru, Uruguay, Australia, and New Zealand also support proposals to permanently forbid whaling south of the Equator, as Solor (an island of Indonesia) is the only place of the Southern Hemisphere that takes whales. Anti-whaling groups, such as the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), claim that countries which support a pro-whaling stance are damaging their economies by driving away anti-whaling tourists.|$|E
500|$|The {{windows of}} the second-floor Long Gallery are divided by niches {{containing}} statues, an Italian Renaissance feature exemplified at the Palazzo degli Uffizi in Florence (1560–81), which at Montacute depict the Nine Worthies dressed as Roman soldiers; the bay windows have shallow segmented pediments– a very early and primitive occurrence of this motif in England– while beneath the bay windows <b>are</b> <b>curious</b> circular hollows, probably intended for the reception of terracotta medallions, again emulating the palazzi of Florence. Such medallions {{were one of the}} Renaissance motifs introduce to English Gothic architecture when Henry VIII was rebuilding Hampton Court and supporting the claim that the English Renaissance was little more than Gothic architecture with Renaissance ornament. At Montacute, however, the Renaissance style is not confined to ornament, the house also has perfect symmetry. Paired stair towers stand in the angles between {{the main body of the}} house and the wings that project forward, a sign of modern symmetry in the plan of the house as well as its elevation, and a symptom of the times, in that the hall no longer had a [...] "high end" [...] of greater state.|$|E

He charges Holly {{with the task of}} raising his young son, Leo (whom he has never seen) and gives Holly a locked iron box, with instructions that it is not to be opened until Leo turns 25. Holly agrees, and indeed Vincey is found dead the next day. Holly raises the boy as his own; when the box is opened on Leo's 25th birthday they discover the ancient and mysterious [...] "Sherd of Amenartas", which seems to corroborate Leo's father's story. Holly, Leo and their servant, Job, follow instructions on the Sherd and travel to eastern Africa but are shipwrecked. They alone survive, together with their Arab captain, Mahomed; after a perilous journey into an uncharted region of the African interior, they are captured by the savage Amahagger people. The adventurers learn that the natives are ruled by a fearsome white queen, who is worshipped as Hiya or [...] "She-who-must-be-obeyed". The Amahagger <b>are</b> <b>curious</b> about the white-skinned interlopers, having been warned of their coming by the mysterious queen.|$|E

2500|$|New Foundations, NF, creates and manipulates sets using {{a single}} axiom schema for set admissibility, namely an axiom schema of {{stratified}} comprehension, whereby all individuals satisfying a stratified formula compose a set.

Since the axiom of choice holds for all finite sets, the failure of this axiom in NF proves that NF includes infinite sets. The (relative) consistency of NF is an open question. A modification of NF, NFU, due to R. B.
