5|$|When Marge and the {{children}} arrive at El Chemistri, Homer unknowingly arrives at an illegal meth lab that he thinks is the actual restaurant. While the trio eat their meal (deconstructed Caesar salad) with other foodies, Marge feels guilty about misdirecting Homer. Meanwhile, Homer meets the meth dealer <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> addicts, whom he believes to be food hipsters. Just as {{he is about to}} have a taste of the meth (which he thinks is food produced with the help of molecular gastronomy), the police burst in and a gunfight ensues between them and the drug addicts. At El Chemistri, Marge receives a panicked text message from Homer requesting help, and she asks the other foodies to help save her husband. They refuse, so she, Bart, and Lisa head by themselves towards the meth lab after receiving doggie bags from the chef who is angry that they are leaving. After arriving, Marge throws apple pie from her doggie bag into the mouth of the meth dealer. This causes a flashback inside his mind to his childhood days when his mother used to make apple pie. With the help of this distraction, the police subdue him. After Marge apologizes to Homer, they and their children decide to have fun together as a whole family from now on.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the last}} {{published}} pieces by Ludlow was written for the New York Tribune, and published {{early in the year}} of his death. Probably prompted by his work with destitute opiate addicts, the article, “Homes for the Friendless,” advocated the establishment of homeless shelters in New York City, particularly for alcoholics <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> addicts, noting that the existing shelters served women and children only, and that there was a growing class of homeless men in need of assistance. The idea was enthusiastically endorsed in an editorial by Tribune editor Horace Greeley.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{high rate}} of suicide in alcoholics <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> abusers. The reasons {{believed}} to cause the increased risk of suicide include the long-term abuse of alcohol and other drugs causing physiological distortion of brain chemistry as well as the social isolation. Another factor is the acute intoxicating effects of the drugs may make suicide more likely to occur. Suicide is also very common in adolescent alcohol abusers, with 1 in 4 suicides in adolescents being related to alcohol abuse. In the USA approximately 30% of suicides are related to alcohol abuse. Alcohol abuse is also associated with increased risks of committing criminal offences including child abuse, domestic violence, rapes, burglaries and assaults.|$|E
25|$|Initial reports {{attributed}} the attack to the Gulf Cartel <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> gangs united against Los Zetas; however, authorities {{concluded that the}} violence was a factional feud within Los Zetas. Reportedly, the fourteen bodies dumped were henchmen of Iván Velázquez Caballero (Z-50 or El Talibán), a leader, whose faction was based {{in the state of}} Coahuila. They had been killed by a hit squad working for Morales (Z-40). One of the victims survived the attack by faking his death while the assassins stashed his body {{with the rest of the}} victims. He fled the scene and notified the authorities; reportedly, he stated that the alliance between El Talibán and Z-40 was over. It was later confirmed that the massacre was triggered by Velázquez Caballero's desire to leave Los Zetas and form an alliance with the Gulf Cartel to attack Morales' faction.|$|E

25|$|After the {{assassination}} of Luis Carlos Galán, the administration of César Gaviria moved against Escobar and the drug cartels. Eventually, the government negotiated with Escobar and convinced him to surrender and cease all criminal activity {{in exchange for a}} reduced sentence and preferential treatment during his captivity. Declaring an end to a series of previous violent acts meant to pressure authorities and public opinion, Escobar surrendered to Colombian authorities in 1991. Before he gave himself up, the extradition of Colombian citizens to the United States had been prohibited by the newly approved Colombian Constitution of 1991. This act was controversial, as it was suspected that Escobar <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> lords had influenced members of the Constituent Assembly in passing the law. Escobar was confined in what became his own luxurious private prison, La Catedral, which featured a football pitch, giant doll house, bar, jacuzzi and waterfall. Accounts of Escobar's continued criminal activities while in prison began to surface in the media, which prompted the government to attempt to move him to a more conventional jail on 22 July 1992. Escobar's influence allowed him to discover the plan in advance and make a well-timed escape, spending {{the rest of his life}} evading the police.|$|E
25|$|Age {{and genetic}} factors {{influence}} {{the risk of}} developing alcohol-related neurotoxicity. Adolescence, especially early adolescence (i.e. before age 15), is a critical and delicate developmental stage for specialised neuronal and synaptic systems mature. This critical developmental stage is where lifelong adult traits e.g., talents, reasoning and complex skills mature; however alcohol and in particular binge drinking may disrupt and interfere with this developmental process. Adolescence is also a period of development characterised by a high level of novel seeking, thrill seeking and risk taking behaviour and thus alcohol <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> experimentation and abuse is common. An adolescent rat study found that a relatively short exposure to high levels of alcohol resulted in long-lasting changes to functional brain activity with corresponding abnormalities in EEG brain waves that persisted into adulthood, including persisting disturbances in sleep EEG with a reduction in slow wave sleep. These EEG findings are similar to premature aging. According to one review of the literature, if the developmental stage of adolescence is similar to the developmental stage of the fetus with regard to sensitivity to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol, and if long-lasting or permanent damage to the brain occurs similar to what animal studies suggest, then this represents a major public health issue due to the high levels of alcohol use by adolescents. Indeed, alcohol can affect the remodeling and functional changes in synaptic plasticity and neuronal connectivity in different brain regions that occurs during adolescence (see this related article).|$|E

Some of it is stuff I should have said to my ex-wife. Some are things I've never said to the world." [...] Manson used his home as a canvas to document the disintegration {{of his relationship with}} Wood, writing the album's lyrics on walls and coupling them with paintings and drawings, as well as used condoms, bags of cocaine <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> paraphernalia. Much of the album's artwork was shot there.|$|E

2500|$|The High End of Low was {{recorded}} throughout 2008, with Manson recording vocals at his Hollywood Hills home studio between November and January 5, 2009. Produced by Manson, Twiggy and Vrenna with Antichrist Superstar and Mechanical Animals co-producer Sean Beavan, Manson described the album as containing [...] "extreme" [...] autobiographical content {{relating to the}} dissolution of his engagement to Wood, and as being [...] "very ruthless, heavy and violent". Its fifteen songs appear on the album in the order they were written. The penultimate track, [...] "Into the Fire", portrays the vocalist's mental state on Christmas Day, wherein he attempted to contact Wood 158 times, cutting himself with a razorblade on the face or hands for each corresponding attempt. The album's final song, [...] "15", was completed on Manson's January 5 birthday—hence the name. Manson utilized his entire home as a canvas to document {{the disintegration of the}} relationship, writing its lyrics on walls and coupling them with paintings and drawings relating to Wood, as well as used condoms, bags of cocaine <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> paraphernalia.|$|E

40|$|This thesis investigates {{secondary}} school students' {{perceptions of the}} efficacy of approaches taken by five {{secondary school}}s and one community Youth group on Auckland's North Shore, to reduce the use of alcohol <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>drugs</b> by Young People. Participating schools and a Youth group were also asked about their policies and procedures {{with regard to the}} use of alcohol <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>drugs.</b> Over the past two years the use of alcohol <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>and</b> the consequent behaviour of some Young People on the North Shore and elsewhere in New Zealand has attracted considerable negative public attention. Given the limited information on the efficacy of educational programmes on alcohol <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>drugs</b> in secondary schools this research seeks to make a contribution towards filling that gap. I have attempted to provide a snapshot, or case study of the current state of affairs with regard to some North Shore students' perceptions of the effectiveness of prevention programmes offered to them in the area of alcohol <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>drugs</b> education. An overview of the history of alcohol <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>drugs</b> education is followed by a review of the differing educative approaches directed towards combating the misuse of alcohol <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>drugs</b> by Young People. Theoretical perspectives and concepts within the field, ethical and political considerations, and current practices are also considered. The study concludes with research findings and comments on the efficacy of current programmes The methodology of this study is then described and the results of the research presented and discussed. The study concludes with a chapter which outlines recommendations which have arisen as a consequence of this study and includes suggestions, ideas and directions for future work. It is my intention, at a later stage, to provide a separate executive summary of the research which will include the approaches and findings of the research which will be specifically aimed at service providers and stakeholders...|$|R
