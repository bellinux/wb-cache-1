5|$|Across Britain, many hill forts {{fell out}} of use in the 100years {{around the turn of}} the millennium. It has been {{suggested}} that this, and the contemporary change in material culture of the Britons (such as the introduction of coinage and cemeteries and an increase in craft industries), was caused by increased interaction with the Roman Empire. The developing industries may have resulted in a shift away from the hill fort elites, whose power was based on agriculture. Such change is not as obvious in Dorset as it is in the rest of Britain, but there is a trend for abandonment of hill forts in the <b>area</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> proliferation of small undefended farmsteads, indicating a migration of the population.|$|E
