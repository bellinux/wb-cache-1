5|$|Indiana put further {{restrictions}} on African Americans, prohibiting them from testifying {{in court in}} a case against <b>a</b> <b>white</b> <b>man.</b> The new constitution of 1851 expanded suffrage for white males, but excluded blacks from suffrage.

5|$|Clarence Edward Smith {{was born}} on February22, 1928, and raised in Danville, Virginia, with his five {{brothers}} and one sister. During his childhood, Virginia was racially segregated, and he witnessed incidents of racism, including a fight between his father and <b>a</b> <b>white</b> <b>man</b> that was sparked by racial tensions. In 1946, he moved with his mother to New York City, where they settled in Harlem. He attended only two years of high school.|$|E

King was on the committee from the Birmingham African-American community that looked into the case; because Colvin was pregnant and unmarried, E. D. Nixon and Clifford Durr decided to wait for a better case to pursue.|$|E
5|$|The Wrestlers is an oil {{painting}} on millboard by English artist William Etty, painted around 1840 and {{currently in the}} York Art Gallery. It depicts a wrestling match between a black man and <b>a</b> <b>white</b> <b>man,</b> both glistening with sweat and under an intense light emphasising their curves and musculature. While little documentation of the painting exists prior to 1947, {{it is likely that}} it was painted over a period of three evenings at the life class of the Royal Academy.|$|E
5|$|Though {{research}} suggests William Edward White {{was the first}} African-American baseball player in MLB, unlike White who passed as <b>a</b> <b>white</b> <b>man,</b> Walker was open about his black heritage, and often faced racial bigotry prevalent in the late 19th century. His brother, Weldy, became the second black athlete to do so later in the same year, also for the Toledo ball club. Walker played just one season, 42 games total, for Toledo before injuries entailed his release.|$|E

5|$|Amid PCC/ZAPU's {{calls for}} various strikes and protests, {{including}} an appeal for black children to boycott state schools, Smith's Justice Minister Clifford Dupont had Nkomo and other PCC/ZAPU leaders restricted at Gonakudzingwa {{in the remote}} south-east two days after Smith took office. The politically motivated killing of <b>a</b> <b>white</b> <b>man,</b> Petrus Oberholzer, near Melsetter by ZANU insurgents on 4 July 1964 marked the start of intensified black nationalist violence and police counteraction that culminated in the banning of ZANU and PCC/ZAPU on 26 August, {{with most of the}} two movements' respective leaders concurrently jailed or restricted. ZANU, ZAPU and their respective guerrilla armies—the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA)—thereafter operated from abroad.|$|E
5|$|In August 1922, a {{traveling}} salesman named Jack Eaton {{was arrested for}} allegedly assaulting several young girls. The girls' parents refused to press charges, and Eaton was released. Later, he was captured by a mob, who cut him several times and poured turpentine into his wounds. An investigation found that the Scott County sheriff had willfully delivered Eaton to the mob, and Morrow removed him from office. Though Eaton was <b>a</b> <b>white</b> <b>man,</b> blacks were elated with the removal because they hoped it would encourage other jailers to step up efforts to protect against lynchings and mob violence.|$|E

She once again saved money from various jobs, purchased a suit for him, and made her way south. John, meanwhile, had married another woman named Caroline. Tubman sent word that he should join her, but he insisted that he was happy where he was. Tubman at first prepared to storm their house and make a scene, but then decided he was not worth the trouble. Suppressing her anger, she found some slaves who wanted to escape and led them to Philadelphia. John and Caroline raised a family together, until he was killed 16 years later in a roadside argument with <b>a</b> <b>white</b> <b>man</b> named Robert Vincent.|$|E
5|$|Longstanding racial {{tensions}} between {{whites and blacks}} exploded in five days of violence that started on July 27, 1919. On that hot summer day, on a segregated Chicago beach, <b>a</b> <b>white</b> <b>man</b> was throwing rocks at black swimmers in the water at a beach on the South Side which resulted in Eugene Williams' death. Tensions escalated when a white police officer not only failed to arrest the white man responsible for Williams' death, but arrested a black man instead. Objections by black observers were met with violence by whites. Attacks between white and black mobs erupted swiftly. At one point, a white mob threatened Provident Hospital, many of whose patients were African American. The police successfully held them off.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Sayers and Bears {{teammate}} Brian Piccolo {{became the}} first interracial roommates in the NFL. Sayers' ensuing friendship with Piccolo and Piccolo's struggle with cancer (embryonal cell carcinoma, which was diagnosed after it metastasized to a large tumor in his chest cavity), {{became the subject of}} the made-for-TV movie Brian's Song. The movie, in which Sayers was portrayed by Billy Dee Williams in the 1971 original and by Mekhi Phifer in the 2001 remake, was adapted from Sayers' account of this story in his 1970 autobiography, I Am Third. A notable aspect of Sayers' friendship with Piccolo, <b>a</b> <b>white</b> <b>man,</b> and the first film's depiction of their friendship, was its effect on race relations. The first film was made in the wake of racial riots, escalating racial tensions fueled by Martin Luther King's assassination, and charges of discrimination across the nation. Sayers and Piccolo were devoted friends and deeply respectful of and affectionate with each other. Piccolo helped Sayers through rehabilitation after injury, and Sayers was by Piccolo's side throughout his illness until his death in June 1970.|$|E

5|$|Reports were {{received}} in January 1849 that some Aboriginal {{people had been}} killed near Guichen Bay. On 19 February, the Protector of Aborigines, Matthew Moorhouse arrived in the district to investigate. He began his inquiries, assisted by a mounted policeman, an interpreter, and an Aboriginal guide. An Aboriginal witness, Leandermin, took Moorhouse {{to the site of}} the alleged crime. He told Moorhouse that he and <b>a</b> <b>white</b> <b>man</b> named Parker were walking along a road when they heard shots. He went to see what was happening, and from behind some trees, saw four or five Aboriginal women lying on the ground with fresh wounds. He also saw others on the ground, who he presumed were dead because they were not moving. Two white men were present, Leandermin identified Brown as one of them, and stated that Brown had a gun in his hand.|$|E
5|$|The Simpson County sheriff moved Dinning to Bowling Green and {{eventually}} to Louisville {{to prevent him from}} being lynched. Governor Bradley dispatched a squad of the state militia to protect him while his trial proceeded. Despite the fact that the case involved a black man killing <b>a</b> <b>white</b> <b>man,</b> most observers believed Dinning would be acquitted on grounds of self-defense. The jury, however, convicted Dinning of manslaughter and sentenced him to seven years of hard labor. Immediately, Bradley's office was flooded with requests for him to intervene on Dinning's behalf. The requests came from blacks and whites, some of them ex-Confederates. Dinning's attorney, Augustus E. Willson, formally requested a pardon, and Bradley issued it 10days after the conviction. Bradley opined that Dinning had acted reasonably under the circumstances and that it was a shame that no members of the mob were charged. After being freed, Dinning relocated to Indiana and hired ex-Confederate Bennett H. Young to file a federal lawsuit against some members of the mob that had identified themselves during his trial. The trial was held in Louisville, and Dinning was awarded $50,000 in damages.|$|E
5|$|In Robinson, Texas, Lucy Fryer {{was murdered}} while alone {{at her house}} on May 8, 1916. She and her husband George were English immigrants, and had become well {{respected}} in the rural community where they operated a farm. News of the death quickly reached the McLennan County sheriff, Samuel Fleming, who immediately investigated {{with a team of}} law enforcement officers, a group of local men, and a doctor. The doctor determined that Fryer had been killed by blunt-force trauma to the head. The local men suspected that Jesse Washington, a seventeen-year-old black man who had worked on the Fryers' farm for five months, was responsible; one of them stated that he had seen Washington near the Fryer house a few minutes before Lucy's body was discovered. That night, sheriff's deputies traveled to Washington's home, finding him {{in front of the house}} wearing blood-stained overalls. He attributed the stains to a nosebleed. Jesse, his brother William, and their parents were taken to nearby Waco to be questioned by the sheriff's department; although Jesse's parents and brother were released after a short time, he was held for further interrogation. His questioners in Waco reported that he denied complicity in Fryer's death, but offered contradictory details about his actions. Rumors spread after his arrest that he had been in an altercation with <b>a</b> <b>white</b> <b>man</b> a few days before the murder.|$|E
