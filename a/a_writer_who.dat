25|$|The Transcaucasian SFSR was {{dissolved}} in 1936 {{and as a}} result Armenia became a constituent republic of the Soviet Union as the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.

Any individual who was suspected of using or introducing nationalist rhetoric or elements in their works were labelled traitors or propangandists, and were sent to Siberia during Stalinist rule. Even Zabel Yessayan, <b>a</b> <b>writer</b> <b>who</b> was fortunate enough to escape from ethnic cleansing during the Armenian Genocide, was quickly exiled to Siberia after returning to Armenia from France.|$|E
