25|$|Mascis {{listened to}} classic rock {{artists such as}} the Rolling Stones and the Beach Boys, {{elements}} of which were incorporated into Dinosaur Jr.'s sound. In addition, Mascis was also a fan of many punk and hardcore bands such as The Birthday Party, and has frequently noted Nick Cave as an influence. Dinosaur Jr.'s members also combined elements of hardcore punk and noise rock in their songs, which often featured {{a large amount of}} feedback, distortion and extreme volume. When the master tape of You're Living <b>All</b> <b>Over</b> <b>Me</b> arrived at SST, the label's production manager noticed the level on the tape was so high it was distorting; however, Mascis confirmed it was the way he wanted the album to sound. To accentuate their use of volume, the band employed and popularised the quiet–loud change of dynamic in many of its songs, a technique that would be later popularised by Pixies, Nirvana and alternative rock in general during the 1990s.|$|E
500|$|Stefani {{frequently}} {{referred to}} her clothing line in her music, {{as one of the}} brand's promotional strategies. Stefani refers to her clothing line in her songs [...] "Wind It Up," [...] "Harajuku Girls," [...] and [...] "Crash" [...] (which even incorporates the brand's slogan, [...] "I want you <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>me</b> like L.A.M.B."). Stefani is often seen wearing her own designs, especially when making public appearances. [...] A thirty-second commercial directed by Sophie Muller was also released to promote the brand's fragrance.|$|E
500|$|He lobbied {{influential}} {{figures in}} Hollywood {{to fund the}} project and {{was reported to have}} recruited the aid of fellow Scientologists in promoting it. According to Bill Mechanic, the former head of 20th Century Fox, [...] "John wanted me to make Battlefield Earth. He had Scientologists <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>me.</b> They come up to you and they know who you are. And they go, 'We're really excited about Battlefield Earth.'" [...] This did not impress Mechanic: [...] "Do you think in any way, shape, or form that weirding me out is going to make me want to make this movie?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, Rachel; {{not on my}} account. What I've got to say {{should be}} said {{to you as well}} as to mother. It's <b>all</b> <b>over</b> between <b>me</b> and Mr. Prong." ...|$|R
500|$|Shirley {{replaced}} {{thousands of}} cymbal and drum hits with those used on previous recordings; the process took {{several days to}} complete. After recording the DVD, the band used a sprinkler system with diluted water rather than a bucket with blood that was like tar when recording the DVD. King later remarked, [...] "My guitar didn’t like it, {{that was the last}} time I played it," [...] and he donated it to the Hard Rock Cafe after the show. Vocalist Tom Araya felt the same and admitted; [...] "It was messy. I couldn't play because the initial dump at the beginning of the song got <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>me.</b> I couldn't hold my pick. I was slapping my bass trying to get sound out of it." ...|$|E
500|$|The new couple {{lived in}} Godwick Manor, their peace {{disturbed}} in 1776 when Wenman's health began to fail. He finally died on 10 April after [...] "a constipation which medicine could not remove", leaving Coke {{in charge of}} a 30,000 acre estate at the age of 22. Soon after his father's death, Harbord and other senior Whigs visited Coke and asked him to stand for Norfolk in his father's stead. Coke was not enthusiastic, not seeing himself as a politician and hoping to enjoy his new estates and wealth, but after his visitors pointed out a Tory might otherwise replace him [...] "my blood chilled <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>me</b> from my head to my foot, and I came forward". On 12 April he issued a manifesto to the Norfolk electorate, soon returning to campaign, and after being unanimously nominated on 27 April he was elected in May.|$|E
500|$|Watts {{then took}} a year off to travel, visiting Los Angeles and being {{introduced}} to agents through Kidman. Encouraged, Watts {{decided to move to}} America, to pursue her career further. In 1993 she had a small role in the John Goodman film Matinee and temporarily returned to Australia to star in three Australian films: another of Duigan's pictures, Wide Sargasso Sea; the drama The Custodian; and had her first leading role in the film Gross Misconduct, as a student who accuses one of her teachers (played by Jimmy Smits) of raping her. Watts then moved back to America for good but the difficulty of finding agents, producers and directors willing to hire her during that period frustrated her initial efforts. Though her financial situation never led her to taking a job out of the film industry, she experienced problems like being unable to pay the rent of her apartment and losing her medical insurance. [...] "At first, everything was fantastic and doors were opened to me. But some people who I met through Nicole , who had been <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>me,</b> had difficulty remembering my name when we next met. There were a lot of promises, but nothing actually came off. I ran out of money and became quite lonely, but Nic gave me company and encouragement to carry on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it, boy," [...] said Francisco, taking Mariano by the {{shoulders}} and kissing his forehead. [...] "Go thou; run! It is <b>all</b> <b>over</b> with <b>me.</b> God bless thee, my son." ...|$|R
6000|$|But Peregrine {{declared}} {{that he would not}} do this on any account. [...] "You do not know, Lady Staveley, what a fool I should make myself. It would be <b>all</b> <b>over</b> with <b>me</b> then." ...|$|R

2500|$|Immediately {{following}} {{the release of}} You're Living <b>All</b> <b>Over</b> <b>Me,</b> supergroup The Dinosaurs (featuring ex-members of Country Joe and the Fish, Quicksilver Messenger Service, Hot Tuna, Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane) sued them {{over the use of}} the name, prompting the addition of [...] "Jr." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paige {{returned}} to his hotel room. He recalled that the next morning, [...] "My stomach got sick with the pain that shot up my right arm. Sweat popped out <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>me.</b> The pain wouldn't quit. I tried lifting my arm. I couldn't. I just sat there, sweating, hurting enough to want to cry, getting sicker in the stomach and getting scared—real scared. My arm. I couldn't lift it." [...] He was examined by physicians in Mexico and in the United States; one expert {{told him that he}} would never pitch again.|$|E
2500|$|You're Living <b>All</b> <b>Over</b> <b>Me</b> was {{released}} in 1987; early copies of the record in the Boston area were packaged with the Weed Forestin tape, the first release by Barlow's side project Sebadoh. The album received much more attention in the indie-rock community than the debut. While the previous record had featured different musical styles for each song, You're Living <b>All</b> <b>Over</b> <b>Me</b> found the band's various disparate influences merging into each individual song. Although the hardcore punk influences were noticeably more muted than on Dinosaur, the overall sound was much more powerful, with the instruments often recorded very loud and with considerable distortion. While Mascis's guitar, alternating between Black Sabbath-like riffs, squalling solos, dissonant noise-rock and occasional quiet passages, was the main attraction, Barlow's bass, melodic, highly distorted and often playing thick two-note chords, competed for attention. Meanwhile, Murph played the Mascis-composed drum parts in a very heavy and powerful fashion, resulting in {{a version of the}} power trio format. [...] Mascis did most of the lead singing, in a detached drawl that presented a contrast with the extreme music. The songs were highly melodic, albeit with odd song structures that avoided the typical verse-chorus-verse patterns of most rock and pop songs. [...] Barlow also composed two songs: [...] the hardcore-influenced [...] "Lose" [...] and an acoustic sonic collage entitled [...] "Poledo" [...] that anticipated his work with Sebadoh.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, dear!" [...] The {{word was}} uttered {{with a low}} sigh. Then there was a pause, during which Lopez {{supported}} the sufferer. [...] "I {{thought that it was}} <b>all</b> <b>over</b> with <b>me</b> at one moment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tis <b>all</b> <b>over,</b> Jasper," [...] said he,--"'tis <b>all</b> <b>over.</b> Ah's <b>me!</b> Poor Sergeant Dunham has {{finished}} his march, and that, too, {{by the hand}} of a venomous Mingo. Well, we never know what is to happen, and his luck may be yourn or mine to-morrow or next day!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It 's too horrible," [...] Roderick went on; [...] "it has <b>all</b> come <b>over</b> <b>me</b> here tremendously! If I {{were not}} ashamed, I could shed a bushel of tears. For {{one hour of}} what I have been, I would give up {{anything}} I may be!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Bug {{was similar}} in musical style to You're Living <b>All</b> <b>Over</b> <b>Me,</b> with the {{contrast}} between the extremely distorted instruments and the melodic vocal parts intact, as was the band's unique blend of musical influences. However, this time out, there was even more melody and the song structures were more conventional. Mascis was exhibiting an even tighter control over the band's sound, singing lead vocals on all but one song and composing the parts for Murph and Lou to play. Barlow's only lead vocal was on the album's final track, featuring an overdriven, noise-rock backing track and Barlow screaming [...] "Why don't you like me?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Dinosaur {{recorded}} much {{of their}} second album You're Living <b>All</b> <b>Over</b> <b>Me</b> with Sonic Youth engineer Wharton Tiers in New York. During the recording process, tension emerged between Mascis and Murph because Mascis had very specific ideas for the drum parts. Barlow recalled, [...] "J controlled Murph's every drumbeat...And Murph could not handle that. Murph wanted to kill J for the longest time." [...] Gerard Cosloy was excited by the completed album, but was devastated when Mascis told him the band was going to release it on California-based SST Records. Mascis was reluctant to sign a two-album deal with Homestead, but Cosloy felt betrayed, [...] "There was no way I couldn't take it personally." [...] After the album's completion Mascis moved to New York, leaving {{the rest of the}} band feeling alienated.|$|E
2500|$|... "Many {{kids got}} killed because the Vietnamese are very good. Most of the Vietnamese {{soldiers}} had experience with Americans, and we didn't know that...And I became {{good friends with}} some of the kids, and in the battlefields sometimes they got shot in {{the left and the right}} from me, in the stomach and the head. Many times I held them, blood <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>me.</b> The worst feeling I had was that you can’t help them at all...I saw kids and adults got hit in the head, by the bullets, crawling. So I don't believe in crawling anymore. I just stood up and shoot like hell...I fought about two or three months. The thing that I couldn't take is to watch my friends dying every day. That's the worst feeling." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Richards, with a darkening face. [...] "Again attacked, and by {{the same}} hoss! Cota's hoss! Whether Cota was or was not knowin' its tricks, she was {{actually}} furious at me for killin' it--and it's <b>all</b> <b>over</b> 'twixt <b>me</b> and her." ...|$|R

2500|$|As {{of the end}} of the 2017 season, Sabathia has {{acquired}} 25 hits in 124 plate appearances, making him one of the more successful pitchers from a hitting standpoint. On one occasion, Sabathia hit a 440-foot home run on June 21, 2008, off Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Chan Ho Park. He commented later, saying [...] "I told everybody I was trying to hit homers today because I had two singles last year and everybody was <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>me,</b> saying I was a singles hitter. It was awesome." [...] On July 13, 2008, in his second game with the Brewers, Sabathia hit his second home run of the season off Cincinnati Reds pitcher Homer Bailey, becoming the third pitcher in history to homer in both leagues in the same season and the first since Earl Wilson did it in 1970 with Detroit and San Diego.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, the {{original}} members of Dinosaur Jr. released Beyond on Fat Possum Records, their first album of new material as a trio since Bug in 1988. [...] It {{was met with}} critical acclaim, rating an 8.4 from Pitchfork Media [...] and garnering positive reviews from the music press as a whole. It was considered somewhat of a sonic paradox in that even though it featured {{the original}} members who produced [...] "two records so drenched in noise they still sound like aural assaults decades after their original release," [...] sonically it resembled the major label releases of the 1990s in both production values and stylistic range. On the other hand, while the sound was not as extreme as the original lineup's 1980s albums, it did feature a much bigger, more unrestrained, and more live-sounding feel than their 1990s albums, though Barlow's bass was noticeably quieter than in the old days. [...] Barlow did make his mark on the music in other ways: [...] {{for the first time}} since You're Living <b>All</b> <b>Over</b> <b>Me,</b> he contributed to the songwriting. [...] The album went on to good commercial success, debuting on the Billboard 200 at number 69 its opening week.|$|E
2500|$|Jones {{became aware}} of Tammy Wynette because their tours were booked by the same agency and their paths {{sometimes}} crossed after Wynette's first minor hit [...] "Apartment #9" [...] in 1966, which was written by Johnny Paycheck. Wynette was married to songwriter Don Chapel, who was also the opening act for her shows at the time. The three became friends but eventually Jones {{took more than a}} passing fancy to Wynette, who was 11 years his junior and grew up listening to all of his records. According to his autobiography, Jones went to their house for supper and while she was fixing the meal Wynette and Chapel got into a heated exchange with Chapel calling his wife [...] "a son of a bitch." [...] Jones wrote: [...] "I felt rage fly <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>me.</b> I jumped from my chair, put my hands under the dinner table, and flipped it over. Dishes, utensils, and glasses flew in all directions. [...] Don's and Tammy's eyes got about as big as the flying dinner plates." [...] Jones professed his love for Wynette on the spot and the couple were married in 1969.|$|E

2500|$|The {{stewards}} {{investigated the}} collision between di Grassi and Félix da Costa but elected {{to take no}} action towards the Audi Sport ABT driver, and di Grassi spoke to Félix da Costa after the ePrix. Di Grassi claimed Félix da Costa [...] "didn't know how to race today" [...] {{and that he was}} passed [...] "very harshly" [...] but admitted that he had not seen the latter after overtaking him: [...] "That's the price of starting at the back, there's always these risks. That generated the crash and then this chaotic domino effect that really was a day to forget." [...] Félix da Costa blamed di Grassi for causing the collision, claiming the latter was [...] "out of character" [...] and did not believe that he would attempt such a manoeuvre. He added while di Grassi was intelligent, he steered earlier than expected which forced him to be squeezed into the wall: [...] "He was being very clever - I overtook him and he was staying there. But one lap to another his mind just switched, he tried to overtake me like 20 times in five corners. He was <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>me,</b> and then he was just trying desperate moves everywhere." [...] Di Grassi lamented the ePrix and said his team would forget about the event because of him going from being the fastest driver in the second practice session to having a poor qualifying lap and would recover for the next race of the season.|$|E
