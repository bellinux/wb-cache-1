50|$|The third current {{application}} of {{militarisation of space}} can be demonstrated by the emerging military doctrine of network-centric warfare. Network-centric warfare relies heavily {{on the use of}} high speed communications which allows all soldiers and branches of the military to view the battlefield in real-time. Real-time technology improves the situational awareness of all of the military’s assets and commanders in a given theatre. For example, a soldier in the battle zone can access satellite imagery of enemy positions two blocks away, and if necessary e-mail the coordinates to a bomber or weapon platform hovering overhead while the commander, hundreds of miles away, watches as the events unfold on a monitor. This high-speed communication is facilitated by a separate internet created by the military for the military. Communication satellites hold this system together by creating an informational grid over the given theatre of operations. The Department of Defense is currently working to establish a Global Information Grid to connect all military units and branches into <b>a</b> <b>computerised</b> <b>network</b> in order to share information and create a more efficient military.|$|E

The project is primarily targeted at the clinical moni toring of people suffering from schizophrenia and the system incorporates measures which can {{provide a basis for}} quality assurance of care and a clinically driven approach to audit. SafetyNet is being designed to help keep track of individual sufferers, chart their needs as they change over time, prompt the services to action and knit together the responses needed from different agencies. It is a modular system which can be adapted to the needs of people with different kinds of mental illness and to different community populations...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to study some women's {{participation}} in two different kinds of computerised further education organised as distance edu­cation. Both groups used the FirstClass conference system {{as a tool for}} bridging distances. One was a university program for teachers in special education and the other was <b>a</b> <b>computerised</b> <b>Network</b> for professional special education teachers, run by the members. The dissertation was grounded in feminist theory and in a socio-cultural perspective on learning. The empirical material consists of questionnaires, interviews and analysis of the communi­cation in both computer conferences. The result showed that the women appreciated the opportunity to study at a distance. They enjoyed the flexibil­ity in time and space and the opportunity {{to be a part of}} a fellowship. There were great differences in the pattern of communication and the contents in the two settings. In the Special Education Programme the communication was regular and the inputs were usually related to the literature and examina­tion issues. In the Network the communication was more sporadic. The in­puts were usually short and consisted mostly of information. The contribu­tions in both settings were generally univocal and usually they did not show that the individual participants developed new pedagogical perspectives or views related to the actual question. This investigation showed that it was difficult to establish discussions and co-operation via the computer, espe­cially in the Network. However the women were satisfied with the continu­ing education and felt that the written communication via the computer con­ferences developed their knowledge in special pedagogy and helped them to reflect upon their work as special education teachers. Distance education could however become a gender-trap as it was found to allow the women to combine unpaid work in the family with both paid work and studies. digitalisering@um...|$|E
50|$|Here L is the luminosity, ε is {{the nuclear}} energy {{generation}} rate per unit mass and εν is the luminosity due to neutrino emission (see below {{for the other}} quantities). The slow evolution of the Sun on the main sequence is then determined by {{the change in the}} nuclear species (principally hydrogen being consumed and helium being produced). The rates of the various nuclear reactions are estimated from particle physics experiments at high energies, which are extrapolated back to the lower energies of stellar interiors (the Sun burns hydrogen rather slowly). Historically, errors in the nuclear reaction rates {{have been one of the}} biggest sources of error in stellar modelling. Computers are employed to calculate the varying abundances (usually by mass fraction) of the nuclear species. A particular species will have a rate of production and a rate of destruction, so both are needed to calculate its abundance over time, at varying conditions of temperature and density. Since there are many nuclear species, <b>a</b> <b>computerised</b> reaction <b>network</b> is needed to keep track of how all the abundances vary together.|$|R

We use both simulated and experimentally generated data {{to test the}} determinants of individual behaviour in network formation. We …nd that approximately 40 % of the network formation strategies adopted by the experimental subjects can be accounted for as best responses. We test whether subjects follow alternative patterns of behaviour and in particular if they: propose links to those from whom they have received link proposals in the previous round; propose links {{to those who have}} the largest number of direct connections. We …nd that together with best response behaviour, these strategies explain approximately 75 % of the observed choices. We estimate individual propensities to adopt each of these strategies, controlling for group e¤ects.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] Dutch {{public health}} {{services}} are charged with collective preventive care for the population [...] care that should, by law, be based on epidemiological data. General practices potentially offer important data for this purpose, particularly since more and more use a computer. This study aimed to assess whether {{it is possible to}} obtain useful epidemiological data from this source. DESIGN [...] In 1990, the Rotterdam Municipal Health Service, in collaboration with the Erasmus University Rotterdam, started <b>a</b> <b>computerised</b> sentinel practice <b>network.</b> The main features of this and a specific small investigation are described. SETTING [...] The following institutions cooperate in the network: Municipal Health Service Rotterdam Area; Departments of General Practice and of Medical Informatics, Erasmus University Rotterdam; Rotterdam District Association of General Practitioners. PATIENTS [...] Data are currently collected from 20 general practitioners and > 40, 000 patients. In a specific project, the distribution of cardiovascular risk factors in different ethnic groups was compared. MAIN RESULTS [...] It was possible to build up a regional epidemiological registration system in this manner. In the cardiovascular project we found striking differences between ethnic groups. The risk profile for Turkish men, in particular, was less favourable. The health service also uses the system to improve cooperation between public health and primary health care (for example, in cervical screening, influenza vaccination). CONCLUSION [...] Computerised general practices offer great possibilities for research and for preventive activities in which public health care and general practitioners can cooperate...|$|R
