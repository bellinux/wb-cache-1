50|$|<b>Acentric</b> {{fragments}} {{are commonly}} generated by chromosome-breaking events, such as irradiation. As the fragment happens there is unequal divisions of such fragments. <b>Acentric</b> fragments {{can also be}} produced when an inverted segment is present in one member of a chromosome pair. In that case, a crossover event will result in one chromosome with two centromeres and an <b>acentric</b> fragment. The <b>acentric</b> fragment will be lost as explained above, and chromosomes with two centromeres will break unevenly during mitosis, resulting in one daughter lacking essential genes.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{centromere}} is {{the point}} of attachment for the mitotic apparatus, <b>acentric</b> fragments are not evenly distributed to the daughter cells in cell division (mitosis and meiosis). As a result, one of the daughters will lack the <b>acentric</b> fragment.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>acentric</b> factor [...] is a {{conceptual}} number introduced by Kenneth Pitzer in 1955, {{proven to be}} very useful {{in the description of}} matter. It has become a standard for the phase characterization of single & pure components.

50|$|Lack of the <b>acentric</b> {{fragment}} {{in one of}} {{the daughter}} cells may have deleterious consequences, depending on the function of the DNA in this region of the chromosome. In the case of a haploid organism or a gamete, it will be fatal if essential DNA is contained in that DNA segment. In the case of a diploid organism, the daughter cell lacking the <b>acentric</b> fragment will show expression of any recessive genes found in the homologous chromosome. Developmental geneticists look to cells and cell lineages lacking unpaired chromosome segments produced this way as a means of identifying essential genes for specific functions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Acentric</b> {{chromosome}} fragments {{may arise}} {{in a variety}} of ways. One way is that disrepair of DNA double-strand breaks can lead to symmetrical or asymmetrical chromatid and chromosome exchanges as well as chromatid and chromosome fragments. If DNA damage exceeds the repair capacity of the cell, unrepaired double-stranded DNA breaks may also result in <b>acentric</b> chromosome fragments. Another way eccentric chromosome fragments may arise is when defects in genes related to homologous recombinational repair (ex: ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51) result in a dysfunctional error-free homologous recombinational DNA repair pathway and causes the cell to resort to the error-prone non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair pathway, increasing the likelihood of incorrect repair of DNA breaks, formation of dicentric chromosomes, and <b>acentric</b> chromosome fragments. If enzymes in the NHEJ repair pathway are defective as well, DNA breaks may not be repaired at all. Additionally, simultaneous excision repair of damaged or inappropriate bases incorporated in DNA that are in proximity and on opposite complementary DNA strands may lead to DNA double-stranded breaks and micronucleus formation, especially if the gap-filling step of the repair pathway is not completed.|$|E

5000|$|The electrogyration effect linear in the {{electric}} field occurs in crystals of all point groups of symmetry except for the three cubic - m3m, 432 and [...] The effect proportional to the square of {{the electric}} field can exist only in crystals belonging to <b>acentric</b> point groups of symmetry.|$|E
5000|$|The electrogyration {{effect can}} be easy {{explained}} {{on the basis of}} Curie and Neumann symmetry principles. In the crystals that exhibit centre of symmetry, natural gyration can not exist, since, due to the Neumann principle, the point symmetry group of the medium should be a subgroup of the symmetry group that describes the phenomena, which are properties of this medium. As a result, the gyration tensor possessing a symmetry of second-rank axial tensor - [...] is not a subgroup of centrosymmetric media and so the natural optical activity cannot exist in such media. According to the Curie symmetry principle, external actions reduce the symmetry group of the medium down to the group defined by intersection of the symmetry groups of the action and the medium. When the electric field (with the symmetry of polar vector, [...] ) influences the crystal which possess the inversion centre, the symmetry group of the crystal should be lowered to the <b>acentric</b> one, thus permitting the appearance of gyration. However, in case of the quadratic electrogyration effect, the symmetry of the action should be considered as that of the dyad product [...] or, what is the same, the symmetry of a polar second-rank tensor (...) [...] Such a centrosymmetric action cannot lead to lowering of centrosymmetric symmetry of crystal to <b>acentric</b> states. This is the reason why the quadratic electrogyration exists only in the <b>acentric</b> crystals.|$|E

5000|$|A {{more common}} {{mechanism}} {{in the formation}} of isochromosomes is through the breakage and fusion of sister chromatids, most likely occurring in early anaphase of mitosis or meiosis. A double-stranded break in the pericentric region of the chromosome is repaired when the sister chromatids, each containing a centromere, are fused together. [...] This U-type exchange of genetic material creates an isodicentric chromosome. Misdivision of the centromere and U-type exchange can occur in sister chromatids, thus creating an isochromosome with genetically identical arms. However, U-type exchange can also occur for homologous chromosomes which creates an isochromosome with homologous arms. This exchange between homologues is most likely due to homologous sequences containing low copy repeats. Regardless of the chromosome involved in U-type exchange, the <b>acentric</b> fragment of the chromosome is lost, thus creating a partial monosomy of genes located in that portion of the <b>acentric</b> chromosome.|$|E

5000|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which mutations cause lethality in Diptera in the developing zygote are well documented. [...] The primary lesion leading to a dominant lethal mutation is {{a break in the}} chromosome, in this case, induced by radiation. When a break is induced in a chromosome in mature sperm, it remains in this condition until after the sperm has entered an egg. Following fusion, nuclear divisions begin, and a break in a chromosome can have drastic effects on the viability of the embryo as development proceeds. During early prophase the broken chromosome undergoes normal replication, but during metaphase the broken ends can fuse leading to the formation of a dicentric chromosome and an <b>acentric</b> fragment. The <b>acentric</b> fragment is frequently lost, while the dicentric fragment forms a bridge at anaphase leading to another chromosomal break. This whole process then repeats itself, leading to the accumulation of serious imbalances in the genetic information of the daughter cells. The accumulation of this genetic damage finally leads to the death of the zygote).|$|E
50|$|Typically, {{one knows}} {{two of the}} three state {{properties}} (P, Vm, T), and must compute the third directly from the equation of state under consideration. To calculate the third state property, it is necessary to know three constants for the species at hand: the critical temperature Tc, critical pressure Pc, and the <b>acentric</b> factor ω. But once these constants are known, it is possible to evaluate all of the above expressions and hence determine the enthalpy and entropy departures.|$|E

It {{covered all}} southern and east-southern {{parts of the}} old Pariou which remain visible and then forms a large trachyandesite flow to the east which covers the first trachybasalt flow. In Orcines, this second flow divides into two branches: one reaches the current location of Nohanent {{and the other one}} joins the Chamalières area, located at 8 km. This flow is estimated at 8580 years (± 350 years) thanks to radiocarbon dated wooden pieces.|$|E
50|$|For Class I, the {{proposed}} mechanism is that chromatid breakage occurs during mitosis, {{resulting in a}} chromosome fragment. That <b>acentric</b> chromosome fragment may segregate with the intact chromatid and result in partial tetrasomy; or, it may segregate with the complementary broken chromatid and result in partial trisomy because the broken chromatid may be saved by telomere restitution. In both cases, the inverted duplicated marker forms only after cell division and replication by rejoining the broken, replicated ends of the fragment. It is also suggested that U-type exchange during meiosis I may lead to partial tetrasomy.|$|E
50|$|Dicentric {{chromosomes}} are {{studied in}} model organisms such as yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The use of S. cerevisiae as a classical genetic system {{dates back to}} the 1950's due to its feasibility in transformation by recombinant DNA. Broken chromosomes that lead to <b>acentric</b> and dicentric fragments can be studied in S. cerevisiae due to its known ability to tolerate aneuploidy, an abnormal number of chromosomes. Strains of S. cerevisiae that tolerate aneuploidy can stabilize products of broken chromosomes during proliferation, which can be recovered and studied in a laboratory setting.|$|E
