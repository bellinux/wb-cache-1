5|$|White Southern Rhodesian women {{served in}} the war with <b>auxiliary</b> female units, in far greater numbers than in World War I. The Southern Rhodesian {{government}} set up three women's services: the Women's Auxilitary Volunteers (WAV), the Women's <b>Auxiliary</b> Air Service (WAAS), the Women's <b>Auxiliary</b> Military Service (WAMS) and the Women's <b>Auxiliary</b> Police Service (WAPS). Most Southern Rhodesian servicewomen served domestically within these organisations, while some went to East Africa with the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry.|$|E
5|$|A minimum term {{of service}} of 25 years was established, {{at the end}} of which the {{retiring}} <b>auxiliary</b> soldier, and all his children, were awarded Roman citizenship. This is deduced from the fact that the first known Roman military diplomas date from the time of Claudius. This was a folding bronze tablet engraved with the details of the soldier's service record, which he could use to prove his citizenship. Claudius also decreed that prefects of <b>auxiliary</b> regiments must all be of equestrian rank, thus excluding centurions from such commands. The fact that <b>auxiliary</b> commanders were now all of the same social rank as most tribuni militum, (military tribunes, a legion's senior staff officers, all of whom only one, the tribunus laticlavius, was of the higher senatorial rank), probably indicates that auxilia now enjoyed greater prestige. Indigenous chiefs continued to command some <b>auxiliary</b> regiments, and were probably granted equestrian rank for the purpose. It is also likely that <b>auxiliary</b> pay was standardised at this time, but we only have estimates for the Julio-Claudian period.|$|E
5|$|<b>Auxiliary</b> uniform, armour, {{weapons and}} {{equipment}} were probably standardised {{by the end}} of the Julio-Claudian period. <b>Auxiliary</b> equipment was broadly similar to that of the legions (see Section 2.1 below for possible differences in armour). By 68AD, there was little difference between most <b>auxiliary</b> infantry and their legionary counterparts in equipment, training and fighting capability. The main difference was that auxilia contained combat cavalry, both heavy and light, and other specialized units that legions lacked.|$|E
50|$|Asymmetric stereoinduction can be {{achieved}} {{with the use of}} chiral <b>auxiliaries.</b> Chiral <b>auxiliaries</b> may be reversibly attached to the substrate, inducing a diastereoselective reaction prior to cleavage, overall producing an enantioselective process.

5|$|Claudius {{annexed to}} the empire three regions that became {{important}} sources of <b>auxiliary</b> recruits: Britannia (43AD), {{and the former}} client kingdoms of Mauretania (44) and Thracia (46). The latter became as important as Illyria {{as a source of}} <b>auxiliary</b> recruits, especially cavalry and archers. Britain in mid-2nd century contained the largest number of <b>auxiliary</b> regiments in any single province: about 60 out of about 400 (15%). By the rule of Nero (54–68), <b>auxiliary</b> numbers may have reached, by one estimate, about 200,000 men, implying about 400 regiments.|$|E

5|$|Each legion was {{normally}} {{partnered with}} an approximately {{equal number of}} allied (non-Roman) auxiliae troops. The addition of allied troops to the Roman army was a formalisation of the earlier arrangement of using light troops from the Socii and Latini, who had received Roman citizenship after the Social War. <b>Auxiliary</b> troops could be formed from either <b>auxiliary</b> light cavalry known as alae, <b>auxiliary</b> light infantry known as cohors auxiliae, or a flexible mixture of the two known as cohors equitata. Cavalry types included mounted archers (Latin: sagittarii) and heavy shock cavalry (Latin: cataphracti or clibanarii). Infantry could be armed with bows, slings, throwing spears, long swords, or thrusting spears. <b>Auxiliary</b> units were originally led by their own chiefs, and, in this period, their internal organisation was left to their commanders.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} lexical-semantic {{properties of}} verbs, adjectives and <b>auxiliaries</b> appearing in adnominal clauses {{in comparison with}} those in final-attributives（sentences ending in adnominal form）in colloquial Heian Japanese. It is revealed {{that there is a}} certain correlation between the lexical semantics and the syntax of adnominal-ending form. The specific findings are as follows:（１）In adnominal clauses verbs of motion/change, verbs of emotion/thought/perception and verbs of existence are most frequent, in descending order, while in final-attributives verbs of emotion/thought/perception, verbs of motion/change, and verbs of existence are most frequent, in descending order. （２）In adnominal clauses all adjectives types（emotional, attributive and intermediate）are found, while in final-attributives only emotional（often with negative connotation）adjectives are used. （３）No particular correlations are found between the frequency and the lexical meanings of <b>auxiliaries</b> in adnominal clauses. In final-attributives, emotion/thought <b>auxiliaries,</b> past/perfective <b>auxiliaries,</b> inference <b>auxiliaries,</b> negative <b>auxiliaries,</b> assertive <b>auxiliaries</b> are most frequent, in descending order...|$|R

5|$|English syntax {{relies on}} <b>auxiliary</b> verbs for many {{functions}} including {{the expression of}} tense, aspect and mood. <b>Auxiliary</b> verbs form main clauses, and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of the <b>auxiliary</b> verb. For example, in the sentence the dog did not find its bone, the clause find its bone is the complement of the negated verb did not. Subject–auxiliary inversion is used in many constructions, including focus, negation, and interrogative constructions.|$|E

40|$|Learners of English often face {{difficulty}} {{in finding the}} exact way of using the future <b>auxiliaries</b> will, shall and be going to.

The aim of my thesis is to help learners of English clarify the main aspects of the use of these <b>auxiliaries.</b> First and foremost, I would like {{to call attention to the}} historical aspects of analysing will, shall and be going to. Following that, the relation of these <b>auxiliaries</b> will be investigated with respect to tense markers and modal <b>auxiliaries,</b> mainly from a syntactic perspective. In the next chapter, the main semantic fields will be covered with the help of a gradience between the modality and the future usage of all three <b>auxiliaries.</b> In the final section of my thesis, I would like to explain some of the observations I have found or made myself.

50|$|Hawaiian Creole English is a creole {{language}} most {{of whose}} vocabulary, but not grammar, {{is drawn from}} English. As is generally the case with creole languages, it is an isolating language and modality is typically indicated {{by the use of}} invariant pre-verbal <b>auxiliaries.</b> The invariance of the modal <b>auxiliaries</b> to person, number, and tense makes them analogous to modal <b>auxiliaries</b> in English. However, as in most creoles the main verbs are also invariant; the <b>auxiliaries</b> are distinguished by their use in combination with (followed by) a main verb.|$|R

5|$|There is no {{evidence}} that <b>auxiliary</b> infantry fought in a looser order than legionaries.

This was a tradition inherited from the Republic, when the precursors of <b>auxiliary</b> cohortes, the Latin alae, occupied the same position in the line. The flanks of the line required equal, if not greater, skill to hold as the centre.|$|E

40|$|The {{status of}} children’s {{acquisition}} of grammatical categories {{and in particular}} of <b>auxiliaries</b> continues to be debated. On the one hand, a number of corpus studies suggest that <b>auxiliaries</b> and similar categories are absent early on (e. g., Wijnen 1996 / 1997, Schlyter 2003). On the other hand, experimental studies indicate that syntactic competence for functional categories is available to toddlers and even infants (e. g., Gerken 2 ̆ 6 McIntosh 1993, Santelmann 2 ̆ 6 Jusczyk 1998). This study investigates the acquisition of <b>auxiliaries</b> in child French and evaluates these two perspectives using a new corpus of over 5000 child utterances containing cross-sectional speech samples from 18 children, ages 1; 11 – 2; 11. Subjects were presented with a standardized set of props and questions designed to trigger utterances with verbs and <b>auxiliaries.</b> Data collection and analysis involved an innovative digital recording set-up, digital transcription technology and editing software, and more detailed data analysis, including spectrograms. The results reveal that <b>auxiliaries</b> and modals are evidenced in all children from the earliest ages. Children produce a variety of auxiliary/modal forms: full <b>auxiliaries,</b> phonetically and phonologically reduced <b>auxiliaries,</b> “filler” vowels standing for <b>auxiliaries,</b> as well as subject agreement markers that precede nonfinite verbs and that implicate {{the presence of a}} finite auxiliary/modal.
