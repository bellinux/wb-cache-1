2500|$|Luc Despins, the {{creditors}} committee counsel, said: [...] "The reason we're not objecting is really {{based on the}} lack of a viable alternative. We did not support the transaction because there had not been enough time to properly review it." [...] In the <b>amended</b> <b>agreement,</b> Barclays would absorb US$47.4billion in securities and assume US$45.5billion in trading liabilities. Lehman's attorney Harvey R. Miller of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, said [...] "the purchase price for the real estate components of the deal would be US$1.29billion, including US$960million for Lehman's New York headquarters and US$330million for two New Jersey data centres. Lehman's original estimate valued its headquarters at US$1.02billion but an appraisal from CB Richard Ellis this week valued it at US$900million." [...] Further, Barclays will not acquire Lehman's Eagle Energy unit, but will have entities known as Lehman Brothers Canada Inc, Lehman Brothers Sudamerica, Lehman Brothers Uruguay and its Private Investment Management business for high-net-worth individuals. Finally, Lehman will retain US$20billion of securities assets in Lehman Brothers Inc that are not being transferred to Barclays. Barclays had a potential liability of US$2.5billion to be paid as severance, if it chooses not to retain some Lehman employees beyond the guaranteed 90 days.|$|E

50|$|Helliwell et al.

According to Helliwell et al., under the NEP, industry was in fact not significantly exposed to the declining global oil prices but rather the largest part of direct revenue losses accrued to governments, meaning that the industry operated throughout the period of the NEP under relatively similar oil prices, the 'made-in-Canada' price of oil (see item (a) in National Energy Program Details, above).|$|R

40|$|A central {{institution}} of US trade policy is Fast-Track Authority (FTA), by which Congress commits not to <b>amend</b> a trade <b>agreement</b> that {{is presented to}} it for ratification, but to subject the agreement to an up-or-down vote. We offer a new interpretation of FTA based on a hold-up problem. If the US government negotiates a trade agreement {{with the government of}} a smaller economy, as the negotiations proceed, businesses in the partner economy, anticipating the opening of the US market to their goods, may make sunk investments {{to take advantage of the}} US market, such as quality upgrades to meet the expectations of the demanding US consumer. As a result, when the time comes for ratification of the agreement, the partner economy will be locked in to the US market in a way it was not previously. At this point, if Congress is able to <b>amend</b> the <b>agreement,</b> the partner country has less bargaining power than it did ex ante, and so Congress can make changes that are adverse to the partner. As a result, if the US wants to convince such a partner country to negotiate a trade deal, it must first commit not to <b>amend</b> the <b>agreement</b> ex post. In this situation, FTA is Pareto-improving...|$|R
