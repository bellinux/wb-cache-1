Shrewsbury cakes (or biscuits) are {{typically}} crisp and brittle creations that may incorporate fruit. They can be small in size for serving several at <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> <b>or</b> large for serving as a dessert in their own right. Traditionally Shrewsbury cakes have a distinct hint of lemon.|$|E
5|$|Aventicum (Avenches) {{was likely}} {{the capital of}} the Helvetii since its {{founding}} {{at the beginning of the}} 1st century. In the 40s, it benefited from the traffic brought over the St Bernard pass over a street expanded by Claudius, and in 71 it acquired the status of a Roman colony and of an allied city. This is believed to have been a favor of Vespasian for the city in which he had lived for <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> <b>or</b> a measure to better control the Helvetii after the events of 69 by implanting a colony of veterans in their midst.|$|E
5|$|Between every down, {{the player}} selects a formation, play and, on defense, {{coverage}} shell from a menu. The game contains fifty-five offensive plays and seventy-one defensive plays, such as screen and play-action passes, blitzes and man-to-man defense. During a down, the player may control one team member at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>or</b> allow {{the entire team}} to execute a play automatically. On offense, depending on the play, the player controls the quarterback, running back or kicker. After a pass, control automatically changes to the ball receiver. On defense, the player may at any time switch control between any members of the team. Instant replay is available to review plays.|$|E

5|$|Certain weapons can be dual-wielded, {{allowing}} the player to trade accuracy, {{the use of}} grenades and melee attacks for raw firepower. The player can carry two weapons at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> (<b>or</b> three if dual-wielding; one weapon remains holstered), with each weapon having advantages and disadvantages in different combat situations. For example, most Covenant weapons eschew disposable ammo clips for a contained battery, which cannot be replaced if depleted. However, these weapons can overheat if fired continuously for prolonged periods. Human weapons are less effective at penetrating shields and require reloading, but cannot overheat due to prolonged fire. The player can carry a total of eight grenades (four human grenades, four Covenant) to dislodge and disrupt enemies. New in Halo 2 {{is the ability to}} board enemy vehicles that are near the player and traveling at low speeds. The player or AI latches onto the vehicle and forcibly ejects the other driver from the vehicle.|$|E

25|$|The main {{difference}} between a hadith and a historical report (khabar) is that a hadith is not concerned with an event as such, and normally does not specify <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>or</b> place. Rather the purpose of hadith is to record a religious doctrine as an authoritative source of Islamic law. By contrast, while a khabar may carry some legal or theological implications, its main aim is to convey information about a certain event.|$|E
25|$|In {{some areas}} such as Cape Peninsula, the sparrowhawks face habitat {{competition}} with Egyptian geese (Alopochen aegyptiaca), an aggressive species known to steal the nests of the sparrowhawks. This results in a costly loss for the sparrowhawks after the time and energy spent building the nest and may also lead {{to the death of}} current offspring. However, sparrowhawks occasionally have more than 1 nest at <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> <b>or</b> they can readily build a new nest, so, in the event that one is usurped by an Egyptian goose, the pair will sometimes start breeding again in a nearby alternative nest; or they might wait until the geese have left the nest with their goslings, or they abandon breeding for that year.|$|E

Other Spanish explorers arrived later in the 16th century and Florida came under Spanish rule. The Tequesta were resettled by the then-Spanish government in the Florida Keys, and the South Florida mainland was depopulated. Ponce de León referred to the bay as [...] "Chequescha" [...] after its inhabitants, becoming [...] "Tequesta" [...] {{by the time of}} Spanish governor Pedro Menéndez de Avilés later in the century. The present name has been attributed to a shipwrecked Basque sailor known as the [...] "Biscaino" [...] or [...] "Viscayno" [...] who lived in the area for <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> <b>or</b> to a more general allusion to the Bay of Biscay.|$|E

[...] Breimeier described the lyrics as walking [...] "a {{fine line between}} open expressions of faith and CCM clichés" [...] and granted that while [...] "Find You Waiting" [...] "relies heavily on platitudes, it's still powerfully affecting and relatable testimony". [...] Argyrakis, though, remarked that the band [...] "has plenty to say" [...] and their [...] "stacked sounds are never {{at the expense of}} a meaningful gospel message".|$|E

In addition to the original game, the Master Quest is included, as well as a new [...] "Boss Challenge" [...] mode that allows players to fight all of the bosses one at <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> <b>or</b> in sequential order. However, this version of Master Quest differs {{in the fact that the}} entire map is mirrored, similar to what Nintendo did for the Wii port of [...] Instructional videos are built into the 3DS version to guide the players who are lost or stuck in certain puzzles.

In this mode, {{up to four}} additional players with their own Nintendo DS wirelessly connected to the Wii (the [...] "Roadies") can assist the other players using instrument controllers. The Roadies can create setlists from the DS, or engage in gameplay through [...] "spells" [...] that improve {{the performance of the}} player they are assigned to. [...] Alternatively, in Roadie Battle mode, the Roadies can attempt to distract another player {{while at the same time}} removing the distractions placed on their player by another Roadie. [...] Warriors of Rock includes an improved version of a song creation tool, allowing players to share their songs using the online [...] "GHTunes" [...] services. Improvements include the ability to lay down note tracks directly while playing one of the instrument controllers and a larger number of guitar, bass, and drum samples to use. The player can use the built-on GH Studio to create their own music, save for vocals, to share with others on the GH Tracks service, either by laying down tracks one note at <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> <b>or</b> by jamming along to a pre-defined beat. Players can create their own customized rocker to use in Quickplay+ or online modes through the character creator, or use either the regular form or the Warrior version of the eight on-disc characters.|$|E

After he finished developing the technique for injecting genes into the future Mew Mews, he first tested it on himself to ensure that the subjects would not be harmed.

Ryô also built Mew Ichigo's and Mew Berry's respective robot assistants, R2000 and R3000. Ryô tends to talk to the girls in an abrupt manner, but displays a strong sense of personal responsibility, particularly with regards to the Mew Mews. He helps Ichigo several times, in his cat form, [...] "Alto", including by kissing her to help her change back human. Although Ryô's age is never given in the series, the official Tōkyō Myū Myū– Tōjō Shin Myū Myū!– Minna Issho ni Gohōshi Suru Nyan game guide lists him as being fifteen years old. In Mew Mew Power promotional material he is listed as being sixteen.|$|E
