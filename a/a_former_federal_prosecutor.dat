2500|$|Since {{the early}} 19th century, American courts have tried over 400 murders {{in which the}} victim's body had not been found; Bonie's case {{would have been the}} first in the Bronx. [...] "It's like running a 100-meter race when the {{criminal}} gets to start at the 20-meter mark," [...] <b>a</b> <b>former</b> <b>federal</b> <b>prosecutor</b> told the Times. “When you don't have a body, you don't have the best evidence in the crime." [...] But, prosecutors in Manhattan had gained convictions for con artists Sante and James Kimes in the 1998 murder of their landlady, Irene Silverman, without her body having been found. The prosecutor allowed conviction of Bonie was possible if other aspects of the case were strong.|$|E
2500|$|The {{trial and}} the verdict sparked {{nationwide}} debate on the validity and efficacy of the New Jersey hate crime statute and similar laws. Marcellus A. McRae, <b>a</b> <b>former</b> <b>federal</b> <b>prosecutor</b> uninvolved in the case, hailed the guilty verdicts as [...] "a watershed moment, because it says youth is not immunity". Steven Goldstein, the chairman of a New Jersey equal rights advocacy group, said that [...] "This verdict sends the important message that a 'kids will be kids' defense is no excuse to bully another student." [...] Louis Raveson, a professor of criminal and civil trial litigation at Rutgers School of Law-Newark, said that bias intimidation criteria had been met: [...] "I think the statute correctly predicted this kind of crime and ... is being used appropriately." ...|$|E
2500|$|The city rebounded in the mid- {{and late}} 1990s {{due to the}} steady {{expansion}} of the national economy and the Wall Street stock market boom that took place concomitantly, {{as well as the}} precipitous drop in crime, although stubbornly high unemployment remained a local problem. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, <b>a</b> <b>former</b> <b>federal</b> <b>prosecutor,</b> is credited by many for revitalizing Times Square and making the city more [...] "liveable" [...] by cracking down on crime. Changes in the worldwide economy during this time proved to be especially favorable to New York because of its highly developed transportation and communications infrastructure, as well as its massive population base. Over the course of the decade, the city's image transformed from being one of a bygone, decaying metropolis to one of the world's preeminent [...] "global cities." ...|$|E

2500|$|On June 6, 2014, the ESPN program Outside the Lines aired an {{interview}} with Rashad McCants, a starter on the NCAA championship-winning 2004–05 team, in which {{he claimed to have}} taken phony classes and had tutors write his classwork to stay academically eligible. Coach Roy Williams, separately interviewed by ESPN, as well as McCants's teammates, disputed McCants's claims. [...] Four months later, Kenneth L. Wainstein, <b>a</b> <b>former</b> <b>federal</b> <b>prosecutor</b> hired by the university to investigate academic fraud reported by the media, issued a 131-page report showing at least 3,100 students took [...] "paper" [...] classes with artificially high grades over an 18-year period, and athletes were funneled to these classes by academic advisers. Wainstein reported that varsity athletes made up 1,871, or roughly half, of the enrollment, with the men's basketball team accounting for 12.1 percent (226) the athletes. Although two former UNC football coaches admitted knowing that a lot of students took the classes, there is no evidence the coaches knew the classes were irregular, and Williams denied knowledge (Dean Smith and Bill Guthridge, Williams' predecessors, were not interviewed because of poor health).|$|E

According to an Associated Press story, the OIG identified more than $34 million in losses in Global Fund grants in various countries in Africa. The OIG could not provide an overall accounting of how much was lost at the Global Fund because it [...] "examined {{only a tiny fraction of}} the $10 billion that the fund has spent since its creation in 2002." ...|$|R

5000|$|Former FBI {{director}} Louis Freeh and his firm, including <b>a</b> team of <b>former</b> <b>federal</b> <b>prosecutors</b> and FBI agents, {{were hired}} by the Penn State Board of Trustees to conduct an independent investigation into the scandal. In the opinion of writer Michael Sokolove, the mission Freeh was given seemed to presuppose that Sandusky's crimes were not his alone and that people who had reason to suspect him had looked away. After interviewing over 400 people and reviewing over 3.5 million documents, the independent investigation team reported that Paterno, Spanier, Curley and Schultz had concealed Sandusky's actions {{in order to protect}} publicity surrounding Penn State's celebrated football program. Freeh's firm's investigation found that by their actions, the four men [...] "failed to protect against a child sexual predator harming children for over a decade."
