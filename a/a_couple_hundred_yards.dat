60|$|An {{opportunity}} {{was soon}} offered him. Some one gave an order, and after some pushing and jostling he squeezed himself between {{the legs of}} a table {{on the top of}} the barricade. A ragged desperado, who scowled furiously and used what seemed to be violently abusive language, had contested the position with him, and it struck Cliffe as remarkable that he should have taken so much trouble to secure a post where he might get shot. He was there, however, and thought he could make pretty good shooting up to <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards.</b>|$|E

50|$|The group devises a plan {{to escape}} using Ben's truck, which is out of fuel, by {{refueling}} at a locked gas pump <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> away. A search of the corpse {{who lived in the}} farmhouse produces an unknown set of keys. Judy Rose, Tom, and Ben proceed up the hill toward the gas pump, but their plan begins to unravel when Ben falls from the bed of the truck and is left to defend himself. To their horror, the key to the gas pump is not among the bunch they brought with them. When Tom shoots the lock off, the leaking gasoline is ignited by a burning piece of wood in the truck. The resulting explosion kills both Tom and Judy.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the time}} Dodge reached his men, the {{fire at the}} bottom of the gulch had already jumped from the south ridge to the bottom of the north slope. The intense heat {{combined}} with wind coming off the river and pushed the flames up-gulch into the dry grass of the north slope causing what fire fighters call a [...] "blow up". Various side ridges running down the north slope obscuring the crew's view, so they could not see the conditions further down the gulch, and they initially continued down toward the fire. When Dodge finally got a glimpse of what was happening below, he turned the men around and started them angling back up the gulch. Within <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards,</b> he ordered the men to drop packs and heavy tools (Pulaskis, shovels and crosscut saws): ...|$|E
