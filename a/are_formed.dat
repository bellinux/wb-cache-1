5|$|A uniform tiling is a tiling {{in which}} each tile is a regular polygon and in which every vertex can be mapped to every other vertex by a {{symmetry}} of the tiling. Usually, uniform tilings additionally are required to have tiles that meet edge-to-edge, but if this requirement is relaxed then there are eight additional uniform tilings. Four <b>are</b> <b>formed</b> from infinite strips of squares or equilateral triangles, and three <b>are</b> <b>formed</b> from equilateral triangles and regular hexagons. The remaining one is the Pythagorean tiling.|$|E

5|$|While {{all four}} boroughs <b>were</b> <b>formed</b> after Sullivan County was established, {{seven of the}} nine townships <b>were</b> <b>formed</b> while still part of Lycoming County. The first of these was Shrewsbury Township, which {{encompassed}} all of modern Sullivan County when it <b>was</b> <b>formed</b> in 1803. Elkland Township <b>was</b> <b>formed</b> from Shrewsbury in 1804, as were Cherry (1824), Davidson (1833), and Forks Townships (1833).

5|$|Upper-level {{municipal}} {{divisions in}} the republic <b>are</b> <b>formed</b> {{within the boundaries of}} existing administrative divisions, although this is not a requirement of federal law. Municipal districts <b>are</b> <b>formed</b> within the boundaries of the administrative districts, and municipal urban okrugs cover the territories of the cities/towns of the republican significance. Municipal urban settlements cover the territories of the urban-type settlements with adjacent rural localities, while municipal rural settlements cover the territories of groups of rural localities and largely correspond to the territories of former selsoviets.|$|E
5|$|A {{compound}} that has two immiscible hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts {{within the same}} molecule is called an amphiphilic molecule. Many amphiphilic molecules show lyotropic liquid-crystalline phase sequences depending on the volume balances between the hydrophilic part and hydrophobic part. These structures <b>are</b> <b>formed</b> through the micro-phase segregation of two incompatible components on a nanometer scale. Soap is an everyday example of a lyotropic liquid crystal.|$|E
5|$|According {{to local}} geologists, the exact {{source of the}} spring remains unknown, but it is {{believed}} that its origin may be southwest of its actual location, possibly at Bukit Timah. Hot springs <b>are</b> <b>formed</b> when underground water comes into contact with hot rock masses. The resulting high pressure causes the water to seep upwards through cracks, forcing itself out of the ground as a spring.|$|E

5|$|Halides of the {{structure}} PoX2, PoX4 and PoF6 are known. They are soluble in the corresponding hydrogen halides, i.e., PoClX in HCl, PoBrX in HBr and PoI4 in HI. Polonium dihalides <b>are</b> <b>formed</b> by direct reaction of the elements or by reduction of PoCl4 with SO2 and with PoBr4 with H2S at room temperature.

5|$|Heavy metals {{condense}} in planets as {{a result}} of stellar evolution and destruction processes. Stars lose much of their mass when it is ejected late in their lifetimes, and sometimes thereafter {{as a result}} of a neutron star merger, thereby increasing the abundance of elements heavier than helium in the interstellar medium. When gravitational attraction causes this matter to coalesce and collapse new stars and planets <b>are</b> <b>formed.</b>|$|E
