5|$|North High School {{is home to}} KBEM-FM, a {{radio station}} owned by the Minneapolis Public Schools. The station signed {{on the air in}} October, 1970, and moved to North in 1983 when the Minneapolis Area Vocational Technical Institute, where the station had been located from its launch (as Vocational High School), closed and the {{building}} sold. Students are responsible for much of the station's operation, and 35 hours of airtime <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>is</b> devoted to student programming. Approximately 150 students are involved in the radio station's operation, with the majority attending North. Students typically enroll in the program as ninth-graders and are prepared for on-air duties by their junior or senior year.|$|E

25|$|There is {{evidence}} that prediabetes is a curable disease state. Intensive weight loss and lifestyle intervention, if sustained, may improve glucose tolerance substantially and prevent progression from IGT to type 2 diabetes. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) study found a 16% reduction in diabetes risk for every kilogram of weight loss. Reducing weight by 7% through a low-fat diet and performing 150 minutes of exercise <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>is</b> the goal. In observational studies, individuals following vegetarian diets are about half as likely to develop diabetes, compared with non-vegetarians. The ADA guidelines recommend modest weight loss (5-10% body weight), moderate-intensity exercise (30 minutes daily), and smoking cessation.|$|E

25|$|Flucytosine by {{mouth is}} used for the {{treatment}} of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of Candida or Cryptococcus neoformans. It can also be used for the treatment of chromomycosis (chromoblastomycosis), if susceptible strains cause the infection. Flucytosine must not be used as a sole agent in life-threatening fungal infections due to relatively weak antifungal effects and fast development of resistance, but rather in combination with amphotericin B and/or azole antifungals such as fluconazole or itraconazole. Minor infections such as candidal cystitis may be treated with flucytosine alone. In some countries, treatment with slow intravenous infusions for no more than <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>is</b> also a therapeutic option, particular if the disease is life-threatening.|$|E

2500|$|When not operationally deployed, the HRT conducts {{full-time}} {{training for}} its members at various sites across the country. Two {{to three hours}} each day are set aside for physical training, a defensive tactics session, and combative training. One day <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>is</b> devoted to maintaining either perishable skills (such as fast roping, breaching, and photography) or specialized skills (such as mobile assaults, manhunt and rural operations), maritime operations, helicopter operations, parachuting, {{weapons of mass destruction}} training (provided by the United States Department of Energy), and cold weather operations. [...] Three days are spent honing sniping or close quarters combat skills on the various training ranges available to the team. Biweekly, one day is allotted for gear maintenance. Discretionary time to be used by team leaders is built into the schedule. During a routine week of training, {{it is not unusual for}} HRT operators to fire 1,000 rounds of ammunition to keep their shooting skills honed. Every 12 to 18 months, the HRT also participates in at least one major combined exercise that may involve a variety of governmental entities, such as the FBI and the departments of Defense, State, Energy, and Homeland Security.|$|E
2500|$|Author Ben Arment {{describes}} Armstrong as [...] "turning {{the company}} into a local news service", evolving AOL into a [...] "journalism business that reports local news and filters {{the best of}} the Web". One of the strengths of Armstrong's strategy and focus on digital journalism is catering for local communities, particularly those who are devoid of their own newspapers. Consolidating the move into journalism came in June 2011 with the acquisition of The Huffington Post. The Huffington Post Media Group was established to integrate the newspaper and AOL's News, Tech, Women, Local, Multicultural, Entertainment, Video, and Community portals in a merger which was estimated at the time [...] to reach 117 million Americans and 270 million people worldwide. Armstrong appointed Arianna Huffington, the co-founder and editor-in-chief of the paper as president. He stated of the merger: [...] "The acquisition of The Huffington Post will create a next-generation American media company with global reach that combines content, community, and social experiences for consumers. Together, our companies will embrace the digital future and become a digital destination that delivers unmatched experiences for both consumers and advertisers." [...] A [...] strong advocate of women's issues, Armstrong launched a number of sites under the AOL banner which specifically cater to women, including StyleList.com, AOL Shopping, and KitchenDaily.com, and 60% of the readers at Patch Media are female. In his business meetings and discussions, Armstrong, who can work up to 80 hours <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> <b>is</b> known to be a keen listener, and promotes an atmosphere in which executives can be outspoken and constructive with their input.|$|E
