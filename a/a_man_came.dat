[...] "I thought, well, why would you expect that you automatically could do it? Just because I was a small girl, was I {{not to be able}} to do it? It was a memorable experience because it occurred to me then that other people had a different view of what I should or shouldn't be capable of doing. I think that people should just do whatever they can do or want to do. It shouldn't be a matter of if they're a man or a woman. It shouldn't be a matter of one's sex." ...|$|E

Pru adapted {{one of the}} song's lyrics, [...] "If <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>came</b> my way and I didn't doubt him", {{from one of her}} poems. While discussing the meaning of the title, the singer said it derived from an [...] "old southern saying: 'I could smell you coming'". [...] "Hazy Shade" [...] is a ballad that Hogan described as [...] "recall 'blue light in the basement' old skool slow jams". Preceded by [...] "Salsa Interlude", Pru's cover of Sade's 1984 single [...] "Smooth Operator" [...] features a stronger Latin-inspired instrumental than the original. Hogan noted that the song included [...] "popping percussion and fluttery flute runs". The ending of the ninth track, [...] "Can't Compare Your Love", takes inspiration from spoken word performances, and the following song ,"Sketches of Pain", deliberately plays with the title of Miles Davis' 1960 album Sketches of Spain. Colin Ross of PopMatters described the twelfth track, [...] "What They Gone Do?", as featuring a [...] "brassy two-step" [...] in its instrumentation.|$|E

2500|$|In 1861, the Russian {{sector of}} Poland, {{partitioned}} since the previous century, was disturbed and under martial law. Alexander II needed a skillful governor for Poland {{and decided to}} appoint Constantin for the job. In early 1862, Konstantin arrived in Warsaw as the new Namiestnik of the Kingdom of Poland. On 4 July 1862, his second day as Governor-General, a tailor's apprentice and Polish nationalist named Jaroszyński saw him leaving a Warsaw theater, and shot him; the bullet grazed the Grand Duke in the shoulder, but left him otherwise unhurt. Konstantin described the attack as follows: [...] "I went into the square and <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>came</b> from the crowd approaching me. From the breast he pulled a pistol, and fired. I {{ran back to the}} theater, otherwise I would have been dead." ...|$|E

He started driving, and ran out of gas and money in Jersey City, New Jersey at Audubon Park. <b>A</b> <b>man</b> <b>came</b> over and started talking to us, a Mr. Cohn. He said to my father 'You look like you need a job,' and my father said 'I do'." [...] Adams' father was given a job as janitor of an apartment building along with living quarters in the basement. Eventually, they moved to Van Nostrand Avenue between Ocean Avenue and Rutgers Avenue. His mother worked for Western Electric in Kearny, New Jersey.|$|E

Gunshots were heard, and the rest {{continued}} towards Herrin. A farmer later discovered McDowell's body. He had been shot four times – twice in the stomach, and once each in the chest and head. [...] A car drove up to the procession, and <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>came</b> out whom some said they overheard being called [...] "Hugh Willis" [...] and [...] "the president."

2500|$|Cosby was in Los Angeles in January 1997, {{while on}} winter break from his classes at Columbia University. In {{the early hours}} of January 16, 1997, he was visiting friends in Los Angeles and driving north on Interstate 405 through the Sepulveda Pass when, at {{approximately}} 1a.m., he pulled off the freeway onto Skirball Center Drive to fix a flat tire. He called a friend, Stephanie Crane, who drove to meet him; she parked behind him to light the area with her headlights while Cosby changed the tire. She later testified that <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>came</b> to her window and told her, [...] "Open the door or I'll kill you." [...] Frightened, Crane drove away but after approximately [...] turned her car around and came back. She saw a man running away and found Cosby lying on the ground {{in a pool of blood}} next to the driver's side of his dark green Mercedes-Benz. He had been shot in the head. It appeared robbery was a motive, but Cosby was still wearing a Rolex watch and had three $20 bills in his pocket.|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, Hungerford {{made the}} right choice in {{breaking}} professional ties with George W. Patterson Jr., who took over as the President of the Geo. Washington Bank. On November 2, 1868, Patterson left work, placing his eighteen-year-old teller, George Eaton, in charge of the bank. Some time after three o'clock, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>came</b> in and announced that he was a government detective there to arrest Eaton and Patterson for counterfeiting money. Eaton managed to lock the vault before being handcuffed. The so-called detective placed a revolver to Eaton's head and said to him: [...] "Young man, you may as well know my business at once. I want the money of this bank or I will blow your brains out." [...] Eaton told him to go ahead and a struggle ensued. The two compromised and Eaton, who was still in handcuffs, allowed the man to escape in exchange for his life. Eaton ran around Corning until he eventually found Patterson. By then, of course, the would-be robber escaped. Patterson offered a $100 reward for the assailant's arrest. Patterson was fortunate that he did not find his bank vault empty upon his return.|$|E

During the early 1970s, Parks dealt with prescription drug abuse. He would later say of himself as being [...] "dead for five years", and spent {{the first half of}} the decade [...] "trying to regain an interest in living." [...] Parks later stated, [...] "When I was head of audio-visual services and on the A staff at Warner Bros., <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>came</b> into my office and he had a snake and his name was Alice. Right then, I knew that my days were numbered as a person really interested in the record business." [...] Speaking about his department during this time, Parks stated, [...] "I provided that each artist would get 25% of the net profits of the rentals or sales. It was going to be a very promising market for the artist. Warners soon tired of what I thought was a fair equation of participation in creative profits, and basically isolated me." ...|$|E

[...] One person {{impersonated}} who's reacted positively to her portrayal as a kleptomaniac Dame who wreaks havoc on an unsuspecting public is actress Judi Dench. Dench's daughter, Finty Williams, posted a clip of Ullman playing her mother on Facebook with the caption, [...] "brilliant, just brilliant." [...] Critics also praised the impersonation, with one writer saying: [...] "Her impersonation of Dench is so spot on that, {{for a second or}} two, you can't be sure she is not the real deal. Her performance easily transcends the make-up thanks to her mastery of posture, gesture and facial control as well as pitch- perfect vocals." [...] While filming on location, on-lookers asked if they were filming a James Bond film after catching Ullman in character. At the 36th London Critics' Circle Film Awards, Judi Dench introduced herself as [...] "Tracey Ullman." [...] In April 2017, while speaking to BBC Radio 4's Front Row, Dench commented on Ullman's portrayal, saying that she doted on it, and dubbed Ullman as brilliant.

2500|$|... in 1999, Bright {{received}} a tip about a bluegrass act who was performing {{at a bar}} called [...] "The Fiddle and Steel Guitar Bar" [...] in Nashville's Printer's Alley. The group consisted of Gary Vernon (stage name [...] "Gary LeVox"), Joe Don Rooney and Jay DeMarcus. After hearing them perform, Bright was impressed by their vocal blend and invited {{them to come to}} his office where they sang for him a cappella. [...] Bright signed them to a recording, publishing, and management contract, and promptly took them into the studio to record three songs. At that time the band did not have a name; so, during a performance they asked their bar patrons to suggest one. <b>A</b> <b>man</b> <b>came</b> up at their intermission and suggested [...] "Rascal Flatts", saying that he once had a band by that name in high school. They liked the name, and bought the rights to it on the spot for five thousand dollars using funds from their signing bonus. The agreement was written on a napkin. Bright auditioned the group for executives of Disney's Lyric Street Records who agreed on a recording contract, but Bright retained total creative control. It was a risky proposition at first, because all of the band's salaries, expenses, equipment, and pre-existing tour obligations had to be paid by Bright and his new company. [...] Bright's employees took the band members to the gym regularly to get them in better physical shape. Bright worked incredible hours and told his wife, [...] "If this flops, we'll have to sell the house". [...] The band, Rascal Flatts, became an enormous success, their first seven albums were all certified platinum or higher in record sales by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). As of 2009, [...] they had sold 18.6 million albums. When the band learned that the Fiddle and Steel Guitar Bar would be closing to make room for a new hotel, they returned to the honky tonk for a final concert in November of 2014. Band member Gary LeVox said, [...] "This stage got us on stages around the world. We're forever indebted." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Hiyya {{said that}} Abram's father Terah {{manufactured}} idols (as [...] implies), and once Terah went away and left Abram {{to mind the}} store. <b>A</b> <b>man</b> <b>came</b> and asked to buy an idol. Abram asked the man how old he was. The man replied that he was 50 years old. Abram exclaimed {{that it was a}} shame that a man of 50 would worship a day-old object. The man became embarrassed and left. On another occasion, a woman came with a plate of flour and asked Abram to offer it to the idols. Abram took a stick, broke the idols, and put the stick in the largest idol's hand. When Terah returned, he demanded that Abram explain what he had done. Abram told Terah that the idols fought among themselves to be fed first, and the largest broke the others with the stick. Terah asked Abram why he made sport of him, for the idols had no consciousness. Abram replied by asking Terah to listen to what he had just said. Thereupon Terah seized Abram and delivered him to Nimrod, king of Shinar. Nimrod proposed that they worship the fire. Abram replied that they should rather worship water, which extinguishes fire. Nimrod agreed to worship water. Abram replied that they should rather worship clouds, which bear the water. Nimrod agreed to worship the clouds. Abram replied that they should rather worship the winds, which disperse the clouds. Nimrod agreed to worship the wind. Abram replied that they should rather worship human beings, who withstand the wind. Nimrod then accused Abram of just bandying words, and decreed that they would worship nothing but the fire. Nimrod cast Abram into the fire, challenging Abram's God to save him from it. Haran was standing there undecided. Haran thought to himself that if Abram survived, then Haran would say that he was of Abram's faith, but if Nimrod was victorious, then Haran would say that he was on Nimrod's side. When Abram descended into the fiery furnace, God saved him. Nimrod then asked Haran whose belief he shared. Haran replied that he shared Abram's faith. Thereupon Nimrod cast Haran into the fire, and he died in his father's presence, as [...] reports, [...] "And Haran died in the presence of ( [...] , al pene) his father Terah." ...|$|E
