5|$|Starting in 1940, British {{aircraft}} {{were increasingly}} {{equipped with the}} IFF Mk. II system, which allowed radar operators to determine whether <b>a</b> <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> their screen was a friendly aircraft. IFF was a responder that sent out a pulse of radio signal immediately on reception of a radio signal from a radar system. The IFF's transmission mixed with the radar's own pulse, causing the blip to stretch out in time from a small peak to an extended rectangular shape.|$|E
25|$|According to Pelin, {{he walked}} to the upper sector console holding JP550's flight {{progress}} strip. He asked Tasić if the DC-9 could climb to FL350. Tasić took the strip from Pelin and looked at it, then asked where the aircraft was at the moment. Pelin then pointed to <b>a</b> <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> the screen approaching Kostajnica. Tasić's response was 'yes, it could climb'. Pelin then noticed an aircraft on the screen coming from the direction of Metlika and asked Tasić about it, who said 'wait until they cross'. Pelin referred to the middle-sector screen {{to make sure that he}} had identified the DC-9 positively on the upper-sector screen. He then returned to Tasić and they both watched the targets pass each other, at which point Tasić authorised JP550 to climb. Pelin then called out to Erjavec and said 'yes, climb it'. Upon Erjavec receiving the OK from Pelin, he instructed the DC-9 to climb to FL350. That was at 10:07:40.|$|E
25|$|Anthony {{commuted}} to Towson Catholic High School for {{his first}} three years of high school. During the summer of 1999, Anthony grew five inches into the frame of a 6–5 swingman. He suddenly became one of the area's top players and {{made a name for himself}} in the area, being named The Baltimore Suns metro player of the year in 2001, as well as Baltimore Catholic League player of the year. During his sophomore year, he averaged 14 points, 5 rebounds, 4 assists and 2 steals. Towson Catholic surged to a record of 26–3 and finished third in the state tournament. Anthony enjoyed a successful high school basketball career as a junior, almost doubling his numbers in scoring and rebounds, averaging 23 points and 10.3 rebounds. Despite his successful year, Anthony was distracted by all of the attention, and was suspended on several occasions for skipping classes. He barely registered <b>a</b> <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> the radars of pro scouts with his skinny frame and lack of strength; many scouts felt that he was not ready for the physical demands of the NBA. In the end, Towson Catholic fell short of the state title, although he was named Baltimore's County Player of the Year, All-Metropolitan Player of the Year and Baltimore Catholic League Player of the Year.|$|E

50|$|Moreover, Cold-War {{radar systems}} {{were far from}} perfect. The system created <b>a</b> visible <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> the operator’s display {{if and only if}} it {{received}} enough returns with enough energy to rise above the background noise of the system. Atmospheric conditions, electronic interference from internal components, and other factors sometimes created false returns known as “clutter,” concealed real returns, or made blips difficult for the operator to interpret correctly.|$|R
5|$|By the summer, 1940, the Chain Home radar {{stations}} {{along the}} English and Scottish coasts {{was able to}} track incoming aircraft from continental Europe at all but the lowest altitudes. The best detection altitude was 20,000 feet. Aircraft at this height could be detected over 100 miles away. To assess their identity, IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) could, by means of <b>a</b> distinctive <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> radar screens, distinguish German and British aircraft.|$|R
500|$|In the 1930s, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was {{the most}} {{respected}} movie production studio in Hollywood. When Tracy arrived there, his own reputation was not strong. Biographer James Curtis writes: [...] "Tracy was scarcely <b>a</b> <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> the box office barometer in 1935, a critics' darling and little more". He was, however, well known for being a troublemaker. Producer Irving G. Thalberg was nevertheless enthusiastic about working with the actor, telling journalist Louella Parsons: [...] "Spencer Tracy will become one of MGM's most valuable stars." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{movie was}} not a box office success, though the very small budget meant its losses were also minimal; it was widely seen as <b>a</b> <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> the radar during John Travolta's massive {{comeback}} as a movie star during the post-Pulp Fiction phase of his career.|$|E
5000|$|... "This type of {{research}} is routine.... From an academic point of view, it doesn't seem peculiar to me.

[...] —Theodore Clevenger, dean of FSU's Department of Communication talking about [...] "Madonna Studies".|$|E
25|$|As {{the system}} was being developed, a further {{improvement}} was introduced that allowed for continuous following as opposed to periodic re-setting. The switching system was modified such that the range {{was sent to the}} upper line for 2.5milliseconds (ms), and the range and radiogoniometer signals for 7.5ms. If the signal was properly nulled, the two upper signals would mix and produce <b>a</b> single bright <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> the upper trace, while the lower trace would be nulled, as before. If the signal was not nulled, <b>a</b> faint second <b>blip</b> would appear to smear out the upper trace, noticeable even before the <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> the lower trace became visible.|$|R
5|$|Each pair of antennas was {{connected}} to a motorized switch that rapidly switched between the pairs, a technique known as lobe switching. Both signals were then sent to a cathode ray tube (CRT) for display, {{with one of them}} passing through a voltage inverter. If the target was to the left, the display would show <b>a</b> longer <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> the left than the right. When the target was dead ahead, the blips would be equal length. There was an inherently limited accuracy to such a solution, about five degrees but it was a practical solution in terms of limiting the antenna sizes.|$|R
5000|$|Determining the {{location}} in space of <b>a</b> given <b>blip</b> was <b>a</b> complex multi-step process. First the operator would select a set of receiver antennas using the motorized switch, feeding signals to the receiver system. The antennas were connected together in pairs, forming two directional antennas, sensitive primarily along the X or Y axis, Y being the line of shoot. The operator would then [...] "swing the gonio", or [...] "hunt", back and forth until the selected blip reached its minimum deflection on this display (or maximum, at 90 degrees off). The operator would measure the distance against the scale, and then tell the plotter the range and bearing of the selected target. The operator would then select <b>a</b> different <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> the display and repeat the process. For targets at different altitudes, the operator might have to try different antennas to maximize the signal.|$|R

The club managed {{to turn things}} around in following seasons, and by 2005-06 achieved a double, they were crowned champions of Serie D and also won the Coppa Italia Serie D.|$|E
5000|$|In October of the {{following}} year, Zahra {{was elected to the}} Helsinki City Council with nearly 2,500 votes, [...] "a large number of which were given in areas where immigrants hardly show up as <b>a</b> <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> the local population register."

5|$|For BABS, {{the only}} change was {{to change the}} broadcast's {{transmissions}} {{to a series of}} short pulses rather than a continuous signal. These pulses were sent out when triggered by the AI radar's signals and were powerful enough that they could be picked up by the Mk. IV receiver within a few miles. On reception, the Mk. IV would receive either the dots or dashes, and the operator would see an alternating series of blips centred in the display, popping out and then disappearing as the BABS antennas switched. The duration of the blip indicated whether the aircraft was to the left or right, and became <b>a</b> continuous <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> the centreline. This technique was known as AI beam approach (AIBA).|$|R
5000|$|Upon its release, {{the song}} {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Jordan Sargent of Spin described the remix as [...] "a delightfully sunny song that nudges up against soca. D'Banj is a Nigerian pop star {{who is the}} breakout star of Africa's afrobeats scene, which bridges {{the gap between the}} sounds and rhythms of Afrobeat to the tempo of dance music." [...] Carl Williott of Idolator added: [...] "It’s a summery island beat, not at all the brooding, challenging stuff we’d been expecting Yeezy to break his silence with (based on his recent angsty behavior). It’s certainly catchy, and as far as recent Kanye material goes, it’s refreshingly carefree and simple. But it doesn’t amount to anything more than <b>a</b> momentary <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> the radar." ...|$|R
5000|$|Basic radars {{present the}} target {{information}} on a display and displayed targets {{are referred to as}} <b>blips.</b> Based <b>on</b> the relative size of the <b>blips</b> <b>on</b> the display, <b>a</b> radar operator could determine large targets from small targets. When <b>a</b> <b>blip</b> enhancing technique is used, small targets returns are augmented to look like large targets.|$|R

50|$|With {{very slight}} modification, the same display {{could be used}} to time the {{difference}} between two arbitrary signals. For navigational use, any number of identifying characteristics {{could be used to}} differentiate the master from the secondary signals. In this case, the portable receiver triggered its trace when it received the master signal. As the signals from secondary arrived they would cause <b>a</b> <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> the display in the same fashion as a target on the radar, and the exact delay between the master and secondary easily determined.|$|E

Whatever Mike lacks in brains, he more than makes up for in heart. But in the eyes of his beautiful classmate he may as well not exist. Desperate to capture the attention of his comely but somewhat shallow dream girl Mike enlists the help of universally disliked teacher Ms Goldwyn to increase his IQ so that he may finally form <b>a</b> <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> Hannah's romantic radar.|$|E
50|$|The miniseries {{begins in}} 1987. At {{the height of}} the Cold War, two US airmen monitor their radar screens at a quiet and remote NORAD {{facility}} in Alaska. Suddenly, one of the bored operators notices <b>an</b> unexpected <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> his radar screen. It appears to be an unidentified aircraft sneaking in on the leading edge of a weather front. He alerts his partner about the threat and begins to contact Elmendorf AFB. The other airman retrieves a silenced pistol from his desk and kills him. He then proceeds to shoot the remaining station personnel while they are sleeping in their bunks. Lighting a cigarette, the traitor notifies Elmendorf that the station will be out of commission for the next hour in order to repair a malfunctioning generator. The necessary blind spot has been created.|$|R
30|$|The third measure can {{be defined}} by the {{calculation}} of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). ROC concept came from the signal detection theory developed in World War II to analyze the radar performance <b>on</b> detecting <b>a</b> correct <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> the radar screen (Hanley and McNeil 1982). ROC is drawn by plotting the true alarm rate against the false alarm rate at various settings. Since the area under the ROC curve, also known as AUC, provides a single and unit-less measure, the discrimination performance which {{is the ability of}} the ex ante control chart to classify the true and false signals correctly can be measured. AUC can be computed either through the parametric (trapezoidal procedure) or nonparametric (maximum likelihood estimator) methods. Both methods are available in computer programs such as Minitab and Matlab.|$|R
5000|$|George J. Klose, {{a product}} {{development}} engineer at Mattel, {{came up with}} the concept of re-purposing standard calculator hardware to create a hand-held electronic game using individual display segments as blips that would [...] "move" [...] on the display. He designed the game play for Mattel Auto Race, inspired by auto racing games commonly found in video arcades in the 1970s. First, George made a proof of concept prototype demonstrating <b>a</b> <b>blip</b> moving <b>on</b> <b>an</b> LED display without using a microprocessor to get approval from Mattel for further development. He then looked for a manufacturer to provide a circuit board that would fit into a compact package. George and his manager Richard Cheng approached the Microelectronics Division of Rockwell International, at the time, a leader in designing handheld calculator chips, to supply Mattel with the hardware and provide technical support.|$|R

50|$|Grand-Slam - Being {{the most}} {{expensive}} unit next to the Land-Armor, the Grand-Slam missile is very powerful. It travels across the battleground very slowly, and if it successfully reaches the opposing base, it automatically destroys it with 100 percent damage. The Grand-Slam can't be seen or interacted with on the graphical area and can only be seen as <b>a</b> <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> the radar (the game will flash a warning when a Grand-Slam is launched). The only way to destroy a Grand-Slam is to send another Grand-Slam to collide with it on {{the opposite end of}} its path.|$|E
50|$|Indication : The {{response}} or {{evidence from}} an examination, such as <b>a</b> <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> {{the screen of}} an instrument. Indications are classified as true or false. False indications are those caused by factors {{not related to the}} principles of the testing method or by improper implementation of the method, like film damage in radiography, electrical interference in ultrasonic testing etc. True indications are further classified as relevant and non relevant. Relevant indications are those caused by flaws. Non relevant indications are those caused by known features of the tested object, like gaps, threads, case hardening etc.|$|E
5000|$|As well as enemy Radars, {{the game}} {{features}} a [...] "spotting" [...] mechanic to locate enemies, allowing players to {{press a button}} (Q by default) to highlight a specific enemy in sight and alert their teammates about the enemy's presence. When an enemy is spotted, the team who spotted the robot hears, [...] "spotted", <b>a</b> hexagon <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> the minimap follows the robot, and a username and avatar overlay appears above the player, even through obstacles. A player who has been spotted hears a siren and has a red exclamation mark appear on their screen that fades over time until {{they are no longer}} spotted. This feature is currently obsolete after the Window maker update, and radar accessories are down for good, there are full forge price refund for players with existing inventory. The Window Maker Module was made to fill in this gap.|$|R
25|$|A {{receiver}} {{listening for}} these signals and displaying them on an oscilloscope will see <b>a</b> series of <b>blips</b> <b>on</b> the display. By measuring {{the distance between}} them, the delay between the two signals can be calculated. For instance, a receiver might measure {{the distance between the}} two <b>blips</b> to represent <b>a</b> delay of 0.5ms. This implies that the difference in the distance to the two stations is 150km. In this case there are an infinite number of locations where that delay could be measured – 75km from one station and 225 from the other, or 150km from one and 300 from the other, and so on.|$|R
5000|$|The signals were {{combined}} {{at one of}} the radar stations (at the location of the Type 85 forming one end of the baseline) in a phase correlator that produced a series of possible locations and plotted them as <b>a</b> series of <b>blips</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> unique [...] "theta-phi" [...] display. The operators manually adjusted gains {{in order to reduce the}} number of blips, and then sent that information to a remote display where it could be combined with normal data from the Type 85. The idea was to locate any specialty-equipped jammer aircraft within a larger attack, allowing them to be prioritized for attack, thereby lowering the ECM load on other radars.|$|R

25|$|The spiral and helical scan systems {{produced}} {{very different}} displays {{from the same}} basic data. With the helical-scan system, the radar dish was moving horizontally, producing a series of stripes across the screen while scanning up and down so subsequent lines were above or below the last pass. This created a raster scan display, not unlike a television. Echoes caused the signal to brighten, producing <b>a</b> spot, or <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> the display. The blip's location indicated the direction to the target relative {{the nose of the}} fighter, represented by the centre point of the display. The further the blip was from the centre of the screen, the further away the target was from the centreline. The range was not directly indicated in this sort of display.|$|R
2500|$|In a November 19, 2015 radio {{interview}} with Hugh Hewitt, Palin {{was asked about}} the legalization of recreational marijuana in Alaska, to which Palin responded, [...] "We've got that libertarian streak in us, and I grew up in Alaska when pot was legal anyway. It was absolutely no big deal. I mean, you didn't smoke it because your parents would strangle you. And if you were a jock and you were, you know, a Christian going to youth group, you just didn't do it, right? And I still believe that. But when it comes to picking our battles, for many of us in Alaska, legalization of marijuana just was never really <b>a</b> bright <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> the radar screen, so it didn't surprise me when the voters of Alaska went back to legalizing it. For some years there, it had not been legalized. I look on the national scene and think, 'Wow, of all things to be fighting over and battling over.' Especially when it comes to medical marijuana, I think, 'Hmm. It's just not my baby.'" ...|$|R
50|$|Given {{the limited}} angle that the Mk. III scanned, 10 degrees at most, {{the system was}} {{normally}} paired with a second radar with a much wider scanning pattern. In {{the case of the}} AA No. 4, this provided a complete 360 degree scan that was displayed on a plan-position indicator. The operators of this second radar would call out contacts to the Mk. III operators, who would spin their antenna to the indicated bearing and then move the antenna vertically to find the target. When <b>a</b> <b>blip</b> was seen <b>on</b> the coarse range display, the range operator would move the strobe into position, and from then on all of the operators would move their controls continuously to create smooth tracking.|$|R
