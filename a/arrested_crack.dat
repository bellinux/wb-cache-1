In contrast, the compressive wave is reflected by the open crack on the left half of the fracture surface. The arrival of the compressive wave immediately arrests the propagating crack tip, and we observe an expanding circular quiescent zone that is concentric with the <b>arrested</b> <b>crack</b> tip, a signature feature of dynamic crack arrest.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{method of}} modal {{acoustic}} emission monitoring and waveform analysis is {{developed as a}} means for tracking two of the primary damage mechanisms in unidirectional composite lamina, matrix-cracking and fiber–matrix debonding. Unidirectional 30, 45 and 90 coupons of a rubber-toughened carbon-epoxy are monitored in this way for various loading histories. A method of comparing waveforms from different samples is proposed in order to establish the similarity of microcracking regardless of fiber direction. Histograms of waveform energy are used as a measure of average <b>arrested</b> <b>crack</b> length versus stress level. Larger faster cracks will emit more energy. Finally, an interpretation of the AE data is given based on an initial population of existing flaws where a cumulative distribution function (CDF) of microcracking is defined and used to study effects of stress history.

Steel fibres in concrete are considered to be insulated owing to the high impedance of the passive layer. However, they will become conductive if they are depassivated. Although low carbon steel fibres may suffer severe corrosion when located near the concrete surface or bridging the cracks, embedded fibres will remain free of corrosion despite high chloride contents.

Significant internal crack growth followed by arrest was found at quite low stress intensities, but crack growth rates were relatively low.

40|$|Compressive layers, placed {{within a}} laminate, can arrest cracks. With an {{increasing}} applied stress, the <b>arrested</b> <b>crack</b> can propagate through the compressive layer.

Cracks in pipelines {{are the most}} critical pipe failure mode {{and the cost of}} such an event is always huge depending on when and where it happens.

Full-scale burst test of X 65 UOE pipeline, with 559 mm outer diameter and 13. 5 mm wall thickness, pressurized at 16 MPa by hydrogen gas was conducted. The pipe was 44 m long and cracks were initiated with explosive charges at the mid section.

40|$|Considerable {{improvement}} in the impact toughness of an annealed polypropylene (PP) nanocomposite containing CaCO 3 nanoparticles was achieved and its toughening mechanism was investigated. The nanocomposite was prepared by melt-blending PP and CaCO 3 nanoparticles in a batch mixer. Injection-modeled impact and tensile bars were annealed at 150 degrees C for 2 h prior to the impact and tensile tests. The Young modulus and yield stress of the nanocomposite were found to increase after annealing. What is more, the annealed nanocomposite had much higher impact toughness than its unannealed counterpart. The average Izod impact strength of the 150 degrees C-annealed nanocomposite, containing 20 wt % (7. 8 vol %) CaCO 3 nanoparticles coated with 6 wt % stearic acid, was 168 J/m, which was 3. 5 times {{higher than that of}} neat PP. Experiments, including X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the instrumented falling-weight impact test, were performed to study the toughening mechanism of the annealed nanocomposite. SEM micrographs of the impact fracture surface and bulk morphology underneath the fracture surface of the broken Izod samples and the results of the instrumented failing-weight impact test suggested that the plastic deformation zone that formed in the crack-initiation stage was responsible for the high impact toughness of the annealed nanocomposite. The micromorphology ahead of the <b>arrested</b> <b>crack</b> tip of the annealed nanocomposite showed that the propagation of the crack occurred through shear-to-rupture of the ligaments at the crack opening.

40|$|The {{toughening}} {{mechanism of}} isotactic-polypropylene (iPP) filled with calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) nanoparticles is studied. Good dispersion of the nanoparticles in the iPP matrix was achieved with a monolayer coating of stearic acid on the nanoparticles surface. Two iPPs with different molecular weights (MW) {{were used in}} this study. The impact strength of the high-MW-iPP/ 20 wt% CaCO 3 nanocomposite was increased from 50 to 890 J/m after annealing, which is the highest impact strength of iPP/CaCO 3 nanocomposites ever {{reported in the literature}} so far. The micro-morphology on an <b>arrested</b> <b>crack</b> tip of the annealed nanocomposite revealed that the collective collapse of the strained ligaments at the crack tip was responsible for the formation of macro-cracks and the consequent catastrophic crack propagation. Strong ligaments, which have high fracture stress and were achieved by using the high MW iPP, stabilized the crack initiation process and hence promoted energy dissipation. Moreover, a large number of cavities formed in the annealed nanocomposites after deformation facilitated the shear yielding of the ligaments, leading to massive plastic deformation and remarkable energy dissipation. In addition, a critical nanoparticle concentration, which was corresponding to a brittle-to-ductile transition, was observed in the low-MW-iPP/CaCO 3 nanocomposites. The massive plastic deformation of the ligaments of iPP matrix enabled by the plane-strain to plane-stress transition is concluded to be the toughening mechanism of the PP/CaCO 3 nanocomposites. The scale and the extent of the plastic deformation are determined by the competition between the fracture stress and yield stress of ligaments. A high fracture stress of the ligaments is favorable to stabilize the crack initiation stage and to allow for the expansion of the plastic deformation zone. A lower stress level for yielding is accomplished when the plastic constraint of the ligaments is significantly released. Both the numerous cavities and the nanoparticle concentrations above the critical point significantly release the plastic constraint...|$|E
40|$|Aeroengine {{manufacturers}} have {{to demonstrate that}} critical components such as turbine disks, made of DA Inconel 718, meet the certification requirements in term of fatigue crack growth. In order to be more representative of the in service loading conditions, crack growth under hold time conditions is studied. Modelling crack growth under these conditions is challenging due to the combined effect of fatigue, creep and environment. Under these conditions, established models are often conservative but the degree of conservatism can be reduced by introducing the crack growth threshold in models. Here, the emphasis is laid on the characterization of crack growth rates in the low ΔK regime under hold time conditions and in particular, on the involved crack growth mechanism. Crack growth tests were carried out at high temperature (550 °C to 650 °C) under hold time conditions (up to 1200 s) in the low ΔK regime using a K-decreasing procedure. Scanning electron microscopy was used to identify the fracture mode involved in the low ΔK regime. EBSD analyses and BSE imaging were also carried out along the crack path for a more accurate identification of the fracture mode. A transition from intergranular to transgranular fracture was evidenced in the low ΔK regime and slip bands have also been observed {{at the tip of}} an <b>arrested</b> <b>crack</b> at low ΔK. Transgranular fracture and slip bands are usually observed under pure fatigue loading conditions. At low ΔK, hold time cycles are believed to act as equivalent pure fatigue cycles. This change in the crack growth mechanism under hold time conditions at low ΔK is discussed regarding results related to intergranular crack tip oxidation and its effect on the crack growth behaviour of Inconel 718 alloy. A concept based on an “effective oxygen partial pressure” at the crack tip is proposed to explain the transition from transgranular to intergranular fracture in the low ΔK regime...|$|E
40|$|The {{brittle failure}} {{assessment}} for the {{reactor pressure vessel}} (RPV) of a 1300 MW pressurized water reactor was revised {{according to the state}} of the art. The RPV steel is 22 NiMoCr 37 (A 508 Cl. 2). The expected neutron fluence at the end of license (EOL) after 32 years of full operation is Phi < 2. 3 x 10 (18) neutrons/cm(2). The assessment followed a multibarrier concept to independently prove the exclusion of crack initiation, crack arrest, and exclusion of the load necessary to advance the arrested cracks through the RPV wall. Thermal and structural analyses of the RPV were performed both for the reactor shutdown with postulated upset conditions, as the most severe load case at operation, and for loss of coolant accident (LOCA) conditions. For LOCA transients, a leak size screening of different combinations of cold/hot leg injection of emergency core cooling was performed, and the leading leak size was determined. A fracture mechanics based assessment was carried out for extended circumferential flaws in the weld joint between the RPV shell and the flange, as well as for axial flaws in the nozzle corner. These flaw geometries postulated at locations of the highest principal stresses and lowest temperatures under the respective transient conditions are representative for the brittle failure assessment of the whole vessel. For a normal operation, the maximum crack driving force takes place at high temperatures preceding the upset conditions. The transient follows a load path decreasing with temperature, producing a warm prestressing effect, which is considered in the assessment. Thus, a large safety margin against crack initiation can be demonstrated. At LOCA, the most severe conditions are determined for postulated cracks in the nozzle corner. Here, applying the constraint modified master curve, which takes account of the low stress triaxiality in the component, the exclusion of crack initiation is proven.

40|$|The {{brittle failure}} {{assessment}} for the {{reactor pressure vessel}} (RPV) of a 1300 MW pressurized water reactor (PWR) was revised according to the advanced state of the art. The RPV steel is 22 NiMoCr 37 (A 508 Cl. 2). The expected neutron fluence at End of License (EOL) after 32 years of full operation is Φ < 2. 31018 cm- 2. The assessment followed a multi-barrier concept to prove independently exclusion of crack initiation, crack arrest and exclusion of the load necessary to advance the arrested cracks through the RPV wall. For operational conditions, a combination of shut-down and anomalous operation was proven as the leading transient. This transient follows a load path decreasing with temperature and thus producing a warm pre-stressing for flaws in the RPV. Therefore, a warm pre-stress (WPS) effect is to be considered. For {{loss of coolant accident}} (LOCA) conditions, a leak size screening was performed to find the leading transients. Enveloping transients were determined and used for the brittle failure assessment. As covering crack postulates circumferential cracks in the flange joint to the vessel and axial cracks in the nozzle corner were investigated both under the assumption of a broken clad. For the LOCA loads, the leading leak size was determined by finite element analyses and fracture mechanics based assessment of different combinations of cold/hot leg leak position and cold/hot leg injection of emergency core cooling (ECC). Leading situations are in the flange joint for the cylinder and in the nozzle corner for the flange. In the nozzle corner, high thermal loading from cross corner cooling produces large plastic deformation and loss of constraint. In this situation, the fracture toughness KIC as determined from deeply cracked fracture mechanics specimens is not representative for the component. Thus, loss of constraint in the component was considered by the application of a constraint modified master curve to determine the constraint representative fracture toughness. For the investigated load cases the relevant part of the load paths is at upper shelf temperatures, {{with the exception of the}} anomalous operation starting at 50 °C to lower temperatures. The results of the investigation demonstrate preclusion of initiation for normal and anomalous operation as well as for LOCA loads.

The HSLA- 100 steel, however demonstrated a much higher <b>crack</b> <b>arrest</b> toughness and a correspondingly smaller drop in toughness below the initiation toughness. This small difference between initiation toughness and arrest toughness suggested that the E 1221 procedure, using wedge loaded, compact <b>crack</b> <b>arrest</b> (CCA) specimens would be applicable to this material. Two important issues could then be investigated using this material. First, having completed the expensive and relatively complex testing of the SE(T) specimens using tensile loading and a thermal gradient, a second, quite different geometry could be tested using the E 1221 procedure, allowing an important comparison between the <b>crack</b> <b>arrest</b> measurements made using these two distinct geometries. Historically, obtaining <b>crack</b> <b>arrest</b> results using one test configuration has been so difficult, that there have been very few reports of results for the same material using two different test geometries.

The results suggested {{the existence of an}} upper limit for the normalized 	<b>crack</b> <b>arrest</b> depth, independent of the cylinder material in an engineering sense. Finally, the validity of applying 	ΔKmax ≤ ΔKth as a <b>crack</b> <b>arrest</b> criterion under cyclic thermal shock was confirmed by fatigue tests under mechanical 	loads equivalent to those induced by cyclic thermal shock...|$|R
40|$|Magnesia‐partially‐stabilized {{zirconia}} (Mg‐PSZ) is industrially {{important because}} of transformable metastable tetragonal precipitates which interact with and <b>arrest</b> <b>cracks.</b> This work addresses {{the precipitation of}} tetragonal phases at one composition, 9. 5 mol% MgO, throughout a range of temperatures. High‐purity zirconia samples were sintered at 1700 °C and rapidly quenched to heat‐treatment temperatures ranging from 1600 ° to 1100 °C, then quenched to room temperature. Cooling rates through the tetragonal + MgO and the monoclinic + MgO two‐phase regions were found to affect the phase content. The kinetics of nonequilibrium phase transformation for high‐purity Mg‐PSZ are presented in terms of time‐temperature‐transformation diagrams. Copyrigh...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} has demonstrated that through-the-thickness stitching provides major improvements in the damage tolerance of composite laminates loaded in compression. However, the brittle nature of polymer matrix composites makes them susceptible to damage propagation, requiring special material applications and designs to limit damage growth. Glass buffer strips, embedded within laminates, have shown the potential for improving the damage tolerance of unstitched composite laminates loaded in tension. The glass buffer strips, less stiff than the surrounding carbon fibers, <b>arrest</b> <b>crack</b> growth in composites under tensile loads. The present study investigates the damage tolerance characteristics of laminates that contain both stitching and glass buffer strips...|$|R
40|$|Growth of a microstructurally short {{edge crack}} in the {{neighbourhood}} of a grain boundary has been studied using a dislocation technique. Influence of {{the distance between the}} crack tip and a high-angle grain boundary was studied for 5000 load cycles. Growth rate was found to change stepwise during crack advance, both accelerating and decelerating, and finally retarding before <b>crack</b> <b>arrest.</b> <b>Crack</b> propagation is ruled by the competition between the shielding effect from the dislocations in the plastic zone and the stress field increase due to crack extension, and clearly shows a discrete behaviour at growth below the fatigue threshold load...|$|R
