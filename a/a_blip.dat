5|$|Starting in 1940, British {{aircraft}} {{were increasingly}} {{equipped with the}} IFF Mk. II system, which allowed radar operators to determine whether <b>a</b> <b>blip</b> on their screen was a friendly aircraft. IFF was a responder that sent out a pulse of radio signal immediately on reception of a radio signal from a radar system. The IFF's transmission mixed with the radar's own pulse, causing the blip to stretch out in time from a small peak to an extended rectangular shape.|$|E
5|$|Each {{receiver}} antenna {{was sent to}} one of the channels of the displays in turn, causing one of the displays to refresh. For instance, at a given instant the switch might be set to send the signal to {{the left side of the}} azimuth display. The timebase generator was triggered to start sweeping the CRT dot up the screen after the transmission ended. Reflections would cause the dot to be deflected to the left, creating <b>a</b> <b>blip</b> whose vertical location could be measured against a scale to determine range. The switch would then move to the next position and cause the right-hand side of the display to be redrawn, but the signal inverted so the dot moved to the right. The switching occurred fast enough that the display looked continuous.|$|E
25|$|By 1984, {{the first}} of ten {{knock-out}} cup successes had been achieved, {{at the expense of}} Bristol. Bath dominated the John Player Cup winning it four years on a trot, from 1984 to 1987. The cup sponsor changed to Pilkington, and Bath after <b>a</b> <b>blip</b> in 1988 dominated that cup as well winning it a further six times.|$|E

5000|$|Blip Magazine is the reinvention of Mississippi Review Online, a {{personal}} website put online in 1995 by {{the editor of}} Mississippi Review, Frederick Barthelme. <b>As</b> <b>Blip,</b> it is the online heir of Mississippi Review (established by Barthelme in 1977). During Barthelme's time as editor, Raymond Carver said Mississippi Review [...] "is {{one of the most}} remarkable and indispensable literary journals of our time.". The editors working on Mississippi Review prior to 2010 moved to Blip with Barthelme after he left the University of Southern Mississippi.|$|R

The Recording Industry Association of America did not institute its gold record certification program until 1958, by which point Crosby's record sales were barely <b>a</b> <b>blip.</b> Before that, gold records were awarded by an artist's own record company. Universal Music, current owner of Crosby's Decca catalog, has never requested RIAA certification for any of his hit singles.|$|E
25|$|Staccato {{lightning}} is a cloud-to-ground lightning (CG) strike {{which is}} a short-duration stroke that (often but not always) appears as a single very bright flash and often has considerable branching. These are often found in the visual vault area near the mesocyclone of rotating thunderstorms and coincides with intensification of thunderstorm updrafts. A similar cloud-to-cloud strike consisting of a brief flash over a small area, appearing like <b>a</b> <b>blip,</b> also occurs in a similar area of rotating updrafts.|$|E
25|$|The range {{signal was}} {{received}} {{on a single}} half-wave dipole mounted at {{the middle of the}} horizontal antenna array, fed into a four-tube RF receiver, and then into a four-tube intermediate frequency (IF) system. The output was fed directly into the lower Y-axis plate of one of the two CRTs. The upper plate on the Y-axis was fed the output of a calibrator, allowing it to be adjusted so the beam was centred vertically. Signals being received from the antenna would thus cause the beam to deflect downward to produce <b>a</b> <b>blip,</b> {{as in the case of}} Chain Home.|$|E

500|$|... "Blow" [...] is {{a five-minute}} and nine-second disco-influenced, R, funk, retro-soul song with an electro-funk groove and a jazz-influenced opening. Critics also found {{elements}} of [...] "chilly" [...] neo-disco {{in the groove}} with Rolling Stone writer Rob Sheffield further noting that it created an [...] "air of melancholy". Instrumentally it is complete with a heavy bass, sparse piano chords and guitars altogether creating <b>a</b> <b>blipping,</b> marching and parping beat. Kevin Fallon from The Daily Beast described the song's production as [...] "so bouncy it's almost coyish and flirty" [...] and added {{that it was a}} counterbalance to the [...] "raunchy" [...] lyrics.|$|R
25|$|Gerry Canavan {{argues that}} Wild Seed {{challenges}} conventional fantasies of race by having Doro’s eugenics project supersede that of Europe’s by millennia. In this “alternate history,” “America itself--now transformed into <b>a</b> <b>blip</b> between the secret history of Doro's experiments and the brutal aftermath of their horrible success--becomes retold here as an African story, in an Africanist recentering {{of history that}} serves as a strongly anti-colonialist provocation, even if the results are mostly anti-utopian.” Still, while Doro’s eugenic project turns out a “superpowered blackness” that negates notions of white supremacy, his exploitation of his people as mere genetic experiments echoes the breeding methods of New World slave owners, thus replicating the actual history of racial slavery practiced by the Western world.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, the spiral-can {{system was}} {{essentially}} a rotating version of a conventional A-scope display. In the A-scope, a time base generator pulls the CRT beam across the screen horizontally, and blips indicate the range to the target along the line the radar is currently pointed. For spiral-scan the only difference was that the line was no longer always horizontal, but was rotating around {{the face of the}} display at the same speed as the dish. Blips on the screen now indicated two values, the angle of the target relative to the centreline, and the range to the target represented by the distance from the centre. What was lost in this display was a direct indication of magnitude of the angle from the centre; <b>a</b> <b>blip</b> to the upper right indicated the target was in that direction but did not directly indicate if it was five, ten or twenty degrees off.|$|E
25|$|According to Pelin, {{he walked}} to the upper sector console holding JP550's flight {{progress}} strip. He asked Tasić if the DC-9 could climb to FL350. Tasić took the strip from Pelin and looked at it, then asked where the aircraft was at the moment. Pelin then pointed to <b>a</b> <b>blip</b> on the screen approaching Kostajnica. Tasić's response was 'yes, it could climb'. Pelin then noticed an aircraft on the screen coming from the direction of Metlika and asked Tasić about it, who said 'wait until they cross'. Pelin referred to the middle-sector screen {{to make sure that he}} had identified the DC-9 positively on the upper-sector screen. He then returned to Tasić and they both watched the targets pass each other, at which point Tasić authorised JP550 to climb. Pelin then called out to Erjavec and said 'yes, climb it'. Upon Erjavec receiving the OK from Pelin, he instructed the DC-9 to climb to FL350. That was at 10:07:40.|$|E
5000|$|... 24 June 1943: Lieutenant Reese {{and crew}} {{disappeared}} while on convoy patrol 700 mi northeast of Argentia. Reese had reported <b>a</b> radar <b>blip</b> and came {{through a very}} heavy overcast to investigate. No further messages were received. On {{the next day in}} clear weather, three huge icebergs were seen in the area. The squadron learned from this incident that when investigating <b>an</b> isolated radar <b>blip</b> in bad weather, always allow a five-degree offset on the radar scope until a visual contact is obtained.|$|R

25|$|Anthony {{commuted}} to Towson Catholic High School for {{his first}} three years of high school. During the summer of 1999, Anthony grew five inches into the frame of a 6–5 swingman. He suddenly became one of the area's top players and {{made a name for himself}} in the area, being named The Baltimore Suns metro player of the year in 2001, as well as Baltimore Catholic League player of the year. During his sophomore year, he averaged 14 points, 5 rebounds, 4 assists and 2 steals. Towson Catholic surged to a record of 26–3 and finished third in the state tournament. Anthony enjoyed a successful high school basketball career as a junior, almost doubling his numbers in scoring and rebounds, averaging 23 points and 10.3 rebounds. Despite his successful year, Anthony was distracted by all of the attention, and was suspended on several occasions for skipping classes. He barely registered <b>a</b> <b>blip</b> on the radars of pro scouts with his skinny frame and lack of strength; many scouts felt that he was not ready for the physical demands of the NBA. In the end, Towson Catholic fell short of the state title, although he was named Baltimore's County Player of the Year, All-Metropolitan Player of the Year and Baltimore Catholic League Player of the Year.|$|E
500|$|In the 1930s, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was {{the most}} {{respected}} movie production studio in Hollywood. When Tracy arrived there, his own reputation was not strong. Biographer James Curtis writes: [...] "Tracy was scarcely <b>a</b> <b>blip</b> on the box office barometer in 1935, a critics' darling and little more". He was, however, well known for being a troublemaker. Producer Irving G. Thalberg was nevertheless enthusiastic about working with the actor, telling journalist Louella Parsons: [...] "Spencer Tracy will become one of MGM's most valuable stars." ...|$|E

Arsenal began the following season impressively, winning 0–4 at PSV Eindhoven. The match set a new club record, as midfielder Gilberto Silva scored the fastest goal, in 20.07 seconds. Although Arsenal lost their last two matches against Borussia Dortmund and Auxerre, coinciding with <b>a</b> <b>blip</b> in form domestically, they qualified for the second group stage for the third consecutive season. Striker Thierry Henry scored his first hat-trick in Europe for Arsenal against Roma on 27 November 2002 with the player stating; [...] "It's wonderful to score a hat-trick but it's even more important that I did so in a game we've won."

John Barrowman and Gareth David-Lloyd opined {{in an interview at}} Comic-Con to fan questions that Jack's relationship with Ianto has however brought out Jack's empathy, and helped to ground him. John Barrowman {{said in an interview that}} Ianto [...] "brings out the [...] "human" [...] in [...] " [...] and [...] "brings out more ... empathy because he’s actually fallen for someone and he really cares about somebody ... makes him warm to other people ... makes him more approachable." [...] In the same interview, Gareth David-Lloyd said of the relationship and his character that [...] "I think Ianto’s always made him care and that is really the heart of the show." [...] However, Stephen James Walker feels that Jack's relationship with Ianto is one-sided; Ianto seems to feel the relationship is [...] "serious and committed", but while dancing with Gwen in [...] "Something Borrowed", Walker believes that Jack appears to equate his relationship with Ianto to nothing more than a [...] "recreational activity", and considers it [...] "obvious Jack only has eyes and thoughts for Gwen". The novel The House that Jack Built includes a scene where Ianto confides in Gwen that he knows that to Jack he is [...] "just a shag", though discloses that the relationship means more to him. In the same novel, however, he also refers to himself in front of Jack as his [...] "boyfriend". When Ianto expounds these same insecurities to Jack in the radio play [...] "The Dead Line" [...] (just prior to Children of Earth), however, Jack insists [...] "You will never be just <b>a</b> <b>blip</b> in time, Ianto Jones.

The operator would then [...] "swing the gonio", or [...] "hunt", back and forth until the selected blip reached its minimum deflection on this display (or maximum, at 90 degrees off). The operator would measure the distance against the scale, and then tell the plotter the range and bearing of the selected target. The operator would then select <b>a</b> different <b>blip</b> on the display and repeat the process. For targets at different altitudes, the operator might have to try different antennas to maximize the signal.|$|R
