2500|$|While the SA22/FB was a purer sports car, the FC tended {{toward the}} softer sport-tourer trends of its day, sharing some {{similarities}} with the HB series Cosmo. Handling was much improved, with {{less of the}} oversteer tendencies of the FB. The rear end design was vastly improved from the FB's live rear axle to a more modern, Independent Rear Suspension (rear axle). Steering was more precise, with {{rack and pinion steering}} replacing the old recirculating ball steering of the FB. Disc brakes also became standard, with some models (S4: Sport, GXL, GTU, Turbo II, Convertible; S5: GXL, GTUs, Turbo, Convertible) offering four-piston front brakes. The rear seats were optional in some models of the FC RX-7, but are not commonly found in the American Market. Mazda also introduced Dynamic Tracking Suspension System (DTSS) in the 2nd generation RX-7. The revised independent rear suspension incorporated special toe control hubs which were capable of introducing a limited degree of passive rear steering under cornering loads. The DTSS worked by allowing a slight amount of toe-out under normal driving conditions but induced slight toe-in under heavier cornering loads at around 0.5 Gs or more; toe-out in the rear allows for a more responsive rotation of the rear, but toe-in allowed for a more stable rear under heavier cornering. [...] Mazda also introduced Auto Adjusting Suspension (AAS) in the 2nd generation RX-7. The system changed damping characteristics according to the road and driving conditions. [...] The system compensated for camber changes and provided anti-dive and <b>anti-squat</b> effects.|$|E
5000|$|The DW-link uses <b>anti-squat</b> to {{eliminate}} [...] "suspension bob." [...] Squat {{is defined as}} the tendency of rear suspension to compress under acceleration. The <b>anti-squat</b> used in the DW-link system is achieved by a minimisation of torque about the centre of mass. The DW-link system has also been designed to minimise pedal feedback caused by suspension travel.|$|E

5000|$|As per its 2011 {{election}} programme, the Berlin Pirate Party advocates {{the promotion}} of alternative residential projects and cultural institutions {{as well as the}} preservation of open spaces in inner-city areas. It also opposes the so-called [...] "Berlin Line" [...] low-tolerance <b>anti-squatting</b> policy. The party is also in favor of a ticket-less public transport system in Berlin. The successful [...] "Referendum on Disclosing Partial Privatizations of the Berlin Waterworks" [...] (Volksentscheid über die Offenlegung der Teilprivatisierungsverträge bei den Berliner Wasserbetrieben) was supported by the Berlin Pirates. For Berlin schools, the party also supports ethical education on drug use ("Drug Maturity" [...] model). The party also wants to remove the minimum voting age clause for Berlin state parliament elections. In addition, three chapters of their party's basic program are devoted to animal welfare.|$|R
5000|$|Forward {{acceleration}} <b>anti-squat</b> {{is calculated}} {{in a similar}} manner and with the same relationship between percentage and weight transfer. <b>Anti-squat</b> values of 100% and more are commonly used in drag racing, but values of 50% or less are more common in cars that have to undergo severe braking. Higher values of <b>anti-squat</b> commonly cause wheel hop during braking. It is important to note that, while the value of 100% means that all of the weight transfer is being carried through the suspension linkage. However, {{this does not mean that}} the suspension is incapable of carrying additional loads (aerodynamic, cornering, etc.) during an episode of braking or forward acceleration. In other words, no [...] "binding" [...] of the suspension is to be implied.|$|E

5000|$|Dave Weagle's [...] "DW-link" [...] {{is another}} four-bar {{suspension}} system with two relatively short links, here they typically co-rotate. It {{is characterized by}} an <b>anti-squat</b> response that varies with suspension travel and is designed to reduce loss of energy resulting from squat during pedaling. It typically has higher <b>anti-squat</b> {{at the beginning of}} suspension travel, and less thereafter. The DW-link was originally used by Iron Horse bicycle company. After they went out of business in 2009, the DW-link suspension design was up for grabs.The DW-link is now licensed to Ibis, Independent Fabrication, Turner Suspension Bicycles, and Pivot Cycles.|$|E
50|$|The W201 {{featured}} a patented rear 5-link suspension, subsequently used in E and C class models, {{front and rear}} anti-roll bars, anti-dive and <b>anti-squat</b> geometry—as well as available airbags, ABS brakes and seatbelt pretensioners.|$|E
50|$|The FPA cars feature fully {{independent}} suspension {{based on a}} double wishbone design, with geometry which includes <b>anti-squat</b> and anti-dive pushrod operation. Ohlins two-way adjustable dampers, along with adjustable anti-roll bars complete the suspension system.|$|E
50|$|The {{front and}} rear {{suspension}} is of a double wishbone and pushrod operated twin coil over damper construction. Adjustable ride height, cambers and toe, as well as anti-dive and <b>anti-squat</b> made to optimise drive control.|$|E
5000|$|The DW-link uses an <b>anti-squat</b> {{suspension}} {{design to}} counteract forces responsible for [...] "suspension bob" [...] and consequently removes {{the need for}} excessive compression damping. This allows the suspension {{to be much more}} active over low-speed impacts, allowing more traction.|$|E
5000|$|Weagle's design {{currently}} holds multiple patents, including US7128329, {{which is}} the world's first and remains {{to be the only}} published account on the method of mathematically and geometrically characterizing linkage chain/ belt-driven, and shaft-driven motorcycle and bicycle suspensions. The 7128329 introduced several new concepts and measurements to the suspension world, specifically the concept of characterizing <b>anti-squat</b> as a curve or area when graphed as a function of <b>anti-squat</b> versus compressive travel. The portfolio also proposed the same basic measurement for braking squat versus compressive travel distance. These measurements are now accepted as [...] "anti-squat curves" [...] and [...] "braking squat curves" [...] by some professionals in the field of vehicle suspension dynamics.|$|E
50|$|The {{method of}} {{determining}} the anti-dive or <b>anti-squat</b> depends on whether the suspension linkages react to the torque of braking and accelerating. For example, with inboard brakes and half-shaft driven rear wheels, the suspension linkages do not, but with outboard brakes and a swing-axle driveline, they do.|$|E
5000|$|Bob and squat {{refer to}} how a suspension, usually rear, {{responds}} to rider pedalling. Squat usually refers {{to how the}} rear end sinks under acceleration, and bob refers to repeated squat and rebound with each pedal stroke. Both are undesirable characteristics as they rob power from pedalling. Many suspension systems incorporate anti-bob, <b>anti-squat,</b> or [...] "platform" [...] damping to help eliminate bob.|$|E
50|$|Anti-dive and <b>anti-squat</b> are {{percentages}} {{that indicate}} {{the degree to}} which the front dives under braking and the rear squats under acceleration. They can be thought of as the counterparts for braking and acceleration, as jacking forces are to cornering. The main reason for the difference is due to the different design goals between front and rear suspension, whereas suspension is usually symmetrical between the left and right of the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|The DB9 also {{contains}} anti-roll bars and double wishbone suspension, supported by coil springs. To keep the back-end in control under heavy acceleration or braking, the rear suspension has additional <b>anti-squat</b> and anti-lift technology.

50|$|The {{race was}} won by Lotus-Ford driver Jochen Rindt {{in his new}} monocoque-chassis Type 72, which had only raced twice before (but in a {{different}} spec); and this came 3 years after the 72's predecessor; DFV-debutant Type 49 in 1967 won first time out {{at exactly the same}} track with Jim Clark driving. Rindt racing the 72 without the complex <b>anti-squat</b> and anti-dive features, which the Austrian had never believed in, effortlessly dominated the practice and race putting little pressure on the car and not even having to use the maxinum road width or line. Chapman persisted with <b>anti-squat</b> and dive on John Miles' 72 which was fifth on the first lap and proved difficult to pass. Miles finally being passed by Beltoise on lap 49 and Surtees, 4 laps from the flag. The race saw the significant debut of Clay Regazzoni in the second Ferrari, the Italian marque looking truly competitive {{for the first time in}} years. However the race was marred by the fatal accident of British driver Piers Courage driving the Frank Williams-entered De Tomaso-Ford.|$|E
50|$|The rear {{suspension}} was fully independent, with double wishbone and radius arm configuration, incorporating <b>anti-squat</b> characteristics. The car was fitted with Armstrong adjustable dampers and spring platform adjustment. Coil springs were used. A separate adjustable anti-roll bar {{was included in}} the suspension. Outboard drive-shafts were hollowed out to reduce unsprung weight. Rear hub carriers were made of magnesium cast. The suspension operates entirely on adjustable rod-ends with provision for toe-in and camber adjustments.|$|E
50|$|The brakes are {{ventilated}} carbon ceramic discs, 398 mm six-piston callipers in {{the front}} and 360 mm four-piston callipers in the rear. The suspension is a lightweight aluminium front subframe with hollow castings with independent double wishbones incorporating anti-dive geometry, coil springs, anti-roll bar, and monotube adaptive dampers {{in the front}} and independent double wishbones with <b>anti-squat</b> and anti-lift geometry, coil springs, anti-roll bar, and monotube adaptive dampers in the rear. It has a three-stage adjustable adaptive damping system including normal, sport and track modes. The tires are Pirelli P Zeros, 255/ZR20 {{in the front and}} 305/30 ZR20 in the rear.|$|E
50|$|The HB used a {{completely}} different suspension design from the HA, having double-wishbone and coil springs with integrated telescopic dampers at the front, and trailing arms and coil springs at the rear. Lateral location and <b>anti-squat</b> of the rear axle was achieved using upper trailing arms mounted at approximately 45° fixed to lugs {{at the top of}} the differential. Both front and rear could also be fitted with optional anti-roll bars. The HB set new standards for handling in its class as a result of the adoption of this suspension design, where many of its contemporaries stuck with leaf springs and MacPherson struts.|$|E
50|$|This {{variation}} of single pivot suspension places the pivot {{in front of}} and above the bottom bracket, at a height above the smallest chainring or higher. This gives the design {{a significant amount of}} <b>anti-squat</b> when pedaling in smaller chainrings, which helps reduce loss of energy due to squat. This is of particular importance on steep climbs, when one would use the smaller chainrings. However, this is a trade-off since the pivot's placement causes the design to suffer more from pedal kickback. Notable examples are Santa Cruz's Heckeler and Superlight as well as Orange's entire line of full suspensions.|$|E
5000|$|The dw-link {{design is}} {{engineered}} {{to balance the}} effects of acceleration and braking forces {{in order to improve}} traction and efficiency. It uses a kinematic suspension force called [...] "position sensitive anti-squat." [...] When a vehicle accelerates the suspension reacts (typically in the form of suspension compression) to a phenomenon called load transfer. The position-sensitive <b>anti-squat</b> of dw-link offsets the rearward load transfer that happens during vehicle acceleration. This unique attribute is mathematically proven to reduce efficiency losses, while improving traction, and bump sensitivity, and if properly engineered, will help minimize perceptible pedal feedback, when compared to other methods of achieving a similar offset of load transfer.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the front}} {{anti-dive}} geometry which was introduded on the Lotus 31, and the rear <b>anti-squat</b> geometry with unparallel radius arms (that counters the rear camber and toe-in reductions under braking) which was introduced with the 41C, were fully developed on the 41X (which had multiple suspension arm attachment points), and the setup {{found to be}} the best is incorporated into the 59 frame. While the 59 used Triumph Herald front uprights, the 59B used the Formula Two version Lotus 41X uprights and brakes shared with Lotus 47A. Hubs and wheels were knock-off type with spin-on central lock nut, except for the Formula Ford version, which had the Ford production 4 lugnut configuration as per the formula.|$|E
5000|$|Recreational {{mountain}} biker Dave Weagle {{used his}} background in four-wheeled vehicle suspension dynamics {{to investigate the}} linkage axle path of bicycle suspension systems. The analysis method that Weagle developed stands as the first published text on the analysis of linkage suspension systems for chain driven wheels. Weagle's research was directed towards what is known among mountain bikers as [...] "suspension bob." [...] Analysis revealed that the [...] "bob" [...] {{was a result of}} the combined effects of load transfer during acceleration and the unbalanced forces of the rider's legs moving up and down. It was realized that the use of <b>anti-squat</b> could counteract the load transfer and pedaling induced forces that produced [...] "suspension bob" [...] and limited traction.|$|E
50|$|Chapman's efforts {{produced}} one of {{the most}} remarkable and successful designs in F1 history. Taking the stressed engine layout technique from the Lotus 49 and adding advanced aerodynamics produced a car that was years ahead of its rivals. To begin with however, problems with the handling of the car had to be overcome, due to a lack of 'feel' caused by the anti-dive suspension geometry - which was designed to prevent the nose of the car dipping significantly under braking - and the <b>anti-squat</b> set-up at the rear, which was supposed to stop the car 'squatting down' under acceleration. Once the suspension was modified, there were no further problems. The car caused a sensation amongst the media and fans, with many people clamouring to see the remarkable car in action.|$|E
5000|$|In 2005 Traxxas {{released}} the Jato (pronounced Jay-toe) 2.5 (usually {{referred to as}} simply [...] "Jato"), which was a completely new design {{that was based on}} the 1/10 scale rear wheel drive stadium truck format popular in the industry, and it replaced the Nitro Rustler as Traxxas' high end stadium truck. It was powered by the same TRX 2.5 nitro engine as the Nitro Rustler but had many new high tech features, some borrowed from the Revo, that set it apart. One of the new features was a sophisticated 2-speed automatic transmission, that improved acceleration and top speed over the single speed Nitro Rustler. A new suspension design was another new feature. It included new [...] "GTR" [...] shocks and springs, which were borrowed from the Revo, but used in a traditional configuration instead of the Revo's push-rod configuration. The suspension also included front and rear mounting points for optional sway bars, which were offered as Traxxas accessories in three different thicknesses. The suspension was also fully adjustable for camber, caster, toe, <b>anti-squat,</b> and ride height. Other notable features included 2.8 inch wheels and tires, a sealed limited slip differential, rubber sealed drive shafts and ball bearings, steering assembly, Revo spec slipper clutch, and hex hardware. It has a claimed top speed of 55+MPH.|$|E
50|$|At the knuckle end, single {{ball joints}} are {{typically}} used, {{in which case}} the steering loads have to be taken via a steering arm, and the wishbones look A- or L-shaped. An L-shaped arm is generally preferred on passenger vehicles because it allows a better compromise of handling and comfort to be tuned in. The bushing in line with the wheel can be kept relatively stiff to effectively handle cornering loads while the off-line joint can be softer to allow the wheel to recess under fore-aft impact loads. For a rear suspension, a pair of joints can be used {{at both ends of the}} arm, making them more H-shaped in plan view. Alternatively, a fixed-length driveshaft can perform the function of a wishbone as long as the shape of the other wishbone provides control of the upright. This arrangement has been successfully used in the Jaguar IRS. In elevation view, the suspension is a 4-bar link, and it is easy to work out the camber gain (see camber angle) and other parameters for a given set of bushing or ball-joint locations. The various bushings or ball joints do not have to be on horizontal axes, parallel to the vehicle centre line. If they are set at an angle, then anti-dive and <b>anti-squat</b> geometry can be dialled in.|$|E

The Turbo 2 also has an air-to-air intercooler which has a dedicated intake on the hood. The intake is slightly offset toward {{the left side of the}} hood.|$|E
50|$|After Graham Hill {{had broken}} his legs in late 1969, {{he did not}} return to Team Lotus, driving Lotus cars for the Rob Walker Racing Team instead. Miles was {{promoted}} to number two Lotus F1 driver behind Jochen Rindt for the 1970 Formula One season. In the 1970 South African Grand Prix, where a total of five Lotus cars were entered, he finished fifth in a Lotus 49 with Hill behind him. Miles had driven most of the race with petrol leaking over him, but Colin Chapman expressed dissatisfaction he had not taken Beltoise for fourth. For the Spanish GP, the new Lotus 72 was entered, but Miles failed to qualify for the race in which Rindt had to retire early. Due to the problems with the 72, the updated Lotus 49C was used in Monaco, with Miles driving a few practice laps in the 72, and failing to qualify in the 49C. Graham Hill was slower in practice, but had a guaranteed grid place as a past World Champion, and was allocated Miles' 49C for the race, which was won by Rindt. In Belgium, Miles raced the 72, while Rindt relied on the old 49C, and both had to retire. In Zandvoort, the 72 finally proved to be competitive, with Rindt qualifying on pole and winning, while Miles qualified and finished seventh in the race, driving a more experimental and difficult, version of the 72, which retained much of Chapman's <b>anti-squat</b> and anti-dive roadholding features, and was a handful, if having excellent brakes. Miles made an excellent start, jumping into fifth and was running in the opening laps with 8 of the greatest GP drivers nose to tail, held behind by good line, brakes and skilful blocking or the luck of a tyro in auto sport. Regazzoni got past when Miles missed a gear on lap 6 and Piers Courage passed Miles on lap 12. Frustrated, Courage, notorious for overdriving, was killed a few laps later. After that an intense midfield duel developed as Miles fought to hold off Jean-Pierre Beltoise and John Surtees. Rindt required real skill to lap the trio threading through on laps 30-33, ultimately just flagged past by his teammate. Beltoise was not able to get the Matra past the deep braking Miles' 72 until the slippery lap 49, John Surtees also got past on the lap, but was immediately retaken by the Miles 72 and Big John did not finally secure the 6th place point, until he got past 4 laps from the flag with the 72's brakes effectively gone. In France, Rindt won again in the 72 despite an injury, while Miles finished outside the points once again, although on the same lap as his team leader.|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{deals with}} the suspension of a lightweight medium-class vehicle for four passengers with a curb weight of 1000 kg. The suspension layout consists of a transversal leaf spring and is supported by an active air spring which {{is included in the}} damper. The lower control arms are replaced by the leaf spring ends. Active ride height control is introduced to compensate for different vehicle load states. Active steering is applied using electric linear actuators with steer-by wire design. Besides intense use of light material the inquiry should investigate whether elimination of suspension parts or a lighter component is concordant with the stability demands of the vehicle. The investigation is based on simulations obtained with MSC Software ADAMS/Car and Matlab. The suspension is modeled in Adams/Car and has to proof it's compliance in normal driving conditions and under extreme forces. Evaluation criteria are suspension kinematics and compliance such as camber, caster and toe change during wheel travel in different load states. Also the leaf spring deflection, anti-dive and <b>anti-squat</b> measures and brake force distribution are investigated. Based on a simplified version of the leaf spring suspension design a full vehicle model is created. The comparison between the suspension models evaluates the same basic suspension parameters to ensure the compliance. Additionally roll rate and understeer gradient are investigated. It can be shown that the vehicle equipped with transversal leaf spring instead of lower control arms fulfils the set kinematics and compliance requirements. Road holding performance is assured for normal driving conditions on public roads...|$|E
