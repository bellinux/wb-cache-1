500|$|... "Rock with U" [...] is a [...] "digitized form" [...] of pop song {{which draws}} {{influence}} from Euro disco. According to Jackson, it {{is reminiscent of}} [...] "Together Again" [...] or [...] "Throb" [...] from The Velvet Rope (1997) and janet. (1993), respectively. [...] "It's still classic me but with a different twist to it – a modern twist", she said. Jim Farber from New York Daily News noted the song's riffs, which he considered greater when they first appeared in Madonna's 1985 song [...] "Into the Groove". The song was compared to Jackson's brother Michael Jackson's [...] "Rock with You" [...] (1979), due to its disco themes. [...] "Rock with U" [...] also contains vocodered whispers <b>and</b> <b>murmured</b> vocals. The song opens with the line, [...] "Strobe lights make everything sexier," [...] while it talks about an erotic proposition which was reportedly dedicated to the gay community.|$|E
500|$|He later explained, [...] "In a nutshell, Brian wrote {{most of the}} music, and I {{composed}} most of {{the vocal}} melodies and lyrics, and then sang them." [...] If Byrne's vocal harmonies were radical enough, Eno would revise the instrumentation to accompany it, but Byrne avoided writing instrumentation and chose {{to adapt to the}} instrumentals as written. Using a style similar to the Talking Heads album SpeakinginTongues, Byrne scatted <b>and</b> <b>murmured</b> some lyrics before they were completed, due to Byrne's preference for the sonic quality of lyrics rather than their literal meaning and his method of writing lyrics using free association. In composing lyrics for the album, Byrne attempted to write keeping in mind what would please Eno as his collaborator. He also attempted to write harmonies for Eno, who decided against singing any lead vocals on the album. Eno does perform backing vocals throughout the album, which he credits on one track as [...] "inhumanpiano" ...|$|E

500|$|Now on foot, {{the knights}} drew swords and {{returned}} to battle, Le Gris again proving stronger than his opponent and slowly gaining the upper hand. After several minutes of engagement, Carrouges slipped and Le Gris was able to stab his rival through the right thigh. As the crowd gasped <b>and</b> <b>murmured,</b> Le Gris stepped back to view his opponent's injury and Carrouges desperately counter-attacked, wrestling Le Gris to the ground. Le Gris' heavy armour prevented him from regaining his feet and Carrouges repeatedly stabbed at his floored opponent, his blows denting but not puncturing the thick plate steel. Realising that his sword was inadequate, Carrouges straddled Le Gris and used the handle of his dagger to smash the lock holding Le Gris' faceplate in position. Even as his opponent struggled beneath him, Carrouges tore the plate off and demanded that Le Gris admit his guilt. Le Gris refused and cried out [...] "In the name of God and on the peril and damnation of my soul, I am innocent". Infuriated, Carrouges drove his dagger through Le Gris' neck, killing him instantly.|$|E
2500|$|In 1955 Jack Philby {{returned}} {{to live in}} Riyadh. In 1960, {{on a visit to}} Kim in Beirut, he suddenly became ill and was rushed to hospital. [...] "The man whose life had been so eventful and panoramic, so daring and theatrical, now lay unconcious. He awoke only for a moment <b>and</b> <b>murmured</b> to his son, [...] "I am so bored." [...] And then he expired."". [...] He is buried in the Muslim cemetery in the Basta district of Beirut. His tombstone reads, [...] "Greatest of Arabian Explorers".|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Curts rushed to Pacific Fleet headquarters, where he was standing beside Kimmel when a spent [...]50 caliber machine gun bullet crashed through a glass window and bounced harmlessly off Kimmel's chest, leaving a dark stain on the admiral's white uniform. Kimmel picked the bullet up off the floor <b>and</b> <b>murmured,</b> more to himself than to Curts, [...] "It would have been merciful had it killed me." [...] This incident was depicted in the 1970 film by Richard Fleischer, [...] "Tora! Tora! Tora!." [...] Martin Balsam portrayed Adm. Husband E. Kimmel, and G.D. Spradlin played [...] "Germany" [...] Curts.|$|E
