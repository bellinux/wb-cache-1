25|$|Besides the Perejil Island, the Spanish-held territories {{claimed by}} other {{countries}} are two: Morocco claims the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla and the plazas de soberanía islets off the northern coast of Africa; and Portugal and the other signatories of the Treaty of Vienna(1815) and their successor states do not recognise Spain's sovereignty over the territory of Olivenza in the Alentejo region of Portugal which was annexed by Spain in 1801. Portugal considers the territory to be a single concelho and its freguesias {{to be part of}} the historical Portuguese mainland territory.
