5|$|After I {{released}} my solo record I {{felt really}} disappointed, I {{believed in the}} record I made but if you don't have the back-up of your record company investing and marketing it. It's <b>a</b> <b>really</b> tough job and because I wrote the whole thing I really believed in this record, as did Nellee Hooper, I was jaded and disappointed.|$|E
5|$|Strapping Young Lad was a Canadian extreme metal band {{formed by}} Devin Townsend in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1994. The band {{started as a}} one-man studio project; Townsend played most of the {{instruments}} on the 1995 debut album, Heavy as <b>a</b> <b>Really</b> Heavy Thing. By 1997, he had recruited permanent members; this line-up, which consisted of Townsend on vocals and guitar, Jed Simon on guitar, Byron Stroud on bass, and Gene Hoglan on drums, lasted until the band's dissolution.|$|E
5|$|The remastered 10th anniversary {{edition of}} City was {{released}} on June 7, 2007, in similar vein to the 2006 remaster of Heavy as <b>a</b> <b>Really</b> Heavy Thing, with bonus tracks and extended liner notes by Townsend. A career spanning best of album, entitled 1994–2006 Chaos Years, {{was released on}} March 31, 2008, with a bonus DVD of live performances {{and all of the}} band's music videos.|$|E

5|$|There's {{something}} special about that first single, we were never quite able to recapture that sound. I don't {{know if it was}} the guitars or the recording. It was just <b>a</b> <b>really</b> gnarly, gnarly guitar sound. We've gotten some since, but they've been a different kind. I think it {{had more to do with}} the actual electromagnetic chemistry of what was going through our amps that day. It was just a cool, fried-out sound.|$|E
5|$|We {{went into}} the booth to record the song. She {{originally}} {{wanted to do a}} Mike Skinner thing, rapping the verse and singing the chorus. But I asked her to sing it all, and she just made up the whole melody on the spot, and sang this amazing solo. At that moment I realised that this girl has <b>a</b> <b>really</b> special gift.|$|E
5|$|A {{scene in}} the episode shows Grampa and Bart driving to Branson with Marge's car, {{listening}} to the radio. Because the scene consists entirely of auditive gags, the Simpsons staff had difficulty figuring out what to show visually during the scene. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, Jean explained that these scenes “get <b>a</b> <b>really</b> big laugh at the table,” but are subsequently hard for the animators. The scene makes use of a repeated background, an animation technique made famous by Hanna-Barbera in order to cut budget.|$|E

5|$|After {{performing}} {{in a number}} of heavy metal bands in high school, Townsend was discovered by a record label in 1993 and was asked to perform lead vocals on Steve Vai's album Sex & Religion. After recording and touring with Vai, Townsend was discouraged by what he found in the music industry, and vented his anger on the solo album Heavy as <b>a</b> <b>Really</b> Heavy Thing released under the pseudonym Strapping Young Lad. He soon assembled a band under the name, and released the critically acclaimed City in 1997. Since then, he has released three more studio albums with Strapping Young Lad, along with solo material released under his own independent record label, HevyDevy Records.|$|E
5|$|For the exterior, Burges re-used some of {{his earlier}} unexecuted plans, the overall design from the Crimea Memorial Church and St John's Cathedral, Brisbane, the {{elevations}} from Lille Cathedral. The main problem of the building was its size. Despite the prodigious efforts of its fundraisers, and despite Burges exceeding the original budget, Cork was still unable to afford <b>a</b> <b>really</b> large cathedral. Burges overcame this obstacle by using the grandeur of his three-spired exterior to offset the lesser scale of {{the remainder of the}} building.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jennifer Crittenden, and {{directed}} by Swinton O. Scott III. This was the first episode Scott directed for the show. Crittenden also made her debut as a writer for The Simpsons in this episode. Crittenden was taking a beginners' writing program at 20th Century Fox when former The Simpsons showrunner David Mirkin hired her on the show. Crittenden's only writing experience before that had been as an intern on the Late Show with David Letterman. 20th Century Fox introduced Crittenden to Mirkin, and Mirkin read a script of hers that he liked. When Mirkin first talked to Crittenden, {{he thought she was}} <b>a</b> <b>really</b> nice woman who was very mature. Crittenden was only 23 years old at the time, but Mirkin liked her and he hired her.|$|E

5|$|There {{was this}} {{absolute}} scorching deal on cases of PBR and kegs. We {{were one of}} the few outlets in Portland that sold kegs to go, so we could sell them at <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good deal. So we started the PBR dollar-can special. I'd say it was around 1997 or 1998. At one point, I know they said we were the largest distributor of Pabst in the state, if not the country. We got written up in The New York Times about it. We were going through hundreds of cases and dozens of kegs a week.|$|E
5|$|The band began {{production}} on Parachutes in late 1999, after producing & releasing The Blue Room EP with British record producer Chris Allison. Allison {{was asked to}} assist with production, and the band's musical direction, which was desired by both the band & the A department. Production started with the track 'High Speed', {{which was part of}} the EP and was later re-released as a part of Parachutes. Allison describes 'High Speed' as thus: 'You'll notice it is quite a bit different to the other tracks, because there are other sounds going on in it: we wanted to mix a soundscape in with the classic rock sound on that particular track. I thought 'High Speed' was <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good marriage between the classic rock sound and the new sound that was developing out of it, something that was more atmospheric'. Seven tracks in all were recorded during the sessions at Orinoco studios in London, with three of them ending up on The Blue Room EP.|$|E
5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in <b>a</b> <b>really</b> strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E

5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was {{and so it was}} <b>a</b> <b>really</b> nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E
