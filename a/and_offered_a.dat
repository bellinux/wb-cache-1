After three days of peaceful intermingling, on the night of 30 October the Dutch forces took over the fortress, appropriated all weapons, and captured Tiku.

5|$|In {{the same}} year Things Fall Apart was published, Achebe was {{promoted}} at the NBS and {{put in charge of}} the network's eastern region coverage. He moved to Enugu and began to work on his administrative duties. There he met a woman named Christiana Chinwe (Christie) Okoli, who had grown up in the area and joined the NBS staff when he arrived. They first conversed when she brought to his attention a pay discrepancy; a friend of hers found that, although they had been hired simultaneously, Christie had been rated lower <b>and</b> <b>offered</b> <b>a</b> lower wage. Sent to the hospital for an appendectomy soon after, she was pleasantly surprised when Achebe visited her with gifts and magazines.|$|E
5|$|Morrow also demanded {{consistency}} {{from local}} law enforcement officials. In 1921, he removed the Woodford County jailer from office because he allowed a black inmate to be lynched <b>and</b> <b>offered</b> <b>a</b> reward of $25,000 {{for information leading to}} the arrest and conviction of the perpetrators. Citizens of Versailles were more outraged that the jailer had been removed from office than that the prisoner had been lynched. The locals refused to aid in the investigation, and the lynchers were never arrested or charged. Local officials appointed the jailer's wife to finish his term in an attempt to skirt the removal.|$|E
5|$|Settlement {{continued}} {{to follow the}} river down the valley. At the confluence with Castle Creek, the valley widened <b>and</b> <b>offered</b> <b>a</b> flood plain conducive {{to the development of}} a town. The slopes of the surrounding mountains proved to have the silver deposits the prospectors had anticipated, and very soon the mining camp became a small city, named Aspen after the trees that filled the surrounding forests. It grew rapidly, becoming the seat of the newly created Pitkin County, named after the governor its earliest settlers had disobeyed by coming there.|$|E

5|$|Galileo made {{a number}} of {{contributions}} to what is now known as engineering, as distinct from pure physics. Between 1595 and 1598, Galileo devised and improved a Geometric and military compass suitable for use by gunners and surveyors. This expanded on earlier instruments designed by Niccolò Tartaglia and Guidobaldo del Monte. For gunners, it offered, in addition to a new and safer way of elevating cannons accurately, a way of quickly computing the charge of gunpowder for cannonballs of different sizes and materials. As a geometric instrument, it enabled the construction of any regular polygon, computation of the area of any polygon or circular sector, {{and a variety of other}} calculations. Under Galileo's direction, instrument maker Marc'Antonio Mazzoleni produced more than 100 of these compasses, which Galileo sold (along with an instruction manual he wrote) for 50 lire <b>and</b> <b>offered</b> <b>a</b> course of instruction in the use of the compasses for 120 lire.|$|E
5|$|In June 1832 Yagan led a {{party of}} Aborigines in attacking two labourers sowing a field of wheat {{alongside}} the Canning River near Kelmscott. One of the men, John Thomas, escaped, but the other, William Gaze, was wounded and later died as a result. The settlement declared Yagan an outlaw <b>and</b> <b>offered</b> <b>a</b> reward of £20 for his capture. He avoided capture until early October 1832. A group of fishermen enticed Yagan and two companions into their boat, then pushed off into deep water. The fishermen took the three Noongar men to the Perth guardhouse, from which they were transferred to the Round House at Fremantle. Yagan was sentenced to death, but he was saved by the intercession of settler Robert Lyon. Arguing that Yagan was defending his land against invasion, Lyon said Yagan {{should not be considered}} a criminal but a prisoner of war and suggested he should be treated as such. At the recommendation of John Septimus Roe, the Surveyor-General of Western Australia, Yagan and his men were exiled on Carnac Island under the supervision of Lyon and two soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Speedie {{was drafted}} by the National Football League's Detroit Lions in the late rounds of the 1942 draft. Fred Mandel, {{the owner of the}} Lions, visited him at Fort Warren <b>and</b> <b>offered</b> <b>a</b> {{contract}} worth $2,800 a year. Speedie wanted to sign immediately, but Mandel preferred to wait until after the war. By the time the war drew to a close in 1945, however, Speedie was considering signing with the Chicago Rockets, a team in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). He was pursued by the Rockets after playing well against a team at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro from which many of the Rockets' players were drawn. Speedie was also spotted by Paul Brown, who had been the head coach of a military team at Great Lakes Naval Station that played against the Broncos. Brown, who was starting a new AAFC team called the Cleveland Browns, sent a friend named Jackie Ranen to sign Speedie for $7,000 in 1946.|$|E
5|$|The Ramayana {{presents}} a similar account about Kamadhenu, however, here the sage is Vashista {{and the king}} is Vishwamitra. Once, king Vishwamitra with his army arrived at the hermitage of sage Vashista. The sage welcomed him <b>and</b> <b>offered</b> <b>a</b> huge banquet – to the army – that was produced by Sabala – as Kamadhenu is called in the text. The astonished king asked the sage to part with Sabala and instead offered thousand of ordinary cows, elephants, horses and jewels in return. However, the sage refused to part with Sabala, who was necessary {{for the performance of}} the sacred rituals and charity by the sage. Agitated, Vishwamitra seized Sabala by force, but she returned to her master, fighting the king's men. She hinted Vashista to order her to destroy the king's army and the sage followed her wish. Intensely, she produced Pahlava warriors, who were slain by Vishwamita's army. So she produced warriors of Shaka-Yavana lineage. From her mouth, emerged the Kambhojas, from her udder Barvaras, from her hind Yavanas and Shakas, and from pores on her skin, Haritas, Kiratas and other foreign warriors. Together, the army of Sabala killed Vishwamitra's army and all his sons. This event led to a great rivalry between Vashista and Vishwamitra, who renounced his kingdom and became a great sage to defeat Vashista.|$|E
