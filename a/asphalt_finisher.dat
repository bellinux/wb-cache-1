40|$|The allocation, {{scheduling}} and Productivity of heavy equipment {{on a road}} widening Project A. P. Pettarani MakassarAllocation, {{scheduling and}} equipment selection for each item of work {{is very important for}} the ability to optimize its operation and mutual support of other equipment. Given that heavy equipment is very expensive and quite dominant contributions on the Road Widening Project A. P. Pettarani Makassar, so it will need action by the efficiency of resource utilization of these tools. Thus, this study is intended to analyze the scheduling and allocation of heavy equipment. The observation was conducted by calculating the production capacity of each machine, in order to obtain the value of productivity and number of needs the necessary tools on projects reviewed. Then by using Line of Balance method, the allocation of heavy equipment can be plotted for each item of work in accordance with the needs of a more efficient tool, so its use can be controlled to be more effective. Based on the results of the study, the needs of dump truck as much as 7 umits, 1 unit of motor grader, 2 units of wheel loaders, 1 unit of tandem roller, 1 unit of vibrator roller, 1 unit of water tank truck, 1 unit of excavator, 1 unit of pneumatic tire roller, 1 unit of asphalt sprayer and 1 unit of <b>asphalt</b> <b>finisher...</b>|$|E
40|$|Two {{small scale}} 'pilot' test {{sections}} {{have been constructed}} in Sterrebeek on a private road without traffic to gain experience with the construction method. These construction works demonstrated that a 'regular' asphalt paver {{can be used for}} onsite PERS constructions. Then a full scale test track has been constructed on a road with regular traffic in Herzele. The result of the first small scale construction was an inhomogeneous test section as the mix hardened too quickly and the construction had to be done in five parts. Skid resistance was not fulfilling the minimum requirement. The amount of accelerator in the mix influences skid resistance significantly. The more accelerator, the more foaming, the less skid resistance. The result of the second small scale construction was a more homogeneous test section with a slightly improved skid resistance, using a mix with less accelerator. Unfortunately, local unevenness's of the surface were caused by infiltration of water during the construction. Both small scale test sections were monitored yielding the following results:" Initial skid resistance was found to be insufficient based on dynamic measurements. It has been improved by sanding the surface with porphyry 0 / 2. An amount of 200 g/m² yields sufficient skid resistance. The sandblasting technique may be used as a solution in case skid resistance problems rise on a trafficked road. Attempts to measure sound absorption on drill cores of laboratory samples indicate that possibly absorption is not affected by sanding but more tests are needed to confirm this. " Drill cores taken from the first test section demonstrate a good adhesion to the sub layer. The adhesion is apparently weakened by some repeated action. Settling of the underlayer by the forces exerted by heavy vehicles is the main suspect. " Test slabs made during the second site construction were tested in laboratory: o Measurements on thin and plane sections reveal an average air void content of 21. 4 % and a good coating of aggregates and rubber by polyurethane. o A permeability of 3. 2 seconds was measured, which is comparable to new two-layer porous asphalt. o Mechanical impedance measurements show an estimated dynamic Young modulus of 526 MPa, which is very high compared to the other tests on PERS that were performed (64 to 208 MPa). o Acoustical absorption was measured on three drill cores. The peak frequencies of were found to be 995, 970 and 980 Hz. The maximum absorption coefficients were found to be 0. 93, 0. 94 and 0. 95. These results are similar to Arnakke. " CPB measurements were performed on the second test sections with a Citroën C 1. A noise reductions of 7. 6 dB(A) at 50 km/h was measured with respect to an old dense asphalt concrete. This is surprisingly high if one keeps in mind the numerous unevenness's which caused tyre vibrations and extra noise. A small speed dependency was observed (more noise reduction at higher speeds). As CPX measurements could not be performed according to the standard and as the test section was too short, no reliable conclusions can be drawn from these measurements on both test sections. The full scale test section showed among others that:" An ordinary <b>asphalt</b> <b>finisher</b> can be used to get a surface with a nice texture and an acceptable evenness; although for the latter there is scope for improvement which is relatively easy to achieve by more practicing with the laying and the compacting" Porphyry 0 / 2 sand can be used to enhance the initial skid resistance, but it wears off after some time before the stone aggregates are exposed by wearing off of the polyurethane film. The skid resistance dropped during the first months without becoming dramatically low and then stabilized" The noise reduction is remarkable: and lies between 6 and 9 dB(A). " A CPB measurement with the same vehicle (Citroën C 1) as in Sterrebeek showed a similar noise reduction: 7. 9 dB(A). " CPX and SPB measurements showed no significant deterioration of the acoustic properties during the nine months the test track existed" Absorption appeared to be relatively low according to field test and quite high according to lab testing (considered the most reliable results). Mechanical impedance relatively high for a poroelastic pavement" Although about 2000 vehicles passed per day over the test track with about 5 % heavy vehicles, this test track showed a remarkable good raveling resistance during the 10 months of its existance. No glimpse of local or global raveling was observed as texture or colour change of the pavement. Neither were loose aggregate ever found in the gutter. " In the 8 th month of its lifetime some loosening was observed at the edge and in the 9 th also some in the first 10 m, apparently caused by settlings in the underlayer which did not resist to the direct exposure of the forces exerted by heavy vehicles. " The situation deteriorated quickly and the experiment had to be aborted in the 10 th month after the construction, i. e. June 2015...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a truck routing and scheduling problem faced {{by a public}} works company. Itconsists of optimizing the collection and delivery of materials between sites, using a heterogeneousfleet of vehicles. These flows of materials arise in levelling works and construction of roads networks. As the quantity of demands usually exceeds the capacity of a truck, several trucks are needed tofulfill them. As a result, demands are split into full truckloads. A set of trucks routes are needed toserve a set of demands sharing a set of resources, available at pickup or delivery sites, which can beloaders or <b>asphalt</b> <b>finishers</b> in our application cases. Thus, these routes need to be synchronized ateach resource. We propose an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) to solve this problem. This approach is evaluated on real instances from a public work company in France...|$|R
50|$|NZG {{specializes in}} a wide variety of heavy {{equipment}} types ranging from hand pallet movers, forklifts, scissors lifts, reach stackers, power generators and skidsteers to front loaders, shovels, excavators, graders, and mammoth ore carrying dump trucks. Caterpillar and other engines and machinery are sometimes also made and displayed free-standing. Some offerings, like pavement profilers, road <b>finishers,</b> <b>asphalt</b> strippers, road rollers, pipelayers, large cranes and drill rigs have also been offered, and NZG seems to have the market corner in promoting many models for a variety of manufacturers (Toy Fair 2011). Considering the variety of commercial model vehicles and equipment, one sees that details are intricate and sometimes delicate. To call NZG models 'toys' is too simple - they are precise replicas of the real thing - and quite sophisticated.|$|R
