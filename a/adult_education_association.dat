40|$|Sorry, {{the full}} text of this article is not {{available}} in Huskie Commons. Please click on the alternative location to access it. 217 p. Adult educators have been engaged in recent years in an ideological debate on the merits of professionalizing <b>adult</b> <b>education.</b> Although those in the occupation debate this issue, nowhere is the term "professionalism" clearly defined. The literature on this topic confirms the complexity of the term, and little empirical data exist to clarify the degree of actual disagreement in the ideological debate. Therefore, this study addresses three research questions: (a) What are adult educators' attitudes and ideological orientation toward professionalism? (b) What is the relationship between adult educators' ideological orientation and attitudes toward professionalism? (c) What is the relationship between adult educators' demographic characteristics and their ideological orientation?Data were collected on adult educators who belong to professional <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> <b>associations</b> by means of the <b>Adult</b> <b>Education</b> Profile (AEP). This instrument contains 38 items related to 19 professional dimensions found in the sociological literature. In order to assess adult educators' ideological orientation, three ideology groups were identified based on a three-item ideology scale. These groups were labeled traditional, moderate, and non-traditional according to their relative support of a traditional understanding of professionalism. The findings indicate widespread support among adult educators for 13 of the 19 professional dimensions. Attitudes related to public service receive the strongest support, while occupational self-regulation and dimensions closely associated with the traditional medical model receive the least support. A positive correlation between ideological viewpoint and attitudes toward professionalism is reported for all but two professional dimensions. For example, individuals with traditional ideology scores have higher scores on most professional dimensions. Demographic variables were found to have minimal relationships with adult educators' ideological orientation toward professionalism. The study provides the beginnings of an empirically-constructed definition of the professionalism of <b>adult</b> <b>education.</b> In addition, it reveals that many adult educators support professionalism but reject the traditional model of professionalism. A more inclusive, client-centered model of professionalism is suggested...|$|R

The seminar focused on different efforts to increase computer literacy as well as awareness {{of the role of}} computers and information technology in society and on human life, in particular by means of study circles given by <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> <b>associations.</b> From the perspective of these associations, the content of the circles, the recruitment of trainers and participants and the accessibility to computers was dealt with. The different initiatives to stimulate such study circles and stipulate their content and target groups from above, e. g. by the Swedish Council for Planning and Coordination of Research (Forskningsrådsnämnden) and the Swedish National Board of Education (Skolöverstyrelsen), were however treated in greater detail. Particular attention was given to the initiative “Broader Computer Education and Training” (Bred datautbilding) led by the Swedish Commission for Informatics Policy (Datadelegationen) starting in 1982. The “broadness” was supposedly twofold. Firstly, the education and training should reach many people. Secondly, it should have a broad content, mediating knowledge about computers, i. e. the technology, as well as its use and its consequences. The roots of and motives behind these initiatives were discussed at depth. Key ingredients in this respect was to counteract increasing gaps in knowledge levels on what was considered a future key technology, and the concerns and strategies of the different parties on the labor market in relation to new information technology...|$|R

40|$|Many adults attend {{and rely}} on {{continuing}} professional education (CPE) throughout their careers, and CPE is big business for associations. One way associations deliver CPE is through educational conferences. While <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> theories and frameworks offer developmental and operational guidance and advice, there is little practice data to understand what meeting planning professionals actually do as they implement <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> conferences in practice. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify the elements that practicing meeting planning professionals in associations utilize in CPE conference planning and which elements are considered the most important. This study accessed a senior group of association planners who held credentials offered by meeting planning industry associations. In all, 40 participants with a cumulative 784 years of experience participated in eight, online focus group discussions. Utilizing a constructivist orientation, the study employed grounded theory to identify 23 specific elements which were divided into three overarching categories: CPE-related, business-related, and venue. When compared with the cited theoretical models, six of these 23 elements were strongly supported, eight elements were supported, and nine elements were not supported. Only two elements in the cited literature did not appear in the research group-derived list. The three most important elements that emerged were goals and objectives, budget, and venue. A model to describe these findings is offered. This project studied actual practice to understand it better in light of the literature of <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> program planning models. The subject pool was very narrow and the results of this research cannot be generalized. The findings, while partially represented in the literature, fit no single previous model. The most important implications of this study may be to provide insight into <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> in CPE <b>association</b> conference application and suggest areas for future research...|$|R
