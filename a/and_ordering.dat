40|$|A {{significant}} {{topic in}} American political discourse {{is that of}} law <b>and</b> <b>order.</b> Politicians, civic leaders, and policy makers often propose a hard-line towards crime so that “law <b>and</b> <b>order</b> ” is maintained. In this essay, I contend that the discourse of “law <b>and</b> <b>order</b> ” has taken on mythic properties in American political discourse, and that the media, in large part, {{has contributed to the}} creation of a “law <b>and</b> <b>order</b> ” myth. The “law <b>and</b> <b>order</b> ” rhetoric of J. Edgar Hoover, Estes Kaufaver, George C. Wallace, and Richard Nixon all have been greatly aided by a media presence that extends the topic of “law <b>and</b> <b>order</b> ” beyond the realm of political discourse and into the realm of political myth. This essay discusses the influence of Hoover, Kefauver’s, Wallace’s, and Nixon’s “law <b>and</b> <b>order</b> ” rhetoric, <b>and</b> points out the media coverage, in each of these cases, aided in creating a powerful cultural and political “law <b>and</b> <b>order</b> ” myth...|$|R

Marsh finds an undamaged meteorite is shaped like a small stone rocket. It then cracks open, releasing a gas, leaving him with an odd V-shaped mark on his face. Black-clad guards from the complex arrive, armed with machine guns and sporting similar V-shaped marks, and take Marsh away, knocking down Quatermass <b>and</b> <b>ordering</b> him to leave.|$|E

The president favoured his own Toubou ethnic group and discriminated against his former allies, the Zaghawa. His general, Idriss Déby, overthrew him in 1990. Attempts to prosecute Habré led to his placement under house arrest in Senegal in 2005; in 2013, Habré was formally charged with war crimes committed during his rule.

5|$|After Sercey {{returned}} to Île de France his squadron broke up. Four ships were {{sent back to}} France in 1797 and 1798 as Île de France could no longer supply repairs, manpower or provisions in support of Sercey. This dispersal of the squadron was encouraged by the Colonial Assembly of Île de France and Governor Malartic neither of whom were well-disposed to the Directory then ruling France. With his remaining crews becoming rebellious, Sercey sent Forte and Prudente on a commerce raiding operation during the autumn of 1798, during which they achieved some success in the Bay of Bengal. By the time this force {{returned to}} Île de France Sercey had sailed to Batavia, leaving instructions for Forte and Prudente to follow him. Malartic countermanded this order, seizing Prudente and selling the frigate to a privateer concern <b>and</b> <b>ordering</b> Forte to operate independently in the Bay of Bengal {{in the autumn of}} 1798.

5|$|Although the Argentine and Chilean navies possessed {{insignificant}} {{naval forces}} in the 1860s, with zero and five warships, respectively, Argentina's concern over a strong Brazilian Navy and the Chilean war against Spain caused them to add capable warships to their fleets in the 1870s. During this time, diplomatic relations between Argentina and Chile soured due to conflicting boundary claims, particularly in Patagonia. By {{the beginning of the}} 1880s, after the War of the Pacific, the Chilean government possessed possibly the strongest navy in the Americas. They planned to add to it with an 1887 appropriation for one battleship, two protected cruisers, and two torpedo gunboats. Argentina responded a year later with an order for two battleships of its own. The naval arms race unfolded over the next several years, with each country buying <b>and</b> <b>ordering</b> vessels that were slightly better than the previous ship, but the Argentines eventually pulled ahead with the acquisition of multiple Garibaldi-class cruisers.|$|E
