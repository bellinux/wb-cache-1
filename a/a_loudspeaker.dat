5|$|In the morning, {{attention}} focused on the capital Saigon, where approximately 500 Buddhist laypeople, mostly youths, protested {{in front of the}} Government Delegate's office while 300 troops stood by. The crowd and a government official equipped with <b>a</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> exchanged taunts and accusations. When the official claimed that Vietcong were among the crowd and attempting to cause trouble, the troops aimed their firearms at the protestors.|$|E
5|$|A {{long line}} of subwoofers placed {{horizontally}} along {{the front edge of}} the stage can be delayed such that the center subs fire several milliseconds prior to the ones flanking them, which fire several milliseconds prior to their neighbors, continuing in this fashion until the last subwoofers are reached at the outside ends of the subwoofer row (beamforming). This method helps to counteract the extreme narrowing of horizontal dispersion pattern seen with a horizontal subwoofer array. Such delay shading can be used to virtually reshape <b>a</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> array.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>loudspeaker's</b> flyback {{current is}} not only {{dissipated}} through the amplifier output circuit, but also through the internal resistance of the loudspeaker itself. Therefore the choice of different loudspeakers will lead to different damping factors when coupled with the same amplifier.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> {{parabolic}} <b>loudspeaker</b> {{can send}} sound farther than traditional loudspeaker designs. The focused waves of <b>a</b> parabolic <b>loudspeaker</b> tend to dissipate in air at about 3 dB SPL per doubling of distance, {{rather than the}} usual 6 dB of conventional loudspeakers.|$|R
5|$|Guardian {{operates}} {{with five}} trains, each containing two cars that were manufactured by Art Engineering. Each car seats four riders back-to-back in seated rows; each train can seat eight riders. Every seat has a lap-bar restraint, a light gun, and <b>a</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> that provides sound during the ride. This configuration allows {{the ride to}} theoretically carry 650 riders per hour. The cars can rotate 90 degrees in both directions. The trains' light guns are programmed to display a unique colour on the ride's screens to indicate where each rider is shooting and to distinguish between shooters.|$|E
5|$|Subwoofers {{are made}} up of one or more woofers mounted in <b>a</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> enclosure—often made of wood—capable of {{withstanding}} air pressure while resisting deformation. Subwoofer enclosures {{come in a variety of}} designs, including bass reflex (with a port or vent), using a subwoofer and one or more passive radiator speakers in the enclosure, acoustic suspension (sealed enclosure), infinite baffle, horn-loaded, and bandpass designs, representing unique trade-offs with respect to efficiency, low frequency range, cabinet size and cost. Passive subwoofers have a subwoofer driver and enclosure and they are powered by an external amplifier. Active subwoofers include a built-in amplifier.|$|E
5|$|Sudirman's {{time as a}} PETA {{commander}} passed uneventfully until 21April 1945, when PETA troops {{under the}} command of Kusaeri began to rebel against the Japanese. Ordered to stop the rebellion, Sudirman agreed to do so only if the PETA rebels would not be harmed, and places harbouring them not razed; this condition was accepted by the Japanese commander, and Sudirman and his troops began searching for the rebels. Although Kusaeri's men initially shot at the commander, after Sudirman used <b>a</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> to tell them they would not be harmed, they backed down. Kusaeri surrendered on 25 April. This garnered support for Sudirman within the occupation forces, although several high-ranking Japanese officers expressed concern over Sudirman's support for Indonesian independence. Sudirman and his men were soon sent to a camp in Bogor, ostensibly for training; however, they were tasked with hard labour as a way to prevent a further uprising, and rumours circulated that the PETA officers would be killed.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> {{bookshelf}} <b>loudspeaker</b> (or bookshelf speaker) is <b>a</b> compact <b>loudspeaker,</b> generally {{sold for}} consumer-grade home audio applications {{as part of}} a shelf stereo pair or home theater package, that is compact in size and intended to be placed on a raised surface, e.g. a bookshelf.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> magnetostatic <b>loudspeaker</b> is <b>a</b> dipole <b>loudspeaker</b> that {{is similar}} to <b>an</b> {{electrostatic}} <b>loudspeaker</b> but instead of using high voltages, uses high currents. Permanent magnets provide a static magnetic field. Wires or strips carrying audio frequency currents are bonded to a thin diaphragm. The current flowing in the conductors interacts with the magnetic field and creates sound {{in much the same way}} as in a conventional dynamic driver. Because of its dipole structure, this kind of speaker creates sound mostly to its front and back.|$|R

5|$|Bruce Robert Jackson (3 June 1949 – 29 January 2011) was an Australian audio {{engineer}} who co-founded JANDS, an Australian audio, lighting and staging company. He joined American touring audio engineer Roy Clair and mixed concert stage monitors for Elvis Presley in the 1970s. With Clair Brothers, a concert sound company, Jackson designed audio electronics including a custom mixing console. Beginning in 1978, Jackson toured as Bruce Springsteen's band engineer for a decade, using Clair Brothers sound systems. A business interest in Fairlight CMI in Sydney introduced Jackson to digital audio, and he subsequently founded the digital audio company Apogee Electronics in Santa Monica, California, {{where he lived}} at the time. After selling his share of Apogee, Jackson co-founded with Roy and Gene Clair a joint venture which produced the Clair iO, <b>a</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> management system for control of complex concert sound systems. Jackson turned the venture commercial {{with the help of}} Dave McGrath's Lake Technology. Dolby Laboratories bought the technology and formed Dolby Lake with Jackson as vice president, then in 2009 Lab.gruppen acquired the brand. Jackson was honoured with the Parnelli Innovator Award in 2005 for his inventive loudspeaker controller.|$|E
5|$|Realizing {{that they}} need one big show to raise the {{necessary}} money, the brothers persuade their old agent to book the Palace Hotel Ballroom, north of Chicago. They mount <b>a</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> atop the Bluesmobile and drive the Chicago area promoting the concert—and alerting the police, the Nazis, and the Good Ol' Boys of their whereabouts. The ballroom is packed with blues fans, police officers, and the Good Ol' Boys. Jake and Elwood perform two songs, then sneak offstage, as the tax deadline is rapidly approaching. A record company executive offers them a $10,000 cash advance on a recording contract—more than enough {{to pay off the}} orphanage's taxes and Ray's IOU—and then shows the brothers how to slip out of the building unnoticed. As they make their escape via a service tunnel, they are confronted by the mystery woman: Jake's vengeful ex-fiancée. After her volley of M16 rifle bullets leaves them miraculously unharmed, Jake offers a series of ridiculous excuses that she accepts, allowing the brothers to escape to the Bluesmobile.|$|E

25|$|A {{mid-range}} {{speaker is}} <b>a</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> driver that reproduces {{a band of}} frequencies generally between 1–6kHz, otherwise known as the 'mid' frequencies (between the woofer and tweeter). Mid-range driver diaphragms can be made of paper or composite materials, and can be direct radiation drivers (rather like smaller woofers) or they can be compression drivers (rather like some tweeter designs). If the mid-range driver is a direct radiator, it can be mounted on the front baffle of <b>a</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> enclosure, or, if a compression driver, mounted at the {{throat of a horn}} for added output level and control of radiation pattern.|$|E
25|$|A coaxial {{driver is}} <b>a</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> driver {{with two or}} several {{combined}} concentric drivers. Coaxial drivers have been produced by many companies, such as Altec, Tannoy, Pioneer, KEF, SEAS, B Speakers, BMS, Cabasse and Genelec.|$|E

25|$|The first {{amplifier}} stage is a preamplifier. It amplifies the audio signal {{to a level}} that can drive the power stage. The preamplifier also changes {{the tone of the}} signal; high preamp settings add overdrive.

25|$|Sensitivity– The sound {{pressure}} level produced by <b>a</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> in a non-reverberant environment, often specified in dB and measured at 1 meter with an input of 1 watt (2.83 rms volts into 8Ω), typically at one or more specified frequencies. Manufacturers often use this rating in marketing material.|$|E
25|$|The {{interaction}} of <b>a</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> system with its environment {{is complex and}} is largely out of the loudspeaker designer's control. Most listening rooms present {{a more or less}} reflective environment, depending on size, shape, volume, and furnishings. This means the sound reaching a listener's ears consists not only of sound directly from the speaker system, but also the same sound delayed by traveling to and from (and being modified by) one or more surfaces. These reflected sound waves, when added to the direct sound, cause cancellation and addition at assorted frequencies (e.g., from resonant room modes), thus changing the timbre and character of the sound at the listener's ears. The human brain is very sensitive to small variations, including some of these, and {{this is part of the}} reason why <b>a</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> system sounds different at different listening positions or in different rooms.|$|E
25|$|The Leslie speaker, most {{commonly}} associated with and predominantly used with the famous Hammond organ, {{takes advantage of the}} Doppler effect by using an electric motor to rotate an acoustic horn around <b>a</b> <b>loudspeaker,</b> sending its sound in a circle.
