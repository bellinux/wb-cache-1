5|$|Before {{departure}} for the <b>Antarctic</b> in August 1907, Joyce and Wild took {{a crash course}} in printing methods, as it was Shackleton's intention to publish a book or magazine while in the <b>Antarctic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nineteen {{men died}} on <b>Antarctic</b> expeditions during the Heroic Age. Of these, four died of {{illnesses}} unrelated to their <b>Antarctic</b> experiences, and two died from accidents in New Zealand. The remaining 13 perished during service {{on or near}} the <b>Antarctic</b> continent.|$|E
5|$|The Shackleton–Rowett Expedition (1921–22) was Sir Ernest Shackleton's last <b>Antarctic</b> project, and {{the final}} episode in the Heroic Age of <b>Antarctic</b> Exploration.|$|E
5|$|Adams's {{descriptions}} of wild rabbit behaviour {{were based on}} The Private Life of the Rabbit (1964), by British naturalist Ronald Lockley. The two later became friends, embarking on an <b>Antarctic</b> tour that {{became the subject of}} a co-authored book, Voyage Through the <b>Antarctic</b> (A. Lane, 1982).|$|E
5|$|After 1897, {{the search}} for dinosaur fossils {{extended}} to every continent, including Antarctica. The first <b>Antarctic</b> dinosaur to be discovered, the ankylosaurid Antarctopelta oliveroi, was found on James Ross Island in 1986, although it was 1994 before an <b>Antarctic</b> species, the theropod Cryolophosaurus ellioti, was formally named and described in a scientific journal.|$|E
5|$|Another study {{analysed}} {{the tissues}} of Adamussium colbecki and compared them {{with those of}} Pecten jacobaeus, a temperate water species of scallop. It was found that copper, iron, cadmium and chromium were concentrated in the digestive organ of the <b>Antarctic</b> scallop. Cadmium levels in particular {{were higher in the}} <b>Antarctic</b> scallop than in P. jacobaeus and other pectinids, but zinc and manganese, found in the kidney, were considerably lower.|$|E
5|$|<b>Antarctic</b> {{fisheries}} in 1998–99 (1 July– 30 June) reported landing 119,898 tonnes legally.|$|E
5|$|Antarctica is a {{de facto}} condominium, governed by parties to the <b>Antarctic</b> Treaty System that have {{consulting}} status. Twelve countries signed the <b>Antarctic</b> Treaty in 1959, and thirty-eight have signed it since then. The treaty prohibits military activities and mineral mining, prohibits nuclear explosions and nuclear waste disposal, supports scientific research, and protects the continent's ecozone. Ongoing experiments are conducted by more than 4,000 scientists from many nations.|$|E
5|$|Antarctica is {{intensely}} {{cold and}} arid. Most of the world's freshwater ice is contained within its sheets. Its most dramatic example of glacier retreat {{is the loss}} of large sections of the Larsen Ice Shelf on the <b>Antarctic</b> Peninsula. The recent collapse of Wordie Ice Shelf, Prince Gustav Ice Shelf, Mueller Ice Shelf, Jones Ice Shelf, Larsen-A and Larsen-B Ice Shelf on the <b>Antarctic</b> Peninsula has raised awareness of how dynamic ice shelf systems are.|$|E
5|$|Between 1839 and 1843 Royal Naval Captain James Clark Ross, {{commanding}} his {{two ships}} HMS Erebus and HMS Terror, completed three voyages to the <b>Antarctic</b> continent. During {{this time he}} discovered and explored a new sector of the <b>Antarctic</b> that would provide the field of work for many later British expeditions.|$|E
5|$|Born in Oslo in 1864 to a Norwegian {{father and}} an English mother, Carsten Borchgrevink emigrated to Australia in 1888, {{where he worked}} on survey teams in the {{interior}} before accepting a provincial schoolteaching appointment in New South Wales. In 1894 he joined a commercial expedition, led by Henryk Bull in the whaler <b>Antarctic,</b> which penetrated <b>Antarctic</b> waters and reached Cape Adare, the western portal to the Ross Sea. A party including Bull and Borchgrevink briefly landed there and {{claimed to be the}} first men to set foot on the <b>Antarctic</b> continent—although the American sealer John Davis believed he had landed on the <b>Antarctic</b> Peninsula in 1821. They also visited Possession Island in the Ross Sea, leaving a message in a tin box as proof of their journey. Borchgrevink was convinced that the Cape Adare location, with its huge penguin rookery providing a ready supply of fresh food and blubber, could serve as a base at which a future expedition could overwinter and subsequently explore the <b>Antarctic</b> interior.|$|E
5|$|Douglas Mawson had {{accompanied}} Ernest Shackleton's 1907–09 British <b>Antarctic</b> Expedition. Along with Edgeworth David and Alistair Mackay, {{he had been}} part of a man-hauled sledging expedition, the first to reach the area of the South Magnetic Pole. Upon his return from Antarctica, he recommenced to his post as geology lecturer at the University of Adelaide. Despite an offer from Robert Falcon Scott to join his Terra Nova Expedition to reach the Geographic South Pole, Mawson began planning his own <b>Antarctic</b> expedition. Mawson's plan, which led to the Australasian <b>Antarctic</b> Expedition, envisaged three bases on the <b>Antarctic</b> continent, collectively surveying much of the coast directly south of Australia. He approached Shackleton, who not only approved of his plan but was prepared to lead the expedition himself. Although Shackleton withdrew from the expedition in December 1910, he continued to assist Mawson with publicity and fund-raising.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>Antarctic</b> {{winter of}} 1902 Discovery became {{locked in the}} ice. Efforts to free her {{during the summer of}} 1902–03 failed, and {{although}} some of the expedition's members (including Ernest Shackleton) left in a relief ship, Crean and the majority of the party remained in the <b>Antarctic</b> until the ship was finally freed in February 1904. After returning to regular naval duty, Crean was promoted to petty officer, first class, on Scott's recommendation.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there is}} some {{evidence}} of <b>antarctic</b> marine glaciation during the Cretaceous period.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>Antarctic,</b> {{species were}} found in the South Shetland Islands, South Orkney Islands, South Georgia and the <b>Antarctic</b> Peninsula. Species from the <b>Antarctic</b> or subantarctic regions are rarer than {{specimens}} in the Arctic regions, although lack of access may be a factor. Until 1983, only five records were made, with only individual finds since then. According to two studies of the myxomycete flora of these regions, more species were discovered in the subantarctic forests, for example 67 species in Argentinian Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, and 22 on high ground on Macquarie Island.|$|E
5|$|Joyce {{came from}} a humble {{seafaring}} background and began his naval career as a boy seaman in 1891. His <b>Antarctic</b> experiences began 10 years later, when he joined Scott's Discovery Expedition as an Able Seaman. In 1907 Shackleton recruited Joyce {{to take charge of}} dogs and sledges on the Nimrod Expedition. Subsequently Joyce was engaged in a similar capacity for Douglas Mawson's Australasian <b>Antarctic</b> Expedition in 1911, but left the expedition before it departed for the <b>Antarctic.</b> In 1914 Shackleton recruited Joyce for the Ross Sea party; despite his heroics this expedition marked the end of Joyce's association with the <b>Antarctic,</b> and of his exploring career, although he made repeated attempts to join other expeditions.|$|E
5|$|Mackintosh's first <b>Antarctic</b> {{experience}} was as second officer on Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition, 1907–09. Shortly {{after his arrival}} in the <b>Antarctic,</b> a shipboard accident destroyed his right eye, and he {{was sent back to}} New Zealand. He returned in 1909 to participate in the later stages of the expedition; his will and determination in adversity impressed Shackleton, and led to his Ross Sea party appointment in 1914.|$|E
5|$|None of {{the other}} Endurance {{veterans}} returned to the <b>Antarctic,</b> although Worsley made one voyage to the Arctic in 1925. Of the other crew and staff of Quest, the Australian naturalist Hubert Wilkins became a pioneer aviator in both the Arctic and <b>Antarctic,</b> in 1928 flying from Point Barrow, Alaska to Spitsbergen. He also made several unsuccessful attempts during the 1930s, {{in collaboration with the}} American adventurer Lincoln Ellsworth, to fly to the South Pole. James Marr, the Boy Scout, also became an <b>Antarctic</b> regular after qualifying as a marine biologist, joining several Australian expeditions in the late 1920s and 1930s. Roderick Carr, the frustrated pilot, became an Air Marshal in the Royal Air Force and Deputy Chief of Staff (Air) to SHAEF in 1945.|$|E
5|$|On {{its return}} to England the {{expedition}} was coolly received by London's geographical establishment which was resentful of the pre-emption {{of a role}} they envisaged for their own National <b>Antarctic</b> (Discovery) Expedition. There were also questions about Borchgrevink's leadership qualities, and criticism of the limited amounts of scientific information which the expedition provided. Despite the groundbreaking achievements in <b>Antarctic</b> survival and travel, Borchgrevink was never accorded the heroic status of Scott or Shackleton, and his expedition was soon forgotten in the dramas which surrounded these and other Heroic Age explorers. However, Roald Amundsen, conqueror of the South Pole in 1911, acknowledged that Borchgrevink's expedition had removed the greatest obstacles to <b>Antarctic</b> travel, and had {{opened the way for}} all the expeditions that followed.|$|E
5|$|Sanaa Lathan as Alexa Woods, an {{experienced}} guide who spent several seasons exploring the Arctic and <b>Antarctic</b> environments.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton {{returned}} from the <b>Antarctic</b> having narrowly failed to reach the Pole, and this gave Scott the impetus to proceed with plans for his second <b>Antarctic</b> expedition. On 24 March 1909, {{he had taken the}} Admiralty-based appointment of naval assistant to the Second Sea Lord which placed him conveniently in London. In December he was released on half-pay, to take up the full-time command of the British <b>Antarctic</b> Expedition 1910, {{to be known as the}} Terra Nova Expedition from its ship, Terra Nova.|$|E
5|$|Smith was a {{pilot for}} the Byrd <b>Antarctic</b> Expedition of 1928–1930 {{involved}} in aerial overflights to discover new land {{that could be}} claimed {{for the benefit of}} the United States. The land was later viewed by Byrd and named after his wife. Smith was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Congressional Gold Medal. An <b>Antarctic</b> peak bears his name. He was inducted into the New Jersey Aviation Hall of Fame in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Southern Cross left London on 23 August 1898, after {{inspection}} by HRH the Duke of York (the future King George V), {{who presented}} a Union Flag. Along with the expedition's personnel, equipment and provisions {{the ship was}} carrying Siberian sledge dogs, {{the first to be}} taken on an <b>Antarctic</b> expedition. After final provisioning in Hobart, Tasmania, Southern Cross sailed for the <b>Antarctic</b> on 19 December. She crossed the <b>Antarctic</b> Circle on 23 January 1899, and was then caught in the pack ice for three weeks. Cape Adare was sighted on 16 February, and the following day the ship was anchored close to the shore.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Antarctic</b> scallop is {{monitored}} {{in connection with}} the Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VME) classification set up by the Convention on the Conservation of <b>Antarctic</b> Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). As such, notification is required to be made by vessels that land the scallop as by-catch during their fishing activities.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Antarctic</b> sheet {{is divided}} by the Transantarctic Mountains into two unequal {{sections}} known as the East <b>Antarctic</b> ice sheet (EAIS) and the smaller West <b>Antarctic</b> Ice Sheet (WAIS). The EAIS rests on a major land mass but {{the bed of the}} WAIS is, in places, more than 2,500 metres below sea level. It would be seabed if the ice sheet were not there. The WAIS is classified as a marine-based ice sheet, meaning that its bed lies below sea level and its edges flow into floating ice shelves. The WAIS is bounded by the Ross Ice Shelf, the Ronne Ice Shelf, and outlet glaciers that drain into the Amundsen Sea.|$|E
5|$|The Berry Bastion, an <b>Antarctic</b> mountain, {{was named}} in his honor.|$|E
5|$|The British National <b>Antarctic</b> Expedition, 1901–04, {{generally}} {{known as}} the Discovery Expedition, was the first official British exploration of the <b>Antarctic</b> regions since James Clark Ross's voyage sixty years earlier. Organized {{on a large scale}} under a joint committee of the Royal Society and the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), the new expedition carried out scientific research and geographical exploration in what was then largely an untouched continent. It launched the <b>Antarctic</b> careers of many who would become leading figures in the Heroic Age of <b>Antarctic</b> Exploration, including Robert Falcon Scott who led the expedition, Ernest Shackleton, Edward Wilson, Frank Wild, Tom Crean and William Lashly.|$|E
5|$|The Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers {{are two of}} Antarctica's five largest ice streams. Scientists {{have found}} that the flow of these ice streams has {{accelerated}} in recent years, and suggested that if they were to melt, global sea levels would rise by , destabilising the entire West <b>Antarctic</b> Ice Sheet and perhaps sections of the East <b>Antarctic</b> Ice Sheet.|$|E
5|$|The {{first flight}} by an RAAF C-17 to Antarctica was {{conducted}} in November 2015. The aircraft transported supplies for the Australian <b>Antarctic</b> Division from Hobart to Wilkins Runway, and its crew practised evacuating casualties from Wilkins after the cargo was unloaded. This flight {{was reported to have}} been the first time the RAAF had flown missions to the Australian <b>Antarctic</b> Territory since the <b>Antarctic</b> Flight was withdrawn in 1963. Further flights occurred in early 2016. A trial winter airdrop was also conducted at Casey Station in June that year. In September 2017 air-to-air refuelling was used to enable a Globemaster to drop supplies at Davis Station.|$|E
5|$|The {{lack of a}} {{permanent}} population would seem to prevent the British overseas territories of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands and British <b>Antarctic</b> Territory, the New Zealand territory of Ross Dependency and the Australian external territories of Australian <b>Antarctic</b> Territory, Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Coral Sea Islands and Heard Island and McDonald Islands from competing.|$|E
5|$|The last Bulgarian monarch, Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, {{was named}} after Simeon I. A brand of {{high-quality}} grape rakija, Car Simeon Veliki, also bears his name, and an <b>Antarctic</b> peak on Livingston Island of the South Shetland Islands was named Simeon Peak in his honour by the <b>Antarctic</b> Place-names Commission.|$|E
5|$|The oceanographic {{research}} voyage {{known as the}} Challenger Expedition, 1872–76, explored <b>Antarctic</b> waters for several weeks, but did not approach the land itself; its research, however, proved {{the existence of an}} <b>Antarctic</b> continent beyond reasonable doubt.|$|E
5|$|The {{passing of}} the <b>Antarctic</b> Conservation Act (1978) in the U.S. brought several {{restrictions}} to U.S. activity on Antarctica. The introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty, as can the extraction of any indigenous species. The overfishing of krill, which plays {{a large role in}} the <b>Antarctic</b> ecosystem, led officials to enact regulations on fishing. The Convention for the Conservation of <b>Antarctic</b> Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), a treaty that came into force in 1980, requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire <b>Antarctic</b> ecosystem. Despite these new acts, unregulated and illegal fishing, particularly of Patagonian toothfish (marketed as Chilean Sea Bass in the U.S.), remains a serious problem. The illegal fishing of toothfish has been increasing, with estimates of 32,000tonnes (35,300short tons) in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The ship's company, under Captain Bernard Jensen, {{consisted}} of 19Norwegian seamen and one Swedish steward. Jensen was an experienced ice navigator in Arctic and <b>Antarctic</b> waters, {{and had been}} with Borchgrevink on Bull's <b>Antarctic</b> voyage in 1894–95.|$|E
5|$|The table {{does not}} include the {{numerous}} whaling voyages that took place during this period, or sub-Antarctic expeditions such as that of Carl Chun in 1898–99, which did not penetrate the <b>Antarctic</b> circle. The abortive Cope Expedition of 1920–22, which collapsed through lack of funding, is likewise excluded, though two men were landed from a Norwegian whaler and spent a year on the <b>Antarctic</b> peninsula.|$|E
5|$|West Antarctica {{is covered}} by the West <b>Antarctic</b> Ice Sheet. The sheet has been of recent concern because of the real, if small, {{possibility}} of its collapse. If the sheet were to break down, ocean levels would rise by several metres in a relatively geologically short period of time, perhaps a matter of centuries. Several <b>Antarctic</b> ice streams, which account for about 10% of the ice sheet, flow {{to one of the}} many <b>Antarctic</b> ice shelves: see ice-sheet dynamics.|$|E
