It is characterized by slowly enlarging, painless, indurate nodules or plaques and often misdiagnosed as benign skin tumours. Although these tumours show characteristic tubular structures mixed with cellular cords and have some pattern of cytokeratins, primary apocrine carcinoma is indistinguishable from metastatic mammary ductal carcinomas. Like other apocrine carcinomas it is radioresistant and therefore surgical resection is the method of choice in treatment of patients. Distant metastases {{have been reported in}} a limited number of published cases. AimWe present the case of a 66 -year-old woman with apocrine adenocarcinoma of the left <b>axillary</b> <b>area</b> with local lymph node and distant metastases.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and the prognostic value of gamma-probe-directed lymphatic mapping in cutaneous melanomas. METHODS: Sixty-five stage I and II melanoma patients underwent gamma-probe-directed lymphatic mapping. Sentinel lymph nodes were studied by both conventional and immunohistochemical stainings. The median follow-up was 11 months. RESULTS: Sensitivities of preoperative and intraoperative sentinel lymph node detection were 100 and 98 %, respectively.

40|$|Introduction. A {{bleeding}} syndrome in {{the setting}} of primary hyperfibrinolysis in a prostate cancer patient is only 0. 40 – 1. 65 % of cases. The laboratory diagnosis of primary hyperfibrinolysis is based on the increase of biomarkers like D-dimer, fibrinogen split products, plasminogen, and euglobulin lysis test. These tests are not specific for primary hyperfibrinolysis. We reported a rare case of hemorrhagic syndrome caused by primary hyperfibrinolysis as the first clinical symptom of metastatic prostate cancer. Case report. A 64 -year-old male was admitted to our hospital with large hematomas in the right pectoral and <b>axillary</b> <b>areas</b> (20 x 7 cm), right hemiabdomen (30 x 30 cm) and the left lumbal area, (25 x 5 cm). The patient had no subjective symptoms nor used any medication. Initial coagulation testing, prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were within the normal range, while fibrinogen level was extremely low (1. 068 g/L) (normal range 2. 0 – 5. 0) and the D-dimer assay result was high 1. 122 mg/L (normal range < 0. 23). The results obtained by rotation thrombelastometry pointed to primary fibrinolysis. Further clinical and laboratory examination indicated progressive malignant prostate disease. First line treatment for the patient was a combined administration of tranexamic acid (3 x 500 mg iv) and transfusion of ten units of cryoprecipitate (400 mL). Next day, fibrinolytic function measurements by rotation thrombelastometry were within the normal ranges. Fibrinogen level was normalized within two days (2. 4 g/L). There were no newly developed hematomas. Conclusion. This case report shows primary hyperfibrinolysis with bleeding symptoms, which is an uncommon paraneoplastic phenomenon within expanded prostate malignancy. Rotation thrombelastometry in this severe complication helped to achieve the prompt and proper diagnosis and treatment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Lymph nodes are {{assessed}} routinely in clinical practice and their size is followed throughout radiation or chemotherapy {{to monitor the}} effectiveness of cancer treatment. This paper presents a robust learning-based method for automatic detection and segmentation of solid lymph nodes from CT data, with the following contributions. First, it presents a learning based approach to solid lymph node detection that relies on Marginal Space Learning to achieve great speedup with virtually no loss in accuracy. Second, it presents a computationally efficient segmentation method for solid lymph nodes (LN). Third, it introduces two new sets of features that are effective for LN detection, one that self-aligns to high gradients and another set obtained from the segmentation result. The method is evaluated for axillary LN detection on 131 volumes containing 371 LN, yielding a 83. 0 % detection rate with 1. 0 false positive per volume. It is further evaluated for pelvic and abdominal LN detection on 54 volumes containing 569 LN, yielding a 80. 0 % detection rate with 3. 2 false positives per volume. The running time is 5 - 20 seconds per volume for <b>axillary</b> <b>areas</b> and 15 - 40 seconds for pelvic. An added benefit of the method is the capability to detect and segment conglomerated lymph nodes. According to the well-established RECIST guidelines [15] that are widely applied in clinical routine, lesions {{are considered to be}} measurable if they have a diameter of at least 10 mm in CT. Only those measurable lesions will be considered as so-called target lesions to be recorded and tracked over time across follow-up exams during therapies. Following these guidelines, our method is targeted for detecting clinically relevant (and possibly malignant) lymph nodes of size at least 10 mm. Similar requirements are confirmed in [4] for neck lymph nodes. Index Terms—lymph node detection, lymph node segmentation, cancer staging. I...|$|R

Cutaneous {{basal cell carcinoma}} (BCC) is a common malignancy amongst the elderly. BCC rarely metastasises, and fewer than 300 cases ofmetastatic BCC {{have been reported in}} the literature. Here, we report a case of sequentially developed BCCs located adjacent to each other. We discuss that these BCCs were considered to have developed independently rather than due to metastasis, after referencing previous studies on metastatic BCC. 1. Case Report An 80 -year-old woman presented at our department with two tumours in the right <b>axillary</b> <b>area.</b> A medical interview revealed that the tumour located on the axillae appeared first. The patient reported that the tumour was sometimes accompanied by excoriation and serous discharge. Four years after the appearance of the first tumour, the second one developed on the right side of the chest and contacted the first tumour when the right shoulder joint was adducted (Figure...|$|E
40|$|Lymphangioma {{is a type}} of {{developmental}} abnormality of the lymphoid system that occurs at the site of lymphatic-venous connections. In most cases, lymphangiomas are located in the posterior neck and head as cystic hygroma colli, which are frequently associated with chromosomal abnormalities and various malformation syndromes. Lymphangiomas at locations other than the posterior neck and head are rarely seen. We report the prenatal diagnosis of two cases of intrauterine axillary lymphangiomas and one case of an intraabdominal lymphangioma. The sonographic appearance of these lymphangiomas was a thin-walled, multilocular cyst located in the <b>axillary</b> <b>area</b> or the pelvis. The karyotypes of these babies were normal. One of the babies did well after surgery; one had neurologic sequelae, and one later developed a lymphangioma in the skull. The prognoses of these babies seemed to be better than those with cervical lymphangiomas. However, we are unable to draw any definite conclusions because of the limited number of cases. More investigations should be conducted in the future...|$|E
40|$|The Newton bra marries {{strength}} and stability with an attractive design in providing the ultimate movement reduction for large cup women participating in high impact sports. Using a qualitative survey of 17 participants, the research aimed {{to identify the}} features most desired in a sports bra for women 40 - 60 who wear a C-cup or larger. The most important attribute was to reduce or eliminate movement. Following a user-centered design framework, the Newton Bra incorporates an elastic band constructed to diminish the upward movement of the breast tissue. The bra design employs a 2 -layer system of encapsulation with an additional outer layer of compression which includes the <b>axillary</b> (underarm) <b>area.</b> Thus, Newton 2 ̆ 7 s Law is proven true- what does not go up, will not come down...|$|R
40|$|A 60 -year-old African American man {{presented}} to our hospi-tal with a 6 -month history of progressively worsening fatigue, 30 -pound weight loss, jaundice, pruritis, dark urine, and straining on urination. He reported no previous intrave-nous drug use. His physical exam revealed nontender lymph-adenopathy involving the anterior cervical, <b>axillary,</b> and inguinal <b>areas.</b> The rectal exam revealed irregularity {{of the left}} prostatic border. Initial laboratory results were signifi-cant for hyperbilirubinemia (9. 3 mg/dL) with direct bilirubin predominance (7. 9 mg/dL), as well as elevated aspartate aminotransferase (200 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (169 IU/L), and alkaline phosphatase (1803 IU/L) with predomi-nant hepatic origin evidenced by elevated liver isoenzyme (1352 IU/L) and γ-glutamyltransferase (2152 IU/L).

40|$|AbstractComma {{hair has}} been {{described}} as a specific dermoscopic feature of tinea capitis, however, it is not always present. Recognition of the additional dermoscopic features is therefore important. Furthermore, comma hair has never been shown to be applicable in fungal infection of the hair follicles on other parts of the body such as the eyebrows, <b>axillary,</b> or pubic <b>areas.</b> We encountered 13 Taiwanese patients who had been diagnosed with tinea capitis and evaluated their dermoscopic features using a nonpolarized, contact-type dermoscopic instrument with alcohol as the interface medium. Herein, we describe a woman with fungal infection of the eyebrow and present the under-recognized zigzag hair and bar code-like hairs for the first time...|$|R
