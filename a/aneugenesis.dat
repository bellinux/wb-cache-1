40|$|Ptaquiloside, a norsesquiterpene {{glycoside}} from bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), is a known carcinogen towards animals. Its genotoxicity {{is mainly}} attributed to its DNA-alkylating and clastogenic properties. This study analyses various modes of genotoxic action of ptaquiloside in human mononuclear blood cells. The alkaline comet assay {{was performed on}} cells exposed to 5 μg/ml ptaquiloside for 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 min. Tail length {{was used as a}} DNA-damage parameter. Assays to determine structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations and sister-chromatid exchange were conducted on cells exposed to 5, 10 or 20 μg/ml ptaquiloside for 48 h. The tail length showed maximum DNA damage at 20 - 30 min, diminishing onwards. Highly significant (p< 0. 001) dose-dependent increases in structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations and SCE were observed in response to ptaquiloside. These results indicate that ptaquiloside is not only a DNA-alkylating agent, but expresses its genotoxicity through multiple mechanisms including clastogenesis, <b>aneugenesis</b> and the mechanism underlying SCE induction, which is not entirely understood. Recent studies support the role played by aneuploidy in oncogenesis, highlighting the importance of this endpoint for mutagenicity screening. SCE are thought to represent the long-term effects of mutagens and are an important genotoxicity biomarker. The present results also agree with data from epidemiological studies and from animal in vivo studies, further supporting the hypothesis that ptaquiloside may represent a significant threat to human health...|$|E
