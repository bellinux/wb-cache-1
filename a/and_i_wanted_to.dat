5|$|Leroux {{was one of}} 21 {{professional}} athletes featured in ESPN's The Body Issue in 2013. She appeared semi-nude on one of eight covers for the magazine. Of the experience she said, I {{think a lot of}} females struggle with the way they look, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> show that everyone's body is different. I think it's a big deal to be an athlete and feel confident in your body and show it off. I'm not going to say I've never struggled with how I look, but I've reached a point in my life where I'm happy with who I am.|$|E

25|$|I didn't {{have the}} luxury - and I {{consider}} it a luxury - of being a protester because my focus was concentrated on getting information. I knew I wasn't {{going to be in}} that position for very long. I wanted to participate in gathering whatever information I could in the time I had, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> bring it all together, really to see what would happen. I needed time to work by myself.|$|E

25|$|It wasn't easy to {{find the}} YPSL in Columbia, Missouri. But I had read about it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be one. We had a very limited number of {{activities}} in Columbia, Missouri. We had an anti-Franco rally, which was a worthy cause. You could raise a question about how relevant it {{was likely to be}} in Columbia, Missouri, but it was in any case a worthy cause. We also planned a socialist picnic, which we spent quite a lot of time organizing. Eventually, I regret to say, the YPSL chapter, after much discussion, many debates and some downright quarrels, broke up over the socialist picnic. I thought that was rather discouraging.|$|E
25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox. We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E
500|$|I {{started writing}} what I felt was Bat Out of Hell part 2, {{definitely}} like The Godfather part I and part 2, that's how I saw it. I {{wanted to do}} a continuation <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do an album that went even further and that was more extreme, if possible, which a lot of people felt wasn't possible but I just wanted to see if I could make a record that was even more heroic because that's what I thought of it ... Bat Out of Hell to me was ultimately very heroic though it was funny ... <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do one that to me would be even more heroic and more epic and a little more operatic and passionate.|$|E

[...] Upon signing the contract he stated, [...] "I wanted to retire as a Giant because it's where my career began. They were people who believed in my talents and helped mold me into the man I am today, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> thank them for that." ...|$|E
500|$|With the {{publication}} in 2005 {{of an issue}} of Green Arrow in which Anarky guest-starred, writer James Peaty juxtaposed Anarky's radical philosophy with the liberal progressive beliefs of Green Arrow: [...] "Everyone always goes on about what a radical Ollie is <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> show that maybe that isn't the case... especially as Ollie's radical credentials are pretty antiquated... Anarky as a character—and as a broader idea—is much more radical than Ollie." ...|$|E
500|$|After unsuccessfully {{trying to}} persuade the referee to change his {{decision}} about the penalty, Fowler took it tamely and Seaman saved. However, Seaman failed {{to hold on to}} the ball and Jason McAteer scored from the rebound. Although many people believe that he deliberately took the penalty kick poorly for reasons of fair play, Fowler said at the time: [...] "As a goalscorer it's part of my job to take it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> score it. I tried to score. I never missed on purpose. It just happened, it was a bad penalty." ...|$|E

Alex Ifimov did the make-up and hair styling for the video, and collaborated with Ema Băniță for its styling. Regarding the clip, the singer said, [...] "I have an affinity for Asia, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> capture the Asian culture and atmosphere on the streets, the people and their customs. I met many lovely people that helped us with the filming and even wanted to appear in the clip. It was an unforgettable experience." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{happened}} to be at Cambridge. I was sent there by the [...] government on a government grant. And I'd read some of Ted's poems in this magazine and I was very impressed <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> meet him. I went to this little celebration and that's actually where we met... Then we saw {{a great deal of}} each other. Ted came back to Cambridge and suddenly we found ourselves getting married a few months later... We kept writing poems to each other. Then it just grew out of that, I guess, a feeling that we both were writing so much and having such a fine time doing it, we decided that this should keep on.|$|E
500|$|After {{defeating}} Nikolay Davydenko at Wimbledon 2012, Murray pointed upwards {{with both}} hands and wagged them back and forth while looking to the sky. Murray declined to reveal the reason, and ever since, he has continued to celebrate his victories with this gesture. Murray marked his first Wimbledon title in 2013 with the same victory salute. Then in his book 'Seventy-Seven; My Path to Wimbledon Glory', released in November 2013, Murray said: “The real reason is that around that time I had a few friends and family who had various issues affecting them [...] [...] [...] I knew that they would be watching <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> let them know I was thinking of them.” ...|$|E

500|$|Carpenter {{originally}} {{wrote the}} screenplay for Escape from New York in 1976, {{in the aftermath}} of the Watergate scandal. Carpenter said, [...] "The whole feeling of the nation was one of real cynicism about the President. I wrote the screenplay and no studio wanted to make it" [...] because, according to Carpenter, [...] "it was too violent, too scary, too weird." [...] He had been inspired by the film Death Wish, which was very popular at the time. He did not agree with this film's philosophy but liked how it conveyed [...] "the sense of New York as a kind of jungle, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make a science fiction film along these lines".|$|E
500|$|The initial {{creative}} {{team was}} writer Jamie Delano and artist John Ridgway, with Dave McKean supplying distinctive painted and collage covers. Delano introduced a political aspect to the character, about which he stated: [...] "...generally I {{was interested in}} commenting on 1980s Britain. That was where I was living, it was shit, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> tell everybody." [...] The book, originally published as a regular DC Comics title, became a Vertigo title with the imprint's launch in March 1993 (issue #63 of the series). In October 2011, {{it was announced that}} this would join DC titles in being published digitally on the same day as its physical release, starting in January 2012.|$|E
500|$|Meyer-Landrut {{decided to}} take part in the talent show Unser Star für Oslo (Our Star for Oslo), a newly created {{national}} television programme to select the German entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 in Oslo. The show was organised by public broadcaster ARD and private television station ProSieben, as well as entertainer, music producer and former Eurovision entrant Stefan Raab. Among 4,500 entrants, Meyer-Landrut was picked as one of the 20 contestants for the show. Asked about her motivation to apply, she stated, [...] "I like to test myself. I wanted to see how I am perceived, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> hear what people with knowledge have to say about it. I personally can't judge myself at all." ...|$|E

500|$|Whedon {{approached}} Nathan Fillion to {{play the}} lead role of Malcolm Reynolds; after Whedon explained the premise and showed him the treatment for the pilot, Fillion was eager for the role. Fillion was called back several times to read for the part before he was cast. He noted that [...] "it was really thrilling. It was my first lead and I was pretty nervous, but I really wanted that part <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> tell those stories." [...] Fillion later said he was [...] "heartbroken" [...] when he learned the series had been cancelled. Fillion has called his time on Firefly the best acting job he ever had, and compares every job {{he has had to}} it.|$|E
500|$|The Italian-American 1950s-inspired music video, {{directed}} by Joseph Kahn, was shot {{back to back}} with the video for the song [...] "LoveGame" [...] on the weekend of January 9, 2009 in Los Angeles. About the video, Gaga explained that [...] "I wanted to show a different side of myself— perhaps a more domestic girly side. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> create beautiful, stunning '50s futuristic fashion imagery that would burn holes in everyone's brains." [...] She further clarified that for the fashion aspects in the video {{she wanted to go}} in an opposite direction to her usual image. She wanted a yellow based wardrobe believing the color to become a big hit in the fashion world in 2009.|$|E
500|$|The {{songs are}} highly {{influenced}} by traditional world music, particularly African and Brazilian music, with Gabriel using the distinctive drum beat from these styles. In a 2011 interview for Uncut, Gabriel said, [...] "I'd had my fill of instrumental experimenting for a while, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> write proper pop songs, albeit {{on my own}} terms." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times notes that Gabriel [...] "doesn't just add on African drums or Indian violin to ordinary songs; {{they are part of}} the foundation." [...] Daniel Lanois' production was noted as textured, replete with ambient details and [...] "immaculate warmth giving each note room to breathe, its textures lavish (in the preferred style of the time) without being sterile".|$|E
