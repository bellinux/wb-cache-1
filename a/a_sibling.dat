5|$|Bovidae have {{featured}} in stories {{since at least}} the time of Aesop's fables from Ancient Greece around 600 BC. Fables by Aesop include The Crow and the Sheep, The Frog and the Ox, and The Wolf and the Lamb. The mythological creature Chimera, depicted as a lion, with the head of a goat arising from its back, and a tail that might end with a snake's head, was one of the offspring of Typhon and Echidna and <b>a</b> <b>sibling</b> of such monsters as Cerberus and the Lernaean Hydra. The sheep, synonymous with the goat in Chinese mythology, is the eighth animal of the Chinese zodiac, and a symbol of filial piety.|$|E
5|$|Chesney's family {{originated}} from Quesnay-Guesnon in the Calvados region of Normandy near Bayeux in France, {{but they had}} settled in the Midlands of England and held lands there, particularly in Oxfordshire. His parents were Roger de Chesney and Alice de Langetot. His brother William de Chesney remained a layman, {{and became one of}} Oxfordshire's leading landowners. Another brother, Reginald, was the abbot of Evesham Abbey. Chesney's sister Agnes was married to Robert Foliot, steward to the Earl of Huntingdon. Agnes and Robert were probably the parents of Gilbert Foliot, later Bishop of Hereford and Bishop of London. Although it is a surmise that Foliot's mother was <b>a</b> <b>sibling</b> of Chesney, it is certain that Chesney was Gilbert's uncle.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} if having <b>an</b> older <b>sibling</b> {{was significantly related}} to stronger selfregulation and achievement, in a sample of 74 preschool children participating in a selfregulation intervention. It was hypothesized that children with <b>an</b> older <b>sibling</b> in the fall would have higher self-regulation and achievement scores than children with no older siblings, and that children with <b>an</b> older <b>sibling</b> in the intervention would improve more across the year in selfregulation and achievement than children with <b>an</b> older <b>sibling</b> in the control group. Results showed that having <b>an</b> older <b>sibling</b> significantly predicted higher vocabulary and math scores in the fall of preschool. In addition, children with <b>an</b> older <b>sibling</b> in the intervention group had significantly higher vocabulary scores than children with <b>an</b> older <b>sibling</b> in the control group in the spring. Findings indicate that older siblings have an important influence on the early development of vocabulary skills in preschool children...|$|R

5|$|A {{report by}} Baldassare Ceola, the police {{commissioner}} of Palermo, {{concluded that the}} crime had probably been carried out by Mafiosi Carlo Costantino and Antonino Passananti under Cascioferro's direction. Evidence was thin, however, and the case was effectively closed when in July 1911 the Palermo Court of Appeals discharged Cascioferro, as well as Costantino and Passananti, due to insufficient evidence {{to send them to}} trial. Petrosino's murder was never solved. Nevertheless, Costantino and Passananti were identified as the most likely assassins. Costantino died in the late 1930s and Passananti, in March 1969. In 2014, more than a century after the assassination, the Italian police overheard a tapped phone conversation in which <b>a</b> <b>sibling</b> claimed that Paolo Palazzotto had been the killer on the orders of Cascioferro. Palazzotto had been arrested after the shooting, but had been released for lack of evidence.|$|E
5|$|Coenwulf (also spelled Cenwulf, Kenulf, or Kenwulph) was King of Mercia from December 796 {{until his}} death in 821. He was a {{descendant}} of <b>a</b> <b>sibling</b> of King Penda, who had ruled Mercia {{in the middle of the}} 7th century. He succeeded Ecgfrith, the son of Offa; Ecgfrith only reigned for five months, and Coenwulf ascended to the throne in the same year that Offa died. In the early years of Coenwulf's reign he had to deal with a revolt in Kent, which had been under Offa's control. Eadberht Præn returned from exile in Francia to claim the Kentish throne, and Coenwulf was forced to wait for papal support before he could intervene. When Pope Leo agreed to anathematize Eadberht, Coenwulf invaded and retook the kingdom; Eadberht was taken prisoner, was blinded, and had his hands cut off. Coenwulf also appears to have lost control of the kingdom of East Anglia during the early part of his reign, as an independent coinage appears under King Eadwald. Coenwulf's coinage reappears in 805, indicating that the kingdom was again under Mercian control. Several campaigns of Coenwulf's against the Welsh are recorded, but only one conflict with Northumbria, in 801, though it is likely that Coenwulf continued to support the opponents of the Northumbrian king Eardwulf.|$|E
5|$|The suspect (later {{identified}} as David Lace) was discovered when {{the profile of}} the killer showed a partial match on the national database, which belonged to <b>a</b> <b>sibling</b> of a previous suspect. A further sample was taken from another sibling, who was not on the database, to help confirm the match via a process called familial searching. At first the police refused to release the identity of the new prime suspect, except to reveal that he had committed suicide in 1988, and had confessed to DeSimone's murder while in custody for an unrelated crime in 1983, 18 months after Hodgson's conviction. His body was exhumed at Kingston cemetery in Portsmouth on 12 August 2009 in order to compare his DNA to that found at the crime scene. Hampshire Constabulary said the breakthrough in the case was only possible because of advances in forensic science and tests on the body would take six weeks, after which a file on the dead suspect could then be submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service. Visitors to the cemetery in Portsmouth said the grave of the suspect had no headstone and was untended. Police revealed that the suspect's confession was one of seven which had been made since Hodgson's conviction.|$|E

40|$|IMPORTANCETo date, this is {{the first}} {{population-based}} study to examine the recurrence risk for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), including time trends, and the first study to consider the ASDs recurrence risk for full- and half-siblings. OBJECTIVESTo estimate the relative recurrence risk for ASDs in a Danish population, including recurrence in full- and half-siblings, and to examine time trends in ASDs relative to the recurrence risk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTSPopulation-based cohort study in Denmark.

40|$|This work {{considers}} {{the impact that}} <b>a</b> new <b>sibling</b> has on <b>a</b> child?s health status. Objective health outcomes are observed before a new addition(s) to the family, with the same outcomes being observed afterwards. In addition, this work examines whether planning matters {{with respect to this}} dilution effect. That is, we argue that dilution effects should be higher in the event that <b>an</b> additional <b>sibling</b> is unplanned. To our knowledge this is unexplored in the literature with respect to all areas of parental resource allocation. The data used relates to a sample of approximately 2000 children from Peru. These children?s parents have been surveyed at 1 year and again at 5 years. To test our hypothesis we exploit data from both waves of the survey. For health outcomes the impact on height for age z scores and weight for age z scores are considered. The results highlight significant independent effects on both height and weight for age when <b>an</b> unplanned <b>sibling</b> is added to the household. In addition, the results show that it is the most vulnerable children that are impacted the most by <b>an</b> unplanned <b>sibling.</b> <b>A</b> subsequent analysis highlights that it is the lowest socio- economic households that are the most likely to have <b>an</b> unplanned <b>sibling.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This work {{considers}} whether planning matters {{with respect}} to the effect of <b>a</b> new <b>sibling</b> on another siblings' health. Objective health outcomes are observed before and after a new addition to the family. To date, the literature on family size has focused on a quality-quantity trade-off; the more children in a family, the less resources devoted to each child. We present a theoretical framework which highlights that the quantity-quality trade-off may only be relevant in the case of <b>an</b> unplanned <b>sibling.</b> We also suggest that <b>a</b> planned <b>sibling</b> may result in health gains for the other children. We use two waves of data for more than 1800 children from Peru from the Young Lives Project to test our hypothesis. The data relate to the children at 1 and 5 years. For health outcomes, height for age and weight for age Z are considered. The results highlight significant negative independent effects on height for age when <b>an</b> unplanned <b>sibling</b> is added to the household. In addition, we find positive sibling effects on height for age when <b>a</b> planned <b>sibling</b> arrives. We find only small planning effects for weight for age. We view our hypothesis as a pathway that can further explain the quantity-quality trade-off...|$|R

40|$|Hematopoietic cell {{transplantation}} (HCT) remains the fundamental procedure to treat many diseases. Its success depends greatly {{on the degree}} of HLA matching between donor and recipient. Although the number of successful HCT procedures carried out worldwide increases every year, many patients remain unable to receive this treatment because of the difficulty of finding an HLA-matching donor. In our center, we identified the HLA types for all HCT candidates and their siblings in an attempt to determine the chance of finding <b>a</b> full HLA-matching <b>sibling.</b> Overall, 60 % of patients had a chance of finding <b>an</b> HLA-matching <b>sibling.</b> The chance of finding <b>a</b> matching <b>sibling</b> was 43 % in patients aged birth to 5 years, compared with 68 % in those aged 20 + years. In our Saudi population, patients in need of HCT have a greater chance of finding <b>an</b> HLA-matching <b>sibling</b> than is reported in most Western countries. This is mainly because of the larger number of siblings in most Saudi families. Younger children requiring HCT have a lesser chance of finding <b>an</b> HLA-matching <b>sibling.</b> Our data demonstrate that even in a country with relatively large families, it is still essential to consider alternative donor strategies, such as adult unrelated donors, unrelated umbilical cord blood units, and haploidentical donors...|$|R
