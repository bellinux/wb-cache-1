5000|$|Like other typical gomphotheres, Amebelodon possessed {{two sets}} of tusks, one upper set, (much like those found on modern elephants), and one lower set that {{extended}} from the very front of the lower jaws. However, as mentioned above, the lower tusks of the Amebelodon were distinctive in that they were relatively long, slender, and flattened. Because of the resemblance of these lower tusks to shovels, Amebelodon is {{commonly referred to as}} a [...] "shovel-tusked" [...] gomphothere (another shovel-tusked gomphothere {{that may or may not}} be closely related to Amebelodon is Platybelodon). There has long been an assumption that these lower tusks were actually used as shovels by the animal during feeding, presumably to dig up water plants. However, an analysis of wear patterns has shown that these lower tusks were most likely used in a variety of ways in addition to shoveling, including scraping bark from trees. Overall, the evidence indicates that this animal was a versatile browser (an animal that eats broad-leaved plants rather than grass), feeding in both wet and dry settings in a variety of ways. For reasons that are not clearly explained in the literature, Amebelodon is usually portrayed with a short, flap-like trunk (this is true of the <b>associated</b> <b>picture).</b> However, considerable evidence indicates that Amebelodon actually had a long, flexible trunk very much like that found in modern elephants, and that it probably was important for feeding, drinking, etc.|$|E
50|$|The Boston Bruins met the St. Louis Blues in the 1970 Stanley Cup Finals. The Blues {{were swept}} in {{consecutive}} Cup Finals {{the previous two}} years, and this year would be no different. The Bruins were in firm control after three games, having blown out the Blues in each game, with a combined goal differential of 16-4. Game 4 in Boston was tied 3-3 {{at the end of}} regulation. Just 40 seconds into the first overtime, Bruins defenseman Bobby Orr took a pass from Derek Sanderson and skated on Blues goalie Glenn Hall, who opened the crease and his legs to prepare for Orr's impending shot. Orr shot it directly through Hall's five-hole (between the legs), and once seeing it go through, jumped in elation. This also caused him to be tripped by Blues defensemen Noel Picard. Orr went flying through the air in a directly horizontal manner, about four feet off of the ice in a Superman-esque pose. The Bruins won their first Stanley Cup since 1941. This goal also served as the first of two Stanley Cup clinching goals that Orr would score in his career (the other coming in game 6 of the 1972 Stanley Cup Finals), which also helped him to his first of two Conn Smythe Trophies for playoff MVP. From there, the goal, and its <b>associated</b> <b>picture</b> (with Orr celebrating in mid-air surrounded by a cheering Boston crowd), became arguably the most famous in NHL history. Orr was elected into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1979, with a record eight consecutive Norris Trophy wins, and two Conn Smythe Trophies punctuating his career.|$|E

40|$|This {{multiple}} {{single case}} study contrasted left hemisphere stroke patients (N = 6) to healthy age-matched control participants (N = 15) on {{their understanding of}} action (e. g., holding, clenching) and motion verbs (e. g., crumbling, flowing). The tasks required participants to correctly identify the matching verb or <b>associated</b> <b>picture.</b> Dissociations on action and motion verb content depending on lesion site were expected. As predicted for verbs containing an action and/or motion content, modified t-tests confirmed selective deficits in processing motion verbs in patients with lesions involving posterior parietal and lateral occipitotemporal cortex. In contrast, deficits in verbs describing motionless actions were found in patients with more anterior lesions sparing posterior parietal and lateral occipitotemporal cortex. These findings support the hypotheses that semantic representations for action and motion are behaviorally and neuro-anatomically dissociable. The findings clarify the differential and critical role of perceptual and motor regions in processing modality-specific semantic knowledge {{as opposed to a}} supportive but not necessary role. We contextualize these results within theories from both cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience that make claims over the role of sensory and motor information in semantic representation...|$|E

40|$|Explicit {{associative}} memory relies on different neural substrates depending on similarity {{of the items}} associated. Extant literature dissociates old/new effects elicited by homogeneous and heterogeneous pairs. However, current results scarcely address potential priming effects induced by the presentation sequence. In the present ERP study, participants learned associations between two pictures, which either belonged to the same semantic category (e. g., animal-animal), or to different categories (e. g., animal-scene). Pictures forming a pair were shown sequentially, allowing for investigation of the different neural processes related to presentation {{of the first and}} the second item. After the study phase, participants performed a recognition judgment. After recognition, participants were asked to recall the <b>associated</b> <b>picture.</b> During retrieval, between 260 and 350. ms post-stimulus there was a significant frontal effect of category (i. e., same-category versus different-category), but only for items shown first within a pair. In the 350 - 600. ms time window the parietal old/new effect was unaffected by semantic category, but was modulated by presentation order. Exploratory analyses revealed even earlier effects in the time windows 40 - 90. ms and 150 - 200. ms. This evidence supports the priming account of the FN 400 and highlights the importance of sequence effects in electrophysiological activity during episodic retrieval...|$|E

40|$|Prior {{research}} has identified several regions where neural activity is enhanced when recollection of episodic information is successful. Here, we investigated whether these regions dissociate {{according to whether}} recollection-related activity is transient or sustained across the time that recollected information must be maintained prior to a behavioral judgment. Human subjects studied a series of word-picture pairs under the requirement to judge which of the denoted objects was smaller. Following each of 4 study sessions, a scanned test phase occurred in which a series of studied and unstudied words was presented. The requirement at test was to judge whether each word was old or new and, if judged old, to retrieve the associated study picture and hold it in mind until a cue appeared. The delay interval varied between two and eight seconds. The cue instructed subjects which of three different judgments should {{be applied to the}} retrieved picture.

Relative to studied words for which the <b>associated</b> <b>picture</b> could not be retrieved, words giving rise to successful recollection elicited transient responses in the hippocampus/parahippocampal cortex and retrosplenial cortex, and to sustained activity in prefrontal cortex, the intra-parietal sulcus, the left angular gyrus and the inferior temporal gyrus.

40|$|Explicit {{encoding}} requires {{humans to}} select the information relevant to their goals, yet not all irrelevant information is discarded. The present study addressed how different quantity and relevance of information modulate the electrophysiological activity during the encoding and retrieval phases of a recognition memory task. Subjects learned associations between two semantically unrelated pictures, and then performed a recognition judgment. After recognition, {{subjects were asked to}} recall the <b>associated</b> <b>picture</b> by using the recognized image as a cue. Cues yielded either high quantity of information (the cue evoked two associations, only one of them being relevant to the task), or low quantity of information (the cue evoked a single, relevant association). At encoding, a negative peak (400. ms) showed reduced negativity at left sites for the associative trials compared to the non-associative ones, while at right frontal sites the peak was more negative for goal-unrelated associations, compared to goal-related ones. Late right negativity during the test phase (800 - 1000 ms) discriminated hits followed either by correct or by no recall, but only when the cue evoked multiple associations. Frontal electrophysiological asymmetry at encoding was affected by the behavioral goal, i. e. activity reflected goal-related encoding on the left and goal-unrelated encoding on the right. The late right effect at retrieval suggests a link between this activity during encoding and the evaluation of the higher quantity of information in light of the behavioral goal during retrieval. Overall, the results indicate that different mechanisms and/or neuronal populations are involved in goal-related versus goal-unrelated association...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate relationships between semantic and perceptual levels of representation. A picture - word repetition paradigm was used in which we manipulated the semantic relationship between pictures and words. Experiment I involved two types of trials, one with words that had the same meaning as pictures and one with words that were unrelated to pictures. In Experiment 2 we replaced words that were identical in meaning with words that were semantically associated to pictures. In both experiments, visually presented probe stimuli were used to determine the presence of perceptual effects within the visual system, originating from the semantic interaction between words and pictures. In both experiments, conditions with unrelated picture - word pairs generated a search process following the N 400 which included activity overlying the visual cortex. Probe stimuli were found to attenuate the amplitude of the search related negativity. The latency of the interaction, which was significant {{at the time of the}} NI response to the probe, suggested that the attempt to find a relationship between the picture and the word involved processing within extrastriate visual areas. UVF probes provided stronger attenuation, possibly because the UVF has direct transmission to the ventral processing stream which is believed to be involved in visual semantic processing. Semantic interactions between matching picture - word pairs in Experiment I were found to have an effect on the ERPs to probes presented at the same location as pictures. Probes presented under these conditions showed a stronger P 2 over frontal areas followed by a more negative P 3 over occipital areas. Although we had expected beforehand to find earlier effects in the latency of the probes' PI and NI responses, this result is consistent with the idea that retinotopic levels of object representation are linked with the semantic level of object description. Unlike Experiment 1, same location probes presented in <b>associated</b> <b>picture</b> - word conditions of Experiment 2 did not result in any specific ERP effects on the P 2 and P 3 components. This suggest that semantic interactions between pictures and words do not automatically propagate to the perceptual level, unless there is direct reference from the word to the visual representation of the object.
