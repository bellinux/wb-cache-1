5|$|Located at {{the highest}} point of the Municipality lies El Volcan, a small {{mountain}} of about 1500 meters from sea level. This mountain has a Downhill course that has about 500 meters of vertical drop, it is used by hundreds of riders a day during dry and wet weather, mostly on weekends. The course {{is open to the}} public and riding is neither specifically allowed nor prohibited by law. The trails are also used by hikers <b>all</b> <b>week</b> long. Shuttles are about 10 Venezuelan bolivars per trip, they run from the parking lot of a Farmatodo drug store in La Boyera, up to the summit using public avenues and paved roads, taking from 15 minutes to 30 minutes depending on traffic on the area. The course apart from being used mostly for recreational purpose, also has been used for irregularly scheduled downhill races due to the lack of organisation in the riders community.|$|E
5|$|Woods had a poor showing at the 2013 U.S Open as {{a result}} of an elbow injury {{sustained}} at The Players Championship. In finishing at 13-over-par, he recorded his worst score ever as a professional and finished 12 strokes behind winner Justin Rose. After a prolonged break because of the injury, during which he missed the Greenbrier Classic and his own AT National, he returned at the Open Championship at Muirfield. Despite being in contention <b>all</b> <b>week</b> and beginning the final round only two strokes behind Lee Westwood, he struggled with the speed of the greens and could only manage a 3-over-par 74 that left him tied for 6th place, five strokes behind eventual winner Phil Mickelson. Two weeks later, Woods returned to form at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, recording his 5th win of the season and 8th win at the event in its 15-year history. His second round 61 matched his record score on the PGA Tour and could easily have been a 59 were it not for some short missed birdie putts on the closing holes. This gave him a seven stroke lead that he held onto for the rest of the tournament. Woods would never contend at the PGA Championship at Oak Hill Country Club and would come short of winning a major for the 5th full season, only contending in two of the four majors in 2013.|$|E

When Percy crashed the #15 car after a throttle jammed, the race was a straight fight between Perkins/Hansford and the Skaife/Richards car.

40|$|Background: Irritable bowel {{syndrome}} (IBS) is {{a common}} gastrointestinal disorder. Recent studies suggest the importance of gut flora in the pathophysiology of it. Therefore, antibiotics have demonstrated a substantial benefit to reduce gut flora. Having few side effects, and applying one-dose per day, we studied the effect of azithromycin to treat IBS. Materials and Methods: One hundred and twenty-six patients enrolled a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The treatment group received azithromycin in addition to common treatment. Patients were followed for 12 weeks. Patients completed daily diaries documenting their symptoms. Results: One hundred and thirteen patients completed the study. The onset of relief occurred significantly sooner, and duration of relief was significantly longer in azithromycin group. Movement, abdominal pain, bloating, and gas were significantly better in azithromycin group. Monthly results showed superior relief in bloating, gas, overall symptom, and overall bloating during 3 months. Significantly more patients in azithromycin group felt relief in bloating and gas and had greater consistency relief in almost <b>all</b> <b>weeks.</b> Conclusion: In our study, azithromycin significantly relieved most symptoms, such as abdominal pain, bloating, and gas. Overall symptom and overall bloating were relieved significantly in more patients in the intervention group in <b>all</b> <b>weeks...</b>|$|R

Fearing the speedy Maynard, the Colts decided to rotate their zone defense to help cover Maynard, leaving Sauer covered {{one-on-one}} by Lenny Lyles, helping Sauer catch 8 passes for 133 yards, including a crucial third quarter 39-yard reception that kept a scoring drive alive. The Jets kept rushing Snell to their strong left, rushing off tackle with Boozer blocking the linebacker, and gained first down after first down as the Colts defense gave ground. The Colts defense was more concerned about Maynard, the passing game, and the deep threat of a Namath to Maynard touchdown. Although the Colts were unaware of Maynard's injury, the Jets were aware that Lyles had been weakened by tonsillitis <b>all</b> <b>week,</b> causing them great glee when they saw the one-on-one matchup with Sauer.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{analysis}} of antigen-specific cytokine expression {{has been considered}} to evaluate the immune responses and vaccines efficacy in recent years. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the cell-mediated immune response characteristics of two Capri pox virus (CaPV) vaccines against lumpy skin disease in cattle. Materials and Methods: Two Capri pox virus vaccines were administered to dairy cows of two farms and followed up to 5 weeks post vaccination. These vaccines were live attenuated Goat pox virus (GTP) Gorgan strain (n= 20) and Sheep pox virus (SPP) Romanian strain (n= 20). Cell-mediated immune response of vaccinated calves was evaluated using in vitro lymphocyte proliferation and IFN-g and IL- 4 release assay after stimulation with recall vaccine strains, and in vivo cytokine expression in PBMCs by real-time PCR. Results: Lymphocyte proliferation in GTP- and SPP-vaccinated groups began to increase till reached to its peak at third week post vaccination and then decreased in the weeks thereafter. Stimulation index in stimulated PBMCs in GTP-vaccinated calves was higher than SPP-vaccinated calves in <b>all</b> <b>weeks,</b> which indicated higher levels of immunogenicity produced by the GTP-vaccine in cattle. Also, in both vaccinated groups the peak release of IFN-g and IL- 4 proteins in cultured PBMCs in response to recall antigen was detected at week 3 post vaccination. Although the mean of the cytokine release in GTP-vaccinated calves was higher than SPP-vaccinated calves in <b>all</b> <b>weeks</b> of experiment, a significant difference was only observed at week 3 post vaccination (P< 0. 05). In contrast, the IFN-g mRNA expression in PBMCs of vaccinated groups was induced early, peaked at week 1 post vaccination and decreased in the weeks thereafter, and this rate was higher in GTP-vaccinated calves compared with SPP-vaccinated calves in <b>all</b> <b>weeks,</b> but the significant difference was only found at week 3 post vaccination (P< 0. 05). However, the IL- 4 mRNA expression showed delayed induction and peaked at week 3, and unlike the SPP group, it remained at this level in GTP group, until the end of experiment. Also this rate of expression in GTP-vaccinated calves was higher than SPP-vaccinated calves in <b>all</b> <b>weeks</b> and had a significant increase at week 5 post vaccination (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: The findings show that due to induction of high level cell-mediated immune response in live attenuated GTP vaccine compared to SPP vaccine, GTP vaccine has a good immunogenic response, and therefore can be a better choice for vaccination against lumpy skin disease...|$|R
