5|$|The Art of War is {{traditionally}} ascribed to Sun Tzu. It presents <b>a</b> <b>philosophy</b> <b>of</b> war for managing conflicts and winning battles.

5|$|Macdonald was {{considered}} one of his province's most eloquent political orators. He articulated <b>a</b> <b>philosophy</b> <b>of</b> provincial autonomy, arguing that poorer provinces needed a greater share of national tax revenues to pay for health, education and welfare. He contended that Nova Scotians were victims of a national policy that protected the industries of Ontario and Quebec with steep tariffs forcing people to pay higher prices for manufactured goods. It was no accident, Macdonald said, that Nova Scotia had gone from the richest province per capita before Canadian Confederation in 1867 to poorest by the 1930s.|$|E

5|$|The {{attitude}} of the United States was also influenced by the Monroe Doctrine, <b>a</b> <b>philosophy</b> <b>of</b> foreign policy articulated by James Monroe in 1823, and which justified the maintenance of US hegemony in the region. The stated aim of the doctrine was to maintain order and stability and {{to make certain that}} access to resources and markets was not limited. The historian Mark Gilderhus states that the doctrine also contained racially condescending language, which likened Latin American countries to fighting children. The US government did not need to engage in military interventions in Guatemala to enforce this hegemony, given the presence of military rulers friendly to the US; nevertheless, the doctrine was used to justify the coup in 1954.|$|E
