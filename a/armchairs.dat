5|$|The {{crinoline}} {{needed to}} be rigid enough to support the skirts in their accustomed shape, but also flexible enough to be temporarily pressed out of shape and spring back afterwards. Other materials used for crinolines included whalebone, gutta-percha and vulcanised caoutchouc (natural rubber). The idea of inflatable hoops was short-lived as they were easily punctured, prone to collapse, and due {{to the use of}} brimstone in the manufacture of rubber, they smelled unpleasant. Although hard rubber hoops of gutta-percha worked satisfactorily at first, they were brittle and easily crushed without recovering their form. Despite objections that the sharp points of snapped steels were hazardous, lightweight steel was clearly the most successful option. It reduced the number of petticoats and their weight, and offered increased freedom of movement of the legs. However, hasty or careless movements in a hoop skirt could lead to accidentally revealing more than intended. An advertisement published in The Lady's Newspaper in 1863 for a cage crinoline with waved hoops attempted to reassure the potential customer that while wearing it, activities such as climbing stairs, passing to her theatre seat, dropping into <b>armchairs</b> and leaning against furniture would be possible without hindrance either to herself or to others around her.|$|E

Originally the Epicurian Room, and renamed the Escoffier Restaurant in 1974, the restaurant originally served classical French cuisine in an old-fashioned formal French dining room. It had French chandeliers, gilded mirrors, patterned carpets, and high-backed chairs. The redesign intended it to now resemble a brasserie, with polished steel lights, smoked-oak floors, and bentwood <b>armchairs.</b>|$|E

Congress appropriated $6,000 to finally finish the room in 1826, although the funds were not made available until 1825. President John Quincy Adams used the money to repair the White House rather than finish the room.|$|E

The house mascot of Slytherin is the serpent, and the house colours are green and silver. Salazar Slytherin founded the house. The Head of House is Severus Snape until the seventh book. Then, Horace Slughorn, the previous Head of House, comes out of retirement re-assuming authority after Snape becomes headmaster. The ghost of Slytherin house is The Bloody Baron. According to Rowling, Slytherin corresponds roughly to the element of water. The Slytherin dormitories and common room are reached through a bare stone wall in the dungeons. The Slytherin common room is a long, low, dungeon-style room, under the Hogwarts Lake, furnished with green lamps and carved <b>armchairs.</b> The room is described in the second book as having a greenish glow.|$|E

25|$|Federal style furniture, made by Georgetown {{craftsman}} William King, Jr., {{was added}} to the East Room by President James Monroe in 1818. (First Lady Elizabeth Monroe's involvement was limited to choosing drapery fabric for the room). King produced 24 <b>armchairs</b> and four sofas, all made of mahogany. The total cost was $1,408. The furniture was not upholstered, and sat along the walls largely unused. The King furniture was finally upholstered in blue damask silk in 1829 {{in the first year of}} the Jackson administration. Monroe also purchased (for $80) a marble bust of George Washington by the Italian sculptor Giuseppe Ceracchi, which remained in the East Room probably until the Kennedy redecoration in 1962 (when it was moved to the Blue Room). Monroe also purchased in 1817 for the fireplace mantels four gilt bronze candelabra, designed and manufactured by the French bronzemaker Pierre-Philippe Thomire.|$|E
25|$|The eastward {{drawing room}} is adorned with themes from the Lohengrin legend. The furnituresofa, table, <b>armchairs</b> and seats in a northward alcoveis {{comfortable}} and homelike. Next {{to the drawing}} room is a little artificial grotto that forms the passage to the study. The unusual room, originally equipped with an artificial waterfall and a so-called rainbow machine, is connected to a little conservatory. Depicting the Hörselberg grotto, it relates to Wagner's Tannhäuser, as does the décor of the adjacent study. In the park of Linderhof Palace the king had installed a similar grotto of greater dimensions. Opposite the study follows the dining room, adorned with themes of courtly love. Since the kitchen in Neuschwanstein is situated three stories below the dining room, {{it was impossible to}} install a wishing table (dining table disappearing by means of a mechanism) as at Linderhof Palace and Herrenchiemsee. Instead, the dining room was connected with the kitchen by means of a service lift.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{conductance}} of graphene nanoribbons with long-range disorder. Due {{to the absence}} of intervalley scattering from the disorder potential, time-reversal symmetry (TRS) can be effectively broken even without a magnetic field, {{depending on the type of}} ribbon edge. Even though <b>armchair</b> edges generally mix valleys, we show that metallic <b>armchair</b> nanoribbons possess a hidden pseudovalley structure and effectively broken TRS. In contrast, semiconducting <b>armchair</b> nanoribbons inevitably mix valleys and restore TRS. As a result, in strong disorder metallic <b>armchair</b> ribbons exhibit a perfectly conducting channel, but semiconducting <b>armchair</b> ribbons ordinary localization. TRS is also effectively broken in zigzag nanoribbons in the absence of valley mixing. However, we show that intervalley scattering in zigzag ribbons is significantly enhanced and TRS is restored even for smooth disorder, if the Fermi energy is smaller than the potential amplitude. The symmetry properties of disordered nanoribbons are also reflected in their conductance in the diffusive regime. In particular, we find suppression of weak localization and an enhancement of conductance fluctuations in metallic <b>armchair</b> and zigzag ribbons without valley mixing. In contrast, semiconducting <b>armchair</b> and zigzag ribbons with valley mixing exhibit weak localization behavior. Comment: 11 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
