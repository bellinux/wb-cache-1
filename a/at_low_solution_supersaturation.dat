40|$|Renal stone {{disease is}} not only a concern on earth but could conceivably pose as a serious risk to the astronauts health and safety in Space. In this paper, a {{combined}} transport-kinetics model for growth of calcium oxalate crystals is presented. The model is used to parametrically investigate the growth of renal calculi in urine with a focus on the coupled effects of transport and surface reaction on the ionic concentrations at the surface of the crystal and their impact on the resulting growth rates. It is shown that under nominal conditions of <b>low</b> <b>solution</b> <b>supersaturation</b> and <b>low</b> Damkohler number that typically exist on Earth, the surface concentrations of calcium and oxalate approach their bulk solution values in the urine and the growth rate is most likely limited by the surface reaction kinetics. But for higher <b>solution</b> <b>supersaturations</b> and larger Damkohler numbers that may be prevalent in the microgravity environment of Space, the calcium and oxalate surface concentrations tend to shift more towards their equilibrium or saturation values and thus the growth process may be limited by the transport through the medium. Furthermore, parametric numerical studies suggest that changes to the renal biochemistry of astronauts due in space may promote development of renal calculi during long duration space expeditions...|$|R

Oxygen can be extracted from lunar regolith, and water contaminated with hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids is produced as an intermediate in this process.

The effect of membrane thickness, product stream flow rate, and acid solution temperature and concentration on water flux, acid rejection, and water and acid activity were studied. The conditions that maximized water transport and acid rejection while minimizing resource usage were determined by calculating a figure of merit. Water permeation is highest at high solution temperature and product stream flow rate across thin membranes, while chloride and fluoride permeation are <b>lowest</b> <b>at</b> <b>low</b> acid <b>solution</b> temperature and concentration across thin membranes.

30|$|<b>At</b> <b>low</b> <b>solution</b> pH, the {{functionalities}} onto PANI-NCC are protonated {{and formed}} positive surface charge (NH+). This induces the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged NH+ {{and the free}} anionic Cr(VI). Moreover, when the solution pH increases up to 6.5, the functionalities onto PANI-NCC are deprotonated forming negative charge surface (:NH 2) and capable to sorb cationic Cr(III) through electrostatic attraction. This {{can be explained by}} the different positions of the point of zero charge (PZC) of PANI-NCC. The pH at PZC (pHPZC) defines the Coulombic interactions between the surface of functionalized nanomaterials and chromium species. Since the surface of PANI-NCC is positively charged at pH of solution is lower than pH PZC (pH of point of zero charge of PANI-NCC) and it becomes negatively charged when pH of solution is greater than pH PZC (Chingombe et al. 2005; Saleh and Gupta 2012 a; Dichiara et al. 2015). This is the reason maximum uptake of cationic Cr(III) at basic pH and anionic Cr(VI) at acidic pH. These results are consistent with previous studies reporting the sorption of metal ions (Mittal et al. 2010 b; Anirudhan and Rejeena 2012; Hokkanen et al. 2013; Gupta et al. 2013). Therefore, PANI-NCC has an ability to sorb both cationic and anionic metals by changing the pH conditions.|$|R

Hydraulic conductivities for five soils were reduced 60 to 95 percent for input solutions having maximum sodium adsorption ratios (SAR) of 25.

Hydraulic conductivity changes from increases in solution SAR were described mathematically using two empirically determined parameters that appear unique for each soil at a constant concentration. The parameters found for this study, plus those found from data of previous studies, were compared using multiple regression analysis to determine the most significant soil properties in predicting conductivity changes. Soil texture has the greatest influence on the parameters. An equation derived by combining data from eleven alkaline soils was selected as best for predicting hydraulic conductivities resulting from SAR changes.

One intended {{goal of this}} scheme is to facilitate the delivery of peptide drugs into target cells. Here, we investigate whether stapled peptides are intrinsically membrane permeable, by performing a case study on a stapled 12 -mer peptide named NYAD- 1. We found that the native peptide CAI (an HIV- 1 inhibitor) does not bind to lipid bilayers, however NYAD- 1 indeed permeates through lipid bilayers even <b>at</b> <b>low</b> <b>solution</b> concentrations. To understand {{the reason for the}} membrane permeability, we investigated the physical properties of NYAD- 1 as a function of bound peptide/lipid molar ratio P/L.

The membrane thinning reaches its maximum at P/L ∼ 1 / 15 – 1 / 12 in DOPC bilayers. Additional bound peptides have little thinning effect and their helical axes are normal to the plane of bilayers. Thus, the stapled peptide has a membrane interaction behavior similar to helical antimicrobial peptides, such as magainin and melittin.

Growth velocities thus determined as a function of <b>solution</b> <b>supersaturation</b> were further interpreted using established deterministic models. From analyses of crystal-growth velocities, {{it was found that the}} mode of crystal growth varies with respect to increasing <b>solution</b> <b>supersaturation,</b> possibly owing to kinetic roughening.

40|$|The {{adsorption}} of the amphiphilic {{diblock copolymer}} poly(2 -(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate-block-methyl methacrylate) (DMA-MMA) at the mica/solution interface has been studied, over {{a range of}} solution pH values, using in situ atomic force microscopy. In contrast to the adsorption of the homopolymer poly(2 -(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate (DMA), which exhibited a featureless adsorbed layer, adsorbed layers of the DMA-MMA copolymer exhibited lateral structure at all pH values studied. <b>At</b> <b>low</b> <b>solution</b> pH, images of the adsorbed layer reveal discrete domelike structures, separated by regions with no lateral features. Force-distance data recorded between these domes indicate adsorption {{in the form of}} positively charged material. It is proposed that the adsorbed layer forms via the adsorption of DMA-MMA micelles directly to the mica surface, followed by relaxation of the DMA chains to the surface. This relaxation is driven by electrostatics and results in an adsorbed layer that is essentially a layer of DMA chains with the MMA cores protruding as domes at the sites of the original micelle adsorption. The domes are evident over the entire surface, although arranged in a disordered manner. The distance between the domes is seen to decrease as the pH of the adsorbing copolymer solution is increased from 4 to 7, due to the increased number of negatively charged adsorption sites on the mica surface. Adsorption of charged latex particles shows that objects without molecular freedom adsorb in a close-packed manner. Close packing of adsorbed units is also observed when the DMA-MMA micelles are adsorbed from a solution at natural pH (pH 8. 3), where the relaxation of the coronal DMA chains is electrostatically hindered...|$|R
40|$|Ultrafine calcium {{carbonate}} {{is a widely}} used cheap additive. The research is conducted in <b>low</b> degree <b>supersaturation</b> <b>solution</b> in order to study the polymorphic phases’ change and its factors of the {{calcium carbonate}} precipitate in the ammonification-carbonization process of the solution with calcium. Fine particles of calcium carbonate {{are made in the}} solution containing 0. 015 [*]mol/L of Ca 2 +. Over 98 % of the calcium carbonate precipitate without ammonification resembles the morphology of calcite, while the introduction of ammonia can benefit the formation of vaterite. It was inferred that the main cause should be serious partial oversaturation or steric effects. Ammonia also helps to form the twin spherical calcium carbonate. However, particles formed in the process of ammonification-carbonization in <b>solution</b> with <b>low</b> concentration degree of calcium are not even with a scale of the particle diameter from 5 to 12 [*]μm. Inorganic salts, alcohol, or organic acid salts have significant controlling effect on the particle diameter of calcium carbonate and can help to decrease the particle diameter to about 3 [*]μm. Anionic surfactants can prevent the conglobation of calcium carbonate particles and shrink its diameter to 500 [*]nm– 1 [*]μm...|$|R
