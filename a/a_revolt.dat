50|$|Internet-based {{activism}} {{is sometimes}} called <b>a</b> user <b>revolt</b> when website users protest {{the terms of a}} website while using that website for other purposes. A distinction between <b>a</b> user <b>revolt</b> and Internet-based activism could be that in <b>a</b> user <b>revolt,</b> <b>an</b> objective of the protest is to revolt against the website itself. In Internet-based activism, the primary goal of the protest is something other than reforming a website, although websites which create barriers to the larger protest may incidentally experience <b>a</b> user <b>revolt</b> for participating in the larger conflict. An example of a situation in which Internet activism includes <b>a</b> user <b>revolt</b> might be when users wish to engage in prohibited political discussion, but a government compels the website host to censor those discussions. The core conflict in this case is between users and the government, and not that the website itself as a communication medium. However, when the website as a communication medium chooses to create barriers to communication for users, then users of the website organize <b>a</b> user <b>revolt</b> even when the primary objective is something other than a website protest.|$|R
