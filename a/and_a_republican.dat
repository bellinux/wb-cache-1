5|$|A {{conservative}} Washington D.C. think tank, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> {{member of}} Congress, among others, {{have claimed that}} Gore has a conflict-of-interest for advocating for taxpayer subsidies of green-energy technologies {{in which he has}} a personal investment. Additionally, he has been criticized for his above-average energy consumption in using private jets, and in owning multiple, very large homes, one of which was reported in 2007 as using high amounts of electricity. Gore's spokesperson responded by stating that the Gores use renewable energy which is more expensive than regular energy and that the Tennessee house in question has been retrofitted to make it more energy-efficient.|$|E

Fremont. However, Behan had greater political experience and influence in Prescott.|$|E
5|$|McKinley campaigned widely for Republicans in the 1894 midterm congressional elections; many party {{candidates}} in districts where he spoke were successful. His political efforts in Ohio were rewarded {{with the election}} in November 1895 of a Republican successor as governor, Asa Bushnell, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> legislature that elected Foraker to the Senate. McKinley supported Foraker for Senate and Bushnell (who was of Foraker's faction) for governor; in return, the new senator-elect agreed to back McKinley's presidential ambitions. With party peace in Ohio assured, McKinley turned to the national arena.|$|E

25|$|In 1990, Weld {{announced}} his candidacy for Governor of Massachusetts, {{to replace the}} out-going Michael Dukakis. Although Republicans made up under 14% of the Massachusetts electorate <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> had not won the gubernatorial election since 1970, Weld's liberal stances on social issues made him a viable candidate for office in the heavily Democratic state. At the state Republican convention, party officials backed Steven Pierce over Weld, and initial polling had Pierce ahead by 25 percentage points. Weld gained enough support to force a primary, and in an upset election, Weld won the Republican nomination over Pierce by a 60–40 margin.|$|E
25|$|Watson was a Democrat, and {{was first}} elected to the State House in 1884, but his {{eligibility}} was challenged due his previous residence in Philadelphia.

Then {{he was elected to}} the State Senate and served in the 1893/94 session and the 1895/96 session, when he was the Speaker. The 1894 elections, however, resulted in a Republican State House <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> Governor. Regardless, the State Senate kept its Democratic majority, and when GovernorJoshua H. Marvil died, the Speaker of the State Senate succeeded him. Watson assumed the office of Governor of Delaware and served from April 8, 1895 until January 19, 1897.|$|E

25|$|Taylor {{claimed that}} he “went West” after he left La Crosse and before he {{appeared}} in Oskaloosa, Iowa in January 1891. The record is silent concerning his activities during these missing three years. By the time he surfaced in Iowa, Taylor had affiliated with the Republican Party. He arrived in Iowa as a community organizer <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> Party promoter. His focus changed from “labor” to “race” {{in a time when}} the nation was increasing focusing on the issues of race and the “Negro Problem.” In this two-decade period, Taylor owned and operated a newspaper (the Negro Solicitor) and a farm, served two terms as a local Justice of the Peace (judge), transitioned from Republican to Democrat to Independent and back to Democrat, and was a policeman.

25|$|Their eight {{children}} included James S. Naudain M.D. who married Ann Elizabeth Blackiston, both dying young, Andrew S. Naudain who studied {{law in the}} office of John M.

Naudain who married Hugh Alexander and lived in Chicago, and Mary H. Naudain who married William N. Hamilton M.D, who had attended school in Dublin, London and Jefferson College in Philadelphia.

25|$|Some slaveholders made {{a profit}} by selling surplus slaves to traders for {{transport}} {{to the markets}} of the Deep South, where the demand was still high for field hands on cotton plantations. In contrast to the near-unanimity of voters in the seven cotton states in the lower South, which held {{the highest number of}} slaves, the border slave states were bitterly divided about secession and were not eager to leave the Union. Border Unionists hoped that a compromise would be reached, and they assumed that Lincoln would not send troops to attack the South. Border secessionists paid less attention to the slavery issue in 1861, since their states' economies were based more on trade with the North than on cotton. Their main concern in 1861 was federal coercion; some residents viewed Lincoln's call to arms as a repudiation of the American traditions of states' rights, democracy, liberty, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>republican</b> form of government. Secessionists insisted that Washington had usurped illegitimate powers in defiance of the Constitution, and thereby had lost its legitimacy. After Lincoln issued a call for troops, Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas, and North Carolina promptly seceded and joined the Confederacy. A secession movement began in western Virginia, where most farmers were yeomen and not slaveholders, to break away and remain in the Union.|$|E

He said that he was a libertarian philosophically, but a member of the U.S. Republican Party for the sake of [...] "expediency" [...] ("I am a libertarian with a small 'l' <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> with a capital 'R.' And I am a Republican with a capital 'R' on grounds of expediency, not on principle.") But, he said, [...] "I think the term classical liberal is also equally applicable.
