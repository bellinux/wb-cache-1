500|$|In January 1945, McGovern used R time to {{see every}} sight that he could in Rome, and to {{participate}} in an audience with the Pope. Bad weather prevented many missions from being carried out during the winter, and during such downtime McGovern spent much time reading and discussing how the war had come about. He resolved that if he survived it, he would become a history professor. In February, McGovern was promoted to First Lieutenant. On March 14, McGovern had an incident over Austria in which he accidentally bombed a family farmhouse when a jammed bomb inadvertently released above the structure and destroyed it, an event which haunted McGovern. (Four decades later, after a McGovern public appearance in that country, the owner of the farm approached the media to let the Senator know that he was the victim of that incident but that no one had been hurt and the farmer felt that it had been worth the price if that event helped achieve the defeat of Nazi Germany in some small way. McGovern was greatly relieved.) On returning to base from the flight, McGovern was told his first child Ann had been born four days earlier. April 25 saw McGovern's 35thmission, which marked fulfillment of the Fifteenth Air Force's requirement for a combat tour, against heavily defended Linz. The sky turned black and red with flak – McGovern later said [...] "Hell can't be <b>any</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> that" [...] – and the Dakota Queen was hit multiple times, resulting in 110holes in its fuselage and wings and an inoperative hydraulic system. McGovern's waist gunner was injured, and his flight engineer was so unnerved by his experience that he would subsequently be hospitalized with battle fatigue, but McGovern managed to bring back the plane safely with the assistance of an improvised landing technique.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Washington Post, [...] "Officials {{from the}} U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Saturday [...] that they {{assessed}} the {{damage from the}} [...] quake in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and found {{that many of the}} roads aren't <b>any</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> they were before because they've always been in poor condition." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1998 in the UK, a {{parliamentary}} working group chaired by MP Roger Gale studied living conditions {{and treatment of}} animals in UK circuses. All {{members of this group}} agreed that a change in the law was needed to protect circus animals. Gale told the BBC, [...] "It's undignified and the conditions under which they are kept are woefully inadequate—the cages are too small, the environments they live in are not suitable and many of us believe {{the time has come for}} that practice to end." [...] The group reported concerns about boredom and stress, and noted that an independent study by a member of the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit at Oxford University [...] "found no evidence that circuses contribute to education or conservation." [...] However, in 2007, a different working group under the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, having reviewed information from experts representing both the circus industry and animal welfare, found an absence of [...] "scientific evidence sufficient to demonstrate that travelling circuses are not compatible with meeting the welfare needs of any type of non-domesticated animal presently being used in the United Kingdom." [...] According to that group's report, published in October 2007, [...] "there appears to be little evidence to demonstrate that the welfare of animals kept in travelling circuses is any better or <b>any</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> that of animals kept in other captive environments." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Hold your tongue," [...] said Peter in {{a fierce}} whisper. [...] "You oughter have more sense than to say such things to the girls. They don't want to be <b>any</b> <b>worse</b> scared <b>than</b> they are." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You can't be <b>any</b> <b>worse</b> off <b>than</b> I am," [...] {{my partner}} replied, {{and then we}} both laughed softly. An {{acknowledgment}} of our timorousness seemed to hearten us, and we worked the paddles in a more whole-souled fashion.|$|R

Of criminals--To me, any judge, or any juror, is equally criminal--and any [...] reputable person is also--and the President is also.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, let's be off," [...] {{continued}} the Ork, after sticking its {{head into the}} black hole and sniffing once or twice. [...] "The air seems fresh and sweet, and it can't lead us to <b>any</b> <b>worse</b> place <b>than</b> this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{would n't}} mind," [...] said the lamb again; [...] "I shall grow more wool by wintertime, and I 'm sure I {{do n't look}} <b>any</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> you do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Luigi," [...] I protested, [...] "be careful how {{you turn}} away custom. Mr. Parker is, I should think, no better or <b>any</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> {{a great many}} of your clients." ...|$|E
6000|$|... --Well, says J. J., if they're <b>any</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> those Belgians in the Congo Free State {{they must}} be bad. Did you read that report by a man what's this his name is? ...|$|E

50|$|After the Restoration St John {{published}} {{an account of}} his past conduct (The Case of Oliver St John, 1660), and this apologia enabled him to escape <b>any</b> <b>worse</b> retribution <b>than</b> exclusion from public office.

6000|$|... "Then they won't find us together," [...] {{announced}} Bradley decisively. [...] "You {{stay right}} here--you won't be <b>any</b> <b>worse</b> off <b>than</b> before I came--and I'll {{get as far}} as I can and account for {{as many of the}} beggars as possible before they get me. Good-bye! You're a mighty decent little girl. I wish that I might have helped you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't know if that's <b>any</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> sitting to {{a drunken}} beast in a studio. You haven't been sober for three weeks. You've been soaking the whole time; {{and yet you}} pretend you're better than me!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if {{he speaks}} the truth, which is doubtful, {{he does not}} seem to be <b>any</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> other men, though that is saying little enough. Is he sound in wind and limb, and what {{illnesses}} has he had?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's easy enough. I'll {{tell you}} what to do. Anyhow, you {{probably}} won't steer <b>any</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> I row, so let's go and get a boat out, and I'll try and think of a few more words of wisdom for your benefit.' ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{presented}} a most deplorable appearance {{when he returned}} home one morning. His clothes were in tatters, the shoes literally hanging from his feet, and the pangs of hunger printed on his face. Imprisonment was a far less severe punishment than starvation, and as he said, [...] "the judge couldn't give him <b>any</b> sentence <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> sneaking around the mountains without food or shelter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "America," [...] she said, after a moment's pause, [...] "is the {{one country}} I detest. We are only there very seldom--when Mr. Watson's {{business}} demands it. You could not seek for information from <b>any</b> one <b>worse</b> informed <b>than</b> I am." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{sight of}} those great baskets of good fare was appetising, {{and the company}} soon {{collected}} on the shady turf, where Richard made himself extremely useful, and the feast was spread without <b>any</b> <b>worse</b> mishap <b>than</b> Nipen's running away with half a chicken, {{of which he was}} robbed, as Tom reported, by a surly-looking dog that watched in the outskirts of the camp, and caused Tom to return nearly as fast as the poor little white marauder.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. And {{his rifle}} work isn't <b>any</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> mine," [...] {{answered}} Andy. [...] "Now, I'll promise {{to make a}} lot of bull's-eyes for you if you'll let me use a good-sized shotgun or a blunderbuss," [...] and at this there was a snicker.|$|E
6000|$|The fingers relaxed their hold {{upon that}} {{gathering}} up of his coat-sleeve. [...] "I won't be explained, and I {{have told her}} so. If I choose to act myself, and show out my real thoughts and feelings, how is it <b>any</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> if I acted somebody else!" ...|$|E
6000|$|You {{think you}} couldn't {{possibly}} feel <b>any</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> you do right now, but you could. Many a time I {{have had to}} go hungry longer than this. After we have rested awhile we will go over to the Old Pasture. Perhaps we will have better luck there." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{laws of the}} Cook Islands Federation {{were made}} by the local parliament, however they had to receive {{approval}} from a Resident from Britain. In 1899, the Parliament of Cook Islands ruled that the high court of the Cook Islands Federation could not give <b>any</b> punishment <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> those outlined by the Criminal Code Act of 1893, and The Summary Jurisdiction Act of 1894, which were both laws of New Zealand, and that both acts of New Zealand were to be adopted entirely.|$|R
6000|$|... "Would {{you make}} a child of me, Alice?" [...] said Sir Henry. [...] "Why, know you not that I can look upon a viper, or a toad, or a bunch of engendering adders, without <b>any</b> <b>worse</b> feeling <b>than</b> a little disgust? and though a roundhead, and {{especially}} a red-coat, are in my opinion more poisonous than vipers, more loathsome than toads, more hateful than knotted adders, yet can I overcome my nature so far, that should one of them appear at this moment, thyself should see how civilly I would entreat him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That has {{certainly}} done me {{a world of}} good," [...] the farmer said when he had dressed himself. [...] "I don't say the stiffness has all gone, but I certainly don't feel <b>any</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> I did when I got to your camp. I should never have thought of it myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'At last said De Aquila: [...] "I am {{too old to}} judge, or {{to trust}} any man. I do not covet thy lands, as thou hast coveted mine; and whether thou art any better or <b>any</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> any other black Angevin thief, it is for thy King to find out. Therefore, go back to thy King, Fulke." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was hard}} not to be allowed to help--it was hard to wait! When the heart was suffering, it was frightful! He turned and, looking furtively about him, lighted a cigar. Yes, it came to every one--at some time or other; and what was it, that death they talked of? Was it <b>any</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> life? That frightful jumble people made for themselves! Poor Nicholas! After all, it was he that had the luck! ...|$|E
60|$|The nurse {{consented to}} follow these suggestions, the more readily as they offered her {{the means of}} {{securing}} herself against <b>any</b> <b>worse</b> consequences <b>than</b> {{the loss of her}} place, by remaining in the Asylum, and so maintaining the appearance of innocence, at least. She at once returned to the house, and Miss Halcombe lost no time in taking her sister back with her to London. They caught the afternoon train to Carlisle the same afternoon, and arrived at Limmeridge, without accident or difficulty of any kind, that night.|$|R
25|$|A uniform {{carbon tax}} {{would not be}} Pareto {{efficient}} unless lump sum transfers were made between countries. Pareto efficiency requires that the carbon tax would not make <b>any</b> countries <b>worse</b> off <b>than</b> they would be without the tax (Chichilnisky and Heal, 1994, p.445; Tol, 2001, p.72). Also, at least one country {{would need to be}} better off.|$|R
50|$|Slovenes {{were closer}} to Croats {{in terms of}} {{religion}} and culture. In particular, they {{knew that they were}} too small in numbers to form a nation of their own and {{there was no reason to}} suppose a Croat-dominated Yugoslavia would be <b>any</b> better or <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> a Serb-dominated one. For the most part, they went along with the general political flow and were not a significant source of problems.|$|R
