25|$|An {{audiometer}} is {{a machine}} used for evaluating hearing loss. Audiometers are standard equipment at ENT clinics and in <b>audiology</b> centers. They usually consist of an embedded hardware unit {{connected to a}} pair of headphones and a feedback button, sometimes controlled by a standard PC. The invention of this machine is generally credited to Dr. Harvey Fletcher of Brigham Young University who invented the first audiometer in 1922.|$|E

25|$|Craniofacial {{anomalies}} - Includes craniosynostosis, plagiocephaly, and syndromes {{associated with}} these defects. In cases of craniosynostosis where surgical intervention is necessary, the involvement {{of a team of}} multi-disciplinary professionals is of utmost importance. Team members often come from departments of plastic surgery, oral and maxillofacial surgery, neurosurgery, <b>audiology,</b> dentistry, orthodontics, and speech and language pathology. These professionals often assist not only in operational procedures, but in developing coordinated care plans for the child throughout their life.|$|E

The findings were published in the Journal of Criminal Justice Education.|$|E
25|$|Another {{controversy}} {{concerns the}} fact that most traditional tests of APD use verbal materials. The British Society of <b>Audiology</b> has embraced Moore's (2006) recommendation that tests for APD should assess processing of non-speech sounds. The concern is that if verbal materials are used to test for APD, then children may fail because of limited language ability. An analogy may be drawn with trying to listen to sounds in a foreign language. It is much harder to distinguish between sounds or to remember a sequence of words in a language you do not know well: the problem is not an auditory one, but rather due to lack of expertise in the language.|$|E

2500|$|Depending {{on how it}} is defined, APD may {{share common}} {{symptoms}} with ADD/ADHD, specific language impairment, Asperger syndrome {{and other forms of}} autism. A review showed substantial evidence for atypical processing of auditory information in children with autism. Dawes and Bishop noted how specialists in <b>audiology</b> and speech-language pathology often adopted different approaches to child assessment, and they concluded their review as follows: [...] "We regard it as crucial that these different professional groups work together in carrying out assessment, treatment and management of children and undertaking cross-disciplinary research." [...] In practice, this seems rare.|$|E

2500|$|APD {{has been}} defined anatomically {{in terms of the}} {{integrity}} of the auditory areas of the nervous system. However, children with symptoms of APD typically have no evidence of neurological disease and the diagnosis is {{made on the basis of}} performance on behavioral auditory tests. Auditory processing is [...] "what we do with what we hear", and in APD there is a mismatch between peripheral hearing ability (which is typically normal) and ability to interpret or discriminate sounds. Thus in those with no signs of neurological impairment, APD is diagnosed on the basis of auditory tests. There is, however, no consensus as to which tests should be used for diagnosis, as evidenced by the succession of task force reports that have appeared in recent years. The first of these occurred in 1996. This was followed by a conference organized by the American Academy of <b>Audiology.</b> Experts attempting to define diagnostic criteria have to grapple with the problem that a child may do poorly on an auditory test for reasons other than poor auditory perception: for instance, failure could be due to inattention, difficulty in coping with task demands, or limited language ability. In an attempt to rule out at least some of these factors, the American Academy of <b>Audiology</b> conference explicitly advocated that for APD to be diagnosed, the child must have a modality-specific problem, i.e. affecting auditory but not visual processing. However, an ASHA committee subsequently rejected modality-specificity as a defining characteristic of auditory processing disorders.|$|E
