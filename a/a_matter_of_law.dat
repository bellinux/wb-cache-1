5|$|On July 7, 2009, Judge Naves {{found that}} the {{defendants}} (university) were entitled to quasi-judicial immunity as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> vacated the jury verdict and determined that the University did not owe Churchill any financial compensation. Naves denied Churchill's request for reinstatement at CU.|$|E
5|$|I {{am willing}} to hold that, as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> a statute like § 93(b), which prohibits a union from {{collecting}} dues from its members, impairs the union's ability to represent those members {{to such an extent}} that it infringes on their § 7 right to bargain through the representative of their choice.|$|E
5|$|The {{court also}} found the {{affidavit}} of Parker to be insufficient as a factual matter {{to comply with the}} terms of the statute. However, even if the district attorney had brought the action and the affidavit had been sufficient, the Supreme Court still would have denied mandamus as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{crime is}} often linked with {{attempts}} to extort {{money from the}} manufacturer, {{and in many cases}} no contamination to a product ever takes place. Fraud is sometimes handled as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> civil <b>law,</b> but actual modification of products is almost always <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> criminal <b>law.</b>|$|R

5|$|Contact with {{ammunition}} is {{a source}} of lead exposure. As of 2013, lead-based ammunition production is the second largest annual use of lead in the US, accounting for over 60,000 metric tons consumed in 2012, second only to the manufacture of storage batteries. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) can not regulate cartridges and shells, as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> Lead birdshot is banned in some areas, but this is primarily {{for the benefit of the}} birds and their predators, rather than humans. Non-lead alternatives include steel, tungsten-nickel-iron, bismuth-tin, and tungsten-polymer.|$|E

25|$|Also {{relatively}} non-controversial is {{the ability}} of a state to try its own nationals for crimes committed abroad. France and some other nations will refuse to extradite their own citizens as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> but will instead try them on their own territory for crimes committed abroad.|$|E

25|$|As <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> the Governor-General {{is not in}} {{the same}} {{constitutional}} position as the Sovereign; the office itself does not independently possess any powers of the Royal Prerogative. If present in New Zealand, the monarch may exercise her powers personally. Furthermore, some powers, such as the approval of a new Royal Honour, may be exercised by the monarch alone.|$|E
25|$|Opas {{decided to}} appeal against the murder verdict. The appeal {{was to the}} Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal, a bench {{consisting}} of three judges of the Supreme Court. The basis of the appeal was that the verdict was against {{the weight of the}} evidence. He argued that as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> that the inherent inconsistencies and improbabilities and even impossibilities in the evidence.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, Home Depot appealed {{against the}} {{decision}} to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, challenging the district court's denial of its renewed motion for judgment as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> {{on the issues of}} infringement, willfulness, and damages. They also challenged the district court's claim construction, inequitable conduct, and attorney fees determinations. The appellate court found no inequitable conduct and insufficiently egregious misconduct on the part of Powell's attorney.|$|E

25|$|The final Reading {{takes the}} same format as the First and Second Readings — a two-hour debate with MPs making ten-minute speeches. The speeches once again {{refer to the}} bill in general terms, and {{represent}} the final chance for debate. A final vote is taken. If a bill passes its third reading, it is {{passed on to the}} Governor-General, who may (assuming constitutional conventions are followed) give it Royal Assent as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> It then becomes law.|$|E
25|$|Roman law {{recognized}} rape as a {{crime in}} which the victim bore no guilt and a capital crime. The rape of a woman was considered an attack on her family and father's honour, and rape victims were shamed for allowing the bad name in her father's honour. As <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> rape could be committed only against a citizen in good standing. The rape of a slave could be prosecuted only as damage to her owner's property.|$|E
25|$|To have standing, plaintiffs {{must prove}} that the {{surviving}} tribal organization is the successor in interest to the historical tribe. Mashpee Tribe v. New Seabury Corp. (1979) {{is an example of}} a claim defeated by disproving this element. The First Circuit has also held that the cause of action under the Nonintercourse Act accrues only to tribes, not individuals; moreover, where a jury finds against tribal status, non-federally-recognized tribes are not entitled to reverse that holding as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E

25|$|In Static Control Components, Inc. v. Lexmark Int’l, Inc., 615 F.Supp.2d 575 (E.D.

The court said that the Supreme Court’s Quanta decision “has changed the landscape of the doctrine of patent exhaustion generally, and specifically” required a reversal of the judgment, so that SCCI was not liable to Lexmark for patent infringement.|$|E
25|$|John Connolly did not appear. His {{brother and}} Russell {{were found guilty}} on all five counts. Both raised the {{entrapment}} defense, arguing that while they would have made and sold meth regardless of Shapiro's involvement, his supplying of an ingredient that, while legal, was difficult to get due to the bureau's own efforts to dissuade chemical companies from selling it and requiring that those who did sell only to buyers with a valid manufacturer's license, constituted entrapment as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E
25|$|In some courts, {{violations}} of the stay are treated as void ab initio as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> although the court may annul the stay {{to give effect to}} otherwise void acts. Other courts treat violations as voidable (not necessarily void ab initio). Any violation of the stay may give rise to damages being assessed against the violating party. Non-willful {{violations of}} the stay are often excused without penalty, but willful violators are liable for punitive damages and may also be found to be in contempt of court.|$|E

25|$|States cannot {{transfer}} {{rights over}} {{something they do}} not own. In the case of Kelantan and any other Peninsular Malaysian state, the Deed should have been worded to refer only to onshore petroleum. Unfortunately for Kelantan, the matter cannot end with the two agreements. There is a supreme Constitution in Malaysia with a federal-state division of legislative and financial powers. The constitutional allocation cannot be altered except by constitutionally permitted procedures and amendments. Even mutual agreements cannot override the constitutional scheme of things because jurisdiction is <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> and not of consent or acquiescence.|$|E
25|$|In September, Proposition 8 proponents filed {{a motion}} for summary judgment. Running more than 100 pages, the motion {{asked the court to}} rule that Proposition 8 did not offend the U.S. Constitution without the need to find facts at a trial. The motion {{asserted}} that Baker v. Nelson foreclosed any further review by the court. Failing that, the motion argued that all of the couples' claims failed as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> After a two-hour hearing on October 13, Walker denied the motion. He noted that the Supreme Court doctrine on sexual orientation and gender discrimination had changed since 1972. Resolving the amendment's validity, Walker noted, required hearing testimony at trial.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} half of {{the country}} had been colonised in 1884 by the United Kingdom as British New Guinea. With the Papua Act 1905, the UK transferred this territory to the newly formed Commonwealth of Australia, which took on its administration. Additionally, from 1905, British New Guinea was renamed as the Territory of Papua. In contrast to establishing an Australian mandate in former German New Guinea, the League of Nations determined that Papua was an External Territory of the Australian Commonwealth; as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> it remained a British possession. The difference in legal status meant that until 1949, Papua and New Guinea had entirely separate administrations, both controlled by Australia. These conditions contributed to the complexity of organising the country's post-independence legal system.|$|E
