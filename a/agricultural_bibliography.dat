This analysis included 246 articles that constitute the collection from volume 1 to 19, 33 issues in total, between years 1985 and 2001. Venezuelan <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Bibliography</b> database was used as source of data, and an ad hoc procedure. There were determined several supply and demand indicators that characterize the journal, showing the first indicators about its impact on research and academic sectors in the country. Results showed that the journal had favorable bibliometric indicators; a growth index of 3. 22 in average, a growing number of authors and institutions, as well as typical values of productivity indicators for domestic journals. Presence in internet is discussed in relation to the access of electronically available journals. Such information provides valuable indicators in the decision making process to help the improvement of the journal positioning and a more solid scientific status...|$|E

Thanks to the project entitled: „The expansion and conversion of the bibliographical AGRO database into the bibliographical - abstract database using the YADDA software” {{it is possible to}} increase the attractiveness and the information capability of AGRO database for the users. The abstracts and the annex bibliography are added to the database records. In order to increase the information abilities of the database and to propagate the Polish science achievents abroad, the keywords in Polish records are translated into English. During the implementation of the project over 130 new index titles of the magazines were included. Moreover, contracts with editors were signed, which enabled to put the whole texts in the database. At present there are over 35 titles of the magazines which come under this procedure. In terms of quantity, the indexed articles are predicted to increase to about 500. 000 record...|$|E
40|$|The International Association of Agricultural Librarians and Documentalists (IAALD) has {{understood}} {{since its}} creation (in 1955) that {{the access to}} the primary documents and namely for the non-conventional ones is essetial in agriculture for everyone in all countries all over the world, and that the 2500 agricultural libraries (in 1980) need an internationally supported structure {{in order to promote}} their cooperation. AGLINET (AGricultural LIbrary NETwork) was crete in November 1971, under the coordination of David Lubin library of the FAO. The principle of the system is the reciprocal non commercial availability of catalogs and the photocopy supplying or lending services. In the same period the need for an agricultural bibliographic database, accessible in the developing countries is discussed by IAALD conference. AGRIS is create in 1974 under FAO coordination. Its principle is the participation of a great nomber of countries by putting into the database the bibliographic descriptions of the conventional, but also non-conventional literature issued on their own territory. The national and international centres are responsible for collecting and making available the national and international output of grey literature. Since the beginning of AGRIS a special tag pointing non conventional documents is create (the bibliographic indicator V) and a field in the bibliographic description receives the complete address of availability. The reciprocal convention which relies all AGRIS participants to provide each other the primary documents hold by the country of origin reinforces the work of AGLINET. The second common AGLINETcatalogue of periodicals (1985) comprised the 3700 titles most frequently cited in AGRIS, with their location in the AGLINET libraries. Participation to AGRIS has permitted the developing countries to became conscians of the importance of their own grey litterature and also create their own national <b>agricultural</b> <b>bibliography.</b> From 1975 to now, near 400 000 descriptions of grey documents are present in AGRIS database (20 per cent of all the descriptions). An analysis of the document types, country of origin, annaual increase and their occurrence in CAB is given. Includes : Conference preprint, Pratt student commentaryXAInternationa...|$|E

40|$|Librarians and {{trainers}} {{working together}} in Africa If {{everyone involved in}} agricultural development {{had access to the}} right information, at the right time and in the right place, many problems in this field could be resolved overnight. In an effort to get closer to this ideal, CTA and IFLA (International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions) brought together 15 reference librarians, agronomists, trainers and publishers based in anglophone Africa for a workshop from June 15 - 26, 1987 in Lilongwe, Malawi. This workshop was held to complement one for francophone participants (held in December 1986 in Dakar) and saw ten countries represented: Botswana, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia. The training team consisted of both ACP and European specialists in this field including S. Keena of IFD; W. Robert, J. Kinney, P. Wortley and M. Kinch. The major agricultural databases and principal suppliers of background information were represented by E. Lebowitz of AGRIS, J. Loder of CABI, K. Russel of the U. S. NAL, D. Hall of IFIS and D. Wood of the British Library Document Supply Centre. Identifying user needs This meeting not only enabled the participants to better appreciate analytical methodologies and identify user needs, but also increased their familiarity with primary and secondary information sources dealing with tropical agriculture. Emphasis was placed on the means of improving the publication, distribution and acquisition of documents as well as inter-library loans. The objective is to ensure the availability and accessibility of documentation through the supply of photocopies or microfilm. The potential of CD-ROM (Compact Disc - Read Only Memory; see Spore 9) was also covered. This new technology promises considerable advances for improving access to information. Furthermore, it appears to be quite appropriate for developing countries as it is sturdy, relatively inexpensive, easy to use and does not depend on unreliable telecommunication systems. The workshop also considered the role librarians can play as intermediaries between producers and consumers of information, an aspect which is unfortunately often underestimated. The approach taken by the workshop itself was to encourage the sharing of the practical experiences {{of the participants in the}} use of resources. The presentation of national reports and the ensuing discussion enabled the identification of a certain number of major problems that were subsequently treated in detail. This session had little in common with an academic course: the theoretical presentations were only used to introduce the practical work Concrete results Among other things, this part of the workshop dealt with the use of bibliographies, abstracts and directories. A concrete result was the compilation of several guides to inforrnation sources notably a 'List of agricultural periodicals in Africa', a 'Directory of research centres, universities and rural development departments in Africa' and a 'Bibliography of <b>agricultural</b> <b>bibliographies</b> dealing with Africa'. If the first two guides will remain as working documents, the third one will be developed further and jointly published by CTA and the International Federation for Documentation (IFD) in 1988. The value of this bibliographic directory is that it offers a synthesis of agricultural information relevant for use in Africa. Other practical results of the workshop included two project proposals. The first calls for the preparation of a bibliography on women and development in Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi and Zambia, and the second for the rehabilitation of the documentation resources of the Department of Agriculture in Ghana. Both of these projects may be funded by CTA or the FAO as a follow-up to this workshop. Exhaustive but productive Two field trips were organized for participants. The first one saw them visit the library of the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences at the University of Malawi (Bunda College) where they were briefed on a course erititled 'How to use documentation'. During the second visit, at the Department of Agricultural Research in Chitedze, they were given a demonstration on the use of micro-computers for literature searches, the development of local data bases, and access to international agricultural databases (notably CABI and AGRICOLA) with CDROM technology. Two aspects of this training proved to be particularly popular with participants: information retrieval from different sources (individuals, institutions and documents) and the collection of current agricultural documentation produced at the national level in order to stock a national agricultural library. According to the evaluation sheets, the workshop was exhaustive but highly productive. As a result of similarly positive reviews of the Dakar workshop, CTA intends to continue this kind of training activity. One is planned for 1988 in the Pacific region and another in 1989 for the Caribbean. A report on these activities, including an evaluation, is planned.
