Many printing inks and coatings used in the production of the printed graphic product contain metals which, after the disposal of graphic waste, can migrate to different systems and have a negative influence on the environment. Because of that, the concentration levels of metals (zinc, copper, chromium, cadmium, lead, and nickel) in the printed graphic <b>product</b> <b>wastes</b> have firstly been determined, and then the impact of those metals, through their migration from the printed graphic <b>product</b> <b>wastes</b> to the simulated environmental mediums with different pH values (acidic and neutral), has been estimated.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of recovering energy from bit:mass residues {{has attracted a}} lot of research interest due to the environmental problems associated with burning coal. Wood wastes generated from construction and demolition activities and other wood <b>product</b> <b>wastes</b> can be a good potential source of renewable energy. The present study was conducted by using Hong Kong as an example to assess the environmental sustainability of converting recycled wood wastes (from construction and demolition activities and other wood <b>product</b> <b>wastes)</b> to produce wood pellets for direct energy generation. The chemical and physical characteristics of different types of wood <b>product</b> <b>wastes</b> were tested. An attributional lifecycle assessment approach was used to assess and compare the environmental impacts and sustainability for heat generation from the pelletized bio-fuel and coal. The test results showed that the energy content, chemical compositions and the trace metal concentrations all met the relevant standards. The results also showed that significant impacts on health, ecosystem, climate change and resources damage can be potentially avoided by using wood pellets instead of coal for energy generation. The overall findings demonstrated that the proposed "energy recovery" approach for using wood pellets as a bio-fuel in Hong Kong is environmentally sustainable, which can provide an alternative route for managing wood <b>product</b> <b>wastes</b> with the added benefits of energy recovery, and may be more applicable in mega cities especially when city-based incineration is a concern.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess whether an {{existing}} sourcing strategy can effectively supply products of appropriate quality with acceptable levels of <b>product</b> <b>waste</b> if applied to an international perishable product supply chain. The authors also analyse whether the effectiveness of this sourcing strategy can be improved by including costs for expected shelf life losses while generating order policies. Design/methodology/approach – The performance of sourcing strategies is examined in a prototype international strawberry supply chain. Appropriate order policies were determined using parameters both with and without costs for expected shelf life losses. Shelf life losses during transport and storage were predicted using microbiological growth models. The performance of the resulting policies was assessed using a hybrid discrete event chain simulation model that includes continuous quality decay. Findings – The study's findings reveal that the order policies obtained with standard cost parameters result in poor product quality and large amounts of <b>product</b> <b>waste.</b> Also, including costs for expected shelf life losses in sourcing strategies significantly reduces <b>product</b> <b>waste</b> and improves <b>product</b> quality, although transportation costs rise. Practical implications – The study shows that in perishable product supply chain design a trade-off should be made between transportation costs, shortage costs, inventory costs, <b>product</b> <b>waste,</b> and expected shelf life losses. Originality/value – By presenting a generically applicable methodology for perishable product supply chain design, the authors contribute to research and practice efforts to reduce food <b>waste.</b> Furthermore, <b>product</b> quality information is included in supply chain network design, a research area that is still in its infancy...|$|R
