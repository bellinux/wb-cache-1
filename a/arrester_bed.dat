500|$|A major {{accident}} {{occurred at the}} intersection with Roe Highway on 30 December 1993. A truck lost control coming down Greenmount Hill and rolled over at the intersection, after crashing into six vehicles on the hill and another 14 at the intersection. One woman was killed, and another 12 people were injured, including four with serious injuries. It was Western Australia's worst accident that year, according to police, with the aftermath described by a witness as [...] "like a battlefield". This accident led {{to the construction of}} a truck <b>arrester</b> <b>bed</b> {{near the bottom of the}} hill. It has been used in emergencies several times since.|$|E

50|$|Due {{to a large}} {{increase}} of heavy truck traffic using the hill, the Truck <b>Arrester</b> <b>Bed</b> located {{at the lower end}} of the hill has been in place since an accident in 1993.|$|E
50|$|Additional {{signs for}} the two <b>arrester</b> <b>beds</b> on the descent have also been added, to {{encourage}} out of control drivers to use them as a safer alternative.|$|R
50|$|The South Eastern Freeway {{features}} 6 {{lanes of}} traffic, <b>arrester</b> <b>beds</b> and concrete median barriers, with street lighting between Glen Osmond and Crafers. The {{remainder of the}} length to the Swanport Bridge is dual carriageways with two lanes in each direction.|$|R

5000|$|Arrester bed: a gravel-filled ramp {{adjacent}} to the road that uses rolling resistance to stop the vehicle. [...] The required length of the bed depends on the mass and speed of the vehicle, the grade of the <b>arrester</b> <b>bed,</b> and the rolling resistance provided by the gravel.|$|E
50|$|On October 1, 2010, at {{approximately}} 1:45 p.m., a G-4 Gulfstream overshot the runway. It {{was stopped by}} an <b>arrester</b> <b>bed.</b> Seven passengers and two pilots were on the plane. No one was injured in the crash. The cause of the accident {{has not yet been}} determined.|$|E
50|$|A runaway truck ramp, runaway truck lane, escape lane, {{emergency}} escape ramp, or truck <b>arrester</b> <b>bed</b> is {{a traffic}} device that enables vehicles which are having braking problems to safely stop. It is typically a long, sand- or gravel-filled lane {{connected to a}} steep downhill grade section of a main road, and is designed to accommodate large trucks or buses. The ramp allows a moving vehicle's kinetic energy to be dissipated gradually in a controlled and relatively harmless way, helping the operator to stop it safely without a violent crash.|$|E

5000|$|An {{engineered}} materials arrestor system, {{engineered materials}} arresting system (EMAS), or <b>arrester</b> <b>bed</b> is {{a bed of}} engineered materials built {{at the end of}} a runway to reduce the risk of a runway excursion. Engineered materials are defined in FAA Advisory Circular No 150/5220-22B as [...] "high energy absorbing materials of selected strength, which will reliably and predictably crush under the weight of an aircraft". While the current technology involves lightweight, crushable concrete blocks, any material that has been approved to meet the FAA Advisory Circular can be used for an EMAS. The purpose of an EMAS is to stop an aircraft overrun with no human injury and minimal aircraft damage. The aircraft is slowed by the loss of energy required to crush the EMAS material. An EMAS is similar in concept to the runaway truck ramp made of gravel or sand. It is intended to stop an aircraft that has overshot a runway when there is an insufficient free space for a standard runway safety area (RSA). Multiple patents have been issued on the construction and design on the materials and process.|$|E
