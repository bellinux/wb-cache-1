These basement rocks were created during the late Mesozoic era, long before the Itcha Range formed. They are similar to rocks found in the Hazelton Group, situated north of the Itcha Range, and the Ootsa Lake Group of the Intermontane Belt.|$|E
5|$|Artists and {{craftsman}} operated as corporations (guilds) {{rather than}} as individual business. Inscriptions mention guilds of weavers, oilmen, artisans, basket and mat makers and fruit sellers. A Saundatti inscription refers to <b>an</b> <b>assemblage</b> <b>of</b> {{all the people of}} a district headed by the guilds of the region. Some guilds were considered superior to others, just as some corporations were, and received royal charters determining their powers and privileges. Inscriptions suggest these guilds had their own militia to protect goods in transit and, like village assemblies, they operated banks that lent money to traders and businesses.|$|E

However, lacking a Caucasian person to imitate MVP Randy Bass, the rabid crowd seized a plastic statue of Colonel Sanders (like Bass, the Colonel had a beard and was not Japanese) from a nearby KFC and tossed it off the bridge as an effigy.|$|E

5|$|The {{house today}} appears <b>an</b> <b>assemblage</b> <b>of</b> several {{architectural}} styles popular during the Victorian era. While the overall design and air {{could be described}} as Italianate, also present in the same entrance facade are examples of high Victorian Gothic, such as an Italianate seigneurial tower confused in design with a campanile tower. This tower complete with a glazed loggia is crowned by a French-style mansard roof with oversized chimneys masquerading as Renaissance ornament. The centrepiece of the same facade is a porte-cochère designed in a heavy neoclassical style.|$|E
5|$|The flora of Scotland is <b>an</b> <b>assemblage</b> <b>of</b> native {{plant species}} {{including}} over 1,600 vascular plants, more than 1,500 lichens and nearly 1,000 bryophytes. The {{total number of}} vascular species is low by world standard but lichens and bryophytes are abundant and the latter form a population of global importance. Various populations of rare fern exist, although the impact of 19th-century collectors threatened the existence of several species. The flora is generally typical of the north west European part of the Palearctic ecozone and prominent features of the Scottish flora include boreal Caledonian forest (much reduced from its natural extent), heather moorland and coastal machair. In addition to the native varieties of vascular plants there are numerous non-native introductions, now believed to make up some 43% of the species in the country.|$|E
5|$|The parish of Selborne lies in {{the extreme}} eastern corner of the county of Hampshire, {{bordering}} on the county of Sussex, and {{not far from the}} county of Surrey; is about fifty miles south-west of London, in latitude fifty-one, and near mid-way between the towns of Alton and Petersfield. Being very large and extensive, it abuts on twelve parishes, two of which are in Sussex—viz, Trotton and Rogate.... The soils of this district are almost as various and diversified as the views and aspects. The high part of the south-west consists of a vast hill of chalk, rising three hundred feet above the village, and is divided into a sheep-down, the high wood and a long hanging wood, called The Hanger. The covert of this eminence is altogether beech, the most lovely of all forest trees, whether we consider its smooth rind or bark, its glossy foliage, or graceful pendulous boughs. The down, or sheepwalk, is a pleasing park-like spot, of about one mile by half that space, jutting out on the verge of the hill-country, where it begins to break down into the plains, and commanding a very engaging view, being <b>an</b> <b>assemblage</b> <b>of</b> hill, dale, wood-lands, heath, and water. The prospect is bounded to the south-east and east by the vast range of mountains called the Sussex Downs, by Guild-down near Guildford, and by the Downs round Dorking, and Ryegate in Surrey, to the north-east, which altogether, with the country beyond Alton and Farnham, form a noble and extensive outline.|$|E

25|$|Soil is <b>an</b> <b>assemblage</b> <b>of</b> {{particles}} that {{have little to}} no cementation while rock (such as sandstone) may consist of an assembly of {{particles that}} are strongly cemented together by chemical bonds. The shear strength of soil is primarily due to interparticle friction and therefore, the shear resistance on a plane is approximately proportional to the effective normal stress on that plane. The {{angle of internal friction}} is thus closely related to the maximum stable slope angle, often called the angle of repose.|$|E

25|$|The grave also {{contained}} <b>an</b> <b>assemblage</b> <b>of</b> imported objects from Italy and the Greek world, {{all of them}} associated with the preparation of wine.

One of the latter was dated as c. 525 BC and represents the latest firmly dated find in the grave. It thus provides the best evidence, a terminus post quem for its date. The vessels probably were placed on wooden tables or benches that did not survive.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} reasons why {{underwater}} archaeology can make {{a significant contribution to}} our knowledge of the past. In the shipwreck field alone, individual shipwrecks can be of significant historical importance either because of the magnitude of loss of life (such as the Titanic) or circumstances of loss (Housatonic was the first vessel in history sunk by an enemy submarine). Shipwrecks such as Mary Rose can also be important for archaeology because they can form a kind of accidental time capsule, preserving <b>an</b> <b>assemblage</b> <b>of</b> human artifacts at the moment in time when the ship was lost.|$|E

According to Mahabharata itself, the Jaya was recited to the King Janamejaya, the great-grandson of Arjuna, by Vaisampayana, a disciple of Vyasa (then called the Bharata).
