Highlander is a fantasy series, yet I cared about the characters <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> know them... Vandernoot gave Tessa such vitality and charm that her death left me reeling." [...] Abramowitz said that Tessa's death strongly angered many viewers, and that [...] "...people hated me for killing her." ...|$|E
500|$|But none of {{this meant}} that Strang was {{illiterate}} or simple. [...] Although his teachers [...] "not unfrequently turned me off {{with little or no}} attention, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> was too stupid to learn and too dull to feel neglect," [...] Strang recalled that he spent [...] "long weary days... upon the floor, thinking, thinking, thinking... my mind wandered over fields that old men shrink from, seeking rest and finding none till darkness gathered thick around and I burst into tears." [...] He studied works by Thomas Paine and the Comte de Volney, whose book Les Ruines exerted a significant influence on the future prophet.|$|E

500|$|Olga was due {{to enter}} society {{in the summer of}} 1899, but after the death of her brother George at the age of 27, her first {{official}} public appearance was delayed by a year until 1900. She hated the experience, and later told her official biographer Ian Vorres, [...] "I felt <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> were an animal in a cage—exhibited to the public for the first time." [...] From 1901, Olga was appointed honorary Commander-in-Chief of the 12th Akhtyrsky Hussar Regiment of the Imperial Russian Army. The Akhtyrsky Hussars were famous for their victory over Napoleon Bonaparte at the Battle of Kulm in 1813, and wore a distinctive brown dolman.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{injuries}} to first team centre backs Simon Webster and Darren Pitcher, Primus made his professional debut against Birmingham City. The match {{took place at}} their substitute stadium Upton Park in November 1992 and Primus was awarded man of the match for his performance. Primus played the next two matches against Leicester City and Brentford but was disappointed with his performances. Primus made two further first team appearances in the 1992–93 season but soon found himself lower in the pecking order after other players returned from injury and Primus got injured. He {{felt that he had}} to leave the club: [...] "I really felt <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> wasn't wanted and that my days were numbered." ...|$|E
500|$|Sibelius {{continued}} to make changes to {{the final version of}} the tone poem as he sailed across the Atlantic Ocean aboard the steamship SS Kaiser Wilhelm II and even during rehearsals in Norfolk, but these last-minute changes, Andrew Barnett argues, must have been relatively [...] "minor", as the orchestral parts had been copied before his departure from Finland. Sibelius was delighted with the new piece, writing to Aino, [...] "It's <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> have found myself, and more besides. The Fourth Symphony was the start. But in this piece there is so much more. There are passages in it that drive me crazy. Such poetry". Neither the suite nor the Yale version of the tone poem was performed in Sibelius's lifetime, receiving their world premieres by Osmo Vänskä and the Lahti Symphony Orchestra on 19September and 24October 2002, respectively.|$|E

500|$|During free {{practice}} on Friday and Saturday, it was Lewis Hamilton and McLaren {{who set the}} pace, closely followed by championship contender Vettel and his Red Bull teammate Mark Webber. While Hamilton topped the time sheets in both Friday sessions, Jenson Button was quickest during the third session on Saturday morning. Fernando Alonso had a difficult first free practice, trailing Vettel by 0.465 seconds, {{twice as much as}} in previous races. However, he was able to lap faster than the German on the harder compound tyres in the second session. Ferrari looked stronger during the long run trials with Felipe Massa putting in the most consistently fast lap times, 0.1 seconds ahead of Hamilton. With high temperatures, tyre degradation was a concern for the teams in the paddock with Hamilton commenting that [...] "it felt almost <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> was sliding around the track with the tyres melting".|$|E
500|$|Two {{weeks prior}} to the group {{starting}} university, they decided that they would take a second gap year, and perform new material which the band felt did not suit their current outfit. Cave stated that [...] "I felt <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> couldn't write about anything personal, so I would make up semi-comical stories that weren't really important to anyone, not even me." [...] Fear of Flying disbanded in October 2007 with a MySpace bulletin stating [...] "Fear of Flying is DEAD ... White Lies is alive!", before introducing a darker sound and a new name that reflected their maturity. Cave stated that the band deleted their MySpace account [...] "without any token farewell gigs". McVeigh said that the current musical climate {{had an effect on}} the split, stating that [...] "Maybe a few years ago, we would have signed a deal and had a chance to make three albums [...] In the current climate...we’d have been dropped". When asked about the name change in an interview with a radio station in San Francisco, Jack Brown said that [...] "We just thought that we should perform these songs as a different band. We had songs that we felt weren't suitable for the band that we were in and we thought White Lies would be the perfect vehicle for the songs." ...|$|E
2500|$|After I {{had been}} {{studying}} with him for two years, Schoenberg said, [...] "In order to write music, {{you must have a}} feeling for harmony." [...] I explained to him that I had no feeling for harmony. He then said that I would always encounter an obstacle, that it would be <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> came to a wall through which I could not pass. I said, 'In that case I will devote my life to beating my head against that wall.' [...] " ...|$|E

2500|$|In one of {{his many}} {{hundreds}} of notes and letters, Keats wrote to Brawne on 13 October 1819: [...] "My love has made me selfish. I cannot exist without you– I am forgetful of every thing but seeing you again– my Life seems to stop there– I see no further. You have absorb'd me. I have a sensation at the present moment <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> was dissolving– I should be exquisitely miserable without the hope of soon seeing you...

2500|$|Both the cognoscenti and {{the public}} adored him. The {{librettist}} Paolo Rolli, a close friend and supporter of Senesino, commented: [...] "Farinelli has surprised me so much that I feel <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> had hitherto heard {{only a small part}} of the human voice, and now have heard it all. He has besides, the most amiable and polite manners ...." [...] Some fans were more unrestrained: one titled lady was so carried away that, from a theatre box, she famously exclaimed: [...] "One God, one Farinelli!" [...] and was immortalised in a detail of Plate II of William Hogarth's [...] "A Rake's Progress" [...] (she may also appear in Plate IV of his series [...] "Marriage à la mode" [...] of 1745).|$|E
2500|$|Jeff Cork from Game Informer {{scored the}} game an 8/10, saying: [...] "Creation and {{discovery}} are at Tearaways foundation, and I was still pleasantly {{surprised at the}} steady drip of new abilities, gameplay elements, and other novelties delivered throughout. Not everything lands, but the parts that do are outstanding. One thing did seem {{to get lost in}} the move to PS4, though: Tearaway on Vita was an intimate experience. Holding the device close to my face, it felt <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> was privy to a secret directly from Media Molecule. I’m glad to see the adventure on the big screen, but the console experience feels less personal, and the journey loses {{a little bit in the}} transition. That said, Tearaway Unfolded is still a great game for families or anyone else who’s looking for an uplifting change of pace." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hall was a {{tall and}} muscular cricketer, [...] tall and bearing the [...] "physique and {{strength}} of a bodybuilder." [...] He had a graceful, classical action {{and one of the}} longest run-ups in Test cricket. A genuinely fast bowler, he was timed at [...] Hall was able to sustain pace and hostility for very long spells—during the Test against England at Lord's in 1963 he bowled unchanged for over three hours on the final day. While Hall was an aggressive fast bowler, he was not one to set out to injure the batsman. The England cricketer Ted Dexter—himself hit several times by Hall—said [...] "there was never a hint of malice in [...] or in his bowling". Hall himself said after one of his deliveries fractured Australian cricketer Wally Grout's jaw [...] "It made me sick to see Wal leaving and it made me sicker to hear some jokers in the crowd ranting on <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> had intentionally hurt [...] ".|$|E

2500|$|Production of {{the song}} began in early 1986. Joel {{considered}} Ray Charles one of his idols. [...] "Ray Charles was my hero when I was growing up," [...] Joel recalled. [...] "As big of a pianist or as big of a star I could ever become, I could never be Ray Charles." [...] According to Joel, when Charles heard that Joel named his daughter, Alexa Ray, after him, Charles contacted him saying that he'd love to do a song with Joel, {{as long as he}} had the [...] "right song" [...] in mind. When writing the song, Joel tried to compose it in the style of Charles' hit, [...] "Georgia on My Mind", while also giving it a blues sound. Joel wrote the song over a single night.

[...] I'm not a Buddhist any more." [...] In further reaction to their criticism, he quoted part of Abe Green's cafe recitation, Thrasonical Yawning in the Abattoir of the Soul: [...] "A gaping, rabid congregation, eager to bathe, are washed over by the Font of Euphoria, and bask like protozoans in the celebrated light." [...] Many consider that this clearly indicated Kerouac's journey on an emotional roller coaster of unprecedented adulation and spiritual demoralization.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{new year}} of 1942, Ryle took Wittgenstein {{to his home in}} Sussex to meet his wife who had been adamant to meet him. Ryle's son {{recorded}} the weekend in his diary;Wink is awful strange – not a very good english speaker, keeps on saying ‘I mean’ and ‘its “tolerable”’ meaning intolerable. The hospital staff were not told {{he was one of the}} world's most famous philosophers, though some of the medical staff did recognize him—at least one had attended Moral Sciences Club meetings—but they were discreet. [...] "Good God, don't tell anybody who I am!" [...] Wittgenstein begged one of them. Some of them nevertheless called him Professor Wittgenstein, and he was allowed to dine with the doctors. He wrote on 1 April 1942: [...] "I no longer feel any hope for the future of my life. It is <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> had before me nothing more than a long stretch of living death. I cannot imagine any future for me other than a ghastly one. Friendless and joyless."
