5|$|In 1974, Asian Wood {{was given}} <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{on a world}} tour. Lee quit his job as an {{engineer}} {{in order to be}} the band's drummer. Asian Wood's members moved to Hawaii to start their tour, but it was cancelled two weeks later. The promoter wanted a straight rock band without country influences. This left Lee and his family stranded in Hawaii until they could earn money for travel back home. The band reinvented itself, covering Top 40 popular songs in order to attract work. Asian Wood took on other gigs around Hawaii for 18 months before breaking up. Lee continued doing solo gigs for six months after that, before returning to the Bay Area for an engineering job with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He also worked as an independent salesperson for several small speaker companies in San Francisco.|$|E

Phil then officially takes over, igniting a resumption of the past feud with Tony and refusing to compromise with Tony on a garbage deal. When Tony assaults a Lupertazzi soldier for harassing Meadow while she is on a date, Phil decides it's time to decapitate the Soprano crew. He orders the executions of Bobby Baccalieri, who is shot to death; Silvio, who ends up comatose; and Tony, who goes into hiding. A deal is brokered whereby {{the rest of the}} Lupertazzi family agrees to ignore the order to kill Tony, giving Tony <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> after Phil. An FBI agent informs Tony of Phil's location, allowing Tony to have him killed. Tony suspects that Carlo, a capo from New Jersey, has become an informant in an attempt to help out his son, who has recently been caught for dealing ecstasy.

25|$|However, {{after the}} second half began, the game took on a {{different}} complexion as Dublin seized the lead by scoring three consecutive points. However, Mayo reclaimed the lead early into the half as Lee Keegan scored a goal to put his team one point ahead. The talking point of the match occurred in the 48th minute, as Dublin's John Small, who had previously received a yellow card in the first half, was sent off for a foul on Colm Boyle. However, Donal Vaughan of Mayo was also sent off after striking Small in the face {{in retaliation for the}} foul. This left both teams reduced to fourteen men for the remaining duration of the game. After seventy minutes of the game had elapsed, the teams were tied at 1-16 apiece, and it appeared that the game was destined for a draw and replay. In the seventy-first minute, Mayo were awarded a kickable free and <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> ahead. Cillian O'Connor, who had missed a free under a similar scenario in the previous final, took the kick, and missed, having it strike the post and rebound away from goal. Ciarán Kilkenny was given a black card by the referee for cynical play. Then, with a mere minute of the six additional minutes remaining, Diarmuid Connolly was fouled approximately forty-five metres from the Mayo goal, leaving Dublin with a kick to win the game. Dean Rock, the son of Barney Rock, {{one of the most famous}} Gaelic footballers from the capital, took the free. Lee Keegan controversially threw a GPS device at Rock as he took the free, yet the Dubliner was undeterred and converted. This left the defending champions one point ahead, and after reclaiming the ball from the Mayo kick-out, Dublin maintained possession until the final whistle was blown. Stephen Cluxton, the Dublin captain, then lifted the Sam Maguire Cup for the fifth time in seven years.|$|E

He pursued a permanent position with Osborne, declining <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Jamaica as a correspondent for the Herald, and was hired in November 1906. For the next three years, Howe blended his two jobsreporter and political operativeusing information from each in service of the other. Osborne intended eventually to run for governor himself. However, he was made a nonviable candidate by his unusual propensity to travel in a variety of disguises and his close friendship with a young handyman, with whom Osborne was rumored to have a homosexual relationship. Howe lost interest in Osborne as a patron and began searching for another upcoming name with whom to associate; Osborne fired him in 1909.|$|E

The premiere of this series was postponed several times. Its original script created by Ilya Kulikov and Yevgeny Nikishov had been inspired by [...] "The Blair Witch Project", with which it actually is very much alike, though the story actually takes place in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Later on, it was completely rewritten by the authors on the request of the creative producer of the TNT channel Valery Fedorovich.

In this place they suddenly get <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to 1986 and prevent the catastrophe in the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. But the Zone itself turns into their worst enemy. As the story goes on, the initial road-movie transfers into a mystical thriller, then into an action film, a disaster film, and finally, the last series of the first season leaves a possibility for the continuation in the genre of [...] "alternate history" [...] in which the Soviet Union avoids dissolution, and the US is losing its superpower status.|$|E
