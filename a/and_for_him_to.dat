25|$|In summer 1984, {{before the}} third-season premiere, The show's {{producers}} announced the character Frasier Crane, portrayed by Kelsey Grammer, {{was to be}} Diane's love interest and Sam's intellectual rival. They intended for Diane to end her relationship with Frasier within a few episodes, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> leave the show, but Grammer's performance was well-received, so his role was extended for the whole season. Long was still married to stockbroker Bruce Tyson and was pregnant with his child, and a storyline involving Diane Chambers's out-of-wedlock pregnancy was speculated with either Sam or Frasier as the father. The producers deemed the pregnancy idea undesirable and abandoned it. Instead, Diane was written as childless.|$|E

It was revealed that Hevesi had actually hired four, not the two employees initially thought for his wife's 'security detail' and said employees were running personal errands according to the report from the Attorney General Office. On December 13, 2006, a poll conducted between December 5–11 by Quinnipiac showed that 45% of people in New York felt that Hevesi should resign and 43% felt he had paid his debt to the state. 1,144 registered voters in New York were polled with a margin of error of +/- 2.9 percent.|$|E

25|$|Historical {{repression}} {{of identity and}} the inability to practice their culture and language has led the Talysh to an internalized self repression. This {{makes it hard to}} gauge support for any type of Talysh movement. According to Hema Kotecha, many Talysh fear being associated with the separatist Talysh-Mughan Autonomous Republic, with Russia, or with Armenia if they acknowledged or attempted to talk about their beliefs in the public sphere. One instance of current repression was when a school in Lerik wanted to invite a poet from Lenkoran to have a party in his honor <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> speak to Children; the headmaster was told that he would be dismessed if the event went ahead. The fear of the police is also another factor to this silence, although support for a secular democracy and shared Azerbaijani-Talysh feelings towards Nagorno-Karabakh contribute as well.|$|E

In April 2017, Yoshiki debuted a special collaboration T-Shirt with rock group KISS titled “YOSHIKISS”. During these performances, he lost sensation {{in his left}} hand and was rediagnosed with cervical foraminal stenosis. In May 2017, it was announced that Yoshiki would undergo emergency cervical artificial disc replacement surgery in Los Angeles on May 16, resulting in the cancelling of his schedule for May, and future events being possibly cancelled or rescheduled based on discussions after his surgery. The surgery was successful, with his surgical wound expected to take six weeks to heal, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> make a 90% recovery in six months.

25|$|According to some sources, on {{the morning}} of her death, she took a bath, put on new clothes and lay down in bed. She asked for Ali and {{informed}} him that her time to die was very close. Upon hearing this news, Ali began to cry but was consoled by Fatimah who asked him to look after her two sons <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> bury her without ceremony. It is further stated that her two sons were the first family members to learn of her death and immediately proceeded to the mosque to inform their father. Upon hearing the news, Ali fell unconscious. After recovering he followed Fatima's wishes and performed the janazah. He buried her during the night on 13 Jumada al-awwal 11AH (632 AD), also making three false graves to ensure her real grave could not be identified. With him were his family and a few of his close companions. After her death, Ali followed her wishes and buried her without informing the Medinan people.|$|E

He cites the [...] "Apocalypse in 9/8" [...] section of [...] "Supper's Ready", [...] "The Cinema Show" [...] and [...] "Domino" [...] as examples of this, and says the restrictions it gave him allowed the group to produce straightforward pop songs such as [...] "Invisible Touch" [...] and [...] "Land of Confusion" [...] in later years.|$|E
500|$|Planning and rehearsals for {{the concert}} took {{about three weeks}} in a Manhattan theater. The rehearsals were {{characterized}} by past tensions that resurfaced between the performers under the intense time pressure. Paul Simon later said: [...] "Well, the rehearsals were just miserable. Artie and I fought all the time." [...] An early concept was for each singer to give a solo performance, with Simon allotted the greater amount of time, and to conclude with the duo performing their joint works. This idea was rejected because, according to Garfunkel, [...] "It didn't seem right to either of us that Paul should be the opening act for Simon & Garfunkel, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> follow Simon & Garfunkel didn't make show-business sense". The two decided to perform most of the show together, with room for each to showcase some solo material. [...] Simon, who had resumed songwriting after a long hiatus, interrupted a series of studio recording sessions for the concert preparations. He used the live show {{as an opportunity to}} test one of his new songs in front of an audience. Garfunkel also planned to present a new song, [...] "A Heart in New York", from his soon-to-be released album Scissors Cut.|$|E

2500|$|Britannicus {{appears as}} a {{character}} in the novel Claudius the God by Robert Graves, in which Claudius belittles him {{as a means of}} keeping Britannicus obscure in the public eye and thus safe from harm.

It also claims that towards the end of his life Claudius came to believe that Britannicus may have been Caligula's son, not his own.

2500|$|From around 2006, campaigners {{including}} the then Northampton South MP, Brian Binley, and Phil Vasili, a biographer of Tull, {{called for a}} statue to be erected in his honour at Dover <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be posthumously awarded the Military Cross. However, as the Military Cross was not authorised to be awarded posthumously until 1979, and the change did not include any provision for retrospective awards, {{this would not be}} possible without a complete change in the rules. The campaigners felt this would be justified given that the army broke the rules in their favour in allowing Tull a commission at a time when, {{after the end of the}} Battle of the Somme in November 1916, the army was desperately short of officers. It therefore suited the needs of the army for Tull to be commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant. Unfortunately, when the recommendation for his Military Cross was considered at elite level, his 'illegal' [...] status as an officer of non-European descent meant to award him the honour would validate his status, leading to more mixed-heritage officers being commissioned, something the Army Council continued to resist to the end of the war.|$|E
2500|$|At {{this time}} the work of {{co-ordinating}} requests to government was co-ordinated in part of the West Midlands by Fisher's eldest son, Samuel Fisher junior, {{and it seems that}} it was he who, a little later, also sent to London petitions relating to nonconformist communities in Darlaston, Sedgley, and Rowley Regis, as well as a further house in Birmingham. These were all channelled through Robert Blayney, clerk of the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers, allegedly a former confidant of Oliver Cromwell, who handled a large volume of correspondence with government officials for the nonconformists outside London. It is likely that the petition relating to Fisher's Birmingham meetings was accompanied by a covering letter from Charles Fisher, the preacher's younger son, who probably lived in London and was known personally to Blayney. This made clear that the signatories included some of the principal citizens of Birmingham. Samuel junior's letter relating to Darlaston finished with the postscript [...] "I pray remember my fathers business," [...] suggesting there had been some delay in dealing with it. Shortly after, it was returned to Blayney, with an [...] "Endorsed" [...] mark. Licences for Samuel Fisher's house in Birmingham to be a Presbyterian meeting place <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> operate as a Presbyterian teacher in it were entered in government records on 1 May 1672, along with two of the Staffordshire licences, suggesting Blayner did actually expedite matters for Birmingham when he received the further requests from Samuel junior. Blayney picked up the Birmingham licences two days later.|$|E
