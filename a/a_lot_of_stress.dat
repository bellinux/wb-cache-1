[...] Speaking of Owen's PTSD storyline, McKidd stated: [...] "What's exciting about telling this story with this character is that it's quite brave of ABC and Shonda , on a prime-time network TV show, to address a tough subject, and one that people don't necessarily want to hear about. [...] But so far the writing room is handling it beautifully. They're not banging people {{over the head with}} it but exploring it in a sensitive and interesting way." [...] Owen and Cristina have struggled with their fictional relationship in season eight, leading to Owen having a sexual affair. Directly before the episode involving the affair aired, McKidd said to Entertainment Weekly: [...] "The thing about Owen is that he tries to do things perfectly, and obviously, he messes up as the chief because you have to make these odd black-and-white decisions and sometimes you make the wrong decision. There’s <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> in his life at the moment, so he’s trying not to let that affect his efficiency as chief." [...] Although the characters' marriage is tested, McKidd reported to The Hollywood Reporter: [...] "I think they're meant for each other. I hold out faith in Cristina and Owen, even though they go to the darkest places out of all the couples on the show. It's going to get worse but it's going to get better soon." ...|$|E

Teachers are put under <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> because the better students do on the test the more federal funding that school and district will receive. This causes teachers to teach to the test rather than teach to the life skills children will [...] use and need. In some cases, schools have shortened or removed recess so that more time can be spent preparing and practicing for the standardized tests. The pressure of this {{and the removal of}} a stress outlet, recess, means that children, along with teachers, are going to become depressed and sleep-deprived. Being depressed and sleep-deprived causes children to act out more than usual which places more stress on the teachers. Teachers do not get the results back {{until the end of the}} summer which means they will not be able to use those results to help those children because they will already be on to the next grade. Standardized tests place an unnecessary amount of stress on teachers and students without yielding any information in a timely manner.|$|E

[...] The band recorded in six-week spurts, traveling between studios in Toronto, Los Angeles and Maui, recording more songs. With no deadline from the record company, they kept recording and gaining more perspective. [...] "We'd get together, write, record, take two weeks off, go back in and we ended up doing that on and off for the last two-and-a-half or three years," [...] By this time, over forty songs were recorded including [...] "Picture", [...] "Don't Ask Why" [...] (Where Are You), [...] "Holy Ghost" [...] (Angels/Losing/Sleep) and [...] "Vampires", which was briefly considered for the album's title. The sessions became strained at times as the band couldn't figure out where the album was going. [...] "We had so many songs," [...] said Taggart, [...] "and we just started to go crazy." [...] Many songs went through multiple incarnations such as [...] "Boy", which caused the band <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> and took over three weeks to break down and re-record.

Self-estrangement is when a person feels alienated from others and society as a whole.

It has in other words served {{as a source for}} all aspects of the lives of Muslims. As an object of academic study, hadith has also been subjected into a serious investigation both to prove its authenticity in its narration and message, and to elaborate certain points of importance. Critical studies of hadith have been common in academic circles in the Muslim world and in the Western universities, one of which focuses on the contextual meaning of it. It is toward this end that this paper is aimed at. It is an attempt to make a contribution in the contextual analysis of hadith. By contextual analysis we mean a study that puts <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>stressing</b> on the meaning of a hadith by looking at the context from which it was said or reported. This way of studying hadith would help to understand it better in line with the dynamic nature of Islam. The paper argues that a hadith cannot be understood in isolation from its context. It also maintains that understanding its context would mean that one would be able to unveil and even reconstruct the hadith epistemology. Since the epistemology of a hadith lies in its meaning, the re-interpretation of a hadith according to its context would mean rediscovering the new dimension of the epistemology...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Tool {{nose radius}} is an {{important}} geometrical parameter {{in the design of}} the tool. Due to its direct contact with the workpiece surface it have significant effect not only on the resulting surface quality but also on the tool life. Use of an end mill without nose radius can easily blend during machining due to <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>stresses</b> acting on the edge of the tool while the large nose radius end mill can increase the strength and rigidity of the tool but can also contribute in increasing the friction between the tool and the workpiece. Therefore careful selection of tool nose radius is important and especially important for Polycrystalline Diamond, PCD insert as this tool material has recently shown great success in terms of tool life, surface roughness and productivity over coated and uncoated carbide tools in high speed end milling of titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and with the use of correct tool geometry it can be further helpful in increasing tool life and surface quality. This study therefore investigates the effect of various nose radii’s (R 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 8, 1. 2, 1. 6, 2. 4, 3. 2) and complete round insert end mill on cutting forces and heat distribution between tool and the chip for PCD insert and compare the results with multi-layer (Al 2 O 3 +TiAlN+TiN) coated carbide tool at high speed cutting conditions using 3 -D finite element numerical simulations.
