The specificity of Lyt- 2 + IL- 2 -secreting T cells for class I MHC allodeterminants was confirmed by the observations that: (a) their activation could be blocked completely by anti-class I mAbs, (b) they could be triggered by Ia- cell lines which expressed class I MHC <b>alloantigens</b> and possessed accessory function, and (c) they responded to class I MHC <b>alloantigens</b> but failed to respond to class II MHC <b>alloantigens,</b> even in the presence of exogenously added second signals that circumvented the requirement for alloantigen-bearing accessory cells.

If the graft has these ligands on its surface, NK cell cannot be activated (KIR receptors provide inhibitory signal). So if these ligands are missing, there is no inhibitory signal and NK cell becomes activated. It recognizes target cells by “missing-self strategy” [...] and induces their apoptosis by enzymes perforin and granzymes released from its cytotoxic granules. Alloreactive NK cells also secrete proinflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α to increase expression of MHC molecules and costimulatory receptors {{on the surface of}} APCs (antigen-presenting cells).
