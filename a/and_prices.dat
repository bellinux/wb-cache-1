40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{forecast}} demand for existing single-family {{housing in the}} United States. We first find that sales volume (sales) <b>and</b> median sales <b>price</b> (price) have unit roots. We then find that sales <b>and</b> <b>price</b> are cointegrated. We develop a vector autoregressive (VAR) model with error correction to further examine the causality between sales <b>and</b> <b>price.</b> We find that there exists a bidirectional causality relationship between sales <b>and</b> <b>price.</b> Price affects sales significantly <b>and</b> sales affects <b>price</b> weakly. With the VAR model we then forecast sales <b>and</b> <b>price</b> for existing single-family housing during the period 1991 to 1994 by using a recursive method.

5|$|Another coup in June 1966, the {{so-called}} Argentine Revolution, brought Juan Carlos Onganía to power. Ongania appointed Adalbert Krieger Vasena {{to head the}} Economy Ministry.

5|$|Even {{before the}} end of the first {{outbreak}} of the Black Death, there were efforts by the authorities to stem the upward pressure on wages <b>and</b> <b>prices,</b> with parliament passing the emergency Ordinance of Labourers in 1349 and the Statute of Labourers in 1351. The efforts to regulate the economy continued as wages <b>and</b> <b>prices</b> rose, putting pressure on the landed classes, and in 1363 parliament attempted unsuccessfully to centrally regulate craft production, trading and retailing. A rising amount of the royal courts' time was involved in enforcing the failing labour legislation – as much as 70% by the 1370s. Many land owners attempted to vigorously enforce rents payable through agricultural service rather than money through their local manor courts, leading to attempts by many village communities to legally challenge local feudal practices using the Domesday Book as a legal basis for their claims. With the wages of the lower classes still rising, the government also attempted to regulate demand and consumption by reinstating the sumptuary laws in 1363. These laws banned the lower classes from consuming certain products or wearing high-status clothes, and reflected the significance of the consumption of high-quality breads, ales and fabrics as a way of signifying social class in the late medieval period.|$|E

The Nazis encouraged the development of synthetic replacements for materials such as oil and textiles.

By 1936, Farben regretted making the deal, as the excess profits by then being generated had to be given to the government.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{ships are}} removed from the fleet by going through {{a process known as}} ship {{breaking}} or scrapping. Ship-owners and buyers negotiate scrap prices based on factors such as the ship's empty weight (called light ton displacement or LDT) <b>and</b> <b>prices</b> in the scrap metal market. In 1998, almost 700ships were scrapped in places like Alang, India and Chittagong, Bangladesh. This is often done by 'beaching' the ship on open sand, then cutting it apart by hand with gas torches, a dangerous operation that results in injuries and fatalities, as well as exposure to toxic materials such as asbestos, lead, and various chemicals. Half a million deadweight tons worth of bulk carriers were scrapped in 2004, accounting for 4.7% of the year's scrapping. That year, bulkers fetched particularly high scrap prices, between $340 and $350 per LDT.|$|E

5|$|Keynes {{contended that}} {{economic}} output is {{positively correlated with}} money velocity. He explained the relationship via changing liquidity preferences: people increase their money holdings during times of economic difficulty by reducing their spending, which further slows the economy. This paradox of thrift claimed that individual attempts to survive a downturn only worsen it. When the demand for money increases, money velocity slows. A slowdown in economic activities means markets might not clear, leaving excess goods to waste and capacity to idle. Turning the quantity theory on its head, Keynes argued that market changes shift quantities rather than prices. Keynes replaced the assumption of stable velocity with one of a fixed price-level. If spending falls <b>and</b> <b>prices</b> do not, the surplus of goods reduces the need for workers and increases unemployment.|$|E
