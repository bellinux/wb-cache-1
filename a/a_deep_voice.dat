5|$|When Brian advises Stewie to “wait and see” {{whether or}} not he has cancer, Stewie says “Jim Henson had a wait and see attitude, and look what {{happened}} to him. Now we’ve got wrong-sounding Muppets,” a reference to Henson’s deadly Streptococcus pneumoniae infection that was discovered too late which led to his death in 1990. The scene then cuts to Kermit the Frog and the Swedish Chef in a dialogue sequence, with much different voice tones. The two would later appear {{at the end of the}} show, discussing the preceding events, when Fozzie Bear walks in, and says in <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>voice</b> (supplied by actor Michael Clarke Duncan): “Wocka wocka. Who wants to hear a funny-ass joke?”.|$|E
25|$|Androgens, such as {{testosterone}} and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), are {{the major}} sex hormones in XY chromosomed individuals, and {{are responsible for the}} development and maintenance of masculine secondary sexual characteristics, such as <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>voice,</b> broad shoulders, and a masculine pattern of hair, muscle, and fat distribution. In addition, they stimulate sex drive and the frequency of spontaneous erections and are responsible for acne, body odor, and masculine-pattern scalp hair loss. Androgens act by binding to and activating the androgen receptor (AR), their biological target in the body. In contrast to androgens, antiandrogens are drugs that prevent the effects of androgens in the body. They do this by preventing androgens from binding to the AR or by preventing the production of androgens. The most commonly used antiandrogens in transgender women are cyproterone acetate, spironolactone, and GnRH analogues.|$|E
500|$|Kenneth tells Jack {{that when}} he and Tracy watch the show Lost he always holds Tracy's hand, due to the show's mysterious plots. After {{learning}} that Tracy has quit the show, Liz mocks Jack, in <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>voice,</b> saying [...] "Be a manager. Control your people. Buy better clothes." [...] Jack explains his plans to her on how he will get Tracy to return, with Liz once again mocking Jack, this time in a deep raspy voice, [...] "Just get it done. Nope. I lost it. That was Batman", a reference to actor Christian Bale's voice as the superhero in the Batman films.|$|E

500|$|Al Gore, former Vice President of the United States, {{is shown}} celebrating Lisa's {{purchase}} of his book, Sane Planning, Sensible Tomorrow, {{by listening to}} [...] "Celebration" [...] by Kool & the Gang. Additionally, a parody of The X-Files theme song is played {{in the background of}} the scene leading into Gore's celebration. [...] "Foggy Mountain Breakdown" [...] is played during a chase scene, reminiscent of a recurring theme of the 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde. When Professor Frink takes the tonic, he transforms into a suave man with <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>voice,</b> which is a reference to Jerry Lewis transforming into Buddy Love in The Nutty Professor. Grampa, within proper context, successfully pronounces the word pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis.|$|E
500|$|Darryl discovers {{warehouse}} worker Val (Ameenah Kaplan) has knitted him a beanie. Unsure if {{she intended}} it as a romantic gift or simply one of friendship, Darryl decides {{to find out}} by giving her a Valentine's Day gift of an expensive pair of cashmere ladies' gloves with a romantic card. Upon discovering that Val had knitted a beanie {{for everyone in the}} warehouse, an embarrassed Darryl passes the gloves off to warehouse worker Nate (Mark Proksch), who is moved by the gift. Darryl is further disappointed when a man named Brandon calls asking for the address of the warehouse to send flowers to his girlfriend Val. He is intrigued, however, when she says the flowers were from her mother, despite him pointing out the caller had had <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>voice</b> and gone by the name Brandon. Darryl decides Val's gift was [...] "a love beanie".|$|E
500|$|Considered a horrorcore song, [...] "Monster" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as brooding, disturbing, creepy and the [...] "weirdest A-list event-rap posse cut in recent memory." [...] The song begins with an ominous, distorted vocal roar, sung by Justin Vernon of Bon Iver, with Vernon declaring [...] "I shoot the lights out", which sets up the dark atmosphere of the track. The intro of the song is followed by a brief verse given by Ross, delivered in the rapping style of boom bap. In <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>voice,</b> Ross asserts the lines [...] "bitch, I'm a monster, no good bloodsucker, fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble," [...] over the eerie production featured during the beginning. Following the introduction by Ross, West then provides the song's hook, singing [...] "everybody know / I'm a motherfuckin' monster" [...] in a heavily distorted manner. West then launches into a full verse. Chicago Sun-Times writer Thomas Conner stated that West rhyming [...] "esophagus" [...] with [...] "sarcophagus" [...] was surely a hip-hop first.|$|E

5000|$|Soundtrack was {{composed}} by Ilayaraja. S.P. Balasubramaniam rendered the song [...] "Nachina Fuddu Vechani Beddu" [...] in <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>voice</b> {{to match the}} character Rayudu's voice and had to undergo nodule surgery. Subsequently, all the songs were sung by Mano and K. S. Chithra for Tamil version.|$|R
500|$|... "Strawberry Bubblegum" [...] {{begins with}} the sound of a stylus {{dropping}} on a vinyl record. The line [...] "Hey, pretty lady" [...] is declared by <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>voice,</b> and Timberlake sings [...] "This goes out to you!". ABC News reporter Allan Raible wrote that [...] "such a move seems engineered to make gullible teen girls in the audience scream". The lyrics feature daft double-entendres and are complemented by spoken-word background vocals. MusicOMH's David Meller wrote that the song's transition into [...] "’70s funk-cum-porno keyboards" [...] is likable, but may seem ridiculous to many listeners. The string loops and the record scratches on the song complete [...] "the faux-vintage" [...] vibe of [...] "Strawberry Bubblegum". Raible concluded that it attempts to sound like Michael Jackson's 2002 song [...] "Butterflies" [...] because of its delicate tone. According to Clyde Erwin Barretto of Prefix Mag, [...] "Strawberry Bubblegum" [...] takes its R style in a more avant-garde direction, but its second half is more classic-sounding. Craig Manning of the Western Herald said that the first half of [...] "Strawberry Bubblegum" [...] draws from Frank Ocean's psychedelic style of R, while the outro is more comparable to the music of 'NSYNC, Timberlake's former group. Jason Lipshutz called the outro [...] "sashaying" [...] and [...] "pleasant".|$|E
500|$|Bill Fagerbakke voiced SpongeBob's best friend, a starfish named Patrick Star in the episode. He {{auditioned for}} the role after Kenny had been cast as SpongeBob. [...] Fagerbakke said, [...] "Steve is such a lovely guy, and I had {{absolutely}} no feeling for the material whatsoever." [...] He described his experience in the audition, saying [...] "I was just going in for another audition, and I {{had no idea what}} was in store there in terms of the remarkable visual wit and really the kind of endearing child-like humanity in the show. I couldn't pick that up from the audition material at all. I was just kind of perfunctorially trying to give the guy what he wanted." [...] For the part of Squidward, Hillenburg originally had Mr. Lawrence in mind {{for the role}}. Lawrence worked with Hillenburg and Drymon before on Rocko's Modern Life, so while working on the episode, Hillenburg invited him to audition for all the characters. Drymon said, [...] "We were showing Doug the storyboard, and he started reading back to us in his Tony the Tiger/Gregory Peck voice. It was really funny, and we wound up having SpongeBob use <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>voice</b> when he entered the Krusty Krab for the first time." [...] Hillenburg decided to give Lawrence the part of the series villain, Plankton, instead.|$|E
500|$|While Hillenburg, Derek Drymon, and Tim Hill {{were writing}} the pilot [...] "Help Wanted", Hillenburg was also {{conducting}} auditions to find voices {{for the show}} characters. He had created the character of SpongeBob with Tom Kenny, in which he utilised Kenny's and other people's personalities to help create SpongeBob's personality. The voice of SpongeBob was originally used by Kenny for a minor female alligator character named Al in Rocko's Modern Life. Kenny forgot the voice initially as he created it only for that single use. Hillenburg, however, remembered {{it when he was}} coming up with SpongeBob and used a video clip of the episode to remind Kenny of the voice. Kenny says that SpongeBob's high pitched laugh was specifically aimed at being unique, stating that they wanted an annoying laugh in the tradition of Popeye and Woody Woodpecker. Hillenburg originally had Mr. Lawrence for the role of voicing Squidward. Drymon said [...] "We knew Doug from Rocko, where he was a storyboard director and where he also did the voice of Filburt. We were showing Doug the storyboard, and he started reading back to us in his Tony the Tiger/Gregory Peck voice. It was really funny, and we wound up having SpongeBob use <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>voice</b> when he entered the Krusty Krab for the first time." [...] Hillenburg loved the voice and decided to let Lawrence play a variety of incidental characters, including Plankton.|$|E

2500|$|German singer-songwriter Frank Farian (real name Franz Reuther) {{recorded}} the dance track [...] "Baby Do You Wanna Bump" [...] in December 1974.

50|$|Another {{function}} of the Adam's apple {{is related to the}} deepening of the voice. During adolescence, the thyroid cartilage grows together with the larynx. Consequently, the laryngeal prominence grows in size mainly in men. Together, a larger soundboard is made up in phonation apparatus and, as a result, the man gets <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>voice</b> note.|$|R

2500|$|In North America, Creme Eggs are advertised on {{television}} {{with a small}} white rabbit called the Cadbury Bunny (alluding to the Easter Bunny) which clucks like a chicken. Ads for caramel eggs use a larger gold-coloured rabbit which also clucks, and chocolate eggs use a large brown rabbit which clucks in <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>voice.</b> [...] The advertisements use the slogan [...] "Nobunny knows Easter better than him", spoken by TV personality Mason Adams. The ads have continued to air nearly unchanged into the high definition era, though currently the ad image is slightly zoomed to fill the screen. The majority of rabbits used in the Cadbury commercials are Flemish Giants.|$|E
2500|$|Carola had <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>voice</b> and an accosting manner without frills, {{concentrated}} on the phrasing. Her storytelling technique was accompanied by the grooviness of her supporting orchestras, co-produced by her. Partially, the style was inspired by American jazz singers of the 1950s. Simultaneously, {{it was in the}} spirit of the modal jazz scene going down in Europe in the 1960s. Mostly, Carola's jazz repertoire consisted in idiosyncratic versions of American songs. Examples include [...] "Just Give Me Time" [...] by Francy Boland and Jimmy Woode, [...] "So Long, Big Time" [...] by Dory Langdon and Harold Arlen, and [...] "Lonely Woman" [...] by Margo Guryan and Ornette Coleman. Carola's most famous track in the genre was the swinging [...] "The Flame" [...] composed and arranged by Esa Pethman and lyrics by Carola herself.|$|E

Paté was introduced briefly on the second episode of the first show Chowder's Girlfriend (Episode #1b), where he sings [...] "I'm Not Your Boyfriend" [...] on stage to Panini (on behalf of Chowder) {{in front of an}} audience. His name, however, was revealed {{for the first time on}} The Apprentice Games (Episode 20), where he appeared as a judge for the Marzipan City Apprentice Games. In that same episode, it was also revealed that he lives in another dimension, as was shown by the portal through which he and Ceviche made their entrance and exit.|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{inspiration}} for album's single [...] "Somewhere Down the Crazy River", Lanois commented, [...] "Robbie Robertson was describing {{what it was like}} to hang out in Arkansas with Levon Helm in his old neighbourhood. He was telling me about the hot nights and fishing with dynamite, and was asking someone for directions for someplace somewhere down the crazy river. ... I had presented him with this instrument that [...] Eno introduced me to called the Suzuki Omnichord, like an electric autoharp. He found a little chord sequence with it that was sweet and wonderful. As he was developing his chord sequence I recorded him and superimposed his storytelling, which I was secretly recording, on top. That was the birth of [...] 'Somewhere Down The Crazy River.' It's kind of like a guy with <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>voice</b> telling you about steaming nights in Arkansas." [...] This song is notable as Robertson's only solo hit in the UK, reaching number 15 on the UK singles chart. His follow-up single there, [...] "Fallen Angel" [...] (also from the album), reached number 95.|$|E
