40|$|Radiative heat exchanges inside {{buildings}} are responsible of a relevant {{part of the}} thermal balance of people occupying such confined spaces and, in turn, of their thermal comfort sensations. Mean radiant temperature of the internal surfaces is supposed to affect considerably this balance but, usually, it is computed by means of too simplified relationships that significantly affect the comfort evaluations. These simplified approaches can be also accountable of a less effective design of HVAC systems. Unfortunately, an accurate evaluation of the mean radiant temperature, especially when high intensity sources are present in a given internal space, depends on the <b>angle</b> <b>factors</b> between human subjects and surrounding surfaces of the enclosure. <b>Angle</b> <b>factors,</b> on the other hand, are a direct function of the projected area factors. Presently, {{there is still a}} certain lack in the availability of simple and reliable methods capable of computing <b>angle</b> <b>factors</b> of people in assigned postures, particularly for buildings characterized by a complex geometry. On the base of experimental results, obtained by means of a photographic apparatus on purpose designed, a comprehensive algorithm is presented for assessing <b>angle</b> <b>factors</b> of people living or working in confined spaces, where heat high intensity sources are present, and sun among them.

40|$|Abstract. Q-ball imaging (QBI) {{is a high}} angular {{resolution}} diffusion imaging (HARDI) technique which has been proven very successful in resolving multiple intravoxel fiber orientations in MR images. The standard computation of the orientation distribution function (ODF, the probability of diffusion in a given direction) from q-ball uses linear radial projection, neglecting {{the change in the}} volume element along the ray, thereby resulting in distributions different from the true ODFs. A new technique has been recently proposed that, by considering the solid <b>angle</b> <b>factor,</b> uses the mathematically correct definition of the ODF and results in a dimensionless and normalized ODF expression from a single q-shell. In this paper, we extend this technique in order to exploit HARDI data from multiple q-shells.

40|$|Q-ball imaging (QBI) {{is a high}} angular {{resolution}} diffusion imaging (HARDI) technique which has been proven very successful in resolving multiple intravoxel fiber orientations in MR images. The standard computation of the orientation distribution function (ODF, the probability of diffusion in a given direction) from q-ball data uses linear radial projection, neglecting {{the change in the}} volume element along each direction. This results in spherical distributions that are different from the true ODFs.
