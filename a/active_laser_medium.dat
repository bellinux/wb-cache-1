40|$|Abstract: It is {{well known}} that when the pump laser beam {{incidence}} on the laser dye liquid it will be absorbed. This absorption tends to heat the <b>laser</b> <b>active</b> <b>medium,</b> which is the laser dye solution. In view of this the correlated property of that active medium well change tends to shift the operated frequency and wavelength. Therefore, one of most interested dielectric, nonpolar, laser dye solvent was selected for this investigation, which is Benzene. A laser interferometer known as Mach Zhender Interferometer (MZI) is constructed and used to measure the refractive index of the investigated solvent by counting the interfering fringes {{as a function of the}} angle of incidence of the incident laser beam. The temperature of that solvent is raised within the range 293 - 373 K by using a constructed heating system. The thermal behavior of the refractive index of Benzene is studied to estimate the thermo-optical coefficient of the refractive index, which is important to know the state convergence or divergence of the pump laser beam within the <b>laser</b> dye <b>medium.</b> Also, the dielectric constant of the dye solution is an important parameter for the laser operation.
