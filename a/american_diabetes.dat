Fans complained that the legendary {{musician}} was debasing himself by doing the commercials, that he was selling out by allowing his image {{to be used to}} peddle fast food. Other groups such as the <b>American</b> <b>Diabetes</b> Association pointed out that King, known for having weight issues and poorly controlled diabetes, was a questionable spokesperson for a burger chain that sells products that are not part of a healthier diet. Finally, several firms complained off the record that King was inconsistent in his endorsements, selling a highly fattening product while similarly endorsing diabetic products manufactured by the Johnson & Johnson company.|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} the incidence rate {{of cardiovascular disease}} (CVD) and its association with conventional and less well-established risk factors in African <b>Americans</b> with <b>diabetes,</b> we studied 741 African Americans aged 45 to 64 years with diabetes, in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. Risk factors were measured from 1987 to 1989, and incident CVD (n = 143 coronary heart disease (CHD) or stroke events) was ascertained through 1998. The crude incidence rate (per 1000 person-years) of CVD was 22. 5 (11. 9 for CHD and 12. 0 for stroke). After multivariate adjustments, total cholesterol, prevalent hypertension and current smoking were significantly and positively associated with incident CVD among these African <b>Americans</b> with <b>diabetes.</b> Among the non-conventional risk factors, serum creatinine, factor VIII, von Willebrand factor, and {{white blood cell count}} were positively and serum albumin negatively and independently associated with CVD incidence. Adjusted relative risks for highest versus lowest tertiles of these risk factors ranged from 1. 77 to 2. 13. This study confirms that the major risk factors (hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and smoking) are important determinants of CVD in African <b>Americans</b> with <b>diabetes.</b> In addition, several blood markers of hemostasis or inflammatory response and elevated serum creatinine also proved to be CVD risk factors in African <b>Americans</b> with <b>diabetes...</b>|$|R

25|$|Blood {{pressure}} readings do vary but experts recommend that blood pressure should not range above 140/80.

The <b>American</b> <b>Diabetes</b> Association recommends that all diabetics get their blood pressure measured by a health care professional at least 2-5 times a year.|$|E
25|$|World Health Organization (WHO) {{criteria}} for {{impaired fasting glucose}} differs from the <b>American</b> <b>Diabetes</b> Association (ADA) criteria, because the normal range of glucose is defined differently by each.

25|$|However, it {{has been}} shown that the widely {{accepted}} WHO and <b>American</b> <b>Diabetes</b> Association diagnostic cutoff for diabetes of a fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7.0mmol/l (126mg/dl) does not accurately identify diabetic retinopathy among patients.

For the US-based component of the study, the sensitivity was 34.7% and specificity was 86.6%. For patients at similar risk to those in this study (15.8% had diabetic retinopathy), this leads to a positive predictive value of 32.7% and negative predictive value of 87.6%.|$|E

By 2050, the prevalence of diabetes could increase {{to as much as}} 33% of the population, largely due to the aging of the population and to people with diabetes living longer. Approximately 1.9 million new cases of diabetes are diagnosed each year. The disease was the seventh leading cause of death in 2007, directly claiming more than 71,000 lives and contributing to approximately 160,000 additional deaths. Patients with diabetes are two to four times more likely than those without it to die from cardiovascular disease, and diabetes is an important cause of blindness, kidney disease, and lower-extremity amputations.|$|E
