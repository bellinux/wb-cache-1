The very high sensitivity reported for detecting the sinusoidal deformation of circular contours may result from the presence and concordance of both orientation <b>and</b> <b>position</b> cues to shape difference. In this study, <b>position</b> <b>and</b> orientation-defined micropatch-sampled radial frequency (MSRF) patterns were employed, which permit the independent assessment of the contributions of local orientation <b>and</b> <b>position</b> features to shape integration. It was demonstrated that, while both local orientation <b>and</b> <b>position</b> features can encode shape deformation, the human visual system is more sensitive to orientation-defined shape difference than to position-defined shape difference. Furthermore, integration of the local orientation feature into shape is more than two times stronger than that of local <b>position,</b> <b>and</b> may involve a global pooling mechanism. Nevertheless, optimal shape discrimination performance requires the analysis of both local orientation <b>and</b> <b>position</b> features...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Market {{orientation}} <b>and</b> <b>positioning</b> {{have been}} widely recognized as organizational metrics linked to hotel performance. This study offered empirical evidence on the relationship among market orientation, <b>positioning,</b> <b>and</b> hotel performance in Ghana’s (luxury) hotel sector. It also reports on the joint effect of market orientation <b>and</b> <b>positioning</b> on hotel performance in the same sector. Design/methodology/approach: Three hypotheses were investigated {{on the relationship between}} market orientation <b>and</b> hotel performance; <b>positioning</b> <b>and</b> hotel performance; and the joint effect of market orientation <b>and</b> <b>positioning</b> on hotel performance. A survey of star rated (luxury) hotels in the capital city of Ghana was used. One hundred and five (105) responses were used in the analysis. Descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis and hierarchical regression were used to test the three (3) hypotheses. Findings: All hypotheses were accepted. Market orientation <b>and</b> <b>positioning</b> jointly affect hotel performance, and the study provides hotel managers with suggestions on to enhance their performance via market orientation <b>and</b> <b>positioning.</b> Research limitations/implications: Management perspectives on market orientation, <b>positioning</b> <b>and</b> hotel performance were sought to the exclusion of customers. Future studies may consider using customer perspectives as well. Practical implications: Hotels should consider adopting market oriented positioning strategies to improve on their performance.

40|$|The {{following}} thesis {{has five}} main objectives: - 1. To describe the role <b>and</b> <b>position</b> {{of women in}} clerical work in the period circa 1870 to 1914. 2. To understand {{the origins of the}} role <b>and</b> <b>position</b> of women in clerical work hierarchies and to offer reasons for this role <b>and</b> <b>position.</b> 3. To use and link theoretical perspectives which are useful in helping us to understand the origins of the role <b>and</b> <b>position</b> of women in clerical work. 4. To consider the impact of wider social structure upon the roles <b>and</b> <b>position</b> of women in clerical work. 5. To develop an overall framework for understanding the role <b>and</b> <b>position</b> of women in society and in work. These objectives will now be briefly expanded. 1. To describe the role <b>and</b> <b>position</b> of women in clerical work in the period circa 1870 to 1914. Throughout the thesis considerable space is given to describing the actual work, status and market situations of female clerks. This descriptive element is the background against which the theoretical framework is developed and tested. It also offers us some appreciation of what work was actually like for female clerks in the 1870 to 1914 period, and allows us to compare their conditions with late twentieth century clerks. 2. To understand the origins of the role <b>and</b> <b>position</b> of women, in clerical work hierarchies and to offer reasons for this role <b>and</b> <b>position</b> The thesis seeks to investigate the historical process through which females entered clerical work over the period 1870 to 1914. It seeks to assess the role of economic environment in drawing women into clerical work, and the changing 'status' of those women who become clerks. The thesis notes the 'status' of clerical work in the 1870 - 1914 period and how the perception of such work was changing. 3. To utilise and link theoretical perspectives which are useful in helping us to understand the origins of the role <b>and</b> <b>position</b> of women in clerical work The central objective of the thesis is to offer a theoretical framework for the analysis and comprehension of women's role <b>and</b> <b>position</b> within clerical work. In order to achieve this two approaches to the study of historical development are drawn on. Firstly, the concept of patriarchy; secondly elements of the labour process debate. It is argued throughout the thesis, but particularly in chapters six to eight, that within the context of clerical work, the 'gender dimension' is of crucial significance in determining the nature of female office work; their pay and conditions of work; their job prospects and opportunities; the determination of 'skill' in the office; control within the office. In short, the existence of a Patriarchal frame of reference has contributed to the structuration of and divisions within the clerical labour force. 4. To consider the impact of wider social structure upon the role <b>and</b> <b>position</b> of women in clerical work Intimately linked to objective three, the thesis aims to consider the impact of wider social structure and values on the role <b>and</b> <b>position</b> of women in clerical work. The importance of wider social values concerning the role <b>and</b> <b>position</b> of women within society is considered and related to the structuration of employment. The thesis argues that wider social structure and values are of crucial importance in determining the role <b>and</b> <b>position</b> of women within clerical work. 5. To develop an overall framework for understanding the role <b>and</b> <b>position</b> of women in society and in work The overall objective of this thesis is to contribute to the body of literature which seeks to understand the manner in which female employment patternsare determined, in part, by patriarchal social relations; that is, relations between men and women. It offers no assessment of how to overcome this problem, but, through recognition of the interrelationship between economic or capitalist development and patriarchal social relations in the clerical work context, the thesis aims to inform and educate on the subtlety and insidiousness of this relationship...|$|R
