5|$|Hemming singles out the conquests of England by Cnut and William the Conqueror {{as being}} {{especially}} damaging. He {{claims that the}} work only covers the lost estates that were assigned to support the cathedral chapter, but as he describes the loss of several manors that were listed in Domesday Book as belonging to the bishop, the work probably covers more than the author claims. It also contains a listing of amounts paid to King William to regain items the king had taken from the diocese. Worcester paid over 45.5 marks of gold to recover their belongings.

The volunteers to join Buckingham included Temple, his elder brother John <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> his family.
