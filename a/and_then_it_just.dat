When asked about the song {{in an interview with}} Billboard, Wade said, [...] "It was the most uptempo, radio-friendly song. We all decided it was the right choice to release it as the first single." [...] He went on to describe his expectations when writing songs, saying, [...] "My ultimate goal in writing songs is to connect with people. In the lyrics, you don't tell the whole picture: You give a road to start on that people can relate to. We're honest, nice guys and I hope that comes across in everything we do." [...] After being asked how he wrote the song in an interview with Launch, Wade explained, [...] "I wrote that song without thinking about what was gonna happen to it <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> kinda took over from there." [...] He also said in the interview that he wrote [...] "Hanging by a Moment" [...] in about five minutes.|$|E

2500|$|In a post-show {{interview}} clip on Austin City Limits, guitarist Munaf Rayani {{said about}} {{their status as}} instrumentalists, [...] "I mean, I think we discussed singing for half a second, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> kinda, we just dropped it. We just didn't go back to it because we were comfortable enough." [...] Drummer Chris Hrasky added, [...] "I think we just {{liked the idea of}} a band that there was not a leader or main songwriter, everyone sort of collaborating and has their own say. I don't think any of us want the sort of 'leader role', so a leaderless band is kind of the best option for us." ...|$|E

It’s very Spinal Tap to do a double-album, and acts sometimes take themselves too seriously, so we were at that point {{where we want to}} take ourselves seriously; and also we also always enjoy doing the soundscape stuff." ...|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} for Power 106, Gomez spoke in-depth about the inspiration behind [...] "Kill Em with Kindness", saying: [...] "Everybody has had a say in my life [...] meaning the world, the perception, the media. It was really frustrating. There is a song on my record called ‘Kill Em with Kindness.’ So I’ve always done that. I ignore, I ignore, I ignore. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> kind of got out of hand. So I went to the new label [...] and I was like, I have to say something. I need to say what I want to say, and you guys {{have to help me}} {{figure out how to do}} that." [...] While working on the album, Gomez enlisted frequent collaborators Rock Mafia to help make her sound a reality. They helped Gomez on the creation of six tracks on the album, including [...] "Revival" [...] and [...] "Kill Em with Kindness", the latter being one of the most personal tracks on Revival. She told the producers that although the production was important, she wanted the focus of the song to be the lyrics.|$|E

"The farmer {{was pretty}} busy that summer, {{and after the}} first two or three hoeings {{he had to leave}} the two pumpkin vines to the boy that had helped him to plant the seed, and the boy had to go fishing so much, and then in swimming, that he {{perfectly}} neglected them, and let them run wild, if they wanted to; and if the good little pumpkin vine had not been the best little pumpkin vine that ever was, it would have run wild. But it just stayed where it was, and thickened up, and covered itself with blossoms, till it was like one mass of gold. It was very fond of all its blossoms, and it couldn't bear hardly to think of losing any of them; but it knew they couldn't every one {{grow up to be a}} very large pumpkin, and so it let them gradually drop off till it only had one left, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> gave all its attention to that one, and did everything it could to make it grow into the kind of pumpkin it said it would.|$|E
60|$|It {{happened}} the night I {{went down to}} see Kitty Marr. I thought when I went that Aunt Olivia was visiting there and I could come home with her. But she wasn't there and I had to come home alone. Kitty came {{a piece of the}} way but she wouldn't come any further than Uncle James Frewen's gate. She said it was because it was so windy she was afraid she would get the tooth-ache and not because she was frightened of the ghost of the dog that haunted the bridge in Uncle James' hollow. I did wish she hadn't said anything about the dog because I mightn't of thought about it if she hadn't. I had to go on alone thinking of it. I'd heard the story often but I'd never believed in it. They said the dog used to appear {{at one end of the}} bridge and walk across it with people and vanish when he got to the other end. He never tried to bite anyone but one wouldn't want to meet the ghost of a dog even if one didn't believe in him. I knew there was no such thing as ghosts and I kept saying a paraphrase over to myself and the Golden Text of the next Sunday School lesson but oh, how my heart beat when I got near the hollow! It was so dark. You could just see things dim-like but you couldn't see what they were. When I got to the bridge I walked along sideways with my back to the railing so I couldn't think the dog was behind me. And then just in the middle of the bridge I met something. It was right before me and it was big and black, just about the size of a Newfoundland dog, and I thought I could see a white nose. And it kept jumping about from one side of the bridge to the other. Oh, I hope none of my readers will ever be so frightened as I was then. I was too frightened to run back because I was afraid it would chase me and I couldn't get past it, it moved so quick, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> made one spring right on me and I felt its claws and I screamed and fell down. It rolled off to one side and laid there quite quiet but I didn't dare move and I don't know what would have become of me if Amos Cowan hadn't come along that very minute with a lantern. And there was me sitting in the middle of the bridge and that awful thing beside me. And what do you think it was but a big umbrella with a white handle? Amos said it was his umbrella and it had blown away from him and he had to go back and get the lantern to look for it. I felt like asking him what on earth he was going about with an umbrella open when it wasent raining. But the Cowans do such queer things. You remember the time Jerry Cowan sold us God's picture. Amos took me right home and I was thankful for I don't know what would have become of me if he hadn't come along. I couldn't sleep all night and I never want to have any more adventures like that one.|$|E

5000|$|The album {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews, with many critics praising his newfound lyrical maturity {{and the production}} work. Andrew Martin of PopMatters wrote, [...] "Aside from the aforementioned stunning production, a strong cohesion exists in terms of subject matter and concept. D. Black sticks {{to the meaning of}} Ali’Yah closely. He and his production team will bring you right to the musical cloud nine now <b>and</b> <b>then.</b> <b>It’s</b> <b>just</b> a shame D. Black struggles to keep you there for a permanent residence." [...] A staff review by HipHopDX stated that [...] "D.

[...] "You could be really drugged up or {{stricken}} by madness, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>it's</b> about <b>just</b> needing an escape {{to get out}} of that.

50|$|Donna Loren’s role as Dr Pepper {{spokesperson}} led to {{her first}} appearance in the American International Pictures’ Beach Party film, Muscle Beach Party. Loren later explained: “Dr Pepper was involved in that Beach Party movies and actually placed me as product placement. And because I could sing, {{they gave me a}} duet with Dick Dale, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> went on from there.” From this, she went on to appear in three more Beach Party films. Away from the company, Loren was a familiar presence in the 1960s due to her many performances on television, films, and her records for Capitol, Reprise and other labels. She represented Dr Pepper until 1968.|$|E

5000|$|In 2011, {{the band}} {{released}} its second album on Riot Bear Recording Co. Produced by Steve Koester and Jason Mills, and recorded by Don Piper, the album featured {{the addition of}} Jude Webre on bass and Ben Wildenhaus (formerly of Federation X) on keyboards. From Chronogram Magazine's review: ”Two Dark Birds embrace the rich Catskill Roots Music template; Songs for the New abounds with sonic nods to The Band, Van Morrison’s Tupelo Honey, and the epic gestures of Mercury Rev. Fuzzy keyboards and fingerpicked acoustics rub against violins <b>and</b> horns, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>it’s</b> <b>just</b> Koester <b>and</b> Co. unplugged, offering a one-two punch of loss and exuberance over the metallic caress of a dobro. From barnburner to ballad, the full-grown men in Two Dark Birds execute these tunes with edgy intensity and hard-won grace.” In 2012, they released Black Blessed Night EP, a companion EP to the album, featuring alternate versions and alternate mixes {{of several of the}} songs from 'Songs for the New.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Preservation of {{exterior}} wear {{is characterized}} as leaving an antique car's body and paint unrestored {{and in an}} 'as-is' condition, or by preserving patina. Patina describes a vehicle's exterior which has [...] "a natural finish that embraces the years of wear, tear, and repair a vehicle has earned during decades of service." [...] Vintage vehicles with patina are often [...] "Valued for their originality and historical significance, not {{for the quality of}} restoration." [...] David Gooding, founder and president of Gooding & Company classic car auctions describes patina as [...] "the fingerprints of the manufacturers there, and the owner's. You look at a car with great patina and you know it has character like nothing else. It's got a personality, a unique personality, and when you see those cars get restored - they <b>just</b> totally loose <b>it.</b> It all gets cleansed and cleaned off <b>and</b> buffed <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>it's</b> <b>just</b> like everything else, and back down to a level." ...|$|R

5000|$|Later in his {{interview}} with Couric, Mellencamp delivered further insights into Sad Clowns & Hillbillies: [...] "It's crazy the way it started - {{it was going to}} be a religious record.

We'll try to write songs that sound like those songs, but they'll be new.' <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> kept evolving and evolving and evolving, and the songs that she was bringing and the songs that I was bringing - they weren't so religious.

5000|$|... "What A Pain In The Ass It Is…" [...] is {{a scathing}} track {{although}} Reyne {{has no intention}} of unveiling just who might be the song’s unnamed protagonist. “When it started off there was someone who inspired it, in the beginning, but not really, It quickly becomes just the usual amalgam of stuff and then you make up stuff, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> becomes a matter of playing with the words — you start enjoying yourself just playing with the words to make little twists and turns and rhymes and things like that.

5000|$|... "Ni Tú Ni Yo" [...] was {{produced}} by Oscar Hernandez [...] "Oscarcito" [...] and Motiff. In English, the title translates to [...] "neither you nor I". The track sees Lopez and Gente de Zona [...] "pronounce their love for one another over a joyful production". Lopez commented that the song is [...] "really about when love takes you by surprise — 'Ni Tú Ni Yo,' 'Not You, Not Me' really expected this to happen, you know? That's what it's about, it's {{one of those things}} that when love comes, it just comes, it doesn't announce itself, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> takes over — ha! — you know what I mean? That's what the song is about, which is why I love it so much." [...] She revealed that the song mirrored her own relationship with boyfriend Alex Rodriguez.|$|E
5000|$|... "Semi-Charmed Life", {{which sounds}} like easygoing pop, {{contains}} lyrics about a drug user's descent into crystal meth addiction. According to Jenkins, [...] "It's a dirty, filthy song about snorting speed and getting blow jobs." [...] He later explained that, [...] "It's about {{a time in}} my life when it seemed like all of my friends just sort of tapped out on speed." [...] He added that the song is [...] "bright and shiny on the surface, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> pulls you down in this lockjawed mess ... The music that I wrote for it is not intended to be bright and shiny for bright and shiny's sake. It's intended to be what the seductiveness of speed is like, represented in music." [...] The title, Jenkins said, [...] "refers to a life that's all propped up. You know, the beautiful people who lead bright and shiny lives that on the inside are all fucked up." ...|$|E
5000|$|Mellencamp said Sad Clowns & Hillbillies was {{borne out}} of his {{collaboration}} with Carter on Ghost Brothers of Darkland County and Ithaca.
