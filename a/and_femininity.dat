5|$|During {{his later}} {{creative}} years, Rodin's work turned increasingly toward the female form, and themes of more overt masculinity <b>and</b> <b>femininity.</b> He concentrated on small dance studies, and produced numerous erotic drawings, sketched {{in a loose}} way, without taking his pencil from the paper or {{his eyes from the}} model. Rodin met American dancer Isadora Duncan in 1900, attempted to seduce her, and the next year sketched studies of her and her students. In July 1906, Rodin was also enchanted by dancers from the Royal Ballet of Cambodia, and produced some of his most famous drawings from the experience.|$|E
5|$|Modern Shift: In today’s society, we are {{beginning}} to see a shift in gender representation in the media particularly in the male fashion industry. Fashion designers are now starting to blur the lines between masculinity <b>and</b> <b>femininity.</b> In the first advertisement, the male has a very soft delicate hold on the rose compared to the typical aggressive grip men exhibit in ads. In the other two examples, both men are not only portraying the idea of feminine touch but the concept of self-touch as well.|$|E

40|$|This {{essay is}} a {{contribution}} towards gaining conceptual clarity {{with regard to}} the task of understanding masculinities <b>and</b> <b>femininities,</b> especially in the Zimbabwean Shona context. Our argument is that masculinities <b>and</b> <b>femininities</b> in Zimbabwean Shona society have what we term in this essay a â€˜supraâ€™ dimension that is spiritual, and it is this supra dimension that we submit has not been given attention in critical discourses on masculinities <b>and</b> <b>femininities,</b> especially as exemplified by the concept of hegemonic masculinity. Contrary to the generalised conceptualisation of the human being as the centre of the universe and the source of knowledge, which is implied in most western social and cultural theories, Mutsvairo (1983) and Vera (1993), as this paper sets out to demonstrate, present us with an alternative view of the human being, which is in harmony with the Zimbabwean Shona cosmology. The Shona world view does not perceive the human being as the centre of the universe. The paper, therefore challenges this understanding and submits that spirituality as attested by Mutsvairo and Vera is a very important constituent of masculinities <b>and</b> <b>femininities...</b>|$|R

40|$|This article investigates lesbian gender {{identity}} {{as a number of}} possible performances of masculinities <b>and</b> <b>femininities.</b> Depending on the combination of masculinities <b>and</b> <b>femininities,</b> these identities can be placed alongside a continuum of lesbian gender expressions, with the extremes being female masculinity <b>and</b> female <b>femininity,</b> respectively. Two Afrikaans short stories, “Mamy Blue en ek onthou” (Welma Odendaal) and “Aan die einde van die reënboog” (Jeanne Goosen), are analysed according to this continuum to show that various manifestations of the lesbian subject exist. In these stories, five identities are postulated: the drag king, the stone butch, the Nike dyke, the straight-acting lesbian and the lipstick lesbian. This continuum-approach makes a reinterpretation of texts incorporating lesbian gender identities possible and stresses the various functions of such representations...|$|R

Focusing on women 2 ̆ 7 s communicative practices and social interactions yielded information about their efforts to successfully assimilate into the task and social contexts of their jobs. In order to enter and remain {{in this type of}} work environment, female workers have to carefully and consciously construct productive gender identities.

25|$|Cleavage is {{the exposed}} {{area of a}} dressed woman’s breasts lying over the sternum, and refers only to what is visible with {{clothing}} (or dense, nontransparent body art) that includes a low-cut neckline.

In these cultures women have, throughout history, sought to enhance their physical attractiveness <b>and</b> <b>femininity,</b> within the context of changing fashions and cultural-specific norms of modesty of the time and place. The methods practised in appropriate contexts have included the accentuation and partial display of breasts, including cleavage.

25|$|In total, 3,141 Canadian nurses volunteered their {{services}} for the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps.

40|$|In {{developed}} Western societies, it is {{well known}} that more men than women commit suicide each year, whereas women are more likely to be involved in suicide attempts. Despite these differences, public policies in the West have tended to treat gender as a descriptive, rather than causal, factor in suicidal behaviours. However, differences between socially constructed masculinities <b>and</b> <b>femininities</b> may impact on suicide-related behaviours and help explain gender differences in both behaviours and outcome. This literature review considers suicide through the lens of gender, drawing on a social constructionist perspective to explain differences between women and men in suicidal behaviour. In particular it focuses on individual and life history factors, social and community variables and living and working conditions. It will be argued that suicide-related behaviours, like health-behaviours more generally, are influenced by (and influence) demonstrations of masculinities <b>and</b> <b>femininities.</b> Finally, it will explore how a gendered view of suicidal behaviour will be of potential benefit to public health policies aimed at reducing gender differences in suicidal behaviour...|$|R

25|$|The festival has {{striking}} {{similarities to}} Confucian and Neo-Confucian ideals, {{in that it}} deals with filial piety. It has been observed that the account of rescuing the mother in hell has helped Buddhism to integrate into Chinese society. At the time, due to the Buddhist emphasis on the renunciant life, Buddhism was criticized by Confucianists. They felt Buddhism went against the principle of filial piety, because Buddhist monks did not have offspring to make offerings for ancestor worship. Maudgalyāyana's account helped greatly to improve this problem, and has therefore been raised as a textbook example of the adaptive qualities of Buddhism. Other scholars have proposed, however, that the position of Buddhism in India versus China was not all that different, as Buddhism {{had to deal with}} the problem of filial piety and renunciation in India as well. Another impact the story of Maudgalyāyana's had was that, in East Asia, the account helped to shift the emphasis of filial piety towards the mother, and helped redefine motherhood <b>and</b> <b>femininity.</b>|$|E
25|$|During the 1950s and '60s, psychologists began {{studying}} gender development in young children, partially {{in an effort}} to understand the origins of homosexuality (which was viewed as a mental disorder at the time). In 1958, the Gender Identity Research Project was established at the UCLA Medical Center for the study of intersex and transsexual individuals. Psychoanalyst Robert Stoller generalized many of the findings of the project in his book Sex and Gender: On the Development of Masculinity <b>and</b> <b>Femininity</b> (1968). He is also credited with introducing the term gender identity to the International Psychoanalytic Congress in Stockholm, Sweden in 1963. Behavioral psychologist John Money was also instrumental in the development of early theories of gender identity. His work at Johns Hopkins Medical School's Gender Identity Clinic (established in 1965) popularized an interactionist theory of gender identity, suggesting that, up to a certain age, gender identity is relatively fluid and subject to constant negotiation. His book Man and Woman, Boy and Girl (1972) became widely used as a college textbook, although many of Money's ideas have since been challenged.|$|E

25|$|Gender {{identity}} is one's personal experience of one's own gender. Gender identity can correlate with assigned sex at birth, or can differ from it completely. All societies {{have a set}} of gender categories that can serve as the basis of the formation of a person's social identity in relation to other members of society. In most societies, there is a basic division between gender attributes assigned to males and females, a gender binary to which most people adhere and which includes expectations of masculinity <b>and</b> <b>femininity</b> in all aspects of sex and gender: biological sex, gender identity, and gender expression. In all societies, some individuals do not identify with some (or all) of the aspects of gender that are assigned to their biological sex; In some cases, a person's gender {{identity is}} inconsistent with their biological sex characteristics (genitals and secondary sex characteristics), resulting in individuals dressing and/or behaving in a way which is perceived by others as outside cultural gender norms. These gender expressions may be described as gender variant, transgender, or genderqueer (there is an emerging vocabulary for those who defy traditional gender identity), and people who have such expressions may experience gender dysphoria (traditionally called Gender Identity Disorder or GID). Transgender individuals are greatly affected by language and gender pronouns before, during, and after their transition.|$|E
