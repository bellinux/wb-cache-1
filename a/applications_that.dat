5|$|A {{closely related}} problem, the minimax path problem, asks for {{the path that}} {{minimizes}} the maximum weight of any of its edges. It has <b>applications</b> <b>that</b> include transportation planning. Any algorithm for the widest path problem can be transformed into an algorithm for the minimax path problem, or vice versa, by reversing the sense of all the weight comparisons performed by the algorithm, or equivalently by replacing every edge weight by its negation.|$|E
5|$|Acid2 {{is a test}} page {{published}} and promoted by the Web Standards Project to expose web page rendering flaws in web browsers and other <b>applications</b> <b>that</b> render HTML. Named after the acid test for gold, it {{was developed in the}} spirit of Acid1, a relatively narrow test of compliance with the Cascading Style Sheets 1.0 (CSS1) standard, and was released on 13 April 2005. As with Acid1, an application passes the test if the way it displays the test page matches a reference image.|$|E

5|$|Beryllium oxide {{is useful}} for many <b>applications</b> <b>that</b> require the {{combined}} properties of an electrical insulator and an excellent heat conductor, with high strength and hardness, and a very high melting point. Beryllium oxide is frequently used as an insulator base plate in high-power transistors in radio frequency transmitters for telecommunications. Beryllium oxide is also being studied for use in increasing the thermal conductivity of uranium dioxide nuclear fuel pellets. Beryllium compounds were used in fluorescent lighting tubes, but this use was discontinued because of the disease berylliosis which developed in the workers who were making the tubes.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth has few {{commercial}} applications, {{and those}} <b>applications</b> <b>that</b> use it generally require small quantities {{relative to other}} raw materials. In the United States, for example, 884 tonnes of bismuth were consumed in 2010, of which 63% went into chemicals (including pharmaceuticals, pigments, and cosmetics); 26% into metallurgical additives for casting and galvanizing; 7% into bismuth alloys, solders and ammunition; and 4% into research and other uses.|$|E
5|$|FreeBSD has a {{software}} repository of over 26,000 <b>applications</b> <b>that</b> are developed by third parties. Examples include: windowing systems, web browsers, email clients, office suites and so forth. In general, the project {{itself does not}} develop this software, only the framework to allow these programs to be installed, which {{is known as the}} Ports collection. Applications may either be compiled from source ("ports"), provided their licensing terms allow this, or downloaded as pre-compiled binaries ("packages"). The Ports collection supports the current and stable branches of FreeBSD. Older releases are not supported and may or may not work correctly with an up-to-date Ports collection.|$|E

30|$|One {{important}} innovation {{potential is}} the combination of multiple approaches into a holistic process. An <b>application</b> <b>that</b> uses social rating in a semantically unsound way provides as little practical use as an <b>application</b> <b>that</b> is semantically sound but only classifies present information without explicitly looking at future implications.|$|R
5|$|In November 2013, IBM {{announced}} it would make Watson's API available to software application providers, enabling them to build apps and services that are embedded in Watson's capabilities. To build out its base of partners who create applications on the Watson platform, IBM consults with a network of venture capital firms, which advise IBM on which of their portfolio companies may be a logical fit for what IBM calls the Watson Ecosystem. Thus far, roughly 800 organizations and individuals have signed up with IBM, with interest in creating <b>applications</b> <b>that</b> could use the Watson platform.|$|E
5|$|Many fixed-speed {{motor load}} <b>applications</b> <b>that</b> are {{supplied}} direct from AC line power can save energy {{when they are}} operated at variable speed by means of VFD. Such energy cost savings are especially pronounced in variable-torque centrifugal fan and pump applications, where the load's torque and power vary with the square and cube, respectively, of the speed. This change gives a large power reduction compared to fixed-speed operation for a relatively small reduction in speed. For example, at 63% speed a motor load consumes only 25% of its full-speed power. This reduction is in accordance with affinity laws that define the relationship between various centrifugal load variables.|$|E
5|$|Most {{versions}} of Windows Mobile have a standard set of features, such as multitasking {{and the ability}} to navigate a file system similar to that of Windows 9x and Windows NT, including support for many of the same file types. Similarly to its desktop counterpart, it comes bundled with a set of <b>applications</b> <b>that</b> perform basic tasks. Internet Explorer Mobile is the default web browser, and Windows Media Player is the default media player used for playing digital media. The mobile version of Microsoft Office, is the default office suite.|$|E

5|$|Passive linear {{electronic}} analogue {{filters are}} those filters {{which can be}} described with linear differential equations (linear); they are composed of capacitors, inductors and, sometimes, resistors (passive) and are designed to operate on continuously varying (analogue) signals. There are many linear filters which are not analogue in implementation (digital filter), {{and there are many}} electronic filters which may not have a passive topology both of which may have the same transfer function of the filters described in this article. Analogue filters are most often used in wave filtering <b>applications,</b> <b>that</b> is, where it is required to pass particular frequency components and to reject others from analogue (continuous-time) signals.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{requiring}} all desired functionality to be {{built into}} the language's core, Python {{was designed to be}} highly extensible. Python can also be embedded in existing <b>applications</b> <b>that</b> need a programmable interface. This design of a small core language with a large standard library and an easily extensible interpreter was intended by Van Rossum from the start because of his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite mindset.|$|E
5|$|The {{demand for}} iridium surged from 2.5 tonnes in 2009 to 10.4 tonnes in 2010, {{mostly because of}} electronics-related <b>applications</b> <b>that</b> saw a rise from 0.2 to 6 tonnes â€“ iridium {{crucibles}} are commonly used for growing large high-quality single crystals, demand for which has increased sharply. This increase in iridium consumption is predicted to saturate due to accumulating stocks of crucibles, as happened earlier in the 2000s. Other major applications include spark plugs that consumed 0.78 tonnes of iridium in 2007, electrodes for the chloralkali process (1.1 t in 2007) and chemical catalysts (0.75 t in 2007).|$|E

5|$|The single-instruction-single-data (SISD) {{classification}} {{is equivalent}} to an entirely sequential program. The single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) classification is analogous to doing the same operation repeatedly over a large data set. This is commonly done in signal processing applications. Multiple-instruction-single-data (MISD) is a rarely used classification. While computer architectures {{to deal with this}} were devised (such as systolic arrays), few <b>applications</b> <b>that</b> fit this class materialized. Multiple-instruction-multiple-data (MIMD) programs are by far {{the most common type of}} parallel programs.|$|E
5|$|During the {{preliminary}} hearing in late July, prosecutors presented testimonies from Jew's neighbors at both of his homes, indicating that Jew had never lived in his 28th Avenue house {{and spent most of}} his time in Burlingame. Testimony from a U.S. Postal Service inspector revealed that Jew's first-class mail went to Burlingame while junk mail went to his San Francisco address; prosecutors cited utility bills showing low usage of water and electricity at his 28th Avenue home, as well as loan <b>applications</b> <b>that</b> indicated he lived in Burlingame. In his defense, Jew produced a jury duty summons to indicate his address in San Francisco, and questioned the possible bias of the witnesses against him.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, Juniper {{released}} the EX9200 switch, which isn't {{part of the}} MX Series, but uses the same software and Trio chipset. A virtualized MX series 3D router, the vMX 3D, was introduced in November 2014. A suite of updates were announced in late 2015. New MPC line cards were introduced, which have a throughput of up to 1.6 Tbit/s. Simultaneously the Juniper Extension Toolkit (JET) was announced. JET is a programming interface for integrating third-party <b>applications</b> <b>that</b> automate provisioning, maintenance and other tasks. The Junos Telemetry Interface was also announced at the same time. It reports data to applications and other equipment to automate changes to the network in response to faults or in order optimize performance.|$|E
