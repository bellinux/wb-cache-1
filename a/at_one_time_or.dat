Other well-known flotillas in Norway included the 13th and 14th Flotillas.|$|E

5|$|Myers {{made his}} own electrical-mechanical {{apparatuses}} and tools. He turned his interests, hobbies and experiments into early entrepreneurial ventures that earned money for him. He became <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>time</b> <b>or</b> another a delivery agent, bill collector, bank clerk, carpenter, chemist, electrician, gas-fitter, mechanic, photographer, plumber, printer, telegrapher, and writer.|$|E

5|$|Although {{it could}} not be {{considered}} a large air arm in the wider context of World War II, the ZNDH nonetheless had on its charge <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>time</b> <b>or</b> another some 650 aircraft between April 1941 and May 1945, as well as anti-aircraft and paratroop units. From humble beginnings in 1941, the ZNDH was still providing some measure of air-support (fighter, attack and transport) until the last days of World War II in Europe.|$|E

50|$|Bomber {{aircraft}} can {{release all}} of their bombs <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>time</b> ("salvo") <b>or</b> drop individual bombs at intervals. If the bombardier selects the latter, he can program an intervalometer to control the pace at which the bombs are released. This, of course, determines how far apart they will land in the target area.|$|R
5|$|Below is {{a summary}} of the titles/positions held, <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>time</b> <b>or</b> another, by the 53 {{individuals}} depicted on United States banknotes from 1861 to the present. The list of positions is not exhaustive, but does address the central elected federal and state officials, members of the President’s cabinet, military figureheads, and several of the founders and framers of the United States government.|$|E
5|$|Other dams have impeded fish passage <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>time</b> <b>or</b> another {{between the}} William L. Jess Dam and Grants Pass. After decades of {{controversy}} about water rights, costs, migratory fish, and environmental impacts, removal or modification of remaining middle-reach dams {{as well as}} a partly finished dam on Elk Creek, a major tributary of the Rogue, began in 2008. The de-construction projects were all meant to improve salmon runs by allowing more fish to reach suitable spawning grounds.|$|E
5|$|The 19th-century {{historian}} Theodor Mommsen compiled {{and described}} in detail the various elements that <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>time</b> <b>or</b> another have been asserted as elements within the ritualistic execution of a parricide during the Roman Era. The following paragraph is based on that description, {{it is not to}} be regarded as a static ritual that always was observed, but as a descriptive enumeration of elements gleaned from several sources written {{over a period of several}} centuries. Mommsen, for example, notes that the monkey hardly can have been an ancient element in the execution ritual.|$|E

The University of Pittsburgh, adjacent to the park, also uses the panther as its mascot. <b>At</b> <b>one</b> <b>time,</b> painting <b>or</b> defacing the Moretti sculptures was a popular form of vandalism committed by the fans of rival universities prior to the schools' football games.|$|R

5|$|The U.S. was {{motivated}} {{by the desire to}} buy time for its withdrawal from Southeast Asia, to protect its ally in South Vietnam, and {{to prevent the spread of}} communism to Cambodia. American and both South and North Vietnamese forces directly participated (<b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>time</b> <b>or</b> another) in the fighting. The U.S. assisted the central government with massive U.S. aerial bombing campaigns and direct material and financial aid.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the boys}} at St. Mary's played {{baseball}} in organized leagues {{at different levels of}} proficiency. Ruth later estimated that he played 200 games a year as he steadily climbed the ladder of success. Although he played all positions <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>time</b> <b>or</b> another (including infield positions generally reserved for right-handers), he gained stardom as a pitcher. According to Brother Matthias, Ruth was standing to one side laughing at the bumbling pitching efforts of fellow students, and Matthias told him to go in and see if he could do better. Ruth had become the best pitcher at St. Mary's, and when he was 18 in 1913, he was allowed to leave the premises to play weekend games on teams that were drawn from the community. He was mentioned in several newspaper articles, for both his pitching prowess and ability to hit long home runs.|$|E
50|$|The {{settlement}} name of Ellison {{was adopted}} 1 December 1955, and {{is named after}} Price Ellison (1852-1932), a stock raiser and wheat grower that settled here in 1876, and <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>time</b> owned <b>or</b> controlled 80% of the property in the area. The Ellison Post Office was opened 1 May 1912, with Thomas Clinton as postmaster, and closed 15 May 1920.|$|R

50|$|According to A. Leo Oppenheim, {{the corpus}} of {{cuneiform}} literature amounted to around 1,500 texts <b>at</b> any <b>one</b> <b>time</b> <b>or</b> place, {{approximately half of}} which, {{at least from the}} first millennium, is extant in fragmentary form, and the most common genres included (in order of predominance) are omen texts, lexical lists, ritual incantations, cathartic and apotropaic conjurations, historical and mythological epics, fables and proverbs.|$|R
50|$|The Ikelan (Éklan/Ikelan or Ibenheren in Tamasheq; Bouzou in Hausa; Bella in Songhai; {{singular}} Akli) are a caste within Tuareg society, {{who were}} <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>time</b> slaves <b>or</b> servile communities. While the Ikelan now {{speak the same}} language as the Tuareg nobles and share many customs, they are of assimilated Nilotic origin rather than of Berber heritage like the ethnic Tuareg. They also often live in communities separated from other castes.|$|R

40|$|The n-stage {{harvesting}} {{strategy of}} Elizarov and Svirezhev is examined. As a result, some important new features appear. A discussion is presented {{on whether or}} not one should harvest a species <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>time</b> stage <b>or</b> wait until a later time. The paper is concerned with contributions which are primarily mathematical formulations and results for continuous, as well as discrete time, logistic growth of a single species being harvested. Age class structure is ignored...|$|R
5|$|Antonmaria di Noldo Gherardini, Lisa's father, {{had lost}} two wives, Lisa di Giovanni Filippo de' Carducci, whom he married in 1465, and Caterina di Mariotto Rucellai, whom he married in 1473. Both died in childbirth. Lisa's mother was Lucrezia del Caccia, {{daughter}} of Piera Spinelli, and Gherardini's wife by his third marriage in 1476. Gherardini <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>time</b> owned <b>or</b> rented six farms in Chianti that produced wheat, wine {{and olive oil}} and where livestock was raised.|$|R
40|$|We study {{caterpillar}} tree automata [3] {{that are}} restricted to enter any subtree <b>at</b> most <b>one</b> <b>time</b> (<b>or</b> k <b>times).</b> We show that, somewhat surprisingly, the deterministic one-visit automata can already, for instance, evaluate trees where the nodes represent some non-associative operations. We show that there exist regular tree languages that cannot be accepted by a one-visit automaton, thus proving a weakened form of a conjecture of Br 7 ̆fuggemann-Klein and Wood [3]. We establish that the k-visit property is decidable...|$|R
