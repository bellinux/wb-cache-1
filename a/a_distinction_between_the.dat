5|$|Next Stace {{explains}} {{that there are}} two orders of being: time (or the world) and eternity (or God), and these intersect in the moment of mystic illumination. He maintains these orders are distinct, so one order cannot dictate to the other. Here he says that he agrees with Kant, who made <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> world of phenomena and the noumenon, although he is critical of Kant’s disregard for mystical experience.|$|E
5|$|The most {{enduring}} Roman legacy {{may be that}} created by Hadrian's Wall. Its line approximates the border between modern Scotland and England and it created <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> northern third and southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain that plays a part in modern political debate. This is probably coincidental however, as {{there is little to}} suggest its influence {{played an important role in}} the early Medieval period after the fall of Rome.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the Enlightenment, {{the gospels}} were usually {{regarded}} as accurate historical accounts, {{but since then}} scholars have emerged who question {{the reliability of the}} gospels and draw <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Jesus described in the gospels and the Jesus of history. Since the 18th century, three separate scholarly quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during the quest that applied them. While there is widespread scholarly agreement on the existence of Jesus, and a basic consensus on the general outline of his life, the portraits of Jesus constructed by various scholars often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospel accounts.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{word order}} is subject–object–verb, like Latin and Japanese. Like other Niger–Congo languages, {{it has a}} noun class system, with nouns {{classified}} according to five different classes, which also affects pronouns, adjectives and copulas. The phonology features <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> length of vowels and whether they are oral or nasal (as in French or Portuguese). There are also three distinct tones, a feature shared with the other Senufo languages. Nafaanra grammar features both tense and aspect which are marked with particles. Numbers are mainly formed by adding cardinal numbers to the number 5 and by multiplying the numbers 10, 20 and 100.|$|E
5|$|Wheelchair: The {{earliest}} {{records of}} wheeled furniture are an inscription {{found on a}} stone slate in China and a child’s bed depicted in a frieze on a Greek vase, both dating between the 6th and 5th century BCE. The first records of wheeled seats being used for transporting disabled people date to three centuries later in China; the Chinese used early wheelbarrows to move {{people as well as}} heavy objects. <b>A</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two functions was not made until around 525 CE, when images of wheeled chairs made specifically to carry people begin to occur in Chinese art.|$|E

50|$|In rhetoric, protrepsis (πρότρεψις) and paraenesis (παραίνεσις) are two {{closely related}} styles of exhortation that are {{employed}} by moral philosophers. While there is <b>a</b> widely accepted <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two that is employed by modern writers, classical philosophers {{did not make}} <b>a</b> clear <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two, and even used them interchangeably.|$|R
5|$|During the English Civil War, {{the members}} of the Long Parliament {{realised}} that the use of county militia organised into regional associations (such as the Eastern Association), often commanded by local members of parliament (both from the House of Commons and the House of Lords), while more than able to hold their own in the regions which Parliamentarians controlled, were unlikely to win the war. So Parliament initiated two actions. The Self-denying Ordinance, with the notable exception of Oliver Cromwell, forbade members of parliament from serving as officers in the Parliamentary armies. This created <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> civilians in Parliament, who tended to be Presbyterian and conciliatory to the Royalists in nature, and a corps of professional officers, who tended to Independent politics, to whom they reported. The second action was legislation {{for the creation of a}} Parliamentary-funded army, commanded by Lord General Thomas Fairfax, which became known as the New Model Army (originally new-modelled Army).|$|E

25|$|Zoophilia is a {{paraphilia}} {{involving a}} sexual fixation on non-human animals. Bestiality is cross-species sexual activity between human and non-human animals. The terms {{are often used}} interchangeably, but some researchers make <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> attraction (zoophilia) and the act (bestiality).|$|E
25|$|In matrix multiplication, {{there is}} <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> cross and the dot symbols.

25|$|Because {{of these}} {{differences}} in the building blocks, some block copolymer micelles behave like surfactant ones, while others don't. It is necessary therefore to make <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two situations.

25|$|Seeking {{to defend}} the {{assertion}} that humans can become like God through deification without compromising God's transcendence, Palamas distinguished between God's inaccessible essence and the energies through which he becomes known and enables to share his divine life. The central idea of the Palamite theology is <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> divine essence and the divine energies {{that is not a}} merely conceptual distinction.|$|E
25|$|Holidays {{celebrating the}} arrival of the Magi {{traditionally}} recognise <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> date of their arrival and the date of Jesus' birth. The account given in the Gospel of Matthew does not state that they were present {{on the night of the}} birth; in the Gospel of Luke, Joseph and Mary remain in Bethlehem until it is time for Jesus' dedication, in Jerusalem, and then return to their home in Nazareth.|$|E

25|$|In mechanics, Ibn Sīnā, in The Book of Healing, {{developed}} {{a theory of}} motion, in which he made <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> inclination (tendency to motion) and force of a projectile, and concluded that motion {{was a result of}} an inclination (mayl) transferred to the projectile by the thrower, and that projectile motion in a vacuum would not cease. He viewed inclination as a permanent force whose effect is dissipated by external forces such as air resistance.|$|E
25|$|Trespass and trover {{were both}} actions founded upon possession. For many centuries, they were {{alternative}} remedies for the wrongful taking of, or damage to chattels. There was <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> actions. In {{the theory of}} trespass, the plaintiff remained {{the owner of the}} chattel, with the possession or property rights interrupted or interfered with. In this case, the plaintiff must accept the chattel back when it was tendered. Recovery was limited to any damage to the chattel, or from the interruption of property rights.|$|E
25|$|By the Middle Ages {{large parts}} of the {{population}} of the Low Countries lived in urbanized centers. These towns and large villages were the carriers of and the centers for self-recognition of Dutch culture. Art and poetry began to emerge, establishing <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Dutch and other peoples, in particular the French. These urban centers formed out of a realization that cooperation was necessary for survival. Individuals joined together to form communities, and in so doing gave up personal interests and subjugated themselves to local law.|$|E
