Marketed as Unimog U82 and later Unimog U110, 64,242 of the two Unimog 404 types 404.0 and 404.1 were built, which makes the 404 the Unimog model with the highest production figure of all Unimogs.

50|$|A vehicle bus is a {{specialized}} internal communications network that interconnects components inside a vehicle (e.g. automobile, bus, train, industrial or <b>agricultural</b> <b>vehicle,</b> ship, or aircraft). Special requirements for vehicle control such as assurance of message delivery, of non-conflicting messages, of minimum time of delivery, of low cost, and of EMF noise resilience, {{as well as}} redundant routing and other characteristics mandate the use of less common networking protocols. Protocols include Controller Area Network (CAN), Local Interconnect Network (LIN) and others. Conventional computer networking technologies (such as Ethernet and TCP/IP) are rarely used, except in aircraft, where implementations of the ARINC 664 such as the Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet are used. Aircraft that use AFDX include the B787, the A400M and the A380.|$|E

5000|$|The Sankot Motor Company, {{also known}} as the Sankot Garage, is a {{historic}} building located in Belle Plaine, Iowa, United States. The historical significance of this building is its association with the increase in all-season travel and the development of businesses to serve them along the Lincoln Highway, the United States's first transcontinental route. [...] It is a brick front building with side walls of clay tile that was constructed on a concrete foundation. The west half of the building was added in 1927. It was operated by O.B. Charles and Sid Sankot until 1937. They also sold Chryslers. Gasoline was sold from 1920 to 1944. F.L. Sankot bought the business in 1937. In addition to vehicle repair he sold Case and Oliver tractors and implements. William and Jerry Sankot purchased the business in 1985, and limited it to passenger, commercial and <b>agricultural</b> <b>vehicle</b> repairs. [...] The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. [...] It was included as a contributing property in the Belle Plaine Main Street Historic District in 2013.|$|E
5000|$|Once on the ground, the {{aircraft}} {{had to be}} retrieved by a Scheuch-Schlepper, a converted small <b>agricultural</b> <b>vehicle,</b> originally based {{on the concept of}} the two-wheel tractor, carrying a detachable third swiveling wheel at the extreme rear of its design for stability in normal use—this swiveling third wheel was replaced with a pivoting, special retrieval trailer that rolled on a pair of short, triple-wheeled continuous track setups (one per side) for military service wherever the Komet was based. This retrieval trailer usually possessed twin trailing lifting arms, that lifted the stationary aircraft off the ground from under each wing whenever it was not already on its twin-wheel [...] "dolly" [...] main gear, as when {{the aircraft}} had landed on its ventral skid and tailwheel after a mission. Another form of trailer, known also to have been trialled with the later B-series examples, was tried during the Komets test phase, which used a pair of sausage-shaped air bags in place of the lifting arms and could also be towed by the Scheuch-Schlepper tractor, inflating the air bags to lift the aircraft. The three-wheeled Scheuch-Schlepper tractor used for the task was originally meant for farm use, but such a vehicle with a specialized trailer was required as the Komet was unpowered after exhausting its rocket propellants, and lacked main wheels after landing, from the jettisoning of its [...] "dolly" [...] main gear at takeoff. The slightly larger Sd Kfz 2 Kettenkrad half-track motorcycle, known to be used with the Me 262 jet fighter for ground handling needs, and documented as also being used with the Arado Ar 234B jet recon-bomber, was not known to have ever been used for ground handling operations with the Komet at any time.|$|E
