40|$|<b>Adaptogens</b> were {{initially}} defined as substances that enhance the “state of nonspecific resistance” in stress, a physiological condition that is linked with various disorders of the neuroendocrine-immune system. Studies on animals and isolated neuronal cells {{have revealed that}} <b>adaptogens</b> exhibit neuroprotective, anti-fatigue, antidepressive, anxiolytic, nootropic and CNS stimulating activity. In addition, a number of clinical trials demonstrate that <b>adaptogens</b> exert an anti-fatigue effect that increases mental work capacity {{against a background of}} stress and fatigue, particularly in tolerance to mental exhaustion and enhanced attention. Indeed, recent pharmacological studies of a number of <b>adaptogens</b> have provided a rationale for these effects also at the molecular level. It was discovered that the stress—protective activity of <b>adaptogens</b> was associated with regulation of homeostasis via several mechanisms of action, which was linked with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the regulation of key mediators of stress response, such as molecular chaperons (e. g., HSP 70), stress-activated c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase 1 (JNK 1), Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factor DAF- 16, cortisol and nitric oxide...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} found empirically that some plants, such as Eleutherococcus senticosus, Rhodiola rosea, Schizandra chinensis and Bryonia alba etc, used in {{traditional}} medicine to increase stamina and general well-being, also increase the state of non-specific resistance in stress. These plants have been named <b>adaptogens</b> and are defined as metabolic regulators that reduce the damaging effects of various stressors by virtue of a reduction of the reactivity of the host defence system. <b>Adaptogens</b> increase {{the ability of the}} organism to cope with stress, thus implying a curative effect on stress-induced disorders. Such drugs are often classified as preparations which stimulate the central nervous system (CNS) in manuals and handbooks on pharmacology. However, <b>adaptogens</b> differ in significant ways from classical CNS-stimulants. Experiments on frogs show that <b>adaptogens</b> do not have direct anti-narcotic effects on the CNS unlike other stimulants such as phenamine, caffeine etc. The mechanisms of action of <b>adaptogens</b> are related to the regulation of the stress system – neuroendocrine – immune complex, and are associated with the biochemical adaptation of cells and organisms to stress. A large number of uncontrolled as well as placebo-controlled, randomised, double-blind clinical studies have shown that standardised extracts of E. senticosus, R. rosea and S. chinensis are efficient at increasing mental and physical work capacity in situations of fatigue and stress, {{as well as in the}} treatment of some psychiatric disorders such as neurosis, psychogenic depression, astheno-depressive states, alcoholism etc. Comparing the concept of quality of life with the concept of <b>adaptogens,</b> it is suggested that that this group of botanicals could be useful in improving the quality of life in many categories of patients and even in healthy subjects.

The aim of this literature review is to summarize and critically analyze research conducted on the adaptogenic herbs. The aim of this review article is to assess the level of scientific evidence presented by the <b>adaptogens</b> from natural origin by different screening methods and to provide a rationale at the molecular level. Strong scientific evidence is available in relation with the molecular mechanisms associated with their stress- protective activity against acute and chronic paradigms. The beneficial stress- protective effect of <b>adaptogens</b> is in relation with regulation of homeostasis via several mechanisms of action associated with the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal axis and the control of key stress mediators and biochemical markers such as nitric oxide (NO), cortisol, cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose etc. Good scientific evidence has been documented with active secondary metabolites present in <b>adaptogens...</b>|$|R

The progestogenic herbs, Rehmannia, Bupleurum, and Coleus forskohlii all belong to a class of <b>adaptogens</b> that support the proper progesterone producing function of the adrenal glands in both genders. Herbs which mimic other actions of progesterone (including healthy neurological function) complement the phytoprogesterones and progestogenic herbs.

50|$|Nicandra physalodes {{contains}} nicandrenones, a {{group of}} the steroidal lactones known as withanolides. The nicandrenones, like certain other types of withanolide, have insecticidal properties. 30 years after their discovery, the first total synthesis of nicandrenones {{was carried out in}} the year 2000.Amongst its other paradoxical attributes, N. physalodes is also slightly intoxicating, showing a certain degree of psychoactivity of a type similar to that elicited by the tropane alkaloid hyoscyamine (well {{known as one of the}} active principles present in the notoriously toxic nightshades Hyoscyamus niger and Atropa belladonna and causing mydriasis - a symptom said also to be caused by the alkaloids present in Nicandra).This property of the plant is reflected in one of the common names given it in France (namely belladonne de pays i.e. 'country belladonna') and likewise in the common name belladona given it in Bolivia. It is not yet known whether this mild psychoactivity is referable to the alkaloid content or the withanolide content (or possibly to both - or indeed a synergy between the two). Like its more toxic relatives, Nicandra physalodes is alkaloidal, analyses having revealed the presence of the tropane alkaloid tropinone and the pyrrolidine alkaloid hygrine (0.1%, in the root). Withanolides are found almost exclusively in plants of the Solanaceae and, while it is noticeable that many psychoactive species belonging to that family contain only, or primarily, such compounds, not a single withanolide has yet been proven to be psychoactive. The compounds are named for the Solanaceous genus Withania, the best-known species of which, Withania somnifera, is, as its specific name suggests, mildly psychoactive to the extent of being sleep-inducing (among other useful medicinal properties). The use of W.somnifera (common name (i.a.) 'Indian ginseng') as a tonic (<b>adaptogen)</b> in Ayurvedic medicine parallels the use of Nicandra as an <b>adaptogen</b> in traditional Tibetan medicine (see above, under 'Uses') and is accounted for by withanolide content. Also present in Nicandra are calystegines, a new group of polyhydroxy alkaloids with a nortropane skeleton and named for the bindweed genus Calystegia (Convolvulaceae). Their occurrence has been noted in several species of the Solanaceae, including Atropa belladonna. The biosynthesis of these compounds is thought to take place via the tropane alkaloid pathway, the first metabolite being pseudotropine.|$|E
