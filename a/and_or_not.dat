25|$|Windows Search {{queries are}} {{specified}} in Advanced Query Syntax (AQS) which supports not only simple text searches but provides advanced property-based query operations as well. AQS defines certain keywords {{which can be}} used to refine the search query, such as specifying boolean operations on searched terms (<b>AND,</b> <b>OR,</b> <b>NOT)</b> as well as to specify further filters based on file metadata or file type. It {{can also be used to}} limit results from specific information stores like regular files, offline files cache, or email stores. File type specific operators are available as well. WDS also supports wildcard prefix matching searches. It also includes several SQL-like operators like GROUP BY. AQS is locale dependent and uses different keywords in international versions of Windows 7.|$|E

50|$|While {{some of the}} {{familiar}} rules of arithmetic algebra continue to hold in the algebra of propositions (e.g. the commutative and associative laws for <b>AND</b> <b>and</b> <b>OR),</b> some do <b>not</b> (e.g. the distributive laws for <b>AND,</b> <b>OR</b> <b>and</b> <b>NOT).</b>|$|R

5000|$|To this end, {{replacements}} for basic operators <b>AND,</b> <b>OR,</b> <b>NOT</b> must be available. There {{are several ways}} to this. A common replacement is called the Zadeh operators: ...|$|E
50|$|Conditions {{may include}} equalities, and inequalities of expressions. Conditions {{may also be}} {{combined}} using <b>AND,</b> <b>OR,</b> <b>NOT.</b> Expressions include column names, constants, and standard arithmetic operations over them.|$|E
50|$|Modern digital {{computers}} perform computations {{based upon}} digital logic operations implemented {{at the lowest}} level as logic gates. There are essentially seven basic logic functions implemented as logic gates: <b>AND,</b> <b>OR,</b> <b>NOT,</b> NAND, NOR, XOR and XNOR.|$|E

5000|$|Boolean {{operations}} on polygons are {{a set of}} Boolean operations (<b>AND,</b> <b>OR,</b> <b>NOT,</b> XOR, ...) operating on one or more sets of polygons in computer graphics. These sets of operations are widely used in computer graphics, CAD, and in EDA (in integrated circuit physical design and verification software).|$|E
50|$|In logical circuits, {{a simple}} adder {{can be made}} with an XOR gate to add the numbers, and a series of <b>AND,</b> <b>OR</b> <b>and</b> <b>NOT</b> gates to create the carry output.|$|R

50|$|Unlike in Integer BASIC and Applesoft II, the Boolean {{operators}} <b>AND,</b> <b>OR</b> <b>and</b> <b>NOT</b> perform bitwise {{operations on}} 16-bit integer values. If {{they are given}} values outside that range, an error results.|$|R
50|$|The Arithmetic and Logic Unit is {{responsible}} for performing boolean operations (<b>and,</b> <b>or,</b> <b>not,</b> nand, nor, xor, xnor) and also for performing integer addition and subtraction. Besides the result, the ALU typically provides status bits such as {{whether or not the}} result was 0, or if an overflow occurred.|$|E
50|$|There are {{multiple}} methods {{for building a}} computing device based on DNA, {{each with its own}} advantages and disadvantages. Most of these build the basic logic gates (<b>AND,</b> <b>OR,</b> <b>NOT)</b> associated with digital logic from a DNA basis. Some of the different bases include DNAzymes, deoxyoligonucleotides, enzymes, toehold exchange.|$|E
50|$|Brushing and linking with logical {{combination}} of brushes {{is a more}} advanced form of IVA. This {{makes it possible for}} the user to mark several areas in one or several views and combine these areas with the logical operators: <b>and,</b> <b>or,</b> <b>not.</b> This makes it is possible to explore deeper into the dataset and see more hidden information. A simple example would be the analysis of weather data: The analyst might want to discover regions that both have warm temperatures and low precipitation.|$|E

5000|$|Major search engines: Using boolean {{operators}} (<b>AND,</b> <b>OR,</b> <b>NOT,</b> etc.), related search syntax (parentheses for clauses, {{quotation marks}} around multiple-keyword phrases, etc.) and appropriate special commands (intitle:, inurl:, site:, filetype:, etc.), one can generate very targeted search strings to find just {{the kinds of}} candidate resumes and/or prospect biographies desired. These are typically most effective on major engines such as Google, Yahoo, Live, Exalead, etc., that each have billions of pages indexed as well as support for many special commands.|$|E
50|$|A {{subset of}} {{statements}} in the Verilog language are synthesizable. Verilog modules that conform to a synthesizable coding style, known as RTL (register-transfer level), can be physically realized by synthesis software. Synthesis software algorithmically transforms the (abstract) Verilog source into a netlist, a logically equivalent description consisting only of elementary logic primitives (<b>AND,</b> <b>OR,</b> <b>NOT,</b> flip-flops, etc.) that are available in a specific FPGA or VLSI technology. Further manipulations to the netlist ultimately lead to a circuit fabrication blueprint (such as a photo mask set for an ASIC or a bitstream file for an FPGA).|$|E
50|$|There is {{a trivial}} lower bound of Ω(n) for {{multiplying}} two n-bit numbers {{on a single}} processor; no matching algorithm (on conventional Turing machines) nor any better lower bound is known. Multiplication lies outside of AC0p for any prime p, meaning there is no family of constant-depth, polynomial (or even subexponential) size circuits using <b>AND,</b> <b>OR,</b> <b>NOT,</b> and MODp gates that can compute a product. This follows from a constant-depth reduction of MODq to multiplication. Lower bounds for multiplication are also known for some classes of branching programs.|$|E
