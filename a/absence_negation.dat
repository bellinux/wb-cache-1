40|$|This paper {{presents}} an alternative view on disjunctive logic program: Disjunctive program = Control program + Horn program. For this we introduce a program transformation which transforms a disjunctive logic program into a Horn {{program and a}} so called control program. The control program consists of only disjunctions of new propositional atoms and controls the iexecutionj of the Horn program. The relationship between original and transformed programs is established by using circumscription. Based on this relationship a new minimal model reasoning approach is developed. Due to the transformation it is straightforward to incorporate SLD-resolution into the proof procedure. 1 Introduction Disjunctive logic programs may contain denite or indenite information which reAEects human limitation in understanding the world being modelled.

The Prāsaṅgika argue that when attempting to find the correct object of understanding - which is a mere <b>absence</b> or mere <b>negation</b> of impossible modes of existence - one should not use positivist statements about the nature of reality.

Whether through the complete <b>absence</b> and <b>negation</b> of authorship, as in Sherrie Levine's work, the predominant physical presence of Cindy Sherman or Barbara Kruger's brilliant interplay of text and image, all three of these women reflected and critiqued America's male-centric art culture, thereby attempting to engage and challenge a reconstruction of the preconceived notions involved in the act of viewing.

The underlying consideration depends on the three basic desirable aspects of visual representation viz. simplicity, visual clarity and expressiveness [9]. For incorporation of constants in diagrams we discuss Venn-i (2004), Swoboda’s diagrams (2005) and Spider diagrams with constants (2005). We also discuss representation of negation in these diagrams. To depict negation in Venn-i the concept of absence is brought in from the conceptual schema of Indian philosophy. The advantage of Venn-i over spider diagram is discussed. The notion of absence naturally calls for {{the concept of an}} open universe. A brief discussion on open universe is presented at the end.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore whether Twitter data {{can be used in}} dialectological studies of morphosyntactic alternations in Peninsular Spanish. Specifically, drawing on a corpus of tweets we {{evaluate}} the hypothesis that in Peninsular Spanish, as in Caribbean Spanish, the pluralization of presentational haber (e. g., Había(n) fiestas ‘there were parties’) is constrained by two domain-general cognitive constraints on language production: markedness of coding and statistical preemption. Then, we analyze the geographic distribution of haber pluralization in Peninsular Spanish. The results show that haber is pluralized in 11 % (N= 611 / 5, 500) of the cases. The mixed-effects logistic regression analysis supports that nouns which can easily be imagined as starting points of a series of events, the <b>absence</b> of <b>negation,</b> and verb tenses other than the preterit favor pluralization. To explore the geographic distribution of haber pluralization in Peninsular Spanish, we use a generalized additive mixed model, which generates a line that runs approximately from Lérida in the north of Spain to Almería in the south, crossing Teruel and Albacete. East of that line, the pluralized variant has a higher probability of occurrence, but it is not absent from other areas of the Peninsula. We conclude that (i) haber pluralization in Peninsular Spanish is constrained by domain-general cognitive constraints on language production and that (ii) tweets constitute a viable alternative to spoken language data in dialectological studies of morphosyntactic variation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A {{difficult}} {{aspect to}} put into context, color is not of secondary importance, but rather is of primary consideration {{in the design of}} a building as to how it will be perceived, starting with its facade. White as a color (whether the sum of all colors or their very <b>absence</b> and <b>negation)</b> seems to have been the preferred choice of architects throughout the ages. It was determined by the materials in use but also for cultural-symbolic reasons. White was mistakenly believed to be “the color” of Classical Antiquity, but only because of the decay of time and the loss of pigments that characterized, for example, the pediment in Classical temples. That’s why it was considered particularly suited for expressing the ideal of formal perfection, beginning with the Renaissance, continuing with the Baroque, Neo-Palladianism, Neo-Classicism, as well as the architecture of the fascist period. So rare in Antiquity and in the Middle Ages, eras characterized by a tendency for a more or less insistent use of polychromy, in which white was just one of many possible colors, the monochrome modality becomes a growing option. However long seen as a reference to Classical Antiquity, and from a philological point of view due to the Modernist movement the negation of historical truth or the recognition of color as aesthetic error, white has risen as a contemporary symbol. It is considered on the one hand perfect for expressing a neutral state which doesn’t speak but is spoken about, allowing its context or content to emerge. While on the other hand it is perfect for the search for other dimensions outside of time and the surrounding space...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAs {{discussed}} by Spitz (1957), first negative constructions {{seem to take}} over from early gestures of rejection and avoidance (Clark 1978). For Kendon (2002), in many cultures, gestures of negation are the ritualization of spontaneous actions. Guidetti (2005) argues that gestures of agreement and refusal are the first symbolic gestures (aside from pointing) used by children. In order to trace the transitions between actions and gestures and between gestures and verbal productions in children's data, we analyzed all the actions, gestures, vocal and verbal productions of five speaking monolingual and bilingual children from the ages of 0; 10 to 4; 0. We were particularly interested in a) trying to distinguish actions (pushing an object away, avoiding a spoonful of broccoli), and conventional gestures with headshakes or the index; b) the combined use of gestures and words; c) the use of each modality on its own; d) the introduction of co-verbal gestures {{at the end of}} the data. We also analyzed what the first functions of <b>negation</b> were (rejection/refusal, <b>absence,</b> epistemic <b>negation,</b> negative assertion) their order of emergence and their forms in different modalities from the very beginning of our data. Our study shows that the five children use the two modalities throughout the data for all functions of negation, but with very great individual differences. Some children seem to follow a path that leads them from actions to symbolic gestures in isolation and then combine them with words before they make verbal productions alone. Other children are very quick at entering the verbal modality and do not rely on symbolic gestures. But the visual-gestural modality makes a spectacular comeback in all five children's data with the use of co-verbal gestures of negation when speech seems to be already quite elaborate.

40|$|Synchronic {{variability}} {{in the area of}} phonetics, phonology, vocabulary, morphology and syntax is a natural feature of any language, including English. The existence of competing variants is in itself a fascinating phenomenon, {{but it is also a}} prerequisite for diachronic changes. This volume is a collection of studies which investigate variability from a contemporary and historical perspective, in both native and non-native varieties of English. The topics include Middle English spelling variation, lexical differences between Middle English dialects, Late Middle and Early Modern English forms of address, Middle English negation patterns, the English used by Polish immigrants living in London, lexical fixedness in native and non-native English used by Polish learners, and the phenomenon of phonetic imitation in Polish learners of English. The book should be of interest to anyone interested in English linguistics, especially English phonetics and phonology as well as history of English, historical dialectology and pragmatics. The aim of the following paper is to examine fragments of Geoffrey Chaucer’s "The Canterbury Tales", one of the most celebrated specimens of Middle English poetry, with regard to the presence or <b>absence</b> of multiple <b>negation.</b> Negative concord, as the structure in question is often referred to, was firmly ingrained in the language in the Old English period, and, having undergone some formal and syntactic modifications, carried into Middle English. The pattern of its decline in the latter parts of the 15 th century is observed to correlate with the social status of the speaker, the change originating in the higher tiers of the society. Disfavoring negative concord possibly had sources in the administrative and legal language, the subtleties of which Chaucer, having held a number of official posts with the court and chancery, would have most likely been versed in. Consequently, the paper proposes to at least partly account for Chaucer’s choices as regards negative concord from a sociolinguistic perspective and establish a possible connection between the structure’s distributional pattern and the status of "The Canterbury Tales" fictional speakers, who come from very different walks of life. Other factors which may have informed or influenced the author’s morphosyntactic choices will also be mentioned...|$|R
40|$|Specifically, in {{her novel}} Beloved Morrison redefines the slave-narrative {{tradition}} and reveals the discredited history of slavery by unveiling the "interior life" of African American ancestors and rendering memories heretofore unacknowledged and unspoken in classic slave autobiographical narratives. Through a hybrid prose that mixes fiction with {{history in the}} novels The Enigma of Arrival and A Way in the World, Naipaul illuminates "areas of darkness" in the diasporic world of East Indian Trinidadian peoples and provides new ways of transforming the English literary and cultural history. Focusing on West African identity and community, especially the poorest and the most powerless, in the novel The Famished Road Okri brings a mythic and fantastic dimension to postcolonial fiction {{as a way of}} finding images to portray what the public media and the outside world fail to record and comprehend, and gives voice to people who are generally without power and almost without any place in a world of inequality and injustice. Probing into specific representations of incompleteness in the historical novels of Toni Morrison, V. S. Naipaul, and Ben Okri, this thesis underscores the indispensable role of fiction in representing life, rewriting history and enlarging reality. With reference to Paul Ricoeur's conception of the interconnectedness between history and fiction, in particular his analyses in The Reality of the Historical Past, this comparative literary study examines narrative strategies that three contemporary writers of fiction [...] -Toni Morrison, V. S. Naipaul, and Ben Okri [...] -have devised to counteract incompleteness of historical representation. This thesis argues that history as a mode of rendering the past and a way of representing reality is essentially incomplete. In other words, history is incomplete as a systematic written account comprising a chronological record of past events, circumstances, and facts, and as a story or a narrative of events connected with a real or imaginary object or person. Fiction, however, with its underlying capacity to transform and transfigure reality, imagines as well as repatterns unrecognized or misrepresented aspects of individual and cultural histories. In their works of fiction, Morrison, Naipaul, and Okri purposefully address various kinds of historical <b>negation,</b> <b>absence,</b> and incompleteness. Zhu Ying. "May 2005.
