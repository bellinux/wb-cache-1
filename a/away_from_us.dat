5|$|In 1912, Vesto Slipher made spectrographic {{studies of}} the {{brightest}} spiral nebulae to determine their composition. Slipher discovered that the spiral nebulae have high Doppler shifts, indicating that they are moving at a rate exceeding the velocity of the stars he had measured. He found {{that the majority of}} these nebulae are moving <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>us.</b>|$|E
5|$|American {{astronomer}} Edwin Hubble {{observed that}} the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their redshifts. This was interpreted to mean that all distant galaxies and clusters are receding away from our vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance: that is, the farther they are, the faster they move <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>us,</b> regardless of direction. Assuming the Copernican principle (that the Earth is not {{the center of the}} universe), the only remaining interpretation is that all observable regions of the universe are receding from all others. Since we know that the distance between galaxies increases today, it must mean that in the past galaxies were closer together. The continuous expansion of the universe implies that the universe was denser and hotter in the past.|$|E
5|$|For galaxies {{more distant}} than the Local Group {{and the nearby}} Virgo Cluster, but within a {{thousand}} megaparsecs or so, the redshift is approximately proportional to the galaxy's distance. This correlation was first observed by Edwin Hubble and {{has come to be}} known as Hubble's law. Vesto Slipher was the first to discover galactic redshifts, in about the year 1912, while Hubble correlated Slipher's measurements with distances he measured by other means to formulate his Law. In the widely accepted cosmological model based on general relativity, redshift is mainly a result of the expansion of space: this means that the farther away a galaxy is from us, the more the space has expanded in the time since the light left that galaxy, so the more the light has been stretched, the more redshifted the light is, and so the faster it appears to be moving <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>us.</b> Hubble's law follows in part from the Copernican principle. Because it is usually not known how luminous objects are, measuring the redshift is easier than more direct distance measurements, so redshift is sometimes in practice converted to a crude distance measurement using Hubble's law.|$|E

25|$|In {{the solar}} neighborhood, {{the rate of}} {{interstellar}} extinction in the Johnson-Cousins V-band is usually taken to be 0.7-1.0 mag/kpc−simply an average due to the clumpiness of interstellar dust.

25|$|The route {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with I-10 Bus. in Benson near an Amtrak station. The route heads south until it exits the city limit of Benson, where it turns slightly southeast. SR 80 turns eastward, entering St. David as Patton Street. In St. David, SR 80 turns south as Lee Street. SR 80 steers southeast into desert terrain, (south section San Pedro Valley), intersecting SR 82 {{just north of}} Tombstone, where SR 80 becomes Fremont Street. The road intersects SR 90 heading south. In Bisbee, (southern Mule Mountains), the road meets SR 92 at a traffic circle. SR 80 nears the international boundary with Mexico as it nears Douglas. A short concurrency begins where U.S. Route 191 turns eastward heading into Douglas. SR 80 turns north on Pan American Avenue <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>US</b> 191. The route then takes a more northeasterly route away from the international boundary. SR 80 heads through {{a long stretch of}} desert terrain, (San Bernardino Valley), before meeting New Mexico State Road 80 at the New Mexico state line. All of it is surface road, and it is the route of the Butterfield Stage Coach of the nineteenth century, and the Old Spanish Trail.|$|E
25|$|The {{oscillating}} universe theory—that {{the universe}} {{will end in}} a collapse or 'big crunch' followed by another big bang, and so on—dates from 1930. Cosmologists such as professor Alexander Vilenkin from Tufts University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Max Tegmark suggest that if space is sufficiently large and uniform, or infinite as some theories suggest, and if quantum theory is true such {{that there is only}} a finite number of configurations within a finite volume possible, due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, then identical instances of the history of Earth's entire Hubble volume occur every so often, simply by chance. Tegmark calculates that our nearest so-called doppelgänger, is 1010115 meters <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>us</b> (a double exponential function larger than a googolplex). In principle, {{it would be impossible to}} scientifically verify an identical Hubble volume. However, it does follow as a fairly straightforward consequence from otherwise unrelated scientific observations and theories. Tegmark suggests that statistical analyses exploiting the anthropic principle provide an opportunity to test multiverse theories in some cases. Generally, science would consider a multiverse theory that posits neither a common point of causation, nor the possibility of interaction between universes, to be an ideal speculation. However, it is a fundamental assumption of cosmology that the universe continues to exist beyond the scope of the observable universe, and that the distribution of matter is everywhere the same at such a large scale (see cosmological principle).|$|E

500|$|Titanic was {{subjected}} to extreme opposing forces– the flooded bow pulling her down while {{the air in the}} stern kept her to the surface– which were concentrated at one of the weakest points in the structure, the area of the engine room hatch. Shortly after the lights went out, the ship split apart. The submerged bow may have remained attached to the stern by the keel for a short time, pulling the stern to a high angle before separating and leaving the stern to float for a few minutes longer. The forward part of the stern would have flooded very rapidly, causing it to tilt and then settle briefly until sinking. The ship disappeared from view at 02:20, 2 hours and 40 minutes after striking the iceberg. Thayer reported that it rotated on the surface, [...] "gradually [...] her deck <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>us,</b> as though to hide from our sight the awful spectacle...
