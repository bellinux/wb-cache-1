Well, I never cared much for books, you know; but down yonder when the devil tormented me I had to do {{something}} or go stark mad, so I read both the books you gave me. One was beyond me, till that good old man showed me how to read it; but the other, this one, was a comfort, I tell you. It amused me, and was as pretty as poetry.

5000|$|The {{inspiration}} for the novel came {{from one of the}} author’s dreams. “I had a dream that I was in my husband's dream, watching what he was dreaming about.

5000|$|Talking {{about the}} script, Cronenberg {{revealed}} that “It’s {{kind of a}} satire on Hollywood. It’s very typical of Bruce Wagner’s writing. <b>And</b> <b>it’s</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> a condensed essence of Bruce. <b>And</b> while <b>it’s</b> satirical, it’s also very powerful, emotionally, and insightful and funny. You could say it’s a Hollywood film because the characters are agents, actors <b>and</b> managers, but <b>it</b> is not a satire like The Player."

5000|$|In the {{run up to}} {{the release}} of the album, Gigs and Tours interviewed both Paul Heaton and Jacqui Abbott about the album and their working dynamic. Paul {{mentioned}} that, “Jacqui {{is one of the best}} singers I've worked with and is also part of my past. This new album came together easily because we work so well together.

[...] "A guy approached me one night after a concert ... and he showed me how it was impossible for me to drive from L.A. to Phoenix, and then how far it was to Albuquerque. In short, he told me, 'This song is impossible.' And so it is.

5000|$|Having {{recorded}} together previously, Deftones singer Chino Moreno began recording with {{childhood friend}} and neighbor Shaun Lopez, {{also of the}} band Far, as well as Chuck Doom.

Sierra Filucci of Common Sense Media gave this film 2 out of 5 stars and said, [...] "Unfortunately the build-up {{to the main}} part of the story -- the journey to Earth -- takes so long and is packed with so much backstory that kids and even adults might get lost, or just bored. Once the trip begins, things pick up <b>and</b> <b>it's</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> interesting to see humans and Christmas from outsiders' eyes." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "We’ve {{literally}} {{written about}} horror movies, like {{straight from the}} screen kind of thing, {{but this one is}} about horrific human beings and human nature, and the dark side of things, and there’s still a lot of beautiful ways to <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> twist that and write about that. And [...] "Cemetery Girls," [...] is about all of the men just dying, for no apparent reason, and these women are rising up and taking over the world, <b>and</b> <b>it’s</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> the mixture of emotion that comes with things ending. Particularly this apocalyptic setting where there’s a lot of death, but also strength that rises from it." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1991, a film {{adaptation}} of Wayne’s World was greenlit by Paramount Pictures, {{only the second}} movie based upon a Saturday Night Live sketch following The Blues Brothers in 1980.

5000|$|I've come {{to realize}} now I was making like a solo record, {{and if it was}} going to be an Evanescence record, we needed to come {{together}} and make it like a band. That was a hard time for me. I thought I knew what I wanted <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> didn't happen like I wanted it to ... But I have to say I feel so strong about what we're doing now ... We still have some of the same songs from those sessions but we've made them about the band. — Amy Lee, about the album's first sessions ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{thing about}} the {{relationship}} with Fiona is...They are two people who really don't have anybody else they can be with. Anybody {{else is going to}} be afraid of what Michael does, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> turns her on, and anybody else for Michael is going to be uninteresting. He is attracted to her, but part of what we explore over the first season is they really are attracted with each other, and yet there is a reason they broke up. She is an incredibly chaotic person who just thrives on disorder... Violence is foreplay for her. Matt Nix ...|$|E
5000|$|Trump's first post-announcement {{interview}} on June 17, 2015, was with Bill O'Reilly on The O'Reilly Factor. One of several issues he highlighted was his proposed strategy {{in dealing with}} the Syrian Civil War. In the interview, Trump stated: [...] "Iran and Russia are protecting Syria <b>and</b> <b>it's</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> amazing that we're in there fighting ISIS in Syria so we're helping the head of Syria Bashar al-Assad who is not supposed to be our friend although he looks a lot better than some of our so-called friends." [...] Instead of fighting ISIL in Syria, Trump suggested [...] "maybe Syria should be a free zone for ISIS, let them fight and then you pick up the remnants." ...|$|R
5000|$|Of the song's chords, Page remarked: <b>It's</b> in A, <b>and</b> then <b>it</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> goes to an E chord. But then, while it's snaking around it, <b>it</b> {{has some}} <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> little {{triplets}} that {{take you back}} into the A. So, yes, it's tricky. You just have to <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> know how to count it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I've done," [...] said Raffles, {{taking hold}} of his hat which stood before him on the table, <b>and</b> giving <b>it</b> a <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> oratorical push.|$|R
5000|$|The song itself {{deals with}} the growing depictions of {{violence}} in the media at the time and the case of Issei Sagawa, with Jagger saying, [...] "Well there was this scandalous, murderous story in France - it was a true story - about this Japanese guy who murdered this girl <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> captured the imagination of the French public, and the Japanese. The Russians wanted to make a movie out of it. So that was the first bit and then I started becoming more light-hearted about it, movies and all. ...it came out as a sort of anti-gratuitous cinema of violence. And it's a kind of anti-violent thing." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Being {{involved}} in it, I always {{felt it was}} going to be a better song. Whereas, what it is is, it's a great feeling. I love the whole introduction: it's total experiment. <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> seems to lead you into a place that for me, personally, I was never quite sure it achieved where {{it was going to}} go to. I know for some people they absolutely love that, because it's not a [...] "song" [...] song, per se. But for other reasons there are so many sonic things on that track that if I detailed what was doing what, you wouldn't believe what was going on."

5000|$|Stone {{worked for}} Atlantic as a producer, songwriter, and arranger. During {{a trip to}} the South in 1949 with Ahmet Ertegün and Herb Abramson, Stone {{discovered}} that Atlantic's records were not selling in the southern states because they lacked a certain danceable quality. Stone later said: [...] "I listened to the stuff that was being done by those thrown-together bands in the joints down there, and I concluded that the only thing that was missing from the stuff we were recording was the rhythm. All we needed was a bass line. So I designed a bass pattern, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> became identified with rock'n'roll - doo, da-DOO, DUM; doo, da-DOO, DUM - that thing. I'm the guilty person that started that." ...|$|E
5000|$|Katie Findlay (Rosie Larsen) {{spoke about}} playing a {{deceased}} character and about only {{appearing in the}} series during flashbacks: [...] "Is there anything not strange about playing a deceased character? I've never done it before. It's interesting when you only have so much time that's in your hands to tell your part of the story. Having to pop {{in and out of}} the plot and work with the space that I had was really fun and challenging... I kind of enjoyed the space that I had to work with and I trusted that in the end that they would bring it back around. I don't think it would work if you saw more of her — you're getting what everyone else remembers, <b>and</b> <b>it's</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> all the more haunting for that." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{generally}} praised by critics, with Pitchfork Media writer Mark Richardson saying [...] "Harmony in Ultraviolet is sensual body music {{of a very}} particular kind, <b>and</b> <b>it's</b> the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> record that asks a lot. But if you trust <b>it</b> <b>and</b> go along, <b>it</b> knows exactly where to lay its hands." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{interesting}} thing about the guitar solo {{is that it was}} recorded after we had already finished [...] "Heartbreaker" [...] - it was an afterthought. That whole section was recorded in a different studio <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> slotted in the middle. If you notice, the whole sound of the guitar is different.|$|R
