40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} dental bleaching on the shear bond strength of enamel. Methods: Fifty molars were selected and divided into five groups (n= 10); G 1 -without bleaching (control); G 2 -bleached with 10 % carbamide peroxide <b>and</b> <b>restored</b> 24 h later; G 3 -bleached with 10 % carbamide peroxide <b>and</b> <b>restored</b> seven days later; G 4 -bleached with 35 % hydrogen peroxide <b>and</b> <b>restored</b> a 35 % <b>and</b> <b>restored</b> 24 h later; G 5 -bleached with 35 % hydrogen peroxide <b>and</b> <b>restored</b> a 35 % <b>and</b> <b>restored</b> seven days later. During the 24 h and 7 -day intervals the test specimens remained stored in artificial saliva, after which the restorative procedures were performed on the enamel. Results: The microshear bond strength test indicated the following results in MPa (ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc) : G 1 - 43. 15 a (± 5. 19); G 2 - 31. 34 ab (± 4. 41); G 3 - 36. 66 ab (± 3. 11); G 4 - 22. 87 c (± 3. 76) and G 5 - 35. 67 ab (± 4. 64). Conclusion: Groups G 1, G 2, G 3 and G 5 showed no statistical difference and Group G 4 (bleached with 35 % hydrogen peroxide <b>and</b> <b>restored</b> 24 h later) showed diminished bond strength between the bleached enamel and resin composite...|$|R

5|$|A pagan {{backlash}} against Christianity followed Æthelberht's death in 616, forcing Justus and Mellitus {{to flee to}} Gaul. The pair probably took refuge with Chlothar, hoping that the Frankish king would intervene <b>and</b> <b>restore</b> them to their sees, and by 617 Justus had been reinstalled in his bishopric by the new king. Mellitus also returned to England, but the prevailing pagan mood did not allow {{him to return to}} London; after Laurence's death, Mellitus became Archbishop of Canterbury. According to Bede, Justus received letters of encouragement from Pope Boniface V (619–625), as did Mellitus, although Bede does not record the actual letters. The historian J. M.
