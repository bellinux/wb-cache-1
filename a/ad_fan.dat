40|$|This {{is content}} {{analysis}} of political advertising during Nigeria’s 2015 general election {{with a view to}} ascertaining the following: The extent to which the <b>ads</b> <b>fanned</b> religious sentiments, the scale with which the ads resorted to personal attacks, the level to which the ads employed ethnic/tribal/regional/tendencies, {{the degree to which the}} ads adopted hate messages, the magnitude to which the ads embraced issue-based approaches to the campaign and finally, the scope to which the ad copies complied to the APCON code on political advertising. The ad copy constituted the unit of analysis while the period of study covered January to March, 2015. Two newspapers namely: The Guardian and The Punch were studied giving off a total of 240 issues. A census sampling procedure was undertaken while the major parameter for coding was the frequency of occurrence of the identified categorisation scheme. The results of the study showed that 63 % of the ads dealt with non-issues. Regarding issue-based ads, socio-cultural issues constituted the majority. Of the non-issues analysed in the study, neutral (celebratory) messages were as high as 44. 42 % while personal attack ads amounted to 41. 04 %. However, religious, ethnic and sectional sentiments and violent/hate messages occurred at 6. 23 %, 3. 89 % and 1. 82 % respectively. The conclusion of the study is that political advertising in the two Nigerian newspapers was largely non-issue based and still some marks off compliance with APCON code on political advertising. These findings have serious implications for journalism and political advertising practice in Nigeria necessitating the recommendations made herein. 1...|$|R

40|$|Lake Poerua is a small, shallow {{lake that}} abuts the scarp of the Alpine Fault on the West Coast of New Zealand’s South Island. Radiocarbon dates from drowned podocarp {{trees on the}} lake floor, a {{sediment}} core from a rangefront alluvial fan, and living tree ring ages {{have been used to}} deduce the late Holocene history of the lake. Remnant drowned stumps of kahikatea (Dacrycarpus dacrydioides) at 1. 7 – 1. 9 m water depth yield a preferred time-ofdeath age at 1766 – 1807 AD, while a dryland podocarp and kahikatea stumps at 2. 4 – 2. 6 m yield preferred time-of-death ages of ca. 1459 – 1626 AD. These age ranges are matched to, but offset from, the timings of Alpine Fault rupture events at ca. 1717 AD, and either ca. 1615 or 1430 <b>AD.</b> Alluvial <b>fan</b> detritus dated from a core into the toe of a rangefront alluvial fan, at an equivalent depth to the maximum depth of the modern lake (6. 7 m), yields a calibrated age of AD 1223 – 1413. This age is similar to the timing of an earlier Alpine Fault rupture event at ca. 1230 AD± 50 yr. Kahikatea trees growing on rangefront fans give ages of up to 270 yr, which is consistent with alluvial fan aggradation following the 1717 AD earthquake. The elevation levels of the lake and fan imply a causal and chronological link between lake-level rise and Alpine Fault rupture. The {{results of this study suggest}} that the growth of large, coalescing alluvial fans (Dry and Evans Creek fans) originating from landslides within the rangefront of the Alpine Fault and the rise in the level of Lake Poerua may occur within a decade or so of large Alpine Fault earthquakes that rupture adjacent to this area. These rises have in turn drowned lowland forests that fringed the lake. Radiocarbon chronologies built using OxCal show that a series of massive landscape changes beginning with fault rupture, followed by landsliding, fan sedimentation and lake expansion. However, drowned Kahikatea trees may be poor candidates for intimately dating these events, as they may be able to tolerate water for several decades after metre-scale lake level rises have occurred...|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{management}} of an outdoor electronic enclosure {{can be quite}} challenging due to the additional thermal load {{from the sun and}} the requirement of having an air-sealed enclosure. It is essential to consider the effect of solar heating loads in the design process; otherwise, it can shorten the life expectancy of the electronic product or lead to catastrophic failure. In this paper we analyze and compare the effectiveness of different cooling techniques used for outdoor electronics. Various cooling techniques were compared like special coatings and paints on the outer surface, radiation shields, double-walled vented enclosures, fans for internal air circulation and air-to-air heat exchangers. A highly simplified, typical outdoor system was selected for this study measuring approximately 300 x 300 x 400 mm (WxLxH). Solar radiation was incident on 3 sides of the enclosure. There were 8 equally spaced PCBs inside the enclosure dissipating 12. 5 W each uniformly (100 watts total). A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the system was built and analyzed. This was followed by building a mock-up of the system and conducting experiments to validate the CFD model. It was found that some of the simplest cooling techniques like white oil paint on the outer surface can significantly reduce the impact of solar loads. <b>Adding</b> internal circulation <b>fans</b> can also be very effective. Using air-to-air heat exchangers was found to be the most effective solution although it is more complex and costly. Comment: Submitted on behalf of TIMA Editions ([URL]...|$|R

In Belgrade and Novi Sad, McDonald's shops were damaged by protestors.According to Serbian sources, the violent protestors were <b>ad</b> hoc football <b>fans.</b> 54 policemen and 34 citizens were injured. A Dutch journalist suffered broken ribs. Serbian politicians condemned the violence.The total damage from the violence was estimated at over 8 million Serbian dinars ($US 143,000). The United Nations Security Council responded to these incidents by issuing a unanimous statement that, [...] "The members of the Security Council condemn in the strongest terms the mob attacks against embassies in Belgrade, which have resulted in damage to embassy premises and have endangered diplomatic personnel," [...] noting that the 1961 Vienna Convention requires host states to protect embassies.In response to the attacks, the German embassy announced that it would temporarily stop granting visas to Serbian citizens. Also on February 21, Serbian army reservists from Kuršumlija took their protest into Kosovo, during which time they attacked the Kosovo Police Service with stones. An explosive was set off in the Kosovo Serb enclave of Kosovska Mitrovica near a United Nations-run courthouse. During the rally there were people who carried portraits of ICTY-fugitive former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadžić and the blue-red flag of the far-right Orthodox organization Obraz. In Kraljevo, Obraz was responsible for the vandalization of an Evangelical church. In Valjevo, a Slovenian firm Sava Osiguranje was set on fire, most likely by protesting youths.

5000|$|Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku {{gives the}} movie more {{positive}} review {{than the first}} film, commenting [...] "while the first movie suffered somewhat from its limited scope as the story's beginning, Midsummer Knight's Dream is where the tale really hits its stride". He praised the movie impressively takes a fourth of the overall story and makes it largely standalone by focusing on a thematic arc and character development. <b>Adding</b> that a <b>fan</b> of the game or just someone continuing on from the last film will no doubt enjoy the sequel. Most of the praised goes to the vast development of Makoto and the new characters introduced; Koromaru, Ken, and Aigis. He remarked that [...] "Makoto's personal struggle with his insecurities is the movie’s central theme {{and the consequences of}} how his doubts affect his performance have lasting consequences for him beyond this single film". He also enjoyed Makoto's relationship with Aigis, making it easier to relate to the epilogue, The Answer from Persona 3 FES, where it is Aigis, not Makoto who is the main player character. And while he thinks that the fan service was a bit too much, [...] "the fanservice is also the basis for some genuinely funny comedy—especially as the male trio of characters go around the beach hitting on every girl they come across." [...] However, Eisenbeis expressed his disappointment {{of the way of the}} mysteries from the first movie [...] "are explained through long conversations of direct exposition." [...] And while no doubt the movie makes for a good introduction to the new characters, it also made some of the main cast members that debuted in the first film, particularly Junpei, Mitsuru, and Fuka, reduced to supporting roles without any further character development, comparing them to [...] "might as well be lampposts for all they add to the plot".|$|R
30|$|A {{specific}} component for heat transfer mechanism in automobile engine block is the radiator. It {{is a form}} of heat exchanger used for cooling the internal combustion engines, mainly in automobiles and in piston engine of aircrafts, locomotives (trains), motorcycles and stationary generating plants. It circulates liquid through the engine block where it is heated, then pumped through the radiator where it loses heat to the atmosphere via fins and lastly returns to the engine block. In this regard, {{there is a need to}} improve the technical parts of a car engine to attain high efficiency, to achieve optimal fuel consumption, to increase working life and to reduce pollution. Reducing the weight of a car with optimal design of its radiator is a necessity. <b>Adding</b> fins and <b>fan</b> is one way to increase the rate of cooling in automobile radiators in which a larger surface area for heat transfer is created and air convection is utilised to enhance heat transfer. However, with the advent of nanofluids, the rate of heat transfer in radiators can be improved by the employment of a coolant fluid with enhanced thermal conductivity. The most commonly used coolant fluids are water or ethylene glycol whose thermal conductivity coefficient is very low. However, as earlier pointed out, their heat transfer performance is often limited by their low thermal conductivities which obstruct the performance enhancement and compactness of heat exchangers. Wang and Mujumdar [11] investigated heat transfer characteristics of nanofluids and recommended further research on the main parameters affecting their heat transfer properties. Das et al. [12] investigated utilisation of nanofluids in heat exchangers and realised a significant possibility for use in cooling and related technologies. Thermal conductivity of metallic liquids is much greater than that of non-metallic liquids. It is then expected that the thermal conductivities of the fluids with metallic nanoparticles should be significantly higher. Nguyen et al. [13] used Al 2 O 3 /water nanofluids in cooling system of electrical devices and they observed a lot of improvement of heat transfer coefficients for a low level volume fraction of nanoparticles. Leong et al. [14] investigated the performance of ethylene glycol/copper nanofluids and reported an enhanced heat transfer rate. Research undertaken by [15 – 19] has shown that dispersing nanoparticles of copper (Cu), copper oxide (CuO), aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3), titanium oxide (TiO 2) lead to an anomalously increased thermal physical properties of ethylene glycol-based nanofluids.|$|R
