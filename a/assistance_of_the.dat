5|$|The {{increasing}} {{taxes and}} the new burdens stirred up the commoners. The Transylvanian Saxons could only overcome their rebellious serfs with the <b>assistance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vice-voivode, Roland Lépes, in 1417. The united armies of the counties and the Saxon seats crushed the Székely commoners' uprising in 1433. In early 1434, the burghers of Kronstadt had to seek the <b>assistance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> count of the Székelys against the Vlachs who had risen up in Fogaras County. Hussite ideas, especially their egalitarian Taborite version, began to spread among the peasantry in the 1430s. In May 1436, George Lépes urged the inquisitor James of the Marches to come to Transylvania, because Hussite preachers had converted many people to their faith in his diocese.|$|E

Zamoyski, who strongly opposed Sigismund Báthory's anti-Ottoman policy, supported Andrew and Stephen.|$|E
