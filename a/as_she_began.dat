She feuded with Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff. On the October 31 episode of SmackDown! at a Halloween party, Stephanie McMahon and Eric Bischoff shared a kiss while McMahon was dressed as a witch and Bischoff was disguised as her father underneath a mask.

5|$|She {{was known}} for her honesty and {{moderate}} life style. Having received a small scholarship in 1893, she returned it in 1897 as soon <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>began</b> earning her keep. She gave much of her first Nobel Prize money to friends, family, students, and research associates. In an unusual decision, Curie intentionally refrained from patenting the radium-isolation process, so that the scientific community could do research unhindered. She insisted that monetary gifts and awards {{be given to the}} scientific institutions she was affiliated with rather than to her. She and her husband often refused awards and medals. Albert Einstein reportedly remarked that she was probably the only person who could not be corrupted by fame.|$|E
5|$|The Frank sisters each {{hoped to}} return to school {{as soon as they were}} able, and {{continued}} with their studies while in hiding. Margot took a shorthand course by correspondence in Bep Voskuijl's name and received high marks. Most of Anne's time was spent reading and studying, and she regularly wrote and edited her diary entries. In addition to providing a narrative of events as they occurred, she wrote about her feelings, beliefs, and ambitions, subjects she felt she could not discuss with anyone. As her confidence in her writing grew, and <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>began</b> to mature, she wrote of more abstract subjects such as her belief in God, and how she defined human nature.|$|E

After about 15 hours a thick fog set in. Florence began to doubt her ability, and she told her mother, who {{was in one of}} the boats, that she did not think she could make it. She swam for another hour before asking to be pulled out, unable to see the coastline due to the fog. As she sat in the boat, she found out she had stopped swimming just one mile away from her destination. Two months later, she tried again. The same thick fog set in, but she succeeded in reaching Catalina. She said that she kept a mental image of the shoreline in her mind while she swam. She later swam the Catalina channel on two additional occasions.|$|E
500|$|Lavigne {{eventually}} {{took on a}} more gothic style <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>began</b> {{her second}} album, Under My Skin, trading her skating outfits for black tutus and developing an image marked by angst. During The Best Damn Thing years, Lavigne changed directions. She dyed her hair blonde with a pink streak, wore feminine outfits, including [...] "tight jeans and heels", and modelled for magazines such as Harper's Bazaar. Lavigne defended her new style: [...] "I don't really regret anything. You know, the ties and the wife-beaters and all... It had its time and place. And now I'm all grown up, and I've moved on".|$|E

500|$|For a decade, Johnson's {{constant}} {{work on the}} Dictionary disrupted his and Tetty's living conditions. He had {{to employ}} a number of assistants for the copying and mechanical work, which filled the house with incessant noise and clutter. He was always busy, and kept hundreds of books around. John Hawkins described the scene: [...] "The books he {{used for this purpose}} were what he had in his own collection, a copious but a miserably ragged one, and all such as he could borrow; which latter, if ever they came back to those that lent them, were so defaced as to be scarce worth owning." [...] Johnson was also distracted by Tetty's poor health <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>began</b> to show signs of a terminal illness. To accommodate both his wife and his work, he moved to 17 Gough Square near his printer, William Strahan.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{commercial}} success of PCD (2005), {{and over the}} course of two years (2005–07), Scherzinger recorded 75-100 songs for Her Name Is Nicole, her planned solo debut album. [...] Her work as lead singer furthered Scherzinger's popularity <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>began</b> work on her own music. She stated that she enjoyed collaborating with many different artists, and that although she had been writing songs for over ten years, {{she felt as if she}} was at a different level while working with such A-list writers and producers. Following the moderate success of [...] "Baby Love", the complete lack of success of the singles such as [...] "Whatever U Like" [...] and numerous push backs, Scherzinger decided to put the release of the on hold. She then returned her focus back on the Pussycat Dolls, and recording commenced for their second studio album. Scherzinger cited that she felt as if the songs were more suited as a Pussycat Dolls song than her own.|$|E

500|$|In 1991 Jackson {{signed the}} first of two record-breaking multimillion-dollar {{contracts}} with Virgin Records, establishing her as one of the highest-paid artists in the industry. Her subsequent fifth [...] album Janet (1993) saw her develop a public image as a sex symbol <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>began</b> to explore sexuality in her music. That same year, she appeared in her first starring film role in Poetic Justice; she has since continued to act in feature films. By the end of the 1990s, she was named by Billboard magazine as the second most successful recording artist of the decade after Mariah Carey.

500|$|The show {{began with}} Carey {{standing}} on a small elevated centerpiece on stage, surrounded by several long draped curtains. Carey featured three background vocalists throughout the tour, Trey Lorenz, Melodie Daniels and Kelly Price. As the introduction began with [...] "Emotions", each of the curtains were slowly draped, revealing Carey atop the platform, dressed in a beige mini-dress and matching sheer blouse and stiletto heels. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>began</b> performing [...] "Emotions", the platform was lowered so Carey could access the other sections of the stage throughout the song's performance. [...] After an intimate performance with dimmed lights for [...] "The Roof (Back in Time)", Carey was joined on-stage by a Peruvian guitar player, who played the Latin-inspired guitar melodies during her performance of [...] "My All".

60|$|In {{this one}} passion man can {{strength}} enjoy, As fits give vigour, {{just when they}} destroy. Time, that on all things lays his lenient hand, Yet tames not this; it sticks to our last sand. Consistent in our follies and our sins, Here honest Nature ends <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>begins.</b>|$|R
