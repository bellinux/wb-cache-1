25|$|For generations, {{there have}} been legends recounted by the {{inhabitants}} of the areas surrounding Mount Kanchenjunga, both in Sikkim and in Nepal, that there is a valley of immortality hidden on its slopes. These stories are well known to both the original inhabitants of the area, the Lepcha people, and those of the Tibetan Buddhist cultural tradition. In Tibetan, this valley is known as Beyul Demoshong. In 1962 a Tibetan Lama by the name of Tulshuk Lingpa led over 300 followers into the high snow slopes of Kanchenjunga to ‘open the way’ to Beyul Demoshong. The story of this expedition is recounted in the 2011 book <b>A</b> <b>Step</b> <b>Away</b> <b>from</b> Paradise.|$|E
25|$|Nagako was betrothed to her {{distant cousin}} Prince Hirohito (1901–1989) {{at a very}} young age, in a match {{arranged}} by their parents, which was usual in Japanese society at that time. Her lineage and her father's unblemished military career were the major considerations. In January 1919, the engagement of Princess Nagako to the then-Crown Prince Hirohito (later Emperor Shōwa), was announced. In <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> tradition, Hirohito was allowed to choose his own bride. Nagako herself had no choice in the matter. At the age of 14, she and other eligible women participated in a tea ceremony at the Imperial Palace while the Crown Prince watched unseen from behind a screen. He eventually selected Nagako.|$|E

25|$|A sportier {{version of}} the 200B sedan was {{released}} in June 1978. The new SX featured a revised grille, front spoiler, alloy wheels, revised door and seat trim (striped seat inserts) and tachometer, while the suspension was altered to improve handling. The colours available for this model were simply blue, white or red, and the only transmission available was a 4-speed floor shift. Significantly the SX was a unique model to Australia, the added input from Nissan's Australian design engineers signified <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> just assembling cars. This in turn led to the locally built Datsuns, and later Nissans, being re-engineered to better suit Australian conditions, with many components being sourced locally a tradition that would continue right up until 1992, when Nissan ceased local manufacture.|$|E

500|$|The tenth {{season has}} been cited by some critics and fans as the {{beginning}} of the series' decline in quality. By 2000, some long-term fans had become disillusioned with the show and pointed to its shift from character-driven plots to what they perceived as an overemphasis on zany antics and gags. Chris Turner wrote in his book Planet Simpson that [...] "one of the things that emerged was that [...] began to rely on gags, not characters, wherever that switch got flipped, whether it's the ninth or tenth season." [...] Jesse Hassenger of PopMatters named the tenth season of The Simpsons the series' [...] "first significant dip in quality, <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> its golden era [...] with broader gags and more outlandish plots," [...] and a BBC News writer commented that [...] "the common consensus is that The Simpsons golden era ended after season nine".

Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart Simpson, called it {{one of her favorite}} The Simpsons episodes, along with [...] "Bart Sells His Soul" [...] and [...] "Lisa's Substitute". The Toronto Suns Bruce Kirkland wrote that [...] "Bart the Mother" [...] was one of the [...] "classic episodes" [...] of the series' tenth season. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood wrote, [...] "We particularly like the moral dilemma at the end, as underlined by Lisa, regarding the eventual culling of the lizards that will need to take place.

[...] Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide said, [...] "The show generates decent heart as it shows Bart’s attempts to make up for his misbehavior.

[...] Jesse Hassenger of PopMatters named the tenth season of The Simpsons the series' [...] "first significant dip in quality, <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> its golden era [...] with broader gags and more outlandish plots". However, Hassenger enjoyed [...] "Bart the Mother", and wrote, [...] " [...] explores the show’s sweet and dark sides simultaneously as Bart, remorseful after killing a bird, tries to care for orphaned eggs that turn out to hold ravenous lizards." [...] DVD Town's James Plath described [...] "Bart the Mother" [...] as an episode that viewers would either love or hate, because of Bart's rare moments of soul searching, and he found the episode to be a memorable one.|$|E

2500|$|Rihanna's fifth studio album Loud {{and single}} [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] drew several {{comparisons}} to All for You, with critics noting its sonic transition to an upbeat dance sound from prior release Rated R {{in a similar}} vein to Jackson's contrast from the darker tone of The Velvet Rope. Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine stated, [...] "like Janet's album, Loud is <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> its über-personal, melodrama-drenched predecessor." [...] Throughout the campaign, Rihanna also evoked Jackson's Velvet Rope era imagery. Ne-Yo's [...] "Say It" [...] was thought to resemble the album's sensual ballads. Record producer Rockwilder revealed Jackson to be his first pop collaboration and an essential part of his career, leading him to work with Christina Aguilera for the singles [...] "Lady Marmalade" [...] and [...] "Dirrty." [...] Rolling Stone likened the production of Aaliyah's self-titled third album to the record. Sal Cinquemani of Slant observed several songs on Usher's 8701 to recall [...] "bona fide Janet Jackson tracks" [...] similar to the album. Christina Milian's debut album was considered to be heavily influenced by the album. The sensual content and interludes of Missy Elliott's This Is Not a Test! also drew comparisons to the album's exploration of similar themes. Following All for You being reissued with a Parental Advisory warning and clean edition, Jennifer Lopez's sophomore album J.Lo received a similar treatment by Epic Records, thought to be influenced by Jackson's decision after media emphasis was placed on its explicit language and content.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} Constant Chaos was released, Jones had {{temporarily}} halted activity on his labels {{for almost a}} year. Still DJing as Cajmere he'd narrowed the Green Velvet persona down to live performances only, taking time out to re-group and work {{out what to do}} next. During 2000, Jones was briefly signed to Warner Bros. Records' short-lived F-111 imprint, where he released his second compilation album, the self-titled Green Velvet, which contained the double-A-sided single “Flash” backed with “Answering Machine.” During this time he gave Velvet a new hairstyle—from spiked, green foam nodules to yellow mohawk. Next, in 2001, he unleashed his second album, the dark Whatever, which was <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> his Kraftwerk-inspired sound (although Sleepwalking had a similar style) to a darker, more political Punk-esque style. On the album he tackled such issues as racism (highlighted on the song When?), drug use (highlighted on Genedefekt and La La Land), alienation (highlighted on Sleepwalking), and being told what to wear and do by the system (highlighted on the heavily punk-inspired track Gat). The more punk-oriented songs on the album apparently came from hours spent listening to industrial bands such as Nitzer Ebb and Liaisons Dangereuses, and lots of [...] "underground American industrial stuff." [...] He released the single La La Land in 2001, originally designed as a wake-up call for clubbers to the dangers of pill-taking it became one of his most popular tunes. This was followed by Genedefekt. His live act had now became more like a rock band also, with the Curtis playing a keytar, and two other musicians (aptly named Nazuk and Spaceboy) backing him, playing heavily distorted synths. Initially Jones, as both Cajmere and Green Velvet, was receiving more attention in Europe than he did in the USA, playing a Radio One live session on the Jo Whiley show and playing a host of festivals.|$|E
