5|$|Although {{he made no}} pretence {{regarding}} {{the significance of the}} Senate under his absolute rule, those senators he deemed unworthy were expelled from the Senate, and in the distribution of public offices he rarely favoured family members; a policy that stood in contrast to the nepotism practiced by Vespasian and Titus. Above all, however, Domitian valued loyalty and malleability in those he assigned to strategic posts, qualities he found more often in men of the equestrian order than in members of the Senate or his own family, whom he regarded with suspicion, <b>and</b> <b>promptly</b> removed from office if they disagreed with imperial policy.|$|E

5|$|De Vita Caesarum is {{also the}} source of several {{outrageous}} stories regarding Domitian's marriage life. According to Suetonius, Domitia Longina was exiled in 83 because of {{an affair with a}} famous actor named Paris. When Domitian found out, he allegedly murdered Paris in the street <b>and</b> <b>promptly</b> divorced his wife, with Suetonius further adding that once Domitia was exiled, Domitian took Julia as his mistress, who later died during a failed abortion.|$|E

When {{news of the}} revolts reached Alexander, he responded quickly. Though advised to use diplomacy, Alexander mustered 3,000 Macedonian cavalry and rode south towards Thessaly. He found the Thessalian army occupying the pass between Mount Olympus and Mount Ossa, and ordered his men to ride over Mount Ossa. When the Thessalians awoke the next day, they found Alexander in their rear <b>and</b> <b>promptly</b> surrendered, adding their cavalry to Alexander's force. He then continued south towards the Peloponnese.|$|E
5|$|On 4 March 1943, {{during the}} Battle of the Bismarck Sea, General George Kenney ordered Allied patrol boats and {{aircraft}} to attack Japanese rescue vessels, {{as well as}} the survivors from the sunken vessels on life rafts and swimming or floating in the sea. This was later justified on the grounds that rescued servicemen would have been rapidly landed at their military destination <b>and</b> <b>promptly</b> returned to active service. These orders violated the Hague Convention of 1907, which banned the killing of shipwreck survivors under any circumstances.|$|E

Against Glamorgan, Miller took two wickets before {{striking}} a hard-hitting 84 with five sixes. He struck {{one of the}} sixes with one hand, sending it 20 rows into the crowd. In a match against Lancashire, Jack Ikin had reached 99 despite being repeatedly hit. Miller refused to bowl to Ikin, saying that he felt the batsman deserved a century. Lindwall was given the ball <b>and</b> <b>promptly</b> removed Ikin for 99.|$|E

The team {{joined at the}} start of the 1897–98 season <b>and</b> <b>promptly</b> won the league. The club then applied for election to the Football League. Although they were initially rejected, the league later decided to expand Division Two by four clubs and New Brighton Tower were accepted. They carried on playing until 1901 when the company disbanded the team as they did not gain the fan base they were hoping for and so it was no longer considered financially viable.|$|E

5|$|Under Hall's command, the Polaris {{departed}} from New York City in June 1871.

Batista's win and Daniel Bryan's lack {{of participation in the}} Royal Rumble match was heavily booed by the live crowd at the event. At Elimination Chamber, Randy Orton successfully defended his championship in the Elimination Chamber match to set up Orton versus Batista (who still received a negative fan reaction at Elimination Chamber when he defeated Alberto Del Rio) for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania XXX.

The series ends with a metal-eating virus loose on Red Dwarf. The entire resurrected crew evacuates save the original dwarfers. In the cliffhanger ending, Rimmer is left stranded alone to face Death (<b>and</b> <b>promptly</b> knees him in the groin and flees).|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} April 1920, the Yankees were 4–7, {{with the}} Red Sox leading the league with a 10–2 mark. Ruth had done little, having injured himself {{swinging}} the bat. Both situations began to change on May 1, when Ruth hit a tape measure home that sent the ball {{completely out of the}} Polo Grounds, a feat believed to have been previously accomplished only by Shoeless Joe Jackson. The Yankees won, 6–0, taking three out of four from the Red Sox. Ruth hit his second home run on May 2, {{and by the end of}} the month had set a major league record for home runs in a month with 11, <b>and</b> <b>promptly</b> broke it with 13 in June. Fans responded with record attendance figures. On May 16, Ruth and the Yankees drew 38,600 to the Polo Grounds, a record for the ballpark, and 15,000 fans were turned away.
