5000|$|In 2009, Gaunt’s group {{reported}} a copper catalyzed meta-selective C-H arylation reaction on <b>anilide</b> derivatives. Despite the intrinsic ortho-/para- selectivity of the amido group, the arylation occurs {{exclusively on the}} meta position {{on a variety of}} <b>anilide</b> substrates. Remarkably, the regioselectivity is totally different from the earlier reported Pd catalyzed C-H functionalizations, where the amido group serve as a powerful ortho-directing group. The method is robust under mild reaction conditions. It is compatible with a spectrum of substituted <b>anilide</b> as well as different bisaryliodonium salts. However, the meta-selectivity is lost when highly ortho/para-directing methoxy group substitutes one of the meta-hydrogen of the <b>anilide,</b> which marks the limitation of this method.

40|$|AbstractThe {{underlying}} {{etiology of}} the toxic oil syndrome {{may be related}} to any of several toxic contaminants. The hypothesis is made that two or more toxic compounds may act synergistically to cause vascular damage in the toxic oil syndrome. To support this hypothesis, previous studies are reviewed concerning the remarkable synergistic toxic action of allylamine and beta-aminopropionitrile on the media of blood vessels. Although these toxins are not directly related to the toxic oil syndrome, this previous experimental work emphasizes the possibility that unexplored synergistic actions may be important. Furthermore, the hypothesis that contaminating fatty acid <b>anilides</b> in toxic oil undergo alterations during cooking is supported by high pressure liquid chromatographic analysis. The theoretic metabolism of fatty acid <b>anilides</b> is discussed. Recent data concerning the toxic actions of the <b>anilides</b> of oleic and linoleic acid are given. These data suggest that these <b>anilides</b> induce immunologic alterations that may be similar to those seen in the toxic oil syndrome. In addition, the heated <b>anilides</b> appear to have increased toxicity, supporting the concept that the use of toxic oil in cooking may increase its toxicity...|$|R

50|$|In the {{reaction}} of aniline with a β-ketoester, there are two possible sites of attack for the aniline nitrogen atom: the very reactive keto group, or the less reactive ester group. When Conrad and Limpach first observed this reaction in 1887, it was run at room temperature, and gave high yields of β-aminoacrylate: the kinetic product. The reaction then continued to give the final product of 4-hydroxyquinoline. However, Ludwig Knorr observed that under higher temperatures (approximately 140 °C) the aniline would actually attack the ester group of the β-ketoester, leading to the thermodynamically preferred β-keto acid <b>anilide</b> product (albeit in less than ideal yields). Continuation of this reaction using the Conrad-Limpach mechanism led to the synthesis of 2-hydroxyquinoline. The initial synthesis of 2-hydroxyquinoline from a β-ketoanilide was reported in 1886 as the Knorr quinoline synthesis. Therefore, the overall reaction is sometimes called the “Conrad-Limpach-Knorr reaction”.|$|E

40|$|The {{catalytic}} ortho-arylation of phenols is {{a reaction}} {{that has been}} developed by our Bedford and coworkers allowing the construction of 2 -hydroxybiphenyls from aryl halides and phenols. The biaryl sub-unit {{is important in the}} formation of pharmaceutically relevant products, polymers, liquid crystals, and as ligands for homogeneous transition metal catalysts. The scope of this catalytic process has been investigated by extending the technique to tackle a more biologically and pharmaceutically relevant phenol: (L) -tvrosine. The catalysis has proven successful with range of aryl bromides including electron deficient, electron neutral, and sterically hindered species. Cleavage of the tert-butyl protecting group has given rise to successful diarylation. An elegant approach to the ortho-arylation of phenols would avoid the use of a protecting group in the 2 - position. We have therefore investigated the use of carbamates as masked phenols. Our results have also shown an unprecedented level of selectivity for mono-arylated product. These results will also be presented In an aim to move away from industrially disfavoured solvents, such as chlorinated DCE, and strong acid solvents, which have poor tolerance of functional groups, solvent-free C-H activation was developed.
