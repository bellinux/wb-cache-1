40|$|The Soil Survey Investigations Branch of the Soil Conservation Service has {{conducted}} a coordinated {{study of the}} landscape and soils in a desert area of southern New Mexico since 1957. The purposes {{of the study were}} to delineate the kinds of land forms and soils in the area and to determine their origin in terms of the physiographic history of the region. This study has been termed the Desert Project. Within the framework for this project, a soil profile was selected for a detailed study of mineral weathering. This soil (Terino) formed on the Dona Ana geomorphic surface which is the oldest surface delineated in the Desert Project. In Ice Canyon, the location of the Terino profile, the Dona Ana geomorphic surface is composed of alluvial fan sediments derived from Soledad Rhyolite. The Terino profile formed in these sediments is classified <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Typic</b> Petrocalcic Paleargid according to the U. S. D. A. soil classification system (7 th Approximation). The Terino profile was selected for study because it exhibits certain morphological characteristics that appear to be unique to a desert environment. The Terino profile is through to have formed in place from alluvial fan sediments derived from Soledad Rhyolite. The profile contains a well-developed argillic horizon suggestive of greater clay formation and illuviation than would be expected in an arid climate. There is no carbonate evident in the surface 23 inches of the profile. Below a depth of 23 inches, however, abundant carbonate is present. A laminar zone is evident at 25 inches and below within the zone of carbonate accumulation. Voids in the mineral material composing the laminar zone are plugged with material high in calcium carbonate. The purpose of this investigation is to compare the mineralogy of the Soledad Rhyolite rock with mineral constituents in the soil profile to evaluate mineral weathering and soil development during the genesis of the Terino profile.

The simulated objects are programs carried on messages that physically migrate through the underlying space and carry along their entire behavior. We describe the implementation of several basic behaviors of such autonomous mobile objects e. g., following a given line segment, moving in a certain direction, or searching for information in the object's vicinity.

40|$|Results from on-farm {{measurements}} of surface overland flow of both runon (Ron) and runoff (Roff) are presented for a continuously cutivated pearl millet (#Pennisetum glaucum$ (L.) R. Br.) field, along a characteristic catena, in the Sahel (Niger). Despite the deep sandy soil along the studied hillslope, classified <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Typic</b> Haplustult, non-negligible depths of Roff was measured during two rainy seasons : 12 - 13 % of total rainfall for the upslope position and 6 - 8 % for the downslope position. This was {{explained by the}} presence of surface crusts with low infiltrability. Upslope, more than 30 % of the soil surface was covered with erosion crusts (runoff coefficient (Kr) = 60 - 70 % for moist soil conditions) during 40 % of the rainy season. The mean coverage of erosion crusts for two rainy seasons was 26 % upslope, compared with 11 % and 15 % midslope and downslope, respectively. Weeding, carried out manually with hand hoes, had a very positive effect on soil infiltrability. The destruction of surface crusts resulted in zero Roff (Kr = 0) for rainstorms directly following weeding operations. However, surface crusts were quickly re-established {{as a result of the}} erosive effect of the following storms. Large volumes of runon (Ron) water were measured at the upslope limit of the field (14. 4 m 3 /m in 1995, corresponding to a rainfall depth of 47. 5 mm if redistributed over the 8. 5 ha millet field). Small volumes were registered downslope (Ron = 0. 75 m 3 /m), indicating redistribution of Ron along the hillslope. The Ron originated from the upstream degraded fallow zone and the adjacent sparsely vegetated plateau, which in effect functioned as water-harvesting zones. Roff was modelled based on field observations of surface coverage of soil crusts, data on hydraulic characteristics for the observed crusts, rainfall data and estimates of antecedent soil moisture [...] .

This paper aims at characterizing water use in a set of paddies located in the central Ebro basin of Spain using experimentation and computer simulation. A commercial field with six interconnected paddies, with a total area of 5. 31  ha, was instrumented to measure discharge and water quality at the inflow and at the runoff outlet. The soil was classified <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Typic</b> Calcixerept, and was characterized by a mild salinity (2. 5 dS m- 1) and an infiltration rate of 5. 8 mm day- 1. The evolution of flow depth at all paddies was recorded. Data from the 2002 rice-growing season was elaborated using a mass balance approach to estimate the infiltration rate and the evolution of discharge between paddies. Seasonal crop evapotranspiration, estimated with the surface renewal method, was 731 mm (5. 1 mm day- 1), very similar to that of other summer cereals grown in the area, like corn. The irrigation input was 1874 mm, deep percolation was 830 mm and surface runoff was 372 mm. Irrigation efficiency was estimated as 41 %. The quality of surface runoff water was slightly degraded due to evapoconcentration and to the contact with the soil. During the period 2001 - 2003, the electrical conductivity of surface runoff water was 54 % higher than that of irrigation water. However, the runoff water was suitable for irrigation. A mechanistic mass balance model of inter-paddy water flow permitted to conclude that improvements in irrigation efficiency cannot be easily obtained in the experimental conditions. Since deep percolation losses more than double surface runoff losses, a reduction in irrigation discharge would not have much room for efficiency improvement. Simulations also showed that rice irrigation performance was not negatively affected by the fluctuating inflow hydrograph. These hydrographs are typical of turnouts located {{at the tail end of}} tertiary irrigation ditches. In fact, these are the sites where rice has been historically cultivated in the study area, since local soils are often saline-sodic and can only grow paddy rice taking advantage of the low salinity of the irrigation water. The low infiltration rate characteristic of these saline-sodic soils (an experimental value of 3. 2 mm day- 1 was obtained) combined with a reduced irrigation discharge resulted in a simulated irrigation efficiency of 60 %. Paddy rice irrigation efficiency can attain reasonable values in the local saline-sodic soils, where the infiltration rate is clearly smaller than the average daily rice evapotranspiration. ...|$|E
40|$|O fósforo é um dos nutriente mais {{important}}e na produção de alfafa nos solos brasileiros. Diversas fontes de P são disponíveis no mercado e o fosfato de Gafsa (FG) é considerado tão eficiente como solúvel. A eficiência dos adubos fosfatados é afetada pela acidez do solo. O uso do gesso associado ao FG pode corrigir o perfil do solo em relação ao alumínio e diminuir a fixação do P no solo. Portanto, o objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar num experimento em vasos a eficiência do superfosfato triplo (ST), do FG e do FG com gesso, aplicados antes e depois da calagem, nas doses de 50, 100 e 200 mg P dm- 3. Foi utilizado um solo classificado como LATOSSOLO VERMELHO-AMARELO Alumínico. Foram efetuados três plantios de alfafa, realizando-se um corte no primeiro plantio e três cortes no terceiro. Com o ST obteve-se maior produção de matéria seca (MS) (3, 3 g/vaso) do que com o FG (1, 0 g/vaso) no primeiro plantio. Mas no terceiro plantio ocorreu menor produção de MS com o uso do ST (2, 4 g/vaso) do que com o FG (6, 0 g/vaso). O gesso com FG elevou a produção de MS (7, 0 g/vaso) em relação ao FG (3, 7 g/vaso) no terceiro plantio. A aplicação do ST depois da calagem aumentou a produção de MS (5, 0 g/vaso) comparado a aplicação antes da calagem (3, 7 g/vaso), no primeiro plantio.

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 Extractable {{forms of}} Al and Fe were studied in five soils from the Coast Range, {{and in two}} soils from the Willamette Valley in Oregon. Exchangeable Al was {{determined}} {{in a way which}} permitted a comparison of three different methods for its determination. Values for exchangeable Al obtained by the method of lirrited leaching by Lin and Coleman (1960) agreed closely with those obtained by the method of Skeen and Sumner (1965) which consists of successive extractions and extrapolation to obtain the exchangeable Al content. Values for exchangeable Al measured by the method of exhaustive leaching proposed by Dewan and Rich (1970) exceeded the Coleman values in different amounts depending on the amount of exchangeable Al present, and on the final slope of the extraction curves. Steep slopes were found in coastal soils containing amorphous aluminosilicates, indicating that these soils have a strong supplying power for exchangeable Al, From the shape of the Al extraction curves it was concluded that two different forms of Al were extracted by the method of successive extractions, namely, a readily exchangeable form, and a form that is slowly released and which presumably results from mineral solution of amorphous oxides or from Al-organic complexes. In soils with a high base saturation good agreement between both the Coleman and the Rich values for exchangeable cations with the neutral salt CEC was observed. In soils in which Al is the dominant cation of the exchange complex, the neutral salt CEC was from 2 to 3 meq lower than the Coleman value for exchangeable cations. These differences were attributed to errors in the CEC determination due to hydrolysis. The Rich values for exchangeable cations exceeded the neutral salt CEC by amounts as high as 10 meq/ 100 g. It was therefore concluded that Rich's method to determine exchangeable Al furnishes values that are not compatible with other standard methods. The ratios of humic to fulvic acid extracted by pyrophosphate were higher in grassland soils than in forest soils. The total amounts of Al and Fe correlate fairly well with the organic carbon extracted by pyrophosphate. The contents of Al and Fe were much higher in fulvic acid than in humic acid, but this was ascribed to the formation of soluble complexes of previously organically bound Al and Fe with pyrophosphate appearing in the fulvic fraction. It was concluded that pyrophosphate extractable Al and Fe represent a rough estimate of the amounts of Al and Fe involved in cation bridges. The ratio of Al or Fe to organic carbon extracted by pyrophosphate increased with depth. This could be due either to a change in organic matter composition, or a result of increased dissolution of inorganic amorphous oxides in lower horizons. In the top horizons of soils high in organic matter the absolute amounts of pyrophosphate extractable Al and Fe were much higher than in soils low in organic matter. However, the metal to organic carbon ratios in the top horizons were fairly similar. This suggests that the proportions of organic matter bonded to inorganic surfaces by cation bridges have similar contents of polyvalent cations. It was therefore concluded that differences in organic matter accumulations should be explained in terms of the kinds and amounts of inorganic surfaces available for organic matter adsorption in a soil. In previous work,the coastal soils with high organic matter accumulations have been shown to contain amorphous alumino-silicates. These minerals are unique in that they combine negative charges and an aluminous surface with a high specific surface area. Thus, they favor the formation of all the known types of organo-mineral bonds, except anion exchange. The oxalate and dithionite extractions did not yield much information, and were difficult to interpret due to uncertainties regarding their presumed specificity for pedogenetic oxides. However, dithionite in conjunction with pyrophosphate appears to be useful for the chemical identification of spodic horizons. The classification of the Knappa and the Nehalern profiles did not correspond to the official series classification. The Knappa profile was classified <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Typic</b> Dystrandept instead of a Pachic Haplumbrept. The Nehalern profile was found {{to be a member of}} the Fluventic.

This behavior is related to the high amount of organic matter (OM) and amorphous iron and aluminum oxides content on soil ST, whereas soil SR had the lowest OM content and specific surface area of the soils of this study. Addition of exogenous OM to soils caused an increase in the 2, 4 -D adsorption by three of the soils treated with UWC, with the only exception being ST soil, due to an observed decrease in its specific surface area.

50|$|Polecats {{were found}} in two major phenotypes <b>a</b> <b>typic</b> one and <b>a</b> dark fur one with no black mask. Colour {{mutations}} include albinos and erythrists. In typical erythristic individuals, the underfur is usually bright reddish. The guard hairs on the trunk are bright reddish or reddish brown. Black guard hairs are absent on the lower body and head. In some rare cases, the guard hairs are so light, they are almost indistinguishable from the pale-yellow underfur. In these cases, the whole animal is a very light golden-yellow colour.|$|R
40|$|In Brazil, grazing {{mismanagement}} {{may lead}} to soil and pasture degradation. To impede this process, integrated cropping systems such as silvopasture have been an effective alternative, allied with precision agriculture based on soil mapping for site-specific management. In this study, we aimed to define the soil property that best sheds light on the variability of eucalyptus and forage yield. The experiment was conducted in the 2011 / 12 crop year in Ribas do Rio Pardo, Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil. We analyzed linear and spatial correlations between eucalyptus traits and physical properties of <b>a</b> <b>Typic</b> Quartzipsamment at two depths (0. 00 - 0. 10 and 0. 10 - 0. 20 m). For that purpose, {{we set up a}} geostatistical grid for collection at 72 points. Gravimetric moisture in the 0. 00 - 0. 10 m layer is an important index of soil physical quality, showing correlation to eucalyptus circumference at breast height (CBH) in <b>a</b> <b>Typic</b> Quartzipsamment. With <b>an</b> increase in resistance to penetration in the soil surface layer, there is an increase in eucalyptus height and in neutral detergent fiber content in the forage crop. From a spatial point of view, the height of eucalyptus and the neutral detergent fiber of forage can be estimated by co-kriging analysis with soil resistance to penetration. Resistance to penetration values above 2. 3 MPa indicated higher yielding sites...|$|R

40|$|Sewage sludge from {{wastewater}} treatment contains organic matter and plant nutrients that {{can play an}} important role in agricultural production and the maintenance of soil fertility, The present study has aimed to evaluate the degree of humification following sewage sludge application of soil organic matter by laser-induced fluorescence and humic acids using ultraviolet-visible fluorescence, and including comparison with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Sewage sludge applications to the soil caused a decrease in the degree of humification of the soil organic matter and humic acids for both <b>a</b> <b>Typic</b> Eutrorthox (clayey) soil and <b>a</b> <b>Typic</b> Haplorthox (sandy) soil of around 14 and 27 %, respectively. This effect is probably clue to incorporation of newly formed humic substances from the sewage sludge into the characteristics of less humified material, and to the indigenous soil humic substances. The minor alterations observed in the clay soil probably occurred due to both the greater mineral association, which better stabilized the indigenous soil organic matter, and the higher microbial activity in this soil, which accelerated sewage sludge mineralization. Sewage sludge applications increased the C content for the clay and sandy soils by 7. 4 and 15. 4 g kg(- 1), respectively, suggesting a positive effect on these two soils.

40|$|In this research, we {{have studied}} the {{accumulation}} of four PTEs (Cadmium, copper, lead and zinc) during and after biosolid application, in two soils with different clay content and their eventual movement with depth. The study was performed in the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina, on <b>a</b> <b>Typic</b> Argiudoll and on <b>a</b> <b>Typic</b> Hapludoll. Treatments were: control and biosolid application, at doses of 14 Mg ha - 1 year - 1 (dry matter). There were two types of sampling: (i) Topsoil sampling, at 0 - 0. 15 m depth, taken throughout five years and (ii) Depth soil sampling at regular intervals of 0. 33 m from top soil to 3 - 4 m depth, taken two years after biosolid application. All samples were taken on April. PTEs, extracted hydrochloric, sulfuric and nitric acids (total) or extracted with DiethyleneTriaminePentaacetic acid-DTPA (available), were determined by ICP. Total concentrations of PTEs in topsoils of both soils did not increase significantly due to biosolid application. The exception was the significantly high Pb concentration in the Typic Hapludoll. DTPA extractable metals showed some concentration changes throughout the studied period. Total and available PTEs did not show mobility with the depth of both soils. The exception was total Cd in the Typic Argiudoll, which moved in depth. With only those two exceptions, there is neither PTEs accumulation in topsoils nor PTEs movements in soil depth. The first {{could be attributed to}} biosolid composition and dosage used in the region. The lack of movement in depth appears more related to the characteristics of the studied soils...|$|R

50|$|The great group {{categories}} {{are divided into}} three kinds of soil subgroups: typic, intergrade and extragrade. <b>A</b> <b>typic</b> subgroup represents the basic or 'typical' concept of the great group to which the described subgroup belongs. An intergrade subgroup describes the properties that suggest how it grades towards (is similar to) soils of other soil great groups, suborders or orders. These properties are not developed or expressed well enough to cause the soil to be included within the great group towards which they grade, but suggest similarities. Extragrade features are aberrant properties which prevent that soil from being included in another soil classification. About 1,000 soil subgroups are defined in the United States.|$|R

O experimento foi instalado em Latossolo Vermelho Aluminoférrico típico e Latossolo Vermelho distrófico típico sob cinco diferentes culturas: pinus, eucalipto, citrus, soja e milho. As amostragens de solo foram efetuadas mensalmente, de abril de 1990 a março de 1991, determinando-se a atividade da urease, o N-total e o C-orgânico. A atividade da urease variou de acordo com a época de amostragem, apresentando valores mais elevados nos meses mais quentes e úmidos. A cobertura vegetal influenciou a conversão de N-uréia a N-NH 4, observando-se maior atividade da urease nas amostras de solo sob pinus e eucalipto, embora, no início do ciclo das culturas da soja e do milho, a atividade da urease também tenha sido elevada.
