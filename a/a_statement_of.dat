5|$|According to {{historian}} David Armitage, the Declaration of Independence did {{prove to}} be internationally influential, but not as <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> human rights.

The automobile and the Interstate became the American symbol of individuality and freedom, and, for the first time, automobile buyers accepted that the automobile they drove indicated their social standing and level of affluence.

5|$|The {{antiquarian}} William Lambarde, for example, published what {{he believed}} were the Anglo-Saxon and Norman law codes, tracing {{the origins of the}} 16th-century English Parliament back to this period, albeit misinterpreting the dates of many documents concerned. Francis Bacon argued that clause 39 of Magna Carta was the basis of the 16th-century jury system and judicial processes. Antiquarians Robert Beale, James Morice, and Richard Cosin argued that Magna Carta was <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> liberty and a fundamental, supreme law empowering English government. Those who questioned these conclusions, including the Member of Parliament Arthur Hall, faced sanctions.|$|E
5|$|The cadet pledge was {{considered}} <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> intention {{rather than a}} binding contract. The attrition rate for cadets was comparable to that reported for other schools of nursing in the same period. The main cause of withdrawals was homesickness; some married students withdrew {{to be with their}} husbands when they were released from the military; others when the hostilities ceased; some failed in their studies; others left for health reasons; and some left because of the realities of a nursing career.|$|E

Nevertheless, by considering the larger legal context of the lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s role, by understanding inconsistent ethical rules {{in the light of}} reason, and by applying insights of moral philosophy, this article concludes that there are circumstances in which a lawyer can ethically make <b>a</b> false <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> fact to <b>a</b> tribunal, can ethically make <b>a</b> false <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> material fact to a third person, and can ethically engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation...|$|R

5|$|Archbishop Davidson had {{no doubts}} about Henson's doctrinal soundness, and {{persuaded him to}} issue <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> faith to silence his critics. Davidson stated {{publicly}} that no fair-minded man could read consecutively a series of Henson's sermons without feeling that they had in him a brilliant and powerful teacher of the Christian faith. Gore and his followers were obliged to call off their protests. Against Davidson's advice for caution, Lloyd George appointed Henson to the vacant see of Hereford in 1917. Gore and others, including Cosmo Lang, now the Archbishop of York, failed to attend the consecration service. Their attitude hurt Henson, offended lay opinion in the Church, and was sharply criticised in The Times. Henson was consecrated bishop in Westminster Abbey on 4 February 1918 by Davidson, assisted by twelve supporting bishops. He was enthroned at Hereford Cathedral eight days later.|$|E
5|$|Between 1997 and 2000 Mosley {{repeatedly}} {{warned that}} if any EU decision went against the FIA, the marketing organisations and F1 itself would be moved out of Europe. In 1999, the EU Commission Directorate-General for Competition issued <b>a</b> <b>Statement</b> <b>of</b> Objections, listing a number of grievances surrounding the FIA's dealings with Ecclestone and Formula One. The FIA released the Statement {{to the media and}} held a press conference in Brussels ridiculing the Commission’s case. The Commission argued that a number of commercial agreements could be viewed as anti-competition and invited the FIA and Ecclestone's companies, ISC and FOA, to submit proposals to modify these arrangements. In 2001, nine months after settlement talks had begun, the parties reached an agreement to amend existing contracts, which included Ecclestone stepping down as the FIA's vice-president of promotional affairs and the FIA ending all involvement in the commercial activities of Formula One.|$|E
