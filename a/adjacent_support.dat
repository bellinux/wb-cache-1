Therefore, if these hairs become damaged, through prolonged exposure to excessive sound levels, for instance, then deafness to certain frequencies results.

If this should occur, the solar image will travel across the aperture plate, and it may also impinge on the <b>adjacent</b> <b>support</b> structure. Such an event is called 'sun walk-off'. The present investigation is concerned with the transient response of different aperture plate materials to the intense heating produced in a typical walk-off situation for parabolic dish concentrators. Receivers for two solar module systems are considered, including a high-temperature receiver that utilizes a 2 -milliradian (mrad) concentrator, and a lower-temperature receiver which is coupled with a 4 -mrad concentrator. It is found that during a walk-off situation the solar image travels in a straight line in the radial direction. The results obtained for a copper aperture plate were disappointing.

40|$|As {{buildings}} inevitably {{increase in}} height, vertical support elements (e. g. columns and shear walls) in tall buildings {{are required to}} carry vertical load increments {{from a number of}} floors. Therefore, axial shortening of vertical elements due to long term creep and shrinkage effects is inevitable in reinforced concrete buildings. However, the calculation of reliable values for axial shortening is not a straight forward task. All parameters may be uncertain or may not be available at the design stage. Recently, engineers have also become concerned with differential shortening of adjacent vertical elements, particularly in the lower and basement levels of super high rise structures. Largely varied values and rates for axial shortening of <b>adjacent</b> <b>support</b> elements is not only a concern for vertical deformation, but can critically impact on the performance of horizontal structural elements such as beams and slabs.

40|$|An {{apparatus}} for rejecting {{waste heat}} from a system located {{on or near}} the lunar equator is presented. The system utilizes a reflective catenary shaped trough deployed about a vertical radiator to shade the radiator from heat emitted by the hot lunar surface. The catenary shaped trough is constructed from a film material and is aligned relative to the sun so that incoming solar energy is focused to a line just above the vertical radiator and can thereby isolate the radiator from the effects of direct sunlight. The film is in a collapsed position between side by side support rods, all of which are in a transport case. To deploy the film and support rods, a set of parallel tracks running perpendicular to length of the support rods are extended out from the transport case. After the support tracks are deployed, the support rods are positioned equidistant from each other {{along the length of the}} support tracks so that the flexible film shade between <b>adjacent</b> <b>support</b> rods is unfolded and hangs in a catenary shaped trough. A heat radiator is supported between each pair of support rods above each hanging reflective trough...|$|E
40|$|SummaryWhen {{nutrient}} availability becomes limited, animals must actively adjust their metabolism to allocate limited resources and maintain tissue homeostasis [1 – 3]. However, it is poorly understood how tissues maintained by {{adult stem cells}} respond to chronic changes in metabolism. To begin to address this question, we fed flies a diet lacking protein (protein starvation) and assayed both germline and intestinal stem cells. Our results revealed a decrease in stem cell proliferation {{and a reduction in}} stem cell number; however, a small pool of active stem cells remained. Upon refeeding, stem cell number increased dramatically, indicating that the remaining stem cells are competent to respond quickly to changes in nutritional status. Stem cell maintenance is critically dependent upon intrinsic and extrinsic factors that act to regulate stem cell behavior [4]. Activation of the insulin/IGF signaling pathway in stem cells and <b>adjacent</b> <b>support</b> cells in the germline was sufficient to suppress stem cell loss during starvation. Therefore, our data indicate that stem cells can directly sense changes in the systemic environment to coordinate their behavior with the nutritional status of the animal, providing a paradigm for maintaining tissue homeostasis under metabolic stress...|$|E

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{known as}} the 'arching effect' occurs when a portion of granular mass yields relative to an adjacent stationary region. The movement is resisted by shearing stresses which act to reduce {{the pressure on the}} yielding support and increase the pressure on the adjacent stationary supporting zones. Arching is widely observed in both natural and man-made structures such as piled embankments, tunnels, and above mine works and sinkholes. One method of increasing soil shear strength and its resistance to deformation is through the use of randomly distributed discrete fibres. The degree of improvement {{has been shown to be}} directly related to the fibre content in the soil, the fibre aspect ratio, orientation and mechanical properties. In this research the arching effect is recreated in a geotechnical centrifuge model using a 'trapdoor' apparatus within a plane strain container and the effect of fibre reinforcement on results is examined.

40|$|A dilemma often {{encountered}} in decontamination and decommissioning operations {{is the lack}} of choice as to the location where the work is to be performed. Facility siting, laboratory location, and <b>adjacent</b> <b>support</b> areas were often determined based on criteria, which while appropriate at the time, are not always the most conducive to a D&D project. One must learn to adapt and cope with as found conditions. High priority research activities, which cannot be interrupted, may be occurring in adjacent non-radiological facilities in the immediate vicinity where highly contaminated materials must be handled {{in the course of a}} D&D operation. The execution of a project within such an environment involves a high level of coordination, cooperation, professionalism and flexibility among the project, the work force and the surrounding occupants. Simply moving occupants from the potentially affected area is not always an option and much consideration must be given in the selection of the D&D methodology to be employed and the processes to be implemented. Determining project boundaries and the ensuring that adjacent occupants are included in the planning/scheduling of specific operations which impact their work area are important in the development of the safety envelope. Such was the case in the recent D&D of 61 gloveboxes contaminated with plutonium and other transuranic nuclides at the Argonne National Laboratory-East site. The gloveboxes, which were used in Department of Energy research and development program activities over the past 30 years, were decontaminated to below transuranic waste criteria, size reduced, packaged and removed from Building 212 by Argonne National Laboratory personnel in conjunction with Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc. with essentially no impact to adjacent occupants...|$|E

Computing the area under the precision-recall curve requires interpolating between <b>adjacent</b> <b>supporting</b> points, but previous interpolation schemes are not directly applicable to weighted data. Hence, even in cases where weights were available, they had to be neglected for assessing classifiers using precision-recall curves.

We investigate accordances and differences of the proposed interpolation and previous ones, and we demonstrate that taking into account existing weights of test data is important for the comparison of classifiers...|$|R
40|$|At {{the wake}} of the Columbia (STS- 107) {{accident}} it was decided to remove the Protuberance Aerodynamic Load (PAL) Ramp that was originally intended to protect various protuberances outside of the Space Shuttle External Tank from high buffet load induced by cross-flows at transonic speed. In order to establish the buffet load without the PAL ramp, a wind tunnel test was conducted where segments of the protuberances were instrumented with dynamic pressure transducers; and power-spectra of sectional lift and drag forces at various span-wise locations between two <b>adjacent</b> <b>support</b> brackets were measured under different cross flow angles, Mach number and other conditions. Additionally, frequency-dependent spatial correlations between the sectional forces were also established. The sectional forces were then adjusted by the correlation length to establish span-averaged spectra of normal and lateral forces that can be suitably "added" to various other unsteady forces encountered by the protuberance. This paper describes the methodology used for calculating the correlation-adjusted power spectrum of the buffet load. A second part of the paper describes wind-tunnel results on the difference in the buffet load on the protuberances with and without the PAL ramp. In general when the ramp height is {{the same as that of}} the protuberance height, such as that found on the liquid Oxygen part of the tank, the ramp is found to cause significant reduction of the unsteady aerodynamic load.

This study therefore assessed the challenges of buffer zone management in some (<b>adjacent)</b> <b>support</b> zone communities in Oban Division of Cross River National Park, Nigeria. Data were obtained through questionnaire interviews and reconnaissance survey and subjected to descriptive and inferential statistical analysis. Results showed that a high percentage (68. 68 %) of the respondents in the division were not aware of the existence of the buffer zone and the policies governing it. 74. 42 % believed that the Park has left them poorer.

A chi-square analysis showed that the people were not aware of the existence, creation and policy governing buffer zone management and were therefore not in favour of its operations. These developments might be adduced to the low level of awareness of Park laws and buffer zone management policies by these communities. It is therefore recommended that public enlightenment campaigns should be stepped up to educate the populace on the need to abide by the laws and policies governing the Park and its buffer zone.

A motor driven ‘trapdoor’ apparatus was built inside a plane strain container to model the yielding support. Both the trapdoor and an <b>adjacent</b> <b>support</b> were instrumented to measure the force (and derived pressure) distribution.

One method of increasing soil shear strength and its resistance to deformation is the reinforcement of soil with randomly distributed discrete fibres. The degree of improvement {{has been shown to be}} directly related to the fibre content in the soil, the fibre aspect ratio, orientation and mechanical properties. In this research the effect of fibre reinforcement on the arching process and resulting deformation is examined by variation of fibre parameters such as fibre aspect ratio and volumetric content of fibre. The influence of fibre and model scale effects were investigated by conducting a modelling of models exercise whereby trapdoor scale and effective stress were varied whilst maintaining a constant cover depth to structure width ratio, and compaction effort.
