40|$|In {{the last}} decade, the European air {{transport}} industry {{has undergone a}} process in several stages of transition towards a single market. Liberalization has been {{closely linked to the}} effective application of the state aid rules of the EC Treaty. In principle, direct <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> <b>undertakings</b> within the common market is not prohibited by the state aid rules in the Treaty. However, aid granted by Member States that distorts or threatens to distort competition by giving one airline an unfair advantage over its competitors, and in so far as it affects trade between Member States, is incompatible with the Treaty. Certain mandatory or discretionary exemptions may apply to aid to airlines providing that the measure fulfills the conditions and requirements as stated by the Treaty. The European Commission and the EFTA Surveillance Authority have a wide discretion in deciding whether or not certain aid measures fall within the stated exemptions. Where the market forces alone are not able to achieve the desired results or if they are only able to do so in a limited capacity, such exemptions may be warranted to the extent not contrary to the common interest. A special mechanism is in place to ensure that state aid is properly scrutinized {{in the light of the}} demands of the Treaty and the EEA Agreement. The EC Commission or the EFTA Surveillance Authority must be notified of all aid measures in order to assess their compatibility with state aid rules...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of the recent financial crisis on EU state aid policy and regulation. The crisis necessitated the granting of significant amounts of government aid to banks that had encountered financial difficulties. The thesis describes the changes that the crisis produced in the legal framework for controlling state aid to distressed financial institutions in the EU. The analysis includes a discussion of certain significant state aid decisions concerning state aid to banks during the crisis. The thesis also discusses whether the Commission’s actions during the crisis departed significantly from the state aid control policy that the Commission had developed prior to the crisis. The theoretical framework of the thesis is based on discussions concerning the economic rationale for controlling state aid. Usually it is argued that state aid needs to be controlled because it has the potential of decreasing the economic efficiency of undertakings, which results in welfare losses for the economy as a whole. State aid control is also deemed necessary in order to secure a level playing field for actors from different Member states and thus to foster market integration. However, state aid control may also be justified in order to promote aid that corrects market failures or aid that aims to promote certain equity objectives. Thus, the aims pursued by state aid policy are multiple and have at times conflicted with one another. The promotion of financial stability, the stated aim of granting state aid to banks during the recent crisis, can be understood as a case of using aid in order to address a market failure (the financial instability resulting from a bank’s bankruptcy) and thus as an efficient use of state aid. The legal rules applied to the control of state aid in normal times are briefly described in the thesis. It is observed that so called rescue and restructuring (R&R) aid is usually considered {{to be one of the}} most harmful forms of aid and the Commission has thus in the past underlined that it should only be granted in exceptional situations. The analysis of the Commission’s decisional practice concerning aid to banks prior to the crisis clearly shows that the Commission has been willing to apply standard state aid rules to banks as well, yet however taking into account the specific significance of the banking sector for the economy as a whole. This might be understood to imply that the safeguarding of financial stability is not an aim that was completely foreign to state aid policy even prior the crisis. Banks that received aid prior to the recent crisis were also subject to strict remedies aimed at addressing potential distortions of competition, such as asset reductions, branch closures and behavioural constraints. The thesis then moves on to discuss the crisis legal framework put in place by the Commission from late- 2008 onwards. The content of these so called Crisis Communications is discussed. It is observed that even though the Commission did at certain points depart significantly from the standard legal framework for granting R&R <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> <b>undertakings</b> (most notably by introducing the distinction between fundamentally sound and unsound undertakings), the basic characteristics of state aid control regulation remained in place throughout the crisis. The amendments to the standard regime also gradually became less significant, as the crisis regime evolved with the adoption of the Restructuring Communication in August 2010. This continuity in the Commission’s approach is evidenced also by the analysis of certain key decisions by the Commission during the crisis, which shows that the aided banks had to accept remedies that resemble closely the ones applied already prior to the crisis, the former being in certain cases even harsher. It is clear that the Commission was not willing to let significant distortions of competition arise as a result of maintaining financial stability. In the final chapter of the thesis the recent development of EU banking regulation is briefly described. This development aims to make sure that in the future financial crises will not be dealt with government aid but instead with resources granted by the financial institutions themselves. As a conclusion, it is argued that the Commission was in its actions during the crisis trying to pursue two distinct policy aims, namely the safeguarding of financial stability and the avoidance of distortions of competition. This dual policy aim might also explain why the Commission’s actions have attracted some criticism, since the aim of promoting financial stability does not fit easily together with state aid control’s traditional policy objective, the promotion of competition...|$|E

40|$|During the {{financial}} crisis the European Commission interpreted the rules on state aids in a flexible way, making legally possible for EU Member States to support {{the financial}} sector. This approach was justified {{by the need to}} preserve the banking sector from the concrete danger of a downfall, {{as well as by the}} aim of preventing unnecessary and disproportionate distortions of competition among financial institutions, within the European single market. The same approach was later adopted also in the so called real economy, in order to restore a normal lending activity <b>to</b> non-financial <b>undertakings.</b> However, only the Member States with sound public finances receive a competitive benefit from the flexible interpretation and application of state aid rules. On the other hand, the Member States whose public accounts figures are close to, or beyond, the limits on government deficit (3 % of GDP) and debt (60 % of GDP) submitted to an excessive deficit procedure, and those who are submitted to a formal excessive deficit procedure, have little or no chance to grant any form of <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> national <b>undertakings.</b> Since {{the financial crisis}} is about to come to an end, the Commission should abandon its flexible approach <b>to</b> state <b>aid</b> rules, that is likely to increase the asymmetries among the economies of different Member States...|$|R

Otherwise (when the competence of the national judge may jeopardize the assessment of the European Commission and its positive decision), the recovery obligation is converted in (or downgraded to) a faculty of recovery. The procedural dimension of Article 108 (3) TFEU is weakened. The CELF approach suggests that the European Commission is the true core of the State aid supervision system. However the deterrence of the ban of State aid, and the effectiveness of Article 108 (3) TFEU' private enforcement (whereof aid recovery is the main strand) seems to be in future, despite the aims of the reform, seriously at risk...|$|R
