500|$|In January 2010, Goddard {{stated that}} [...] "at the {{beginning}} {{there was some}} contact. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>recall,</b> {{we were going to}} do a session with one of her writers" [...] but both Hot Chip and Minogue were too busy at the time. He added [...] "there was a grain of truth in the beginning, but then it all snowballed into some big silly thing". When asked, in 2010, about giving a song to Minogue, he stated that it would be [...] "amazing".|$|E
500|$|In 1912, the Guild of Poets {{published}} {{her book}} of verse Evening (Vecher) – {{the first of}} five in nine years. The small edition of 500 copies quickly sold out and she received around a dozen positive notices in the literary press. She exercised a strong selectivity for the pieces – including only 35 of the 200 poems she had written {{by the end of}} 1911. (She noted that Song of the Last Meeting, dated 29 September 1911, was her 200th poem). The book secured her reputation as a new and striking young writer, the poems Grey-eyed king, In the Forest, Over the Water and I don’t need my legs anymore making her famous. She later wrote [...] "These naïve poems by a frivolous girl for some reason were reprinted thirteen times [...] And they came out in several translations. The girl herself (as far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>recall)</b> did not foresee such a fate for them and used to hide the issues of the journals in which they were first published under the sofa cushions".|$|E
500|$|I {{was visiting}} {{my friend and}} generous benefactor, Prof. Edward C. Pickering. With {{characteristic}} kindness, he had volunteered to have the spectra observed for all the stars—including comparison stars—which had been observed in the observations for stellar parallax which Hinks and I made at Cambridge, and I discussed. This piece of apparently routine work proved very fruitful—it led to the discovery that all the stars of very faint absolute magnitude were of spectral class M. In conversation on this subject (<b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> it), I asked Pickering about certain other faint stars, not on my list, mentioning in particular 40 Eridani B. Characteristically, he sent a note to the Observatory office and before long the answer came (I think from Mrs Fleming) that the spectrum of this star was A. I knew enough about it, even in these paleozoic days, to realize at once {{that there was an}} extreme inconsistency between what we would then have called [...] "possible" [...] values of the surface brightness and density. I must have shown that I was not only puzzled but crestfallen, at this exception to what looked like a very pretty rule of stellar characteristics; but Pickering smiled upon me, and said: [...] "It is just these exceptions that lead to an advance in our knowledge", and so the white dwarfs entered the realm of study! ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Then my {{reports have}} all been wasted!"--My voice trembled <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>recalled</b> the pains and the pride with which I had {{composed}} them.|$|R

500|$|In 1932, Chuck Kocsis (the first golfer {{inducted}} into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor), enrolled at the university. When a promised alumni pledge to pay his expenses fell through, Trueblood agreed to make a loan (at five percent interest) so Kocsis could pay his tuition. The Wolverines with Kocsis won the NCAA championship twice. Kocsis recalled that the team often traveled to tournaments in Trueblood's car. [...] "Professor Trueblood had a seven-passenger Buick," [...] Kocsis said. [...] "He designated me as the chauffeur. So {{if we had a}} golf match, we'd all get into the car and go to Chicago, or go to Ohio, wherever we were going to play." [...] Another teammate recalled the trips in Trueblood's car: [...] "It wasn't a very big Buick, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>recall.</b> [...] We rode with six guys. Chuck used to do most of the driving. I remember that trip down to Washington (for the 1935 national championship at Congressional, which Michigan won). We started in the morning and drove all the way down there. Professor Trueblood was a big guy, too." [...] Trueblood took the team on a side trip to Mount Vernon, where one of the players accidentally bumped the shifter into gear and hit the accelerator as he exited Trueblood's car. The car lurched forward; the open door hit something and was torn off its hinges.|$|E
2500|$|McCartney {{was living}} in Jane Asher's parents' house when he found the {{inspiration}} for the song: [...] "I was laying in bed in the Ashers' garret... I was thinking of it as a song for Ringo, which it eventually turned out to be, so I wrote it as not too rangey in the vocal, then started making a story, sort of an ancient mariner, telling the young kids where he'd lived. It was pretty much my song <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>recall...</b> I think John helped out. The lyrics got more and more obscure as it goes on, but the chorus, melody and verses are mine." [...] The song began as being about different coloured submarines, but evolved to include only a yellow one.|$|E
2500|$|Members of Image Ten were {{involved}} in filming and post-production, participating in loading camera magazines, gaffing, constructing props, recording sounds and editing. Production stills were shot and printed by Karl Hardman, who stated {{in an interview that}} a [...] "number of cast members formed a production line in the darkroom for developing, washing and drying of the prints as I made the exposures. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>recall,</b> I shot over 1,250 pictures during the production". Upon completion of post-production, Image Ten found it difficult to secure a distributor willing to show the film with the gruesome scenes intact. Columbia and American International Pictures declined after requests to soften it and re-shoot the final scene were rejected by producers. Romero admitted that [...] "none of us wanted to do that. We couldn't imagine a happy ending.... Everyone want a Hollywood ending, but we stuck to our guns". The Manhattan-based Walter Reade Organization agreed to show the film uncensored, but changed the title from Night of the Flesh Eaters to Night of the Living Dead because a film had already been produced under a similar title to the former. While changing the title, the copyright notice was accidentally deleted from the early releases of the film.|$|E
60|$|The advice {{came too}} late. Clawbonny was mortgaged already, and I confess to several new and violent twinges, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>recalled</b> the fact, while Marble was telling his story. Still I could not liken my kinsman, plain-talking, warm-hearted, family-loving, John Wallingford, {{to such a}} griping usurer as Mrs. Wetmore's persecutor.|$|R
60|$|And {{presently}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>recalled</b> what talks we had had, and one {{in particular}} from which it now appeared to me that her coldness had sprung, a light seemed suddenly to break upon my mind, as perchance it hath long ago broken upon {{the minds of those}} who may happen upon these pages, and whose wits in matters amorous are of a keener temper than were mine.|$|R

2500|$|However, did Congress {{have the}} [...] "power to proscribe any opinion or belief {{which has not}} {{manifested}} itself in any overt act"? That raised much more serious constitutional questions, Jackson said. He agreed that [...] "The law sometimes does inquire as to mental state, but only, so far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>recall,</b> when it is incidental to, and determines the quality of, some overt act in question." [...] Citing Cramer v. United States, 325 U.S. 1 (1945), Jackson observed that the Constitution barred punishment even of the very serious crime of treason unless there was some overt act. But under the majority's decision, Jackson said, [...] "since Congress has never outlawed the political strike itself, the Court must be holding that Congress may root out mere ideas which, even if acted upon, would not result in crime." [...] That was anathema to the Constitution. Agreeing that the Bill of Rights was not a suicide pact (as the majority had pointed out), Jackson nonetheless concluded that Congress had narrower, just as effective means of preventing the violent overthrow of the government than attempting to regulate thought. [...] "I think that, under our system, it is time enough for the law to lay hold of the citizen when he acts illegally, or in some rare circumstances when his thoughts are given illegal utterance. I think we must let his mind alone." ...|$|E
2500|$|First, it is {{important}} to note that Serbia did not hand over to the Prosecution (OTP) the complete collection of SDC [...] records. For example, for the year 1995 the OTP received recordings for only about half of all the sessions held by SDC. Further, some of the SDC records were not handed over in their full stenographically recorded form but were produced as extended minutes. That means that they were shorter than steno-notes but longer than the regular minutes. The dates of the missing meetings or the meetings where this lesser form of record was provided, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>recall,</b> were significant – namely dates leading up to, surrounding and in the aftermath of the Srebrenica massacre. The full records of those meetings need yet to be provided. At the same time, these documents, significant as they are, do not constitute a single body of evidence that will explain once and for all what happened and who was culpable. They do provide a much fuller context and provide some very valuable testimonials of things that were said by Milošević and others. In their un-redacted form they would point all who are interested (not just governments and lawyers) to other documents that have never been provided and that might well be more candid than the words of those at the SD Council meetings who knew they were being recorded by a stenographer. Second, it should also be remembered that there are other protected document collections and individual documents which were, and still are, protected by direct agreements between Belgrade and the former OTP Prosecutor, i.e. they were not protected by the Trial Chamber. These documents are difficult now to identify but if and when Bosnia-Herzegovina decides to reopen the ICJ case it will be essential to require Serbia and/or the ICTY to produce all those documents for the ICJ.|$|E
2500|$|Between {{leaving the}} Moments and joining The Small Faces, Steve Marriott joined The Checkpoints. Chris Clements: [...] "He {{actually}} approached us (The Checkpoints) {{and said he}} needed to fulfill some gigs that were pending. This was in 1965, he was {{with us for a}} couple of months. We rehearsed at The Kentish Drovers in the Old Kent Road in South London. He got us to learn James Brown numbers, which at the time we weren't very up in. One particular memory sticks in my mind. When we rehearsed with him, he almost spoke the words of the song, rather than sang the words. He was listening to us, making sure we got the backing right, so he didn't put himself out vocally. But when we did the first gig with him, out came this fantastic soul voice, we all looked at each other, and our mouths fell open! When doing the gigs, we would pick him up outside the Brewery in Romford road Essex. He always had a small case with his harmonicas in. His harmonica playing was excellent. Our transport at that time was a converted ambulance, and Steve would always sit up front with the owner driver, (a man in his early 50s) rather than sit in the back talking to us. He {{seemed to me to be}} a bit of a loner. Even when I had a conversation with him, he always seemed to be looking past me, as though in a hurry to be somewhere else. He was quite a heavy smoker <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>recall.</b> We did various venues in Essex, around the Basildon area. He had no guitar, he would use our lead guitarist's red Fender Strat. Steve would put many guitar breaks in the James Brown songs. So we would all huddle around our drummer Gary Hyde who would watch Steve. When Gary stopped, we stopped, when Gary started, we started, so by using those tactics the gigs went well. We had photos taken at the various venues at that time, I wish someone would dig them out from wherever, I would love to see them." ...|$|E
60|$|Later.--He {{has just}} left me. Let me {{set down his}} words <b>as</b> closely <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can <b>recall</b> them. He began by laying several musty volumes upon my bed.|$|R
60|$|A {{thrill of}} horror ran through my heart <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>recalled</b> {{to mind the}} awful scenes that I had before {{witnessed}} at that dreadful spot. But deliverance came suddenly from a quarter whence we little expected it. During the whole of that day {{there had been an}} unusual degree of heat in the atmosphere, and the sky assumed that lurid aspect which portends a thunderstorm. Just as we were approaching the horrid temple, a growl of thunder burst overhead, and heavy drops of rain began to fall.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not in this atmosphere. But I {{am at the}} Romeike College. And <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>recalled</b> {{examining}} you <b>I</b> remembered it--minutely. You were intelligent, though unsound--about cryo-hydrates it was. Ah, {{you remember}} me now. As most young women are correct by rote and unintelligent in such questions, and as it doesn't matter a rap about anything of that sort, whether you are correct or not, {{as long as the}} mental gesture is right----" [...] He paused for a moment, as though tired of his sentence. [...] "I remembered you." ...|$|R
6000|$|She vanished. In the {{sounding}} town, [...] Will she remember too? [...] Will she recall {{the eyes of}} brown [...] <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> the blue? ...|$|E
60|$|There was something, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> it, in {{the sweet}} {{willingness}} of the Lady that was singularly appealing, and contrasted with the dull mannerless passivity of the swine.|$|E
6000|$|And if you say--"When {{was that}} Juggins?"--he {{looks at you}} in a vague way as if calculating and says,--"in 1875, or 1876, I think, as near <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> it--" ...|$|E
60|$|Would that I could warn them. I {{thought of}} the girl--doubtless she could get word to them, but how was I to {{communicate}} with her? Would she {{come to see me}} before I was killed? It seemed incredible that she should not make some slight attempt to befriend me; yet, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>recalled,</b> she had made no effort to speak with me after we had reached the village. She had hastened to her mother the moment she had been liberated. Though she had returned with the old queen, she had not spoken to me, even then. I began to have my doubts.|$|R
60|$|Although she had, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>recalled</b> {{from the}} reports of the case, been {{compelled}} some years earlier to request the Court to sever her marital relations with Vincent Jopp on the ground of calculated and inhuman brutality, in that he had callously refused, {{in spite of her}} pleadings, to take old Dr. Bennett's Tonic Swamp-Juice three times a day, her voice, as she spoke, was kind and even anxious. Badly as this man had treated her--and I remember hearing that several of the jury had been unable to restrain their tears {{when she was in the}} witness-box giving her evidence--there still seemed to linger some remnants of the old affection.|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} few frenzied weeks of the {{academic}} semester last month I came across an article I reviewed quickly and put aside, but which has lingered {{in the back of}} my mind despite the fact that I can&# 8217;t seem to find it again. Essentially, <b>as</b> a <b>I</b> <b>recall,</b> the article addressed the manner in [ [...] . ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> that I have explained, I {{was obliged}} to leave Ragnall Castle {{early the next morning}} to keep a {{shooting}} engagement. O heavens! to keep a shooting engagement! ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{not well}} that I set down very much {{concerning}} our lads, for even at this late day it makes my heart ache <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> to mind their appearance.|$|E
6000|$|... "And this is dear Richard?" [...] she cried. [...] "Philip, come at {{once and}} greet your cousin. He has not {{the look of the}} Carvels," [...] she {{continued}} volubly, [...] "but more resembles his mother, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ten years!" [...] he murmured, at last. [...] "Ten years, and I {{thought that}} at the most it could be scarce more than one!" [...] That night he told me his story--the story that I give you here as nearly {{in his own words}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can <b>recall</b> them.|$|R
6000|$|Neil Paraday {{looked at}} me with eyes—such {{pleasant}} eyes as he had—in which, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> now <b>recall</b> their expression, <b>I</b> seem to have seen a dim imagination of his fate. He was fifty years old, and his illness had been cruel, his convalescence slow. “It isn’t <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> weren’t all right.” ...|$|R
5000|$|..[...] awoke and saw {{my horse}} {{standing}} {{at my feet}} with his head bending over me. His breast and forelegs were covered with clotted blood which had flowed from an ugly bullet wound. How long he had stood there in mute appeal for sympathy and relief, I do not know--perhaps all night. But <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>recalled</b> how cruelly <b>I</b> had spurred him to the chase the evening before, how without a groan of protest he responded the best he could, and how patiently he had stood with me, all unconscious of his suffering, on that lonely, miserable watch, I was not ashamed to throw my {{arms around his neck}} and weep out of my grief and contrition[...] [...] [...] That was our final ride together.|$|R
6000|$|But Harry! {{you live}} over again, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> your image before me. I see you, plain and palpable as in life; {{and can make}} your {{existence}} obvious to others. Is he, then, dead, of whom this may be said? ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was after}} my second sleep, {{subsequent}} to {{the departure of the}} warriors, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> that I at last went to Ghak with the admission that I could no longer support the intolerable longing to be personally upon the trail of my lost love.|$|E
60|$|I smile <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> {{the feeling}} of pride with which I stepped into the 'bus {{and started for the}} Grand Central Hotel. And yet, after all, values are relative. That boy had {{something}} which I have lost. I would give much of my present knowledge of the world for the keen savor of life which filled my nostrils at that time.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the turning}} point that had been reached with Casillo's murder, Galasso stated in court: [...] "As far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can <b>recall,</b> {{that is the only}} crime we talked about in euphoric terms. Alfieri embraced the assassin and congratulated him for the courage he had shown; I know that he later gave him a Rolex." ...|$|R
60|$|The sloping {{wall of the}} pit was not {{difficult}} for an active man to climb, but I hesitated long before I trusted myself within reach of the dreadful creature which had so nearly destroyed me. How did I {{know that he was}} not lurking in the nearest clump of bushes, waiting for my reappearance? I took heart, however, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>recalled</b> a conversation between Challenger and Summerlee upon the habits of the great saurians. Both were agreed that the monsters were practically brainless, that {{there was no room for}} reason in their tiny cranial cavities, and that if they have disappeared from the rest of the world it was assuredly on account of their own stupidity, which made it impossible for them to adapt themselves to changing conditions.|$|R
6000|$|There is a sweet yet melancholy pleasure, when {{far away}} from friends and home, in {{thinking}} over happy days gone by, and dwelling on the scenes and pleasures that have passed away, perhaps for ever. So I thought and felt <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>recalled</b> to mind the fun and frolic of the Stornoway ball, and the graver mirth of the Gravesend dinner, until memory traced my course backward, step by step, to the peaceful time when I dwelt in Scotland, surrounded by the gentle inmates of my happy home. We had left the shores and the green water behind us, and were now ploughing through the blue waves of the wide Atlantic; and when I turned my straining eyes towards the faint blue line of the lessening hills, [...] "a tear unbidden trembled" [...] as the thought arose that I looked perhaps {{for the last time}} upon my dear native land.|$|R
