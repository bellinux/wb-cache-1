40|$|Azimuthal {{deviations}} of P waves, {{differences between the}} true azimuths and directions of arrivals of the initial phases, are examined by analyzing the seismetric data at the Aso Volcanological Laboratory. The recent data {{are added to the}} previous data given by Sassa [1936] and the total data exhibit a systematic <b>azimuthal</b> <b>deviation</b> with azimuth. The deviation can be interpreted by the following structural model under the Aso Caldera: a tectonic line or zone runs across the center of the caldera from east to west, the northern block inclining nearly eastwards with the dip of about 15 ° and the southern block toward NNE with the dip of about 25 ° It is also shown that the chain of the central volcanoes is situated on the tectonic line or zone and that the sky-line of the caldera rim has a similar inclination to that of each block...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Yasur volcano in the Vanuatu {{archipelago}} is {{an outstanding}} source of infrasonic waves due to its regular activity. This volcano is permanently monitored by the IS 22 infrasound station located in New Caledonia, about 400 km from it, and by one microbarometer installed close to its crater. A multiyear monitoring of Yasur is proposed to validate consistently the Naval Research Laboratory Ground to Space (NRL-G 2 S) semiempirical atmospheric model up to the stratosphere. The results of propagation modeling accurately explain seasonal changes as well as small short-timescale variations of the infrasonic observables. The <b>azimuthal</b> <b>deviation</b> is predicted with an uncertainty in general lower than 0. 5 °. The fluctuations of the trace velocity and the celerity are simulated with errors as large as 5 m/s. This study demonstrates {{that the use of}} appropriate propagation tools along with the NRL-G 2 S specifications provides accurate enough results for most of the long-range observations for the purpose of operational infrasound monitoring...|$|E
40|$|The ionospheric {{horizontal}} gradient is the variation of electron density with {{latitude and longitude}} which can cause the <b>azimuthal</b> <b>deviation</b> to the Global Positioning System (GPS) ray path. The effect of an ionospheric {{horizontal gradient}} is more pronounced in the low-latitude region (equatorial) and mid-auroral (trough) or polar regions than at mid-latitudes. However, most of the time, {{the presence of the}} ionospheric horizontal gradient will be ignored over the equatorial region. In applications that use the Differential Global Pusitiuining System (DGPS) method, this neglect can cause a significant amount of error in the final user positioning. In this work, a 30 electron density model was developed far a desired region of latitude and longitude at 350 km by using the value of electron density from the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI). This model represents the actual formation of the ionosphere in 3 D (inhomogeneous). This model then will be incorporated as the new clcckon densitys ubroutine in thc Jones 3 D Ray Tracing program in order to determinc the ionospheric horizontal gradient effect for GPS signals that passes through the equatorial ionospheric...|$|E

40|$|Factors {{that affect}} the {{visibility}} of lattice fringes include crystal orientation and thickness, as well as instrument response. As a crystal gets smaller, lattice fringes stay visible for larger deviations from the Bragg condition. Hence the persistence of fringes under tilt affects the abundance and range of lattice spacings (and angles) that one sees in an image of randomly-oriented crystals. A subset of the fringes in an image are “still-visible ” after large (e. g. 35 °) single or double axis tilts. 1 If one is looking for “new-fringes ” from the same crystal (e. g. to analyze it’s 3 D lattice parameters 2), rules for recognizing redundant fringes might also help out. Here we examine a semi-empirical model for predicting the visibility of lattice fringes after tilt, by connecting the visibility to intersection of the corresponding crystal reciprocal-lattice spot with the illuminating Ewald sphere. In particular, {{we assume that the}} fringe disappears if the angle between beam direction and lattice plane normal deviates from 90 ° by more than the half-angle α ≈ θB + tan- 1 [fd/t], where θB is the Bragg angle, d is lattice spacing, t is crystal thickness {{in the direction of the}} beam, and f is a specimen-dependent signal/noise factor of order 1. Based on the fraction of randomly-oriented crystals showing fringes, for example, f for one Au/Pd specimen was shown 3 to be ≅ 0. 95. These assumptions allow one to predict, among other things, the range of <b>azimuthal</b> <b>deviations</b> of the tilt axis from the lattice plane normal (ϕ) for which fringes will remain visible, for any given goniometer tilt from th...|$|R
40|$|The ionospheric {{horizontal}} gradient is the variation of electron density with {{latitude and longitude}} which can cause the <b>azimuthal</b> <b>deviation</b> of the Global Positioning System (GPS) ray path. The effect of an ionospheric {{horizontal gradient}} is more pronounced in the low-latitude region (equatorial) and mid-auroral (trough) or polar regions than at mid-latitudes. In this paper, the positioning improvement in differential GPS (DGPS) by mitigating the ionospheric horizontal gradient has been shown. This ionospheric horizontal gradient factor was obtained from ionospheric tomographic images or contour of Total Electron Content (TEC) from Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) in the United Kingdom (UK). Since the factor of ionospheric horizontal gradient from RAL UK’s TEC contour correlates very well with the factor of ionospheric horizontal gradient from the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI), so the factor of ionospheric horizontal gradient for the ionosphere over the equatorial region was determined from IRI. Then, this factor {{will be used to}} show DGPS positioning improvement over the equatorial region. By using the same linear gradient method approach, a significant amount of positioning improvement (15 cm) has been shown over the equatorial region for the DGPS by mitigating the ionospheric horizontal gradient...|$|E
40|$|When a {{layer is}} {{overlying}} a half-space with a tilted interface, the refraction of seismic waves {{emerging from the}} half-space generally results in their reorientation away from the vertical plane of incidence, with the following consequences: The angle of emergence at the free surface and, thus, dT/dΔ will become azimuth dependent. The apparent direction of approach of the wave front along the free surface will, in general, {{be different from the}} true azimuth. The <b>azimuthal</b> <b>deviation</b> also varies with azimuth. A general formulation for the computation of the apparent azimuth and the angle of incidence at the free surface is obtained. The numerical corrections to the observed dT/dΔ and apparent azimuth, for a number of combinations of various dip angles and velocity contrasts, are tabulated. The tables may be helpful when the first and second derivatives of the travel time data are to be analyzed. Their comparison with observation can also be useful for making inferences about the underlying crustal structure. The latter approach has been applied to the P arrivals across the Tonto Forest Seismological Observatory (TFSO) array, Arizona. On the basis of these observations, the Mohorovičić discontinuity under the observatory appears to be dipping locally as much as eight degrees in the N 70 ° ± 5 °E direction...|$|E
40|$|In {{the evening}} of 2014, June 03, two explosions {{occurred}} at the MSPO- 2 plant of Shell Moerdijk. The Cabauw infrasound array detected the infrasound generated by the blasts as two distinct signals. The distance between Shell Moerdijk and the Cabauw infrasound array is 40. 5 km. This array is unique as it measures infrasound in 3 D. The Fisher analysis is used to process the infrasound signals. The horizontal 2 D Fisher analysis veries the infrasound source to be Shell Moerdijk, and it shows an <b>azimuthal</b> <b>deviation</b> of 2. 1 caused by the influence of tropospheric crosswinds. The Shell Moerdijk explosions are used {{as a case study}} to investigate the measurement of infrasound in 3 D. The frequency of the signals detected at the tower has been observed to be lower than the frequency of the signals detected at the surface. A possible reason is that the infrasound signals propagate through small pipes before reaching the tower sensors. Consequently, a reduced coherency between the tower and ground signals exists. Due to this lack of coherency, the 3 D Fisher analysis was not able to perform correctly. The signature of the infrasound waveform with altitude is examined in detail, obtained by the vertical measurement of infrasound. It is showing up- and down-going waves in both explosion signals which can only be seen in the 3 D vertical measurements. Ray tracing confirms the existence of these different waves. In summary, this research shows the added value of measuring infrasound in 3 D. Civil Engineering and GeosciencesGeoscience & EngineeringDouble degree Applied Geophysic...|$|E

A variation in bearing with Doppler frequency was frequently evident, an effect attributed to Doppler shifts imposed on the signal when scattered from ionospheric irregularities drifting across the reflection points. For a transauroral path, for which the ionospheric reflection points were subauroral, standard deviations of up to ~ 2. 5 ° were observed in the azimuthal power distribution of the received energy. Much greater disturbances with <b>azimuthal</b> standard <b>deviations</b> of up to ~ 35 ° were recorded on signals received over a path contained entirely within the polar cap path...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the complex propagation of seismic waves beneath the Campi Flegrei caldera, Italy, using multichannel recordings of artificial explosions. The sources consisted of air gun explosions {{shot in the}} Gulf of Pozzuoli at offsets ranging {{between 3 and 7}} km. A multichannel recording device was deployed in the Solfatara crater and consisted of ten vertical-component and two three-component short-period seismometers with a maximum aperture of about 150 m. The zero-lag correlation (ZLC) technique was adopted to estimate horizontal slowness and backazimuth of coherent waves crossing the array. For sources located in the northern sector of the Gulf, with maximum offset 5 km, ray parameters and backazimuths are in agreement with those predicted for the 1 D velocity model used for routine locations. For sources at offsets larger than approximately 5 km, the ZLC curves depict prominent maxima associated with a secondary phase propagating with a lower velocity than the first-arrival P wave. Using finite-difference synthetic seismograms generated for a 2 D realistic velocity model, we explain these late arrivals in terms of a lateral velocity variation located at depths of about 1 km. Such discontinuity would correspond to a positive V (sub p) anomaly imaged by a recent 3 D tomographic study, and interpreted as the submerged southern rim of Campi Flegrei caldera collapsed during the explosive eruption of 12 ky B. P. The small spacing among adjacent shot points allowed simultaneous wave-field decomposition at the source and receiver arrays. Using {{a modified version of the}} double-beam method, we retrieve the independent variation of horizontal slowness at both the source and receiver regions. For both cases, we found <b>azimuthal</b> <b>deviations</b> as large as 50 degrees with respect to the great circle path. At the source region, these discrepancies may be interpreted in terms of ray bending at the interface of the aforementioned positive anomaly. At the receiver array, the observed anomalies may be attributed to either velocity variations marking the Solfatara crater rim, or to a near-receiver, low-velocity body whose position would coincide with negative gravimetric anomalies and a high V (sub p) /V (sub s) ratio region inferred by independent geophysical and seismological studies...|$|R
40|$|We examine deep Chandra X-ray {{observations}} of the Centaurus cluster of galaxies, Abell 3526. Applying a gradient magnitude filter reveals a wealth of structure, from filamentary soft emission on 100 pc (0. 5 arcsec) scales close to the nucleus to features 10 s of kpc in size at larger radii. The cluster contains multiple high-metallicity regions with sharp edges. Relative to an <b>azimuthal</b> average, the <b>deviations</b> of metallicity and surface brightness are correlated, and the temperature is inversely correlated, as expected if the larger scale asymmetries in the cluster are dominated by sloshing motions. Around the western cold front {{are a series of}} ~ 7 kpc 'notches', suggestive of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. The cold front width varies from 4 kpc down to close to the electron mean free path. Inside the front are multiple metallicity blobs on scales of 5 - 10 kpc, which could have been uplifted by AGN activity, also explaining the central metallicity drop and flat inner metallicity profile. Close to the nucleus are multiple shocks, including a 1. 9 -kpc-radius inner shell-like structure and a weak 1. 1 - 1. 4 Mach number shock around the central cavities. Within a 10 kpc radius are 9 depressions in surface brightness, several of which appear to be associated with radio emission. The shocks and cavities imply that the nucleus has been repeatedly active on 5 - 10 Myr timescales, indicating a tight balance between heating and cooling. We confirm the presence of a series of linear quasi-periodic structures. If they are sound waves, the ~ 5 kpc spacing implies a period of 6 Myr, similar to the ages of the shocks and cavities. Alternatively, these structures may be Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, their associated turbulence or amplified magnetic field layers. Comment: 28 pages, 32 figures, accepted by MNRA...|$|R
