25|$|The SDC {{device is}} {{operational}} immediately after fabrication. Switching {{occurs in the}} Ge2Se3 <b>active</b> <b>layer,</b> where a key feature of the device, Ge-Ge homopolar bonds, are found. The three layers consisting of Ge2Se3/Ag/Ge2Se3, directly below the top tungsten electrode, mix together during deposition and jointly form the silver-source layer. This silver-source layer is not {{in direct contact with}} the <b>active</b> <b>layer.</b> This allows the device to have significantly higher processing and operating temperatures (above 250°C and at least 150°C, respectively) since silver does not migrate into the <b>active</b> <b>layer</b> at high temperatures, and the <b>active</b> <b>layer</b> maintains a high glass transition temperature (~350°C). These processing and operating temperatures are higher than most ion-conducting chalcogenide device types, including the S-based glasses (e.g. GeS) that need to be photodoped or thermally annealed. It is a combination of these factors that allow the SDC device to operate over a wide range of temperatures, including long-term continuous operation at 150°C.|$|E
25|$|A {{laser diode}} is {{electrically}} a PIN diode. The active {{region of the}} laser diode is in the intrinsic (I) region, and the carriers (electrons and holes) are pumped into that region from the N and P regions respectively. While initial diode laser research was conducted on simple P-N diodes, all modern lasers use the double-hetero-structure implementation, where the carriers and the photons are confined {{in order to maximize}} their chances for recombination and light generation. Unlike a regular diode, the goal for a laser diode is to recombine all carriers in the I region, and produce light. Thus, laser diodes are fabricated using direct band-gap semiconductors. The laser diode epitaxial structure is grown using one of the crystal growth techniques, usually starting from an N doped substrate, and growing the I doped <b>active</b> <b>layer,</b> followed by the P doped cladding, and a contact layer. The <b>active</b> <b>layer</b> most often consists of quantum wells, which provide lower threshold current and higher efficiency.|$|E

25|$|Having unique {{features}} of tunable resonances and unprecedented near-field enhancement, plasmon is an enabling technique for light management. Recently, performances of thin-film solar cells have been pronouncedly improved by introducing metallic nanostructures. The improvements are mainly {{attributed to the}} plasmonic-optical effects for manipulating light propagation, absorption, and scattering. The plasmonic-optical effects could: (1) boost optical absorption of active materials; (2) spatially redistribute light absorption at the <b>active</b> <b>layer</b> due to the localized near-field enhancement around metallic nanostructures. Except for the plasmonic-optical effects, the effects of plasmonically modified recombination, transport and collection of photocarriers (electrons and holes), hereafter named plasmonic-electrical effects, have been proposed by Sha, etal. For boosting device performance, they conceived a general design rule, tailored to arbitrary electron to hole mobility ratio, to decide the transport paths of photocarriers. The design rule suggests that electron to hole transport length ratio should be balanced with electron to hole mobility ratio. In other words, the transport time of electrons and holes (from initial generation sites to corresponding electrodes) should be the same. The general design rule can be realized by spatially redistributing light absorption at the <b>active</b> <b>layer</b> of devices (with the plasmonic-electrical effect). They also demonstrated the breaking of space charge limit in plasmonic-electrical organic solar cell.|$|E

40|$|Polymer:fullerene bulk {{heterojunction}} (BHJ) {{solar cell}} <b>active</b> <b>layers</b> {{can be created}} by traditional blend casting (BC), where the components are mixed together in solution before deposition, or by sequential processing (SqP), where the pure polymer and fullerene materials are cast sequentially from different solutions. Presently, however, {{the relative merits of}} SqP as compared to BC are not fully understood because there has yet to be an equivalent (composition- and thickness-matched layer) comparison between the two processing techniques. The main reason why matched SqP and BC devices have not been compared is because the composition of SqP <b>active</b> <b>layers</b> has not been accurately known. In this paper, we present a novel technique for accurately measuring the polymer:fullerene film composition in SqP <b>active</b> <b>layers,</b> which allows us to make the first comparisons between rigorously composition- and thickness-matched BHJ organic solar cells made by SqP and traditional BC. We discover that, in optimal photovoltaic devices, SqP <b>active</b> <b>layers</b> have a very similar composition as their optimized BC counterparts (≈ 44 - 50 mass % PCBM). We then present a thorough investigation of the morphological and device properties of thickness- and composition-matched P 3 HT:PCBM SqP and BC <b>active</b> <b>layers</b> in order to better understand the advantages and drawbacks of both processing approaches. For our matched devices, we find that small-area SqP cells perform better than BC cells due to both superior film quality and enhanced optical absorption from more crystalline P 3 HT. The enhanced film quality of SqP <b>active</b> <b>layers</b> also results in higher performance and significantly better reproducibility in larger-area devices, indicating that SqP is more amenable to scaling than the traditional BC approach. X-ray diffraction, UV-vis absorption, and energy-filtered transmission electron tomography collectively show that annealed SqP <b>active</b> <b>layers</b> have a finer-scale blend morphology and more crystalline polymer and fullerene domains when compared to equivalently processed BC <b>active</b> <b>layers.</b> Charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage (CELIV) measurements, combined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, also show that the top (nonsubstrate) interface for SqP films is slightly richer in PCBM compared to matched BC <b>active</b> <b>layers.</b> Despite these clear differences in bulk and vertical morphology, transient photovoltage, transient photocurrent, and subgap external quantum efficiency measurements all indicate that the interfacial electronic processes occurring at P 3 HT:PCBM heterojunctions are essentially identical in matched-annealed SqP and BC <b>active</b> <b>layers,</b> suggesting that device physics are surprisingly robust with respect to the details of the BHJ morphology. © 2014 American Chemical Society...|$|R

25|$|The Central Siberian Plateau is {{an ancient}} craton (sometimes named Angaraland) that formed an {{independent}} continent before the Permian (see the Siberian continent). It is exceptionally rich in minerals, containing large deposits of gold, diamonds, and ores of manganese, lead, zinc, nickel, cobalt and molybdenum. Much of the area includes the Siberian Traps—a large igneous province. This massive eruptive period was approximately coincident with the Permian–Triassic extinction event. The volcanic event {{is said to be}} the largest known volcanic eruption in Earth's history. Only the extreme northwest was glaciated during the Quaternary, but almost all is under exceptionally deep permafrost, and the only tree that can thrive, despite the warm summers, is the deciduous Siberian Larch (Larix sibirica) with its very shallow roots. Outside the extreme northwest, the taiga is dominant, covering a significant fraction of the entirety of Siberia.

25|$|Proper {{choice of}} plasmatic metal nano-particles {{is crucial for}} the maximum light {{absorption}} in the <b>active</b> <b>layer.</b> Front surface located nano-particles Ag and Au are {{the most widely used}} materials due to their surface plasmon resonances located in the visible range and therefore interact more strongly with the peak solar intensity. However, such noble metal nano-particles always introduce reduced light coupling into Si at the short wavelengths below the surface plasmon resonance due to the detrimental Fano effect, i.e. the destructive interference between the scattered and unscattered light. Moreover, the noble metal nano-particles are impractical to implement for large-scale solar cell manufacture due to their high cost and scarcity in the earth's crust. Recently, Zhang et al. have demonstrated the low cost and earth abundant materials Al nano-particles to be able to outperform the widely used Ag and Au nano-particles. Al nano-particles, with their surface plasmon resonances located in the UV region below the desired solar spectrum edge at 300nm, can avoid the reduction and introduce extra enhancement in the shorter wavelength range.|$|E
25|$|The {{principle}} of liquid-crystal display (LCD) technology {{relies on the}} rotation of the axis of linear polarization by the liquid crystal array. Light from the backlight (or the back reflective layer, in devices not including or requiring a backlight) first passes through a linear polarizing sheet. That polarized light passes through the actual liquid crystal layer which may be organized in pixels (for a TV or computer monitor) or in another format such as a seven-segment display or one with custom symbols for a particular product. The liquid crystal layer is produced with a consistent right (or left) handed chirality, essentially consisting of tiny helices. This causes circular birefringence, and is engineered so that there is a 90 degree rotation of the linear polarization state. However, when a voltage is applied across a cell, the molecules straighten out, lessening or totally losing the circular birefringence. On the viewing side of the display is another linear polarizing sheet, usually oriented at 90 degrees from the one behind the <b>active</b> <b>layer.</b> Therefore, when the circular birefringence is removed by the application of a sufficient voltage, the polarization of the transmitted light remains at right angles to the front polarizer, and the pixel appears dark. With no voltage, however, the 90 degree rotation of the polarization causes it to exactly match the axis of the front polarizer, allowing the light through. Intermediate voltages create intermediate rotation of the polarization axis and the pixel has an intermediate intensity. Displays based on this principle are widespread, and now are used {{in the vast majority of}} televisions, computer monitors and video projectors, rendering the previous CRT technology essentially obsolete. The use of polarization in the operation of LCD displays is immediately apparent to someone wearing polarized sunglasses, often making the display unreadable.|$|E
