5|$|After the Union of England and Scotland in 1707, Scottish peers, {{including}} {{those who did not}} sit as representative peers, were excluded from the House of Commons. Irish peers were more favoured and not subjected to the same restrictions. Irish members not nominated as representative peers were allowed to serve in Parliament <b>as</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> a constituencies in Great Britain, although not in Ireland, provided they gave up their privileges as a peer. Lord Curzon, for example, specifically requested an Irish peerage so he would not be debarred from sitting in the House of Commons.|$|E

5|$|King Stephen gave {{permission}} {{for some of}} England's bishops, including Bethune, to attend the Council of Reims in 1148. Stephen had expelled the papal legates, or representatives, who arrived in England to summon the bishops to Reims, and after that appointed three of the bishops <b>as</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> the English Church. These three, Bethune, Hilary of Chichester, and William de Turbeville, were allowed to attend the council. Theobald of Bec was expressly forbidden to attend, {{but he managed to}} evade those watching him and arrived in Reims along with his clerk, Thomas Becket.|$|E
5|$|Magistrates {{were elected}} officials, serving <b>as</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> {{the people for}} the conduct of public business. There are two broad {{categories}} of magistrates, the ordinary magistrates such as the consuls, products of the republican constitution, and the extraordinary magistrates such as the dictators, remnants of the monarchial constitution and reserved primarily for emergencies. Each magistrate held potestas, the authority to exercise the office's powers conferred by custom or statute. The most powerful magistrates, such as the extraordinary magistrates, consuls, and praetors, held a kind of authority known as imperium, the authority to command in a military or judicial sense.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the Slavic peoples, who arrived on Polish lands {{at the outset of}} the Middle Ages <b>as</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> the Prague culture, go back to the Kiev culture, which formed {{beginning}} early in the 3rd century AD and is genetically derived from the Post-Zarubintsy cultural horizon (Rakhny–Ljutez–Pochep material culture sphere) and itself was one of the later post-Zarubintsy culture groups. Such an ethnogenetic relationship is apparent between the large Kiev culture population and the early (6th–7th centuries) Slavic settlements in the Oder and Vistula basins, but lacking between these Slavic settlements and the older local cultures within the same region, that ceased to exist beginning in the 400–450 AD period.|$|E

5|$|There {{is often}} a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a {{national}} league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Barcelona and Real Madrid is known as El Clásico. From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen <b>as</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> two rival regions in Spain: Catalonia and Castile, {{as well as of}} the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between Catalans and the Castilians, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of a demise of the Crown, the Privy Council—together with the Lords Spiritual, the Lords Temporal, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of the City of London as well <b>as</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> Commonwealth realms—makes a {{proclamation}} declaring the accession of the new sovereign and receives an oath from the new monarch relating to the security of the Church of Scotland, as required by law. It is also customary for the new sovereign to make an allocution to the Privy Council on that occasion, and this Sovereign's Speech is formally published in The London Gazette. Any such Special Assembly of the Privy Council, convened to proclaim the accession of a new sovereign and witness the monarch's statutory oath, is known as an Accession Council. The last such meetings were held on 6 and 8 February 1952: as Elizabeth II was abroad when the last demise of the Crown took place, the Accession Council met twice, once to proclaim the sovereign (meeting of 6 February 1952), and then again after the new queen had returned to Britain, to receive from her the oath required by statute (meeting of 8 February 1952).|$|E
5|$|John Neville soon emerged, with Warwick, <b>as</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> the king's {{power in}} the north, which was still {{politically}} turbulent, as there were still {{a large number of}} Lancastrians on the loose attempting to raise rebellion against the new regime. As his brother Warwick became more involved in national politics and central government, it devolved to John to finally defeat the last remnants of Lancastrians in 1464. Following these victories, Montagu, in what {{has been described as a}} high point for his House, was created Earl of Northumberland. At around the same time, however, his brother Warwick became increasingly dissatisfied with his relationship with the king, and began instigating rebellions against Edward IV in the north, finally capturing him in July 1469. At first, Montagu helped suppress this discontent, and also encouraged Warwick to release Edward. Eventually, however, his brother went into French exile with the king's brother George, Duke of Clarence, in March 1470.|$|E
