A novel device is described {{that can be used to}} detect radio signals from depths exceeding the detection range of <b>aerial</b> <b>antennas.</b> This device can be used in small, confined bodies of water to track seasonal move-ments of fish into deep water, to identify locations of lost or expelled transmitters, to monitor relatively im-mobile benthic species, and to determine swimming or suspended depth while retaining several other advan-tages associated with the use of radio (versus ultrasonic) transmitters.

50|$|Fred {{was a great}} amateur radio enthusiast {{with his}} call sign G2BCX, and his {{innovative}} designs for the Slim Jim and ZL Special <b>aerial</b> <b>antennas</b> are still in use today. From the late 1970s, he operated {{from his home in}} Cantley, Norfolk. Towards the end of his life, he built several detailed reconstructions of early electrical devices including a Wimshurst machine and Edison phonograph. He was honoured by the University of East Anglia for constructing a working replica of apparatus used by Heinrich Hertz, but it seems that none of this equipment, the Chromasonics apparatus or his experimental music-making machinery has survived. However, starting in 2010 all of his remaining original quarter inch tapes have been catalogued and deposited with the British Library Sound Archive.|$|R
30|$|Passive RFID tags have no {{internal}} power supply. The minute electrical current induced in the antenna by the incoming {{radio frequency signal}} provides just enough power for the integrated circuit (IC) in the tag to power up and transmit a response (Bouet and Dos Santos 2008). Most passive tags signal by backscattering the carrier signal from the reader. This means that the <b>aerial</b> (<b>antenna)</b> has to be designed to both collect power from the incoming signal and also to transmit the outbound backscatter signal. The tag chip can contain nonvolatile EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory) for storing data (Barnett and Liu 2008). Lack of an onboard power supply means that the device can be quite small: commercially available products exist that can be embedded under the skin. As of 2005, the smallest such devices commercially available measured 0.4  mm ×  0.4  mm, and is thinner than a sheet of paper; such devices are practically invisible. Passive tags have practical read distances ranging from about 2  mm up to about few metres depending on the chosen radio frequency.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{effective}} use of multiple quadrotor drones as an <b>aerial</b> <b>antenna</b> array that provides wireless service to ground users is investigated. In particular, under the goal of minimizing the airborne service time needed for communicating with ground users, a novel framework for deploying and operating a drone-based antenna array system whose elements are single-antenna drones is proposed. In the considered model, the service time is minimized by jointly optimizing the wireless transmission {{time as well as}} the control time that is needed for movement and stabilization of the drones. To minimize the transmission time, first, the antenna array gain is maximized by optimizing the drone spacing within the array. In this case, using perturbation techniques, the drone spacing optimization problem is addressed by solving successive, perturbed convex optimization problems. Then, the optimal locations of the drones around the array's center are derived such that the transmission time for the user is minimized. Given the determined optimal locations of drones, the drones must spend a control time to adjust their positions dynamically so as to serve multiple users. To minimize this control time of the quadrotor drones, the speed of rotors is optimally adjusted based on both the destinations of the drones and external forces (e. g., wind and gravity). In particular, using bang-bang control theory, the optimal rotors' speeds as well as the minimum control time are derived in closed-form. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can significantly reduce the service time to ground users compared to a multi-drone scenario in which the same number of drones are deployed separately to serve ground users. The results also show that, in comparison with the multi-drones case, the network's spectral efficiency can be significantly improved...|$|E

50|$|Electrical {{transmission}} and distribution lines for electric power always use voltages significantly higher than 50 volts, so contact with or close approach to the line conductors presents a danger of electrocution. Contact with overhead wires is a frequent cause of injury or death. Metal ladders, farm equipment, boat masts, construction machinery, <b>aerial</b> <b>antennas,</b> and similar objects are frequently involved in fatal contact with overhead wires. Digging into a buried cable can also be dangerous to workers at an excavation site. Digging equipment (either hand tools or machine driven) that contacts a buried cable may energize piping or {{the ground in the}} area, resulting in electrocution of nearby workers. A fault in a high-voltage transmission line or substation may result in high currents flowing along the surface of the earth, producing an earth potential rise that also presents a danger of electric shock.|$|R
5000|$|The payload of the TV3 {{was very}} similar to the later Vanguard 1. It was a small {{aluminium}} sphere, 15.2 cm in diameter and with a mass of 1.36 kg.

Using six small <b>aerial</b> <b>antennae</b> mounted on its body, the satellite primarily transmitted engineering and telemetry data, but the transmitters were also used to determine the total electron content between the satellite and the ground stations.

Although the satellite was damaged beyond reuse capability during the crash, it was still intact and transmitting after the incident.|$|R

30|$|If the DVB-T {{receiver}} and the WSD {{are in the}} same pixel, we have no information on their separation, so the co-pixel computation needs to be based on a reference geometry. For this study, we consider a fixed DVB-T reception and a fixed TVWS BS transmission, both with outdoor <b>aerial</b> <b>antennas</b> at 10 m in height [15], with a minimum separation distance of 20 m, following the reference geometry defined in [17]. According to a free-space path loss (FSPL) propagation model, minimum path loss for the frequency range of interest (470 to 790 MHz) is roughly − 50 dB. To account for the potential inaccuracies (or estimation errors) in the location of a WSD or DVB-T receiver within a pixel, the above minimum path loss within a pixel is specified as the minimum of those calculated for the M surrounding pixels, i.e., the 8 first-tier adjacent pixels (M = 8), as illustrated in Figure 4. This approach also accounts for the case where a WSD within a pixel is actually in the proximity of a DVB-T receiver in a neighboring pixel.|$|R

Our specific study objectives are to describe the behavior of yearling and subyearling chinook salmon and yearling steelhead in the forebay areas of John Day, The Dalles, and Bonneville dams to determine: 1) the approach of juvenile salmonids into forebay areas from locations upriver and determine if route of approach influences subsequent behavior in the forebay; 2) residence time, distribution, and route and timing of dam passage; 3) fine-scale (+ 5 m) fish behavior near and within surface collection structures.

They consist of a coil of wire wound around a ferrite rod core (usually several inches longer than the coil, but sometimes over 3 feet long). This core effectively ‘concentrates’ the magnetic field of the radio waves to give a stronger signal than could be obtained by an air core loop antenna of comparable size, although still not as strong as the signal that could be obtained with a good outdoor wire aerial.|$|R
