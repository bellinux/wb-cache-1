He told his daughter that [...] "the English <b>are</b> <b>wonderful</b> people to live with in England." [...] He welcomed white support for his cause, {{so long as it}} was generous and unconditional, and spoke of a Kenya in which indigenous Africans, Europeans, Arabs, and Indians could all regard themselves as Kenyans, working and living alongside each other peacefully. He nevertheless exhibited a general dislike of Indians, believing that they exploited indigenous Africans in Kenya.|$|E

The Arabian's lightness and responsiveness <b>are</b> <b>wonderful,</b> as is their willingness to be your partner. And...they are beautiful. Arabian horses have never let me down." [...] She valued horses with good dispositions and athletic ability as well as attractive appearance. She does not breed Arabians for a specific discipline, instead describes her breeding philosophy as “consistently continuing to breed for more quality and never losing disposition or athletic ability.” Following these principles, Varian has produced {{some of the most}} influential Arabian stallions in the breed.|$|E

In an interview with Dustin Fitzharris of Out, Wyatt explained that the song has an ambiguous meaning, [...] "It can deal with addiction. It can deal with just the basic instincts – some of them <b>are</b> <b>wonderful</b> {{and some of them}} are very dangerous." [...] In a separate interview with Joe Zadeh for Clash, Wyatt deemed it a [...] "very simple song" [...] and elaborated on its subject matter, [...] "Directing your attention to man's underlying nature and how sometimes things in society just don't work out to meet your needs. And a lot of people end up feeling very dissatisfied. And the way people feel the need to fit into certain circumstances without even thinking about what they want." [...] "Animal" [...] was recorded at Robotberget, the band's own studio in Stockholm, Sweden. The band produced the track and then mixed it with Anders Hvenare.|$|E

2500|$|In 2010, a Polish {{language}} monograph titled Kapuściński Non-Fiction {{written by}} Artur Domosławski {{was published in}} Warsaw. Kapuściński's widow, Alicja Kapuścińska, sought an injunction against Domosławski's book, claiming defamation and invasion of privacy. The injunction {{was rejected by the}} Polish court on the grounds that she had chosen to give Domosławski access to her husband's archive. In an interview with The Guardian Domosławski said: [...] "Kapuściński was experimenting in journalism. He wasn't aware he had crossed the line between journalism and literature. I still think his books <b>are</b> <b>wonderful</b> and precious. But ultimately, they belong to fiction."

2500|$|Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote favourably of {{the serial}} in The Discontinuity Guide (1995), despite some criticism, [...] "The first two episodes <b>are</b> <b>wonderful,</b> a well {{directed}} and expensive looking restating of the series' basics, {{but once the}} Cybermen are released from the Tombs, they go back in again." [...] In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker stated that the serial {{was similar to the}} previous Cybermen stories, but it [...] "manages to develop the idea to greater advantage and, as a result, achieves a considerable success" [...] and was [...] "well-paced, gripping and, in places, genuinely frightening". They praised the Cybermen, but said the noise they made while being attacked was [...] "silly", and also criticised some of the direction and Deborah Watling's Victoria, whom they felt was an inconsistent character.|$|E

[...] He played end for the undefeated 1919 Fighting Irish team that also featured another Michiganian, George Gipp. The passing combination of Gipp at left halfback to Kirk at left end became one of Notre Dame's greatest offensive weapons in 1919. [...] In October 1919, The Fort Wayne News and Sentinel praised [...] "the ability of Kirk in receiving passes and breaking away for long runs." [...] In early November 1919, Kirk drew attention {{for his work in}} Notre Dame's win over Indiana. [...] The Indianapolis Star praised the team's end play:"The Irish wing men <b>are</b> <b>wonderful</b> performers. [...] Either Kirk or Anderson can snag the ball out of the air on forward passes with great skill. [...] Both are fast and wonderful defensive men. [...] It was seldom in Saturday's game that either was boxed. [...] They broke up what little interference Indiana displayed and got through to their man time after time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Contrary to the {{opinions}} {{of some of his}} enemies, who never tire to credit Leitner's poetry with supposed incomprehensibility, other commentators – such as the Süddeutsche Zeitung – have given quite different assessments of his work. With respect to his poetry collection The Truth about Uncle Spam (German: Die Wahrheit über Uncle Spam), critics from that newspaper wrote: [...] " [...] is playfully light and aerial [...] because he does not trust in false claims to intellectual depth, his miniatures <b>are</b> <b>wonderful</b> reads." [...] While earlier in his career, he was called [...] "pessimistic," [...] critics such as [...] have recently honored him with the title of Jokester: [...] "Leitner wants to unearth the madness and idiocy that surrounds us every day, but he does so playfully, without any kind of moralistic resentment or invectives." [...] Numerous critics have remarked on Leitner's enlightened irony. In a review of Der digitale Hai ist high (German for The Digital Shark is High), Peter Kapp wrote in the Rheinische Post: [...] "by means of hearty verbal wit and twisted word play, Leitner incites a lust for poetry." [...] Leitner does not hide behind fictions of seriousness: [...] "the publisher and publicist [...] does not care very much for the widely held notion that poetry is something for quiet retreats. He thinks that poetry is part of everyday life and should be fun." [...] In his preface to Der digitale Hai ist high Günter Kunert wrote, [...] "It's rare that a poet brings together three special qualities in his personality, {{as in the case of}} Anton G. Leitner. That guy has a feeling for the language; he has a lust for the language; he's obsessed with sex—where else do these three qualities come together? Humor, wit, and common sense. This is a mixture that can rarely be found in German poetry." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lyle Masaki of AfterElton.com commends the manga for {{illustrating}} [...] "the challenges gay men face in Japanese society", and for {{not following}} the traditional mode of student-teacher romantic relationships in [...] "Boys Love" [...] titles, opting instead for a friendship where both characters discover {{more about what}} it is to be a gay man. Holly Ellingwood at Active Anime commended the first volume its unique artwork, and praised the plot for its [...] "bittersweet" [...] poignancy, and for showing unrequited love rather than being a simplistic story about [...] "winning the guy". She felt the second volume had [...] "unusual pacing" [...] and came off as [...] "abrupt" [...] peeks into the lives of many different couples. Mania.com's Danielle Van Gorder praised the manga for its characterization and ability to reflect reality. Erin Finnegan of Pop Culture Shock criticized the story for Ida and Hachizume adopting each other, essentially getting married, before having sex, which she regarded as unrealistic. Comic World News's David Welsh says that Yoshinaga's characters, even in this early work, have layers, and that it is enjoyable to see how the frank student inspires the adult characters to communicate better. Coolstreak Cartoons's Leroy Douresseaux criticizes the manga for its inability to focus on one couple. Robin Brenner described the plot as being [...] "an engaging meditation on how crushes <b>are</b> <b>wonderful,</b> but oh, how they can hurt." [...] Jason Thompson regarded the story as having been [...] "padded out", but enjoyed the theme of [...] "love and loss" [...] in the manga. [...] Johanna Draper Carlson felt it was novel for the treatment of sex in the first volume to consist of a character making sure they would be able to satisfy their partner. [...] She felt the second volume was strange for being largely sex scenes.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune {{gave the}} film {{three and a}} half stars out of four, saying, [...] "Schumer and Hader <b>are</b> <b>wonderful</b> together. Gender {{inequity}} in the world of comedy deserves all the overdue attention it's getting, and more. But there are matters of craft, wit (no matter how crude the jokes) and timing that transcend chromosomes." [...] Richard Roeper of The Chicago Sun Times praised the performances of the cast, particularly Schumer, Hader, Quinn, and James. He also called Schumer's performance worthy of an Academy Award nomination. [...] Benjamin Lee of The Guardian gave the film three out of five stars, stating, [...] "Judd Apatow's latest is rough around the edges, but his focus on a female protagonist refreshes a genre in sore need of change". Ian Crouch, writing for The New Yorker, singled out LeBron James' performance for praise, writing that [...] "it seems safe to declare that he has given the greatest motion-picture acting performance by an active professional basketball player of all time." [...] Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B+, saying, [...] "Beneath all of his bad-boy shtick, Apatow's always been a pretty conventional moralist. But Schumer gives their raunchy rom-com enough of her signature spikiness to prevent it from ever feeling predictable." [...] Jacob Hall of the New York Daily News gave the film four out of five stars, saying, [...] "Schumer raises Apatow's game beautifully. Her biting, pitch-black wit and his penchant for character-driven comedy go together like gin and tonic." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, saying [...] "Sweet is not how Schumer wants Trainwreck to go down. She wants to explode rom-com clichés and replace them with something fierce and ready to rumble. Done." ...|$|E

2500|$|The staged {{premiere of}} Donnerstag {{was very well}} {{received}} in Italy, where it was awarded the Italian Music Critics' Prize for best new work in December 1981. The German press reception, on the other hand, was harsh and often ad hominem [...] The Covent Garden production in 1985 also provoked contrary points of view in the press, in part divided over {{the question of the}} music versus the theatrical conception. Paul Griffiths, writing in the Times, for example, found that [...] "it contains much quite extraordinary music" [...] but [...] "the opera never for a moment works as the mystic revelation it pretends to be. … It is very wondrous to contemplate—wondrous, that is, when it is not just silly" [...] Andrew Porter, on the contrary, found the [...] "variety of forces, forms, textures, and matter … a strength and a pleasure", and the [...] "somewhat ramshackle construction saves the work from solemn pretentiousness. There's even a playful quality about much of it, although its essential seriousness is not in doubt and inner musical integrity is not compromised" [...] Porter concludes, hearing and seeing the drama is an engrossing, enjoyable, and elevating adventure. Ear, mind, and spirit are engaged. And, as I suggested, moments of jokiness, naïveté—silliness, even—save the work from being unbearably solemn: Stockhausen-Sarastro has a vein of Papageno in him. There is a great deal to listen to and to watch. Some of the spans, especially in the last scene, are traversed slowly. But things happen; the music doesn't fall into simplistic repetitions or numbing stasis. There are counterpoints to follow. There are supple melodies and rich harmonies. There <b>are</b> <b>wonderful</b> sounds—new and stirring sounds. The score is a culmination of the marvellous musics—in whose making Michael's vision, Lucifer's technical skills, and the inspiration of Eve's love seem to have conspired—that have poured from Stockhausen during the last thirty years. … But what matters most now is the excitement of entering this huge, ambitious work, responding to its sounds and sights, trying to understand it, and feeling, perhaps, that it is—by intention at least—something like a Divine Comedy and a Comédie Humaine in one.|$|E
