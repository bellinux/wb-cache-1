40|$|BACKGROUND: Non-invasive {{positive}} pressure ventilation (NIPPV), using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel ventilation, {{has been}} shown to reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with <b>acute</b> cardiogenic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>oedema.</b> We assessed additional benefits of NIPPV in a meta-analysis. METHODS: Meta-analysis comparison in <b>acute</b> cardiogenic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>oedema</b> was undertaken to compare (1) CPAP with standard therapy (oxygen by face-mask, diuretics, nitrates, and other supportive care), (2) bilevel ventilation with standard therapy, and (3) bilevel ventilation with CPAP, incorporating randomised controlled trials identified by electronic and hand search (1966 -May, 2005). In 23 trials that fulfilled inclusion criteria, we assessed the effect of NIPPV on hospital mortality and mechanical ventilation, estimated as relative risks. FINDINGS: CPAP was associated with a significantly lower mortality rate than standard therapy (relative risk 0. 59, 95 % CI 0. 38 - 0. 90, p= 0. 015). A non-significant trend towards reduced mortality was seen in the comparison between bilevel ventilation and standard therapy (0. 63, 0. 37 - 1. 10, p= 0. 11). We recorded no substantial difference in mortality risk between bilevel ventilation and CPAP (p= 0. 38). The need for mechanical ventilation was reduced with CPAP (0. 44, 0. 29 - 0. 66, p= 0. 0003) and with bilevel ventilation (0. 50, 0. 27 - 0. 90, p= 0. 02), compared with standard therapy; but no significant difference was seen between CPAP and bilevel ventilation (p= 0. 86). Weak evidence of an increase in the incidence of new myocardial infarction with bilevel ventilation versus CPAP was recorded (1. 49, 0. 92 - 2. 42, p= 0. 11). Heterogeneity of treatment effects was not evident for mortality or mechanical ventilation across patients' groups. INTERPRETATION: In patients with <b>acute</b> cardiogenic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>oedema,</b> CPAP and bilevel ventilation reduces the need for subsequent mechanical ventilation.

40|$|ABSTRACT – Non-invasive {{ventilation}} (NIV) {{has become}} the standard of care for most patients with ventilatory failure due to an acute exacerbation of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). In all but a small minority, even of the very sickest, there is little to be lost by at least a short trial of NIV. In patients with <b>acute</b> cardiogenic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>oedema,</b> NIV results in a more rapid physiological improvement and resolu-tion of dyspnoea, but the benefits in terms of survival have been called into question by two recent randomised controlled trials. There are no randomised controlled trials of NIV in patients with acute ventilatory failure due to obesity but the outcome from invasive ventilation is poor and the results of NIV encouraging. Finally, NIV may have a role during the transition from active care, aimed to extend life, to palliative care.

40|$|Acute or {{subacute}} chemical-induced lung {{injury is}} rarely compound specific and {{is most often}} caused by an accidental occupational, domestic or environmental exposure to an inhaled chemical agent. The industrial disaster that happened in Bhopal in 1984, accidental poisoning with chlorine and petroleum hydrocarbons and also vesicant gases used during conflicts, are specific examples. Rarely, a chemical agent can cause lung damage by being ingested and reaching the lung through the systemic circulation (for example accidental or deliberate paraquat ingestion). Household accidents should not be underestimated. An important cause of household accidents is chlorine inhalation resulting from mixing bleach with acids such as the scale removers used to clean toilets. Chemical agents can provoke direct and/or indirect damage to the respiratory tract. The acute or subacute clinical manifestations resulting from inhalation of chemical agents are very varied and include inhalation fevers, <b>acute</b> non-cardiogenic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>oedema,</b> adult respiratory distress syndrome, reactive airways dysfunction syndrome and acute or subacute pneumonitis.

40|$|Abstract 200 words Acute lung injury (ALI) {{and acute}} {{respiratory}} distress syndrome (ARDS) comprise a spectrum of <b>acute</b> inflammatory <b>pulmonary</b> <b>oedema</b> resulting in refractory hypoxaemia {{in the absence of}} an underlying cardiogenic cause. There are multiple pulmonary and extra-pulmonary causes and ALI/ARDS patients are a clinically heterogeneous group with associated high morbidity and mortality. Inflammatory injury to the alveolar epithelial and endothelial capillary membrane is a central event in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS, and involves degradation of the basement membrane. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been implicated in a wide variety of pulmonary pathologies and are capable of degrading all components of the extracellular matrix including the basement membrane and key non-matrix mediators of lung injury such as chemokines and cell surface receptors. While many studies implicate MMPs in the injurious process there are significant gaps in our knowledge of the role of specific proteases at different phases of injury and repair. This article examines the role of MMPs in injury and repair of the alveolar epithelial-endothelial capillary barrier and discusses the potential for MMP modulation in the prevention and treatment of ALI. The need for further mechanistic and in vivo studies to inform appropriate subsequent clinical trials of MMP modulation will be highlighted. ...|$|R
40|$|Noninvasive {{positive}} pressure ventilation in {{the acute}} care setting: where are we? N. Ambrosino*, # and G. Vagheggini# ABSTRACT: Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) {{is a technique}} used to deliver mechanical ventilation that is increasingly utilised in acute and chronic conditions. The present review examines the evidence supporting the use of NPPV in acute respiratory failure (ARF) due to different conditions. Strong evidence supports the use of NPPV for ARF to prevent endotracheal intubation (ETI), {{as well as to}} facilitate extubation in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and to avoid ETI in <b>acute</b> cardiogenic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>oedema,</b> and in immunocompromised patients. Weaker evidence supports the use of NPPV for patients with ARF due to asthma exacerbations, with post-operative or post-extubation ARF, pneumonia, acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or during bronchoscopy. NPPV should be applied under close clinical and physiological monitoring for signs of treatment failure and, in such cases, ETI should be promptly available. A trained team, careful patient selection and optimal choice of devices can optimise outcome of NPPV. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is increasingly being used in the management of acute respiratory failure but caregivers must respect evidence-supported indications and avoid contraidincations. Additionally, the technique must be applied in the appropriate location by a trained team in order to avoid disappointing results...|$|R
