25|$|At {{the start}} of their {{marriage}} Davis was the primary income provider for their family, as Clarke worked to establish himself in his law career. She accomplished this through her writing and as an editor for the New York Tribune. However, ten years after their marriage Davis had faded substantially from the literary world. Clarke gave up law and became an editor for The Philadelphia Inquirer as well. As Clarke's success grew, Davis's work became more closely linked to that of <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> housewife. In 1892, Davis received a small critical and popular success with Silhouettes of American Life {{but it was her}} last. She died at age 79, on September 29, 1910.|$|E
25|$|Hugo Gressmann {{has found}} 22 similar stories in world {{folklore}} and literature, especially in India {{and the far}} east. One Indian version is a Jataka story dealing with Buddha {{in one of his}} previous incarnations as the sage Mahosadha, who arbitrates between <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> Yakshini who is {{in the shape of a}} woman, who kidnapped the mother's baby and claimed he was hers. The sage announced a tug war: He drew a line on the ground and asked the two to stand on opposite sides of the line, one holding his feet and the other his hands – The one who would pull the baby's whole body beyond the line would get him. The mother, seeing how the baby suffers, released him and let the Yakshini take him, weeping. When the sage saw that, he turned the baby back to the hands of the true mother, exposed the identity of the Yakshini and expelled her. In other Indian versions the two women are widows of one husband. Another version appears in the Chinese drama The Chalk Circle (in this version the judge draws a circle on the ground), which has been widespread all over the world and many versions and reworkings were made after it, among them The Caucasian Chalk Circle, a play by Bertolt Brecht.|$|E

500|$|Mr. Bean's girlfriend, Irma Gobb (played by Matilda Ziegler), {{appears in}} three episodes. In [...] "The Curse of Mr. Bean" [...] and [...] "Mr. Bean Goes to Town", the {{character}} is simply credited as [...] "the girlfriend". She is treated relatively inconsiderately by Bean, who appears to regard her more as a friend and companion than as a love interest. However, he does become jealous when she dances with another man at a disco in [...] "Mr. Bean Goes to Town", and she certainly expects him to propose to her on Christmas Day in [...] "Merry Christmas, Mr. Bean"; with his {{failure to do so}} resulting in her leaving him for good. The character does not appear in any subsequent episodes; however, she later appears in the animated series. The spin-off book Mr. Bean's Diary (1993) states that Mr. Bean met Irma Gobb at a local library. Ziegler has also played a waitress, <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> policewoman.|$|E
500|$|Chopra found Mary Kom a {{very special}} and {{personal}} film due to the inspiring theme. She revealed that she channelled the grief of father's death into the film: [...] "I started this film at the hardest point in my life, four days after my father passed away. All my grief, everything, I have shoved into this movie. A part of my soul has gone into it." [...] In an interview with Daily News and Analysis, Chopra revealed that since she could not look like her, she {{did not try to}} imitate Kom as her main focus was to represent Kom's spirit and personality. In July 2013, Chopra visited Kom's home town of Manipur to learn more about her life. As part of her research, Chopra stayed with Kom and her family for three to four days, and went to her boxing academy and church to learn more about her. Kom stated, [...] "When she came to Manipur, she knew about boxing so I gave her tips as <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> wife, how I went about managing my home and profession, how I live with my family– basically she got to know aspects of my family life." ...|$|E

500|$|Clair {{has since}} been {{established}} as a feminist icon. Vox's Lauren Williams credits the character with teaching [...] "me about feminism before I knew what it was". Writing for Jezebel, Hilary Crosley Coker crowned Clair [...] "a Trojan Horse for" [...] both feminism and black feminism. Dubbing the character [...] "a bonafide feminist warrior", Daily Life Ruby Hamad praised Clair for teaching her [...] "that a woman is no less of a woman, <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> wife for working." [...] Slate critic Jason Bailey observed that, during The Cosby Shows initial run, critics and audiences were too busy commenting on {{the race of the}} sitcom's main characters to notice that Cosby had imbued his series with [...] "proud and vocal feminism" [...] in the form of Clair. According to Bailey, The Cosby Show was not only successful because Clair [...] "was a strong, liberated woman with a career"; she also [...] "had a husband and family who supported and valued her endeavors." [...] Dubbing Clair's influence on pop culture as [...] "one of TV’s great feminists" [...] the [...] "Other Huxtable Effect", Bailey concluded that the character's impact remains indisputable despite Cosby's recent sexual assault allegations, and thus maintains that The Cosby Shows legacy as a feminist series should not be discredited.|$|E
