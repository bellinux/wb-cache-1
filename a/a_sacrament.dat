5|$|In Reformed theology, baptism is <b>a</b> <b>sacrament</b> {{signifying}} the baptized person's {{union with}} Christ, or {{becoming part of}} Christ and being treated {{as if they had}} done everything Christ had. Sacraments, along with preaching of God's word, are means of grace through which God offers Christ to people. Sacraments are believed to have their effect through the Holy Spirit, but these effects are only believed to be beneficial to those who have faith in Christ.|$|E
5|$|In Reformed theology, the Lord's Supper or Eucharist is <b>a</b> <b>sacrament</b> that spiritually nourishes Christians and {{strengthens}} {{their union}} with Christ. The outward or physical {{action of the}} sacrament is eating bread and drinking wine. Reformed confessions, which are official statements of the beliefs of Reformed churches, teach that Christ's body and blood are really present in the sacrament, but that this presence is communicated in a spiritual manner rather than by his body being physically eaten. The Reformed doctrine of real presence is sometimes called mystical real presence or spiritual real presence.|$|E
5|$|Christian baptismal {{theology}} {{prior to}} the Reformation taught that sacraments, including baptism, are means or instruments through which God communicates grace to people. The sacrament was considered valid regardless of who administered it. Not everyone who received <b>a</b> <b>sacrament,</b> however, received the grace signified by the sacrament. Some medieval theologians spoke of an obstacle of mortal sin which blocks the grace of the sacrament, while others insisted that the recipient be positively open and responding in faith to the sacrament {{in order to receive}} any benefit. Baptism was believed to be used by the Holy Spirit to transform the believer, and offered the benefits of remission of sins, regeneration, and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. The sacrament of penance was believed to be necessary for forgiveness for sins committed after baptism.|$|E

5|$|Sexuality {{played an}} {{important}} role in Crowley's ideas about magick and his practice of it, and has been described as being central to Thelema. He outlined three forms of sex magick—the autoerotic, homosexual, and heterosexual—and argued that such acts could be used to focus the magician's will onto a specific goal such as financial gain or personal creative success. For Crowley, sex was treated as <b>a</b> <b>sacrament,</b> with the consumption of sexual fluids interpreted as a Eucharist. This was often manifested as the Cakes of Light, a biscuit containing either menstrual blood or a mixture of semen and vaginal fluids. The Gnostic Mass is the central religious ceremony within Thelema.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church {{teaches that}} {{marriage}} is a social and spiritual bond {{between a man and}} a woman, ordered towards the good of the spouses and procreation of children; according to Catholic teachings on sexual morality, it is the only appropriate context for sexual activity. A Catholic marriage, or any marriage between baptised individuals of any Christian denomination, is viewed as <b>a</b> <b>sacrament.</b> A sacramental marriage, once consummated, cannot be dissolved except by death. The Church recognises certain conditions, such as freedom of consent, as required for any marriage to be valid; In addition, the Church sets specific rules and norms, known as canonical form, that Catholics must follow.|$|E
5|$|The {{narrative}} {{elements of}} the ceiling illustrate that God made the World as a perfect creation and put humanity into it, that humanity fell into disgrace and was punished by death and by separation from God. Humanity then sank further into sin and disgrace, and was punished by the Great Flood. Through a lineage of Ancestors – from Abraham to Joseph – God sent the saviour of humanity, Christ Jesus. The coming of the Saviour was prophesied by Prophets of Israel and Sibyls of the Classical world. The various components of the ceiling are linked to this Christian doctrine. Traditionally, the Old Testament was perceived as a prefiguring of the New Testament. Many incidents and characters of the Old Testament were commonly understood as having a direct symbolic link to some particular aspect {{of the life of}} Jesus or to an important element of Christian doctrine or to <b>a</b> <b>sacrament</b> such as Baptism or the Eucharist. Jonah, for example, was readily recognisable by his attribute of the large fish and was commonly seen to symbolise Jesus' death and resurrection.|$|E

50|$|The Church {{teaches that}} the effect of the sacraments comes ex opere operato, by the very fact of being administered, {{regardless}} of the personal holiness of the minister administering it. However, as indicated in this definition of the sacraments given by the Catechism of the Catholic Church, a recipient's own lack of proper disposition to receive the grace conveyed can block <b>a</b> <b>sacrament's</b> effectiveness in that person. The sacraments presuppose faith and through their words and ritual elements, nourish, strengthen and give expression to faith.|$|R

25|$|The Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Coptic and Old Catholic Churches {{consider}} this anointing to be <b>a</b> <b>sacrament.</b> Other Christians too, in particular Anglicans, Lutherans and some Protestant and other Christian communities use {{a rite of}} anointing the sick, without necessarily classifying it as <b>a</b> <b>sacrament.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Christian {{belief and}} practice, <b>a</b> <b>sacrament</b> is a rite, instituted by Christ, that mediates grace, constituting a sacred mystery. The term {{is derived from}} the Latin word sacramentum, which was used to {{translate}} the Greek word for mystery. Views concerning both what rites are sacramental, and what it means for an act to be <b>a</b> <b>sacrament</b> vary among Christian denominations and traditions.|$|E
25|$|The Holy Leaven is <b>a</b> <b>sacrament</b> in the Assyrian Church of the East and {{no other}} Church recognizes it as <b>a</b> <b>sacrament.</b> With the Holy Leaven and the sacrament of the Sign of the cross, also unique to the Assyrian Church, its number of sacraments total seven. Canon law of the Church says that Holy Leaven must be added to sacramental bread {{for it to be}} consecrated. An Eucharist without the Holy Leaven is invalid.|$|E

2500|$|Baptism (from the Greek noun βάπτισμα baptisma; see below) is <b>a</b> Christian <b>sacrament</b> of {{admission}} and adoption, almost invariably {{with the use}} of water, into the Christian Church generally. The canonical Gospels report that Jesus was baptized—a historical event to which a high degree of certainty can be assigned. Baptism has been called <b>a</b> holy <b>sacrament</b> and <b>an</b> ordinance of Jesus Christ. In some denominations, baptism is also called christening, but for others the word [...] "christening" [...] is reserved for the baptism of infants. Baptism has also given its name to the Baptist churches and denominations.|$|R

25|$|The synod {{teaches that}} the Word of God, both written and preached, and the Sacraments are means of grace {{through which the}} Holy Spirit gives the gift of God's grace, creates faith {{in the hearts of}} individuals, forgives sins for the sake of Christ's death on the cross, and grants eternal life and salvation. Many Missouri Synod Lutherans define <b>a</b> <b>sacrament</b> as an action instituted by Jesus that {{combines}} a promise in God's Word with a physical element, although the synod holds no official definition for sacrament. This means that some may disagree on the number of sacraments. All agree that Baptism and Communion are sacraments. Confession and absolution is called <b>a</b> <b>sacrament</b> in the Apology of the Augsburg Confession and so is also considered by many Lutherans to be <b>a</b> <b>sacrament,</b> because it was instituted by Christ and has His promise of grace, even though it is not tied to a physical element.|$|E
25|$|For example, Church {{teaching}} {{heavily influenced}} the legal concept of marriage. During the Gregorian Reform, the Church developed and codified {{a view of}} marriage as <b>a</b> <b>sacrament.</b> In a departure from societal norms, Church law required the consent of both parties before a marriage could be performed and established a minimum age for marriage. The elevation of marriage to <b>a</b> <b>sacrament</b> also made the union a binding contract, with dissolutions overseen by Church authorities. Although the Church abandoned tradition to allow women {{the same rights as}} men to dissolve a marriage, in practice, when an accusation of infidelity was made, men were granted dissolutions more frequently than women.|$|E

25|$|The Catholic Church {{sees the}} effects of the <b>sacrament</b> as follows. <b>As</b> the <b>sacrament</b> of Marriage gives grace for the married state, the sacrament of Anointing of the Sick gives grace for the state into which people enter through sickness.
