25|$|Modified {{digital cameras}} can detect some ultraviolet, {{all of the}} visible {{and much of the}} near {{infrared}} spectrum, as most digital imaging sensors are sensitive from about 350nm to 1000nm. An off-the-shelf digital camera contains an infrared hot mirror filter that blocks most of the infrared <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> the ultraviolet that would otherwise be detected by the sensor, narrowing the accepted range from about 400nm to 700nm.|$|E

Though Lincoln had no military experience when he assumed command of his company, he is generally characterized as an able and competent leader.|$|E
25|$|During French {{exploration}} of the region in 1620, the region's inhabitants were an Iroquoian-speaking tribal offshoot of the large Neutral Nation called the Wenro people or 'Wenrohronon', who lived along the south shore of Lake Ontario and east end of Lake Erie <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> its southern shore. Later, during the 1640s–50s Beaver Wars, the combined warriors of the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy conquered the populous Neutrals and their peninsular territory, while the Senecas alone took out the Wenro and their territory, c. 1651–1653.|$|E
25|$|The Jesuits {{arrived in}} the Viceroyalty of Peru by 1571; it was a key area of Spanish empire, with not only dense {{indigenous}} populations but also huge deposits of silver at Potosí. A major figure in {{the first wave of}} Jesuits was José de Acosta (1540–1600), whose book Historia natural y moral de las Indias (1590) introduced Europeans to Spain's American empire via fluid prose and keen observation and explanation, based on fifteen years in Peru <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> time in New Spain (Mexico). Viceroy of Peru Don Francisco de Toledo urged the Jesuits to evangelize the indigenous peoples of Peru, wanting to put them in charge of parishes, but Acosta adhered to the Jesuit position that they were not subject to the jurisdiction of bishops and to catechize in Indian parishes would bring them into conflict with the bishops. For that reason, the Jesuits in Peru focused on education of elite men rather than the indigenous populations.|$|E

25|$|In 1825, he {{left for}} his second Canadian and third Arctic expedition. The goal this time was {{the mouth of the}} Mackenzie River from which he would follow the coast westward and {{possibly}} meet Frederick William Beechey who would try to sail northeast from the Bering Strait. With him was John Richardson who would follow the coast east from the Mackenzie to the mouth of the Coppermine River. At the same time, William Edward Parry would try to sail west from the Atlantic. (Beechey reached Point Barrow and Parry became frozen in 900 miles east. At this time, the only known points on the north coast were a hundred or so miles east from the Bering Strait, the mouth of the Mackenzie, Franklin's stretch east of the Coppermine, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> the Gulf of Boothia which had been seen briefly from land.) Supplies were better organized this time, in part because they were managed by Peter Warren Dease of the Hudson's Bay Company.|$|E
25|$|The Scottish Saltires gave Derbyshire Phantoms a {{good fight}} at The Grange, but despite three wickets from Ryan Watson and an unbeaten 71 from Fraser Watts Derbyshire still came out on top. Scotland had been put in to bat by Derbyshire captain Luke Sutton, and crashed to 42 for 4 after two wickets from new-ball bowler Graeme Welch, but Watts paired up well with the lower middle order before rain set in. Seven overs were cut off the Scottish innings, leaving them with 38 overs to play, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> hard hitting from Pakistani all-rounder Yasir Arafat lifted them to 179 for 7. More rain cut Derbyshire's chase to 32 overs, and under the Duckworth-Lewis method they were set 161 to win. They looked to be {{cruising}} at 120 for 2 after Steve Stubbings had put on 70 with Sutton. Watson then got three wickets and Cedric English two, as the visitors collapsed to 147 for 7, but Stubbings, still at the crease, held his head calm and ended on 75 not out to guide Derbyshire past the target with three balls to spare.|$|E

500|$|As such, {{executive}} producer and writer Russell T Davies {{had to come}} up with a story that had a good reason to keep the Doctor and Rose out. Davies was inspired by the Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode [...] "The Zeppo" [...] and the [...] episode [...] "Lower Decks", both of which focused on atypical characters. Davies described the episode, [...] "It's an experimental script. Not so experimental that people will run away screaming from Saturday-night BBC1, because you can experiment too much. People still want a bit of a monster <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a thrill <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> the Doctor, so it still delivers as normal Doctor Who. But just as you think you know everything this programme can do, this puts a little bit of spin on it." [...] The episode had the working title of [...] "I Love the Doctor". The acronym [...] "LINDA" [...] was previously used on the British children's television programme Why Don't You?, which featured the [...] "Liverpool Investigation 'N' Detective Agency". Russell T Davies worked on the series for some years.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{attracted}} {{some criticism}} from viewers who complained that Amy's character and occupation as a kissogram was [...] "too sexy" [...] {{for a family}} programme. Gillan defended her character, claiming that girls Amy's age often wore short skirts and it showed the character had confidence, while executive producer Piers Wenger said, [...] "The whole kissogram thing played into Steven's desire for the companion to be feisty and outspoken <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a number. Amy is probably the wildest companion that the Doctor has travelled with, but she isn't promiscuous".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN {{gave it a}} 6.5/10, saying that the [...] "episode felt very formulaic <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a wasted opportunity" [...] Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club gave it a B, saying, [...] "it's weird to see a Family Guy episode that has something approaching an actual story [...] and even the cutaway gags were more muted than usual." [...] In a subsequent review of Family Guys eighth season, Ramsey Isler of IGN listed [...] "Brian's Got a Brand New Bag" [...] as [...] "remarkably unfunny, with lazy and unoriginal writing." ...|$|E
500|$|Bradley Stern of MuuMuse {{said the}} song is [...] "all sorts of throwback '80's-R ferociousness, {{blending}} dirty-minded temptation with a seriously fierce strut a la Janet Jackson and Paula Abdul— <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> Divinyls' 'I Touch Myself'." [...] In his album review, he described the song as [...] "a purely Prince/Vanity 6-inspired production, seductively sauntering into the speakers across a nasty, smutty slap of a beat". Stern considered the track one of the album's best moments and wrote, [...] "there's no part of 'Sexxx Dreams' that isn't purely aural sex".

500|$|Lubezki {{compared}} the cinematic similarities to Sleepy Hollow, notably the monochromatic look of both films. He also chose a specific color palette backdrop for A Series of Unfortunate Events. [...] "The story is very episodic, so we picked {{a different color}} scheme for each section. For example", Lubezki continued, [...] "Count Olaf's house {{has a lot of}} greens, blacks and grays; the house of Uncle Monty has a lot of greens and browns <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> yellow; and the house of Aunt Josephine has blues and blacks." [...] The railroad crossing set was constructed on a cyclorama, which was the most ambitious setpiece for the art department on using elements of [...] "in house" [...] special effects and matte paintings.|$|E
500|$|The Harrier II Plus is {{very similar}} to the Night Attack variant, with the {{addition}} of an APG-65 multi-mode pulse-Doppler radar in an extended nose, allowing it to launch advanced beyond-visual-range missiles such as the AIM-120 AMRAAM. To make additional space for the radar, the angle-rate bombing system was removed. The radars used were taken from early F/A-18 aircraft, which had been upgraded with the related APG-73. In addition to the AIM-120, the AV-8B Plus can also carry AGM-65 Maverick and AGM-84 Harpoon missiles. According to aviation author Lon Nordeen, the changes [...] "had a slight increase in drag <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> additional weight, but there really was not much difference in performance between the [...] Night Attack and radar Harrier II Plus aircraft".|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{praised the}} episode, {{saying that it}} proves the show will still be good {{following}} the [...] "Michael Scott Paper Company" [...] arc, which he referred to {{as one of the}} best storylines in the show's history. Sepinwall said he thought all the supporting characters were excellent, and that he particularly liked the new adversarial dynamic between Michael and Dwight. Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly said, [...] "This was the episode I've been waiting for weeks." [...] She said she particularly enjoyed many of the subplots involving Kelly's clothing, Creed's chess game with Jim and Toby dealing with casual Friday problems. Nathan Rabin of The A.V.
