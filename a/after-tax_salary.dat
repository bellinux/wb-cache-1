50|$|Giving What We Can {{was founded}} as a giving society in 2009 by Toby Ord, an ethics {{researcher}} at Oxford University, his wife Bernadette Young, a physician in {{training at the}} time, and fellow philosopher William MacAskill {{with the goal of}} encouraging people to give 10% of their income on a regular basis to alleviate world poverty. This is similar to zakat or tithing but Ord said there was no religious motivation behind it. Ord cited writings from Peter Singer and Thomas Pogge about one's moral duty to give to the poor as inspiration for starting the organization, and personally planned to give away everything above about $28,000 a year, the median <b>after-tax</b> <b>salary</b> in the U.K. His focus was on effective giving, meaning that he emphasized donations to charities which saved a maximal amount of life per donation amount.GWWC was launched with 23 members. People who joined signed a pledge to give away 10% of their income to any organization they thought could best address poverty in the developing world, and could pledge more; there was no penalty for quitting.

By 2012 the group had 264 people from 17 countries, and it surpassed 1,000 members in 2015.|$|E

One of the measures publicly discussed is a general upper boundary to top management compensation packages ("salary cap", "maximum wage"). While such measures are novelties to the corporate world, the North American major sports leagues have been using maximum compensation regulations for decades. This paper exploits the 23 -year experience with salary cap regulations from the National Football League (NFL). The results show a significant negative relation between the success of NFL teams and the amount of the net (<b>after-tax)</b> <b>salary</b> cap represented by the personal income tax rate of the teams' home states. A team from California (highest average tax rate) wins 2. 256 games less per year and has an 11...|$|E
