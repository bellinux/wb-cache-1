5|$|Convective rain, or showery precipitation, occurs from {{convective}} clouds (e.g., cumulonimbus or cumulus congestus). It falls as showers with {{rapidly changing}} intensity. Convective precipitation falls over a certain area for <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>short</b> <b>time,</b> as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent. Most precipitation {{in the tropics}} appears to be convective; however, {{it has been suggested}} that stratiform precipitation also occurs. Graupel and hail indicate convection. In mid-latitudes, convective precipitation is intermittent and often associated with baroclinic boundaries such as cold fronts, squall lines, and warm fronts.|$|E
5|$|The first Devonian {{tetrapod}} identified from Asia {{was recognized}} from a fossil jawbone reported in 2002. The Chinese tetrapod Sinostega pani was discovered among fossilized tropical plants and lobe-finned {{fish in the}} red sandstone sediments of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region of northwest China. This finding substantially extended the geographical range of these animals and has raised new questions about the worldwide distribution and great taxonomic diversity they achieved within <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>short</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

Official estimates claimed about 18,000 casualties (including almost 5,000 dead). Some other estimates give the Polish casualties as up to 25,000.

40|$|The {{results of}} this study suggest that AR {{deficiency}} protects against autoimmune- and endotoxin-induced uveitis in mice. Thus, inhibition of this enzyme could be a novel approach for the therapeutic interventions of ocular inflammatory complications such as uveitis.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the energy {{utilization}} of rotary hearth furnace (RHF), some methods were raised to solve the problem.
