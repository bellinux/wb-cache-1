5|$|Brodie {{scored the}} only goal in a 1–0 away victory over Rushden. Mansfield agreed to extend Graham's loan until January 2010, {{when he would}} sign for the club permanently. Goals from Carruthers and Brodie gave York a 2–1 home win over Wrexham, <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>that</b> equalled the club record for {{successive}} victories in all competitions with eight. Youth-team defender Dean Lisles was promoted to the first-team squad, to provide cover for the injured Sangaré, O'Hare and Purkiss. York drew 0–0 away to Hinckley United {{in the first round}} of the FA Trophy, and the replay at home was won 3–1, in which Brodie scored his second hat-trick of 2009–10. York beat fellow play-off contenders Mansfield 3–0 on Boxing Day, Brodie (2) and Gash scoring. Berry was released after failing to make an appearance, while Emmerson was loaned out to Ossett Town of the Northern Premier League Premier Division.|$|E

5|$|By contrast, the 2013–14 {{season was}} plagued by injuries, {{suspensions}} and a high turnover of players, and the Panthers fell to fourth in the final league table. They once again reached the Challenge Cup final, but were considered outsiders against a Belfast Giants team that comfortably won the league championship and finished 32 points ahead of Nottingham. The Panthers lost the first leg 5–2, <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>that</b> left the Giants as strong favourites to lift the cup. However, the Panthers won the second leg 4–1 to level the tie and force overtime. When that finished goalless, goaltender Craig Kowalski saved all three Belfast penalty shots and Petr Kalus scored to give Panthers a 7–6 aggregate victory and a fifth consecutive Challenge Cup.|$|E
5|$|Fletcher {{scored a}} 90th-minute winner for York away to Fleetwood in a 2–1 win, <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>that</b> ended Fleetwood's five-match unbeaten run. York then drew 0–0 {{at home to}} fellow midtable team Cheltenham, before beating Plymouth 4–0 away with goals from Fletcher, McCombe (2) and Carson as the team {{achieved}} successive away wins {{for the first time}} in 2013–14. York went without scoring for a fourth consecutive home match after drawing 0–0 with Southend. Having worn the armband since an injury to McGurk, Penn was appointed captain for the rest of the season, a position that had earlier been held by Smith and Parslow.|$|E
5|$|He {{was handed}} a two-match {{suspension}} after receiving his 10th yellow card {{of the season}} during a 1–0 home victory over Newport County in an FA Trophy second round replay on 26 January 2010. He returned in a 1–0 away win over Kettering on 6 February 2010, before being handed a three-match suspension {{as a result of}} being sent off during a 1–0 away defeat to Ebbsfleet a week later after his elbow caught Dean Pooley. This resulted in a head wound that required three stitches for Pooley, and York's directors and manager apologised to Ebbsfleet manager Liam Daish for the tackle. Following Chester's expulsion from the Football Conference in March 2010, the three goals Brodie scored against them were discounted as their results were expunged. He scored {{for the first time in}} 12 matches with two goals in a 4–0 victory away to Grays on 30 March 2010.

5|$|In 2002 Switzerland {{became a}} full {{member of the}} United Nations, leaving the Vatican City as the last widely {{recognised}} state without full UN membership. Switzerland is {{a founding member of}} the EFTA, but is not a member of the European Economic Area. An application for membership in the European Union was sent in May 1992, but not advanced since the EEA was rejected in December 1992 when Switzerland was the only country to launch a referendum on the EEA. There have since been several referendums on the EU issue; due to a mixed reaction from the population the membership application has been frozen. Nonetheless, Swiss law is gradually being adjusted to conform with that of the EU, and the government has signed a number of bilateral agreements with the European Union. Switzerland, together with Liechtenstein, has been completely surrounded by the EU since Austria's entry in 1995. On 5 June 2005, Swiss voters agreed by a 55% majority to join the Schengen treaty, <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>that</b> was regarded by EU commentators as a sign of support by Switzerland, a country that is traditionally perceived as independent and reluctant to enter supranational bodies.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas where}} there is little iodine in the diet, {{typically}} remote inland areas and semi-arid equatorial climates where no marine foods are eaten, iodine deficiency gives rise to hypothyroidism, symptoms of which are extreme fatigue, goitre, mental slowing, depression, weight gain, and low basal body temperatures. Iodine deficiency {{is the leading cause}} of preventable intellectual disability, <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>that</b> occurs primarily when babies or small children are rendered hypothyroidic by a lack of the element. The addition of iodine to table salt has largely eliminated this problem in the wealthier nations, but iodine deficiency remains a serious public health problem today in the developing world. Iodine deficiency is also a problem in certain areas of Europe. Information processing, fine motor skills, and visual problem solving are improved by iodine repletion in moderately iodine-deficient children.|$|E

Three weeks later Juventus again lost by one goal on their travels, Pajtim Kasami scoring {{in the first}} half for Olympiacos, whose goalkeeper Roberto played a key role. On 4 November, hosting the Greeks, Juventus won 3–2 after trailing 1–2, getting two goals in as many minutes from Roberto's own goal and Paul Pogba's winning strike.|$|E

5|$|Worthington's first {{match in}} charge was a 3–2 defeat away to AFC Wimbledon, in which Chris Smith scored twice, before Harry Pell scored the home team's {{winner in the}} 79th minute. York picked up their first point under Worthington after a 0–0 home draw with Rochdale, with both teams having few {{opportunities}} to score. Ipswich Town midfielder Josh Carson was signed on a one-month loan, while Bullock was loaned to Stockport County of the Conference Premier {{for the rest of}} the season. Carson made his debut in York's 2–0 home defeat to Port Vale, who scored in each half through Jennison Myrie-Williams and Lee Hughes. Former York striker Richard Cresswell, who became the club's record sale in 1999, was signed from Sheffield United on a one-month loan. He scored a penalty in the team's 2–1 defeat away to Torquay, <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>that</b> saw York drop into the second relegation spot. Sunderland midfielder Adam Reed was signed on a one-month loan, while Ible was released. Adam Reed made his debut as York drew 0–0 away to Bristol Rovers, in which the home team's goalkeeper Steve Mildenhall made a number of saves.|$|E
5|$|Young {{played for}} Altrincham in their FA Cup first round match and first round replay against League Two team Luton Town, {{with the latter}} being lost 4–2 in a penalty shoot-out. His first goal of 2008–09 came after scoring from close range in the 74th-minute of a 1–0 away victory over Northwich on 26 December 2008. His second goal of the season came with a header from Doughty's free kick on 52 minutes in a 1–0 away win over Wrexham on 13 April 2009, <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>that</b> ensured Altrincham would not finish the season in the relegation zone.

5|$|A 2–1 away defeat to Barrow saw {{the team}} {{knocked out of}} the FA Trophy in the quarter-final, Pacquette scoring for York. York {{suffered}} a second straight league defeat after being beaten 2–1 away by Forest Green Rovers, in which Mackin scored after his shot hit {{the back of an}} opposition player. Chester's expulsion from the Football Conference resulted in York having the three points gained against them from a 3–2 victory expunged, meaning the team moved down to sixth in the table. York were defeated 2–1 at home by Salisbury, after Sangaré had put the team in the lead. Chesterfield midfielder Paul Harsley joined on loan {{until the end of the}} season, and made his debut in a 0–0 draw away to Altrincham, <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>that</b> ended a run of three consecutive defeats. York's first victory in six league matches was a 1–0 away win over Mansfield, Pitt scoring his first goal for the club. McWilliams was loaned out to Northern Premier League Premier Division club Whitby Town for one month. A second successive victory came after Barrett scored the only goal in a 1–0 away victory over Kidderminster. Graham opened the scoring in a 1–1 home draw with Tamworth, who equalised through former York player Chris Smith. A 4–0 victory away to Grays saw Brodie score for the first time since January 2010 with two goals; Harsley and Barrett also scored.|$|E

5|$|Bewick {{made use}} of his close {{observation}} of nature, his remarkable visual memory, and his sharp eyesight to create accurate and extremely small details in his wood engravings, which proved to be both a strength and a weakness. If properly printed and closely examined, his prints could be seen to convey subtle clues {{to the character of}} his natural subjects, with humour and feeling. This was achieved by carefully varying the depth of the engraved grooves to provide actual greys, not only black and white, as well as the pattern of the marks to provide texture. But this subtlety of engraving created a serious technical difficulty for his printers; they needed to ink his blocks with {{just the right amount of}} ink, mixed so as to be of exactly the right thickness, and to press the block to the paper slowly and carefully, to obtain <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>that</b> would satisfy Bewick. Not surprisingly, this made printing slow and expensive. It also created a problem for Bewick's readers; if they lacked his excellent eyesight, they needed a magnifying glass to study his prints, especially the miniature tail-pieces. But the effect was transformative, and wood engraving became the main method of illustrating books for a century. The quality of Bewick's engravings attracted a far wider readership to his books than he had expected: his Fables and Quadrupeds were at the outset intended for children.|$|E
5|$|Cresswell {{retired from}} playing {{as a result}} of an eye {{complaint}} and a knee injury. York drew 1–1 away to Burton Albion, with an own goal scored by Shane Cansdell-Sherriff giving York the lead in the 64th minute before the home team equalised eight minutes later through Billy Kee. Atkinson was released after failing to force himself into the first team and signed for Scarborough Athletic, with whom he had been on loan. York drew 0–0 at home with second-placed Oxford United, in which Carson came closest to scoring with a volley that flashed across the face of the goal. This was followed by another draw after the match awa to Accrington Stanley finished 1–1, with the home team equalising 10 minutes after a Fletcher penalty had given York the lead in the 35th minute. Striker Shaq McDonald, who had been released by Peterborough United, was signed on a contract until the end of the season. York's last match of 2013 was a 2–1 defeat away to Bury, <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>that</b> ended York's run of consecutive draws at five. The home team were 2–0 up by the 19th minute, before Michael Coulson scored York's goal in the 73rd minute. This result meant York would begin 2014 in 22nd-position in the table, only out of the relegation zone on goal difference.|$|E
5|$|During the close-season, Johnson {{sought a}} {{possible}} new club back in England, {{and before the}} start of the 2010 season in America, he was given a trial with Major League Soccer side Seattle Sounders FC joining them for their pre-season training camp. Having trained with Sounders, Johnson decided to stay with Austin Aztex and signed a new two-year contract. In the first game of the Aztex season, Johnson hit the goalpost with a 20-yard curling shot, but Lawrence Olum scored with the rebound, helping the Aztex to a 2–0 victory against Montreal Impact. During May, Johnson scored five goals, including two in a 3–3 draw with Tampa Bay and made two assists to help Austin record an unbeaten spell. He again scored two goals in a 2–1 Aztex victory over Miami and helped take his team to the top of the table by being the club's leading goalscorer throughout the campaign. Heath also used him in his original position in attack, including as a sole striker in a defeat to Puerto Rico Islanders. It was <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>that</b> saw the Aztex lose their top spot for the first time in three months. A week later, Johnson scored his tenth goal of the season to give his side their fourth win in five games by defeating Carolina RailHawks 3–2. The Aztex returned to the top of the table with a 2–0 victory against NSC Minnesota Stars with Johnson scoring the opening goal of the game. Aztex qualified for the end-of-season play-offs where they faced Montreal Impact over two legs. Johnson scored one of Aztex's two goals in the second leg but their season finished with a 5–2 aggregate defeat. Johnson played a total of 28 games during the season, scoring 15 goals, and earned a place in the 2010 season best XI.|$|E

5|$|He scored {{twice for}} York in a 3–2 home victory over League Two team Crewe Alexandra in the FA Cup first round on 7 November 2009, which {{included}} the first and final goals. Following this, he was voted Player of the Round for the FA Cup first round. In the following match, he scored his first hat-trick for York, with three goals in a 3–2 home win over Chester City on 10 November 2009. After picking up a yellow card against AFC Wimbledon on 21 November 2009, Brodie was handed a one-match suspension, which resulted in him missing a match against Gateshead. He was named the Conference Premier Player of the Month for November 2009, during which he scored six goals in five appearances. Brodie scored his 20th goal {{of the season in}} a 2–1 home victory over Wrexham, <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>that</b> equalled the club record for successive victories in all competitions with eight. This goal broke the club record for reaching 20 goals in a season in the quickest time, beating Arthur Bottom's record by six days. Brodie played for York in the FA Cup third round against Premier League team Stoke City, in which they were beaten 3–1 away. He scored two goals and provided an assist in a 4–1 home win over Hayes & Yeading United, which broke the club record for consecutive league victories with eight. League Two team Grimsby Town made an offer for Brodie in January 2010, with chairman John Fenty's offer being rejected as it did not meet York's valuation.|$|E
5|$|On {{transfer}} deadline day, McCombe {{left the}} club after agreeing a severance package, and Sinclair joined National League club Guiseley on a one-month loan. York lost 2–0 away to top-of-the-table Northampton Town, who scored in each half through John-Joe O'Toole and Marc Richards, and had Hendrie sent {{off for a}} foul on Ricky Holmes. Cameron's loan was extended {{until the end of}} the season, having impressed in his four starts for the club. York won successive home wins for the first time in 2015–16 after they beat Notts County 2–1, <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>that</b> saw them move off the bottom of the table into 23rd place. Coulson opened the scoring on 24 minutes after lobbing goalkeeper Roy Carroll from 15yards before Fewster scored from close range from McEvoy's cross in the 39th minute. County recorded a consolation goal after Šatka scored an own goal in the second half. York moved out of the relegation into 22nd place with a 2–0 home win over Exeter, and in doing so ended the club's longest run without a clean sheet since 1967, after 23 matches. Fewster scored both goals, the first in the 35th minute with a low shot at close range from Coulson's pass, and the second in the 64th minute with a shot from the edge of the penalty area.|$|E
