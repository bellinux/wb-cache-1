5|$|The Clause {{has led to}} {{very little}} litigation, {{in part because of}} its overlap (as a {{practical}} matter) with the venue provision of Article Three and Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

5|$|The black-throated gray warbler breeds {{in western}} North America, its range {{extending}} from southwestern British Columbia along the Pacific coast to northern Baja California, and east to New Mexico and southern Montana. It winters mostly in Mexico, from southern Baja California to Oaxaca state. It has spread into parts of Wyoming <b>and</b> <b>Montana</b> only recently, as Juniperus osteosperma {{has expanded its}} range due to a warming climate. Vagrants have been recorded across eastern North America and in Cuba.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{the forests}} of the {{watershed}} were not significantly affected, but after logging operations sprung up near {{the start of the}} 20th century, most of the virgin timber in the watershed was cleared. The first sawmills were built to provide lumber for local uses, such as building houses and barns. Soon, however, the Washington, Idaho <b>and</b> <b>Montana</b> Railway extended its tracks into the area, allowing lumber to be exported out of the basin. Logging {{turned out to be a}} very profitable industry but had a lasting negative effect on the ecology of the Potlatch River watershed.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the years}} {{there have been}} {{periodic}} attempts to restore service in southern Montana and North Dakota. A proposed plan from 1982–1983 would have involved North Dakota <b>and</b> <b>Montana</b> paying 45% of costs {{in the first year}} and 65% thereafter of a new section of the Empire Builder operating tri-weekly between Fargo and Sandpoint. This proposal went nowhere as neither state voted funds. Another proposal mooted in 1991 would have required an additional yearly federal appropriation of $12–15 million plus new equipment. In this scenario the Portland section would operate over the old route. Again, nothing came of it.|$|E
5|$|Paul came in 5th {{place in}} both the January 4 Iowa caucuses (10% of votes cast) and the January 8 New Hampshire primary (8%). With the {{exception}} of the Nevada caucuses January 19, where he came in 2nd (14%) behind Romney (51%), he did little better through the rest of January: Michigan 4th (6%), South Carolina 5th (4%), Florida 5th (3%). On SuperTuesday, February 5, he placed 4th in almost every state, generally taking in a mere 3–6% of the votes although he did better in the northern states of North Dakota (21%, 3rd place) <b>and</b> <b>Montana</b> (25%, 2nd place).|$|E
5|$|Schwimmer {{concluded}} in 2002 that the feeding patterns of Deinosuchus most likely varied by geographic location; the smaller Deinosuchus specimens of eastern North America {{would have been}} opportunistic feeders in an ecological niche {{similar to that of}} the modern American alligator. They would have consumed marine turtles, large fish, and smaller dinosaurs. The bigger, but less common, Deinosuchus that lived in Texas <b>and</b> <b>Montana</b> might have been more specialized hunters, capturing and eating large dinosaurs. Schwimmer noted no theropod dinosaurs in Deinosuchuss eastern range approached its size, indicating the massive crocodilian could have been the region's apex predator.|$|E

5|$|Several major North American {{drainage}} basins {{and many}} minor ones {{share a common}} border with the Columbia River's drainage basin. To the east, in northern Wyoming <b>and</b> <b>Montana,</b> the Continental Divide separates the Columbia watershed from the Mississippi-Missouri watershed, which empties into the Gulf of Mexico. To the northeast, mostly along the southern border between British Columbia and Alberta, the Continental Divide separates the Columbia watershed from the Nelson-Lake Winnipeg-Saskatchewan watershed, which empties into Hudson Bay. The Mississippi and Nelson watersheds are separated by the Laurentian Divide, which meets the Continental Divide at Triple Divide Peak near {{the headwaters of the}} Columbia's Flathead River tributary. This point marks the meeting of three of North America's main drainage patterns, to the Pacific Ocean, to Hudson Bay, and to the Atlantic Ocean via the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|South Dakota is {{situated}} in the north-central United States, and {{is considered to be}} a part of the Midwest by the U.S. Census Bureau, although the Great Plains region also covers the state. Additionally, the culture, economy, and geography of western South Dakota has more in common with the West than the Midwest. The state has a total land area of 77,116sq.miles (199,905km2), making it the 17th largest in the Union. South Dakota is bordered to the north by North Dakota; to the south by Nebraska; to the east by Iowa and Minnesota; and to the west by Wyoming <b>and</b> <b>Montana.</b> The western border is the Black Hills meridian, a north-south line set out at a certain distance from Washington, D.C., to separate South Dakota from Montana and Wyoming during the transition to statehood.|$|E
5|$|The Kirtlandian is {{an age of}} fauna {{that lasted}} for 2 million years. It is Campanian in age, and is placed between the Judithian age, which is {{characterized}} by older taxa, and the Edmontonian faunal age, characterized {{by the appearance of}} Edmontosaurus regalis and Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis. The geological formations found to date or persist from the Kirtlandian are the Bearpaw, the upper Kaiparowits Formation, the Kirtland, Fruitland, Williams Fork, Fort Crittenden, Ringbone, Corral de Enmedio, Packard, and El Gallo formations, and possibly {{the lower part of the}} Cerro del Pueblo Formation and upper region of the Aguja Formation.

5|$|With the Coinage Act of 1873, {{the dollar}} {{was no longer}} {{equivalent}} to a set amount of silver, a statutory change made so that {{as the price of}} silver dropped with increased U.S. production, mining companies could not present their bullion at the mints and receive it back, struck into silver dollars worth more as money than they were as metal. By the post-World War II era, the Bureau of the Mint was striking the three remaining precious metal coins, the dime, quarter and half dollar in 90 percent silver—the dollar had not been coined since 1935 and circulated little outside some Western states like Nevada <b>and</b> <b>Montana.</b> The metal in a silver dollar was worth more as bullion than as money above $1.2929 per troy ounce; the smaller coins would be attractive for the melting pot above $1.38 per ounce.|$|E
5|$|After {{the island}} was {{evacuated}} it was first tenanted and then purchased in 1919 by Jonathan MacLean from Barra. In 1930 it was sold to John Russell who had experience as a sheep farmer in both Australia <b>and</b> <b>Montana.</b> Russell was clearly a man who liked his own company, choosing {{to live on the}} island alone all autumn and winter with his pet ferrets and cats, and joined by two shepherds for the spring and summer only. After seven years he sold up to Peggy Greer, a farmer from Essex who visited only rarely and let the grazings out to local farmers. In 1951 she attempted to sell the island herself, but without success until 1955 when a local crofters' syndicate called the Barra Head Isles Sheepstock Company completed the purchase. The advent of motor boats made stocking the islands considerably easier and the company’s ownership continued for the next forty years.|$|E
5|$|Dora Caroline Stevens {{was born}} on October 26, 1888 in Omaha, Nebraska to Caroline D. (née Koopman) and Henry Henderbourck Stevens.

One of four children, Stevens grew up in Omaha and graduated in 1905 from Omaha High School. She went on to further her education graduating from Oberlin College in 1911 with a degree in sociology, though she had originally pursued music. While in college, she was known for her romances and for being a spirited suffragette. Her unruly behavior and disdain for feminine propriety were cultivated during her college years. After graduation, Stevens worked as a music teacher and social worker in Ohio, Michigan. <b>and</b> <b>Montana</b> before moving to Washington, D.C., where she became a regional organizer with the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA).|$|E
