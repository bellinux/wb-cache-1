25|$|The game {{is divided}} into three steps. The player has firstly access to {{information}} about the vent and its context, using timelines and maps. Then, he can play successively as the different protagonists of the event. He is asked to make a decision, following what he thinks the stakeholder should do. Finally, the player predicts shich decision the protagonist will make. When the player comes again later, he is informed of the decisions that were made in the real world. Play the News is built around <b>a</b> <b>community,</b> <b>where</b> every player has a profile. He may read statistics on the accuracy of his predictions and the tendency of his opinions (mainstream or fringe within the community).|$|E
25|$|Peerage of Science is an {{independent}} service and <b>a</b> <b>community</b> <b>where</b> reviewer recruitment happens via Open Engagement: authors submit their manuscript to the service where it is made accessible for any non-affiliated scientist, and 'validated users' choose themselves {{what they want to}} review. The motivation to participate as a peer reviewer comes from a reputation system where the quality of the reviewing work is judged and scored by other users, and contributes to user profiles. Peerage of Science does not charge any fees to scientists, and does not pay peer reviewers. Participating publishers however pay to use the service, gaining access to all ongoing processes and the opportunity to make publishing offers to the authors.|$|E
500|$|Irons {{proposed}} that costly signalling theory could explain costly religious behaviour. He argued that hard-to-fake religious displays enhanced trust and solidarity in a community, producing emotional and economic benefits. He showed that display signals among the Yomut Turkmen of northern Iran helped to secure trade agreements. These [...] "ostentatious" [...] displays signalled commitment to Islam to strangers and group members. Sosis demonstrated {{that people in}} religious communities are {{four times more likely}} to live longer than their secular counterparts, and that these longer lifespans were positively correlated with the number of costly requirements demanded from religious community members. However, confounding variables may not have been excluded. Wood found that religion offers a subjective feeling of well-being within <b>a</b> <b>community,</b> <b>where</b> costly signalling protects against free riders and helps to build self-control among committed members. Iannaccone studied the effects of costly signals on religious communities. In a self-reported survey, as the strictness of a church increased, the attendance and contributions to that church increased proportionally. In effect, people were more willing to participate in a church that has more stringent demands on its members. Despite this observation, costly donations and acts conducted in a religious context does not itself establish that membership in these clubs is actually worth the entry costs imposed.|$|E

60|$|That {{the most}} mediæval of modern institutions, the Trades Unions, do not {{fight for the}} same ideal of æsthetic finish is true and {{certainly}} tragic; but {{to make it a}} matter of blame is wholly to misunderstand the tragedy. The Trades Unions are confederations of men without property, seeking to balance its absence by numbers and the necessary character of their labour. The Guilds were confederations of men with property, seeking to ensure each man in the possession of that property. This is, of course, the only condition of affairs in which property can properly be said to exist at all. We should not speak of a negro community in which most men were white, but the rare negroes were giants. We should not conceive a married community in which most men were bachelors, and three men had harems. A married community means <b>a</b> <b>community</b> <b>where</b> most people are married; not <b>a</b> <b>community</b> <b>where</b> one or two people are very much married. A propertied community means <b>a</b> <b>community</b> <b>where</b> most people have property; not <b>a</b> <b>community</b> <b>where</b> there are a few capitalists. But in fact the Guildsmen (as also, for that matter, the serfs, semi-serfs and peasants) were much richer than can be realized even {{from the fact that the}} Guilds protected the possession of houses, tools, and just payment. The surplus is self-evident upon any just study of the prices of the period, when all deductions have been made, of course, for the different value of the actual coinage. When a man could get a goose or a gallon of ale for one or two of the smallest and commonest coins, the matter is in no way affected by the name of those coins. Even where the individual wealth was severely limited, the collective wealth was very large--the wealth of the Guilds, of the parishes, and especially of the monastic estates. It is important to remember this fact in the subsequent history of England.|$|E

60|$|Important, however, {{as these}} {{critical}} points {{in his career}} may be reckoned by his relatives, they are scarcely calculated to prove equally epochal to the man himself. In <b>a</b> <b>community</b> <b>where</b> next to no note is ever taken of the anniversary of his birth, some doubt as to the special significance of that red-letter day may not unnaturally creep into his own mind.

Human nature is so earth-tied, after all, that a post-mundane existence is very apt to seem immaterial as well as be so.|$|E
