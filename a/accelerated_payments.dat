The borrower may terminate the arrangement at any time but receives no principal reduction if he makes less than 12 consecutive increased payments. The issue is how the lender should account for the portion of principal that may be forgiven. 1. Should the lender assume that the <b>accelerated</b> <b>payments</b> will be made to maturity and discount such <b>accelerated</b> <b>payments</b> using the current interest rate, thus recording a loss? 2. Should the lender assume that only 12 consecutive increased payments will be made and that other payments to maturity will be at the original rate and discount all payments using the current interest rate, thus recording a smaller loss? 3. Should the discount only be recorded as a loss when the borrower has made all the payments required or should the discount be accrued as a loss pro rata over the 12 -month period? EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force reached a consensus that, assuming it is probable that the borrower will continue to make the increased payments for the specified period, the expense relating to the partial forgiveness should be accrued over the period of increased payments. Task Force members indicated that this approach to the accounting has already been consistently applied in practice...|$|E

50|$|Dynamic Discounting {{describes}} {{a collection of}} methods in which payment terms can be established between a buyer and supplier to <b>accelerate</b> <b>payment</b> for goods or services {{in return for a}} reduced price or discount. Dynamic Discounting methods are used for business-to-business transactions when contractual or pre-established early payment terms may not exist or the payment date does not conform to agreed upon discount terms. Dynamic Discounting includes the ability to agree upon terms that vary the discount according to the date of early payment. The earlier the payment, the greater the discount. In addition, it includes an ability for either buyer or supplier to propose an early payment date and discount for a one-time payment using electronic mail or specialized software. Through the use of dynamic discounting methods, buying organizations can increase the number and size of early payment discounts they receive and suppliers can get paid sooner at a lower cost of capital than alternative options. A range of concepts is available to implement dynamic discounting into supply chain finance (SCF): dynamic discounting {{can be seen as a}} comparatively simple form, whereby the supplier grants a cash discount for early payment of its invoices - the amount of the reduction and the time of payment are quickly and freely negotiable.|$|R

Their importance for business success is undisputed, as bankruptcies due to insufficient cash flow underline. Therefore, this study investigated current business practices of electrical contracting companies of different sizes with respect to their financial planning and management. A detailed questionnaire was developed with best guidelines on survey studies and pilot testing. It was sent to members of the National Electrical Contractors Association.

Each section allowed feedback to clarify the numerical responses. Responses were well distributed across company sizes, so that the results are representative for the entire industry. The results indicated that contractors generally have a substantial amount of experience in financial decision making. Their approach is conservative and focuses on healthy growth. Yet, opportunities to fine-tune business practices are identified, e. g., immediate invoicing, considering discounts to <b>accelerate</b> <b>payment</b> receipts, attempting to negotiate and use favorable credit terms, reviewing payment performance, and performing frequent cash flow forecasts.

Progress with the drafting of Partnership Agreements is generally on schedule and the aim is to submit formally the majority of PAs towards the end of 2013.

We find that unanticipated permanent changes in tax rates have only small effects on aggregate investment, since macroeconomic dynamics are dominated by mature firms for which dividend taxation is not distortionary. Anticipated or temporary dividend tax changes, on the other hand, create incentives for firms to engage in inter-temporal tax arbitrage so as to reduce investors' tax burden. For example, a temporary tax cut - the type {{most likely to be}} enacted by policymakers - induces firms to <b>accelerate</b> dividend <b>payments</b> while tax rates are low, which reduces their cash holdings and makes them capital-constrained when large investment opportunities arise.

40|$|Changes {{in species}} {{richness}} along the ecological succession gradient may be strongly determined by coexisting extinction debts of species {{from the original}} habitats and colonization credits of those from the replacing habitats. The magnitude of these processes and their causes remain largely unknown. We explored the extinction debt and colonization credit for grassland and forest specialist plants, respectively, and the local and landscape factors associated to the richness of these species groups in a 50 -year process of forest encroachment into semi-natural Mediterranean grasslands. A set of sampling plots of persistent grasslands and forests and their transitional habitat (wooded grasslands) was selected within fixed-area sites distributed across the landscape. Our results confirm the extinction debt and suggest colonization credit (according to observed trends and model predictions) in wooded grasslands when compared to persistent forests, despite wooded grasslands and persistent forests having similar tree cover.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} effects of changes in {{dividend}} tax policy using a life-cycle model of the firm, in which new firms first access equity markets, then grow internally, and finally pay dividends when they have reached steady state. In accordance with the traditional view of dividend taxation, new firms raise less equity and invest less the higher the level of dividend taxes. However, as postulated by the new view of dividend taxation, the dividend tax rate is irrelevant for the investment decisions of internally growing and mature firms. Since aggregate investment is dominated by these latter two categories, the level of dividend taxation as well as unanticipated changes in tax rates have only small effects on aggregate investment. Anticipated dividend tax changes, on the other hand, allow firms to engage in inter-temporal tax arbitrage so as to reduce investors' tax burden. This can significantly distort aggregate investment. Anticipated tax cuts (increases) delay (<b>accelerate)</b> firms' dividend <b>payments,</b> which leads them to hold higher (lower) cash balances and, for capital constrained firms, can significantly increase (decrease) aggregate investment for periods after the tax change.
