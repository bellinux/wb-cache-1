40|$|An active {{factor in}} streptococci which precipitated various {{mammalian}} plasmas and human and bovine fibrinogens was previously described (1). This fibrinogen-precipitating factor (FPF) {{was present in}} crude acid extracts of several strains of Group A streptococci. The identity of FPF and streptococcal M protein was suggested by: (a) absorption of M protein extracts with fibrinogen resulted in loss of precipitation with homologous anti-M antisera; (b) absorption of M extracts with homologous anti-M antisera resulted in loss of precipitation with fibrinogen; and (c) treatment of M extracts with pepsin or trypsin resulted in loss of precipitation with both <b>anti-M</b> <b>antiserum</b> and fibrinogen. The present report describes experiments confirming the identity of FPF and M protein. Precipitates were prepared by reaction of human fibrinogen with a partially purified preparation of streptococcal M protein known to contain FPF. Immunization of rabbits with washed precipitates resulted in bactericidal, mouse protective, and "long-chain " antibodies directed against homologous streptococci, lmmunoelectrophoretic analysis of sera from these rabbits wa...|$|E
40|$|The immune {{response}} of experimentally infected hamsters and human patients to Mycoplasma pneumoniae was examined by radioimmunoprecipation {{in conjunction with}} gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Both intrinsically and extrinsically labeled mycoplasma proteins were coincubated with acute and convalescent sera in a radioimmunoprecipitation assay. Two M. pneumoniae proteins were selectively precipitated by convalescent sera. These predominant immunogens were trypsin-sensitive, antibody-accessible surface proteins that co-migrate on polyacrylamide gels with proteins P 1 and P 2, which were previously implicated by us as mediators of cytadsorption. <b>Anti-M.</b> pneumoniae <b>antiserum</b> did not precipitate radiolabeled antigens derived from Mycoplasma orale or Mycoplasma salivarium. These data indicate that M. pneumoniae infection stimulates a specific and highly targeted host antibody response to key proteinaceous immunogens...|$|R
40|$|No. 21 mycobacterial antigens of Mycobacterium lepraemurium, M. avium, M. fortuitum, and M. leprae were {{compared}} in crossed immunoelectrophoresis using two different antibody sources, a serum pool from lepromatous leprosy patients (LSII) and a rabbit <b>anti-M.</b> smegmatis <b>antiserum.</b> M. lepraemurium, like M. avium, {{was found to}} contain the 21 A and 21 C determinants. M. fortuitum contained in addition {{a new type of}} determinant, 21 D. M. leprae antigen no. 21 carried the A as well as the B dertminants, the latter found so far only in the leprosy bacillus. The separate taxonomic position of M. leprae, suggested by earlier studies of the no. 21 antigen, is further supported by the present results, which also demonstrate the potential use of submolecular heterogeneity for such investigations...|$|R
40|$|Mycoplasma fermentans (strain 'incognitus') was {{incubated}} with HeLa {{cells for}} up to 96 h. After 24 h, mycoplasma organisms were demonstrated intracellularly by immunocytochemistry using mule <b>anti-M.</b> fermentans <b>antiserum</b> and gold labelling on ultrathin sections of both Lowicryl K 4 M and Araldite-embedded HeLa cells, the latter being treated with hydrogen peroxide. The Araldite-embedded cells were fixed with glutaraldehyde and osmium tetroxide {{in the presence of}} ruthenium red to stain the mucopolysaccharide surface components of both the procaryotic and eucaryotic cells. Intracellular localization of some M. fermentans organisms was confirmed by exclusion of ruthenium red from their membranes. Various numbers of mycoplasma organisms were seen per cell and occasionally some were within vacuoles, the membranes of which were also unstained by ruthenium red. The PG 18 strain of M. fermentans and a strain of M. hominis were also detected intracellularly using similar methodology and homologous mule or rabbit antisera. The occasional presence of both apparently normal and some denser degenerate mycoplasmas in the same cell may indicate gradual degradation by phagolysosomal digestion...|$|R
40|$|Cell of Mycoplasma pneumoniae FH gliding on a {{glass surface}} in liquid medium were {{examined}} by microscopic observation and quantitatively by microcinematography (30 frames per min). Comparisons were made {{only within the}} individual experiments. The cells moved in an irregular pattern with numerous narrow bends and circles. They never changed their leading end. The average speed (without pauses) was relatively constant between o. 2 and 0. 5 mum/s. The maximum speed was about 1. 5 to 2. 0 mum/s. The movements were interrupted by resting periods of different lengths and frequency. Temperature, viscosity, pH, {{and the presence of}} yeast extract in the medium influenced the motility significantly; changes in glucose, calcium ions, and serum content were less effective. The movements were affected by iodoacetate, p-mercuribenzoate, and mitomycin C at inhibitory or subinhibitory concentrations. Sodium fluoride, sodium cyanide, dinitrophenol, chloramphenicol, puromycin, cholchicin, and cytochalasin B at minimal inhibitory concentrations did not affect motility. The movements were effectively inhibited by <b>anti-M.</b> pneumoniae <b>antiserum.</b> Studies with absorbed antiserum suggested that the surface components involved in motility are heat labile. The gliding of M. pneumoniae cells required an intact energy metabolism and the proteins involved seemed to have a low turnover...|$|R
40|$|The {{serological}} {{activities of}} the specific phenolic glycolipid I from Mycobacterium leprae, its dissected parts, and related glycolipids from other mycobacteria were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against hyperimmune <b>anti-M.</b> leprae rabbit <b>antiserum</b> and sera from patients with leprosy and other mycobacterial diseases. High anti-phenolic glycolipid I immunoglobulin M antibodies were found in 23 of 24 (96 %) of lepromatous leprosy patients on short term chemotherapy and in 8 of 13 tuberculoid leprosy patients (62 %). Sera from patients with tuberculosis or atypical mycobacterial infections were devoid of anti-phenolic glycolipid I activity. The structurally related phenolic glycolipids from Mycobacterium kansasii and Mycobacterium bovis and the aglycone segments of the M. leprae product showed no significant activity. Thus, the trisaccharide determinant of phenolic glycolipid I is specific in its structure, serological activity, and, to a lesser extent, the antibody class it evokes...|$|R
40|$|The human {{pathogen}} Mycoplasma pneumoniae adheres {{to a variety}} of cells, including erythrocytes. A hemadsorption technique was developed to quantitate adherence by photometric measurement of lysates of erythrocytes that attached to sheets of M. pneumoniae grown in cups of Linbro plates. Attachment of sheep erythrocytes (SE) increased with higher ionic strength, was unaffected by minor pH variations (6 to 9), and was blocked by <b>anti-M.</b> pneumoniae <b>antiserum,</b> but was not inhibited by a variety of sugars, amino acids, and bovine serum albumin. The reaction was time and temperature dependent. The temperature curve showed peaks at 14 and 28 °C with untreated SE but only one peak at about 38 °C with glutaraldehyde-treated SE. The temperature dependence indicated involvement of either metabolic or membrane activities in the binding process. Trypsin treatment of the M. pneumoniae sheet abolished adherence of SE but was only partially effective with human erythrocytes and noneffective with rabbit erythrocytes. The binding capacity of the mycoplasma cells for SE was restored by incubation in growth medium for 3 to 4 h; this restoration was inhibited by 10 μg of chloramphenicol per ml. Neuraminidase treatment of SE removed their attachment capacity but had no effect on attachment of rabbit erythrocytes and only a slight effect on attachment of human erythrocytes. Pretreatment of M. pneumoniae with neuraminic acid partially blocked the adherence of SE, whereas rabbit erythrocyte attachment was not affected. Attached SE could be detached by trypsin, but not by neuraminidase. For human and rabbit erythrocytes, the results suggest binding mechanisms other than the interaction between neuraminidase-sensitive receptors and protein-containing binding sites shown for SE...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} and serological relatedness of the pilus proteins of several isolates of Haemophilus influenzae type b cultured from patients with invasive disease and from different anatomic sites {{within the same}} patient was examined. Epithelial cell-adherent variants of 25 nonadherent parent isolates were obtained by selection for organisms that adhered to human erythrocytes. Outer membrane protein analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed {{the presence of an}} additional 24 - to 24. 5 -kilodalton protein among all adherent variants but absent from all nonadherent parent isolates. Polyclonal rabbit antiserum against the intact native pilus protein of H. influenzae M 43 cross-reacted with 20 of 25 adherent H. influenzae in both immunodot and slide-agglutination assays. No differences in reactivity among isolates cultured from more than one anatomic site in the same patient were noted. <b>Anti-M</b> 43 pilus <b>antiserum</b> had bactericidal activity against both the homologous strain and a heterologous strain that demonstrated serologic identity in the immunodot and slide agglutination assays. The adherence of these strains to human epithelial cells in vitro was inhibited by Fab fragments purified from the antipilus antiserum. These data indicate that a remarkable degree of homogeneity in pilin subunit size exists among the pili of H. influenzae type b and that major antigenic determinants are shared among most of these pili. Also, antibodies directed against H. influenzae pilus proteins may be able to contribute to host defenses through serum bactericidal activity and by blocking the adherence of this bacterium to host epithelial cells...|$|R
