5|$|Astrophysicist Alice C. Quillen and her student Stephen Thorndike {{performed}} {{computer simulations}} {{of the structure}} of the dust disk around Epsilon Eridani. Their model suggested that the clumping of the dust particles could be explained by the presence of a second planet in <b>an</b> <b>eccentric</b> orbit, which they announced in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Determining {{the nature}} of the planet has not been straightforward; a 2002 paper hypothesizes that the clumps are caused by a roughly Jupiter-mass planet on <b>an</b> <b>eccentric</b> orbit. Dust would collect in orbits that have mean-motion {{resonances}} with this planet—where their orbital periods form integer fractions with the period of the planet—producing the resulting clumpiness.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{recapture}} 5.cxd5, Black has <b>an</b> <b>eccentric</b> {{option in}} 5...Bd6, the Snake Benoni. But most players prefer 5...d6, which stops White's d-pawn from advancing to d6. Black's {{control over the}} central dark squares d4 and e5 will then be augmented by fianchettoing the bishop on g7. Meanwhile, White must {{decide whether or not}} to play 6.e4. Although this move gains space in the centre, it also gives Black a target of attack on the half-open e-file. White can deny Black this target for the time being by playing 6.Nf3 first.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the observed double nucleus could be explained if P1 is the projection of a disk of stars in <b>an</b> <b>eccentric</b> orbit around the central black hole. The eccentricity is such that stars linger at the orbital apocenter, creating a concentration of stars. P2 also contains a compact disk of hot, spectral class A stars. The A stars are not evident in redder filters, but in blue and ultraviolet light they dominate the nucleus, causing P2 to appear more prominent than P1.|$|E

A former {{undercover}} agent known for his work with cultists, which caused him to sustain multiple massive mutilations and driven {{to the brink of}} insanity. He has a problem with women screaming at him. Jackson opted to cast Combs as Dammers because he was a fan of the actor's work in Re-Animator.|$|E
5|$|Paulet was {{something}} of <b>an</b> <b>eccentric.</b> On one occasion, while his ship was moored at Spithead, he asked his admiral for permission to take leave to visit London. This was refused, with the comment that Paulet could travel as far on land as he could get in his barge. Thus challenged, Paulet loaded his barge onto a cart {{and went off to}} London anyway.|$|E
5|$|Seven star {{systems have}} been found to have planets. Nu2 Canis Majoris is an ageing orange giant of {{spectral}} type K1III of apparent magnitude 3.91 located around 64 light-years distant. Around 1.5 times as massive and 11 times as luminous as the Sun, it is orbited over a period of 763 days by a planet 2.6 times as massive as Jupiter. HD 47536 is likewise an ageing orange giant found to have a planetary system—echoing the fate of the Solar System in a few billion years as the Sun ages and becomes a giant. Conversely, HD 45364 is a star 107 light-years distant that is a little smaller and cooler than the Sun, of spectral type G8V, which has two planets discovered in 2008. With orbital periods of 228 and 342 days, the planets have a 3:2 orbital resonance, which helps stabilise the system. HD 47186 is another sunlike star with two planets; the inner—HD 47186 b—takes four days to complete an orbit and has been classified as a Hot Neptune, while the outer—HD 47186 c—has <b>an</b> <b>eccentric</b> 3.7-year period orbit and has a similar mass to Saturn. HD 43197 is a sunlike star around 183 light-years distant that has a Jupiter-size planet with <b>an</b> <b>eccentric</b> orbit.|$|E

5|$|Some of the {{characteristic}} traits of Kim's mature style, first seen {{in these three}} films, are gothic excess, surrealism, horror, perversions and sexuality. Although {{in stark contrast to}} the realism, harmony, balance and sentimentality typical of Korean cinema of the time, Kim's films, in <b>an</b> <b>eccentric</b> and metaphorical way, deal with the realities of postwar, industrializing South Korean society and psychology. After having firmly established his auteur status with these films, Kim's unique vision began to wane in his films of the later 1960s.|$|E
5|$|After {{consulting}} with Deep Throat, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) travels to Townsend and takes {{photos of the}} crash site, only to be captured. After being interrogated by Henderson, Mulder is detained alongside <b>an</b> <b>eccentric</b> NICAP member named Max Fenig (Scott Bellis), who was also captured in the woods. The next morning, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrives to retrieve Mulder, telling him that FBI Section Chief Joseph McGrath is threatening {{to shut down the}} X-Files because of his behavior. She also claims that the wreckage has been identified as a downed Libyan fighter jet; Mulder dismisses this explanation. Meanwhile, the invisible occupant of the UFO passes through an electronic fence set up around the crash site, escaping into the outside world.|$|E
5|$|Dickinson {{was born}} in Amherst, Massachusetts. Although part of a {{prominent}} family with strong ties to its community, Dickinson lived much {{of her life in}} reclusive isolation. After studying at the Amherst Academy for seven years in her youth, she briefly attended the Mount Holyoke Female Seminary before returning to her family's house in Amherst. Considered <b>an</b> <b>eccentric</b> by locals, she developed a noted penchant for white clothing and became known for her reluctance to greet guests or, later in life, to even leave her bedroom. Dickinson never married, and most friendships between her and others depended entirely upon correspondence. Dickinson was a recluse for the later years of her life.|$|E

5|$|Gliese 581d orbits Gliese 581 at 0.21847 AU, {{approximately}} {{a fifth of}} the distance that the Earth orbits the Sun, though its orbital eccentricity has not been confirmed. There are currently two models for its orbit, a circular one like Earth's, and <b>an</b> <b>eccentric</b> one like Mercury's. These are based on the four planet and six planet model for the Gliese 581 system, respectively. Under the four planet model Gliese 581d would most probably be in a spin-orbit resonance of 2:1, rotating twice for each orbit of its parent star. Therefore, the day on Gliese 581d should approximately be 67 Earth days long.|$|E
5|$|Grandon Productions {{produced}} Donen's next film: The Grass Is Greener, released through Universal Pictures in 1960. Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr {{play the}} earl and countess {{of a large}} estate in England who are forced to permit guided tours of their mansion {{in order to help}} their financial problems. Robert Mitchum plays an American oil tycoon who falls in love with Kerr and Jean Simmons plays <b>an</b> <b>eccentric</b> American heiress who is Grant's former girlfriend. The film was a financial disappointment in the US, but successful in England where the original stage version had been a West End hit.|$|E
5|$|HD 154672 b is {{a closely}} {{orbiting}} planet that {{is larger than}} Jupiter. Its mass was estimated as 5.02 that of Jupiter. HD 154672 b also orbits its host star {{at a distance of}} 0.6 AU every 163.91 days. Earth, in comparison, orbits the Sun at a distance of 1 AU every 365.25 days. However, HD 154672 b has an orbital eccentricity of 0.61, which indicates a very elliptical orbit. Because HD 154672 b has such <b>an</b> <b>eccentric</b> orbit, the equilibrium temperature of the planet varies between 300 K and 600 K, which is significantly higher than that of Jupiter (124 K). If liquid water is present in the atmosphere of HD 154672 b, it could possibly convert between gaseous and liquid phases as the planet moves along its orbit.|$|E
