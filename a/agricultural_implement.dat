2500|$|Noting {{the growing}} union support, {{an article in}} the progressive-leaning Mother Jones {{magazine}} said that union support could splinter and derail the protests rather than sustain them because while unions are tightly organized, hierarchical, and run with a clear chain of command, Occupy Wall Street is the opposite in that they are [...] "a horizontal, autonomous, leaderless, modified-consensus-based system with roots in anarchist thought." [...] However, the article went on to suggest that if the unions and OWS joined together they could work to create a progressive movement that [...] "effectively taps into the rising feeling among many Americans that economic opportunity has been squashed by corporate greed and the influence of the very rich in politics." [...] As the success of the movement has become apparent, union organizers have begun to embrace some of their social media skills, bold tactics, and the simplicity of the 99% slogan. Damon Silvers, the AFL–CIO's policy director, said, “We think the Occupy movement has given voice to something very basic about what’s going on in our country right now. The fact that they’ve figured out certain concepts and language for doing that, we think is really important and positive.” The International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Implement</b> Workers of America (UAW) has endorsed the movement saying, [...] "We recognize the need to work together and learn from each other.
