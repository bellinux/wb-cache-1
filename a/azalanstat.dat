40|$|In vitro {{studies on}} mouse oocytes {{have shown that}} two close-ly related sterols, {{subsequently}} named meiosis-activating sterols (MAS), can overcome the inhibitory effect of hypoxanthine on the resumption of meiosis. These sterols are synthesized by cy-tochrome P 450 lanosterol 14 a-demethylase (LDM), a key enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. We have used specific inhibitors of LDM, <b>azalanstat</b> (RS- 21607) and RS- 21745, to test whether MAS is an obligatory mediator in the resumption of meiosis in the rat. Addition of <b>azalanstat</b> and RS- 21745 (1 – 200 mM) to culture medium of rat isolated cumulus-enclosed oocyte and preovula-tory follicle-enclosed oocyte stimulated by LH/hCG did not al-low separation between their inhibition of the resumption of meiosis and the degeneration of oocytes. In both models, doses of the drug that inhibited oocyte maturation also increased oo...|$|E
