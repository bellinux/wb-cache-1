5|$|The {{first real}} {{progress}} toward a modern understanding of nervous function, though, came from the investigations of Luigi Galvani, who discovered that <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> static electricity applied to an exposed nerve of a dead frog could cause its leg to contract. Since that time, each major advance in understanding has followed more or less directly from {{the development of a}} new technique of investigation. Until the early years of the 20th century, the most important advances were derived from new methods for staining cells. Particularly critical was the invention of the Golgi stain, which (when correctly used) stains only a small fraction of neurons, but stains them in their entirety, including cell body, dendrites, and axon. Without such a stain, brain tissue under a microscope appears as an impenetrable tangle of protoplasmic fibers, in which it is impossible to determine any structure. In the hands of Camillo Golgi, and especially of the Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal, the new stain revealed hundreds of distinct types of neurons, each with its own unique dendritic structure and pattern of connectivity.|$|E

25|$|A {{detonation}} wave follows slightly different rules from an ordinary shock {{since it is}} driven by the chemical reaction occurring behind the shock wavefront. In the simplest theory for detonations, an unsupported, self-propagating {{detonation wave}} proceeds at the Chapman-Jouguet flow velocity. A detonation will also cause <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> type 1, above to propagate into the surrounding air due to the overpressure induced by the explosion.|$|E

When he returns, Marge tells him their marriage {{is in serious}} trouble if he values fishing more than her. To prove his love for her, he lets the fish (still alive) go and they return home. Once home, Marge congratulates Grampa on how clean the house is, to which he reveals his secret is [...] "pretending to cry". Grampa laughs as he reveals to a shocked Bart and Lisa that he tricked them as he leaves, and Bart swears he will never trust an old person again. At the bait shop, General Sherman is still uncaught, but tales are told of a near-mythical figure who almost succeeded: [...] "Went {{by the name of}} Homer.

500|$|The video {{begins with}} Gaga slowly {{appearing}} {{from behind a}} building on a deserted street corner. The whole scenario is bathed in red and violet lights, coming from {{the windows of the}} buildings and alleyways as steam billows out from the drains. When the first verse of the song begins, Gaga emerges from the window of an apartment onto the fire escape. A long take follows, of Gaga strutting through the red-lit district singing the line [...] "I got a reason that you should take me home tonight", and <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> black hair falls in her eyes. Gaga does not remove it and the shot spans to her walking backside, gesturing the viewer to follow. The video consists mostly of interchanging shots of Gaga dancing and singing on the street, on the fire escape, and on the steps in front of the apartment building with Clemons. Near the end of the video, after Clemons' saxophone solo, Gaga crouches in front of the building's steps and kisses the sidewalk. The video concludes with a close-up of Gaga's face, before she re-enters through the window into her smokey apartment.|$|E

500|$|Another {{prominent}} {{artist was}} Tetsuya Nomura. Having impressed Sakaguchi with his proposed ideas, which were handwritten and illustrated {{rather than simply}} typed on a PC, Nomura was brought on as main character designer. Talking of his role as character designer, Nomura stated {{that when he was}} brought on, the main scenario had not been completed, but he [...] "went along like, 'I guess first off you need a hero and a heroine', and from there drew the designs while thinking up details about the characters. After [...] done the hero and heroine, [...] carried on drawing by thinking what kind of characters would be interesting to have. When [...] handed over the designs [...] tell people the character details [...] thought up, or write them down on a separate sheet of paper". Something that could not be carried over from earlier titles was the chibi sprite art, as that would not fit with the new graphical direction. Naora, in his role as an assistant character designer and art director, helped adjust each character's appearance so the actions they performed were believable. When designing Cloud and Sephiroth, Nomura was influenced by his view of their rivalry mirroring the legendary animosity between Miyamoto Musashi and Sasaki Kojirō, with Cloud and Sephiroth being Musashi and Kojirō respectively. Sephiroth's look was defined as [...] "kakkoii", a Japanese term combining good looks with coolness. Several of Nomura's designs evolved substantially during development. Cloud's original design of slicked-back black hair with no spikes was intended to serve as a contrast to Sephiroth's long, flowing silver hair in addition to saving polygons. Nomura feared, however, that such masculinity could prove unpopular with fans, and therefore he changed Cloud's design to feature <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> spiky, bright blond hair. Vincent changed from researcher to detective to chemist, and finally to the figure of a former Turk with a tragic past.|$|E

He had <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> dark red hair and piercing blue eyes like those of his famous cousin, Thomas Jackson. William Jackson was not known as an eloquent speaker, but he was known as a forceful one. He later became the Commonwealth's Attorney for Harrison County.
