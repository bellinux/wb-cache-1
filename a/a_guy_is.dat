Regarding its style, Stan confessed, [...] "I want to release what I like {{and not to}} follow the trend and speed up the {{creation}} process just because {{something needs to be}} released. [...] is a mixture of [...] styles. I would say it is a more '90s track but with a contemporary feel". On another occasion, the singer described the single as an [...] "old kind of style, but a new style. It's like eurodance." [...] According to her, the lyrical message is [...] " [...] of expressing the girls' need to be loved [...] and sometimes you just need to tell to the guy, 'tell me that you love me'". Jonathan Currinn from CelebMix noted, [...] "As for the meaning behind the song, the lyrics suggest a relationship where <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>is</b> always breaking her heart even though she knows that he actually cares for her. Such a deep emotional message behind this infectious tune." ...|$|E
