40|$|This is {{an inquiry}} into the tools {{developed}} by the early Germanic aristocracy to solidify, extend and maintain their leadership roles and hence their right to rule. It applied to the individual warlord as leader of his band of followers {{as well as to}} the collectivity of warlords within a tribe who were represented in the institution of the council of leading men. During this time Germanic peoples were exposed to the cultural influences and political policies of the Roman Empire which greatly furthered the transformation of tribal societies into formal states when warlords became kings and free warriors were bound in patronage. Nevertheless, throughout the turmoil of migration and change, Germanic leadership held on to their native legitimacy originally endorsed and validated by an oath of allegiance on part of their followers. When some Germanic peoples settled on Roman soil individual leaders fought to maintain viable communities eventually transforming them into political entities. In doing so, they added to their Germanic right to rule imperial criteria of legitimization that was designed to enhance their status, <b>acceptance,</b> <b>authority</b> and power in the Romans' perception whom they eventually ruled as kings. This study follows Germanic aristocracy through the transformation of their societies and exposes the many means deployed to maintain themselves as leaders and hence uphold their legitimacy...|$|E

40|$|Scholars {{have long}} speculated about education’s {{political}} impacts, variously {{arguing that it}} promotes modern or pro-democratic attitudes; that it instills acceptance of existing authority; and that it empowers the disadvantaged to challenge authority. To avoid endogeneity bias, if schooling requires some willingness to accept authority, we assess {{the political and social}} impacts of a randomized girls’ merit scholarship incentive program in Kenya that raised test scores and secondary schooling. We find little evidence for modernization theory. Consistent with the empowerment view, young women in program schools were less likely to accept domestic violence. Moreover, the program increased objective political knowledge, and reduced <b>acceptance</b> of political <b>authority.</b> However, this rejection of the status quo did not translate into greater perceived political efficacy, community participation, or voting intentions. Instead, the perceived legitimacy of political violence increased. Reverse causality may help account for the view that education instills greater <b>acceptance</b> of <b>authority.</b> ...|$|R
