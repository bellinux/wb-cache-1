40|$|Sex steroid hormones such as estrogens and androgens are {{involved}} in the development and differentiation of the breast tissue. The activity and concentration of sex steroids is determined by the availability from the circulation, and on local conversion. This conversion is primarily mediated by aromatase, steroid sulfatase, and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases. In postmenopausal women, this is the primary source of estrogens in the breast. Up to 70 - 80 % of all breast cancers express the estrogen receptor-a, responsible for promoting the growth of the tissue. Further, 60 - 80 % express the androgen receptor, which has been shown to have tissue protective effects in estrogen receptor positive breast cancer, and a more ambiguous response in estrogen receptor negative breast cancers. In this review, we summarize the function and clinical relevance in cancer for 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases 1, which facilitates the reduction of estrone to estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone to <b>androstendiol</b> and dihydrotestosterone to 3 alpha- and 3 beta-diol as well as 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases 2 which mediates the oxidation of estradiol to estrone, testosterone to androstenedione and <b>androstendiol</b> to dehydroepiandrosterone. The expression of 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases 1 and 2 alone and in combination has been shown to predict patient outcome, and inhibition of 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases 1 has been proposed to be a prime candidate for inhibition in patients who develop aromatase inhibitor resistance or in combination with aromatase inhibitors as a first line treatment. Here we review the status of inhibitors against 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases 1. In addition, we review the involvement of 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases 4, 5, 7, and 14 in breast cancer. Funding Agencies|Swedish Cancer Society [150349]</p...|$|E
40|$|Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a C- 19 adrenal steroid and {{the most}} {{abundant}} circulating hormone in humans. Since circulating levels decline in late adulthood, treatment of humans with DHEA has been suggested to have beneficial health effects. Although the mechanism of action is unknown, DHEA may be metabolized to active metabolites that exert their physiological effects by receptor-mediated processes and cell signaling pathways. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the mechanistic processes of DHEA action. Since DHEA may exert its pleotropic effects by being metabolized to biologically active species, a GC/MS method was developed to quantify the liver microsomal metabolism of DHEA of various species and identify the P 450 enzymes responsible for metabolism. 16 alpha-hydroxy-DHEA and 7 alpha-hydroxy-DHEA were formed in rat, hamster, pig and human. CYP 3 A 4 and CYP 3 A 5 formed 7 alpha-hydroxy-DHEA, 16 alpha-hydroxy-DHEA, and the unique human metabolite, 7 beta-hydroxy-DHEA, while the fetal enzyme CYP 3 A 7 formed only 16 alpha-hydroxy and 7 beta-hydroxy-DHEA. By using this method to examine the metabolite profiles of various P 450 s, the developmental expression patterns of the human cytochrome P 4503 A forms could be classified and therefore have significant clinical relevance. Nuclear receptors transduce the effects of hormones into transcriptional responses. DHEA and metabolites were screened in a cell-based assay to determine the interaction with estrogen receptors alpha and beta (ERalpha and ERbeta). DHEA, DHEA-S, and <b>androstendiol</b> activated ERalpha, while DHEA, 7 -oxo-DHEA, androstenedione and androstenediol activated ERbeta demonstrating ER is activated directly by DHEA and some metabolites. These and other studies from our laboratory demonstrate that DHEA is metabolized into various monohydroxylated metabolites. DHEA and metabolites directly activate ER as well as the pregnane X receptor (PXR). Additionally, DHEA has been shown to activate another nuclear receptor, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) 2 ̆ 2 in vivo. 2 ̆ 2 This research suggests that DHEA action is mediated by multiple receptors and metabolites with various biological activities, comprising of a complex mode of action of DHEA...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the first}} case report in Oman and the Gulf region of a 17 -β-hydroxysteroid {{dehydrogenase}} type 3 (17 -β-HSD 3) deficiency with a novel mutation in the HSD 17 B 3 gene {{that has not been}} previously described in the medical literature. An Omani child was diagnosed with 17 -β-HSD 3 deficiency and was followed up for 11 years at the Pediatric Endocrinology Clinic, Royal Hospital, Oman. He presented at the age of six weeks with ambiguous genitalia, stretched penile and bilateral undescended testes. Ultrasound showed no evidence of any uterine or ovarian structures with oval shaped solid structures in both inguinal regions that were confirmed by histology to be testicular tissues with immature seminiferous tubules only. The diagnosis was made by demonstrating low serum testosterone and high androstenedione, estrone, and androstenedione:testosterone ratio. Karyotyping confirmed 46,XY and the infant was raised as male. Testosterone injections (25 mg once monthly) were given at two and six months and then three months before his surgeries at five and seven years of age when he underwent multiple operations for orchidopexy and hypospadias correction. At the age of 10 years he developed bilateral gynecomastia (stage 4). Laboratory investigations showed raised follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, androstenedione, and estrone with low-normal testosterone and low <b>androstendiol</b> glucurunide. Testosterone injections (50 mg once monthly for six months) were given that resulted in significant reduction in his gynecomastia. Molecular analysis revealed a previously unreported homozygous variant in exon eight of the HSD 17 B 3 gene (NM_ 000197. 1 :c. 576 G>A. Trp 192 *). This variant creates a premature stop codon, which is very likely to result in a truncated protein or loss of protein production. This {{is the first}} report in the medical literature of this novel HSD 17 B 3 gene mutation. A literature review was conducted to identify the previous studies related to this disorder...|$|E
