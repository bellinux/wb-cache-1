500|$|Miami Vice {{received}} particular criticism at {{the difficulty}} of manoeuvring the car. Edward Drury of Computer Gamer, though finding the game to be enjoyable at times, stated that his only dislike was the manoeuvrability of the car, remarking that the game [...] "gets boring" [...] due {{to the amount of}} collisions. Bourne was highly critical of the mechanics of the car, finding it to be [...] "ludicrous" [...] and taking [...] "at least half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> used to". He concluded that the game was [...] "very bad". Jim Lloyd of Computer and Video Games and a reviewer of Zzap!64 concurred that the controlling the car was a major issue.|$|E
500|$|Angelou {{describes}} her writing process as regimented. [...] Beginning with Caged Bird, she {{has used the}} same [...] "writing ritual" [...] for many years. She gets up at {{five in the morning}} and checks into a hotel room, where the staff has been instructed to remove any pictures from the walls. [...] She writes on legal pads while lying on the bed, with a bottle of sherry, a deck of cards to play solitaire, Roget's Thesaurus, and the Bible, and leaves by the early afternoon. [...] She averages 10–12 pages of material a day, which she edits down to three or four pages in the evening. [...] Angelou goes through this process to [...] "enchant" [...] herself, and as she said in a 1989 interview with the BBC, to [...] "relive the agony, the anguish, the Sturm und Drang". She places herself back in the time she is writing about, even during traumatic experiences like her rape in Caged Bird, to [...] "tell the human truth" [...] about her life. [...] Angelou has stated that she plays cards to reach that place of enchantment, to access her memories more effectively. She has stated, [...] "It may take <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into it, but once I'm in it—ha! It's so delicious!"

2500|$|In January 1800 Galatea escorted {{a convoy}} from Cork through the Channel to the Downs. On a stormy night, Lieutenant Donald Campbell and six men took a boat to take {{possession}} of a Spanish letter of marque that Galatea had caught. Because of the weather it took them <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to her and then as they boarded her waves stove in their boat. Still, the seven men took control of Pensée and her 20-man crew. However, {{for the next ten}} days the weather blocked Campbell from contact with Galatea. Campbell therefore had to navigate Pensée while keeping control of a group of prisoners that outnumbered his men by almost three to one. This feat and his good service record led to Lieutenant Campbell being promoted to first lieutenant of [...] in 1802 or 1803.|$|E
2500|$|The sirens {{had started}} {{sounding}} in Dresden at 21:51 (CET). Frederick Taylor {{writes that the}} Germans could see that a large enemy bomber formation—or what they called [...] "ein dicker Hund" [...] (lit: a fat dog, a [...] "major thing")—was approaching somewhere in the east. At 21:39, the Reich Air Defence Leadership issued an enemy aircraft warning for Dresden, although, at that point, it was thought Leipzig might be the target. At 21:59, the Local Air Raid Leadership confirmed that the bombers were {{in the area of}} Dresden-Pirna. Taylor writes the city was largely undefended; a night fighter force of ten Messerschmitt 110s at Klotzsche airfield was scrambled, but it took them half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into an attack position. At 22:03, the Local Air Raid Leadership issued the first definitive warning: [...] "Warning! Warning! Warning!

50|$|Atlanta {{is notable}} {{for being the}} 25th city with the most homes without cars and has a fair use of public {{transportation}} with 14.85% of workers using public transportation, while 12.7% of self-driving commuters spend more than <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> work.|$|R
50|$|Chamberlain {{is notable}} {{for being the}} last town between Regina and Saskatoon that Highway 11, the Louis Riel Trail, still passes through. The highway narrows to two lanes and its speed limit is reduced from 110 km/h to 50 km/h. A number of small {{restaurants}} and gas stations benefit from having traffic pass through at slow speed. The town is only about half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> drive from Moose Jaw, <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> away from Regina and one and <b>a</b> half <b>hours</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Saskatoon.

2500|$|The {{station was}} opened by the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway on 31 March 1841 as the {{terminus}} of its line from Bridge Street railway station, {{which had a}} shared section between Glasgow, and Paisley Gilmour Street being run by the Glasgow and Paisley Joint Railway. Greenock was already a major seaport and a branch near the station provided a goods service, {{but it was the}} passenger service which proved a major success. Clyde steamers took a couple of hours to get from Glasgow down the River Clyde as far as Greenock, and {{now for the first time}} a railway took only <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to the coast. The terminus with its short driveway sloping down to Cathcart Street was around 300 yards (280 m) from Custom House Quay, Greenock, where steamers took wealthy commuters in summer to their villas around the shores of the Firth of Clyde as well as huge numbers of holidaymakers visiting resorts down the firth at [...] "trades holidays", particularly the annual Glasgow Fair.|$|E

Matlock is very useful once the player reaches the lab section. She can synthesize health kits and antidotes from herbs with the proper equipment.

60|$|The {{distance}} to Pekki, the last Bekwai village, was fifteen miles.
