Some <b>alkanols,</b> especially when taken at low concentration, have been found to stimulate the activity of the Ca pump and Ca-ATPase, namely tert-butanol, isopropanol and ethanol (from the group of hydrophilic <b>alkanols),</b> and pentanol, isopentanol and hexanol (from the more hydrophobic <b>alkanols).</b> Methanol (from the first group) and isobutanol, butanol and propanol (from the second) do not stimulate the Ca pump compared with the control. The specific effect of different <b>alkanols</b> cannot be explained in terms of a unitary mechanism based on ‘fluidity’ changes of the membrane. It is assumed that, at low concentrations, certain <b>alkanols</b> (or groups of related <b>alkanols)</b> are able to promote the specific transition of membrane proteins into the active state, whereas at higher concentrations all <b>alkanols</b> provide for the non-functional state of the proteins...|$|R

Results of the GT + non-polar Perturbed Chain (PC) SAFT equation of state were compared to predictions of GT combined with the PC-polar-SAFT, i. e. PCP-SAFT, equation. Both GT + PC-SAFT and GT + PCP-SAFT give reasonable prediction of the surface tension for pure <b>alkanols.</b> Results of both models are comparable as {{no significant difference in the}} modeled saturation properties and in the predicted surface tension using GT was found.

50|$|However, cutoff {{effect can}} still be {{explained}} {{in the frame of}} lipid hypothesis. In short-chain <b>alkanols</b> (A) segments of the chain are rather rigid (in terms of conformational enthropy) and very close to hydroxyl group tethered to aqueous interfacial region ("buoy"). Consequently, these segments efficiently redistribute lateral stresses from the bilayer interior toward the interface. In long-chain <b>alkanols</b> (B) hydrocarbon chain segments are located further from hydroxyl group and are more flexible than in short-chain <b>alkanols.</b> Efficiency of pressure redistribution decreases as the length of hydrocarbon chain increases until anaesthetic potency is lost at some point. It was proposed that polyalkanols (C) will have anaesthetic effect similar to short-chain 1-alkanols if the chain length between two neighbouring hydroxyl groups is smaller than the cutoff. This idea was supported by the experimental evidence because polyhydroxyalkanes 1,6,11,16-hexadecanetetraol and 2,7,12,17-octadecanetetraol exhibited significant anaesthetic potency as was originally proposed.|$|R

40|$|The aqueous {{solution}} {{behavior of a}} PEO-PPO-PEO block copolymer (EO 103 PO 39 EO 103), was investigated {{in the presence of}} aliphatic alkanols (C 2, C 4, C 6 and C 8). The non-associated polymer chains remain extremely hydrated in water, but aggregation in the form of spherical micelles was evidenced, triggered by the interaction of polymer chains with hydrophobic <b>alkanol.</b> We assume that the hydrophobic interaction between the PPO block of the copolymer and <b>alkanol</b> promotes micellization, which increases further with the introduction of higher chain length species. The critical micellization temperature (CMT), as measured by UV-visible spectroscopy, indicates an interaction of polymer chains with the <b>alkanol</b> bearing a higher chain length, which triggers aggregation. The micelles were characterized by small angle neutron scattering to elucidate the size and related micellar parameters. The gradual increase in the <b>alkanol</b> content increases the aggregation number, though the micelles were spherical in shape. We conclude that ethanol, due to its preferential solubility in the aqueous phase, does not affect the aggregation. The alkanols with chain lengths of C 4 -C 8 chain, interact with the PPO block through hydrophobic interaction and shifts the CMTs to lower values.

40|$|The {{effect of}} heptanol, an <b>alkanol</b> which {{decreases}} gap junctional permeability, {{was investigated in}} the perfused rat pancreas. Under basal conditions, heptanol (3. 5 mM) caused a three- to fourfold increase of pancreatic juice, protein, and amylase outputs. The effect on enzyme secretion was fully reversible upon removal of the <b>alkanol</b> and was not secondary {{to the release of}} acetylcholine from nerve endings, since it was not prevented by addition of atropine (10 - 6 M) to the perfusate. By contrast, another <b>alkanol,</b> hexanol (3 mM), which does not decrease coupling between acinar cells in spite of anesthetic properties analogous to those of heptanol, did not alter pancreatic secretion. The effect of heptanol was not mediated by a significant stimulation of cyclic AMP, nor did the <b>alkanol</b> increase the secretion of lactic dehydrogenase, a cytosolic marker. Analysis of the numerical density of freeze-fractured and immunolabeled gap junctions between acinar cells did not show differences between heptanol-perfused and control pancreases. In addition, heptanol did not alter carbachol (10 - 6 M and 10 - 5 M) -evoked amylase release. Since heptanol blocks cell coupling, apparently without interfering with the main intracellular pathways triggering enzyme release, we suggest that downregulation of direct cell-to-cell communications increases pancreatic exocrine secretion. Thus, cell coupling is probably involved in the regulation of the secretory activity of acinar cells. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{physicochemical}} {{effects of}} a series of <b>alkanols,</b> alkanediols and glycerol on erythrocyte shape and hemolysis at 4 and 20 °C were examined. We calculated the dielectric constant of the incubation medium, Ds, and the dielectric constant of the erythrocyte membrane Dm in the presence of organic solutes. The ratio DsDm = − 38. 48 at 20 °C defines the normal biconcave shape in a medium without hemolytic agents. A decrease in DsDm favors externalization or internalization with consequent hemolysis. <b>Alkanols</b> and alkanediols convert biconcave erythrocytes into echinocytes, which is accompanied by an increase in the projected surface area. Glycerol converts biconcave erythrocytes into stomatocytes, which was accompanied by a marginal decrease in the projected surface area. Progressive externalization in <b>alkanols</b> and alkanediols or internalization in glycerol resulted in a decrease in the projected surface area and the formation of smooth spheres. The degree of shape change induced was related to the degree of hemolysis and the ratio DsDm. A decrease in temperature reduced both the degree of shape change and hemolysis. Our results suggest that physicochemical toxicity may be a result of a temperature dependent hydrophobic interaction between the organic solutes and the membrane and is best interpreted by the ability of the solutes to change Ds and Dm. These results are discussed with respect to the physicochemical constants of the organic solutes...|$|R

40|$|AbstractExceptions to the Meyer-Overton rule are {{commonly}} cited as evidence against indirect, membrane-mediated mechanisms of general anesthesia. However, another interpretation is possible {{within the context}} of an indirect mechanism in which solubilization of an anesthetic in the membrane causes a redistribution of lateral pressures in the membrane, which in turn shifts the conformational equilibrium of membrane proteins such as ligand-gated ion channels. It is suggested that compounds of different stiffness and interfacial activity have different intrinsic potencies, i. e., they cause widely different redistributions of the pressure profile (and thus different effects on protein conformational equilibria) per unit concentration of the compound in the membrane. Calculations incorporating the greater stiffness of perfluoromethylenic chains and the large interfacial attraction of hydroxyl groups predict the higher intrinsic potency of short <b>alkanols</b> than alkanes, the cutoffs in potency of alkanes and <b>alkanols</b> and the much shorter cutoffs for their perfluorinated analogues. Both effects, increased stiffness and interfacial activity, are present in unsaturated hydrocarbon solutes, and the intrinsic potencies are predicted to depend on the magnitude of both effects and on the number and locations of multiple bonds within the molecule. Most importantly, the intrinsic potencies of polymeric <b>alkanols</b> with regularly spaced hydroxyl groups are predicted to rise with increasing chain length, without cutoff; such molecules should serve to distinguish unambiguously between indirect mechanisms and direct binding mechanisms of anesthesia...|$|R

40|$|Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanols (1 -CNH 2 N+ 1 OH) {{with varying}} carbon-chain lengths (N = 10 - 30) have been {{systematically}} studied {{by means of}} scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) at the interfaces between <b>alkanol</b> solutions (or liquids) and Au(111) surfaces. The carbon skeletons were found to lie flat on the surfaces. This orientation is consistent with SAMs of alkanols on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and MoS 2 surfaces, and also with alkanes on reconstructed Au(111) surfaces. This result differs from a prior report, which claimed that 1 -decanol molecules (N = 10) stood on their ends with the OH polar groups facing the gold substrate. Compared to alkanes, the re-placement of one terminal CH 3 group with an OH group introduces new bonding features for alkanols owing to the feasibility of forming hydrogen bonds. While SAMs of long-chain alkanols (N > 18) resemble those of alkanes, in which the aliphatic chains make a greater contribution, hydrogen bonding plays a more {{important role in the}} formation of SAMs of short-chain alkanols. Thus, in addition to the titled lamellar structure, a herringbone-like structure, seldom seen in SAMs of alkanes, is dominant in <b>alkanol</b> SAMs for values of N < 18. The odd-even effect present in alkane SAMs is also present in <b>alkanol</b> SAMs. Thus, the odd N alkanols (alkanols with an odd number of carbon atoms) adopt perpendicular lamellar structures owing to the favorable interactions of the CH 3 terminal groups, similar to the result observed for odd alkanes. In contrast to alkanes on Au(III) surfaces, for which no SAMs on an unreconstructed gold substrate were observed, alkanols are capable of forming SAMs on either the reconstructed or the unreconstructed gold surfaces. Structural models for the packing of <b>alkanol</b> molecules on Au(111) surfaces have been proposed, which successfully explain these experimental observations...|$|E

This induces some significant structural changes and notably the formation of small unilamellar vesicles, nanometer scaled vesicles, L(sv). These structural changes have been measured and quantified using small angle neutron scattering, SANS. At a solution concentration of 25 mM, the DHDAB/C(12) E(12) mixtures have a structural evolution, from C(12) E(12) rich to DHDAB rich solution compositions, of small globular micelles, L(1), to micellar/vesicle coexistence, L(1) /L(v) or L(v) /L(1), to vesicle structures, L(v), bilamellar or multilamellar vesicles, blv or mlv. The impact of the {{addition of}} straight chain <b>alkanols</b> (in the range octanol to hexadecanol) depends upon the alkyl chain length and the amount of alcohol added. Furthermore, the effect of the addition of octanol and decanol appears to be distinctly {{different from that of the}} larger straight chain <b>alkanols</b> of dodecanol and hexadecanol. For the addition of octanol and decanol to C(12) E(12) rich DHDAB/C(12) E(12) mixtures, the alcohol is solubilized into the micellar core, and as the amount of alcohol added increases, significant micellar growth is ultimately observed. However, notably at intermediate DHDAB/C(12) E(12) solution compositions, in the region of L(1) /L(v) or L(v) /L(1) coexistance in the absence of alcohol, the addition of octanol or decanol promotes the formation of relatively small unilamellar vesicles, L(sv), nanometer sized vesicles, with a mean diameter in the range 70 - 140 A. For solutions that are rich in DHDAB, the addition of octanol or decanol results in a transition to L(v) /L(sv) coexistence and ultimately to L(v) formation. In contrast, the addition of the larger straight chain length <b>alkanols,</b> dodecanol or hexadecanol, to DHDAB/C(12) E(12) mixtures results in a somewhat different behavior. In this case, the addition of dodecanol or hexadecanol results in the transition from L(1) to L(1) /L(v) to L(v) occurring for solutions less rich in DHDAB than is observed in the absence of alcohol. That is, there is an enhanced tendency toward the formation of structures with a lower net curvature, either blv or mlv.
