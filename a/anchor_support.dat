30|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, the prestress of rock bolts {{is one of}} the key {{parameters for}} bolting, and plays a decisive role on the effect of <b>anchor</b> <b>support.</b> The previous studies show that the anchor prestress should reach a level of 30  %– 50  % of anchor yield strength. According to the conversion relationship, the bolts’ tightening torque should be 300 – 500  N m. To reach such a high prestress, the existing single bolting machines in China cannot meet such a requirement. It is necessary to develop a suitable bolt tightening tool to significantly increase the anchor cable’s prestress.|$|E

40|$|Yachts {{are built}} to provide guests {{with a unique}} experience. In order to provide this experience, yachts are often {{anchored}} at special locations. Captains prefer to use a single bow anchor when they moor the vessel. Problems are reported {{with respect to the}} availability while yachts are at anchor. These are caused by environmental forces. Availability is the yachting term for the operability of a yacht. The comfort on board and the availability of activities are the main aspects playing a role in the overall availability. Horizontal motions and accelerations of the vessel, respectively caused by wind and waves, are the main issues at anchor. These undesired accelerations can be reduced by controlling the yacht’s heading, ensuring optimal wave interaction. The objective of this research is to improve the availability while at anchor by suppressing the horizontal motions and controlling the heading of the vessel. Previous research suggests that using thrusters is a feasible solution for this. The research performed in this thesis provides a design proposition based on a quasi static analysis. For that reason, mathematical models are developed which are embedded in engineering tools. When these tools are defined, the first step is a parameter study. This has been performed to examine what, theoretically, is the preferred <b>anchor</b> <b>support</b> system. In this study, the required power and mooring force is calculated for a predefined capability. The capability is the environmental condition at which the system is able to be stationary. Based on the results can be concluded that the mooring line has to be located close to the pivot point of the vessel and that the thrusters have to be located with a large distance to the pivot point opposite to the mooring line location. Using multiple thrusters is often preferable because the same thrust can be delivered with less power. However, the thruster located the closest to the mooring line and pivot point delivers little thrust compared to the other thruster located further away. The usage of a tunnel thruster or an azimuth thruster is preferred. The difference between these two is limited because the azimuth thruster operates at an angle θ of 90 degrees. The theoretical solutions found neglect practical aspects which have {{to be taken into account}} for implementation; e. g. the layout of the vessel and the range of the required headings. To consider these aspects, multiple assessment criteria have been defined. The design study has been performed with various design cases. The capability of these cases has been calculated with the developed model in terms of wind speed. When the used power is reduced, the comfort with respect to noise is increased. However, this reduces the capability as well because less thrust can be delivered. The reduction of the capability is related to the power margin to the power 1 / 3, when the thrusters are operating at maximum allowable power. For each design case, the dynamic positioning capability has been calculated to investigate whether including a mooring line influences the capability. As a result of this research can be concluded that the capability of the <b>anchor</b> <b>support</b> systems is higher than the capability of the DP systems and that the <b>anchor</b> <b>support</b> system requires less power to do so. The DP system uses twice as much power for the required range of headings. The design proposition is determined based on the results of the quasi static calculations supported by a multi-criteria analysis. The preferred <b>anchor</b> <b>support</b> system for a yacht has an azimuth stern thruster in front of the platforms at the stern. Placing a thruster below these platforms causes safety issues and reduces the comfort. The yacht is equipped with an azimuth thruster in the bow because such a thruster can provide the same amount of thrust with less power and provides better controllability. The mooring line location is situated in the bow and is located on the centreline, thus an underwater anchor is required. The used approach and developed tools are provided to Feadship which allow them to consider the capability of <b>anchor</b> <b>support</b> system in the early design phase of the new yachts. This gives Feadship the opportunity to build yachts with a higher availability at anchor. As a result, the guests will be able to enjoy an even more unique experience due to the control of horizontal motions. Confidential thesis - Abstract only.

Examples of potential high-yield science areas on Mars include young gullies on sloped terrains, exposed layers of bedrock in the Victoria Crater, sources of methane gas near Martian volcanic ranges, and stepped delta formations in heavily cratered regions. In addition, a recently discovered cryovolcano on Titan and frozen water near the south pole of our own Moon could provide a wealth of knowledge to any robotic explorer capable of accessing these regions.

The results indicate that the underground powerhouse of Jinping I hydropower station is characterized by high to extremely high geo-stresses during rock excavation. Excessive surrounding rock mass deformation and high stress of anchorage structures, surrounding rock mass unloading damage, and local cracking failure of surrounding rock masses, etc., are mainly caused by rock mass excavation. Deformations of surrounding rock masses and stresses in anchorage structures here are larger than those found elsewhere: 20 % of extensometers in the main powerhouse record more than 50  mm with the maximum at around 250  mm observed in the downstream sidewall of the transformer hall. There are about 25 % of the anchor bolts having recorded stresses of more than 200  MPa.

40|$|The {{emerging}} {{standards for}} the next-generation wireless communication system demand for multi-band RF front-ends. Reconfigurable RF devices based on MEMS technology have emerged {{with the potential to}} significantly reduce the system complexity and cost. Robust operation of RF MEMS tuners under the non-ideal effects due to fabrication uncertainties and environmental variations is critical in achieving reliable RF MEMS reconfigurable devices. Therefore, it is essential to model and characterize these non-ideal effects, and further to alleviate these non-ideal effects by design optimization. ^ In this dissertation, the effects of non-perfect <b>anchor</b> <b>support,</b> residual stress, and temperature sensibility of MEMS tuners have been studied. The anchor supports of MEMS beams, which are widely used as tunable components, are often far from the ideally assumed built-in or step-up conditions. An equation-based nonlinear model for inclined supports in non-flat fixed-fixed beams has been developed and validated by experimental results. Residual stress developed during the fabrication presents the major challenges in developing reliable MEMS tuners. An efficient extraction method for in-plane residual stress has been proposed using a single beam test structure. This method has been demonstrated by wafer-scale measurements of electrostatically actuated beams. The statistic and spatial distribution of extracted residual stresses on a quarter wafer is presented, and the accuracy of this method is evaluated by uncertainty analysis. With the awareness the residual stress effects, the design optimization has been conducted for designing stress-tolerant micro-corrugated diaphragm tuners used in tunable cavity resonators/filters. Furthermore, the temperature sensitivity issue results from the mismatch of material properties between the structure material and substrate has been discussed and a thermally-stable RF MEMS tuner based on a nonuniform micro corrugated diaphragm has been proposed and experimentally validated over a wide temperature variation. ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} was to review and evaluate the current literature on skeletal bone anchorage in orthodontics with regard to success rates of the various systems. Materials and Methods: MEDLINE, PubMed, and Cochrane searches (period January 1966 to January 2006, English language) of animal and human studies using skeletal anchorage during orthodontic treatment were scrutinized. A total of 50 relevant articles were identified which investigated various types of implants. Results: Two types of anchorage systems are used in orthodontics: (1) osseointegrated dental implants, including temporary mid-palatal implants. These systems were associated {{with a wide variety}} of success rates in animal studies. In human studies, the systems were shown to be reliable, with success rates between 85 % and 100 % (ie, systems still functioning at the end of the orthodontic treatment). (2) Nonosseointegrated mini-plates and mini-screw anchorage systems. Titanium mini-plates were associated with 100 % success in animals, and hardly any loss of these mini-plates (bone anchors) were lost due to infection in human studies, with success rates between 91 % and 100 %. Few long-term studies on nonosseointegrated mini-screws were found, but in animal studies, success rates ranged from 90 % to 100 %. A success rate of more than 75 % in human studies is considered favorable for these orthodontic implants, which confirms the clinical applicability of this type of immediate loading <b>anchor</b> <b>support</b> in orthodontics. Conclusions: Both animal and human studies revealed that mesiodistal and intrusion movements can be reliably carried out by means of skeletal anchorage devices. A drawback is that animal studies do not reflect the real orthodontic clinical situation; thus, the outcome of these studies should be interpreted with caution. Human studies, however, show that orthodontic forces between 100 and 400 grams can be applied successfully to skeletal anchorage devices. Appropriate treatment strategies need to be confirmed by randomized prospective clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|Layered {{manufacturing}} plays {{important role}} in industry. Conventional pro-cess planning takes polygon soup as input and has high quality requirements on these polygonal model such as no self-intersection, no degenerate polygon et al. A growing number of models, especially for those in complex shape are acquired from reverse engineering. Implicit representation always serves as intermediate representation and ¯nally need to be tesselated into polygonal mesh for layered manufacturing applications. However, the present tessellation techniques have difficulties to provide topologically faithful and self-intersection free polygonal mesh from implicit model. On the other hand, implicit representation are mathematically compact and robust, which is important for presenting complex freeform models. I develop a robust and efficient approach to directly slicing implicit solids. Different from prior slicing techniques that reconstruct contours on the slicing plane by tracing the topology of intersected line segments, which is actually not robust, I generate contours through a topology guaranteed contour extraction on binary images sampled from given solids and a subsequent contour simplification algorithm which has the topology preserved and the geometric error controlled. The resultant contours are free of self-intersection, topologically faithful to the given r-regular solids and with shape error bounded; therefore, correct objects can be fabricated from them by layered manufacturing. Moreover, since I {{do not need to}} generate the tessellated B-rep of given solids, my direct slicing approach is memory efficient - only the binary image and the finest contours on one particular slicing plane need to be stored in-core. My method is general and can be applied to any implicit representations of solids. Moreover, I also investigate techniques for support generation for layered manufacturing in image space. Region subtraction is a crucial operation for support generation. I develop a robust and reliable region subtraction method on implicit solid slicing. Compared with the conventional approach in which support regioncontours are produced from part slicing contours by polygonal operations, my approach calculates reasonable support region on binary image for each layer. I investigate a conservative growing-swallow technique to remove as much as possible the support material for self-support region while still guarantee the safety of building process. My region subtraction can serve as core technique for many layered manufacturing processes. In my research, I demonstrate region subtraction technique in both Fused Decomposition Modeling(FDM) and Stereolithography(SLA). A region cleaning technique which can reduce topology complexity of calculated support structure region is developed to fulfil specific requirement of FDM. With all the operations involved being discrete on binary image, my approach is more robust compared with the polygonal operations which are based on numerical computation. Moreover, processing on binary image makes my approach highly parallelizable. My self-intersection free contour extraction technique used in direct slicing can also be adopted to extract support structure contour on binary image if necessary. Huang, Pu. "October 2012.

For ECCA stenting, the 6 -F Kimny guiding catheter was replaced with a 7 -F Kimny guiding catheter and the procedure was performed as the follows. First, a 0. 035 -in. Teflon wire was carefully advanced into the common CA. Second, a PercuSurge GuardWire was inserted into the external CA, followed by distal balloon inflation for an <b>anchoring</b> <b>support.</b> Third, the 6 -F guiding catheter was removed, followed by exchanging a 7 -F kimny guiding catheter which was advanced along the 0. 035 -in. Teflon wire and the PercuSurge GuardWire to proximal part of common CA. Distal protection device was then utilized to protect from distal embolization during the procedure. One procedure failed due to external CA did not provide an <b>anchoring</b> <b>support.</b> Thus, the procedure was successful in 74 (98. 7 %) patients. No vascular or bleeding complication was observed. Minor stroke occurred in 3 (4. 0 %) patients during the procedure. All of them were completely recovery within 1 week. ConclusionsThe TRA approach for ECCA stenting is safe and feasible. This access may offer a last resort for patients with unsuited to femoral arterial access and endarterectomy...|$|R
50|$|In early 2002, {{penstock}} {{civil works}} such as <b>anchors</b> and <b>supports</b> are started and penstock installation was initiated in 2003.The penstock is 2400m long with a drop of 462m. Upper 1235m is a single pipe {{and the rest is}} twin pipes. The penstock has 33 <b>anchors</b> and <b>supports</b> at 12 meters interval. The single type penstock reduces its outer diameter from 1118mm to 1016mm and thereafter to 914mm. At the just upstream 12th anchor the pipe bifurcates into 813mm pipes. The twin pipes further reduce to 711mm and then to 620mm. Before entry to the powerhouse, it reduces to 500mm to suit the inlet valve diameter.|$|R
5000|$|On Monday, November 22, 2010, the Soccer Centre’s expansion's (known most {{commonly}} as [...] "the bubble") collapsed {{for the second}} time in two years. Upon the dilemma, the Soccer Centre committee has decided to construct a more stable variety of roof, with other options consisting of not to rebuild the expansion at all and keep the Subway Soccer Centre as a single structure. According to Perry Logan, the general manager of the Soccer Centre, the collapse was most likely caused by an <b>anchor</b> <b>supporting</b> the bubble collapsing before carving a rip in the material. Fortunately, no one was inside the bubble and therefore no one was injured in the occurring incident.|$|R
50|$|Buildings built {{using the}} AANBUS modules {{are placed on}} {{concrete}} footings anchored {{into the ground and}} do not need external guy wires to <b>anchor</b> and <b>support</b> them. The modules are built of steel with attached insulation and vapor barriers.|$|R
