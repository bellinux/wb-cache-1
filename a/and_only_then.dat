5|$|The Sinclair {{method is}} a method of using {{naltrexone}} or another opioid antagonists to treat alcoholism by having the person take the medication {{about an hour before}} they drink alcohol, <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>then.</b> The medication blocks the positive reinforcement effects of ethanol and hopefully allows the person to stop drinking or drink less.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} someone {{following}} his conscience {{to the point}} of accepting the consequence of being condemned to death is Sir Thomas More (1478-1535)]]. A theologian who wrote on the distinction between the 'sense of duty' and the 'moral sense', as two aspects of conscience, and who saw the former as some feeling that can only be explained by a divine Lawgiver, was John Henry Cardinal Newman. A well known saying of him is that he would first toast on his conscience <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>then</b> on the pope, since his conscience brought him to acknowledge the authority of the pope.|$|E
5|$|If he accepts, and {{is already}} a bishop, he {{immediately}} takes office. If {{he is not a}} bishop, however, he must be first consecrated as one before he can assume office. If a priest is elected, the Cardinal Dean consecrates him bishop; if a layman is elected, then the Cardinal Dean first ordains him deacon, then priest, <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>then</b> consecrates him as bishop. Only after becoming a bishop does the pope-elect take office. These functions of the Dean are assumed, if necessary, by the sub-Dean, and if the sub-Dean is also impeded, they are assumed by the senior cardinal-bishop in attendance. In 2005 the Dean himself—Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger—was elected pope. In 2013, the Dean and sub-Dean were not in attendance (over the age limit), and these functions were assumed by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re.|$|E

5|$|Octavius was {{studying}} and undergoing military training in Apollonia, Illyria, when Julius Caesar {{was killed on}} the Ides of March (15 March) 44BC. He rejected the advice of some army officers to take refuge with the troops in Macedonia and sailed to Italy to ascertain whether he had any potential political fortunes or security. Caesar had no living legitimate children under Roman law, and so had adopted Octavius, his grand-nephew, making him his primary heir. Mark Antony later charged that Octavian had earned his adoption by Caesar through sexual favours, though Suetonius describes Antony's accusation as political slander. After landing at Lupiae near Brundisium, Octavius learned the contents of Caesar's will, <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>then</b> did he decide to become Caesar's political heir as well as heir to two-thirds of his estate.|$|E
5|$|Once woven, the {{material}} {{is sent to the}} BIS laboratories for testing. After quality testing, {{the material}}, if approved, is returned to the factory. It is then separated into three lots which are dyed saffron, white and green. The Ashoka Chakra is screen printed, stencilled or suitably embroidered onto each side of the white cloth. Care also has to be taken that the chakra is completely visible and synchronised on both sides. Three pieces of the required dimension, one of each colour, are then stitched together according to specifications and the final product is ironed and packed. The BIS then checks the colours <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>then</b> can the flag be sold.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} Vidya Balan came with Sarkar's prior work {{experience}} {{with her in}} three music videos. Chopra said that Vidya was screen-tested for six months <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>then</b> they were sure of her acting abilities. Saif once {{said that he was}} not convinced of Vidya's abilities, since Parineeta was to be her first film. He instead hoped to work with established actresses like Aishwarya Rai or Rani Mukherjee. However, after seeing Vidya portray the character of Lalita, he was thoroughly appreciative of her performance. Getting an opportunity to debut with big names from the industry along with a lovely character to portray made Vidya accept the role of Lalita.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged from}} the African coast with a closed circulation on August 3. It tracked westward across the tropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean and broke into two distinct parts, the northern portion eventually became Hurricane Alberto. The southern portion continued to track westward into the Caribbean Sea, while producing little or no deep convection. The wave reached Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula on August 12, <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>then</b> did deep convection redevelop, mostly due to diurnal heating. The wave emerged over the Bay of Campeche early on August 13 as a large area of low pressure. The wave was upgraded to Tropical Depression Five later that day, based on satellite intensity estimates and an observation from an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft. Six hours after developing, the depression was forecast to strengthen into a hurricane early on August 16 due to the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and little wind shear to inhibit development.|$|E
25|$|After {{producing}} and selling the Model A in 1903, Ford Motor Company's Model T {{became the first}} mass-produced automobile in 1908, focusing on affordability for the average consumer.

25|$|The Sinclair {{method is}} a method of using opiate antagonists such as {{naltrexone}} to treat alcoholism. The patient takes the medication about an hour (<b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>then)</b> before drinking to avoid side effects that arise from chronic use. The opioid antagonist blocks the positive reinforcement effects of alcohol and allows the person to stop or reduce drinking.|$|E

In contrast with cold-pour soap which is poured into molds {{and for the most part}} only then saponifies, hot-process soaping for the most part saponifies the oils completely <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>then</b> is poured into molds.|$|E
25|$|It is {{customary}} {{to eat the}} challah or {{bread with}} salt, although the specific practice varies. Some dip the bread into salt before the blessing on bread.

25|$|For decades Grit had {{published}} both a national edition {{and a local}} edition. The local edition was the Sunday newspaper for Williamsport and Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, and was circulated in 13 other counties in north-central Pennsylvania as well. This edition stopped publication in the early 1990s (<b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>then</b> did the Williamsport Sun Gazette begin producing a Sunday paper).|$|E

25|$|In the SN2 mechanism, the {{nucleophile}} forms {{a transition}} {{state with the}} attacked molecule, <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>then</b> the leaving group is cleaved. These two mechanisms differ in the stereochemistry of the products. SN1 leads to the non-stereospecific addition and does not result in a chiral center, but rather {{in a set of}} geometric isomers (cis/trans). In contrast, a reversal (Walden inversion) of the previously existing stereochemistry is observed in the SN2 mechanism.|$|E
25|$|In Linux, kernel may destroy {{memory map}} of the old process and start {{constructing}} (loading) new executable, <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>then</b> discover that the new executable can't be loaded (for example, some fields in executable's internal tables contain invalid values). In this case, process gets killed by a fatal signal (such as SIGSEGV). Ideally, kernel should fail evecve and return error indication in old executable, but this would require significantly more complex (and slower) code in the kernel.|$|E
25|$|The fort's {{interior}} {{was a huge}} logistical resource center, including sawmills, warehouses, quartermaster maintenance depots, ammunition magazines, and living quarters for the 2,000 men who handled the operations and defended the post. The fortress was completed in June 1863, <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>then</b> did Rosecrans dare to move south. The fortress was never attacked, {{in part because the}} Union troops held the town of Murfreesboro hostage by training their artillery on the courthouse. Major portions of the earthworks still exist and have been incorporated into the battlefield site.|$|E

Portraying young men as perpetrators, as people to be feared, does not help them to change. Young men need opportunities to experiment with different ways of behaving that affirm who they are, not what they feel they ought to be. Like young women, they need to be listened to and to have their concerns <b>and</b> needs addressed. <b>Only</b> <b>then</b> can they grow into caring partners <b>and</b> fathers; <b>only</b> <b>then</b> can they learn to treat their children better than they were treated by their parents. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{islands are}} windy, cloudy and cool {{throughout}} the year {{with an average of}} 210 rainy or snowy days per year. The islands lie in the path of depressions moving northeast, making strong winds and heavy rain possible at all times of the year. Sunny days are rare and overcast days are common.

25|$|Controversy also existed {{over how}} the missing reports came to light.

Speculation that DCFEMS purposefully withheld the reports rose when City Council member Phil Mendelson alleged that he requested the reports in January 2006 and the department never delivered them.|$|E
25|$|Since 2003, {{the central}} {{government}} showed an increasing openness on AIDS issues, making several public statements encouraging {{the participation of the}} private sector and, to some extent, NGOs. This was due, in part, to the SARS epidemic, which helped change the way in which government dealt with public health issues. For a prolonged period, the authorities did not admit to having a serious outbreak of SARS until it was a devastating problem <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>then</b> did they decide to come forward and acknowledge the real scale of the epidemic. The new-found frankness helped the government win back some credibility before the international community.|$|E
