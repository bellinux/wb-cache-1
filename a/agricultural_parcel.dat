40|$|Diffuse {{pollution}} {{of water resources}} due to pesticides uses is a major environmental issue in the European Union, regulated by specific legislations: the Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000 / 60 /EC) and the Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides. Solving this environmental problem requires methods and tools for spatial risk analysis, notably at a local scale (<b>agricultural</b> <b>parcel</b> level). This paper presents the first developments of a decision support system aiming to assess surface and ground waters pollution risks due to pesticides uses, based on a Geographic Information System (GIS). Different factors affecting pesticide environmental propagation are taken into account, as for example land use, pesticides properties and application modalities, environment characteristics (soil properties, topography, climate, …) as well as surface and ground waters characteristics. A pesticide emission model is used to assess pesticide leaching or runoff to water resources. The reference scale for risks assessment is the <b>agricultural</b> <b>parcel.</b> The quality of the results obtained will be assessed by comparison with existing water monitoring data and related studies.

40|$|Analysis of {{detailed}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>parcel</b> and farm location data in central Belgium {{is used to}} reveal landscape structure and to identify the processes {{that are responsible for}} this structure. Agricultural land use patterns are deter-mined, at least partly, by the relative location of fields to farms. In particular, grassland is located closer to farms than other land uses. General-purpose land cover maps (CORINE and PELCOM) are compared to raster maps generated from the detailed parcel data. Both the CORINE and PELCOM strongly overestimate arable land use in the study area, and neither is able to correctly represent minor land use classes. The farm location-land use relationship as well as land use quantities and other spatial metrics are found {{to be sensitive to the}} format, source and resolution of the spatial data for the study area. This suggests that the use of PELCOM is not appropriate when landscape scale processes affect the composition and spatial patterns of land use. In this case, it is always better to aggregate fine resolution spatial data. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Agricultural landscapes offer an illustrative context for this purpose.

[br/]The efficiency {{of this approach is}} assessed by comparing it with an approach applying the same LUCC processes without optimization. Simulations have been developed for two representative case studies of temperate intensive agricultural mosaics: (1) neutral landscapes with simple and theoretical rules and (2) observed landscapes with realistic crop successions rules. Results show that this modelling platform improves the simulation of LUCC achieved at fine resolution, although not systematically. Improvements are observed when compared to theoretical farming practices. But, when compared with an observed landscape, it is true for one type of (arable) farms only. Several hypotheses are discussed, such as the fact that farmers possibly do not follow optimized rules.

Our approach incorporates ancillary data such as cropping history (inter-annual crop rotations), context (altitude, soil type) and structure (parcels size and shape) {{to compensate for the}} lack of radiometric data resulting from the use of a single image. The originality of the proposed method resides in the three successive steps used: S 1 : per-pixel classification of a single SPOT XS image with a restricted number of land cover classes (RL) chosen to ensure good accuracy; S 2 : conversion of RLs into a per-parcel classification system using ancillary parcel boundaries; and S 3 : parcel allocation using exhaustive land cover classes (EL) and its refinement through the application of decision rules. The method was tested on a 120 km(2) area (Sousson river basin, Gers, France) where exhaustive knowledge of land cover for two successive years allowed complete validation of our method. It allocated 87 % of the parcels with a 75 % accuracy rate according to the exhaustive list (EL).

For this it is necessary to know the behavior of the relevant variables and develop viable strategies for action in system. The application of the Precision Agriculture principles in a livestock system involves a higher degree of difficulty due to the greater number of factors involved and the presence of animal component. Variables such as mobility, trampling, defecations of animals and preferential areas may impact the system and should be considered. The objective {{of this paper is to}} perform an exploratory analysis of data from monitoring of animals in an experimental plot of a livestock system, evaluating the behavior of animals in different situations, and in future relate this behavior with other factors present in the system. The monitoring of the animals was performed with a set of GPS devices, fixed in six animals from a herd. GPS data (position, velocity, etc.) were complemented by field observations. Data were analyzed with the Kernel intensity estimator in different situations: moving animals; without movement, grazing animals, and nongrazing. Maps resulting from the analysis are presented for the situations investigated. The data analysis allowed us to identify the areas used for the rest of the animals and areas with different grazing intensities. 201...|$|E

Results of the new method are presented in a diagnostic table which includes an indicator expressing the total grantable strips length (in meters) at the exploitation scale. Its calculation is based on existing strips, surface and location of permanent meadow parcels.

The main objective of this work was to estimate the spatial and temporal maize yield uncertainty using stochastic simulation techniques to reduce the economic risk considering the producer risk profile and the international prices of maize and inputs. The results showed that (i) the class yield percentage variation in yield stochastic simulation depends on the sampling density; (ii) higher sampling densities promote an overestimation of low and high yield values compared to those of real yield data; (iii) reducing sampling density promotes the low and high values of overestimation reduction while increasing the central classes values compared to those of real yield data; (iv) the ideal point density for yield stochastic simulation is approximately 65 points/ha; (v) in Mediterranean environments, more than 3 – 4 years’ worth of real yield data considered as a whole {{do not seem to}} improve the parcel level of confidence when cropping irrigated maize; and (vi) the number of equiprobable surfaces that were generated by sequential Gaussian simulation helped to calculate the yield class uncertainty and permitted the study of class yield probabilities for a particular position of the parcel and, therefore, to manage the yield risk and support future decisions.

30|$|Since {{the very}} {{beginning}} of the 1990 s, one of the main application areas of remote sensing in agriculture in Europe has been the control of area-based agricultural subsidies given to the farmers in the framework of the common agricultural policy (CAP) [1]. For many years, this activity, also referred to as controls with remote sensing (CwRS), has consisted in checking whether the area and the crop type declared by the farmer are in line with the real situation as identified mainly from satellite remote sensing data. In the early years, when the identification of crop types was very important, both computer aided photo-interpretation methods (CAPI) and automatic classification procedures were involved in CwRS. Recent changes in the CAP decreased the importance of crop-type identification during the control procedure, while increasing the importance of the detection of anomalies related to the compliance with the rules defined as good agricultural and environmental conditions (GAEC). While CwRS covers the control aspect of the CAP management there is another important element: the land parcel identification system (LPIS). The LPIS is the so called reference system for locating and identifying each <b>agricultural</b> <b>parcel</b> in the EU that is declared in the farmers’ annual applications. The LPIS has to be as up to date as possible in order to reflect the real situation on the ground inside the LPIS parcels in terms of the correct quantification of the maximum eligible area in each LPIS parcel. For identification of these parcels, the use of digital geographic information system (GIS) techniques has been compulsory since January 2005, by a legislation change in 2000 [2].|$|E

According to this Legislation, the Member States must initiale measures to limit environmental and toxicologieal effects caused by pesticide uses. The Agricultural Research Centre of Wallonia (CRA-W) emphasized the need of a toot for spatial risk analysis and develops it within the framework of PESTEAUX project. The originality of the approach proposed by the CRA-W is to generate maps to identify the risk of pollution at locale scale (<b>agricultural</b> <b>parcel).</b> The risk will be assessed according to the study of different factors, grouped under 3 data's tayers: polluting pressure, vulnerability of the physical environment (soil) and meteorological data. This approach is directly based on the risk's definition which takes into account the polluting pressure, linked te the human activities, and the vulnerabitity of the soil, defined by factors of physical environment which characterize the water flow in the parcel. Moreover, meteorological data influence the intensity and likelihoad flow of water, and indirectly pesticide by leaching or runoff. The PESTEAUX's approach to study the pollution is based on the model "source-vector-target". The source is the polluting pressure, in other words, the pesticides which could reach the targets. The main vector is the water which vehicles the pesticide on and trough the soil until the target which are the surface waters or ground waters. ln this paper we introduce the factors contributing to the polluting pressure. These factors are linking to the human activities and more precisely, to the pesticide uses. The factors considered have an influence on pesticide's transport by water (in its solid state or in dissolved state by leaching, run-off, or erosion) but also on a set of process controlling pesticide behavior in the environment such as degradation, sorption, [...] Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Agricultural {{conservation}} easements (ACEs) {{involve the}} significant expenditure {{of public funds}} through either tax benefits and/or direct public expenditures. The selection of <b>agricultural</b> <b>parcels</b> for conservation should, therefore, maximise net public benefits {{to the extent possible}} within financial constraints and the need for agricultural viability to maintain working landscapes. Some programmes select <b>agricultural</b> <b>parcels</b> for conservation easements based only on agricultural viability and/or land cost, however, without explicit consideration of the many other public benefits often associated with ACEs. This paper illustrates application of a method for increasing the public benefits of agricultural conservation easements through a case study in the northern San Joaquin Valley of California. The method is a strategic planning process that incorporates both a GIS-based quantitative assessment and a more qualitative assessment. Such an approach is a supplement to - rather than a substitute for - the more science-based Landscape Evaluation and Site Evaluation (LESA) approach developed by the US Soil Conservation Service (SCS) and cost-minimisation approaches that emphasise economic considerations. However, we show that public land use planning and regulatory policies are essential for agricultural conservation.

40|$|An {{approach}} {{to use the}} available <b>agricultural</b> <b>parcel</b> information to automatically select training samples for crop classification is investigated. Previous research addressed the multi-evidence crop classification approach using an ensemble classifier. This first produced confidence measures using three Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks trained separately with spectral, texture and vegetation indices; classification labels were then assigned based on Endorsement Theory. The present study proposes an {{approach to}} feed this ensemble classifier with automatically selected training samples. The available vector data representing crop boundaries with corresponding crop codes are used {{as a source for}} training samples. These vector data are created by farmers to support subsidy claims and are, therefore, prone to errors such as mislabeling of crop codes and boundary digitization errors. The proposed approach is named as ECRA (Ensemble based Cluster Refinement Approach). ECRA first automatically removes mislabeled samples and then selects the refined training samples in an iterative training-reclassification scheme. Mislabel removal is based on the expectation that mislabels in each class will be far from cluster centroid. However, this must be a soft constraint, especially when working with a hypothesis space that does not contain a good approximation of the targets classes. Difficulty in finding a good approximation often exists either due to less informative data or a large hypothesis space. Thus this approach uses the spectral, texture and indices domains in an ensemble framework to iteratively remove the mislabeled pixels from the crop clusters declared by the farmers. Once the clusters are refined, the selected border samples are used for final learning and the unknown samples are classified using the multi-evidence approach. The study is implemented with WorldView- 2 multispectral imagery acquired for a study area containing 10 crop classes. The proposed approach is compared with the multi-evidence approach based on training samples selected randomly and border samples based on initial cluster centroids within agricultural parcels without any refinement. The results clarify the improvement in overall classification accuracy to 82. 3 % based on the proposed approach from 74. 9 % based on random selection and 71. 4 % on non-refined border samples...|$|E
