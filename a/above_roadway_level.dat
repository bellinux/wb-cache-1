50|$|Crathie Bridge (1854-1857) is a 125 foot {{single span}} across the River Dee {{to the royal}} Balmoral estate. The bridge had first been drawn with a form of the Brunel truss echoing his Royal Albert Bridge at Saltash. The bridge as {{constructed}} though used the C-shaped open form of the upper flange, as used for the Eastern Bengal Railway. As the bridge was only for light road traffic, it was also possible to replace the solid web of the girder <b>above</b> the <b>roadway</b> <b>level</b> with an openwork lattice, making {{the view from the}} bridge visually more appealing for its illustrious resident. Despite this, Her Majesty was 'not amused' by the bridge.|$|R
500|$|This road {{is one of}} {{the highest}} scenic <b>roadways</b> <b>above</b> sea <b>level</b> in the US between the Rocky and Allegheny mountains. During the winter, Brockway Mountain Drive is closed to cars as the Keweenaw County Road Commission does not plow the road; instead the drive is used as a {{snowmobile}} trail. According to the commission, 200vehicles per day use the roadway on average. There are no posted speed limits along the roadway, however {{in the words of a}} former Keweenaw County Sheriff's Department deputy, [...] "the nature and design of the road was such that the 'problem' of people driving too fast... was basically 'self-correcting'." ...|$|R
2500|$|Construction of the {{new road}} deck and {{stiffening}} truss of the 1950 span was conducted differently than had been done in Gertie's case. In 1940, the road deck was prefabricated in [...] long sections on the Tacoma tideflats, then barged to the site via tugboats and hoisted into place via gantry cranes installed on the main cable. When construction of the road deck began in early March, workers installed a Chicago boom high <b>above</b> the <b>roadway</b> <b>level,</b> upon which prefabricated stiffening truss assemblies each -by- were hoisted into place. After the deck assemblies were hoisted into place and finished, four traveling derricks were then lifted onto the completed deck sections. [...] After the traveling derricks (called [...] "layleg rigs" [...] by the crew) were assembled and readied, the deck was then assembled {{in a series of}} steps. On the new bridge, the stiffening truss featured a series of outer members called [...] "chords" [...] that formed {{the top and bottom of}} the stiffening truss. These were installed first, then the diagonal and vertical truss members on the sides were installed.

Then, a series of lateral bracing struts were installed on the top and bottom of the road deck - that connected to the outer steel chords. Next, a series of eight [...] deep I-beam [...] "stringers" [...] were installed (positioned longitudinally). This was the final steelwork step involved, and the deck was soon raised [...] on each corner to attach the suspender cables and their [...] "jewels" [...] to the vertical stiffening truss members.|$|R

50|$|Brentwood Town Centre {{station is}} located {{directly}} above Lougheed Highway. It {{is the only}} station in the system that is built on median, with the entire station footprint located directly <b>above</b> a <b>roadway.</b> The station is also designed {{to serve as a}} pedestrian overpass across Lougheed Highway, which requires the station platforms to be high <b>above</b> the <b>roadway</b> and a mezzanine/concourse to be built below the platform level. The station is one of the only three on Millennium Line, beside Lougheed Town Centre station and Gilmore station, that features a concourse level.|$|R
50|$|The {{stations}} are designed as elevated structures with ticketing facilities {{on either the}} ground level (as seen in the KL Sentral station) or the first-floor level. The platforms are on the top floor, separated from the monorail lines by fencing. They were originally covered by large canvas roofs, which were replaced in 2014 by aluminium zinc roofs.

Monte Pinu (OT), in Northern Sardinia, occurred after an extreme rainfall event on November, 18 th 2013. The collapse, which caused some casualties, is mainly due to collapse of the steel pipe, exacerbated by corrosion {{on the bottom of}} the tunnel and the simultaneous softening and washout of the adjacent soil during the rainstorm. In addition, the culverts nearby, al-though not collapsed, are in condition of instability or of potential danger. The authors illu-strate the collapse features and provide indications on monitoring and consolidation activi-ties to adopt in similar cases...|$|R

Field observations and experiments analysis show that an exhaust air <b>roadway,</b> <b>level</b> 100 of the Xiajing Coal Mine in Guangxi, China, {{is located in}} an intumescing rock with high in situ stress. Then we designed a bolt-mesh-anchor coupling support for the roadway repair and reinforcement, which consists of a first coupling support with bolt-mesh and secondary reinforcement with anchor cables. Field monitoring results show that bolt-mesh -cable coupling support has guaranteed the stabilization of the roadway and reduced the deformation of the surrounding rock considerably...|$|R
50|$|Its unique design, {{combining}} {{elements of}} a cable-stayed bridge and a prestressed cantilever hollow-box girder bridge, with triangular concrete walls <b>above</b> the <b>roadway</b> which contain the prestressed cable-stays, has been awarded many prizes. This hybrid type of cable-stayed and girder bridge is {{sometimes referred to as}} an extradosed bridge.|$|R
5000|$|The viaduct, {{situated}} {{at the bottom of}} the Lydbrook Valley where it meets the Wye Valley, consisted of five stone arches and three wrought iron lattice truss girders. The viaduct rose some 80 feet <b>above</b> the <b>roadway</b> below, linking Forge Hill on the east with Randor on the west.|$|R
50|$|It has {{the fairly}} unusual feature that the truss {{carrying}} the roadway (a continuous stiffening component) is <b>above</b> the <b>roadway</b> itself and meets {{up with the}} cables making it non uniform in height. A similar bridge, the Walter Taylor Bridge, was built over the Brisbane River in Brisbane, Australia in 1936.|$|R

At its southern terminus near the Sydney Observatory, the cycleway is located adjacent to the Western Distributor and connects with the Kent Street cycleway. The northern terminus of the cycleway is at Burton Street, , just below Milsons Point railway station. From this location riders ascend 55 stairs in order to access the path that {{is located on the}} <b>roadway</b> <b>level,</b> some 51 m above the water level.

50|$|The first North End Bridge opened 1887 with {{a sturdy}} metal {{box-shaped}} truss (the {{upper part of}} the box being suspended <b>above</b> the <b>roadway.</b> In 1923, the tar-sealed wooden decking caught fire, which was made worse by the gas mains the bridge carried. The replacement bridge at this location is still in use.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the dangers}} {{discussed}} <b>above,</b> <b>roadway</b> lights are properly used sparingly and only when a particular situation justifies increasing the risk. This usually involves an intersection with several turning movements and much signage, situations where drivers must take in much information quickly {{that is not in}} the headlights' beam. In these situations (A freeway junction or exit ramp) the intersection may be lit so that drivers can quickly see all hazards, and a well designed plan will have gradually increasing lighting for approximately a quarter of a minute before the intersection and gradually decreasing lighting after it. The main stretches of highways remain unlighted to preserve the driver's night vision and increase the visibility of oncoming headlights. If there is a sharp curve where headlights will not illuminate the road, a light {{on the outside of the}} curve is often justified.|$|R
5000|$|These {{structures}} can {{be located}} either <b>above</b> the <b>roadway</b> {{or below the}} roadway. In the U.S., access under the Americans with Disabilities Act requirements means that stairs cannot be the only access to these structures. An elevator must be provided or a ramp built that conforms to the grade requirements under the ADA regulations.|$|R
50|$|The George Washington Carver Bridge {{is located}} in Des Moines, Iowa over the Raccoon River. Part of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Parkway, the bridge {{provides}} three roadway lanes {{in one direction and}} two roadway lanes and one bikeway/pedestrian lane in the opposite direction framed by two arches. The main supporting structures and free standing arches are visible at the <b>roadway</b> <b>level.</b> The <b>roadway</b> is suspended by cables from two steel arches, painted blue to complement the site's abundant greenery and to clearly mark the river crossing. The arches, with their concrete superstructures, appear to float over the water framing the views of the skyline and Iowa's tallest skyscraper, creating a welcoming gateway to the city from the airport.|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge is}} a similar design to the Hercilio Luz Bridge in Florianópolis, Brazil, with the truss {{carrying}} the bridge being <b>above</b> the <b>roadway</b> and meeting the cables at non-uniform heights. This means that the suspension cables actually form the top chord of the truss, and this configuration {{is known as the}} Steinman (after its inventor) or Florianópolis type.|$|R

50|$|Only {{a single}} pair of {{overhead}} wires was installed {{along the entire}} Fribourg-Farvagny route. This catenary arrangement consisted of two copper wires, 65 mm in diameter, mounted 30 cm apart.
