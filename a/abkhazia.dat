5|$|On 9 September 2008, Russia {{announced}} that its troops in South Ossetia and <b>Abkhazia</b> would remain under bilateral agreements with their respective de facto governments. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov {{said that a}} military presence in <b>Abkhazia</b> and South Ossetia was essential to prevent Georgia from regaining control. Georgia considers <b>Abkhazia</b> and South Ossetia Russian-occupied territories. In November 2011, the European Parliament passed a resolution recognising <b>Abkhazia</b> and South Ossetia as occupied Georgian territories.|$|E
5|$|The main {{legacy of}} the SSR <b>Abkhazia</b> is that it created, {{for the first time}} in modern history, a defined {{geographic}} entity under the name <b>Abkhazia.</b> The Abkhaz people were cognizant of their republic and its quasi-independent status, and though it was removed in 1931 they did not forget that it had existed. The SSR <b>Abkhazia</b> would take a prominent role during the glasnost and perestroika era of the late 1980s, as Abkhaz leaders called for their state to once again be formed and break away from Georgia, citing the SSR <b>Abkhazia</b> as a precedent. This led to them restoring the 1925 SSR Abkhazian constitution, which ultimately led to the 1992–1993 war between <b>Abkhazia</b> and Georgia, and the modern Abkhaz–Georgian conflict.|$|E
5|$|This {{situation}} was mirrored in <b>Abkhazia,</b> an autonomous republic in the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, where the Abkhaz seceded from Georgia {{during the war}} in the early 1990s. The population of <b>Abkhazia</b> was reduced to 216,000 after an ethnic cleansing of Georgians, the single largest ethnic group in the region, a decrease from 525,000 before the war. The upper Kodori Gorge (in northeast <b>Abkhazia)</b> remained beyond the unrecognised Abkhaz separatist government's control.|$|E

25|$|The exact size of <b>Abkhazia's</b> {{population}} was unclear. According to the census {{carried out in}} 2003 it measured 215,972 people, but this is contested by Georgian authorities. The Department of Statistics of Georgia estimated <b>Abkhazia's</b> population to be approximately 179,000 in 2003, and 178,000 in 2005 (the last year when such estimates were published in Georgia). Encyclopædia Britannica estimates the population in 2007 at 180,000 and the International Crisis Group estimates <b>Abkhazia's</b> total population in 2006 to be between 157,000 and 190,000 (or between 180,000 and 220,000 as estimated by UNDP in 1998).|$|R
5|$|Georgia began proposing the {{placement}} of international peacekeeping forces in the separatist regions when Russia began to apply more pressure on Georgia after April 2008. The West launched new initiatives for peace settlement, with peace plans being offered and conferences being organised by the European Union, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and Germany. Georgia accepted the German project for <b>Abkhazia,</b> but the separatists dismissed it. Russia and the separatists did not attend an EU-funded peace conference on <b>Abkhazia.</b> They also dismissed an OSCE offer to renew talks regarding South Ossetia.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Nauru {{recognised}} Kosovo as {{an independent}} country, and in 2009 Nauru became the fourth country, after Russia, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, to recognise <b>Abkhazia,</b> a breakaway region of Georgia. Russia {{was reported to be}} giving Nauru $50million in humanitarian aid {{as a result of this}} recognition. On 15 July 2008, the Nauruan government announced a port refurbishment programme, financed with US$9million of development aid received from Russia. The Nauru government claims this aid is not related to its recognising <b>Abkhazia</b> and South Ossetia.|$|E
5|$|In early March 2008, <b>Abkhazia</b> and South Ossetia {{submitted}} formal {{requests for}} their recognition to Russia's parliament {{shortly after the}} West's recognition of Kosovo to which Russia was opposed. Dmitry Rogozin, Russian ambassador to NATO, warned that Georgia's NATO membership aspirations would cause Russia to support the independence of <b>Abkhazia</b> and South Ossetia. The Russian State Duma adopted a resolution on 21 March, in which it called on the President of Russia and the government to consider the recognition.|$|E

5|$|The SSR <b>Abkhazia</b> was an {{ethnically diverse}} region. The {{demographics}} of <b>Abkhazia</b> shifted considerably {{in the decades}} following its annexation by Russia. Large numbers of ethnic Abkhaz had been deported {{in the late nineteenth}} century, with up to 100,000 expelled, mainly sent to the Ottoman Empire. The result was that by the time the SSR <b>Abkhazia</b> was formed, ethnic Abkhaz comprised less than 30% of the population (55,918), which numbered 201,016 according to the 1926 Soviet census, the only census conducted during the existence of the SSR <b>Abkhazia.</b> The korenizatsiia policy implemented in this era, which was to promote minority groups within the USSR, saw the numbers of Abkhaz increase: between 1922 and 1926, ethnic Abkhaz grew by roughly 8%, and constituted about 27.8% of the population; in this same time-frame, the number of ethnic Georgians fell from 42% to 36% (67,494). Other major ethnic groups counted in the 1926 census were Armenians (25,677, or 12.7%), Greeks (14,045, or 7%), and Russians (12,553, or 6.2%).|$|E
5|$|The {{mandate of}} the OSCE mission in Georgia expired on 1 January 2009, after Russia vetoed its extension. OSCE {{monitors}} had been denied access to South Ossetia since the war. The {{mandate of the}} UNOMIG expired on 16 June 2009; its extension was also vetoed by Russia, which argued that the mandate did not properly reflect Russia's position of recognising <b>Abkhazia</b> as an independent state. According to UN mission head Johan Verbeke, about 60,000 ethnic Georgians in <b>Abkhazia</b> became vulnerable after the mission's end.|$|E

5|$|An {{ethnically diverse}} region, <b>Abkhazia</b> was {{nominally}} {{led by the}} titular Abkhaz people, who made up less than 30% of the population; other major groups included Georgians, Armenians, Greeks, and Russians. Even though they did not form the majority, the Abkhaz were heavily favoured, and the Abkhaz language was promoted, {{a result of the}} korenizatsiia policies of the era. An Abkhaz national identity was promoted through these policies, instilling a sense of Abkhaz nationalism.|$|E
5|$|Having no {{children}} of his own, David adopted his kinsman, the young prince Bagrat, heir to the Bagratid throne of Kartli (Iberia). He did so {{at the request of}} the energetic Georgian nobleman Iovane Marushis-dze. Through his fortunate bloodlines Bagrat was destined to sit upon two thrones. Furthermore, through his mother Gurandukht, sister of the childless Abkhazian king Theodosius III, Bagrat was a potential heir to the realm of <b>Abkhazia.</b> Making a plan for the creation of an all-Georgian state, David occupied Kartli for his foster-son in 976 and repulsed the troops from the easternmost Georgian kingdom of Kakheti, which had recently occupied the western sector of Kartli with its rock-hewn city of Uplistsikhe. Two years later, in 978, David and Marushis-dze secured the crown of <b>Abkhazia</b> for Bagrat by displacing Theodosius III.|$|E

5|$|Russia saw the Black Sea {{coast and}} {{the border with}} Turkey as {{invaluable}} strategic attributes of Georgia. Russia had more vested interests in <b>Abkhazia</b> than in South Ossetia, since the Russian military presence on the Black Sea coast was seen as vital to Russian influence in the Black Sea.

5|$|Russian forces {{advanced}} into western Georgia from <b>Abkhazia</b> on 11 August. This {{marked the}} opening of a new front. Russian troops captured the police stations in Zugdidi despite earlier Russian official claims of not intending to expand assault to Georgia proper. Russian forces reached the town of Senaki that day and captured a military base there.|$|E
5|$|Russian forces {{temporarily}} {{occupied the}} Georgian cities of Zugdidi, Senaki, Poti, and Gori, {{holding on to}} these areas beyond the ceasefire. The South Ossetians destroyed most ethnic Georgian villages in South Ossetia and were responsible for an ethnic cleansing of Georgians. Russia recognised the independence of <b>Abkhazia</b> and South Ossetia from Georgia on 26 August; in response, the Georgian government severed diplomatic relations with Russia. Russia mostly completed its withdrawal of troops from undisputed parts of Georgia on 8 October. In the aftermath, Russia's international relations were largely unharmed. The war displaced 192,000 people and while many returned to their homes after the war, 20,272 people, mostly ethnic Georgians, remained displaced as of 2014. Russia has, since the war, occupied <b>Abkhazia</b> and South Ossetia {{in violation of the}} ceasefire agreement of August 2008.|$|E
