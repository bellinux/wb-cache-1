5|$|There are {{significantly}} fewer bughouse openings {{than there are}} chess openings. Many chess openings create weaknesses which can be easily exploited in bughouse. It is for instance not recommended to move pawns other than the d- and e-pawns. Bughouse openings are generally geared towards dominating vital squares and fast development. Captured pieces become available {{after the first few}} moves <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> to develop at this stage as there is often not enough time to do so later. Development also helps to defend against early piece drop attacks.|$|E

25|$|When inhaled, lead(II,IV) oxide irritates lungs. In case of high dose, {{the victim}} {{experiences}} a metallic taste, chest pain, and abdominal pain. When ingested, it is dissolved in the gastric acid and absorbed, leading to lead poisoning.

Some models are designed to make this date visible through a 'window', although others will require the opening of the case to find the date stamp.|$|E

The sensei decides by need rather than speed; therefore, an {{arrangement}} is not finished until the sensei approves the piece. The sensei can readjust and dismantle an arrangement to fit the lesson. Participants must not express grievances in the classroom, as to avoid offending the sensei. Additionally, participants should record notes of the critique.|$|E

25|$|Herbicide — Asulam (also {{known as}} Asulox) is {{selective}} for ferns; glyphosate is not; but {{the latter has}} the advantage that the effects can be seen soon after application. They are applied when the fronds are fully unfurled {{to ensure that the}} chemical is fully absorbed. Rare ferns such as adder’s tongue, killanery and lemon-scented ferns can also be found in similar habitats <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> that these are not destroyed in the process of bracken control.|$|E
25|$|Studying bilingual {{acquisition}} {{is important}} because it may have real effects on academic performances for bilingual children in school. Research has shown that vocabulary size is an indicator of academic performance and literacy. As we know, different contexts can cause differences in vocabulary in each language. Despite these differences, have suggested that bilingual children are not necessarily disadvantaged in academic performance or academic spoken language because they have a good grasp on the language used for their academics. Regardless, home vocabulary is still relevant to academic life, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> to get a better balance in vocabulary acquisition to be able to effectively communicate in both languages.|$|E
25|$|The long through ball: This is a long, {{and usually}} high, pass from a teams' own half, {{over the heads}} of the other team's defence. It is {{intended}} for the attacking players to chase <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> that they remain in an onside position until the ball is kicked. The tactic works best with strong and fast forwards who will have a good chance of winning back the ball, taking control over it, and eventually getting a shot on goal. In the diagram, the ball (red line) is played in front of the furthermost forward, the dotted blue line showing their run. In this example, a through-ball pass along the ground would be picked up by one of the defenders (black team) because the gap between the two central defenders is too small.|$|E

25|$|Both {{gender and}} sex are {{significant}} {{factors that influence}} health. Sex is characterized by female and male biological differences in regards to gene expression, hormonal concentration, and anatomical characteristics. Gender {{is an expression of}} behavior and lifestyle choices. Both sex and gender inform each other, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> to note that differences between the two genders influence disease manifestation and associated healthcare approaches.Understanding how the interaction of sex and gender contributes to disparity in the context of health allows providers to ensure quality outcomes for patients. This interaction is complicated by the difficulty of distinguishing between sex and gender given their intertwined nature; sex modifies gender, and gender can modify sex, thereby impacting health. Sex and gender can both be considered sources of health disparity; both contribute to men and women’s susceptibility to various health conditions, including cardiovascular disease and autoimmune disorders.|$|E
25|$|Irish Terriers {{are good}} with people. They have a highly {{developed}} sense of loyalty <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> {{that they have}} a strong responsible leader, for whom they have natural respect. Most Irish Terriers love children and tolerate rough-housing to a certain extent. Irish terriers need exercise; do not get one if you are not prepared to walk it. They enjoy training, new tasks are easily mastered with food and toys working equally well as motivation. Irish terriers have less of an eagerness to please people than some other breeds but have mental ability and enjoy puzzle solving. They respond best to consistent, reward based training from a relaxed, authoritative person. As with all dog breeds, violence should never be used – instead use distraction and reward the behaviour you want. It is always best to outwit and lure. When seeking a trainer, one should look for a person who has experience with terriers.|$|E
25|$|Spatial cues such as {{geometric}} boundaries or orienting landmarks {{are important}} examples of metric input. Place cells mainly rely on set distal cues rather than cues {{in the immediate}} proximal environment. Movement can also be an important spatial cue. The ability of place cells to incorporate new movement information is called path integration, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> for keeping track of self-location during movement. Path integration is largely aided by grid cells, which are a type of neuron in the entorhinal cortex that relay information to place cells in the hippocampus. Grid cells establish a grid representation of a location, so that during movement place cells can fire according to their new location while orienting according to the reference grid of their external environment. Visual sensory inputs can also supply important contextual information. A change in color of a specific object can affect {{whether or not a}} place cell fires in a particular field. Thus, visuospatial sensory information is critical to the formation and recollection of place field.|$|E

He enjoyed his best goal return in 2004–05, top scoring for Preston with 21 goals in 52 appearances. This helped Preston reach the 2005 Championship play-off Final, where they were beaten 1–0 by West Ham United at the Millennium Stadium. Cresswell played poorly in the first half, but had a number of chances on goal during the second half.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Townsend {{announced}} that he was using other guitars besides his Peavey models, including two Sadowsky Telecaster models and a number of Framus semi-hollow body guitars. In regard to this, Townsend stated on HeavyBlogIsHeavy.com: [...] "The Peavey situation was intense and a real eye opener in terms of how things REALLY work in the business side of endorsements, and I can’t say I really enjoyed it, but we got the guitar out and everyone is nice to each other so all good... I really like that V. However, I decided to use other guitars for other stuff as well, a Sadowsky Tele set, a Framus hollowbody group of guitars, and the V’s. No one is entirely happy with that decision, but I find it difficult to not be straight up with folks about what I want to play and do and have typically pissed people off as a result... The bottom line though is I like what I like <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> to the music to be accurate with tones and vibe.

30|$|One {{compelling}} {{argument for}} using L&D terminology is its simplicity and tangibility. Policy-makers and other decision-makers, including scientists or science-funding agencies, demand summaries, brief abstracts, and simplified methods, concepts, <b>and</b> headlines. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> to note, however, {{that there are}} potential problems associated with simplification. The challenge, as Einstein apocryphally said, is to make things “simple, but not more simple than necessary,” <b>and</b> so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> {{to remember that the}} use of the L&D concept comes with the risk of oversimplifying and watering down the true complexity of climate change processes and impacts.|$|R
