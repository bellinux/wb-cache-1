5000|$|The Resale Rights Directive {{created a}} {{right for the}} creators {{of works of art}} to {{participate}} in the proceeds of the resale of their work. This right, which is sometime known by its French name droit de suite, is personal to the artist and can only be transferred by inheritance. It is calculated as a proportion of the resale price (net of tax), which varies between 4 and 5 percent for the portion of the resale <b>price</b> up to <b>EUR</b> 50,000 and 0.25% for the portion of the resale <b>price</b> above <b>EUR</b> 500,000. The total royalty is limited at EUR 12,500, equivalent to a resale <b>price</b> of <b>EUR</b> 2,000,000. Member States may choose to exempt sales of less than EUR 3000 from royalty. Works of art which are covered by this resale right are [...] "works of graphic or plastic art such as pictures, collages, paintings, drawings, engravings, prints, lithographs, sculptures, tapestries, ceramics, glassware and photographs, provided they are made by the artist herself or himself or are copies which have been made in limited numbers by the artist or under his or her authority." ...|$|R

50|$|On March 6, 2007 Spyker {{announced}} the C12 Zagato at the Salon International de l'Auto in Geneva. The Milanese design house Zagato co-designed the model. The C12 Zagato featured all-new design elements inspired by Formula 1. Though the exterior styling is {{somewhat of a}} departure from the C8, retained features include: scissor doors, interior styling, and general aviation theme. The C12 Zagato is powered by a 6.0 L W12 engine sourced from VW Group (the same engine as featured in the Audi A8 and Volkswagen Phaeton). For the C12 Zagato, Spyker Cars have tuned the W12 to produce 500-bhp. The engine is mated to a five-speed automatic gearbox with paddle shifters. Although the nomenclature suggests otherwise, the C12 Zagato is not based upon the C12 LaTurbie prototype. The Spyker C12 Zagato is <b>priced</b> at <b>EUR</b> 495,000 (approximately US$740,000 or £450,000), and Spyker plan to produce only 24 copies.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{test the}} three-parameter {{symmetric}} variance gamma (SVG) option pricing {{model and the}} four-parameter asymmetric variance gamma (<b>AVG)</b> option <b>pricing</b> model empirically. Prices of the Hang Seng Index call options, which are of European style, are used as {{the data for the}} empirical test. Since the variance gamma option pricing model is developed for the pricing of European options, the empirical test gives a more conclusive answer than previous papers, which used American option data to the applicability of the VG models. The present study uses a large number of intraday option data, which span over a period of 3 years. Synchronous option and futures data are used throughout the study. Pairwise comparisons between the accuracy of model prices are carried out using both parametric and nonparametric methods. The conclusion is that the VG option pricing model performs marginally better than the Black–Scholes (BS) model. Under the historical approach, the VG models can moderately iron out some of the systematic biases inherent in the BS model. However, under the implied approach, the VG models continue to exhibit predictable biases and its overall performance in pricing and hedging is still far less than desirable. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
5|$|Prized for its {{meat and}} fins, the {{porbeagle}} {{has long been}} under heavy fishing pressure. The meat is sold fresh, frozen, or dried and salted, and ranks among the most valuable of any shark: in 1997 and 1998 it had a wholesale <b>price</b> of <b>EUR</b> 5–7/kg, four {{times that of the}} blue shark (Prionace glauca). Most of the demand comes from Europe, though the United States and Japan also import this species. The fins are shipped to East Asia for use in shark fin soup. The remainder of the shark may also be utilized, for production of leather, liver oil, and fishmeal. International trade in the porbeagle appears to be significant, but remains unquantified as shark products tend not to be reported to the species level, and many consist of a mix of various species. This shark is caught most readily on longlines, but is also susceptible to gillnets, driftnets, trawls, and handlines. It is valuable enough to be generally retained when caught as bycatch; if storage space cannot be spared it may be finned and the carcass discarded.|$|R
