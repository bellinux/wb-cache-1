60|$|I fear your tragedy [1] {{will find}} me {{in a very}} unfit state of mind to sit in {{judgment}} on it. I have been {{during the last three}} months undergoing a process of intellectual exsiccation. During my long illness I had compelled into hours of delight many a sleepless painful hour of darkness by chasing down metaphysical game, and since then I have continued the hunt, till I found myself, unaware, at the root of pure mathematics, and up that tall smooth tree, whose few poor branches are all at the very summit, am I climbing by pure <b>adhesive</b> <b>strength</b> of arms and thighs, still slipping down, still renewing my ascent. You would not know me! All sounds of similitude keep at such a distance from each other in my mind, that I have forgotten how to make a rhyme. I look at the mountains (that visible God Almighty that looks in at all my windows)--I look at the mountains only for the curves of their outlines; the stars, as I behold them, form themselves into triangles; and my hands are scarred with scratches from a cat, whose back I was rubbing in the dark in order to see whether the sparks from it were refrangible by a prism. The Poet is dead in me; my imagination (or rather the Somewhat that had been imaginative) lies like a cold snuff on the circular rim of a brass candlestick, without even a stink of tallow to remind you that it was once clothed and mitred with flame. That is past by. I was once a volume of gold leaf, rising and riding on every breath of Fancy, but I have beaten myself back into weight and density, and now I sink in quicksilver and remain squat and square on the earth amid the hurricane that makes oaks and straws join in one dance, fifty yards high in the element.|$|E
50|$|Surface {{roughness}} {{can also}} affect the <b>adhesive</b> <b>strength.</b> Surfaces with roughness {{on the scale}} of 1-2 micrometres can yield better wetting because they have a larger surface area. Thus, more intermolecular interactions at closer distances can arise, yielding stronger attractions and larger <b>adhesive</b> <b>strength.</b> Once the roughness becomes larger, on the order of 10 micrometres, the coating can no longer wet effectively, resulting in less contact area and a smaller <b>adhesive</b> <b>strength.</b>|$|E

30|$|An {{evaluation}} of the <b>adhesive</b> shear <b>strengths</b> also revealed {{the effect of the}} adherend material on the <b>adhesive</b> bond <b>strength.</b> Similar observations have been previously made, with researchers noting that the stiffer, stronger adhrends possessed stronger bond strengths. The A 1 displayed higher <b>adhesive</b> bond <b>strengths</b> for steel in comparison to both aluminum alloys, with <b>adhesive</b> shear <b>strengths</b> for the steel alloy being at least twice those of the aluminum alloys. The difference in <b>adhesive</b> shear <b>strengths</b> with adherend material was not as distinct  with the  A 2 adhesive. There was not much disparity observed between the <b>adhesive</b> shear <b>strengths</b> for the steel and aluminum alloys, except for adhesive strenghts observed at surface roughness values obtained with the 320 grit SiC emery papers. Although the maximum <b>adhesive</b> shear <b>strength</b> was observed with the steel alloy, the lowest shear strength was also observed with this alloy.  Therefore, the type of adhesive  would also influence the extent the adherend material  impacts the bond strength.|$|R
30|$|In {{a series}} of studies, {{development}} of a new aqueous emulsion-type adhesive for use with wood or paper, which does not release formaldehyde or volatile organic solvents, was attempted. For the purpose of increasing both initial and final <b>adhesive</b> <b>strengths,</b> we selected a system consisting of acrylic monomers copolymerized with functional monomers such as diacetone acrylamide and some cross-linking agents such as dihydrazide or polymeric methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (pMDI). It was found that dihydrazide cross-linker was effective for both the initial and final <b>adhesive</b> <b>strengths,</b> suggesting contribution of hydrazone bonds to the bonding strengths. Cross-linking with pMDI might be slow and was not important in the initial bonding. However, its cross-linking effect might develop gradually, because the adhesive showed good final strengths using pMDI as a cross-linker.|$|R
40|$|Purpose – To {{evaluate}} {{the efficiency of}} modifying epoxy resin using phenol-nonyl phenol based polymer (PNPF) for toughness improvement and optimise the results of such a modification. Design/methodology/approach – For effective toughening, various compositions were made by incorporating PNPF at different concentrations. The impact and <b>adhesive</b> <b>strengths</b> of the unmodified and modified epoxy networks were characterised. Findings – The modification of epoxy resin using PNPF showed significant enhancement of impact and <b>adhesive</b> <b>strengths</b> over the unmodified one. The modification caused {{the formation of a}} chemical linkage between PNPF and resin which led not only to a phase separation, but also to formation of intrinsically strong chemical bonds across the PNPF phase/resin matrix interphase, which was the main cause of the improved impact and <b>adhesive</b> <b>strengths.</b> The optimum results were obtained at 10 phr (parts per 100 parts of epoxy resin) of modifier. Research limitations/implications – The modifier, PNPF, used in the present context was synthesised from phenol, nonyl phenol and formalin using oxalic acid as catalyst. Practical implications – The developed method provided a simple and practical solution to improving the toughness of a cured epoxy. Originality/value – The method for enhancing toughness of a cured epoxy was novel and could find numerous applications in the surface coating and adhesive...|$|R

50|$|The most {{commonly}} employed {{method is to}} use tape or a general purpose adhesive dressing. Unfortunately the adhesive used on the tape or dressing will generally be inappropriate for this use. The <b>adhesive</b> <b>strength</b> may change when reaching body temperature, or over time.As the operation progresses this can cause the adhesive to stop working and become gooey, allowing the eyelids to move apart, and leaving behind a sticky residue. This leaves the cornea exposed to epithelial drying and/or abrasions, sometimes caused by the tape that was originally applied to protect the cornea. Alternatively, the <b>adhesive</b> <b>strength</b> may increase, which upon removal can result in eyelid bruising, tears, or eyelash removal.|$|E

The {{aim of this}} work was {{the improvement of the}} polymer surface polarity in order to replace the use of adhesive layers before application of lacquering. Two different concepts of dielectric barrier discharge, direct and indirect plasma treatment, were applied. The efficiency of such plasma treatment was determined by <b>adhesive</b> pull <b>strength</b> tests and surface energy calculations. It was shown that both plasma treatment methods allow a significant increase in surface polarity up to a factor of 20 and <b>adhesive</b> pull <b>strength</b> of lacquers up to a factor of 29 respectively.

50|$|Typical {{epoxy resins}} have pendant {{hydroxyl}} (- OH) groups along their chain that can form bonds or strong polar attractions to oxide or hydroxyl surfaces. Most inorganic surfaces—i.e., metals, minerals, glasses, ceramics—have polarity {{so they have}} high surface energy.

50|$|Sometimes {{grouped into}} the {{chemical}} mechanism of adhesion, hydrogen bonding can increase <b>adhesive</b> <b>strength</b> by the dispersive mechanism.

This bond is naturally polar, with the hydrogen atom gaining a slight positive charge and the other atom becoming slightly negative. Two molecules, or even two functional groups on one large molecule, may then be attracted to each other via Keesom forces.|$|E

30|$|A Missouri Department of Transportation report (Myers et al. 2010) on {{structural}} steel coatings for corrosion mitigation mentions that drainage {{of water from}} the deck onto the superstructure was the primary factor leading to service failures of the coating. It was reported that inorganic zinc primers were effective at hindering corrosion; however, organic zinc primer had higher <b>adhesive</b> <b>strengths.</b> The document also reported that overcoating provides an alternative maintenance option that reduces cost and disruption of the highway system; however, it comes with an increased level of risk of early failure of the newly applied system (as opposed to the full blast and repaint approach). Additionally, polyurea type coatings were reported to be effective at producing bond strength, but the salt-induced corrosion inhibition was not as strong as the systems with a high solid zinc primer. Organic zinc primer was reported to be more effective due to higher <b>adhesive</b> <b>strengths</b> and a lower probability of the primer peeling off. A promising review of the application of micaceous iron oxide zinc primer with aliphatic polyurea polyaspartic topcoat system was reported to have almost equal performance in terms of salt-fog resistance when compared to blast cleaning and application of a zinc rich primer. It also provided the added feature of superior UV resistance with good freeze–thaw stability.|$|R

Combined effect of relatively high temperature and moisture on bond strength of titanium samples and only high temperature dry aged samples are studied.
