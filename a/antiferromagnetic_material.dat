2500|$|Although {{ferromagnetism}} {{is responsible}} for most of the effects of magnetism encountered in everyday life, all other materials are influenced to some extent by a magnetic field, by several other types of magnetism. Paramagnetic substances such as aluminum and oxygen are weakly attracted to an applied magnetic field; [...] diamagnetic substances such as copper and carbon are weakly repelled; while <b>antiferromagnetic</b> <b>materials</b> such as chromium and spin glasses have a more complex relationship with a magnetic field. [...] The force of a magnet on paramagnetic, diamagnetic, <b>antiferromagnetic</b> <b>materials</b> is usually too weak to be felt, and can be detected only by laboratory instruments, so in everyday life these substances are often described as non-magnetic.|$|R

Intense research efforts {{over the past decade}} have been invested in unraveling spin transport properties in <b>antiferromagnetic</b> <b>materials.</b> Whether spin transport can be used to drive the antiferromagnetic order and how subsequent variations can be detected are some of the thrilling challenges currently being addressed. Antiferromagnetic spintronics started out with studies on spin transfer, and has undergone a definite revival {{in the last few years}} with the publication of pioneering articles on the use of spin-orbit interactions in antiferromagnets. This paradigm shift offers possibilities for radically new concepts for spin manipulation in electronics. Central to these endeavors are the need for predictive models, relevant disruptive materials and new experimental designs.

40|$|Most of the {{magnetic}} devices in advanced electronics rely on the exchange bias effect, a magnetic interaction that couples a ferromagnetic and an <b>antiferromagnetic</b> <b>material,</b> resulting in a unidirectional displacement of the ferromagnetic hysteresis loop by an amount called the 'exchange bias field'. Setting and optimizing exchange bias involves cooling through the Néel temperature of the <b>antiferromagnetic</b> <b>material</b> {{in the presence of}} a magnetic field. Here we demonstrate an alternative process for the generation of exchange bias. In IrMn/FeCo bilayers, a structural phase transition in the IrMn layer develops at room temperature, exchange biasing the FeCo layer as it propagates. Once the process is completed, the IrMn layer contains very large single-crystal grains, with a large density of structural defects within each grain, which are promoted by the FeCo layer. The magnetic characterization indicates that these structural defects in the antiferromagnetic layer are behind the resulting large value of the exchange bias field and its good thermal stability. This mechanism for establishing the exchange bias in such a system can contribute towards the clarification of fundamental aspects of this exchange interaction...|$|E
