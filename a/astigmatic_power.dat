40|$|PURPOSE: To {{examine the}} effect of {{uncorrected}} astigmatism in older adults. SETTING: University Vision Clinic METHOD: Twenty-one healthy presbyopes, aged 58. 9 ± 2. 8 years, had astigmatism of 0. 0 to - 4. 0 x 90 ?DC and - 3. 0 DC of cylinder at 90 ?, 180 ? and 45 ? induced with spectacle lenses, with the mean spherical equivalent compensated to plano, in random order. Visual acuity was assessed binocularly using a computerised test chart at 95 %, 50 % and 10 % contrast. Near acuity and reading speed were measured using standardised reading texts. Light scatter was quantified with the cQuant and driving reaction times with a computer simulator. Finally visual clarity of a mobile phone and computer screen was subjectively rated. RESULTS: Distance visual acuity decreased with increasing uncorrected <b>astigmatic</b> <b>power</b> (F= 174. 50, p 0. 05), but the reliability and variability of measurements decreased with increasing uncorrected <b>astigmatic</b> <b>power</b> (p 0. 05), but subjective rating of clarity decreased with increasing uncorrected <b>astigmatic</b> <b>power</b> (p< 0. 001). Uncorrected astigmatism at 45 ? or 180 ? orientation resulted in a worse distance and near visual acuity, and subjective rated clarity than 90 ? orientation (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Uncorrected astigmatism, even as low as 1. 0 DC, causes a significant burden on a patient’s vision. If left uncorrected, this could impact significantly on their independence, quality of life and wellbeing...|$|E
40|$|Background: Changes in {{refraction}} follow {{surgery on}} the extraocular muscles. We examined corneal topography {{before and after}} medial or lateral rectus muscle recession using a computer-assisted topographic analysis system. Methods: A total of 36 patients (52 eyes) were examined. Measurements were taken 1 day before surgery and 1, 15, and 30 days after surgery. Results: A significant change in <b>astigmatic</b> <b>power</b> was detected 1 day after surgery in the meridian of the recessed muscle, evidencing a localized flattening of the cornea. Induced astigmatism decreased over time. At 30 days following surgery, 6 % of patients evidenced a residual change higher than 1 diopter (D); 12 % evidenced a residual change higher than 0. 5 D. Conclusion: The increase of <b>astigmatic</b> <b>power</b> recorded 1 day after surgery is higher for medial rectus muscle recession than for lateral rectus muscle recession. Corneal topography changes, located mainly in the meridian of the recessed muscle and the optical zone, are greatly reduced or gone within 1 month of surgery...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the correlation of}} the magnitude of corneal toricity and power vector components of both corneal surfaces measured with a Scheimpflug photography-based system. Methods: A total of 117 healthy normal eyes of 117 subjects selected randomly with ages ranging from 7 to 80 years were included. All eyes received an anterior segment and corneal analysis with the Sirius system (CSO) evaluating the anterior and posterior mean toricity for 3 and 7 mm (aAST and pAST). The vector components J 0 and J 45 as well as the overall strength blur (B) were calculated for each keratometric measurement using the procedure defined by Thibos and Horner. Results: The coefficient of correlation between aAST and pAST was 0. 52 and 0. 62 and the mean anteroposterior ratio for toricity was 0. 46 ± 0. 39 and 0. 57 ± 0. 75 for 3 and 7 mm, respectively. These ratios correlated significantly with aAST, anterior corneal J 0, and manifest refraction J 0 (r ≥ 0. 39, P < 0. 01). The coefficient of correlation was 0. 69 and 0. 81 between anterior and posterior J 0 for 3 and 7 mm, respectively. For J 45, the coefficients were 0. 62 and 0. 71, respectively. The linear regression analysis revealed that the pAST and power vectors could be predicted from the anterior corneal data (R 2 ≥ 0. 40, P < 0. 01). Conclusions: The toricity and <b>astigmatic</b> <b>power</b> vector components of the posterior corneal surface in the human healthy eye are related to those of the anterior and therefore can be predicted consistently from the anterior toricity and <b>astigmatic</b> <b>power</b> vectors...|$|E

40|$|By the mid- 40 s, the {{amplitude}} of accommodation has declined sufficiently so {{that most of}} us can no longer accommodate clearly and comfortably for close tasks. This condition, called presbyopia, is related to the growth of the lens. Nowadays, due {{to the development of the}} free-form technologies, the progressive addition lenses (PAL) are the best solution for the presbyopia. To obtain the necessary optical properties, a continuous change in the curvature along a line (called corridor) must be provided on a surface of the lens (progressive surface).

Setting: General Hospital of Piraeus “Tzaneio”, Attiki, Greece. Materials and methods: A total of 333 eyes with corneal astigmatism ≤ 1. 5 diopters (D) underwent cataract surgery. A three-step superotemporal clear corneal incision for the right eye and a superonasal clear corneal incision for the left eye (3. 0 mm) was made, while the sideport incision was located at 110 °. Keratometric data were measured with corneal topography EyeSys Vista 2000 pre- and postoperatively at the 1 st and 6 th month. Surgically induced astigmatism was calculated by vector analysis. We noted all cases in which a change > 0. 5 D in corneal <b>astigmatic</b> <b>power</b> occurred, {{as well as a}} change > 20 ° in axis torque, despite axis direction. Results: After multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted, cases with > 110 ° distance between the tunnel and sideport incision had 2. 22 times (P= 0. 021) greater likelihood for having changed > 0. 5 D in <b>astigmatic</b> <b>power</b> at the 1 st month and 3. 45 times (P= 0. 031) at the 6 th month postoperatively, as compared with cases with a 90 °– 110 ° distance between the tunnel and sideport incision. As for the change in the astigmatic axis, cases with 20 ° (P< 0. 001) (preoperative to 1 st month) as compared with cases having 90 °– 110 ° of distance. Conclusion: For surgeons that operate only from the superior position, we propose that in order to produce an incision that is as “astigmatically neutral” as possible, they should perform the sideport incision at a 90 °– 110 ° distance.

40|$|Purpose The {{primary goal}} is to {{evaluate}} the effect of Neodymium:YAG (Nd:YAG) laser posterior capsulotomy for posterior capsule opacification (PCO) on refraction in multifocal apodized diffractive pseudophakia. The secondary goal is {{the evaluation of the}} correlation between automated and subjective refraction in this type of multifocal lenses. Setting: Combined private refractive surgery clinic, Retina Total Eye Care in Driebergen, and tertiary care ophthalmology clinic at the Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Methods: This retrospective chart review comprised 75 pseudophakic eyes (55 consecutive patients) with a SN 6 AD 1 or SN 6 AD 3 IOL after cataract surgery or refractive lens exchange, treated for posterior capsule opacification with Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy. Values of monocular uncorrected distance acuity (UCDA), monocular corrected distance acuity (CDVA), spherical equivalent (SE), defocus equivalent (DE), <b>astigmatic</b> <b>power</b> vectors J 0 and J 45 and overall blurring strength (B) after Nd:YAG posterior capsulotomy were compared with values of before the intervention. The amount of energy used during Nd:YAG posterior capsulotomy and the severity of PCO were evaluated to determine correlation with change in refraction. Values of autorefraction were compared with those of subjective refraction to determine the correlation between the two methods. Results: Visual acuity improved statistically significant in both UDVA and CDVA (P 0, 5 D in subjective refraction. Of those eyes, 3 eyes (5, 5 %) had a deterioration of the refractive error. The amount of energy used during Nd:YAG posterior capsulotomy shows to have a very weak (J 45 rho=- 0. 29, P= 0. 033) or no effect (P> 0. 05 for SE, DE, J 0 and B) on subsequent lens movement. The severity of PCO is not related to changes in refraction (P> 0. 05). Autorefraction and subjective refraction are highly correlated in SE, DE and B (r 2 > 0. 59), but are weakly correlated in J 0 and J 45 (r 2 0, 5 D in subjective refraction occurs.

40|$|Abstract. The {{need for}} {{affordable}} and sustainable ophthalmic systems for measurement and correction of refraction is well recognized. Power-adjustable spectacles {{based on the}} Alvarez principle (transversal lateral movement of two lenses) have emerged as an innovative technology for this purpose. Within this framework, our aim is to design a new power-adjustable sphero-cylindrical refractor. The system is comprised of two lenses and three independent lateral movements. The lenses have a pla-nar and a third-degree polynomial surface. They are arranged with their planar surfaces in contact, so that the incoming light is only refracted by two surfaces. First, we present the theory of such a system. Second, we propose an optical design methodology. Third, we provide a design example capable of measuring sphere powers ranging from − 5. 00 D to þ 5. 00 D and cross-cylinders from − 2. 00 D to 2. 00 D. Finally, a prototype of the lenses was manufactured using free-form machining. © 2013 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) [DOI: 10. 1117 / 1.

METHODS: This case series prospectively assessed 62 eyes of 31 consecutive cataract patients with preoperative corneal astigmatism between 0. 75 and 2. 50 diopters in both eyes. Patients were randomly assorted among two phacoemulsification groups: one assigned to receive AcrySof®Toric intraocular lens (IOL) in both eyes and another assigned to have AcrySof Natural IOL associated with limbal relaxing incisions, also in both eyes. All patients were reevaluated postoperatively at 6 months, when refractive astigmatism analysis was performed using both Alpins and Thibos methods. The ratio between Thibos postoperative APV and preoperative APV (APVratio) and its linear regression to Alpins percentage of success of astigmatic surgery, percentage of astigmatism corrected and percentage of astigmatism reduction at the intended axis were assessed.

MethodsWe measured 276 subjects with optical compensation prior to the development of cataract. We evaluated 224 eyes with nuclear cataract, 125 with cortical cataract, and 103 with posterior subcapsular (PSC) cataract classified with LOCSIII. We measured visual acuity (VA) with their spectacles and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) with chart in decimal scale to obtain the optimal compensation with cataract. We evaluated the differences between compensations. ResultsA significant myopic shift was observed in nuclear cataract from low to mild grade (p= 0. 031), the same as for PSC cataract from mild to advanced grade (p= 0. 025). No significant changes were found for cortical cataract (p= 0. 462).

40|$|Manoj Motwani Motwani LASIK Institute, San Diego, CA, USA Purpose: To {{demonstrate}} how using the Wavelight Contoura measured astigmatism and axis eliminates corneal astigmatism and creates uniformly shaped corneas. Patients and methods: A retrospective {{analysis was conducted}} of the first 50 eyes to have bilateral full WaveLight® Contoura LASIK correction of measured astigmatism and axis (vs conventional manifest refraction), using the Layer Yolked Reduction of Astigmatism Protocol in all cases. All patients had astigmatism corrected, and had at least 1 week of follow-up. Accuracy to desired refractive goal was assessed by postoperative refraction, aberration reduction via calculation of polynomials, and postoperative visions were analyzed as a secondary goal. Results: The average difference of <b>astigmatic</b> <b>power</b> from manifest to measured was 0. 5462 D (with a range of 0 – 1. 69 D), and the average difference of axis was 14. 94 ° (with a range of 0 °– 89 °). Forty-seven of 50 eyes had a goal of plano, 3 had a monovision goal. Astigmatism was fully eliminated from all but 2 eyes, and 1 eye had regression with astigmatism. Of the eyes with plano as the goal, 80. 85 % were 20 / 15 or better, and 100 % were 20 / 20 or better. Polynomial analysis postoperatively showed that at 6. 5 mm, the average C 3 was reduced by 86. 5 % and the average C 5 by 85. 14 %.

Methods The accommodative response of each eye of sixteen young isometropic adults (mean age 22 ± 2 years) with normal binocular vision was measured using an open-field autorefractor during a range of testing conditions; monocularly (accommodative demands ranging from 1. 32 to 4. 55 D) and binocularly while altering the accommodation demand for each eye (aniso-accommodative stimuli ranging from 0. 24 to 2. 05 D). Results Under monocular viewing conditions, the dominant and non-dominant eyes displayed a highly symmetric accommodative response; mean interocular difference in spherical equivalent 0. 01 ± 0. 06 D (relative) and 0. 22 ± 0. 06 D (absolute) (p> 0. 05). During binocular viewing, the dominant eye displayed a greater accommodative response (0. 11 ± 0. 34 D relative and 0. 24 ± 0. 26 D absolute) irrespective of whether the demand of the dominant or non-dominant eye was altered (p = 0. 01). <b>Astigmatic</b> <b>power</b> vectors J 0 and J 45 did not vary between eyes or with increasing accommodation demands under monocular or binocular viewing conditions (p> 0. 05). Conclusion The dominant and non-dominant eyes of young isometropic individuals display a similar consensual lag of accommodation under both monocular and binocular viewing conditions, with the dominant eye showing a small but significantly greater (by 0. 12 to 0. 25 D) accommodative response. Evidence of short-term aniso-accommodation in response to asymmetric accommodation demands was not observed...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the characteristics of}} macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thickness profiles associated with ocular dominance. Private practice, Seoul, Republic of Korea. Comparative case-control study. Both eyes of 199 participants with no ophthalmic abnormalities were included. Participants were imaged by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, and underwent dominant eye testing using a hole-in-a-card test (sighting dominance) at the same visit. Macular GCIPL, as well as circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness were compared for individual patients, according to ocular dominance. Ocular dominance occurred predominantly in the right eye (right vs. left: 72. 36 vs. 27. 60 %; P < 0. 001). In the comparison of macular GCIPL thickness, the average (81. 27 ± 5. 01 μm vs. 80. 66 ± 6. 31 μm in dominant vs. non-dominant eyes), inferonasal (81. 39 ± 5. 47 μm vs. 80. 33 ± 6. 82 μm, and inferior sectors (77. 95 ± 6. 05 μm vs. 76. 97 ± 8. 15 μm) were significantly different between dominant and non-dominant eyes (P = 0. 040, 0. 005, and 0. 032, respectively). Significant predictors of average GCIPL thickness were spherical equivalent (β = 1. 37, P< 0. 001), <b>astigmatic</b> <b>power</b> (β = 1. 44, P = 0. 009), disc area (β = 3. 90, P < 0. 001), average RNFL thickness (β = 0. 22, P< 0. 001), average cup-to-disc ratio (β = 5. 74, P = 0. 002), difference between the inferior and superior quadrant RNFL thicknesses (β = 0. 08, P = 0. 024), and ocular dominance (β = 2. 10, P = 0. 020). On multivariate regression analysis, ocular dominance was correlated with average GCIPL thickness after adjusting for potential confounders (β = 1. 63, P = 0. 048). Dominant eyes accompanied significantly thicker average macular GCIPL. This information suggests that macular GCIPL thickness may provide {{an indicator of the}} relative dominance of an eye...|$|E
40|$|Anastasios John Kanellopoulos 1, 2 1 LaserVision Clinical and Research Institute, Athens, Greece; 2 Department of Ophthalmology, NYU Medical School, New York, NY, USA Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the safety, efficacy, and contralateral eye comparison of topography-guided myopic LASIK with two different refraction treatment strategies. Setting: Private clinical ophthalmology practice. Patients and methods: A total of 100 eyes (50 patients) in consecutive cases of myopic topography-guided LASIK procedures {{with the same}} refractive platform (FS 200 femtosecond and EX 500 excimer lasers) were randomized for treatment as follows: one eye with the standard clinical refraction (group A) and the contralateral eye with the topographic <b>astigmatic</b> <b>power</b> and axis (topography-modified treatment refraction; group B). All cases were evaluated pre- and post-operatively for the following parameters: refractive error, best corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), topography (Placido-disk based) and tomography (Scheimpflug-image based), wavefront analysis, pupillometry, and contrast sensitivity. Follow-up visits were conducted for at least 12  months. Results: Mean refractive error was - 5. 5  D of myopia and - 1. 75  D of astigmatism. In group A versus group B, respectively, the average UDVA improved from 20 / 200 to 20 / 20 versus 20 / 16; post-operative CDVA was 20 / 20 and 20 / 13. 5; 1 line of vision gained was 27. 8 % and 55. 6 %; and 2 lines of vision gained was 5. 6 % and 11. 1 %. In group A, 27. 8 % of eyes had over - 0. 50 diopters of residual refractive astigmatism, in comparison to 11. 7 % in group B (P< 0. 01). The residual percentages in both groups were measured with refractive astigmatism of more than – 0. 5 diopters. Conclusion: Topography-modified refraction (TMR) : topographic adjustment of the amount and axis of astigmatism treated, when different from the clinical refraction, may offer superior outcomes in topography-guided myopic LASIK. These findings may change the current clinical paradigm of the optimal subjective refraction utilized in laser vision correction.
