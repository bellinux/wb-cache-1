5|$|Tuberculosis {{prevention}} and control efforts rely {{primarily on the}} vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases. The World Health Organization has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening people who <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> for latent tuberculosis with either tuberculin skin tests or interferon-gamma release assays.|$|E
5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is {{definitively}} diagnosed from tissue, i.e. it {{is proven}} by biopsy or examination of the tissue excised at surgery. It may be suspected in a patient with obstructive jaundice. Considering it as the working diagnosis may be challenging in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC); such patients <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> of developing cholangiocarcinoma, but the symptoms {{may be difficult to}} distinguish from those of PSC. Furthermore, in patients with PSC, such diagnostic clues as a visible mass on imaging or biliary ductal dilatation may not be evident.|$|E

25|$|Anthrax {{vaccination}} {{is recommended}} for people who <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk.</b> Immunizing animals against anthrax is recommended in areas where previous infections have occurred. Two months of antibiotics, such as doxycycline or ciprofloxacin, after exposure can also prevent infection.|$|E

25|$|Patients with {{diabetes}} <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> of developing {{coronary heart disease}} and usually have related conditions that make their treatment regimens even more complex. These related conditions, such as hypertension, obesity and depression are also characterised by poor rates of adherence, and therefore exacerbate treatment outcomes.|$|E

25|$|Estrogen {{replacement}} therapy {{such as the}} birth control pill, has been used since the condition was described in 1938 to promote development of secondary sexual characteristics.
