50|$|Polyethylene adipate (or PEA), is an {{aliphatic}} polyester {{formed from}} polyethylene glycol and adipic acid.

5000|$|To date, {{there have}} been several types of Copper Nitrite Reductases discovered. [...] These CuNIR are found in many {{different}} fungi and bacteria; for example, the bacterial genera Pseudomonas, Bordetella, Alcaligenes, and <b>Achromobacter</b> all contain CuNIR. [...] What is common to all CuNIR is the presence of at least one type 1 copper center in the protein. These centers are similar to Azurin in their bonding structure. Each type 1 Cu is strongly bonded to a thiolate sulfur from a cysteine, two imidazole nitrogens from different Histidine residues, and a sulfur atom of an axial Methionine ligand. This induces a distorted tetrahedral molecular geometry.|$|E
50|$|While {{nitrogen}} fixation converts nitrogen {{from the atmosphere}} into organic compounds, a series of processes called denitrification returns an approximately equal amount of nitrogen to the atmosphere. Denitrifying bacteria tend to be anaerobes, or facultatively anaerobes (can alter between the oxygen dependent and oxygen independent types of metabolisms), including <b>Achromobacter</b> and Pseudomonas. The purification process caused by oxygen-free conditions converts nitrates and nitrites in soil into nitrogen gas or into gaseous compounds such as nitrous oxide or nitric oxide. In excess, denitrification canlead to overall losses of available soil nitrogen and subsequent loss of soil fertility. However, fixed nitrogen may circulate many times between organisms and the soilbefore denitrification returns it to the atmosphere. The diagram above illustrates the nitrogen cycle.|$|E
40|$|The {{phenotypic}} and genotypic {{characteristics of}} a historical collection of strains identified as <b>Achromobacter</b> denitrificans were examined. Sequence analysis of a 765 bp nrdA gene fragment revealed that eight of these strains belonged to the recently described <b>Achromobacter</b> aegrifaciens, <b>Achromobacter</b> mucicolens, and <b>Achromobacter</b> insolitus, and that one strain belonged to <b>Achromobacter</b> xylosoxidans. The analysis also suggested the presence of four novel species of the genus <b>Achromobacter</b> among the remaining strains. The latter was confirmed by multilocus sequence analysis of concatenated nusA, eno, rpoB, gltB, lepA, nuoL and nrdA gene fragments and extensive genotypic and phenotypic characterization. We propose to name these novel species as <b>Achromobacter</b> agilis sp. nov., nom. rev. (type strain LMG 3411 (T) =CCUG 62454 (T)), <b>Achromobacter</b> pestifer sp. nov., nom. rev.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundWe {{recently}} {{described a}} multilocus sequence typing scheme for <b>Achromobacter</b> that identified several novel species in this genus. MethodsWe assessed {{the ability of}} nrdA sequence analysis to differentiate <b>Achromobacter</b> species, including the seven previously named species and 14 recently described genogroups. Confirmation of distinctness between groups was confirmed using the k parameter. Using this single locus sequence to differentiate species, we analyzed <b>Achromobacter</b> isolates obtained from 341 CF patients in the U. S. ResultsWe found that <b>Achromobacter</b> xylosoxidans accounts for 42 % of <b>Achromobacter</b> infections, while <b>Achromobacter</b> ruhlandii accounted for 23. 5 % of infections. Isolates from 17 % of patients {{were members of the}} novel genogroup 14. The remaining 17. 5 % of strains belonged to 11 other species/genogroups. ConclusionThe use of nrdA sequence analysis allows differentiation of the several <b>Achromobacter</b> species that can infect persons with CF. <b>Achromobacter</b> species other than A. xylosoxidans account for the majority of <b>Achromobacter</b> infection in CF patients in the U. S...|$|E

40|$|<b>Achromobacter</b> spp. are {{emerging}} respiratory pathogens in cystic fibrosis patients.

Nevertheless, some <b>Achromobacter</b> spp. strains are susceptible to AG. This study including 49 <b>Achromobacter</b> isolates reveals that AG resistance is correlated with different <b>Achromobacter</b> spp. It is noteworthy that the axyXY-oprZ operon is detected only in AG-resistant species, including the most frequently encountered in cystic fibrosis patients: A.

40|$|Amultilocus {{sequence}} analysis (MLSA) scheme {{was developed for}} characterization of strains and species from the genus Achro-mobacter, which are increasingly recovered from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Five conserved housekeeping genes were se-lected for the MLSA, which was applied to a diverse collection of 77 strains originating from Europe, Asia, and South America and including type strains of the seven recognized <b>Achromobacter</b> species, six environmental strains, eight non-CF clinical strains, and 56 CF clinical strains. The discriminatory power of MLSA, based on 2, 098 nucleotides (nt), was much superior to a 16 S rRNA gene comparison based on 1, 309 nt. Congruence was observed between single-gene trees and a concatenated gene tree. MLSA differentiated all seven current <b>Achromobacter</b> species and also demonstrated the presence of at least four novel potential species within the genus. CF isolates were predominantly <b>Achromobacter</b> xylosoxidans (64 %), an undescribed <b>Achromobacter</b> species (18 %), and <b>Achromobacter</b> ruhlandii (7 %). A clone of <b>Achromobacter,</b> which has spread among patients fromDanish CF centers in Aarhus and Copenhagen, was identified as <b>Achromobacter</b> ruhlandii. MLSA facilitates the specific identification of isolates of <b>Achromobacter</b> necessary for describing their role in clinical infections. <b>Achromobacter</b> xylosoxidans is an aerobic, Gram-negative bacil-lus found {{in a variety of}} aquatic environments such as moist soil (3), well water (29), and swimming pools (24) and also in chlorhexidine (38) and dialysis solutions (24). The bacterium has proved able to survive on inanimate surfaces in hospital setting...|$|E
