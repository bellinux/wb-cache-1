6000|$|April 22nd {{convinced}} us that, even {{in these}} prosaic regions, our misadventures and accidents had not reached their fated end. A special train had been organized by Hanafi Effendi for eight a.m. About ten miles from Suez one of the third-class carriages began [...] "running hot;" [...] and, before we could dismount, the <b>axle-box</b> of a truck became a young Vesuvius {{in the matter of}} vomiting smoke. I ordered the driver, who was driving furiously, to make half speed; but even with this precaution there were sundry stoppages; and at the Naffíshah station, where my Bolognese acquaintances still throve, we could not be supplied with a change of [...] "rolling-stock." [...] About Tell el-Kabír, the brake-van also waxed unsafely warm; but it reached Zagázig without developing more caloric. Briefly, we caught fire three times in one morning.|$|E
50|$|Midland Railway {{locomotives}} were {{notorious for}} their short <b>axle-box</b> bearings, which were prone to overheating. This design feature was perpetuated in the LMS 4F. The problem was eventually solved with the fitting of mechanical lubricators.|$|E
50|$|Pairs of {{tapered roller}} {{bearings}} are used in car and vehicle wheel bearings where they must cope simultaneously with large vertical (radial) and horizontal (axial) forces. Tapered roller bearings are commonly used for moderate speed, heavy duty applications where durability is required. Common real world applications are in agriculture, construction and mining equipment, axle systems, gear box, engine motors and reducers, propeller shaft, railroad <b>axle-box,</b> differential, wind turbines, etc.|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{deals with}} {{the identification of the}} running-state of railway wheelsets by means of accelerations measured at the <b>axle-boxes.</b> The interaction between rail and wheel causes rigid-body motions as well as structural vibrations. First of all accelerations are decomposed into their symmetric and antimetric components, followed by a time frequency analysis using the short-time Fourier transform. Simulations and experiments on a full-scale test rig underline the potentials of this approach for the identification of the wheelset's bending modes. The torsional modes cannot be directly observed at the <b>axle-boxes,</b> they have to be estimated by the dynamic interaction between the wheelset's yawing and lateral motion...|$|R
50|$|In another {{departure}} from the small engine policy, several 2-6-0+0-6-2 Beyer-Garratts were acquired for the Toton-Brent coal trains but interference from Derby saw these receive standard small <b>axle-boxes</b> and short-travel valves {{with the result that}} they were poor performers.|$|R
50|$|The frames, {{on display}} at the Severn Valley Railway, are now in an {{advanced}} state. Further parts and patterns continue to be amassed with wheels and <b>axle-boxes</b> cast and cylinders on order. With construction work on the new engine advancing every week the Trust classifies 82045 as the 1001st steam locomotive to a BR Standard design since the commencement of its construction follows that of 72010 Hengist.|$|R
50|$|The S160's were {{designed}} for quick and efficient building, not long-term operations, thus compromises in design led to some difficulties in operation. The <b>axle-box</b> grease-lubricators were not very efficient, particularly when maintenance procedures lapsed or were delayed for operational war reasons, and so axle-boxes often ran hot. Braking was poor by European standards, with a Westinghouse steam brake used for the locomotive, which was woefully insufficient, due to the long distance from the driver's valve to the brake cylinder.|$|E
5000|$|They had a {{whole range}} of {{features}} such as piston valves, roller-type big-end and side-rod bearings, manganese steel <b>axle-box</b> and horn plate liners, hopper ashpans, self-cleaning smokeboxes, rocking grates and Lambets wet sanding. Steel fireboxes were used as well as [...] "Owens" [...] patent poppet valve and balanced regulator valves. As was usual for short-journey locomotives they were not fitted with superheating, as short journeys allow little time for the superheater elements to reach working temperature.|$|E
5000|$|After {{loss of the}} Cornish and Welsh {{contracts}} in 1981, {{it was also the}} last year that operational use was made of milk tank wagons in the United Kingdom. Using refurbished two- and three-axle wagons, the MMB had newly manufactured 5 ft diameter aluminium milk tanks chain-anchored to the chassis. Painted in MMB blue, they were mounted on a black chassis with black chains, all white lettering and orange <b>axle-box</b> covers. Given the TOPS code TRV, they operated on the short-lived [...] to Stowmarket service for less than a year. After the contract was cancelled, the MMB kept the refurbished milk tank wagons in store on their own premises to overcome any difficulties in road transport, before disposing of the entire fleet five years later.|$|E
40|$|The {{failure of}} {{axle-bearing}} {{is one of}} the most common causes of derailments of railway vehicles which are usually accompanied by huge material damage and human casualties. Modern railways are working intensively on the development and implementation of appropriate systems for early detection of axlebearing malfunctions, which are typically manifested by increasing of its temperature. The most common approach is based on the use of wayside systems or checkpoints located in certain places along the track. There is also an innovative approach that involves using the system for continuous measuring and online monitoring of <b>axle-boxes</b> temperature. The main aim is to provide early detection of malfunctions of the axle-bearing and prevention of the potential derailment. This paper analyses the existing solutions for the detection of axle-bearings malfunctions with special emphasis on the working principle and the main advantages and disadvantages. The paper presents the basics of the one newly developed wireless measuring system for on-line monitoring of <b>axle-boxes</b> temperature. The measuring system was tested in real conditions and can be successfully applied to the commercial railway vehicles. The main conclusion is that systems for on-line monitoring of axle-bearings temperatures are far more efficient than wayside systems. Obtained results may be important for those who deal with these and similar problems, problems of development, exploitation and maintenance of railway vehicles, strategies, regulations, etc...|$|R
50|$|The train {{consisted}} of engine and tender, five carriages, two post office vans, and two brake vans. It left Darlington at 8.25 pm, and after about 4 mi, and moving at 40 mph towards Dalton Road bridge, the driver {{felt a sudden}} shock {{at the back of}} the engine. On looking around, he saw fire flying from the tender, and shut off the steam. The fireman couldn’t apply the tender brake since the step to the brake had broken in the incident. The driver whistled for the guard's brakes, but did not reverse the engine for fear of damage to the carriages behind. The engine came to a dead stop in 220 yards from the point of alarm, and both guards and firemen went to the nearest stations to alert any oncoming trains of the blockage to the line. The engine was fine, but the tender had lost both leading wheels, axle and <b>axle-boxes,</b> although was upright with the other four wheels intact, but off the rails. Most of the following vehicles were more or less damaged and off the track, damage being mainly confined to the wheel assemblies, but injuries were minimal, with only one passenger complaining. Six post-office clerks were “considerably shaken”.|$|R
6000|$|Is it wholly impossible, then, for men of {{mechanical}} experience and large sympathies {{to check the}} mere patent-hunter and bring forward the man with an idea? Is there no supervision in the [...] "shops," [...] or have the men who play tennis and billiards at the institute not a minute which they can rightly call their very own? Would it ruin the richest Company in India to lend their model-shop and their lathes to half a dozen, or, for the matter of that, half a hundred, abortive experiments? A Massachusetts organ factory, a Racine buggy shop, an Oregon lumber-yard, would laugh at the notion. An American toy-maker might swindle an employé after the invention, but he would in his own interests help the man to [...] "see what comes of the thing." [...] Surely a wealthy, a powerful and, as all Jamalpur bears witness, a considerate Company might cut that clause out of the covenant and await the issue. There would be quite enough jealousy between man and man, grade and grade, to keep down all but the keenest souls; and, with due respect to the steam-hammer and the rolling-mill, {{we have not yet}} made machinery perfect. The [...] "shops" [...] are not likely to spawn unmanageable Stephensons or grasping Brunels; but in the minor turns {{of mechanical}} thought that find concrete expressions in links, <b>axle-boxes,</b> joint packings, valves, and spring-stirrups something might--something would--be done were the practical prohibition removed. Will a North countryman give you anything but warm hospitality for nothing? Or if you claim from him overtime service as a right, will he work zealously? [...] "Onything but t' brass," [...] is his motto, and his ideas are his [...] "brass." ...|$|R
50|$|Confusingly, one of {{the first}} railway {{companies}} to use his <b>axle-box</b> design widely was the London and South Western Railway where the Locomotive Superintendent, the creator of the Adams Bogie, was also named William Adams. By further coincidence he too had formerly operated a locomotive works in Bow, but this was not a private concern but the depot of the North London Railway. In 1865 the Society of Engineers, London, made direct comparison between the bogie with the india-rubber lateral bearing of William Adams and the radial axle box of William Bridges Adams: during trials on the North London Railway the laterally sprung bogie was thought superior to the radial axle, but when William Adams moved to the LSWR he adopted the axle box designed by his rival Bridges Adams. The locomotives now known as Adams Radials are named after the Locomotive Superintendent, but they are famous for the axle invented by William Bridges Adams.|$|E
5000|$|As {{mentioned}} in the previous paragraph The Victor/Vulcan 2994-6 locomotives were ordered by the Steel Company of Wales (SCOW) for their Abbey, Margam and Port Talbot works in 1950. They had {{a whole range of}} such as 18" [...] X 26" [...] cylinders, together with piston valves, roller-type big-end and side-rod bearings, manganese steel <b>axle-box</b> and horn plate liners, hopper ashpans, self-cleaning smokeboxes, rocking grates and Lambets wet sanding. Steel fireboxes were used as well as [...] "Owens" [...] patent poppet valve and balanced regulator valves. surprisingly the locomotives wasn't fitted with superheating and although the locomotives were powerful they weren't the most powerful as the Peckett OQ Class with 29,527 lbf of tractive effort was the most powerful while the 2994-6 locomotives only had 25,250 lbs of tractive effort. In later life 2994 and 2996 were sold to Austin Motor company and were named 'Victor' and 'Vulcan' [...] They ran until 1972 when the locos were preserved on the West Somerset Railway and currently run at the Stephenson Railway Museum and the Lakeside and Haverthwaite Railway. 2995 was sold to NCB at the same time for use at a colliery and was scrapped in 1967.|$|E
5000|$|Bouch {{pointed to}} the rails and their chairs being smashed up in the girder holding the last 2 {{carriage}}s, to the <b>axle-box</b> of the second-class carriage having become detached and ending up in the bottom boom of the eastern girder, to the footboard {{on the east side}} of the carriage having been completely carried away, to the girders being broken up, and to marks on the girders showing contact with the carriage roof, and to a plank with wheel marks on it having been washed up at Newport but unfortunately then washed away. [...] Bouch's assistant gave evidence of two sets of horizontal scrape marks (very slight scratches in the metal or paint on the girders) matching the heights of the roofs of the last two carriages, but did not know the heights he claimed to be matched. At the start of one of these abrasions, a rivet head had lifted and splinters of wood were lodged between a tie bar and a cover plate. Evidence was then given of flange marks on tie bars in the fifth girder (north of the two rearmost carriages), the 'collision with girders' theory being duly modified to everything behind the tender having derailed.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Lack of {{kinematics}} {{models and}} imperfection {{of the known}} dynamics models of the roller bearings of railway rolling stock <b>axle-boxes</b> do not allow designing the optimal structure of bearing cages, providing the required service life and reliability of bearing units of wheel sets for cars and locomotives. The studies of kinematics and dynamics of roller bearings of axle boxes for cars and locomotives and modeling of their parts interaction to create the analytical method of bearing cages calculation are necessary. Methodology. This purpose has been achieved due to the modeling of kinematics of the ideal (without gaps) and real (taking account the gaps, manufacturing and installation errors) bearings, substantiation of the transfer mechanism of motion from the rollers to bearing cage, modeling the dynamics of rolling, research of interaction forces of the rollers with bearing cage. Findings. It is established that the kinematics of ideal bearing {{is determined by the}} contact deformations of the rollers and rings, when the kinematics of real bearing depends mainly on the side gaps in the windows of the bearing cage. On the basis of studies of the real bearing kinematics the dynamics models of the rollers and bearing cage interaction were constructed. The conducted studies of kinematics and dynamics of rolling bearings have changed our view of them as of the planetary mechanism, explained the reason of bearing cage loading, and confirmed the possibility of destruction during operation. Originality. It was first proposed a mechanism for motion transfer from the rollers to the bearing cage of roller bearings, consisting in that the side gap in the bearing cage window is reduced gradually multiple of the number of rollers of radial loading area according to the bearing cage motion. The models of roller bearing dynamics, which allow calculating the interaction forces of parts for all modes of operation, were improved. Practical value. Use of the offered models of kinematics and dynamics of the roller bearings will develop analytical calculation method of the bearing cage for the choice of its optimal design according to criterion of maximum service life and reliability of the bearing unit of wheel sets of the railway rolling stock...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{variations in}} the temperature of <b>axle-box</b> heating of railroad rolling stock considering two modes of the train - driving and parking position. Additionally, the article describes {{the influence of the}} axle load and season on the heat of the <b>axle-box,</b> forecasts intolerable residual resources and explains a possibility of detecting likely breakage {{at the very beginning of}} defects. The paper also deals with scientific literature related to <b>axle-box</b> heating and focuses on the conducted practical and theoretical experiments. The carried out research has established the rates of operating heating and critical heating. The application of numerical values for the algorithm of automatic control devices could help with detecting the breakdowns of the <b>axle-box</b> before they reach a critical state and assist in forecasting residual operating resources...|$|E
40|$|Breakdown {{of rolling}} stock axle-boxes if not {{detected}} {{in due time}} may cause a rail accident or disaster. At present, a lot of advanced technologies, modern equipment and devices, which “recognizes” faulty axle-boxes when the train is in motion, have been implemented. However, the timely identification of breakdown of rolling stock axle-boxes still is an acute problem, the initial stage of damage emergence being especially problematic. Presently, rolling stock <b>axle-box</b> breakdown is determined according to the higher than permissible temperature of the <b>axle-box</b> body. The article provides statistical data of dangerously heated axle-boxes, determined train delay durations, the number of delayed trains by danger level, and dependence of damage on the season. After systematization of data on <b>axle-box</b> damage and heating temperatures of broken axle-boxes, heating tendencies of axle-boxes of freight wagons are described. Finally, basic conclusions are given...|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the heating process of the axle-boxes ofrolling stock when the train is in motion and {{discusses}} the forcesacting on the wheel-set when rolling stock moves along the trackcurves. The paper analyses scientific publications relevant tothe forces acting on the wheel-set of rolling stock and focuseson the <b>axle-box</b> heating process. The article also discusses theresults of theoretical studies on wheel-set forces that affect theheat exchange process of axle-boxes for a railway vehicle. Theresearch has determined a change in heating temperatures ofdifferent axle-boxes of rolling stock and reasons for their variationsand tendencies. The paper has estimated an effect of thetrain running along the track curves on the heating intensity ofthe <b>axle-box.</b> Finally, valid conclusions and recommendationshave been provided...|$|E
40|$|As a {{main part}} of {{continuously}} welded rail track, rail weld widely exists in high-speed railway. However, short-wave irregularities can easily initiate and develop in rail weld due to the limitation of welding technology and thus rail weld has been a main high-frequency excitation and is responsible for deterioration of track components. This work reports a 3 D finite element model of wheel-rail rolling contact which can simulate dynamic wheel-rail interaction at arbitrary contact geometry up to 400 [*]km/h. This model is employed to investigate dynamic response of wheel-rail interaction at theoretical and measured rail weld, including wheel-rail force and <b>axle-box</b> acceleration. These simulation results, combined with Quality Index (QI) method, are used to develop a quantitative expression, which can be easily applied for evaluating rail weld deterioration based on measured rail profiles and <b>axle-box</b> acceleration...|$|E

All these methods gave compatible results...|$|E
30|$|For the {{diagnosis}} of track defects {{during the last few}} years, several trains instrumented capable of continuous measurement and all the geometric parameters of interest including the profile of the rail, have been designed. For example the HSRCA system (High Speed Rail Corrugation Analyser), a not-in-contact system with <b>Axle-box</b> Accelerometers, is extremely reliable even at relatively high speeds (maximum recommended running speed of 120  km/h) [26].|$|E
40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to indistinct expert system for {{diagnostics}} of <b>axle-box</b> assemblies. The application of fuzzy systems methodology {{to the construction of}} fuzzy expert system for diagnostics of faults of axle boxes has allowed increasing adequacy of the diagnostics model of axle-boxes owing to the use of experience and intuitive knowledge of experts. The fuzzy expert system is able to simulate a course of reasoning of the expert and to explain its actions; also it removes a psychological barrier of misunderstanding in a process of interaction between the user and the system...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{shows the}} {{activities}} {{carried out at}} Politecnico di Torino to develop monitoring systems to be installed on board railway vehicles, capable of measuring and processing the signals detected on the <b>axle-box,</b> and on the bogie in order to detect malfunctions of several critical components.

Various architectures have been designed considering the need to reduce the cost of the system so as to allow its application on a large variety of vehicles, including freight vehicles. The novelty of this approach {{is the fact that the}} acquisition system and diagnostics was developed specifically for the railway application starting from the level of hardware architectur...|$|E
40|$|Disturbance to {{building}} occupants caused by tram-generated ground-borne {{noise and vibration}} presents a significant barrier {{to the expansion of}} tram networks in our cities. Furthermore, such disturbance is often an indicator of deteriorating track infrastructure. Monitoring and understanding ground-borne noise and vibration is therefore a key priority for tram operators. Project VIMTO (Vibration and Impact Monitoring of Tram Operations) is concerned with developing a new system for monitoring vibration and impact of trams, whereby the vehicles themselves are used as the primary monitoring instrument. Low-cost vehicle-mounted instrumentation is being used to record <b>axle-box</b> vibration signatures, along with positioning data, to ‘map’ a tram network in terms of its propensity to generate vibration. Such mapping aims to offer near real-time continuous monitoring, enabling the formulation of more efficient, optimised maintenance strategies. This paper describes the current development system and presents some initial results from trials on the Midland Metro, UK. This work was funded by the EPSRC Impact Acceleration Account (Grant No. EP/K 503757 / 1) and by the Cambridge Centre for Smart Infrastructure and Construction (EP/I 019308 / 1) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{target of}} the {{research}} activity {{presented in this paper}} is to design, to realize and to test an autonomous sensor node able to measure the accelerations in correspondence of the axle box of a freight train. The final goal of the sensor is to identify the derailment conditions by observing the variations in the spectra of the box accelerations, around the frequencies associated to the wheel revolution and its multiples. The sensor node embeds an accelerometer, a microprocessor, a transmission system, a piezoelectric bimorph energy harvester and an integrated circuit for managing the power distribution to each component of the node. In particular, a mechanical filter to be applied to the node was specifically designed to increment the energy recovered by the harvester and to filter out the high frequency components of the <b>axle-box</b> acceleration, allowing the use of a more sensitive accelerometer. The harvesting system was setup by means of laboratory tests carried out with an electromechanical shaker and the sensor node was finally tested through field tests on freight trains...|$|E
40|$|Reliable axlebox based {{measurement}} of rail roughness {{has been a}} fervent topic of research recently, due to its potential low-cost convenience and network coverage. Present research results for model-based estimation of rail roughness, based on <b>axle-box</b> accelerometers, are presented. A mechanics based model is developed, {{taking into account the}} dynamic characteristics of the track and bogie for estimation of rail profile, based on multiple accelerometer measurements {{on both sides of the}} track. The model is tested and validated against field measurements of rail profile data. In particular, impact response testing of the vehicle (AK car) is first performed to determine the dynamic characteristics of the axlebox in response to various force inputs. This understanding is used to tune the model that is then applied to field accelerometer measurements from left and right axle boxes to predict the rail profiles. The comparison of these measurements with the field profile measurements is performed to reveal the importance of various aspects of the model. The results highlight the importance of considering vibrational input from both sides of the track as well as the effects of speed and track and vehicle dynamic characteristics. The danger of using simplified double integration models, such as substantial speed dependent errors, is highlighted...|$|E
