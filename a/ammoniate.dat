Das linear aufgebaute Ammoniakat von Goldcyanid ermöglicht die Ausbildung von aurophilen Wechselwirkungen. Metallophile Wechselwirkungen zwischen dem als Dimer vorliegenden Ammoniakat von AgCN scheinen nicht ausgebildet zu werden. rnrnMetatheseversuche von Goldiodid mit einem Amid und diversen Alkanolaten lieferten teilweise explosive Produkte. Es ist davon auszugehen, dass mit zunehmender Basizität der eingesetzten Anionen, die an das Gold(I) -ion koordinierten Ammoniakmoleküle deprotoniert werden und explosives Goldamid gebildet wird. Der als zweites Produkt entstehende Alkohol kann ebenfalls ein Ammoniakat bilden. Im Fall von Li-Fencholat wird ein solches in Form sehr tiefschmelzender Einkristalle erhalten. rnrnDa die Deprotonierung der an Gold koordinierten Ammoniakmoleküle unweigerlich zu explosiven oder sehr instabilen Produkten führt, wurde die geringere Basizität der Phenolate ausgenutzt, um dies zu umgehen.

With the <b>ammoniate</b> of gold(I) iodide metathesis reactions were carried out in liquid ammonia, which allowed the isolation of some very thermolabile, partly explosive alcoholates of gold. The crystal structure of a gold(I) -phenolate allowed a first insight into their structure. rnIn the series of the ammoniates of the M(I) Hal, except of silver iodide, no direct metal-halogen contacts are formed. Isotype structure is found for the ammoniates of chlorides and bromides of copper(I) and silver(I) as well of copper(I) iodide.

50|$|Prior to 1980, several {{compounds}} {{were investigated}} for hydrogen storage including complex borohydrides, or aluminohydrides, and ammonium salts. These hydrides have an upper theoretical hydrogen yield limited to about 8.5% by weight. Amongst the compounds that contain only B, N, and H (both {{positive and negative}} ions), representative examples include: amine boranes, boron hydride <b>ammoniates,</b> hydrazine-borane complexes, and ammonium octahydrotriborates or tetrahydroborates. Of these, amine boranes (and especially ammonia borane) have been extensively investigated as hydrogen carriers. During the 1970s and 1980s, the U.S. Army and Navy funded efforts aimed at developing hydrogen/deuterium gas-generating compounds {{for use in the}} HF/DF and HCl chemical lasers, and gas dynamic lasers. Earlier hydrogen gas-generating formulations used amine boranes and their derivatives. Ignition of the amine borane(s) forms boron nitride (BN) and hydrogen gas. In addition to ammonia borane(H3BNH3), other gas-generators include diborane diammoniate, H2B(NH3)2BH4.|$|R
40|$|Liquid <b>ammoniates,</b> {{which are}} highly {{conductive}} electrolyte (more than 100 mS. cm- 1 at 20 °C), are proposed as solvents for a redox battery working around room temperature, and up 80 °C. In the negative compartment, the anolyte is NaI · 3. 3 NH 3, and the Na+/Na couple is proposed. It is reversible, {{as determined by}} cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic cycling. In the positive compartment, the catholyte NaI · 3. 3 NH 3 enriched in silver cations is proposed too. The cathodic material is merely this compound and the cathode is the silver metal. The couple Ag+/Ag is reversible too, as determined by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic cycling. Metallic sodium is extremely stable in this electrolyte; therefore NaI · 3. 3 NH 3 {{could be used in}} a redox battery of high energy density and high power density. The maximum working temperature, which is proposed, 70 °C, is lower than the melting point of sodium (98 °C), and avoids high pressures of ammonia...|$|R
40|$|Metal amidoborane <b>ammoniate</b> such as Mg-(NH 2 BH 3) (2) center dot NH 3 and Ca(NH 2 BH 3) (2) center dot nNH(3) with n = 1, 2, release NH 3 {{predominantly}} and endothermically at {{low temperatures}} in an open-system. However, a strong exothermic reaction occurs when these ammoniates were dehydrogenated in a closed-system, where the adducted NH 3 {{take part in}} the reaction. Our approach in tailoring the thermodynamic properties of Mg(NH 2 BH 3) (2) center dot NH 3, by replacing its adducted NH 3 with amide was successful, yielding a composite consisting of bimetallic amidoborane and Mg(NH 2) (2). Crystal structures of bimetallic amidoboranes, i. e., Na 2 Mg(NH 2 BH 3) (4) and K 2 Mg(NH 2 BH 3) (4) were identified and solved. Significant improvement in the dehydrogenation thermodynamic was observed in the composite system as compared to the pristine Mg(NH 2 BH 3) (2) center dot NH 3, i. e., the dehydrogenation enthalpies were altered from an exothermic to an endothermic one. In addition, the detection of bimetallic amidoboranes in the composites urges detailed investigation on pristine bimetallic amidoborane, to which later we found that Na 2 Mg(NH 2 BH 3) (4) also dehydrogenated endothermically at the identical temperature range (ca. 150 - 170 degrees C) with that of composite systems. Similar activation barriers were observed in Na 2 Mg(NH 2 BH 3) (4) and composite systems, suggesting that metal hydride mediation may be the internal barrier that dominates the kinetic barrier of the composite system. First-principles calculations also showed that the thermodynamic stability of metal amidoborane (MNH 2 BH 3, MAB) increases with decreasing Pauling electronegativity of the metal. Based on the calculated results, a reactant stabilization approach was proposed, which suggests that forming a stable reactant is an effective way of reducing the exothermicity of the dehydrogenation of metal amidoborane...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityAn {{extension}} of the thermochemical study {{of the nature of}} dilute solutions of calcium in liquid ammonia initiated in this laboratory was made in this study. Calorimetric measurement of the heat of solution of calcium iodide, which had been prepared a deammoniation of the calcium iodide <b>ammoniate,</b> yielded a value of + 63. 5 kcal. /mole at infinite dilution. A single measurement of the heat of precipitation of CaBr 2 • 8 NH 3 when combined with other thermochemical data gave a heat of solution of calcium bromide of + 64. 1 kcal. /mole. This is evidently in error since in numerous cases {{it has been shown that}} in liquid ammonia and water the heat of solution of the iodide is greater than the heat of solution of the bromide for a common metal. Using the heats of solution measured here and others from the literature heats of solvation were calculated for calcium metal, calcium bromide, calcium iodide, alkali metals (Li, Na, and K), alkali bromides, and alkali iodides. By combining these heats of solvation the heat effects for the following reactions involving calcium were evaluated; (A) 2 I-(g) - 2 e-(g) [...] > 2 I-(am) - 2 e-(am) ΔH - 63. 6 kcal. (B) 2 Br-(g) - 2 e-(g) [...] > 2 Br-(am) - 2 e-(am) ΔH - 80. 7 kcal. (C) 2 Br-(g) - 2 I-(g) [...] > 2 Br-(am) - 2 I-(am) ΔH - 17. 1 kcal. Comparison of the above heat effect with those for the the same reactions derived from the widely studied alkali metals and their halides showed good agreement for the comparison involving A, and poor agreement for the comparison with B or C. Further study of these comparisons indicated errors in heats of solution of calcium bromide and some of the alkali halides (LiI, LiBr, and KBr) which when taken into account improved the comparison with B. Since the above comparisons were made on the assumption that calcium in liquid ammonia (in the metal and halide solutions) was doubly charged the agreement found above was interpreted as evidence for the existence of calcium as Ca++ in dilute solutions of liquid ammonia...|$|E
2500|$|In {{subsequent}} decades, the CHZ concept {{began to}} be challenged as a primary criterion for life, so the concept is still evolving. [...] Since the discovery of evidence for extraterrestrial liquid water, substantial quantities of it are now thought to occur outside the circumstellar habitable zone. The concept of deep biospheres, like Earth's, that exist independently of stellar energy, are now generally accepted in astrobiology given {{the large amount of}} liquid water known to exist within in lithospheres and asthenospheres of the Solar System. Sustained by other energy sources, such as tidal heating or radioactive decay or pressurized by non-atmospheric means, liquid water may be found even on rogue planets, or their moons. Liquid water can also exist at a wider range of temperatures and pressures as a solution, for example with sodium chlorides in seawater on Earth, chlorides and sulphates on equatorial Mars, or <b>ammoniates,</b> due to its different colligative properties.

40|$|Ammonothermal {{synthesis}} is {{a method}} for synthesis and crystal growth suitable for a large range of chemically different materials, such as nitrides (e. g., GaN, AlN), amides (e. g., LiNH 2, Zn(NH 2) 2), imides (e. g., Th(NH) 2), <b>ammoniates</b> (e. g., Ga(NH 3) 3 F 3, [Al(NH 3) 6]I 3 · NH 3) and non-nitrogen compounds like hydroxides, hydrogen sulfides and polychalcogenides (e. g., NaOH, LiHS, CaS, Cs 2 Te 5). In particular, large scale production of high quality crystals is possible, due to comparatively simple scalability of the experimental set-up. The ammonothermal method is defined as employing a heterogeneous reaction in ammonia as one homogenous fluid close to or in supercritical state. Three types of milieus may be applied during ammonothermal synthesis: ammonobasic, ammononeutral or ammonoacidic, evoked by the used starting materials and mineralizers, strongly influencing the obtained products. There is little known about the dissolution and materials transport processes or the deposition mechanisms during ammonothermal crystal growth. However, the initial results indicate the possible nature of different intermediate species present in the respective milieus...|$|R
