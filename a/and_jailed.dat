5|$|Most of the {{judicial}} system and legal codes of the Weimar Republic remained in use {{during and after the}} Nazi era to deal with non-political crimes. The courts issued and carried out far more death sentences than before the Nazis took power. People who were convicted of three or more offences—even petty ones—could be deemed habitual offenders <b>and</b> <b>jailed</b> indefinitely. People such as prostitutes and pickpockets were judged to be inherently criminal and a threat to the racial community. Thousands were arrested and confined indefinitely without trial.|$|E

5|$|As {{he served}} his {{sentence}} in the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas, friends and family continued to occupy some of Vick's other homes in the South Beach section of Miami Beach, Florida.

5|$|Atrash {{continued}} to hold the office of RCC, and was reelected as speaker on 15 February 1966, shortly before the 1966 Syrian coup d'état (21–23 February), which brought the left-wing neo-Ba'athist government of Jadid to power and caused an internal party split. The Jadid government's coming to power resulted in the self-imposed exile of the leading Ba'ath ideologue Michel Aflaq. Atrash, a partisan of Aflaq, was arrested <b>and</b> <b>jailed</b> in the Mezzeh Prison during the coup. The new defense minister and future president Hafez al-Assad later paid him a visit to discuss Syria's political situation and check on his health.|$|E
5|$|Gens had {{a dispute}} with a tailor named Weisskopf, who ran a {{tailoring}} workshop in the ghetto. Weisskopf tried to increase his own power base by negotiating directly with the German Army and not going through the ghetto's Labor Department. When Gens ordered all work contracts {{to go through the}} Labor Department, Weisskopf appealed to his German contacts, but the Gebeitskommissar of Vilnius, Hans Hingst, preferred that control of such contracts go through his own office which worked through the ghetto's administration. Hingst thus ruled in Gens' favor. The ghetto police then searched Weisskopf's house, found contraband, arrested him, <b>and</b> <b>jailed</b> him for four days, after which he lost his position running the workshop.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, Dean Hall {{produced}} a massively popular mod for ARMA 2 {{that prompted the}} studio to develop a standalone game.

This event had significantly lowered team morale and forced the team to rename the ARMA 3s setting to a fictional one.

5|$|Union Democrats chose Joshua Fry Bell {{as their}} {{candidate}} for governor of Kentucky in 1863, but Bell was skeptical of Kentucky's future with the Union and withdrew his name from consideration. The party's central committee chose Bramlette to replace Bell, and Bramlette declined a commission as a brigadier general in the Union Army to make the race. During the election, Union forces intimidated <b>and</b> <b>jailed</b> supporters of Bramlette's opponent, former governor Charles A. Wickliffe. As a result, Bramlette carried the election {{by a margin of}} nearly 4-to-1. During his term, he turned down an offered seat in the U.S. House of Representatives as well as a nomination to become the Democratic candidate for Vice-President in 1864.|$|E

5|$|Aldo Rico {{escaped from}} prison in January 1988 and started a new mutiny in a distant {{regiment}} in the northeast. This time, both the military support for the mutiny and the public outcry against it were minimal. The army attacked him, and Rico surrendered after a brief combat. Colonel Mohamed Alí Seineldín launched a new mutiny in late 1988. As in 1987, the mutineers were defeated <b>and</b> <b>jailed,</b> but the military was reluctant to open fire against them. Alfonsín's goal of reconciling the military with the civil population failed, as the latter rejected the military's complaints, and the military was focused on internal issues. The Movimiento Todos por la Patria, a small guerrilla army led by Enrique Gorriarán Merlo, staged {{the attack on the}} Regiment of La Tablada in 1989. The army killed many of their members, and quickly defeated the uprising.|$|E
5|$|Destined {{to carry}} wheat and {{phosphate}} fertilizer, both ships sailed initially from New Orleans for St John's in October1941, {{to take on}} cargoes of wheat bound for Ireland. Since insurers such as Lloyd's of London charged higher premiums for ships not in convoy, the Irish Oak and the Irish Pine were painted war-time camouflage in preparation for sailing in-convoy. Irish Pine joined Convoy SC56 and arrived in Dublin on 11December1941. In contrast, Irish Oak experienced a number of serious mishaps and setbacks: Chief Engineer R. Marsh, of Dublin, {{suffered a heart attack}} and was hospitalised in New Orleans; another engineer, O’Keefe of Dún Laoghaire, was severely burned in a boiler room blow-back and hospitalised in StJohn; and a locally recruited Greek replacement engineer caused difficulties, was reported to the Canadian authorities by the captain, <b>and</b> <b>jailed.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Petersburg, Virginia, the {{two women}} moved out of broken seats in the black (and back) section of the bus, where state {{segregation}} laws mandated they sit, and into the white section. Inspired by a conversation they had been having about Gandhian civil disobedience, {{the two women}} refused {{to return to the}} rear even after the police were called. They were arrested <b>and</b> <b>jailed.</b> Murray and McBean initially were defended by the NAACP, but when the pair were convicted only of disorderly conduct rather than violating segregation laws, the organization ceased to represent them. The Workers' Defense League (WDL), a socialist labor rights organization that also was beginning to take civil rights cases, paid her fine. A few months later the WDL hired Murray for its administrative committee.|$|E

5|$|Nelson {{has been}} arrested several times for {{marijuana}} possession. The first occasion was in 1974 in Dallas, Texas. In 1977 after a tour with Hank Cochran, Nelson traveled to The Bahamas. Nelson and Cochran arrived late {{to the airport and}} boarded the flight without luggage. The bags were later sent to them. As Nelson and Cochran claimed their luggage in the Bahamas, a customs officer questioned Nelson after marijuana was found in a pair of his jeans. Nelson was arrested <b>and</b> <b>jailed.</b> As Cochran made arrangements to pay the bail, he took Nelson a six-pack of beer to his cell. Nelson was released a few hours later. Inebriated, he fell after he jumped celebrating and was taken to the emergency room. He then appeared before the judge, who dropped the charges but ordered Nelson to never return to the country.|$|E
5|$|Castillo Armas' {{force of}} 480 {{men had been}} split into four teams, {{ranging in size from}} 60 to 198. On 15 June 1954 these four forces left their bases in Honduras and El Salvador, and {{assembled}} in various towns just outside the Guatemalan border. The largest force was supposed to attack the Atlantic harbor town of Puerto Barrios, while the others attacked the smaller towns of Esquipulas, Jutiapa, and Zacapa, the Guatemalan army's largest frontier post. The invasion plan quickly faced difficulties; the 60-man force was intercepted <b>and</b> <b>jailed</b> by Salvadoran policemen before it got to the border. At 8:20am on 18 June 1954, Castillo Armas led his invading troops over the border. Ten trained saboteurs preceded the invasion, with the aim of blowing up railways and cutting telegraph lines. At about the same time, Castillo Armas' planes flew over a pro-government rally in the capital. Castillo Armas demanded Árbenz's immediate surrender. The invasion provoked a brief panic in the capital, which quickly decreased as the rebels failed to make any striking moves. Bogged down by supplies and a lack of transportation, Castillo Armas' forces took several days to reach their targets, although their planes blew up a bridge on 19 June.|$|E
