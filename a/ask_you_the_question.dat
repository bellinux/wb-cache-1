6000|$|... "Yes, Mary. What answer do {{you think}} I ought to give? I wish to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> as you are the person the most concerned." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] he said, [...] "I {{preferred}} {{to keep up}} my reputation as an eccentric person. At any rate, you must remember that it was open to me at any moment to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> I have asked you now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Since you insist, then," [...] he declared, [...] "I will <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> which I {{should have}} asked your sister. That is what you desire?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You will pardon my having <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> again," [...] De Rebers said; [...] "but really, {{it seemed}} well-nigh {{impossible}} that a gentleman who, as I take it, can yet be scarcely of age, should have slain Raoul de Fontaine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Merry, my darling!' {{said the}} fair Miss Pecksniff, {{opening the door}} of the usual sitting-room. 'Here are Mr Pinch and his sister come to see you! I thought we should find you here, Mrs Todgers! How do you do, Mrs Gamp? And how do you do, Mr Chuffey, though it's of no use <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> I am well aware.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{did not do}} so. She simply bade me ask yourself. And she was right. On such {{a matter}} {{there is no one}} to whom I can with propriety address myself, but to yourself. Therefore I now <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>question.</b> May I venture to have any hope?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{expected}} {{that you would}} say that," [...] he remarked coolly. [...] "Still, our meeting like this induced me to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>question.</b> If I can be of any service to you in London, I hope you will not fail to let me know. Your uncle would never forgive me if I did not do everything I could {{in the way of}} looking after you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{is that to}} me? Is {{your duty}} to him higher than your duty to me? Can you be bound by any promise to so great a crime as that would be? I will <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> once more, and I will be governed by your answer. If you will promise to discard this man, you shall return home with me, and shall then choose {{everything}} for yourself. We will go abroad and travel if you wish it, and all things shall be prepared to give you pleasure. You shall have at once the full enjoyment of all that has been won for you; and as for your cousin,--you shall not for a while be troubled even by his name. It is the dear wish of my heart {{that you should be}} the wife of Earl Lovel;--but I have one wish dearer even than that,--one to which that shall be altogether postponed. If you will save yourself, and me, and all your family from the terrible disgrace with which you have threatened us,--I will not again mention your cousin's name to you till it shall please you to hear it. Anna, you knelt to me, just now. Shall I kneel to you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}}--can you mean, Bertha?" [...] he said, {{in a low}} tone. [...] "Do you mean that if I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> same <b>question</b> again <b>you</b> will give me a {{different}} answer?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know why}} you should look at me as though I were a ghost," [...] he said. [...] "If it comes to that, I might <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> same <b>question.</b> What are you doing here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> a <b>question</b> <b>the</b> {{other night}} which you never answered," [...] he said. [...] "Have you sent off that document--liberating yourself?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Hanagan {{became the}} first northern-based jockey ever to win the flat {{championship}} more than once, and having initially suggested he would not go all out for a third title {{in a row in}} 2012, he suggested in late November 2011 that, while he wanted to focus on riding a better quality of horse, he may try to retain the championship, saying [...] "If I can recharge the batteries and have a good rest then I might think 'well I might give it a good go... I say won't go for it again every time but they <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> straight after you get off the horse - it's the worst possible time to ask." ...|$|E

He {{grew up in a}} catholic church but has said he didn't have a personal relationship with God until about 2013. In his own words 'To cut a long story short, ...we were touring Sri Lanka and myself, AB De Villiers, Faf Du Plessis and David Miller started a little Bible study together in the national team. One of the sessions was called ‘Salvation’ {{and at the end of}} <b>the</b> chapter it <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of whether <b>you</b> are willing to commit yourself to God. On that night all four of us committed our lives to him, this all happened in a marine boat place in Sri Lanka somewhere. Months later I got baptised along with my wife.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, Tattycoram,' {{returned}} Mr Meagles, 'since <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> {{and we are}} all friends here, {{perhaps you}} may as well mention it, if you are so inclined.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Since <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> I may say this--If Miss Chisholm has two lady {{visitors}} {{during the}} next few days, you might make sure that she sees them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What for no?' In {{the grand}} style, 'Mrs. Dowey, you queer carl, you spunky tiddy, have I your {{permission}} to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> most important <b>question</b> a neglected orphan can ask {{of an old}} lady?' ...|$|R

40|$|This {{field visit}} {{took place in}} 2010 and focuses on the rural area {{to the east of}} the campus of Lancaster University in {{northern}} England. The aims are to: * explore recent pressures on rural land use and the ways public policies have tried to resolve these; * examine specific local examples of general national rural trends; * introduce you to some of the recent planning controversies in the local area. This virtual field visit has been designed to give you as close an experience to the outdoors version as is possible. It shows what you would have seen. It <b>asks</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>the</b> tutor would have <b>asked</b> <b>you.</b> It explains what is on the ground and the processes that created it. So you will get all the academic benefit from this virtual field visit that you would have had if you had actually walked the route. Fieldwork location [54. 004994,- 2. 786236...|$|R
6000|$|... "Monsieur," [...] I said quietly, [...] "you {{have spoken}} well and convincingly. Pardon my presumption, if I venture to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> one <b>question.</b> <b>The</b> Power of whom you have spoken--is it England?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "God knows, I don't! But since <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> why are <b>you</b> here, Isobel? It is Isobel, isn't it, or am I still dreaming? Let me {{touch you}} and I shall know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am trying}} to find out," [...] Lutchester replied grimly. [...] "Still, since <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> <b>the</b> pocketbook which {{is on its way}} to Germany, and which I picked up when Nikasti was taken ill--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As I have said, Madame, it is {{possible}} that he is not dead--nay, even that he will not die. For <b>the</b> rest, since <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> my opponent was, indeed, M. de Canaples--Eugène de Canaples." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why! How can <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>question?</b> Because no time {{is to be}} lost in {{frightening}} my old housekeeper out of her wits, because I must go {{and prepare}} a dinner for you, to be sure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{came because}} I {{was told that}} you were {{to be married to}} this man. I <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> and <b>you</b> would not deny it. Then I said to myself that I would wait and see.' When he had spoken she had nothing farther to say to him. The charges which he made against her were all true. They seemed at least to be true to her then in her present mood,--in that mood in which all that she now desired was his forgiveness. The wish to defend herself, and to stand before him as one justified, had gone from her. She felt that having still possessed his love, having still been the owner of the one thing that she valued, she had ruined herself by her own doubts; and she could not forgive herself the fatal blunder. 'It is of no use to think of it any more,' he said at last. 'You have to become this man's wife now, and I suppose you must go through with it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Carroll {{crossed his}} finger tips {{and looked at}} her over them. [...] "Since <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> I may say this: If Miss Chisholm has two lady {{visitors}} during the next few days, you might make sure she sees them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "May I <b>ask</b> why <b>you</b> put <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> Hilliard? <b>You</b> {{have really}} a splendid opening, here. You are surely {{not going to}} be foolish enough to chuck it, with the idea of {{returning}} to England, and taking anything that may turn up?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Twas {{a little}} onreasonable in you Sarpent," [...] he said, [...] "to bring {{up such a}} subject afore Hist, and when the young women of my own colour might overhear what was said. Yes, 'twas a little more onreasonable than most things that you do. No matter; Hist didn't comprehend, and the other didn't hear. Howsever, <b>the</b> <b>question</b> is easier put than answered. No mortal can say where he will be when the sun rises to-morrow. I will <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> same <b>question,</b> Sarpent, and should like to hear what answer you can give." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{am going}} to do what I can," [...] put in Roger. [...] "And my two chums are going to help me. But I was going to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a <b>question.</b> <b>The</b> clerk {{suggested}} that we <b>ask</b> <b>you.</b> Do you know an old miner named Abe Blower?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me <b>the</b> <b>question!</b> I know it, because I know you. Your silence, dearest, {{has never}} lowered <b>you</b> in <b>the</b> {{estimation}} of your true friends. The disappearance of your precious birthday gift may seem strange; your unexplained connection with that event may seem stranger still." ...|$|R
40|$|Today's {{question}} is from Peter Wright from Western Australia. Peter asks: Where did the convention of referring to Left and Right sides of politics come from? What {{is the history}} of the use of these terms and why left and right rather than other opposites like north and south? <b>You</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions,</b> we find <b>the</b> answers...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of what harm," [...] she echoed, eyeing {{him with}} a scorn that would have slain him had he any manhood left. [...] "Of what harm? Mother of Mercy, defend me! Do <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>question?</b> What greater harm could have come to me than to have fallen {{into the hands of}} Ramiro del' Orca and his brigands?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{something}} {{like what we}} used to be taught in the nursery," [...] I thought to myself, looking back through the long years (about a hundred of them, since <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>question),</b> to <b>the</b> time when I was a little child. And here an idea came into my head, and I asked him [...] "Aren't <b>you</b> one of <b>the</b> Fairies that teach children to be good?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's on the plains," [...] laughed Harry. [...] "On {{this side}} of the Rockies it's any piece of cleared land with a house on it. At quite a few of the ranches they raise nothing but fruit. As <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> though, our cattle are in the bush. They run there and live on what they can find until we round them up. Now we'll get to work." ...|$|R
2500|$|When <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> [...] "Does Iraq possess militarily viable {{biological}} or chemical weapons?" [...] {{the answer is}} [...] "NO!" [...] It is a resounding [...] "NO". Can Iraq produce today chemical weapons on a meaningful scale? No! Can Iraq produce biological weapons on a meaningful scale? No! Ballistic missiles? No! It is [...] "no" [...] across the board. So from a qualitative standpoint, Iraq has been disarmed. Iraq today possesses no meaningful {{weapons of mass destruction}} capability.|$|R
