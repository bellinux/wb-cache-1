5|$|The book's initial {{critical}} reception was modest, but it {{was popular}} with the public <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> out of print.

5|$|A typical Robinsonade– a {{genre of}} fiction {{inspired}} by Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe– {{and one of}} the most popular of its type, the book first went on sale in late 1857 <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> out of print. Among the novel's major themes are the civilising effect of Christianity, 19th-century British imperialism in the South Pacific, and the importance of hierarchy and leadership. It was the inspiration for William Golding's dystopian novel Lord of the Flies (1954), which inverted the morality of The Coral Island; in Ballantyne's story the children encounter evil, but in Lord of the Flies evil is within them.|$|E

5|$|An autopsy reveals Wells' {{death was}} the result of an asthma attack. However the ambitious {{district}} attorney, Gordon Roberts (Robert Wisden) believes Plott is somehow responsible. The investigation stalls until another child, Danielle Barbakow (Lauren Diewold), mentions overhearing Wells being physically abused by Plott. Plott is arrested by Sherman, who she reprimands sternly, reminding him that she looked after him as a child too, <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> accused of anything in three decades of childcare work. Sherman sees she is incapable of what she has been accused of and continues to send his son to the daycare, but other parents protest, to the point of picketing and vandalizing the fence around the daycare.|$|E
5|$|From 1930 to 1970, the Jules Rimet Trophy {{was awarded}} to the World Cup winning team. It was {{originally}} simply known as the World Cup or Coupe du Monde, but in 1946 it was renamed after the FIFA president Jules Rimet who set up the first tournament. In 1970, Brazil's third victory in the tournament entitled them to keep the trophy permanently.

Work commenced on the south west tower in 1508, but it had not risen above the roofline {{at the time of the}} dissolution of the monasteries, <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> completed.

5|$|Dr. No was {{released}} on 31 March 1958 in the UK as a hardcover edition by the publishers Jonathan Cape. A paperback edition was issued by Pan Books in February 1960; over 115,000 copies were sold that year. The first American edition was published in June 1958 by Macmillan under the name Doctor No. The largest boost in sales of the novel came in 1962 {{with the release of}} the film adaptation. In the seven months after the picture's release, 1.5 million copies of the book were sold. In 1964 the novel was serialised in France-Soir for the French market, which led to increased sales of Bond works in that country; 480,000 French-language copies of the six Bond novels were sold that year. Since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> out of print.|$|E
5|$|Moonraker was {{published}} in the UK by Jonathan Cape in hardback format on 5 April 1955 with a cover designed by Kenneth Lewis, following Fleming's suggestions of using a stylised flame motif; the first impression was of 9,900 copies. The US publication was by Macmillan on 20 September that year. In October 1956 Pan Books published a paperback version of the novel in the UK, which sold 43,000 copies {{before the end of the}} year. In December that year the US paperback {{was published}} under the title Too Hot to Handle by Permabooks. This edition was rewritten to Americanise the British idioms used, and Fleming provided a number of explanatory footnotes such as the value of English currency against the dollar. Since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> out of print.|$|E
5|$|The trophy was {{not without}} {{precedent}} in Major League baseball: the Dauvray Cup (named after actress Helen Dauvray) was awarded to {{the winner of the}} World Series between the National League and the American Association from 1887 to 1890, and from 1891 to 1893, when a solitary major league remained, to the winner of the National League pennant. The Dauvray Cup was to be held by the victorious team, and was to be relinquished the following year when (and if) a new champion team emerged. The Dauvray Cup mysteriously vanished following the 1893 series <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> located. From 1894 to 1897, the Temple Cup was awarded to the winner of a postseason contest between the two top National League clubs.|$|E

5|$|Two extinct flightless {{species of}} rail were {{at one time}} placed in the genus Atlantisia with the Inaccessible Island rail. The Ascension crake (Mundia elpenor) and the Saint Helena {{swamphen}} (Aphanocrex podarces) were once considered congeners of A. rogersi. The Ascension crake disappeared some time before 1700 but was briefly mentioned and described by traveller and hobby naturalist Peter Mundy in 1656. The Saint Helena swamphen disappeared before 1600 <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> encountered alive by scientists. In 1973 Olson synonymised the genus Aphanocrex with the genus Atlantisia, and described the Ascension crake as being congeneric. Today they are considered to have evolved independently (with A. podarces probably not even being closely related), and in 2003 the genus Mundia was erected and the Saint Helena swamphen moved back to Aphanocrex, leaving the Inaccessible Island rail the only species in the genus Atlantisia. Both the Ascension crake and the Saint Helena swamphen became extinct due to predation by introduced species, mainly cats and rats.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds Are Forever was {{published}} on 26 March 1956 by Jonathan Cape {{with a cover}} designed by Pat Marriott. As with the three previous Bond books, {{the first edition of}} 12,500 copies sold out quickly; the US edition {{was published}} in October 1956 by Macmillan. The novel was serialised in The Daily Express newspaper from 12 April 1956 onwards—the first of Fleming's novels he had sold to the newspaper—which led to an overall rise in the sales of the novels. From November 1956 sales of Diamonds Are Forever, and Fleming's other novels, all rose following the visit of the Prime Minister, Sir Anthony Eden, to Fleming's Goldeneye estate to recuperate following the Suez Crisis; Eden's stay was much reported in the British press. The book received boosts in sales in 1962 when Eon Productions adapted Dr. No for the cinema, and in 1971 when Diamonds Are Forever was produced for the big screen. In February 1958 Pan Books published a paperback version of the novel in the UK, which sold 68,000 copies {{before the end of the}} year.

25|$|Other {{sources have}} {{suggested}} that Gunner Robert Buie (also of the 53rd Battery) may have fired the fatal shot. There is little support for this theory.
