40|$|International audienceMissense <b>alterations</b> of the {{mismatch}} repair gene MLH 1 {{have been identified}} in a significant proportion of individuals suspected of having Lynch syndrome, a hereditary syndrome which predisposes for cancer of colon and endometrium. The pathogenicity of many of these <b>alterations,</b> however, is unclear. A number of MLH 1 <b>alterations</b> are located in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of MLH 1, which is responsible for constitutive dimerization with PMS 2. We analyzed which <b>alterations</b> may result in pathogenic effects due to interference with dimerization. We used a structural model of CTD of MLH 1 -PMS 2 heterodimer to select 19 MLH 1 <b>alterations</b> located inside and outside two candidate dimerization interfaces in the MLH 1 -CTD. Three <b>alterations</b> (p. Gln 542 Leu, p. Leu 749 Pro, p. Tyr 750 X) caused decreased co-expression of PMS 2, which is unstable in the absence of interaction with MLH 1, suggesting that these <b>alterations</b> interfere with dimerization. All three <b>alterations</b> are located within the dimerization interface suggested by our model. They also compromised mismatch repair, suggesting that defects in dimerization abrogate repair and confirming that all three <b>alterations</b> are pathogenic. Additionally, we provided biochemical evidence that four <b>alterations</b> with uncertain pathogenicity (p. Ala 586 Pro, p. Leu 636 Pro, p. Thr 662 Pro, and p.

We reviewed the medical histories of patients who requested medicalappointments due to dermatological, ear and ophtalmological <b>alterations</b> in 2009 and 2010. Results. In the assessed period, the prevalenceof dermatological <b>alterations</b> in dogs was of 7. 8 %, 4. 2 % of ear <b>alterations</b> and of 3. 3 % of ophtalmological <b>alterations.</b> The main etiologicalsuspects through clinical diagnosis were: dermatophytes with an incidence of 86. 9 % among dermatological <b>alterations,</b> Malasseziawith an 86. 5 % of incidence in ear <b>alterations,</b> and Candida with 83. 3 % of incidence in ophtalmological <b>alterations.</b> Statistical analysisof variables showed no association with symptoms or clinically diagnosed etiological agents, but the categorized evaluation showedassociations of races and ages with the etiologies through clinical diagnosis. The diagnosis of fungal etiologies was accomplished in mostcases by clinical findings and less frequently by skin scrapings and ear cytology; in none of the cases a mycological culture was done. The feline population showed no dermatological, ear or ophtalmological <b>alterations</b> compatible with a fungal etiology. Conclusion. In canines, the prevalence of dermatological <b>alterations</b> clinically compatible with dermatophytes was of 86. 9 %; ear <b>alterations</b> associated with Malassezia were of 86. 5 %; and ophtalmological <b>alterations</b> Candida-suspected were 83. 3 %.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{retrospectively}} evaluate plantar fat pad (PFP) signal intensity <b>alterations</b> in {{magnetic resonance}} (MR) imaging studies of asymptomatic volunteers and to compare PFP <b>alterations</b> with histopathologic findings in cadavers and patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After appropriate {{institutional review board}} approval and any required informed consent were obtained, MR imaging studies of 70 asymptomatic volunteers (35 women, 35 men; mean age, 45 years; range, 21 - 69 years) obtained for another investigation were retrospectively analyzed by two musculoskeletal radiologists in consensus. The location, signal intensity, margin, extent, and size of PFP <b>alterations</b> were determined. MR imaging-histopathologic comparison was performed in six cadaveric feet and six feet of symptomatic patients (one woman, five men; mean age, 43 years; range, 31 - 60 years). For volunteers, the relationship between PFP <b>alterations</b> and Morton neuroma, age, and sex was analyzed by using the Fisher exact test, Spearman rank correlation, and the Wilcoxon rank sum test, respectively. Bonferroni correction was applied, and P <. 01 was considered to indicate a significant difference. RESULTS: Fifty-nine (84 %) volunteers had PFP signal intensity <b>alterations.</b> Forty-nine (70 %), six (9 %), one (1 %), four (6 %), and 43 (61 %) volunteers had <b>alterations</b> beneath the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth metatarsal heads, respectively. Ninety-four (91 %) of 103 signal intensity <b>alterations</b> were {{in the form of}} hypointensity on T 2 -weighted images. Blurred margins were present in 90 (87 %) <b>alterations.</b> Ninety percent of all PFP <b>alterations</b> in asymptomatic volunteers were 14 mm or smaller. The relationship between PFP <b>alterations</b> and Morton neuroma, age, and sex was not statistically significant. In cadaveric forefeet, PFP <b>alterations</b> corresponded histopathologically to a variable amount of fibrosis. In nine PFP <b>alterations,</b> development of fluid-containing spaces resembling bursae was present. Among the six patients with PFP <b>alterations,</b> histopathologic examination revealed fibrosis and adventitious bursae in two, fibrosis with inflammation in three, and a soft-tissue chondroma in one. CONCLUSION: PFP signal intensity <b>alterations</b> are commonly seen in asymptomatic volunteers under the first and fifth metatarsal heads. At histologic examination, PFP signal intensity <b>alterations</b> correspond most commonly to fibrosis and adventitious bursae...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Mesenteric <b>alterations</b> are {{associated}} with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), but the frequency and prognostic value of mesenteric <b>alterations</b> are unknown in patients with NHL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively screened 120 patients that were treated for NHL between January 1996 and December 2001 {{for the presence of}} mesenteric <b>alterations,</b> defined on computed tomography (CT) scans as nodular or diffuse infiltration of the abdominal mesentery with increased density of mesenteric fat. RESULTS: 21 patients (17. 5 %) had radiological findings of mesenteric <b>alterations</b> {{at the time of the}} initial NHL diagnosis. Mesenteric <b>alterations</b> were significantly associated with mesenteric lymphadenopathy (p = 0. 01). In about 50 % of the patients, mesenteric <b>alterations</b> could not be explained by direct mesenteric tumour invasion or overt lymphatic obstruction. Patients with initial findings of mesenteric <b>alterations</b> tended to have a better 4 -year survival as compared to patients without such findings (79 vs. 43 %, p = 0. 11). The International Prognostic Index (IPI) score was the only independent predictor of survival in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: This retrospective screening study found a moderate prevalence of mesenteric <b>alterations</b> in patients with various subtypes of NHL. The diagnostic and prognostic value of mesenteric <b>alterations</b> should be further assessed in prospective studies...|$|R
