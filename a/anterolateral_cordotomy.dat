50|$|Cordotomy (or chordotomy) is a {{surgical}} procedure that disables selected pain-conducting tracts in the spinal cord, {{in order to}} achieve loss of pain and temperature perception. This procedure is commonly performed on patients experiencing severe pain due to cancer or other incurable diseases. <b>Anterolateral</b> <b>cordotomy</b> is effective for relieving unilateral, somatic pain while bilateral cordotomies may be required for visceral or bilateral pain.|$|E
50|$|Otfrid Foerster (9 November 1873, in Breslau, Silesia - 15 June 1941, also in Breslau) was a German {{neurologist}} and neurosurgeon, {{who made}} innovative contributions to neurology and neurosurgery, such as rhizotomy {{for the treatment}} of spasticity, <b>anterolateral</b> <b>cordotomy</b> for pain, the hyperventilation test for epilepsy, Foerster's syndrome, the first electrocorticogram of a brain tumor, and the first surgeries for epilepsy. He is also known as the first to describe the dermatomes (an area of skin that is supplied by a single pair of dorsal nerve roots), and he helped map the motor cortex of the cerebrum http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/59/2/135?ijkey=a357c93b1af6ac4d2422e6ec3624183cb53f6176&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha.|$|E
40|$|The {{anterior}} {{approach to}} surgical treatment of disorders of the cervical spine is described, and the technique and advantages are outlined. A series of 66 patients who underwent 75 procedures is reported. The follow-up period ranged {{from one to}} five years. Good to excellent results were obtained with 91 % of the operations for disc disease, and good results in all cases of fracture-dislocation. Adequate relief of pain was obtained with <b>anterolateral</b> <b>cordotomy</b> in two patients with malignant disease. Only minor complications were encountered; these were easily corrected or cleared up spontaneously. This approach is recommended in preference to the posterior approach for disc disease and fracture-dislocations of the cervical spine...|$|E
40|$|The {{advent of}} neuroaugmentative {{techniques}} {{has reduced the}} application of neuroablative procedures, especially as regards pain of functional origin. Although intracranial ablative procedures are now rarely performed, spinal ablative procedures, such as <b>anterolateral</b> <b>cordotomies</b> or midline myelotomies, remain important {{in the management of}} cancer pain. These procedures produce immediate and satisfactory pain relief with acceptable complication rates. An important future trend will be the application of radiosurgery guided by functional imaging (eg,fMRI, PET) to place such intracranial lesions as cingulotomies or medial thalamotomies...|$|R
40|$|The {{course and}} {{location}} of vestibulospinal, reticulospinal and descending propriospinal fibres in man are reported. The investigation was carried out on three patients with supraspinal lesions, four with transection of the spinal cord and 33 with <b>anterolateral</b> <b>cordotomies.</b> The lateral vestibulospinal tract at the medullospinal junction {{and in the first}} three cervical segments lies {{on the periphery of the}} spinal cord lateral to the anterior roots. It moves to the sulcomarginal angle in the remaining cervical segments. In the thoracic cord, it moves laterally, being traversed by the most lateral of the anterior roots. Reticulospinal fibres descend bilaterally in the spinal cord with a preponderance of ipsilateral fibres. Reticulospinal fibres in general do not form well-defined tracts, but are scattered throughout the anterior and lateral columns. They are intermingled with propriospinal fibres and with ascending and descending fibres of other systems. Most reticulospinal fibres move posterolaterally as they descend. It follows that fibres from the brainstem that enter the cord in the anterior column may be in the lateral column anterior to the lateral corticospinal tract at lower levels. Reticulospinal fibres within the lateral column lie anterior to the lateral corticospinal tract. They consist of scattered fibres between the lateral horn and the periphery, most of them in the medial two-thirds of the column. In addition, they are present in a more compac...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{surgical}} procedures devised for intractable pain are the excision of painful {{area of the}} skin, peripheral neurotomy, intraspinal or intracranial posterior rhizotomies, <b>anterolateral</b> spinal <b>cordotomy,</b> spinothalamic tractotomy at medulla and mesencephalon for the pain of organic origin, and the prefrontal lobotomy for psychogenic pain. Unfortunately, these procedures are followed either by disturbance of physiologic sensory function or by changes of affect and personality. Partial gasserian gangliolysis successfully alleviated the trigeminal neuralgia without significant sensory disturbance of the face. Recent advances in stereotaxic technique has enabled us to attack the thalamus and other deep subcortical centers. This new method, together with recent neuroanatomico-physiological progress in regard to 2 ̆ 2 pain tract 2 ̆ 2 through intralaminar nuclear complex, resulted in discovery of thalamotomy destroying the nucleus centrum medianum with or without adjacent intralaminar nuclei, which eliminates the organic pain without any detectable sensory deficit. Anterior cingulectomy or cingulumotomy has developed to alleviate the psychogenic pain without psychological changes. These are the ideal pain-relieving procedures. A new method of percutaneous cervical cordotomy can be safely used for the debilitated patients with terminal malignant diseases...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{is given}} of the {{location}} in man of the fibres going to the sympathetic neurons of the lateral horn that supply the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the eye and the sweat glands {{of the head and}} neck. For the region of the pons and medulla, the evidence is abstracted from the literature. For the cervical spinal cord, the evidence is from our cases of <b>anterolateral</b> <b>cordotomy.</b> In the medulla, thrombosis of the artery of the fossette latérale destroys the fibres; this locates the fibres in the posterolateral retro-olivary area. But not all fibres to the sudomotor neurons lie there: some run elsewhere, though they probably remain ipsilateral. In the cervical cord, the fibres supplying the sympathetic neurons of the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the eye run near the posterior angle of the anterior horn. Most of the fibres supplying the sudomotor neurons lie in the same region, though some lie outside this area but {{on the same side of}} the cord...|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews {{some major}} {{advances}} {{in our understanding}} of the organization of afferent pain pathways, and relates these and other findings to the limited success rate achieved by various surgical interventions used in the treatment of chronic intractable pain. First-order pain afferents, many of which use the transmitter substance P, may enter the spinal cord via both the dorsal and ventral roots. After terminating superficially in the dorsal horn, information may apparently ascend to higher centres via numerous pathways, some of which are contralateral some ipsilateral. The preferred route to the primary somatosensory cortex appears to be the contralateral spinothalamic tract, but alternate pathways may be recruited following <b>anterolateral</b> <b>cordotomy</b> or thalamotomy. In addition to divergence of the central pain pathways and the presence of ventral root afferents, other factors considered that may contribute to surgical failure include denervation supersensitivity, the occurrence of prolonged spontaneous injury discharge, and divergence of the peripheral branches of nociceptive fibres...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} to determine whether tactile sensibility was affected by <b>anterolateral</b> <b>cordotomy.</b> There were 65 patients who had cordotomies for painful forms of cancer. Thirty eight had necropsy examination with histological investigation of the spinal cord. No form of mechanoreception was removed {{in any of the}} 65 patients and in the majority no forms of tactile sensibility were altered by division of the pathways in the anterolateral and anterior columns. In no case was graphaesthesia affected. Knowledge of joint position and movement and awareness of vibration was normal in 62 of the 65 patients. But information carried by these anterolateral pathways does reach neural levels of consciousness, for with total lesions of the posterior columns, previously reported, touch and pressure are still felt. Itch was removed by division of the anterolateral pathways. Although the posterior columns are essential for discrimination in mechanoreception, discrimination may be disturbed by lesions of the anterolateral pathways, notably two-point discrimination. The evidence on the pathways essential for conveying impulses giving rise to tickle was inconclusive...|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{is given}} of the {{location}} in the spinal cord of man of the central sympathetic fibres supplying vasomotor and sudomotor neurons of the body caudal to the head and neck. The evidence is based on anterolateral cordotomies. The fibres lie within the medial part of the equatorial plane, extending {{from the base of}} the posterior horn and the lateral horn across the medial half of the white matter. The evidence from a previous paper together with that of the present paper is that the pathway maintains this position throughout the spinal cord as far as the L 2 segment. The sympathomotor fibres caudal to the head and neck are supplied from both sides of the cord: sympathetic activity is not removed, although it may be slightly diminished, by a hemisection of the cord. The evidence suggests that sympathetic fibres for vasomotor control leave the cord cranial to the Th 7 segment. The knowledge {{of the location}} of the pathways is of value to neurosurgeons so that they may be avoided in the operation of <b>anterolateral</b> <b>cordotomy...</b>|$|E
40|$|The authors {{present the}} first {{clinical}} implementation of an endoscopic-assisted percutaneous anterolateral radiofrequency cordotomy. The {{aim of this}} article is to demonstrate the intradural endoscopic visualization of the cervical spinal cord via a percutaneous approach to refine the spinal target for <b>anterolateral</b> <b>cordotomy,</b> avoiding undesired trauma to the spinal tissue or injury to blood vessels. Initially, a lateral puncture of the spinal canal in the C 1 - 2 interspace is performed, guided by fluoroscopy. As soon as CSF is reached by the guide cannula (17 -gauge needle), the endoscope can be inserted for visualization of the spinal cord and its surrounding structures. The endoscopic visualization provided clear identification of the pial surface of the spinal cord, arachnoid membrane, dentate ligament, dorsal and ventral root entry zone, and blood vessels. The target for electrode insertion into the spinal cord was determined to be the midpoint from the dentate ligament and the ventral root entry zone. The endoscopic guidance shortened the fluoroscopy usage time and no intrathecal contrast administration was needed. Cordotomy was performed by a standard radiofrequency method after refining of the neurophysiological target. Satisfactory analgesia was provided by the procedure with no additional complications or CSF leak. The initial use of this technique suggests that a percutaneous endoscopic procedure may be useful for particular manipulation of the spinal cord, possibly adding a degree of safety to the procedure and improving its effectiveness.
