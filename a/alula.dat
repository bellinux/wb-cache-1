5|$|At the {{posterior}} {{angle of the}} wing base in some Diptera there {{is a pair of}} membranous lobes (squamae, or calypteres) known as the <b>alula.</b> The <b>alula</b> is well developed in the house fly. The outer squama (c) arises from the wing base behind the third axillary sclerite (3Ax) and evidently represents the jugal lobe of other insects (A, D); the larger inner squama (d) arises from {{the posterior}} scutellar margin of the tergum of the wing-bearing segment and forms a protective, hoodlike canopy over the halter. In the flexed wing the outer squama of the <b>alula</b> is turned upside down above the inner squama, the latter not being affected by the movement of the wing. In many Diptera a deep incision of the anal area of the wing membrane behind the single vannal vein sets off a proximal alar lobe distal to the outer squama of the <b>alula.</b>|$|E
5|$|The area {{above the}} eyes, {{including}} the forehead, crown and nape, {{is a deep}} blue-black, through {{the top edge of}} the mantle. The mantle proper is a medium to dark gray-blue as are the tertials and upperwing-coverts, turning to a dark gray at the median, greater and primary coverts and the <b>alula.</b> The secondaries and inner primaries are fringed in gray-blue. The central rectrices are gray-blue, and the outer rectrices are a blackish-gray, paling towards the tips.|$|E
5|$|Though the broad-billed parrot {{may have}} fed {{on the ground}} and been a weak flier, its tarsometatarsus was short and stout, {{implying}} some arboreal characteristics. The Newton brothers and many authors after them inferred that it was flightless, due to the apparent short wings and large size shown in the 1601 Gelderland sketch. According to Hume, the underlying pencil sketch actually shows that the wings are not particularly short. They appear broad, as they commonly are in forest-adapted species, and the <b>alula</b> appears large, a feature of slow-flying birds. Its sternal keel was reduced, but not enough to prevent flight, as the adept flying Cyanoramphus parrots also have reduced keels, and even the flightless kakapo, with its vestigial keel, is capable of gliding. Furthermore, Hoffman's account states that it could fly, albeit with difficulty, and the first published illustration shows the bird on top of a tree, an improbable position for a flightless bird. The broad-billed parrot may have been behaviourally near-flightless, like the now-extinct Norfolk Island kaka.|$|E

50|$|In the Hewett Treaty, {{concluded}} in 1884, the United Kingdom recognized Bogos and Massawa as possessions of Ethiopia {{in return for}} Ras <b>Alula's</b> help evacuating the Egyptian garrisons of Amedeb, Algeden, Keren, Ghirra, and Gallabat which had been isolated by the Mahdists, and because of these successes the British once more asked for his help against the Mahdists under Osman Digna.|$|R
5|$|The adult green rosella has {{a yellow}} head and underparts with blue cheeks and red band on the {{forehead}} and upper lores. The yellow feathers of the forecrown, lower lores, cheeks, chest and thighs can have red markings, while the yellow feathers of the sides and rear {{of the head and}} neck, and the underparts have dark brown bases. The edges of the feathers on the underparts can be pale brown, resulting in a faint scalloping, which disappears with wear. Some of the yellow feathers of the nape have white bases and when worn, the bird can have a whitish patch on their nape. The yellow {{of the back of the}} head merges indistinctly into the dark plumage of the hindneck, mantle and back, which is black or dark brown with green margins. The feathers of the shoulders are blackish with yellow tips. These margins and tips are often worn by the finish of breeding season, leaving the plumage more solid black. The blue-violet feathers of the chin, throat and cheeks have brown-black bases. The blackish plumage of the back extends to the rump, and the long tail is dark green with brown shafts and dark blue outer feathers and tips. The wings are mostly black and green, with violet-blue marginal coverts, primary coverts, and <b>alula,</b> and blue-tinted dark brown primaries and outer secondaries. Underneath the feathers of the wings are dark brown with blue-violet tips. The iris is brown with a dark grey orbital ring, and the bill is pale-grey, with a dark grey cere. The legs are grey. The yellow plumage of the female is duller and more likely marked with red than that of the male, and the green edges to the black plumage of the upperparts are more prominent.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of the remiges (and <b>alulae)</b> of nestling hoatzins is much delayed compared to the {{development of}} these feathers in other young birds, presumably because young hoatzins are equipped with claws on their first two digits. They use these small rounded hooks to grasp branches when clambering about in trees, and feathering on these digits would presumably interfere with that functionality. Most youngsters shed their claws sometime between their 70th and 100th day of life, but some retain them— though callused-over and unusable— into adulthood.|$|R
25|$|On {{the night}} of 29 February and the early morning of 1 March three Italian brigades {{advanced}} separately towards Adwa over narrow mountain tracks, while a fourth remained camped. David Levering Lewis states that the Italian battle plan: However, the three leading Italian brigades had become separated during their overnight march and at dawn were spread across several miles of very difficult terrain. Their sketchy maps caused Albertone to mistake one mountain for Kidane Meret, and when a scout pointed out his mistake, Albertone advanced directly into Ras <b>Alula's</b> position.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, the Kingdom of Italy {{created a}} modern port in Massawa for their newly {{acquired}} colony of Eritrea. From 1885 - 1897, Massawa (in the Italian spelling: 'Massaua') served as the capital of the region, before Governor Ferdinando Martini moved his administration to Asmara. Ras <b>Alula's</b> attack on nearby Dogali helped precipitate the First Italo-Ethiopian War; the Italians' disastrous defeat at Adwa ended their hopes of expanding further into the Ethiopian highlands for a decade and brought Menelik II's newly formed Ethiopian Empire international recognition.|$|R
25|$|Unbeknownst to General Baratieri, Emperor Menelik {{knew his}} troops had {{exhausted}} {{the ability of}} the local peasants to support them and had planned to break camp the next day (2 March). The Emperor had risen early to begin prayers for divine guidance when spies from Ras <b>Alula,</b> his chief military advisor, brought him news that the Italians were advancing. The Emperor summoned the separate armies of his nobles and with the Empress Taytu beside him, ordered his forces forward. Negus Tekle Haymanot commanded the right wing, Ras <b>Alula</b> the left, and Rasses Makonnen and Mengesha the center, with Ras Mikael {{at the head of the}} Oromo cavalry; the Emperor and his consort remained with the reserve. The Ethiopian forces positioned themselves on the hills overlooking the Adwa valley, in perfect position to receive the Italians, who were exposed and vulnerable to crossfire.|$|E
25|$|In January 1887 Italian {{troops from}} Somalia fought a battle against Ras <b>Alula</b> Engida’s militia in Dogali, Eritrea, where they lost 500 troops. The Prime Minister, Agostino Depretis, {{resigned}} {{because of this}} defeat in July 1887. Francesco Crispi replaced him as Prime Minister. On May 2, 1889, the Ethiopian Emperor Menelik II and Italy signed a peace treaty.|$|E
25|$|The tanker Aris 13, {{which had}} been {{carrying}} fuel from Djibouti to Mogadishu, was hijacked {{off the coast of}} Somalia on 13 March 2017. This was the first reported hijacking of a large commercial vessel in five years. Two skiffs approached the tanker and boarded the vessel off the northern coast of Somalia. Eight Sri Lankan crew members were aboard at the time. After being captured, Aris 13 was taken to <b>Alula</b> and anchored there.|$|E
25|$|On {{the coastal}} plain 20km to <b>Alula's</b> east are found ruins of an ancient {{monument}} in a platform style. The structure is formed by a rectangular dry stone wall that is low in height; the space in between is filled with rubble and manually covered with small stones. Relatively large standing stones are also positioned on the edifice's corners.

5000|$|Augustus Wylde, a {{contemporary}} of the events, described Ras <b>Alula's</b> invaluable {{contribution to this}} critical battle: The Abysssinians never expected to be attacked, and the Italian advance {{would have been a}} complete surprise, {{had it not been for}} Ras Aloula, who never believed the Italian officials, and would never trust them. Two of his spies observed the Italians leave Entiscio, and arrived by a circuitous route, and informed Ras Aloula, who was one mile to the north of Adi-Aboona, that the enemy was on the march to Adowa. The Ras immediately informed King Menelik and the other leaders, and the Abyssinians prepared for battle, sending out strong scouting parties in all directions in front of their positions towards Entiscio.|$|R
5000|$|As a {{very large}} group of birds, enantiornitheans {{displayed}} a high diversity of different body plans based on differences in ecology and feeding, reflected in an equal diversity of wing forms, many paralleling adaptions to different lifestyles seen in modern birds. In general, the wings of enantiornitheans were advanced compared to more primitive avialans like Archaeopteryx, and displayed some features related to flight {{similar to those found}} in the lineage leading to modern birds, the Ornithuromorpha. While most enantiornitheans had claws on at least some of their fingers, many species had shortened hands, a highly mobile shoulder joint, and proportional changes in the wing bones similar to modern birds. Like modern birds, enantiornitheans had <b>alulas,</b> or [...] "bastard wings", small forward-pointing arrangements of feathers on the first digit that granted higher maneuverability in the air and aided in precise landings.|$|R
25|$|The Mekwanint were {{officials}} {{who had been}} granted specific offices in the Abyssinian government or court. Higher ranks from the title of Ras through to Balambaras were also bestowed upon members of the Mekwanint. A member of the Mesafint, however, would traditionally be given precedence over {{a member of the}} Mekwanint of the same rank. For example, Ras Mengesha Yohannes, son of Emperor Yohannes IV and thus a member of the Mesafint, would have outranked Ras <b>Alula</b> Engida, who was of humble birth and therefore a member of the Mekwanint, even though their ranks were equal.|$|E
25|$|The {{style is}} also often {{associated}} in Argentina with the californiano ("Californian"), another vernacular type of house close {{connected with the}} American mission style. Mar del Plata's features, however, {{are closely related to}} the picturesque architecture, already popular among the upper-class people who used to spend summertime in this resort city between 1910 and 1930, and to the American craftsman style. The precursor of the style was the Italian-born engineer <b>Alula</b> Baldassarini, who popularized the use of stone on the frontispieces in 1925. Some of this early examples were labeled chalet inglés ("English chalet"), a type of bungalow or cottage which flourished between 1925 and 1935. Baldassarini also developed a technique known as bastón roto ("broken stick"), which consisted in rectangular stone bricks irregularly arranged on vertical and horizontal joints.|$|E
25|$|Stephen Czerkas, Gregory S. Paul, {{and others}} {{have argued that the}} fact Microraptor could fly and yet is also very clearly a dromaeosaurid {{suggests}} that the Dromaeosauridae, including later and larger species such as Deinonychus, were secondarily flightless. The work of Xu and colleagues also suggested that the ancestors of dromaeosaurids were probably small, arboreal, and capable of gliding, although later discoveries of more primitive dromaeosaurids with short forelimbs unsuitable for gliding have cast doubt on this view. Work done on the question of flight ability in other paravians, however, showed that most of them probably {{would not have been able}} to achieve enough lift for powered flight, given their limited flight strokes and relatively smaller wings. These studies concluded that Microraptor probably evolved flight and its associated features (fused sternum, <b>alula,</b> etc.) independently of the ancestors of birds.|$|E
25|$|At the Battle of Adwa, Ethiopian {{fighters from}} all parts of the country rallied to the cause and took up {{positions}} on the battlefield that allowed them to come to each other's aid during combat. Armies who participated in the battle includes Negu Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam's Amhara infantry and cavalary; Ras Mengesha Yohannes' and Ras <b>Alula’s</b> Tigrayan army; Ras Makonnen Wolde Mikael’s Harar army that included Amhara, Oromo and Gurage soldiers; Ras Mikael’s mainly muslim Wallo cavalary; Fitawrari Tekle’s Wallaga Cavalary and infantry; Wag-shum Gwangul’s Agaw and Amhara from Wag and Lasta; and Ras Wolle Bitul’s Gondar army that also included Muslim-Christian cavalary from Yejju and Borana Wallo. The mehal sefari or central fighting unit included mostly Shewan Amhara, Mecha-Tulama Oromo cavalary, Gurage as well as Taytu Bitul’s Yejju armies. The Fitawrari’s army, normally the leader of the advanced guard, was commanded by Gebeyehu Gorra. The Ethiopian army at Adwa was, therefore, a mosaic of various ethnic groups and tribes that marched north for a common, national cause.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the night}} of 29 February and the early morning of 1 March three Italian brigades {{advanced}} separately towards Adwa over narrow mountain tracks, while a fourth remained camped. David Levering Lewis states that the Italian battle plan: called for three columns to march in parallel formation to the crests of three mountains — Dabormida commanding on the right, Albertone on the left, and Arimondi in the center — with a reserve under Ellena following behind Arimondi. The supporting crossfire each column could give the others made the 'soldiers as deadly as razored shears'. Albertone's brigade was to set the pace for the others. He was to position himself on the summit known as Kidane Mehret, which would give the Italians the high ground from which to meet the Ethiopians. [...] However, the three leading Italian brigades had become separated during their overnight march and at dawn were spread across several miles of very difficult terrain. Their sketchy maps caused Albertone to mistake one mountain for Kidane Meret, and when a scout pointed out his mistake, Albertone advanced directly into Ras <b>Alula's</b> position.|$|R
50|$|In northeastern Somalia, on {{the coastal}} plain 20 km to <b>Alula's</b> east are found ruins of an ancient {{monument}} in a platform style.

Additionally, around 200 stone monuments (taalos) are found in the northeastern Botiala site, most of which consist of cairns. There are a number of rows of standing stones on {{the eastern side of the}} structures, which are similar to those at Salweyn, a great cairn-held situated close to Heis. Besides cairns, the Botiala area also features a few other drystone monuments. These include disc monuments with circular, ground-level features, as well as low, rectangular platform monuments. Burial sites near Burao in the northwestern part of the country likewise feature a number of old stelae.|$|R

500|$|Also, bastard wing; alular digit; alular quills. A small, freely-moving {{projection}} on {{the anterior}} {{edge of the}} wing of modern birds (and a few non-avian dinosaurs)—a bird's [...] "thumb"—the word is Latin and means [...] "winglet"; it is the diminutive of ala, meaning [...] "wing". <b>Alula</b> typically bears three to five small , with the exact number depending on the species.

50|$|Following Britain's {{complete}} {{occupation of}} Egypt {{and the rising}} of the Mahdi in the Sudan, the Egyptian fort at Gura was among those detailed in the 1884 tripartite Hewett Treaty. The treaty, signed at Adwa and ratified by Queen Victoria, obliged Ethiopia to oversee the evacuation of exposed Egyptian garrisons in Eritrea and the southern Sudan through the port of Massawa {{in exchange for the}} garrisons' supplies of arms and ammunition, recognition of their sovereignty over the Bogos lands—essentially, the highlands of modern Eritrea, which the Ethiopians organized as Hamasien,—and other concessions. During this period, Gura served as Ras <b>Alula's</b> capital of the Ethiopian province of Hamasien prior to his removal to Asmara. Once Ethiopia had made good on its part of the bargain, however, Britain's concern over France's rapid expansion of its colony in the Bay of Tadjoura (today's Djibouti) led it to openly support Italy's bloodless occupation of Massawa and establishment of Italian Eritrea in the former Egyptian lands. Gura was occupied by the Italian-allied Bahta Hagos in 1889. The Battle of Adwa ending the First Italo-Ethiopian War kept it from annexing the entirety of Ethiopia but it continued to hold Gura and other towns in the former Egyptian highlands.|$|R

Megh also lashed the coast with strong waves, and the combination with rainfall damaged several boats. The rains led to flash flooding that blocked roads. Megh damaged schools, police stations, and the main hospital in <b>Alula</b> District. The passage of Megh also resulted in the loss of livestock in the region, and many fruit and palm trees were knocked down. After the passages of earlier Cyclone Chapala and Megh, the local Red Cross chapter distributed blankets, sleeping mats, and mattresses to the affected families.|$|E
500|$|The nelicourvi weaver is {{a slender}} sparrow-like bird of [...] long and {{weighing}} [...] During the breeding period, the male has a black beak, (reddish) {{brown eyes and}} blackish to brownish grey legs.

2500|$|Unlike {{some more}} {{advanced}} birds, Confuciusornis lacked an <b>alula,</b> or [...] "bastard wing". In modern birds this is formed by feathers {{anchored to the}} first digit of the hand, but this digit {{appears to have been}} free of feathers and independent of the body of the wing in Confuciusornis. According to Dieter Stefan Peters to compensate for the lack of an <b>alula,</b> the third finger might have formed a separate winglet below the main wing, functioning like the flap of an aircraft. Despite the relatively advanced and long wing feathers, the forearm bones lacked any indication of quill knobs (papillae ulnares), or bony attachment points for the feather ligaments.|$|E
