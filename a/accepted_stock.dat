The profiles of already listed shipping companies were studied and conclusions were drawn about the characteristics which make the shares of such companies attractive.

Merger waves and waves of cash and stock purchases can be rationally driven by periods of over and under valuation of the stock market. Thus, valuation fundamentally impacts mergers.

If a purely length-dependent etiology for diabetic sensory polyneuropathy were true, then a validated comparison of sensory loss at any equidistant site about the fore-foot will reveal findings consistent with the <b>accepted</b> <b>stocking</b> pattern of anes-thesia. A single-blinded, age-matched, control/experimental study is made into the frequency of apparent purely length-dependent A-beta fiber pathol-ogy in developing diabetic sensory polyneuropathy. Control (n = 46) and experimental (n = 83) central US sub-jects are examined with a subjective neuropathy screening questionnaire, vibratory threshold, and single-point pressure threshold testing. There is a plantar predominant pattern (61. 5 %) of sensory loss in develop-ing diabetic sensory polyneuropathy, even after adjusting for sensitivity dif-ferences between {{different areas of the}} foot. A typical stocking pattern of sen-sory loss was not found. Although axo-nal pathology is length dependent, it is not apparently a purely length-dependent process. Therefore, a purely metabolic explanation for sensory loss is unlikely. In addition, an anatomic component for A-beta fiber pathology is implied by this study...|$|R
