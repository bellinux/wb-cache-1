25|$|Subjectivity {{comes with}} {{consciousness}} {{of myself as}} a self. It encompasses the emotional and intellectual resources that the individual is born with. Subjectivity is what the individual is as a human being. Now the problem of subjectivity is to decide how to choose—what rules or models is the individual going to use to make the right choices? What are the right choices? Who defines right? To be truly an individual, to be true to himself, his actions should in some way be expressed so that they describe who and what he is to himself <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>others.</b> The problem, according to Kierkegaard, is that we must choose who and what we will be based on subjective interests—the individual must make choices that will mean something to him as a reasoning, feeling being.|$|E
25|$|The Cross of Sacrifice is {{considered}} one of the great pieces of war-related art. Its enduring popularity, historian Allen Frantzen says, is because it is both simple and expressive, its abstraction reflecting the modernity people valued after the war. Fabian Ware argued that its greatness was because its symbolism is so purposefully vague: To some, it is a Christian cross; to others, the stone is irrelevant and the sword itself is the cross; <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>others,</b> the artwork symbolizes those who sacrificed their lives to the sword. The theme of sacrifice is commonly seen in the piece. Jeroen Geurst points out that Lutyens' War Stone unsettlingly brings to mind images of soldiers sacrificed on the altar of war, while Blomfield's cross speaks about self-sacrifice and the saving grace of Jesus Christ's sacrifice.|$|E

25|$|A famous puzzle {{in human}} {{genetics}} is the genetic ability to taste phenylthiocarbamide (phenylthiourea or PTC), a morphism which {{was discovered in}} 1931. This substance, which to some of us is bitter, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>others</b> tasteless, is of no great significance in itself, yet it is a genetic dimorphism. Because of its high frequency (which varies in different ethnic groups) it must be connected to some function of selective value. The ability to taste PTC itself is correlated {{with the ability to}} taste other bitter substances, many of which are toxic. Indeed, PTC itself is toxic, though not at the level of tasting it on litmus. Variation in PTC perception may reflect variation in dietary preferences throughout human evolution, and might correlate with susceptibility to diet-related diseases in modern populations. There is a statistical correlation between PTC tasting and liability to thyroid disease.|$|E
25|$|Same-sex alliances do {{not need}} to be sexual in nature, {{although}} when competition for partners is especially severe the sexualisation of same-sex alliances occur more often. Displays of commitment between partners are adaptive because of the cost in terms of efforts invested in maintaining the alliance. Sex could be argued as a type of currency in long-term relationships, and signify to an individual’s partner <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>others</b> a prominent level of connection and commitment, and homosexual/homoerotic behaviour become significant representation of one’s loyalty and affiliation in a same-sex alliance. Ultimately, homoerotic behaviour is not selectively disadvantaged, as homoerotic behaviour does not result in a net decrease to an individual’s reproductive success, and the attraction to other individuals of same sex and the behaviour as result of that attraction is not contrary or alternative to the attraction to people of the other sex.|$|E
25|$|When {{compared}} with benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepines (including zaleplon) appear to offer few significant advantages in efficacy or tolerability among elderly individuals. Long-term use of sedative/hypnotics for insomnia {{has traditionally been}} discouraged for reasons that include concerns about such potential adverse drug effects as cognitive impairment, anterograde amnesia, daytime sedation, musculoskeletal impairment, and subsequently {{an increased risk of}} harm to oneself (e.g. falling) <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>others</b> (e.g. automotive accidents). Though, quite obviously as the body and brain age, these aforementioned phenomena are expected events, as they occur daily regardless of ingestion of a sedative/hypnotic. Thus, statistically significant and empirical evidence are arguably still absent as dramatic precautions and conclusions are drawn irrespective of the debilitating realities that accompany insomnia and the fact that these medicines do indeed provide assistance to millions of elderly individuals. It is important to distinguish between the extrapolation of potential side effects relative to the vast number of examples, wherein the sedative/hypnotic has proven therapeutically beneficial and appropriate.|$|E

25|$|Aesthetic {{collections}} : Some collections {{consist of}} coins which could {{fit into the}} other categories, and on coin grading may be graded poorly due to not conforming to their systems. These collections {{are made up of}} coins which are pleasing to the owner <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>others</b> not due to perfect condition, but rather due to the uniqueness of the coin based on several factors. These can include patinas which form from being exposed to acidic or basic environments (such as soil, when coins are excavated), and warping or wearing which come from use in circulation. Very interesting patinas and patterns can form on coins which have been naturally expose to environments which can affect the contents of the coin. Examples include naturally blackened Victorian pennies, which have only the most raised surface showing the underlying copper, meaning that the head is clearly presented. Many collectors often find discolored coins from the same year which are remarkably different, which makes for added categorization and enjoyment.|$|E
500|$|Associates are celibate {{faithful}} {{who make}} themselves fully available to God <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>others</b> in apostolic celibacy, and stably take {{on at least}} one (sometimes more) apostolic assignment(s) from the Prelature in giving doctrinal and ascetical formation and/or coordinating activities. They differ from numeraries in not making themselves [...] "fully" [...] available to staff the official undertakings of the Prelature, instead giving themselves in additional social realities, such as through their profession or to their own families. Because of this difference in availability for the official activities of Opus Dei, unlike numeraries the associates do not live in Opus Dei centers but maintain their own abodes. [...] Some of their family life (emotional and social support) comes from the centers of Opus Dei, some from other associates of Opus Dei, and some from their personal families and friends; the precise ratio of this distribution depends upon the circumstances of the individual associate.|$|E
500|$|Furthermore, {{despite the}} novel's {{thematic}} focus on racial injustice, its black characters {{are not fully}} examined. In its use of racial epithets, stereotyped depictions of superstitious blacks, and Calpurnia, who to some critics is {{an updated version of}} the [...] "contented slave" [...] motif <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>others</b> simply unexplored, the book is viewed as marginalizing black characters. One writer asserts that the use of Scout's narration serves as a convenient mechanism for readers to be innocent and detached from the racial conflict. Scout's voice [...] "functions as the not-me which allows the rest of us—black and white, male and female—to find our relative position in society". A teaching guide for the novel published by The English Journal cautions, [...] "what seems wonderful or powerful to one group of students may seem degrading to another". A Canadian language arts consultant found that the novel resonated well with white students, but that black students found it [...] "demoralizing". Another criticism, articulated by Michael Lind, is that the novel indulges in classist stereotyping and demonization of poor rural [...] "white trash".|$|E

He wrote that the episode showed how Torres becomes [...] "responsible to herself <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>others</b> - no matter the risk - while choosing to live". Writer Paul Ruditis viewed the emphasis on Torres' [...] "duality of nature" [...] as leading {{to the development of}} several episodes prominently showcasing her character, including [...] "Barge of the Dead". Ruditis connected Torres' storyline to Seven of Nine's in [...] "Survival Instinct", writing that they both [...] "deal with issues of life and death, with dramatic results". He referred to [...] "Barge of the Dead" [...] and [...] "Survival Instinct" [...] as [...] "equally dark episodes". [...] "Barge of the Dead" [...] was also one of three episodes that featured Torres' relationship with her parents, with the [...] episodes [...] "" [...] and [...] "" [...] resolving her estrangement from her father.|$|E
