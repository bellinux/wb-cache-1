Typically, systems <b>as</b> <b>weak</b> as landspouts and gustnadoes can rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending rear flank downdraft (RFD) in a cyclonic supercell. On rare occasions, anticyclonic tornadoes form {{in association with the}} mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, {{in the same manner as}} the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornado either as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{justice is}} costly to provide and many legal systems, {{especially}} in Asia, are fraught with issues such <b>as</b> <b>weak</b> legal institutions, corrupt and incompetent administrative officers and judges, excessive delays and {{limited access to}} justice stemming from high legal costs {{and the lack of}} legal aid. It was agreed during the World Justice Forum in 2008 that access to justice is key to advancing the rule of law.|$|E
5|$|In {{a number}} of countries, mainly in Asia, {{legislation}} or corporate practice has introduced formal menstrual leave to provide women with either paid or unpaid {{leave of absence from}} their employment while they are menstruating. Countries with policies include Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, and South Korea. The practice is controversial due to concerns that it bolsters the perception of women <b>as</b> <b>weak,</b> inefficient workers, as well as concerns that it is unfair to men.|$|E

5|$|Metalloids usually {{look like}} metals but behave largely like nonmetals. Physically, they are shiny, brittle solids with {{intermediate}} to relatively good electrical conductivity and the electronic band {{structure of a}} semimetal or semiconductor. Chemically, they mostly behave <b>as</b> (<b>weak)</b> nonmetals, have intermediate ionization energies and electronegativity values, and amphoteric or weakly acidic oxides. They can form alloys with metals. Most of their other {{physical and chemical properties}} are intermediate in nature.|$|E
5|$|The {{benzodiazepine}} {{class of}} drugs also interact with peripheral benzodiazepine receptors. Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors {{are present in}} peripheral nervous system tissues, glial cells, {{and to a lesser}} extent the central nervous system. These peripheral receptors are not structurally related or coupled to GABAA receptors. They modulate the immune system and are involved in the body response to injury. Benzodiazepines also function <b>as</b> <b>weak</b> adenosine reuptake inhibitors. It has been suggested that some of their anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and muscle relaxant effects may be in part mediated by this action.|$|E

Odahviing agrees {{to fly the}} player to Skuldafn, {{claiming}} Alduin has shown himself <b>as</b> <b>weak</b> and undeserving of leadership over the dragon race by fleeing from the Dragonborn. The player enters Sovngarde and travels to the Hall of Valor. There, they meet up with the three heroes of Nordic legend who defeated Alduin originally. With their help, the player defeats Alduin once and for all.|$|E

5|$|Early on June17, the JTWC {{issued a}} second TCFA {{as the system}} {{continued}} to organize. By this time the system was nearly stationary and at 0600UTC, the JMA declared that the low had developed into a tropical depression. Several hours later, the JTWC designated the system as Tropical Depression 03W while the storm was situated about 705km (440mi) south-southwest of Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Little movement took place {{for the first few}} days of the storm's existence <b>as</b> <b>weak</b> steering currents were in place over the South China Sea. Following further development of the depression, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm late on June17. At 0600UTC on June18, the JMA classified the system as a tropical storm and gave it the name Linfa. Limited poleward outflow hindered intensification for the remainder of June18. By this time, the storm began to increase in forward motion due to a strengthening subtropical ridge located east of Taiwan and a mid-latitude trough to the west.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XIII-2 {{received}} highly positive {{reviews from}} Japanese critics and generally positive reviews from Western video game journalists. Though praised for its gameplay, lack of linearity, and graphics, the game's story was criticized <b>as</b> <b>weak</b> and confusing. During {{the first week}} of sales in Japan, the game sold 524,000 units, becoming the fifth-best selling game of 2011 in Japan, and sold 3.1 million copies worldwide by January 2013. It was released digitally for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in June 2013 along with a Japan-only re-release including all downloadable content. iOS and Android versions were released in Japan in 2015. The Microsoft Windows version has sold over 400,000 copies according to SteamSpy. A sequel, , was released in November 2013 in Japan and February 2014 in North America, Europe and Australia.

5|$|In 993, the Chola Emperor Rajaraja I invaded Sri Lanka, {{forcing the}} then Sri Lankan ruler Mahinda V {{to flee to}} the {{southern}} part of the country. The Mahavamsa describes the rule of Mahinda V <b>as</b> <b>weak,</b> and the country was suffering from poverty by this time. It further mentions that his army rose against him due to lack of wages. Taking advantage of this situation, Rajendra I son of Rajaraja I, launched a large invasion in 1017. Mahinda V was captured and taken to India, and the Cholas sacked the city of Anuradhapura. They moved the capital to Polonnaruwa and subsequent Sri Lankan rulers who came into power after the Chola reign continued to use Polonnaruwa as the capital, thus ending the Anuradhapura Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The filmmaker Derek Jarman {{adapted the}} Marlowe play into a film in 1991, {{creating}} a postmodern pastiche of the original, depicting Edward as a strong, explicitly homosexual leader, ultimately overcome by powerful enemies. In Jarman's version, Edward finally escapes captivity, following the {{tradition in the}} Fieschi letter. Edward's current popular image was also shaped by his contrasting appearance in Mel Gibson's 1995 film Braveheart, where he is portrayed <b>as</b> <b>weak</b> and implicitly homosexual, wearing silk clothes and heavy makeup, shunning the company of women and incapable of dealing militarily with the Scots. The film received extensive criticism, both for its historical inaccuracies and for its negative portrayal of homosexuality.|$|E

He is seen <b>as</b> <b>weak</b> due to his girlish {{appearance}} and physical build but is very straightforward and has more common sense than most of his friends. He {{is a member of}} a group of friends called the Little Busters, which originally consisted of four members, but expanded to five with Riki during his childhood. The leader of the Little Busters is Kyousuke Natsume, who is the eldest member. He often comes up with absurd ideas, but almost always follows up with a reasonable explanation along with it.|$|E

Heading northwestward, the system brushed the Yucatan Peninsula <b>as</b> <b>weak</b> tropical storm. Late on September11, it peaked with maximum sustained winds of 50mph (85km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of , while located in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. Early on September13, the storm re-curved northeastward and began weakening. At 0600UTC on September13, it made landfall near Venice, Louisiana at the same intensity. The storm weakened slightly and briefly moved offshore, before making another landfall near Ocean Springs, Mississippi with winds of 40mph (65km/h).|$|E
5|$|In {{summing up}} the counterattack, US Army {{official}} historian John Miller {{argues that the}} Japanese offensive failed due to poor planning and intelligence. The Japanese commanders underestimated {{the strength of the}} US defenders, but even if XIV Corps had been <b>as</b> <b>weak</b> as the Japanese believed, the force committed to the attack did not include enough troops or artillery to penetrate the well-prepared defenses. In the event, the defenders greatly outnumbered the Japanese force and had far superior artillery support. Miller argues further that the attack might have achieved a degree of success, {{at least in terms of}} inflicting heavy casualties on the US forces, had Hyakutake concentrated his forces early in the attack, rather than cumulatively, in order to achieve a break in the US line, which he might have been able to exploit to penetrate into the rear areas and cause considerable destruction before the US forces regrouped. Nevertheless, this did not happen and ultimately the veteran US troops held their positions despite the onslaught. Miller opines that had the offensive been successful, it would have had a serious affect on the campaign in the Solomons, resulting in a large drain on Allied resources, but would most likely not have altered the wider course of the war.|$|E

She {{tells them}} both {{she will not}} kill herself, and after {{settling}} old feuds with Dot, Stacey and Sharon, Peggy receives a vision of her old friend Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement). She decides {{she wants to be}} remembered as a strong woman, not <b>as</b> <b>weak</b> in her bed, and takes a lethal overdose of pills that she hid from her sons and dies in her sleep that night. Phil is devastated to find her body, and a letter from her urges him to love himself as others love him. Peggy's funeral takes place on 4 July 2016, and Phil is due to do a eulogy to her there but gets too emotional and runs home. Sharon later calms him down by revealing that Peggy was the one who sent Eric to prison when Phil was a child, not corrupt police officers as he was previously told, and that she did it to protect him. Phil later works up the courage to finish his eulogy to Peggy at the wake, and then returns to her grave at the church to finish his goodbyes to her, unaware that Grant has secretly left a rose at the grave.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression was experiencing slight easterly wind shear, which distorted the convection {{to the west}} of the circulation. However, favorable conditions for strengthening were expected, and the depression was forecast to reach peak winds of 50mph (85km/h) before weakening. It tracked slowly northwestward along the southern periphery of a ridge, and quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Kristy after convection increased over its circulation center. By that time, wind shear had decreased to very low levels, and with very warm waters, the storm was expected to quickly intensify to reach hurricane status. By late on August30, the convection was wrapping into the center while an eye feature became intermittent. Organization continued, and Kristy attained hurricane status early on August31, about 30hours after forming. Six hours after attaining hurricane status, an eye-like featured was evident on satellite imagery, and it is estimated Kristy attained peak winds of 80mph (130km/h) about 550mi (880km) southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California. However, satellite-derived intensity estimates suggested the hurricane could have been as strong as 105mph (170km/h), or <b>as</b> <b>weak</b> as a tropical storm.|$|E
