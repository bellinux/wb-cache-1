5|$|Concerned {{over the}} losses to his carrier fighter {{aircraft}} strength, <b>anxious</b> {{about the threat}} to his carriers from further Japanese air attacks, and worried about his ships' fuel levels, Fletcher {{announced that he would}} be withdrawing his carrier task forces on the evening of August 8.|$|E
5|$|Great Auk calls {{included}} low croaking and {{a hoarse}} scream. A captive great auk was observed making a gurgling noise when <b>anxious.</b> It {{is not known}} what its other vocalizations were, but {{it is believed that}} they were {{similar to those of the}} razorbill, only louder and deeper.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds {{of spectators}} had slept on wet {{pavements}} outside the stadium in rainy weather {{on the eve}} of the Test to queue for tickets. Bradman had announced his forthcoming retirement at the end of the season, so the public were <b>anxious</b> to witness his last appearance at Test level.|$|E
5|$|I was <b>anxious</b> {{that such}} details {{should be put}} on record because some of these {{regional}} cooking pots are already becoming {{very hard to find}} in France, so that in some sense Juliet Renny's drawings constitute a little historical record in their own right.|$|E
5|$|In a post-race {{press conference}} {{after winning the}} 2015 Belmont Stakes, Zayat stated {{that he was so}} <b>anxious</b> about American Pharoah's {{upcoming}} race that he neglected to bet on anything.|$|E
5|$|In {{depressed}} {{people who}} experience symptoms of sleepiness and fatigue, bupropion {{has been found}} to be more effective than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in alleviating these symptoms. There appears to be a modest advantage for the SSRIs over bupropion in the treatment of <b>anxious</b> depression.|$|E
5|$|Mood is {{described}} using the patient's own words, {{and can also}} be described in summary terms such as neutral, euthymic, dysphoric, euphoric, angry, <b>anxious</b> or apathetic. Alexithymic individuals {{may be unable to}} describe their subjective mood state. An individual who is unable to experience any pleasure may be suffering from anhedonia.|$|E
5|$|Now I beseech {{the ancient}} fathers with Peter their leader {{on behalf of}} wretched and <b>anxious</b> me: pour out your prayers and aid so that the trinal {{custodian}} of each new saint may afterwards forgive me until I may overcome the hideous enemy of this world.|$|E
5|$|Prussia became <b>anxious</b> at Austrian {{advances}} on the Rhine frontier, and Frederick again invaded Bohemia, {{beginning a}} Second Silesian War; Prussian troops sacked Prague in August 1744. The French plans fell apart when Charles Albert died in January 1745. The French overran the Austrian Netherlands in May.|$|E
5|$|Since January 1691 Marlborough {{had been}} in contact with the exiled JamesII in Saint-Germain, <b>anxious</b> to obtain the {{erstwhile}} King's pardon for deserting him in 1688a pardon essential for the success of his future career in the not altogether unlikely event of a Jacobite restoration.|$|E

After being nearly hit by a refreshment cart, Charlie rushes to a seat several rows back and straps himself in as the plane shakes.|$|E
5|$|By March 1905, Potter was <b>anxious</b> {{to begin}} work on the tale. She thought the 1903 version too thin and rewrote the entire story, {{retaining}} Ribby the cat and Duchess the dog as the central characters while elaborating the setting and developing a stronger plot line. It was decided the tale would be published in a format slightly larger than her previous productions with ten full-colour illustrations and other illustrations in pen and sepia ink.|$|E
5|$|For a time, Duyệt's {{attitude}} and stature {{in the south}} forced Minh Mạng to moderate his policies and allow the preaching of Christian missionaries. However, it also increased {{the tension between the}} pair and Minh Mạng was <b>anxious</b> to curtail the autonomy that his father had granted to Duyệt and the southerners. The emperor began to slowly wind back their military powers, in an attempt to wear down Duyệt's power base by gradually removing the general's close aides.|$|E
5|$|His {{studies had}} {{impressed}} the Lucasian professor Isaac Barrow, {{who was more}} <b>anxious</b> to develop his own religious and administrative potential (he became master of Trinity two years later); in 1669 Newton succeeded him, only one year after receiving his MA. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1672.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, Childe left Edinburgh {{to take up}} the {{position}} as Director and Professor of European Prehistory at the Institute of Archaeology (IOA) in London. <b>Anxious</b> to return to the capital, he had kept silent over his disapproval of government policies so {{that he would not be}} prevented from getting the job. He took up residence at Lawn Road Flats near to Hampstead.|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, it was {{claimed that}} as many as 10,000 {{visitors}} passed through the Vatican Museums in a day and that the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel is the biggest attraction. The Vatican, <b>anxious</b> at the possibility that the newly restored frescoes will suffer damage, announced plans to reduce visiting hours and raise the price in an attempt to discourage visitors.|$|E
5|$|Kusanagi {{follows the}} car {{carrying}} {{the body to}} an abandoned building.

5|$|Mild {{impairment}} {{of attention and}} concentration may occur in any mental illness where people are <b>anxious</b> and distractible (including psychotic states), but more extensive cognitive abnormalities are likely to indicate a gross disturbance of brain functioning such as delirium, dementia or intoxication. Specific language abnormalities {{may be associated with}} pathology in Wernicke's area or Broca's area of the brain. In Korsakoff's syndrome there is dramatic memory impairment with relative preservation of other cognitive functions.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{meetings}} and conferences of discontented workers continued across the country. A committee representing the strikers (including engineers, conductors, firemen, and brakemen) departed Baltimore to ensure solidarity along the line in demanding $2 per hour. According to the edition of July 20 of The Sun, the city was peaceful, but <b>anxious,</b> as many awaited word of the happenings in Martinsburg, which {{was seen as the}} central point of the movement.|$|E
5|$|On 12 March, news of Victor's {{defeat at}} the Battle of Barrosa reached Soult {{and he left}} Badajoz to return to Andalusia, <b>anxious</b> that the siege of Cádiz had been lifted. Reaching Seville on 20 March he was {{relieved}} to find that Victor's siege lines still held and Andalusia remained under French control. Before his departure Soult had consolidated his gains in Extremadura by garrisoning Badajoz with 11,000 French troops {{under the command of}} Marshal Édouard Mortier.|$|E
5|$|Still in 357, Julian {{followed}} up the battle by an incursion into Alamanni territory beyond the Rhine. After ravaging the lands far and wide, he set about rebuilding a fort in the Agri Decumates (Black Forest) originally built by Trajan {{in the early}} 2nd century. He then granted the <b>anxious</b> barbarians a 10-month truce.|$|E
5|$|The Hastings line {{is built}} over the difficult, forested, and hilly terrain across the High Weald and {{sandstone}} Hastings Beds, necessitating the construction of eight tunnels between Tonbridge and the south coast seaside resort of Hastings. The SER was <b>anxious</b> to construct the line as economically as possible, since it was in competition with the LBSC to obtain entry into Hastings and {{was not in a}} strong financial position in the mid 1840s.|$|E
5|$|To {{compound}} {{the agony of}} his defeat, Adams' son Charles, a long-time alcoholic, died in late November. <b>Anxious</b> to rejoin Abigail, who had already left for Massachusetts, Adams departed the White House in the predawn hours of March 4, 1801, and did not attend Jefferson's inauguration. Since him, only three out-going presidents (having served a full term) have not attended their successor's inauguration.|$|E
25|$|Dhat syndrome, another {{condition}} {{that occurs in}} men, is a culture-bound syndrome which causes <b>anxious</b> and dysphoric mood after sex.|$|E

25|$|In general, all antidepressants, {{including}} mirtazapine, require {{at least}} a week for their therapeutic benefits on depressive and <b>anxious</b> symptoms to become apparent.|$|E
25|$|Any {{exercise}} for dogs, including with the flirt pole, helps release <b>anxious</b> energy (which leads to destructive behaviors) {{and to maintain}} healthy body functions.|$|E
25|$|Laurent {{carefully}} {{closed the}} door behind him and remained there a moment, leaning against it, staring into the room with an <b>anxious,</b> confused expression.|$|E
25|$|To better {{elucidate}} {{the findings of}} thought suppression, several studies have changed the target thought. Roemer and Borkovec found that participants who suppressed <b>anxious</b> or depressing thoughts showed a significant rebound effect. Furthermore, Wenzlaff, Wegner, & Roper demonstrated that <b>anxious</b> or depressed subjects {{were less likely to}} suppress negative, unwanted thoughts. Despite Rassin, Merkelbach and Muris reporting that this finding is moderately robust in the literature, some studies were unable to replicate results. However, this may be explained by a consideration of individual differences.|$|E
25|$|The {{artist was}} always {{available}} and <b>anxious</b> {{to discuss his}} work with visitors, and could often be found toiling with new artwork in the gallery.|$|E
25|$|Dom DeLuise as Itchy Itchiford, a paranoid, <b>anxious</b> but loyal Dachshund. DeLuise reprised {{his role}} in All Dogs Go To Heaven 2, the series and An All Dogs Christmas Carol.|$|E

25|$|Substance abuse, {{especially}} {{long-term abuse}} can cause multiple mental disorders. Alcoholism {{is linked to}} depression while abuse of amphetamines and LSD can leave a person feeling paranoid and <b>anxious.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Hawaiian {{women are}} <b>anxious</b> {{to vote and}} {{they are ready to}} do all they can to gain equal suffrage. One of the members said {{yesterday}} that up to the present time the native women have not known just what steps to take and therefore have made no progress but she said that with Mrs. Dowsett as the president they feel that the cause will surely advance. All of the members are <b>anxious</b> to be active and want to arouse Interest among all {{of the women in the}} city irrespective of nationality.|$|E
