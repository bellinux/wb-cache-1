40|$|The Feedback Cello {{is a new}} electroacoustic {{actuated}} {{instrument in}} which feedback can be induced independently on each string. Built from retro-fitted acoustic cellos, the signals from electromagnetic pickups sitting under each string are passed to a speaker built {{into the back of}} the instrument and to transducers clamped in varying places across the instrument body. Placement of acoustic and mechanical actuators on the resonant body of the cello mean that this simple <b>analogue</b> <b>feedback</b> system is capable of a wide range of complex self-resonating behaviours. This paper describes the motivations for building these instruments as both a physical extension to live coding practice and an electroacoustic augmentation of cello. The design and physical construction is outlined, and modes of performance described with reference to the first six months of performances and installations. Future developments and planned investigations are outlined...|$|E

By prototyping interactions with simple everyday analogue materials, the goal was to explore playful, tangible input methods for our interface, beyond a more conventional screen-based approach that could inform future development of a digital map-based feedback interface. Four different prototype interactions were developed that could work in a completely analogue implementation. These interactions were installed and evaluated as part of an in-the-wild deployment of a larger project, which was used as part of a community consultation process. By analysing how people used our interaction prototypes and the feedback that they left, data was collected to inform later iterations with the kinds of interaction approaches that can successfully engage participants and the most effective methods of soliciting feedback...|$|R

40|$|CSIRO Building, Construction and Engineering has {{conducted}} {{research on the}} active attenuation of windows {{for the last three}} years. The initial idea was to use piezo-electric film adhered to both sides of a single sheet of glass. The polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) pieze-electric film is clear and CSIRO Telecommunications and Industrial Physics successfully deposited experimental clear electrodes on a small sample of PVDF film. Unfortunately the sound levels that could be cancelled were not high enough to justify the commercial cost. Experimentation was then switched to double-glazed windows whose cavity was driven by a horn loudspeaker driver unit. The sound levels that could be cancelled were sufficiently high. Successful feed forward control of a periodic signal was achieved using software from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Adelaide. Unfortunately, no feed forward control achieved with random noise or traffic noise. <b>Analogue</b> <b>feedback</b> control was then used with random noise and gave some attenuation at some frequencies.

40|$|This {{research}} examines some of {{the ways}} to design a digital control system with particular reference to the control of yaw plane dynamics of an air-to-air missile model. Specific attention is paid to compare two methods of global digital re-design of validated analogue closed loop control system. These two methods are the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) Plant Input Mapping (PIM) method and multi-loop PIM method. The thesis will first show how a specific class of closed loop MIMO feedback systems with a single-input multi-output (SIMO) plant can be re-structured as multi-loop control systems, which includes the closed loop missile control system. Some special characteristics pertaining to SIMO systems for control system design are explored. The aforementioned two methods of PIM global digital re-design are then applied to the MIMO analogue missile control system and its re-structured multi-loop counterpart. A comparison of the two methods is made on its design procedure, implementation structure and results from computer simulation.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comparative experimental study {{carried out on}} four types of smart panels for the reduction of sound radiation. The four panels are equipped with decentralized velocity feedback control units that are designed to generate active damping. In this way the frequency averaged response and sound radiation produced by stochastic disturbances can be effectively reduced at low audio frequencies. The first smart panel is composed of a 4 × 4 array of square piezoelectric patch actuators with accelerometer sensors at their centres. The second smart panel is composed of sixteen triangularly shaped piezoelectric patch actuators with base edges evenly distributed along the perimeter of the panel and accelerometer sensors located on the top vertices of the actuators. The third panel is composed of five electrodynamic inertial actuators with accelerometer sensors located under their footprints. The fourth panel is equipped with a light honeycomb trim panel mounted on four stiff mounts. A set of nine reactive electrodynamic actuators is located in the shallow cavity between the two panels.

40|$|A {{dynamic system}} {{response}} model for plasma in Mega-Amp Spherical Tokamak (MAST) {{has been developed}} using RZIP. This is a linearized tokamak model. It assumes a constant plasma current distribution and axisymmetry. The plasma and conducting structures are approximated by discrete toroidal current filaments. RZIP generates a state-space model of the system behaviour, with PF coil voltages as inputs and various predicted diagnostic measurements as outputs. A separate SIMULINK model has been developed to represent the MAST plant, power supplies and <b>analogue</b> <b>feedback</b> controller. The RZIP and SIMULINK models were combined to produce a complete system model. This combined model was used to simulate test shots under both vacuum and plasma conditions. The two sets of traces cohere reasonably well, with some difference in attenuation levels. System identification experiments were carried out on the PF coils, with particular attention paid to the vertical field coils, under vacuum conditions. The frequency response behaviour was found using an excitation signal comprising a number of sinusoids. The RZIP model was verified by comparing its predicted response with experimental data. © 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Instructed {{control of}} skin {{conductance}} {{and heart rate}} was compared using experimental groups trained to produce changes in {{one or the other}} of these responses. Subjects were required to produce increases and decreases in the vis-ceral target with the aid of visual <b>analogue</b> <b>feedback</b> for five training sessions. Differences arising between the groups were necessarily attributable to differences in the neural organization of the target responses, since the groups differed only with respect to the response that was identified by the feedback display. Instructed control of both targets was demonstrated. Subjects trained on the heart rate target produced both in~ creases and decreases in response level, whereas only con-trol in the increase direction was demonstrated by the skin conductance group. Instructed changes in skin conductance were approximately three times larger than those reported in previous studies of this response. Performance mechanisms underlying control also differed between the two groups. Increases in heart rate were as-sociated with increases in somatomotor and respiratory activ-ation, but control of skin conductance was manifested in varying physiological contexts.

40|$|Research {{in human}} operant heart rate {{conditioning}} {{concerned with the}} elucidation of the mediators of operant heart rate changes has postulated five mediating mechanisms related to operant heart rate change: respiratory, somatic-muscular, central neurological, cognitive and dispositional (personality). However, examination of the literature indicates that much of this research has produced equivocal results, hence, {{a clear picture of}} mediation has not emerged. Experimenters interested in the events that mediate operant heart rate changes have not devoted much attention to the individual variability that is so pervasive in studies of human psychophysiology. Individuals may fundamentally differ in teh autonomic, central neurological, cognitive and dispositional variables associated with bidirectional operant heart rate control. The present study assessed the validity of the hypothesized mediational mechanisms by examining individual response patterns during a multiple session, extended trials (8 minutes) operant heart rate conditioning paradigm. Specifically, physiological, cognitive and personality parameters were assessed in terms of their collective contribution to the variability in bidirectional heart rate performance. Fifty male subjects were instructed to control their heart and given visual feedback of cardiac activity during two training sessions separated by approximately one week. Each session consisted of two eight minute increase and decrease. The following dispositional-personality scales were administered: STAI-State and Trait Anxiety, Locus of Control, Introversion-Extroversion and Repression-Sensitization. Autonomic responding was assessed by continuously monitoring heart rate, respiration rate, forearm flexor electromyographic activity, eye blink and exosomatic galvanic skin response. In addition, subjects compelted a post-experimental questionnaire in order to provide several types of information concerning the cognitive strategies employed in the control of heart rate. A multivariate approach to data reduction and analysis resulted in the following findings: (a) subjects demonstrated substantial changes in bidirectional heart rate when given instructions and when provided with <b>analogue</b> beat-by-beat <b>feedback,</b> (b) the mechanisms which mediate operant changes represent a multidimensional idiosyncratic interaction between physiology, cognition and personality; different physiological, cognitive and personality variables are associated with bidirectional heart rate control for different subjects, and (c) differential acquisition rates in the ability to acquire successful heart rate control on increase and decrease training within a multiple session, extended trials operant conditioning paradigm. Collectively, these results indicate that bidirectional heart rate control is a complex idiosyncratic interaction between autonomic, cognitive and personality variables. Furthermore, these results have implications for operant heart rate control studies in that sources of variation, previously ignored in traditional between group comparison approaches have been identified as significant in their collective effect on control performance...|$|R

As part of the roll-out process, workshops were provided to close to 1, 000 speech pathology clinical educators and students {{were introduced to the}} new tool through their lectures and tutorials. In order to provide formative feedback {{in the early stages of}} the project (end 2006 – early 2007); a questionnaire (designed to elicit both quantitative and qualitative data) was used following the first 6 workshops (214 educators) and after the first lectures to students at 2 universities (145 students). Most educators (95 - 97 %) and students (74 - 85 %) reported understanding the main concepts that inform key components of COMPASSTM (behavioural descriptors, generic competencies, and use of the Visual <b>Analogue</b> Scale). Qualitative <b>feedback</b> indicated a need for further support in relation to understanding the need for direct observation and the use of the Visual Analogue Scale. Toward the completion of the project (end 2007 – early 2008), a similar questionnaire was distributed to clinical educators (33 respondents) and to students in 3 universities (76 respondents). Results continued to be positive for understanding of main concepts for educators (79 - 100 %) and for students (75 - 92 %). An important finding was the close similarity between educators and students in relation to their understandings about the tool, the areas in which they reported wanting more support/training, and the ways in which they would like to obtain further experience. The implications of these findings for the further embedding of the new assessment tool are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Adaptive optics is {{concerned}} with the correction of phase distortions in wavefronts which degrade the quality of images produced by optical systems. It was originally developed for both astronomy and the military, where the Earth's atmosphere causes distortions, although other uses are now being developed. As ground based telescopes become increasingly large the size and complexity of adaptive optics systems also increase, creating "extreme adaptive optics”. This thesis deals with such an adaptive optics system. A novel self referenced phase shifting interferometer based on a liquid crystal (LC) waveplate is presented which can measure high spatial frequency phase distortions. This is then coupled to a LC spatial light modulator wavefront corrector. The geometry is matched such that {{there is no need for}} a wavefront reconstructor. The performance is measured in two stages. Firstly, spatially where static phase distortions are measured by the interferometer and corrected. Secondly, temporally where a simple <b>analogue</b> <b>feedback</b> is implemented to show correction over a single corrector pixel for fast time varying phase distortions. This work builds on other published research on using point diffraction interferometry in adaptive optics. The novelty lies in the development of a new implementation of a point diffraction interferometer, and in the demonstration of a high-speed closed loop single channel system. This work therefore contributes to the groundwork required to build an extreme adaptive optics system whose complexity scales linearly with the size (area) of the telescope aperture.

40|$|Artificial linking of two {{isolated}} {{culture dishes}} {{is a fascinating}} means of investigating interactions among multiple groups of microbes or fungi. We examined artificial interaction between two isolated dishes containing Euglena cells, which are photophobic to strong blue light. The spatial distribution of swimming Euglena cells in two micro-aquariums in the dishes was evaluated {{as a set of}} new measures: the trace momentums (TMs). The blue light patterns next irradiated onto each dish were deduced from the set of TMs using digital or <b>analogue</b> <b>feedback</b> algorithms. In the digital feedback experiment, one of two different pattern-formation rules was imposed on each feedback system. The resultant cell distribution patterns satisfied the two rules with an and operation, showing that cooperative interaction was realized in the interlink feedback. In the analogue experiment, two dishes A and B were interlinked by a feedback algorithm that illuminated dish A (B) with blue light of intensity proportional to the cell distribution in dish B (A). In this case, a distribution pattern and its reverse were autonomously formed in the two dishes. The autonomous formation of a pair of reversal patterns reflects a type of habitat separation realized by competitive interaction through the interlink feedback. According to this study, interlink feedback between two or more separate culture dishes enables artificial interactions between isolated microbial groups, and autonomous cellular distribution patterns will be achieved by correlating various microbial species, despite environmental and spatial scale incompatibilities. The optical interlink feedback is also useful for enhancing the performance of Euglena-based soft biocomputing.

Eighty subjects were pretested for motor performance ability on a rotor-pursuit task and on magnitude of cardiac response to a novel stimulus. From the original group of eighty subjects, the thirty largest orienters and the thirty smallest orienters were chosen. From each group of thirty the ten subjects showing the best performance on the motor performance task and the ten subjects showing the poorest performance on this task were chosen to attempt to implement voluntary changes in heart rate. Heart rate, respiratory rate and two measures of chin electromyographic (EMG) activity were measured during five acceleration and five deceleration training trials. A no-feedback acceleration trial and a no-feedback deceleration trial preceded and followed the feedback trials. The order in which the trials were presented was randomized, and <b>analogue</b> <b>feedback</b> was provided by a meter. The results indicated that only one group of subjects (the High Performance-Low Orienting group) was able to produce significant increases in heart rate when feedback was provided. Subjects high in motor performance ability increased heart rate significantly without feedback after the training with feedback, whereas subjects low in motor performance ability could not increase their heart rates when no feedback was provided. Neither group was able to increase heart rate without feedback before the feedback trials were implemented. Subjects appeared able to decrease heart rate without feedback and with feedback. Decelerative ability was not affected by motor performance ability or orienting magnitude. Heart rate changes were often, but not always, accompanied by parallel changes in somatic-muscular activity. In general, the results suggested that the skills involved in increasing heart rate may be conceptually similar to those employed in performing a motor task. In addition, the ability to increase heart rate may be inhibited in individuals who exhibit large decelerative heart rate responses to novel stimuli. It also appeared that ability to decrease heart rate may not involve skills similar to those employed during a motor task. Decreases in heart rate were more often accompanied by parallel decreases in respiratory rate and EMG activity than were increases in heart rate, suggesting that cardiac-somatic coupling may be involved in attempting to decrease heart rate...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Feedback laws based upon optimal control theory were derived. and these resulted in a reduction of the structural loads on the wing of a simulated aircraft. Various models of the aircraft dynamics were used. the most complete being of order 79. This model included rigid body motion, structural flexibility effects, unsteady aerodynamics, gust dynamics and actuator dynamics. The structural effects were characterised by the first fifteen bending modes. The subject aircraft studied, was considered to employ active ailerons and elevators and was subjected to manoeuvre commands and simulated atmospheric turbulence. Extensive numerical tests have shown that feedback laws derived from reduced dimension models performed comparably with the feedback law based on the most complete model. Tests were made on feedback laws ranging from order 79 to order 5. It was. however. not possible {{to reduce the number}} of feedback variables below five as this then affected the stability of the aircraft. The law based upon five state variable feedback was given the designation 'safety law'. One of the consequences of operating under the action of the 'safety law' was that the same level of load reduction could not be achieved as was obtained whenever a full state feedback law was employed. In addition 'safety law' operation was often marked by large transient oscillations of the wing root bending moment and it was considered that this would subsequently affect the fatigue life of the structure. An observer design was then investigated which reconstructed the complete state vector from a selection of measurements of the sensor signals appropriate to the 'safety law'. Results have shown that it is possible to achieve a practical implementation of such a scheme which will possess all the attendant advantages of full state feedback control. A consequence of reducing the strength of the wing of the aircraft as a result of employing an active load alleviation scheme is that a considerable degree of reliability of the control system, higher than that of both the basic airframe and its propulsive system, will be required. Because the use of hardware redundancy techniques as a means of providing the required degree of reliability would be expensive, software redundancy techniques suggest an attractive alternative. One example of how software redundancy may be employed is demonstrated in respect of, checking the <b>analogue</b> <b>feedback</b> gain controller used in the aircraft to implement linear feedback. It is shown how a-microprocessor may be effectively employed to introduce a surrogate gain should one or more of the channels of the controller fail...|$|E
