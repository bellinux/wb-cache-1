5|$|Adam and Rachel (James Nesbitt and Helen Baxendale), and Karen and David (Hermione Norris and Robert Bathurst) {{arrive in}} Sydney, Australia for Pete and Jo's (John Thomson and Kimberley Joseph) hastily {{arranged}} wedding. Jo's father Rod Ellison (Gary Sweet) is {{surprised to learn}} that his daughter is getting married to a man he suspects is only after his money. After speaking to Rod, Adam tells Pete that he thinks the wedding is going <b>ahead</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> wrong reasons. Pete reacts angrily and tells Adam to forget being his best man. The following morning, Rod tries to bribe Pete to call off the wedding, but Pete declines. He later overhears Rod forbidding Jo to marry him and tells her they ought to postpone the wedding. Jo is devastated at his decision, and tells him to get out of her house. She confides her sorrow in her ex-fiancé Shawn (Sandy Winton), who unsuccessfully tries to restart their relationship by proposing to her.|$|E

Yorke was brought down by the Juve keeper in the area as he went round him, but the referee played the advantage and Cole tapped in from an acute angle. United held on for their first victory in Italy and booked their place in the Camp Nou for the final, against group opponents Bayern Munich.|$|E

25|$|Scotland {{long held}} an {{advantage}} in terms of wins, as they recorded ten wins in the first 16 matches. Scotland, the smaller country in terms of population, were superior during this period because passing football developed earlier there, {{as shown by the}} Scotch Professors who moved to play in the nascent English professional league during the late 1880s. Scotland were also dominant in the 1920s and 30s and prior to the Second World War had 29 wins in the series to England's 19. England reversed the dominance after the war, as Scotland have only won 12 matches since then. The Scots did win three games out of four from 1974 to 1977, but lost every other game in the 1970s, and have only won three times (compared to 13 English wins) since 1977. England pulled <b>ahead</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{first time in the history}} of the fixture with their win in 1983.|$|E

25|$|LeRon Ellis made local {{headlines}} at {{the start}} of his sophomore year when he became the first African American inducted into the University of Kentucky's Kappa Alpha fraternity. Ellis was also the center of attention on the court as many of Kentucky's high-profile basketball players were unable to play in the 1988-89 season. Offensive and defensive stars Ed Davender, Robert Lock and Winston Bennett graduated from school; the Wildcats' MVP Rex Chapman left school early to enter the 1988 NBA Draft; sophomore standout Eric Manuel was suspended for the entire season from playing basketball and potential franchise recruit Shawn Kemp was transferred out of the university {{before the start of the}} season. Kentucky's basketball program was essentially put into the hands of the unexperienced sophomore LeRon Ellis and freshman Chris Mills.

Down to their last strike, Chris Taylor drove in Barnes to tie the game with a single.|$|E
25|$|On 2 September the Saints hosted last season's runners-up Manchester United {{in their}} third {{game on the}} season. Rickie Lambert opened the scoring for the home side with his second goal {{of the season in}} the 16th minute, heading in a Jason Puncheon cross. The lead was {{cancelled}} out just seven minutes later however, as new United signing Robin van Persie equalised. The first half ended level, and it took until the 55th minute for the deadlock to be broken, with Morgan Schneiderlin putting Southampton <b>ahead</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> second time in the match. 15 minutes later the visitors were awarded a penalty due to a foul by Jos Hooiveld on Van Persie, although it was saved by Kelvin Davis to keep Saints ahead. In the 87th minute however, Van Persie scored his second of the match to equalise for the second time, and he completed a hat-trick in stoppage time to secure United's win and subject the Saints to their third loss in three games, leaving them bottom of the table as the only club yet to have picked up a point.|$|E

25|$|Kershaw and Keuchel started Game 5, in {{a rematch}} {{of the opening}} game of the series. Forsythe singled in two runs off of Keuchel {{in the first inning}} to put the Dodgers up early. A third run scored on a {{throwing}} error by Gurriel. Barnes singled in the fourth to score Forsythe. Keuchel pitched only 3 innings for the Astros, allowing five hits and four runs (three earned). This was his shortest home start of the season. The Astros scored their first run with an RBI double by Correa {{in the bottom of the}} fourth inning, followed by a three-run home run by Gurriel to tie the game. Bellinger hit a three-run home run off of Collin McHugh in the top of the fifth to put the Dodgers back on top only for Altuve to hit his own three-run home run in the bottom of the inning off Maeda to tie it back up. Kershaw only pitched 4 innings and allowed six runs on four hits and three walks. A triple by Bellinger on a line drive that Springer missed on a dive in the seventh inning off of Peacock scored Hernández from first base. In the bottom of the seventh inning, Springer hit a home run off the first pitch in the bottom of the inning off of Morrow, who was pitching for the third consecutive day, to tie the game.

That was the 21st home run of the series, tying the record set in the 2002 World Series. Puig broke the record with a two-run home run in the top of the ninth inning. Taylor drove in Barnes to tie the game. With the teams combining to score 24 runs through the first nine innings, this was the highest scoring World Series game since the Florida Marlins beat the Cleveland Indians 14–11 in Game 3 of the 1997 World Series. Bregman singled in pinch runner Derek Fisher for the winning run in the tenth off of Jansen. The Astros became only the second team to come back twice from three runs down in a World Series game. The other were the Toronto Blue Jays in the 15–14 win during Game 4 of the 1993 World Series. This World Series set a new record for most players to hit a home run (14 to date in the World Series).. The 2017 World Series also set a record for the number of players who hit at least one home run Game 5 lasted five hours and seventeen minutes, making it the second longest World Series game in history, trailing only the 14 inning contest between the Astros and the Chicago White Sox in Game 3 of the 2005 World Series and the six game tying home runs in the series to this point is the most for any World Series on record.|$|E

At the same time, the US 8th Cavalry Regiment had taken up positions around the town, with its 1st Battalion defending the north of Unsan by the Samtan River, while its 2nd and 3rd Battalions defending the areas west of the Unsan by the Nammyon River.

500|$|After the {{successful}} {{attack against the}} Eighth Army's right flank, the PVA High Command gave the go <b>ahead</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 39th Corps to attack the US 25th Infantry Division on November 26. The PVA 115th Division of the 39th Corps was immediately mobilized for an assault against Task Force Wilson and the US 24th Infantry Regiment, while the 116th and 117th Division were moving to attack Ipsok and to cut the American retreat route. The crushing attack soon left the task force decimated and reeling. The PVA 347th Regiment of the 115th Division first met the C Company on the task force's center, and after the sharp encounter most of the C Company's men were [...] missing in action. On the right flank, the 115th Division attacked the task force's B Company. Met with waves of Chinese suicide bombers, the B Company was reduced to 26 soldiers out of the original 200. Some Chinese snipers and infiltrators even managed to reach Task Force Wilson's command post, resulting {{in the death of}} the task force's executive officer. As the entire task force's line collapsing, the E Company sleeping at the task force's rear was pushed to the front line. Although the tank fire from the E Company stopped the Chinese advance, the company was reduced to just one platoon after the battle. Chinese forces in the rear had also attacked the task force's artillery at Ipsok, preventing fire support during the night. In the aftermath of the night battle, the task force found itself surrounded, and the Chinese troops were chanting in all directions against the Americans. When Wilson tried to evacuate the wounded, Chinese roadblocks ambushed the medical convoy just south of the 2nd Battalion's perimeter.|$|E
500|$|Owing to the {{suppression}} by Serbia of Apis's confession {{and of the}} Salonika trial transcripts historians did not initially link Malobabić closely to the Sarajevo attack. [...] Apis's confession, however, states that [...] "I engaged Malobabić to organize the assassination {{on the occasion of}} the announced arrival of Franz Ferdinand to Sarajevo." [...] At the Salonika trial, Colonel Ljubomir Vulović (head of the Serbian Frontiers Service) testified: [...] 'In 1914 on occasion of my official trip from Loznica to Belgrade, I received a letter at the General Staff [...] noting that agents of Malobabić would come and a teacher whose name I don't recall (Danilo Ilić was a teacher but it is unclear if the teacher in question was Ilić as Ilić can be placed in Brod but not Loznica) so I could sent [...] them into Bosnia.' Because of that 'I went to Loznica and either that day or very soon afterwards sent Rade and that teacher into Bosnia.' [...] Soon thereafter occurred the Sarajevo assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand." [...] On the eve of his execution, Malobabić told a priest: [...] "They ordered me to go to Sarajevo when that assassination was to take place, and when everything was over, they ordered me to come back and fulfill other missions, and then there was the outbreak of the war." [...] Vladimir Dedijer in The Road to Sarajevo presented additional testimonial evidence that Malobabić arrived in Sarajevo on the eve of the Sarajevo attack and gave the final go <b>ahead</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> operation to Danilo Ilić. This meshes with Dedijer's theory that Djuro Ŝarac had given instructions to Ilić on 16 June cancelling the assassination. [...] Soon after their confessions, Serbia executed Malobabić, Vulović, and Apis on false charges. Serbia published no clarifications of their confessions with regards to the Sarajevo attack.|$|E
