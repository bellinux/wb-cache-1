5|$|Clindamycin is used {{primarily}} to treat anaerobic infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria, including dental infections, and infections of the respiratory tract, skin, and soft tissue, and peritonitis. In people with hypersensitivity to penicillins, clindamycin {{may be used}} to treat infections caused by susceptible <b>aerobic</b> <b>bacteria,</b> as well. It is also used to treat bone and joint infections, particularly those caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Topical application of clindamycin phosphate can be used to treat mild to moderate acne.|$|E

25|$|A {{standardized}} {{management plane}} of febrile, neutropenic patients must be devised in each institution or agency. Empirical regimens must contain antibiotics broadly active against Gram-negative <b>aerobic</b> <b>bacteria</b> (quinolones: i.e., ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin with pseudomonal coverage: e.g., cefepime, ceftazidime, or an aminoglycoside: i.e. gentamicin, amikacin).|$|E
25|$|Metronidazole {{is of the}} {{nitroimidazole}} class. It inhibits {{nucleic acid}} synthesis by disrupting the DNA of microbial cells. This function only occurs when metronidazole is partially reduced, and because this reduction usually happens only in anaerobic cells, it has relatively little effect upon human cells or <b>aerobic</b> <b>bacteria.</b>|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} lines of {{evidence}} that support endosymbiosis theory. Mitochondria and chloroplasts contain their own small supply of DNA, which may be remnants of the genome the organelles had when they were independent <b>aerobic</b> <b>bacteria.</b> The single most convincing evidence of the descent of organelles from bacteria is the position of mitochondria and plastid DNA sequences in phylogenetic trees of bacteria. Mitochondria have sequences that clearly indicate origin {{from a group of}} bacteria called the alphaproteobacteria. Plastids have DNA sequences that indicate origin from the cyanobacteria (blue-green algae). In addition, there are organisms alive today, called living intermediates, that are in a similar endosymbiotic condition to the prokaryotic cells and the <b>aerobic</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Living intermediates show that the evolution proposed by the endosymbiont theory is possible. For example, the giant amoeba Pelomyxa lacks mitochondria but has <b>aerobic</b> <b>bacteria</b> that carry out a similar role. A variety of corals, clams, snails, and one species of Paramecium permanently host algae in their cells. Many of the insect endosymbionts have been shown to have ancient associations with their hosts, involving strictly vertical inheritance. In addition, these insect symbionts have similar patterns of genome evolution to those found in true organelles: genome reduction, rapid rates of gene evolution, and bias in nucleotide base composition favoring adenine and thymine, at the expense of guanine and cytosine.|$|E
25|$|These modern organisms with endosymbiotic {{relationships}} with <b>aerobic</b> <b>bacteria</b> have verified the endosymbiotic theory, which explains {{the origin of}} mitochondria and chloroplasts from bacteria. Researchers in molecular and evolutionary biology no longer question this theory, {{although some of the}} details, such as the mechanisms for loss of genes from organelles to host nuclear genomes, are still being worked out.|$|E
25|$|If the wet/dry filter {{is placed}} {{on top of the}} aquarium, water is pumped over a number of {{perforated}} trays containing filter wool or some other filter material. The water trickles through the trays, keeping the filter wool wet but not completely submerged, allowing <b>aerobic</b> <b>bacteria</b> to grow and aiding biological filtration. The water returns to the aquarium like rain.|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} kinds of oil-consuming {{bacteria}}. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and acid-producing bacteria are anaerobic, while general <b>aerobic</b> <b>bacteria</b> (GAB) are aerobic. These bacteria occur naturally and will act to remove oil from an ecosystem, and their biomass will tend to replace other populations in the food chain. The chemicals from the oil which dissolve in water, and hence are available to bacteria, are those in the water associated fraction of the oil.|$|E
25|$|The <b>aerobic</b> <b>bacteria</b> {{found in}} poultry housing can {{include not only}} E. coli, but Staphylococcus, Pseudomona, Micrococcus and others as well. These {{contaminants}} can contribute to dust that often cause issues with the respiratory systems of both the poultry and humans working in the environment. If bacterial levels in the poultry drinking water reach high levels, it can result in bacterial diarrhoea {{which can lead to}} blood poisoning should the bacteria spread from the damaged intestines.|$|E
25|$|Oxygen gas or {{ambient air}} {{can also be}} {{injected}} to promote growth of <b>aerobic</b> <b>bacteria</b> which accelerate natural attenuation of organic contaminants. One disadvantage {{of this approach is}} the possibility of decreasing anaerobic contaminant destruction natural attenuation where existing conditions enhance anaerobic bacteria which normally live in the soil prefer a reducing environment. In general though, aerobic activity is much faster than anaerobic and overall destruction rates are typically greater when aerobic activity can be successfully promoted.|$|E

25|$|Treatment {{can include}} topical steroids to {{diminish}} the inflammation. Antibiotics {{to diminish the}} proportion of <b>aerobic</b> <b>bacteria</b> is still a matter of debate. The use of local antibiotics, preferably local non-absorbed and broad spectrum, covering enteric gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes, can be an option. In some cases, systemic antibiotics can be helpful, such as amoxicillin/clavulanate or moxifloxacin. Vaginal rinsing with povidone iodine can provide relief of symptoms but does not provide long-term reduction of bacterial loads. Dequalinium chloride can also be an option for treatment.|$|E
25|$|Formamide {{produces}} {{all four}} ribonucleotides and other biological molecules when warmed {{in the presence}} of various terrestrial minerals. Formamide is ubiquitous in the Universe, produced by the reaction of water and hydrogen cyanide (HCN). It has several advantages as a biotic precursor, including the ability to easily become concentrated through the evaporation of water. Although HCN is poisonous, it only affects aerobic organisms (eukaryotes and <b>aerobic</b> <b>bacteria),</b> which did not yet exist. It can play roles in other chemical processes as well, such as the synthesis of the amino acid glycine.|$|E
500|$|The {{first model}} {{known as the}} [...] "syntrophic model" [...] proposes that a {{symbiotic}} relationship between the archaea and bacteria created the nucleus-containing eukaryotic cell. (Organisms of the Archaea and Bacteria domain have no cell nucleus.) It is hypothesized that the symbiosis originated when ancient archaea, similar to modern methanogenic archaea, invaded and lived within bacteria similar to modern myxobacteria, eventually forming the early nucleus. This theory {{is analogous to the}} accepted theory for the origin of eukaryotic mitochondria and chloroplasts, which are thought to have developed from a similar endosymbiotic relationship between proto-eukaryotes and <b>aerobic</b> <b>bacteria.</b> The archaeal origin of the nucleus is supported by observations that archaea and eukarya have similar genes for certain proteins, including histones. Observations that myxobacteria are motile, can form multicellular complexes, and possess kinases and G proteins similar to eukarya, support a bacterial origin for the eukaryotic cell.|$|E

500|$|A {{survey in}} 2005 {{discovered}} that 11 {{of the known}} wooden Bronze Age causeways on the Levels had been destroyed or vanished and others were seriously damaged, caused by the reduction in water levels and subsequent exposure of the timber to oxygen and <b>aerobic</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Part of the Sweet Track is being actively conserved. Following purchase of land by the National Heritage Memorial Fund, and installation of a water pumping and distribution system along a [...] section, several hundred metres of the track's length are now being actively conserved. This method of preserving wetland archaeological remains (i.e. maintaining a high water table and saturating the site) is rare. A [...] section, which lies within the land owned by the Nature Conservancy Council, has been surrounded by a clay bank to prevent drainage into surrounding lower peat fields, and water levels are regularly monitored. The viability of this method is demonstrated by comparing it with the nearby Abbot's Way, which has not had similar treatment, and which in 1996 {{was found to have}} become dewatered and desiccated. Evaluation and maintenance of water levels in the Shapwick Heath Nature Reserve involves the Nature Conservancy Council, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Somerset Levels Project.|$|E
