5|$|The <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>plan</b> and strategize, {{much like}} {{abstract}} thinking, {{can be seen}} in the more diversified toolkit of the Middle Stone Age, as well as in the subsistence patterns of the period. As MSA hominins began to migrate into a range of different ecological zones, it became necessary to base hunting strategies around seasonally available resources. Awareness of seasonality is evident in the faunal remains found at temporary sites. In less forgiving ecological zones, this awareness would have been essential for survival and the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>plan</b> subsistence strategies based on this awareness demonstrates an ability to think beyond the present tense and act upon this knowledge.|$|E
5|$|The British {{authorities}} in the area refused to support the raid, which they considered a breach of Spanish neutrality. Permission for the operation to go ahead eventually came from the Foreign Office in London. On 14 January 1942, while the ships' officers were attending a party arranged by an SOE agent, the commandos entered the port aboard two tugs, overpowered the ships' crews and sailed off with the ships, including the Italian merchant vessel Duchessa d'Aosta. The raid boosted SOE's reputation at a critical time and demonstrated its <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>plan</b> and conduct secret operations no matter the political consequences.|$|E

25|$|Adolescents' {{thinking}} is less bound to concrete events {{than that of}} children: they can contemplate possibilities {{outside the realm of}} what currently exists. One manifestation of the adolescent's increased facility with thinking about possibilities is the improvement of skill in deductive reasoning, which leads to the development of hypothetical thinking. This provides the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>plan</b> ahead, see the future consequences of an action and to provide alternative explanations of events. It also makes adolescents more skilled debaters, as they can reason against a friend's or parent's assumptions. Adolescents also develop a more sophisticated understanding of probability.|$|E
25|$|The core {{objective}} in {{training to be}} a solo diver is to become as self-sufficient and self-reliant as possible, {{to be able to}} deal with any reasonably foreseeable problems without assistance, and to have the competence, fitness, discipline, skills and equipment that will achieve this result. This requires competence at risk-assessment and the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>plan</b> dives and select equipment that limit the risks. An additional benefit of these disciplines is that they will improve the safety of buddy diving whenever the competent solo diver pairs up with another diver in a buddy team by reducing the risk of the second diver being exposed to an emergency which they may not be capable of managing. Agencies training solo divers also recommend the self-sufficiency training in their courses for all divers as their diving experience grows, so as to achieve greater safety in all diving—buddy and solo.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{remains of}} Homo sapiens {{date back to}} approximately 195 thousand years ago in eastern Africa. In the archaeological record of both eastern Africa and southern Africa, there is immense variability associated with Homo sapiens sites, and it is during this time that we see evidence {{of the origins of}} modern human behavior. According to McBrearty and Brooks, there are four features that are characteristic of modern human behavior: abstract thinking, the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>plan</b> and strategize, [...] "behavioral, economic and technological innovativeness," [...] and symbolic behavior. Many of these aspects of modern human behavior can be broken down into more specific categories, including art, personal adornment, technological advancement, yet these four overarching categories allow for a thorough, albeit significantly overlapping, discussion of behavioral modernity.|$|E
500|$|In July 1940, McNair {{began his}} new {{assignment}} {{as chief of}} staff for General Headquarters, United States Army (GHQ), the organization the Army created to oversee World War II mobilization, organization, equipping, and training. Marshall was appointed to command GHQ in addition to his duties as Chief of Staff of the Army; in order to concentrate on his primary role, he largely delegated responsibility for running GHQ to McNair. [...] As part of this working relationship, Marshall provided McNair broad advice and guidance, and McNair obtained approval from Marshall for the most important decisions. [...] As GHQ's responsibilities increased following U.S. entry into the war, McNair's responsibilities were encroached upon by members of the War Department staff; for instance, the logistics staff section (G-4) retained authority over corps area commands in matters involving billeting, equipping, and supplying soldiers undergoing mobilization training, which limited GHQ's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>plan</b> them and oversee their execution.|$|E

We demonstrate the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> generate <b>plans</b> using a quasistatic physics model for the forward model rollouts.

Their pioneering use of water-proof hydraulic mortar and particularly Roman concrete allowed for much larger dam structures than previously built, such as the Lake Homs Dam, possibly the largest water barrier to that date, and the Harbaqa Dam, both in Roman Syria. The highest Roman dam was the Subiaco Dam near Rome; its record height of [...] remained unsurpassed until its accidental destruction in 1305.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} World War II, Florida was experiencing unprecedented growth in population and tourism, along with a revitalized citrus industry recovering from a harsh freeze early in the decade; the increased traffic load quickly burdened the state's highway system.
