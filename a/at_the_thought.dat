5|$|Rosebery's {{own mother}} was horrified <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> of a Jewish woman, even a Rothschild, in the family. Rosebery too {{felt there was}} an impassable barrier of faith; at this time, it was inconceivable that any {{children}} could be reared as Jews. Although it has been stated that Rosebery himself was devoid of any antisemitic views, this was not always true, especially in later life.|$|E
5|$|In {{the nearby}} kingdom of Ban, Abdul Moelan meets and {{falls in love}} with Siti Akbari, {{daughter}} of the Sultan of Ban. The two soon marry and, after six months in Ban, return to Barbari. Siti Bida Undara, at first upset <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> of sharing her husband, soon becomes close friends with Siti Akbari. Shortly thereafter Bahar Oedin takes his revenge, capturing Abdul Moelan and Siti Bida Undara. When the sultan tries to capture Siti Akbari, he discovers a body in her room and believes it to be hers. He takes his captives back to Hindustan and imprisons them.|$|E
5|$|A chorus greets {{the dawn}} as Ariadne, after a troubled night's sleep, {{returns to the}} shore with her companion, Dorilla, to find that Theseus has departed. Dorilla offers her comfort. In despair <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> that Theseus will not return, Ariadne {{nevertheless}} decides {{to go to the}} landing area to wait for him. In a pastoral interlude a chorus sings of the joys of rural life, and expresses the hope that Theseus will not forget Ariadne. Primed by an envoy with the news that Ariadne is alone and sorrowing, the chorus again sings in sympathy with her. On the beach, Ariadne sings her lament for her lost love and prepares to kill herself. At this point fanfares are heard heralding an arrival, causing Ariadne to hope that it is Theseus returning. In another interlude the chorus empathises, but a second envoy announces that it is Bacchus who has arrived, having taken pity on Ariadne. A sung ballo celebrates the anticipated betrothal of Bacchus and Ariadne. In the final scene Cupid reappears, and Venus rises from the sea before Jupiter speaks his blessing from the heavens. The union is sealed as Bacchus promises Ariadne immortality in heaven, and a crown of stars.|$|E

5|$|As {{the family}} eats breakfast the next morning, Lois reveals her {{intention}} {{to become a}} surrogate mother for Naomi and Dale, causing Peter to become upset <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> of her being pregnant for nine months. Despite this, Lois decides to go to Dr. Hartman to have the in vitro fertilization performed, enduring more of Dr. Hartman's shtick involving celebrity crossbreeds and having a tribe of bush men implant the egg with blowguns. A pregnancy test comes back positive the next day, and a furious Peter attempts to cause Lois to have a miscarriage before ultimately confronting her about the pregnancy. While she continues asserting her intention to provide a child to Naomi and Dale, Quahog 5 News suddenly reveals that Naomi and Dale {{died in a car}} crash on Interstate 95. Devastated by the announcement, Lois questions whether she should have an abortion or continue with the pregnancy and put the baby up for adoption.|$|E
5|$|George visited Russia {{again in}} 1867 {{to meet with}} his sister Dagmar, who had married Tsarevitch Alexander (later Alexander III) the year before. He was {{determined}} to find a wife {{and the idea of}} an alliance with a Russian grand duchess, born into the Eastern Orthodox Church, appealed to him. Olga fell in love with George, but she was nevertheless anxious and distraught <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> of leaving Russia. Her father was initially reluctant to agree to their marriage, thinking that at the age of fifteen she was too young and, being close to his daughter, concerned by the distance between Greece and Russia. For her part, Grand Duchess Alexandra was much more enthusiastic than her husband and, when some members of the imperial family noted the extreme youth of her daughter, she replied that Olga would not always be as young. Eventually, it was decided that Olga and George would marry when she had reached her sixteenth birthday. Meanwhile, she would continue her schoolwork until her wedding day.|$|E
5|$|Rachel, who is {{spending}} {{most of her time}} in her hotel room on account of her pregnancy, receives a visit from her expatriated lesbian sister Lucy (Susannah Doyle). Lucy tells Rachel that she has been sleeping around with men {{in order to have a}} child. When Adam learns of this, he suggests to Lucy that she use some of his banked sperm. They broach the idea to Rachel, who is disgusted <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> of her husband having a baby with her sister and forbids it from going ahead. Meanwhile, Karen finally assures David that the animosity between them caused by his extramarital affair is in the past. She emails Mark Cubitt (Sean Pertwee), a man she has been having an affair with in England, to tell him their fling is over. Mark arrives at her apartment the next morning and spends the day with her after David cancels a visit to an art gallery with her. He convinces her that David is still the same insensitive man that he has always been. The next day, Karen tells Rachel that she will leave David to be with Mark.|$|E

5|$|The Queen, {{increasingly}} disdainful of the Marlboroughs and her ministry, {{finally took}} the opportunity to dismiss Sunderland in June 1710. Godolphin followed in August. The Junto Whigs were removed from office, although Marlborough, for the moment, remained as commander of the army. In their place, she appointed a new ministry, headed by Harley, which began to seek peace with France. Unlike the Whigs, Harley and his ministry were ready to compromise by giving Spain to the Bourbon claimant, Philip of Anjou, in return for commercial concessions. In the parliamentary elections that soon followed his appointment, Harley, aided by government patronage, secured a large Tory majority. In January 1711, Anne forced Sarah to resign her court offices, and Abigail took over as Keeper of the Privy Purse. Harley was stabbed by a disgruntled French refugee, the Marquis de Guiscard, in March, and Anne wept <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> he would die. He recovered slowly. Godolphin's death from natural causes in September 1712 reduced Anne to tears; she blamed their estrangement on the Marlboroughs.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{continued}} to prosper through the 1920s and 1930s with a toll of one quarter {{to cross the}} bridge, with drivers of State Highway Route 6 coming along the bridge from the junction with State Highway Route 8 coming across the bridge since 1927. During the 1920s and 1930s, the states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania began to buy out bridges along the Delaware River under the Joint Commission for the Elimination of Toll Bridges. The reconstructed bridge at Belvidere was bought by the commission for $60,000 (1920s USD) and the covered bridge at Columbia for only $50,000. Although the commission tried to buy the second-hand railroad bridge for a lower, unspecified amount, Darlington used his strong bargaining skills to raise the amount to $275,000, {{a far cry from}} the other local bridges. Residents of Knowlton Township, New Jersey rejoiced at the fact of when the bridge was bought, tolls were eliminated from the crossing. The new generation of people prospered <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> that the crossing the Delaware would be forever free.|$|E
5|$|The {{party is}} warped {{back to the}} top of Holy Loly Mountain, where the party discovers George's grave. Large rocks block the {{entrance}} to a cave inside Holy Loly Mountain, but are cleared by the power of Maria's conscience. The party encounters the Mother Ship and a fluid-filled tank that contains Giygas. The alien expresses its gratefulness to Ninten's family for raising it, but explains that George stole vital information from its people that could have been used to betray them, and proceeds to accuse Ninten of interfering with their plans. Giygas offers to save Ninten alone if he boards the Mother Ship. When Ninten declines, Giygas attempts to put Ninten to sleep. The party begins to sing the Eight Melodies while Giygas tries to quiet the party through an attack. When the party finishes the lullaby, Giygas is overcome with emotion <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> of Maria's motherly love. Giygas says they will meet again and flies off in the Mother Ship. The game ends with Ninten, Ana, and Lloyd facing the player as the credits roll behind them.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Pasternak {{wrote to}} Renate Schweitzer and his sister, Lydia Pasternak Slater. In both letters, the author {{expressed}} {{hope that he}} would be passed over by the Nobel Committee in favour of Alberto Moravia.

25|$|With this {{commission}} Manon, the third trophy, {{slipped out of}} the room, as untouched as she had come; her errand didn't seem to trouble her. I was greatly relieved <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> that nothing could touch her, that she would always remain as she was and never become like her mother, the poisoner on the wall, the glassy, blubbery old woman on the sofa.|$|E

60|$|Answer. O, but mercy abused becomes most fearful in tormenting. Did {{you never}} {{read that the}} Lamb turned lion, and that the world will tremble <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wrath of the Lamb, and be afflicted more <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> of that, than <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> of {{anything}} that shall happen {{to them in the}} day when God shall call them to an account for their sins? (Rev 6:16,17). The time of mercy will be then past, for now is that acceptable time, behold now is the day of salvation; the gate of mercy will then be shut, and must not be opened again; for now is that gate open, now it is open for a door of hope (2 Cor 6:2; Matt 25:10; Luke 13:25).|$|R
60|$|Shortly after this, Beechnut and the {{children}} all went into the house, and Stuyvesant and Phonny went to bed. Stuyvesant was so much excited, however, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> of his journey, {{that it was a}} long time before he could get to sleep.|$|R
25|$|Kitri, an inn-keeper's daughter, steals out of {{her house}} to meet her beloved, the barber Basilio. Her father, Lorenzo, sees the lovers and sends Basilio away, {{bringing}} Kitri to tears. Now comes the rich nobleman Gamache, who, likewise in love with Kitri, goes to Lorenzo and asks for his daughter's hand. The innkeeper accepts with delight but Kitri, appalled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> of wedding the foppish nobleman, runs away.|$|E
25|$|The sweeter cola {{overwhelmingly}} beat both regular Coke and Pepsi in taste tests, surveys, {{and focus}} groups. Asked {{if they would}} buy and drink the product if it were Coca-Cola, most testers said they would, although it would take some getting used to. About 10-12% of testers felt angry and alienated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought,</b> and said they might stop drinking Coke altogether. Their presence in focus groups tended to negatively skew results as they exerted indirect peer pressure on other participants.|$|E
25|$|The Catholic Church {{sees the}} effects of the sacrament as follows. As the sacrament of Marriage gives grace for the married state, the sacrament of Anointing of the Sick gives grace for the state into which people enter through sickness. Through the sacrament a gift of the Holy Spirit is given, that renews {{confidence}} and faith in God and strengthens against temptations to discouragement, despair and anguish <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> of death and the struggle of death; it prevents from losing Christian hope in God's justice, truth and salvation.|$|E

25|$|The Duke of Buckingham then {{negotiated}} with the French regent, Cardinal Richelieu, for English ships to aid Richelieu in his fight against the French Huguenots, in exchange for French aid against the Spanish occupying the Electorate of the Palatinate, but the Parliament of England was disgusted and horrified <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> of English Protestants fighting French Protestants. The plan only fuelled their fears of crypto-Catholicism at court. Buckingham himself, believing that the failure of his enterprise {{was the result of}} treachery by Richelieu, formulated an alliance among Cardinal Richelieu's many enemies, a policy that included support for the very Huguenots whom he had recently attacked.|$|E
25|$|Land {{values in}} Indiana {{collapsed}} {{during the early}} 1920s and severely hurt McCray's financial position because of his large involvement in land speculation. Although he owned nearly $3 million in assets, he was faced with bankruptcy, but was disturbed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> of losing his beloved farm. He took a loan from the State Agricultural Board for $155,000 and deposited into his personal account to cover his debts. He then began soliciting loans from banks by creating fake promissory notes and using them as collateral. Bank officials later claimed they were coerced by the governor who hinted that he would remove state deposits if they didn't grant him the loans.|$|E
25|$|Virgil's {{contemporary}} Horace wrote {{often of}} wine, though no single work is devoted {{entirely to the}} subject. He espoused an Epicurean view of taking life's pleasures, including wine, in moderation. Among the earliest recorded examples of deliberately choosing a wine for a specific occasion, Horace's Odes included serving a wine from the birth-year vintage at a celebration of an honored guest. He writes of serving simple wines for everyday occasions and saving celebrated wines such as Caecuban for special events. Horace answered the question posed by the Alexandrian poet Callimachus as to whether water or wine was the preferred drink of poetic inspiration by enthusiastically siding with Cratinus and the wine drinkers. His affinity for wine was such that while contemplating his death, he expressed more dread <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> of departing from his beloved wine cellar than his wife.|$|E
