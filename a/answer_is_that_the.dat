Firstly, it maintains the distribution of the classes of the labeled training data. Secondly, this form of meta-learning can be applied to a wide range of common learning algorithms. Thirdly, this approach can be easily implemented with the help of state-of-the-art machine learning software. 1...|$|R

John McCarthy, on the other hand, still blamed the qualification problem. For Ray Kurzweil, the issue is computer power and, using Moore's Law, he predicted that machines with human-level intelligence will appear by 2029. Jeff Hawkins argued that neural net research ignores the essential properties of the human cortex, preferring simple models that have been successful at solving simple problems.

Baugh asserted this as evidence against scientifically known ways that rocks form. However, laboratory tests discounted his claim about the hammer's being formed in the rock. J.R.

[...] This question {{is followed by a}} mock answer: [...] "The mock <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> young man should be prouder of having taught a hitherto dumb admirer to sing, and of having advanced ignorance as high as learning, because these achievements on his part testify more impressively to his originally power than his (slighter) accomplishments with respect to his learned poets — he but mends their style and graces their arts." [...] The debate that Shakespeare presents is [...] "in a Petrarchan logical structure, with a clearly demarcated octave and sestet." [...] Shakespeare has to exhibit his present art as at least equal to that of his rivals. He accomplishes this [...] "by first resorting to a country-bumpkin, fairy-tale idiot-son role, presenting himself as a Cinderella, so to speak, raised from the cinders to the skies."

2500|$|In 2005, the {{chiropractic}} subluxation {{was defined}} by the World Health Organization as [...] "a lesion or dysfunction in a joint or motion segment in which alignment, movement integrity and/or physiological function are altered, although contact between joint surfaces remains intact.

[...] This differs from the medical definition of subluxation as a significant structural displacement, which can be seen with static imaging techniques such as X-rays. This exposes patients to harmful ionizing radiation for no evidentially supported reason. The 2008 book Trick or Treatment states [...] "X-rays can reveal neither the subluxations nor the innate intelligence associated with chiropractic philosophy, {{because they do not}} exist." [...] Attorney David Chapman-Smith, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Chiropractic, has stated that [...] "Medical critics have asked how there can be a subluxation if it cannot be seen on X-ray.

60|$|It is not {{possible}} to reverse this judgment or to take away a single count from it. Is there, then, anything whatever to be said for the English in the matter? There is: though the English never by any chance say it. Nor do the Irish say it; though it is in a sense a weakness as well as a defence. One would think the Irish had reason to say anything that can be said against the English ruling class, but they have not said, indeed they have hardly discovered, one quite simple fact--that it rules England. They are right in asking that the Irish should have a say in the Irish government, but they are quite wrong in supposing that the English have any particular say in English government. And I seriously believe I am not deceived by any national bias, when I say that the common Englishman would be quite incapable of the cruelties that were committed in his name. But, most important of all, it is the historical fact that there was another England, an England consisting of common Englishmen, which not only certainly would have done better, but actually did make some considerable attempt to do better. If anyone asks for the evidence, the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> evidence has been destroyed, or at least deliberately boycotted: but {{can be found in the}} unfashionable corners of literature; and, when found, is final. If anyone asks for the great men of such a potential democratic England, the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> great men are labelled small men, or not labelled at all; have been successfully belittled as the emancipation of which they dreamed has dwindled. The greatest of them is now little more than a name; he is criticised to be underrated and not to be understood; but he presented all that alternative and more liberal Englishry; and was enormously popular because he presented it. In taking him as the type of it we may tell most shortly the whole of this forgotten tale. And, even when I begin to tell it, I find myself in the presence of that ubiquitous evil which is the subject of this book. It is a fact, and I think it is not a coincidence, that in standing for a moment where this Englishman stood, I again find myself confronted by the German soldier.|$|E
