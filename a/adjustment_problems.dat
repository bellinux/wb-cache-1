[...] To avoid the sampling bias that, they argued, existed in most studies of CSA (which drew from samples mostly in the mental health or legal systems and thus were, as a sample, unlike the population as a whole), the 1997 study combined data from studies using only national samples of individuals expected to be more representative of the population {{of child sexual abuse}} victims. This study examined 10 independent samples designed to be nationally representative, based on data from more than 8,500 participants. Four of the studies came from the United States, and one each came from Great Britain, Canada, and Spain.|$|E

2500|$|Gray's {{reinforcement}} sensitivity theory (RST) {{consists of}} two motivational systems: the behaviour inhibition system (BIS) and the behaviour activation system (BAS). [...] The BIS is responsible for organizing behaviour in response to adverse stimuli. In other words, stimuli associated with punishment or the omission/termination of reward, are believed to underlie anxiety. The purpose of the BIS is to initiate behaviour inhibition, or interrupt ongoing behaviour, [...] while the BAS is sensitive to stimuli that signal reward and/or relief from punishment (impusivity). In accordance with the RST, an association was found between people with extreme scores in BIS/BAS and <b>adjustment</b> <b>problems.</b> BIS and BAS reactivity correspond with individual trait differences in positive affect and negative affect – The BAS is associated with trait impulsivity and positive affect, while the BIS is associated with trait negative affect. For instance, it has been postulated that high BIS is related to anxiety, while high BAS is related to conduct disorders or impulsivity.|$|E

A fixed adjustment cost leads to a trade-off between adjusting a process continuously and allowing the process to drift until a bound is violated. The problem of determining the best bounded adjustment policy and the optimal bounded adjustment parameter is addressed. Although the univariate bounded <b>adjustment</b> <b>problem</b> has received interest in the past, there has been little focus on the multivariate case in the literature. It has been shown that in the univariate case, the shape of the optimal adjustment policy is a dead band. Determining the shape of the optimal dead region and the parameter that defines this region in the multivariate case is a difficult problem. A State-Space model is formulated for the multivariate bounded process <b>adjustment</b> <b>problem</b> and a Kalman Filter based controller is used. With the help of simulation, the optimal bounded adjustment parameter is computed for two dead regionsubspace shapes. A numerical illustration of a semiconductor manufacturing process demonstrates the optimal bounded adjustment policy...|$|R

40|$|A characteristic-based semi-Lagrangian (CSL) {{method is}} {{developed}} for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. In the CSL method, the governing equations are first {{transformed into a}} system of equations in characteristic form and then the Lagrangian form of the transformed equations is solved along the characteristic directions. By definition of hyperbolicity, such a transformation always exists. The CSL method is first illustrated by applying it to the one-dimensional (1 -D) shallow water equations to solve the Rossby geostrophic <b>adjustment</b> <b>problem.</b> The authors then apply the CSL method to the 1 -D fully-compressible, non-hydrostatic atmospheric equations to solve the hydrostatic <b>adjustment</b> <b>problem.</b> Transient solutions for both the linear and nonlinear problems are obtained and analyzed. It is shown that the CSL method produces more accurate solutions than the conventional semi-implicit semi-Lagrangian (SISL) method. It is also shown that the open boundary conditions can be easily implemented using the CSL method, which provides another advantage of the CSL method for regional atmospheric modeling. The extension to multi-dimensional hyperbolic systems is discussed and a simple demonstration is presented. The present study indicates that, although the SISL method is commonly used in the atmospheric models, the CSL method is potentially a better choice for fully-compressible, non-hydrostatic atmospheric modeling. Key words: characteristic-based semi-Lagrangian method; hyperbolic systems; non-hydrostatic modeling; open boundary condition. ...|$|R
