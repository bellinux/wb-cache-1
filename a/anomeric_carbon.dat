40|$|While the {{properties}} of biochar {{are closely related to}} its functional groups, it is unclear under what conditions biochar develops its properties. In this study, two-dimensional (2 D) (13) C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) correlation spectroscopy was for the first time applied to investigate the development of functional groups and establish their relationship with biochar properties. The results showed that the agricultural biomass carbonized to biochars was a dehydroxylation/dehydrogenation and aromatization process, mainly involving the cleavage of O-alkylated <b>carbons</b> and <b>anomeric</b> O-C-O <b>carbons</b> in addition to the production of fused-ring aromatic structures and aromatic C-O groups. With increasing charring temperature, the mass cleavage of O-alkylated groups and <b>anomeric</b> O-C-O <b>carbons</b> occurred prior to the production of fused-ring aromatic structures. The regression analysis between functional groups and biochar properties (pH and electrical conductivity) further demonstrated that the pH and electrical conductivity of rice straw derived biochars were mainly determined by fused-ring aromatic structures and <b>anomeric</b> O-C-O <b>carbons,</b> but the pH of rice bran derived biochars was determined by both fused-ring aromatic structures and aliphatic O-alkylated (HCOH) carbons.

30|$|Both diffusion-edited (Fig.  1 b) and T 2 -edited (Fig.  1 c) NMR {{experiments}} were hence acquired to simplify and enhance readability of proton spectra of RM samples. However, {{as compared to}} the conventional spectrum (Fig.  1 a), the NMR filters may lead to both a partial reduction of signal intensity and a distortion in J-coupling resolution. Nevertheless, T 2 -edited spectra (Fig.  1 c) allowed a clearer observation of singlets and multiplets of relatively fast-moving molecules, such as carbohydrates, organic acids, and nitrogen-containing compounds. The most intense signals in T 2 -edited spectra were attributed to lactose, choline, creatine, and several organic acids, including fumarate, citrate, and isobutyrate. Remarkably, most signals within the 5.3 – 3.33  ppm range rose from the magnetically non-equivalent hydroxy-alkyl protons of glucopyranosyl and galactopyranosyl moieties of lactose disaccharide.

Oligonucleotides incorporating the universal nucleoside 2 are capable of forming base pairs with the four normal DNA nucleosides without significant structural discrimination.

40|$|Bacterial {{cellulose}} (BC) is {{a matrix}} for a biofilm formation, which {{is critical for}} survival and persistence of microbes in harsh environments. BC could {{play a significant role}} in the formation of microbial mats in pristine ecosystems on Earth. The prime objective of this study was to measure to what extent spectral and other characteristics of BC were changed under the performance of BC interaction with the earthly rock – anorthosite – via microorganisms. The spectral analyses (Fourier Transform Infrared FT-IR, spectroscopy, and atomic absorption spectroscopy) showed unprecedented accumulation of chemical elements in the BC-based biofilm. The absorption capacity of IR by BC was shielded a little by mineral crust formed by microorganisms on the BC based biofilm surface, especially clearly seen in the range of 1200 - 900 cm− 1 in FT-IR spectra. Confocal scanning laser microscopy analysis revealed that elements bioleached from anorthosite created surface coats on the BC nanofibril web. At the same time, the vibrational spectra bands showed the presence of the characteristic region of <b>anomeric</b> <b>carbons</b> (960 – 730 cm- 1), wherein a band at 897 cm- 1 confirmed the presence of β- 1, 4 - linkages, which may serve as the cellulose fingerprint region.

This research has extended to study the formation of bis-spiroketals. As valuable natural products, bis-spiroketals are important synthesis targets, and the stereochemistry at the <b>anomeric</b> <b>carbons</b> is especially important. This research focuses on how sulfinyl ironeD) tricarbonyl diene complexes can help control the stereoselectivity ofbis-spiroketal formation. The first attempt to make the desired bis-spiroketal involved preparmg a dihydroxy diketone precursor, which would undergo dehydrative cyclization. Unfortunately, there were various obstacles to preparing the precursor. Attempts to oxidize double bonds, remove dithiane protecting groups, and form the sulfinyl diene failed. Due to the many obstacles, a new synthesis was devised involving a gold catalyst. This course of action required the coupling of a hemi-acetal with an alkyne, so the hope was that the alkyne would be more stable and easier to work with than the dihydroxy diketone. Unfortunately, attempts to form the ironeD) tricarbonyl complex with the diene did not work when the diene also had an alkyne. When the complex was formed prior to the addition of the alkyne, nucleophilic addition of the alkyne failed. However, this complex was applied to the original synthesis to create the dihydroxy diketone precursor. While the final product was never synthesized, the most recent discovery is close. Following a simple oxidation of an alcohol and hydrogenation of an alkene, the original precursor should be ready to undergo dehydrative cyclization...|$|R

In these studies both one-dimensional and two-dimensional experiments {{were carried out}} on the trisaccharide (NeuAc) 3 and colominic acid.

The NMR data indicate that these conformational differences extend to both terminal disaccharides of oligosaccharides larger than (NeuAc) 5, a result that has considerable physical and biological significance. In the context of the group B meningococcal polysaccharide, it provides an explanation for the conformational epitope of the group B meningococcal polysaccharide, which was proposed on the evidence that (NeuAc) 10, larger than the optimum size of an antibody site, was the smallest oligosaccharide able to bind to group B polysaccharide specific antibodies. Because the two terminal disaccharides of (NeuAc) 10 differ in conformation to its inner residues, the immunologically functional part of (NeuAc) 10 resides in its inner six residues.

It also had IR absorption bands for hydroxyl groups (3452, 3401, 3325 cm- 1) and an aromatic ring (1629, 1515 cm- 1). On the basis of mass spectrum and 13 C NMR spectra the molecular ion peak of the compound was determined at m/z 486 consistent to the molecular formula of a coumarin diglycoside C 21 H 26 O 13. The 1 H NMR spectrum showed the presence of two AB-type doublets at δ 6.83 (J[*]=[*] 9.2 Hz) and 7.47 (J[*]=[*] 9.2 Hz) assigned to vinylic H- 3 and H- 4 protons, respectively.

Two one-proton doublets at δ 5.27 (J[*]=[*] 3.6 Hz) and 4.99 (J[*]=[*] 3.6 Hz) were accounted to α-oriented anomeric H- 1 I and H- 1 II protons, respectively.

Here, pulse sequences that address this failure are developed using (13) C-enriched oligosaccharides of the glycosaminoglycan, hyaluronan, as model systems. Two pulse sequences are presented that exploit the unique chemical shifts and scalar couplings present at the carboxylate moiety to filter out coherences from the N-acetylated sugars and produce simple spectra containing only resonances from the acidic sugars. The first sequence uses one-bond couplings to correlate the carboxylate carbon with the adjacent carbon and its directly attached proton, while the second sequence exploits a long-range coupling to correlate the carboxylate <b>carbon</b> with the <b>anomeric</b> proton and <b>carbon</b> of the same residue. In addition, inclusion of an isotropic mixing block into these sequences allows resonances from the otherwise degenerate ring protons to be resolved. Spectra from the hyaluronan tetra- and hexasaccharides show that all glucuronic acid (GlcA) residues can be resolved from one another, allowing nuclei to be assigned in a sequence-specific manner. However, in some spectra, resonances are observed at positions not predicted by spin-operator analysis, and simulations reveal that these additional magnetisation transfers result from strong-coupling.
