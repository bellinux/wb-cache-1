5|$|Katsuo Nakamura as Masayoshi Harada, Sota's grandfather. He gives {{many words}} of wisdom to Sota, <b>and</b> <b>gently</b> advises Sota not to hate anyone or bear any grudges for the {{circumstances}} and predicaments in his life. He later dies due to a long-running illness.|$|E
5|$|Built on former {{reservation}} {{lands of}} Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache Indians, Lawton {{was founded on}} August 6, 1901, and was named after Major General Henry Ware Lawton, a Civil War Medal of Honor recipient killed in action in the Philippine–American War. Lawton's landscape {{is typical of the}} Great Plains, with flat topography <b>and</b> <b>gently</b> rolling hills, while the area north of the city is marked by the Wichita Mountains.|$|E
5|$|The {{eastern part}} of the island is a lowland plateau, with {{isolated}} ponds <b>and</b> <b>gently</b> rolling hills. There is low but abundant vegetation, consisting of mosses, lichens, liverworts, ferns, grasses, sedges, and crowberry. The center of the island is mountainous, and the western end is barren and vegetation is sparse.|$|E
60|$|PRAED [recovering {{himself with}} an effort <b>and</b> {{speaking}} <b>gently</b> <b>and</b> gravely] Now listen to me, my dear Crofts. [He sits down again].|$|R
6000|$|... "Put {{down those}} spurs and bring pillows.--Evan, {{lend a hand}} on the other side, <b>and</b> lift <b>gently</b> <b>and</b> steadily.--Oh Dear, shove that pillow under--easy, easy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she begged. [...] "It {{is death}} to uncover now. Bury your face here, against my parka, <b>and</b> breathe <b>gently</b> <b>and</b> do no talking--see, the way I am doing." ...|$|R
5|$|Yellow tea: This tea is {{processed}} {{in a similar}} manner to green tea, but instead of immediate drying after fixation, it is stacked, covered, <b>and</b> <b>gently</b> heated in a humid environment. This initiates oxidation in the chlorophyll of the leaves through non-enzymatic and non-microbial means, which results in a yellowish or greenish-yellow colour.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} this {{assignment}} that she suffered a near-catastrophe when she ran aground on Pearl Rock, near Gibraltar in 1871 and nearly sank. Agincourt was leading the inshore column of ships, contrary to normal practice where the senior flagship lead the inshore column, <b>and</b> <b>gently</b> ran aground sideways when the senior flagship's navigator failed {{to compensate for the}} set of the tide. Warrior, immediately following her, nearly collided with her, but managed to sheer off in time.|$|E
5|$|Mimesis is practised by {{animals such as}} {{the leafy}} sea dragon, Phycodurus eques, and the leaf scorpionfish, Taenianotus triacanthus, which {{resemble}} parts of plants, <b>and</b> <b>gently</b> rock their bodies as if swayed by a current. In the fish species Novaculichthys taeniourus, the rockmover or dragon wrasse, there is a striking difference in appearance between the adults and the juveniles. A juvenile Rockmover resembles a loose piece of sea weed. It swims in a vertical position with its head pointing downwards, and behaves {{in a way that}} perfectly resembles the movement of a piece of seaweed: moving {{back and forth in the}} surge, as if it was inanimate.|$|E

6000|$|Whichever the sex, {{whatever}} the season or place, he may go freshly <b>and</b> [...] <b>gently</b> <b>and</b> safely, by day or by night; He has the pass-key of hearts--to him {{the response of}} the prying of hands [...] on the knobs.|$|R
60|$|Japp {{had taken}} out a handkerchief, <b>and</b> was <b>gently</b> dabbing his brow.|$|R
5|$|Frustrated at {{not being}} {{accepted}} as a serious actor, Leno became obsessed {{with the idea of}} playing Richard III and other great Shakespearean roles, inundating the actor–manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree with his proposals. After his final run of Mother Goose at the Drury Lane Theatre in early 1903, Leno's delusions overwhelmed him. On the closing evening, and again soon afterwards, he travelled to the home of Constance Collier, who was Beerbohm Tree's leading lady at His Majesty's Theatre, and also followed her to rehearsal there. He attempted to persuade her to act alongside him in a Shakespearean season that Leno was willing to fund. On the second visit to her home, Leno brought Collier a jewellery box holding a diamond-encrusted plaque. Recognising that Leno was having a mental breakdown, she sadly <b>and</b> <b>gently</b> refused his offer, and Leno left distraught.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the thornback guitarfish is heart-shaped, slightly {{longer than it}} is wide, and thick towards the front. The snout is short and broad, with a blunt tip protruding slightly from the disc. The eyes are small and widely spaced; the spiracles are larger than the eyes and lie closely behind. The wide nostrils are preceded by moderately large, broad flaps of skin. The mouth is wide <b>and</b> <b>gently</b> arched; there are a pair of creases running from the mouth corners to the nostrils, enclosing a roughly trapezoidal area. The lower lip is inscribed by a deep furrow that wraps around the mouth corners. The small teeth have low crowns that may be sharp to blunt, and are arranged in 68–82 rows in the upper jaw and 64–78 rows in the lower jaw. The five pairs of gill slits are small and located beneath the disc.|$|E
5|$|True to its name, the winghead shark's cephalofoil {{consists}} {{of a pair of}} long, narrow, <b>and</b> <b>gently</b> swept-back blades. The width of the cephalofoil is equal to 40–50% of the shark's total length. The front of the cephalofoil has a slight indentation in the middle and a gentle bump on each side in front of the nostrils. Each nostril is roughly twice as long as the width of the mouth and extends along almost the entire leading margin of each blade. The circular eyes, located at the forward outer corners of the cephalofoil, are equipped with protective nictitating membranes. The relatively small, arched mouth contains 15–16 upper and 14 lower tooth rows on each side, and sometimes also a single row of tiny teeth at the upper and/or lower symphyses (jaw midpoints). The teeth are small and smooth-edged, with angled triangular cusps. Five pairs of gill slits are seen, with the fifth pair over the pectoral fin origins.|$|E
60|$|Jonas {{jumped off}} of the horse, handed the bridle to Rollo, and took up a long stick lying on the ground, <b>and</b> very <b>gently</b> <b>and</b> {{cautiously}} drew the nest, in to the shore. He took it up with great care, {{and brought it to}} Rollo.|$|R
60|$|And as he spoke, he bent down, <b>and</b> detached, <b>gently</b> enough, a {{magnificent}} necklace.|$|R
60|$|The reply on the skipper's lips {{merged into}} a grunt, {{and he went}} below. The sailor was asleep, <b>and</b> {{breathing}} <b>gently</b> <b>and</b> regularly; and after regarding him for some time the watcher returned to the deck and busied himself with certain small duties preparatory to landing.|$|R
5|$|The pelagic {{stingray}} {{has a very}} thick, distinctively wedge-shaped pectoral fin disc one-third wider than long, with broadly curved leading margins, rather angular outer corners, and nearly straight trailing margins. The snout is short with a rounded tip. The eyes are minute and, unlike in other stingrays, do not protrude above the body; the spiracles (paired respiratory openings) follow immediate behind. There is a short but broad curtain of skin between the nostrils, with a weakly fringed rear margin. The mouth is small <b>and</b> <b>gently</b> arched, with deep furrows at the corners and a tiny projection {{at the center of}} the upper jaw that fits into an indentation on the lower jaw. There are anywhere from 0 to 15 forked papillae (nipple-like structures) in a row across the floor of the mouth. There are 2534 upper tooth rows and 2531 lower tooth rows; the teeth of both sexes have single, pointed cusps, but those of adult males are longer and sharper than those of adult females. The margins of the pelvic fins are nearly straight in front and become rounded at the tips and in back.|$|E
25|$|Smooth Island {{is easily}} {{accessible}} by boat or helicopter, whilst the island's smooth <b>and</b> <b>gently</b> undulating topography also favours {{the construction of}} a small airstrip for light planes.|$|E
25|$|The Tiger {{was always}} very {{closely related to the}} Titan of its time, sharing a ladder type frame dropped in the {{wheelbase}} <b>and</b> <b>gently</b> rising in curves over the axles, generally only differing in wheelbase.|$|E
60|$|Anne's {{sensitive}} nature {{felt the}} wound--but Anne's patient courage submitted. She put {{away from her}} the insolence which had tried to sting, <b>and</b> went on, <b>gently</b> <b>and</b> firmly, {{as if nothing had}} happened.|$|R
60|$|I {{leaned back}} in my non-rotary {{revolving}} chair <b>and</b> nodded <b>gently,</b> like a mandarin, at my paste-pot.|$|R
60|$|As he spoke, {{he dropped}} his hand to hers on the keys, <b>and</b> she <b>gently</b> withdrew it.|$|R
25|$|The general {{structure}} {{is almost always}} the same: posts and lintels support a large <b>and</b> <b>gently</b> curved roof, while the walls are paper-thin, often movable and never load-bearing. Arches and barrel roofs are completely absent. Gable and eave curves are gentler than in China and columnar entasis (convexity at the center) limited.|$|E
25|$|Palazzo Gozani di Treville, {{regarded}} as the most beautiful in the town and {{as one of the}} two most important works of Giovanni Battista Scapitta, the other being the church of Santa Catarina, mentioned above. The rococò atrium and courtyard are particularly praised, as is the long <b>and</b> <b>gently</b> curved façade which follows the path of Via Mameli.|$|E
25|$|The city {{is located}} {{on both sides of}} the Malacca River near its mouth, flowing into the Straits of Malacca. The city is {{approximately}} 152kilometres from Malaysia's capital city, Kuala Lumpur. Due to large-scale land reclamation, it has grown in size, especially in the south. Its physical features are characterised by flat <b>and</b> <b>gently</b> undulating land stretching from its coast.|$|E
6000|$|... "Down {{with the}} sail, Mike," [...] cried the guide, {{at the same}} time putting the helm hard up. The beat flew round, obedient to the ruling power, made one last plunge as it left the rolling surf behind, <b>and</b> slid <b>gently</b> <b>and</b> {{smoothly}} into still water under the lee of the point.|$|R
60|$|The man smoked {{in silence}} for several moments. Then he withdrew the pipe from his teeth <b>and</b> sighed <b>gently.</b>|$|R

25|$|High Rigg {{resembles a}} model of the Lakeland Fells in miniature, {{complete}} with crags, intermediate tops, tarns and even a 'pass' crossing the ridge halfway along, complete with church. The northern and southern aspects of the fell are largely grassed <b>and</b> <b>gently</b> rolling, in contrast to the western and eastern flanks which are steep with numerous rocky outcroppings and cliffs.|$|E
25|$|Jean Webster (pseudonym for Alice Jane Chandler Webster, July 24, 1876 – June 11, 1916) was an American {{writer and}} author of many books {{including}} Daddy-Long-Legs and Dear Enemy. Her best-known books feature lively and likeable young female protagonists who come of age intellectually, morally, and socially, but with enough humor, snappy dialogue, <b>and</b> <b>gently</b> biting social commentary to make her books palatable and enjoyable to contemporary readers.|$|E
25|$|Stretches and {{isometric}} exercises {{will aid}} in prevention for persons at risk. Stretching before the activity and during breaks will aid in alleviating tension at the wrist. Place the hand firmly {{on a flat}} surface <b>and</b> <b>gently</b> press for a few seconds to stretch the wrist and fingers. An example for an isometric exercise of the wrist is done by clenching the fist tightly, releasing and fanning out fingers. None of these stretches or exercises should cause pain or discomfort.|$|E

6000|$|Her {{shoulders}} {{shook as}} though she had been sobbing, and he forgot himself in the contemplation of her hair. Suddenly he gave a start, as if waking up, <b>and</b> asked very <b>gently</b> <b>and</b> not much above a whisper-- ...|$|R
60|$|His gaiety {{suddenly}} left him. He {{lifted one}} of his hands, and waved it to <b>and</b> fro <b>gently</b> in the air.|$|R
