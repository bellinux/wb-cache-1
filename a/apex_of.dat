40|$|In {{the present}} work we {{search for the}} minimal {{forbidden}} minors (also called obstructions) for the class <b>of</b> <b>apexes</b> <b>of</b> partial 2 -trees. Because this class is minor closed, by Robertson-Seymour's theorem it has a nite set of obstructions. The set of obstructions {{is one of the}} possible characterizations of every minor closed class. We analyze a structure of possible obstructions for the class <b>of</b> <b>apexes</b> <b>of</b> partial 2 -trees and thanks to this knowledge, we can classify all the obstructions for the class <b>of</b> <b>apexes</b> <b>of</b> partial 2 -trees except for some special type of them with pathwidth three.

Below the <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> the obelisk, on the memorial's base, are two additional sculpted figures, a Union infantry soldier and a Union cavalry soldier. The Union infantryman is dressed in a cap, long coat, and a cape, much like the figure atop the obelisk.

5|$|Basil II is {{considered}} among the most capable Byzantine emperors and his reign as the <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> the empire in the Middle Ages. By 1025, the date of Basil II's death, the Byzantine Empire stretched from Armenia in the east to Calabria in Southern Italy in the west. Many successes had been achieved, ranging from the conquest of Bulgaria to the annexation of parts of Georgia and Armenia, and the reconquest of Crete, Cyprus, and the important city of Antioch. These were not temporary tactical gains but long-term reconquests.|$|E

Similar aquatic behavior was commonly depicted for other large sauropods, such as Brachiosaurus and Apatosaurus. A 1951 study by Kenneth A. Kermack indicates that sauropods probably could not have breathed through their nostrils {{when the rest of the}} body was submerged, as the water pressure on the chest wall would be too great. Since the 1970s, general consensus has the sauropods as firmly terrestrial animals, browsing on trees, ferns, and bushes.|$|E

The King tried to limit access to higher offices to Catholics. Anti-Protestant riots took place in some cities. During the Sandomierz Rebellion of 1606 the Protestants supported the anti-King opposition in large numbers. Nevertheless, the massive wave of szlachta's return to Catholicism could not have been stopped.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} his reign, Neferhotep I {{shared the}} throne with his brother Sihathor, a coregency that lasted a few months to a year. Sihathor died shortly before Neferhotep, who {{probably}} then appointed another brother, Sobekhotep IV, as coregent. In any case, Sobekhotep IV succeeded Neferhotep I soon afterwards, and reigned over Egypt for almost a decade. The reigns of the two brothers mark the <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> the 13th Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Amenemhat IV {{first came}} to power as a junior coregent of his {{predecessor}} Amenemhat III, whose reign marks the <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> the Middle Kingdom period. The coregency is well attested by numerous monuments and artefacts where {{the names of the}} two kings parallel each other. The length of this coregency is uncertain; it could have lasted from one to seven years, although most scholars believe it was only two years long. The Turin Canon, a king list redacted during the early Ramesside period, records Amenemhat IV on Column 6, Row 1, and credits him with a reign of 9 years, 3 months and 27 days. Amenemhat IV is also recorded on Entry 65 of the Abydos King List and Entry 38 of the Saqqara Tablet, both of which date to the New Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Apical {{periodontitis}} is acute {{or chronic}} inflammation around the <b>apex</b> <b>of</b> a tooth {{caused by an}} immune response to bacteria within an infected pulp. It does not occur because of pulp necrosis, meaning that a tooth that tests as if it's alive (vital) may cause apical periodontitis, and a pulp which has become non-vital due to a sterile, non-infectious processes (such as trauma) may not cause any apical periodontitis. Bacterial cytotoxins reach the region around {{the roots of the}} tooth via the apical foramina and lateral canals, causing vasodilation, sensitization of nerves, osteolysis (bone resorption) and potentially abscess or cyst formation.|$|E
