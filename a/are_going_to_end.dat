5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you had never thought of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>end.</b>|$|E

500|$|Martin E. Cirulis of Computer Gaming World {{wrote that}} Command & Conquer [...] "remains mainly a good, networkable version of Dune II". Cirulis found the game's {{interface}} intuitive and described its online component as [...] "sophisticated and easy-to-use", also praising its story for being [...] "as interesting as the actual tactics and gunfire", and commented that he [...] "would buy C {{just to see}} where things <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> up". However, according to him, the developers failed [...] "to correct major shortcomings" [...] in Dune II, as its fog of war does not fit with the real-world setting, also finding fault with design choices in the game's missions, which he believed were structured like [...] "puzzles" [...] that allowed for {{only one way to}} win. Nevertheless, he concluded that it remained [...] "the best-looking and sounding strategy game yet" [...] despite its flaws, and that it was [...] "more than entertaining enough to make up for its shortcomings." [...] Writing for PC Gamer US, T. Liam McDonald wrote that the game [...] "has all the playability of Dune II, but with more diverse units, more unusual scenarios, and impressively executed wraparound cutscenes." [...] McDonald called its combat a [...] "satisfying blend of action and strategy", and noted that this, combined with an attention to [...] "little details", made the game a [...] "success", also praising its cutscenes as [...] "terrifically executed". Although he was disappointed that the game lacked [...] "fancier terrain or another zoom level", McDonald concluded: [...] "This game is a whole lot of fun, so get it, play it, and love it like your own child." ...|$|E

It is against the {{government}} that taxes them so heavily that their anger is directed, and I fear that this new poll-tax that has been ordered will drive them to extremities. I have news that across the river in Essex the people of some places have not only refused to pay, but have forcibly driven away the tax-gatherers, and when these things once begin, {{there is no}} saying how they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>end.</b> However, if there is trouble, I think not that at first we shall be in any danger here, but if they have success at first their pretensions will grow. They will inflame themselves. The love of plunder will take the place of their reasonable objections to over-taxation, and seeing that they have but to stretch out their hands to take what they desire, plunder and rapine will become general." ...|$|E

Every thinking person in Russia regrets that this thing should have come to pass at such a time. Yet it is best for you English to look the truth in the face. It wasn't the Russian people who were pledged to you, with whom you were bound in alliance. It was that accursed trick all European politicians have of making secret treaties and secret understandings, building up buffer States, trying to whittle away a piece of the map for yourselves, trying all the time to be dishonest under the shadow of what is called diplomacy. That is what brought the war about. It was never the will of the people. It was the Hohenzollerns and the Romanoffs, the firebrands of the French Cabinet, and your own clumsy, thick-headed efforts to get the best of everybody and yet keep your Nonconformist conscience. The people did not make this war, but it is the people who <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> it." ...|$|E

It {{seems to me}} mean, making your living out of work that does no good to anyone. I hate the bargaining, but the farming itself I love. Of course, it means having only one evening dress a year and making that myself. But even when I had a lot I always preferred wearing the one that I thought suited me the best. As for the children, they are as healthy as young savages, and everything {{they want to make}} them happy is just outside the door. The boys won't go to college; but seeing they will have to earn their own living, that, perhaps, is just as well. It is mother, poor dear, that worries so." [...] She laughed again.

6000|$|... "Weavel," [...] he said, [...] "and you, my friends, I am {{not here}} {{to say a word}} in favour of either of the two {{candidates}} between whom you have to choose to-day. I am here just because you are valued members of the great party which before very long will be carrying upon its shoulders the burden of this country's government, to tell you of one measure which some of you know of already, which may help you to realise how important your to-day's choice will be. You know quite as much about politics as I do. You know very well that the present Government is doomed. But for an unfortunate difference of opinion between two of our supporters who are present to-day, there is not the slightest doubt that the Government would lose their vote of confidence to-morrow, and that in that case, if I still remained your chief, I should be asked to form a Democratic Government, a task which, when the time comes, it is my intention to pass on to one more skilled in Parliamentary routine. I want to explain to you that we consider the representative you elect to-day {{to be one of the}} most important personages in that Government. We have not issued our programme yet. When we do, we are going to make the country a wonderful promise. We are going to promise that there shall be no more strikes. That sounds a large order, perhaps, but we shall keep our word and we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> for ever this bitter struggle between capital and labour by welding the two into one and by making the interests of one the interests of the other. Our scheme is that the person whom you elect to-day will be chairman of an inner conference of twelve. We shall ask you to elect a further three from amongst yourselves, which will give the trades unions four representatives upon this inner council. Four representative Cabinet Ministers will be chosen by ballot to add to their number. Four employers of labour, elected by the Employers' Association, will also join the council and the whole will be presided over by the person whom you elect to-day. There will be a select committee, or rather fifty-seven select committees, of each industry always at hand, and we consider that we shall frame in that manner a body of men competent to deal with the inner workings of every industry. They will decide what proportion of the earnings of each industry shall be allocated to labour and what to capital. In other words, they will fix or approve of or revise the wages of the country. They will settle every dispute and their decision will be final. The funds held by the various trades unions will form charitable funds or be returned as bonuses to the contributors. I have given you the barest outline of the scheme which has been drawn up to form a part of our programme when the time comes for us to present one. To-day you are only concerned to elect the one representative. I am here to beg, gentlemen, that you elect one whose theories, whose principles, whose antecedents and whose general attitude towards labour problems will fit him to take a very important place in the future government of the country." ...|$|E
