5000|$|Torruella {{opened his}} Opinion Concurring in Part and Dissenting in Part, as follows: TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge (Concurring in part;  Dissenting in part). Although in a {{different}} format than presented on prior occasions, we once more have before us issues that arise by reason of the political inequality that exists within the body politic of the United States, as regards the four million citizens of this Nation who reside in Puerto Rico.This is a fundamental constitutional question that {{will not go away}} notwithstanding this Court's repeated efforts to suppress these issues.21  We can now add to that dismal list the endeavors of the lead opinion. This is a most unfortunate and denigrating predicament for citizens who for more than one hundred years have been branded with a stigma of inferiority, and all that follows therefrom.At the root of this problem is the unacceptable role of the courts. Their complicity in the perpetuation of this outcome is unconscionable. As in the case of racial segregation, see Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 557 (1896) (overruled by Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 347 U.S. 482 (1954)), it is the courts that are responsible for the creation of this inequality.22  Furthermore, it is the courts that have clothed this noxious condition in a mantle of legal respectability.But perhaps even more egregious {{is the fact that it}} is this judiciary that has mechanically parroted the outdated and retrograde underpinnings on which this invented inferiority is perpetuated. This result is now reached without so much as a minimum of analysis or consideration for the passage of time and the changed conditions, both legal and societal.23  These changed conditions have long undermined the foundations of these judge-made rules, which were established in a by-gone era in consonance with the distorted views of that epoch.24  Although the unequal treatment of persons because of the color of their skin or other irrelevant reasons, was then the modus operandi of governments, and an accepted practice of societies in general, the continued enforcement of these rules by the courts is today an outdated anachronism, to say the least. Such actions, particularly by courts of the United States, only serve to tarnish our judicial system as the standard-bearer of the best values to which our Nation aspires. Allowing these antiquated rules to remain in place, long after the unequal treatment of American citizens has become constitutionally, morally and culturally unacceptable in the rest of our Nation, see Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 347 U.S. 483, is an intolerable state of affairs which cannot be excused by hiding behind any theory of law.The conclusions of the lead opinion in refusing to consider the merit of Appellants' claims is particularly inexcusable because, as will be further elaborated, the present decision cannot be legitimately grounded on the Supreme Law of the Land, which requires that Appellants be provided an effective judicial remedy for the correction of the wrongs they allege. See International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, art. 2, § 3, Dec. 19, 1966, 999 U.N.T.S. 171 (hereinafter ICCPR) (“Each State Party the United States ․ undertakes to ensure that any person whose ICCPR rights are violated shall have an effective remedy,” and to ensure that these rights are “determined by competent judicial, administrative, or legislative authorities․”).  The suggestion that Appellants seek a political rather than a judicial remedy to correct the grievous violation of their rights claimed in this action, is, at a minimum, ironic given that it is precisely the lack of political representation that is the central issue in this case. It is this lack of any political power by these disenfranchised U.S. citizens, and the cat and mouse games that have been played with them by the United States government, including its courts, that have resulted in their interminable unequal condition.When this status of second-class citizenship is added to the also judicially established rule that grants Congress plenary powers over the territories and their inhabitants, i.e., that recognizes in Congress practically unfettered authority over the territories and their inhabitants,26 one has to ask what effective political process is the lead opinion suggesting be turned to by Appellants to resolve the constitutional issues raised by this case? In fact, the referral by the lead opinion to the exercise of political power by these disenfranchised citizens, as the solution to their political inequality is nothing more than the promotion of the continued colonial status that has existed since Puerto Rico was acquired by the United States as booty after the Spanish-American War of 1898.27  As such, this suggestion is totally lacking in consequence or substance, and undeserving of a serious response.With the primary vehicle for exerting effective political pressure being barred by the lack of elected voting representatives in Congress, it is a travesty to tout the political process as a means of vindicating the fundamental inequality of the United States citizens who reside in Puerto Rico. The lead opinion's ruling is the equivalent of having decided, before Brown v. Board of Education, that African-Americans should forgo their right to judicial action under the Constitution <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>map</b> to overruling the inequality promoted by Plessy.|$|E

40|$|More {{than ten}} years ago, in Culture and Imperialism, Said {{identified}} migration <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>map</b> to intellectual freedom, presented under {{the form of the}} “unhoused, decentered, and exilic energies” of culture, “whose incarnation today is the migrant, and whose consciousness is that of the intellectual and artist in exile, the political figure between domains, between forms, between homes, and between languages” (Edward Said, Culture and Imperialism, London, Vintage, 1994, p. 403). This condition of in-betweenness and hybridity fosters a comprehensive sense of plurality in which different aspects of life are called into question. Domains, forms, homes and languages are the main key sites on which the notion of migration operates; literary forms are one of the ways through which this operation is performed. Nadine Gordimer’s The Pickup allows a deep exploration of various aspects linked to the migratory experience, each of them retaining, on its turn, a multiplicity of symbolic implications. First of all, the geographical displacement of the two protagonists from the city of Johannesburg to a small country village near the desert poses the Middle East culture as opposed to the South African reality. One of the crucial aspects of the novel is the reconsideration of place connected to the idea of migration not intended towards western countries anymore, but considered as a transit within African countries. Interesting assumptions result from the reading of migration as a social and cultural point of intersection which gives birth to new forms of identity. The characters’ lives tend towards “another country” a third place that is the metaphor of cultural wholeness but also a place where they can find their own new dimension of “other”. Migration is here intended as the performing of different inner evolutions; changing place can alternatively signify a total nullification of one’s own identity or the building of a new one shaped according to the rules given by a new society. Finally, migration concerns language, ways of expression, and modes of communication. The search of a new dimension is introduced through the presence of two different languages (English and Arabic), as well as through the relevance given to the distinction between written and spoken idioms, based on Michel de Certeau’s assumption of ‘orality as the space of the other’. The aim of my paper is to show how Said’s ‘decentered, and exilic energies’ of culture produced by individuals, identities and languages on the move are not only a means to reach liberation intended as an intellectual task, but also pose questions concerning the meaning of metaphorical migrations, the entity of the borders being crossed, the transformations occurring while these movements are taking place...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{declaration}} of Education for All (EFA) in Jomtien in 1990 which was reaffirmed in Dakar 2000, it has become widely accepted that education for girls has {{a profound effect on}} sustainable development. More importantly women 2 ̆ 7 s education has been linked to low maternal and infant mortality rates in Third World Countries. Studies carried out by a number of scholars established significant correlation between a woman 2 ̆ 7 s schooling and her children 2 ̆ 7 s learning opportunities (Stromquist, 2005, p. 142). They contend that intergenerational benefits resulting from female schooling are considerably higher than from male schooling hence increasing girls 2 ̆ 7 education and women 2 ̆ 7 s literacy provides enormous benefits to individuals and families. As a result, literacy for women and girls has become a major focus of attention in many developing countries. Notwithstanding this renewed focus on girls 2 ̆ 7 education and {{the role of women in}} development, country strategies such as Bhutan 2 ̆ 7 s Ninth Five-Year National Development Plan have not made significant attempts to adequately define the role of women, and particularly nuns in the pursuit of Gross National Happiness (GNH). Bhutan 2 ̆ 7 s development philosophy, GNH which focuses on social indicators was proclaimed by the King in juxtaposition to the global economic indicator Gross National Product (GNP) <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>map</b> to its mode of development. Ten years after its introduction, the role of women in Bhutan 2 ̆ 7 s development agenda and the pursuit of gross national happiness remain undefined and marginal. This study therefore seeks to examine the existing gaps in Bhutan 2 ̆ 7 s development philosophy with a focus on the role of nuns in national development. Drawing on feminist and critical theories grounded in discourses on gender equity, this study questions whether countries, and specifically Bhutan, have the political will and commitment to transform the lives of rural women, including nuns, by redefining their role in the 21 st century focusing on their educational and literacy needs. The study, utilizing frameworks grounded in Women in Development (WID), Women and Development (WAD), and Gender and Development (GAD) discourse, highlights significant gaps in the education sector in terms of support, management, coordination, supervisions, and oversight of the quality of learning at nunneries with a view to drawing attention to critical gender equity issues in Bhutanese society.

A discussion of Foucault&# 039;s technologies of self and Heidegger&# 039;s questioning of the work of art assists the argument to take account of subjectivity and the politics of power relations in institutional practices and discourses.

Here’s just one example; China has experienced a seven-fold increase in the frequency of floods since the 1950s, rising every decade. The frequency of extreme rainfall has increased and is predicted to continue to increase in the western and southern parts of China. The country is currently undertaking efforts to reduce the threat of these floods (which have the potential effect of completely destroying vulnerable communities), largely focusing on improving the infrastructure responsible for tracking and maintaining adequate water levels. That being said, the country is promoting the extension of technologies for water allocation and water-saving mechanisms.

The alternative investigations are ultrasound, 3 -D magnetic resonance angiography (3 -D MRA) and computed tomography angiography. This pilot study aimed to assess whether 3 -D MRA could replace the gold standard angiography in preoperative planning. Eight patients considered for aortoiliac or infrainguinal arterial bypass surgery were recruited. All underwent both imaging modalities within 7 days. A vascular surgeon and a radiologist each reported on the images from both the 3 -D MRA and the angiography, with blinding to patient details and each others reports. Comparisons were made between the reports for the angiographic and the 3 -D MRA images, and between the reports of the vascular surgeon and the radiologist. Compared to the gold standard angiogram, 3 -D MRA had a sensitivity of 77 % and specificity of 94 % in detecting occlusion, and a sensitivity of 72 % and specificity of 90 % in differentiating high grade (> 50 %) versus low grade (< 50 %) stenoses.

As Leila Shahid, speaker of the PNA in Europe declared, the sole fact of carrying out the plan unilaterally already showed that the plan was only thought of according to the objectives of Israel as viewed by Sharon.

40|$|The Austrian Federal Ministry of Health aims {{to improve}} the health of all people living in Austria and to {{decrease}} health and social inequalities. This leads to a careful planning and distribution of the available health care resources to meet government aims. The research project SALUD, funded by the Federal Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology and the Austrian Science Fund, focuses on building a Spatial Microsimulation Model for Austria by combining survey and census data to model small area health issues based on individuals or households where no data exists, so called missing data. Within this project, a first prototype of simSALUD is developed, which is a Web-based spatial microsimulation application for health decision support as to date no flexible and free-available Web application {{in the area of}} spatial microsimulation exists. simSALUD targets two groups: experts in the area and health policy decision makers (HPDM). The present work focuses on the latter group and will highlight the benefits of simSALUD for HPDM, as they are mainly interested in the results and not primarily in the underlying modelling process. The first prototype of simSALUD is a Web-based application that can be used either offline or online and is therefore accessible anywhere and anytime. Functionally it consists of three modules called (i) data loader, (ii) visualisation area, and (iii) geoprocessing tools. - The data loader supports the management of different datasets (loading, overlaying, sorting, etc.). The main benefit here is that HPDM may access a shared pool of open simulated data that is otherwise hardly available. - The visualisation area presents an interactive map with different standard functionalities, including zoom and pan. This is especially valuable for HPDM as hotspots and problem areas on maps can often be identified more easily than lots of numbers in a list. - The geoprocessing tools, such as ?create buffer? or ?location optimization? allow doing spatial analysis on data to answer what-if scenarios. In general, the main advantage of simSALUD is that HPDM can use the application and perform various spatial analyses without needing specialist skills in spatial microsimulation modelling or geoinformation science. The first prototype of SimSALUD will be introduced to our project partners in their health departments in order to evaluate its practical usefulness and relevance in the area of regional health planning. This work will discuss the results of the evaluation, highlighting {{the pros and cons of}} <b>the</b> prototype <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> defining <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>map</b> for futures developments of simSALUD. Hence, with simSALUD we hope to make a positive contribution for the area of spatial microsimulation modelling, <b>as</b> it is <b>the</b> first open accessible Web application so far...|$|R
