25|$|The Tu-124 {{retained}} <b>a</b> <b>drogue</b> parachute {{to be used}} in {{an emergency}} landing or landing on a slippery surface and had low pressure tires to aid operation from unpaved airfields. As on the Tu-104 the engines were integrated into the wings, but the turbofan engines were more fuel efficient. The placement of the engines amplified vibrations, which affected the comfort of the passenger cabin, and also the fatigue lifetime of the wing assembly.|$|E
25|$|A rocket parachute, the PRSM-915, was {{developed}} to ensure the vehicle's safe landing. To use the parachute, the BMD is first packed onto a special pallet before takeoff. To drop the BMD, <b>a</b> <b>drogue</b> chute is released that initially drags the BMD out of the Il-76 transport plane. Once clear of the plane a single large main chute opens. The deployment of the main chute triggers the deployment of four long rods which hang beneath the pallet. As soon as the rods touch the ground a retrorocket fires, slowing the BMD to a descending speed between 6m/s and 7m/s and giving it a relatively soft landing. It allowed a BMD to be relatively safely parachuted with both the driver and the gunner. This system entered service in 1975 for the BMD-1, and was always used for the BMD-2 afterwards.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} part of 1965 about one dozen {{personnel}} of the 109th Quartermaster Corps, U.S. Army, were sent TDY to Eglin Air Force Base, where they assisted Air Force personnel developing an air delivery technique called the low-altitude parachute extraction system (LAPES). The 109th's mission was to provide parachute packing, temporary storage and rigging of supplies and equipment for aerial drop by aircraft of all the services. In addition, the 109th was to render technical assistance in the recovery and evacuation of airdrop equipment. Using the LAPES system, while a cargo plane flew a few feet above ground level, <b>a</b> <b>drogue</b> parachute would be released, pulling palletized cargo out of the aircraft and onto the drop zone. An alternative method was the ground proximity extraction system (GPES), in which cargo was yanked from the aircraft by a hook that snagged a cable traversing the runway. At full strength the unit would be capable of preparing 200 tons of material per day for delivery by free, high velocity or low-velocity drop techniques.|$|E
40|$|A test of {{instrumentation}} fabricated {{to measure}} {{the performance of a}} free drifting buoy as a (Lagrangian) current meter is described.

2500|$|The {{plane had}} very unusual takeoff requirements, with a 14° {{angle of attack}} needed for the {{rotation}} at about [...] for a 150,000 pound combat weight. This poor takeoff performance was also evident with the high landing speed that necessitated <b>a</b> <b>drogue</b> parachute for braking.|$|E
2500|$|The Convair B-58 Hustler Mach 2 bomber and North American XB-70 Valkyrie Mach 3 bomber {{prototype}} had individual encapsulated seats. [...] A cabin ejection for the XB-70 Valkyrie {{was also}} tested. The B-58's capsule had a control stick, {{a bottle of}} oxygen, and <b>a</b> <b>drogue</b> chute.|$|E

50|$|SSVP {{consists}} of two components; an active probe, and <b>a</b> passive <b>drogue.</b> The probe enters the drogue, and its tip is grasped by soft-capture latches which are then retracted using electrically-driven motors to provide close alignment. Eight hard-capture locks then firmly attach the two spacecraft. After hard docking, the pressure between spacecraft is equalized using the Interface Leak Check System.|$|R
2500|$|In 1951, as part {{of testing}} of {{aircraft}} for Strategic Air Command Escape and Evasion missions, the prototype USAF Douglas YC-47F [...] "Super DC-3" [...] conducted short-field landings with and without <b>a</b> <b>drogue</b> chute as well as RATO (rocket assisted take-off) tests from rough terrain at Eglin Air Force Base. Also tested was the Chase XC-123 Avitruc modified from the Chase XCG-20 glider, and a Fairchild C-119C Flying Boxcar.|$|E
2500|$|At a sport skydiver's {{deployment}} altitude, {{the individual}} manually deploys a small pilot-chute which acts as <b>a</b> <b>drogue,</b> catching air and {{pulling out the}} main parachute or the main canopy. There are two principal systems in use: the [...] "throw-out", where the skydiver pulls a toggle attached {{to the top of}} the pilot-chute stowed in a small pocket outside the main container: and the [...] "pull-out", where the skydiver pulls a small pad attached to the pilot-chute which is stowed inside the container.|$|E
2500|$|An {{extremely}} useful aerial tanker in Desert Storm was the USAF KC-10A Extender. Besides being {{larger than}} the other tankers, the KC-10A is equipped with the USAF [...] "boom" [...] refueling and also the [...] "hose-and-drogue" [...] system. This {{makes it possible for}} the KC-10A to refuel USAF aircraft, and also USMC and US Navy jets that use the [...] "probe-and-drogue" [...] system, and also allied aircraft, such as those from the UK and Saudi Arabia. KC-135s may be equipped with <b>a</b> <b>drogue</b> depending on the mission profile.|$|E
5|$|Landing the {{aircraft}} required {{the extension of}} the retractable landing skid and the deployment of <b>a</b> braking <b>drogue</b> parachute. <b>As</b> pilots could access the plane only from a hatch above the cockpit, the pilot would have to enter the E.381 before it could be attached to the carrier Ar 234C and had no way to escape in case of an emergency, while attached to the carrier.|$|R
50|$|A soft dock was {{achieved}} when a probe {{at the top}} of the CSM was inserted into a hole in the center of <b>a</b> cone-shaped <b>drogue</b> {{at the top of}} the LM and three small capture latches closed. Hard dock {{was achieved}} by activating a mechanism which retracted the probe and caused twelve more capture latches to close around the Command Module's docking flange.|$|R
50|$|Based {{upon the}} Miles Master II, the Martinet {{featured}} a strengthened airframe {{to handle the}} stresses of towing <b>a</b> target <b>drogue.</b> Other differences from the Master included a longer nose, higher cockpit and greater wingspan, but otherwise the two aircraft shared many common components. The targets and towing gear were contained in a fairing beneath the fuselage and were retracted by an external, wind-powered winch.|$|R
2500|$|The {{squadron}} was reactivated as the 908th Expeditionary Air Refueling Squadron, {{a provisional}} squadron, about 2002 {{as a part}} of the War on Terror and equipped with McDonnell Douglas KC-10 Extenders. Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers were added in late 2003 until an undetermined time. The squadron has been active as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom conducting combat air refueling. [...] The squadron's KC-10s can refuel aircraft with either a boom or with <b>a</b> <b>drogue,</b> which makes it capable of refueling Air Force or Navy aircraft, as well as aircraft from other coalition air forces. [...] In 2010 the squadron flew the first combat mission with an all-female KC-10 crew. [...] While refueling strike aircraft in Afghanistan and Iraq, during 2011, the squadron supported an average of more than four [...] "Troops in Contact" [...] events daily and provided about a third of the airborne fuel used to protect ground forces. It is currently supporting the Military intervention against ISIL in Iraq and Syria.|$|E
2500|$|The {{spacecraft}} was cone shaped, with a neck at {{the narrow}} end. It had a convex base, which carried {{a heat shield}} (Item 2 in the diagram below) consisting of an aluminum honeycomb covered with multiple layers of fiberglass. Strapped to it was a retropack (1) consisting of three rockets deployed to brake the spacecraft during reentry. Between these were three minor rockets for separating the spacecraft from the launch vehicle at orbital insertion. The straps that held the package could be severed when {{it was no longer}} needed. Next to the heat shield was the pressurized crew compartment (3). Inside, an astronaut would be strapped to a form-fitting seat with instruments {{in front of him and}} with his back to the heat shield. Underneath the seat was the environmental control system supplying oxygen and heat, scrubbing the air of CO2, vapor and odors, and (on orbital flights) collecting urine. The recovery compartment (4) at the narrow end of the spacecraft contained three parachutes: <b>a</b> <b>drogue</b> to stabilize free fall and two main chutes, a primary and reserve. Between the heat shield and inner wall of the crew compartment was a landing skirt, deployed by letting down the heat shield before landing. On top of the recovery compartment was the antenna section (5) containing both antennas for communication and scanners for guiding spacecraft orientation. Attached was a flap used to ensure [...] the spacecraft was faced heat shield first during reentry. A launch escape system (6) was mounted to the narrow end of the spacecraft containing three small solid-fueled rockets which could be fired briefly in a launch failure to separate the capsule safely from its booster. It would deploy the capsule's parachute for a landing nearby at sea. (See also Mission profile for details.) ...|$|E

50|$|The {{first stage}} {{was made from}} friction-stir-welded 2219 {{aluminum}} alloy. It employs a common bulkhead between the LOX and RP-1 tanks, as well as flight pressure stabilization. It can be transported safely without pressurization (like the heavier Delta II isogrid design) but gains additional strength when pressurized for flight (like the Atlas II, {{which could not be}} transported unpressurized). The parachute system, built by Irvin Para&shy;chute Corp&shy;oration, uses <b>a</b> high-speed <b>drogue</b> chute and <b>a</b> main chute.|$|R
5000|$|RKG {{stands for}} Ruchnaya Kumulyativnaya Granata (Handheld Shaped Charge Grenade). When the pin is pulled and the grenade is thrown <b>a</b> four-panelled <b>drogue</b> {{parachute}} is deployed by a spring. This parachute stabilizes the grenade in flight and {{ensures that the}} grenade strikes the target at a 90 degree angle, maximising {{the effect of the}} shaped charge. Realistic accurately thrown ranges are within 15 to 25 meters, while the danger space from blast and fragmentation is within 50 meters.|$|R
60|$|The sight was {{received}} {{with a loud}} shout, and Tim Rokens leaped up and grasped a harpoon, but the whale sheered off. A spare harpoon lay on the stern-sheets close to Glynn, who dropped his oar and seized it. Almost without knowing what he was about, he hurled it with tremendous force at the monster's neck, into which it penetrated deeply. The harpoon fortunately happened to be attached to a large buoy, called by whalers <b>a</b> <b>drogue,</b> which was jerked {{out of the boat}} like a cannon-shot as the whale went down, carrying harpoon and drogue along with it.|$|E
6000|$|The {{evidence}} of Tim Rokens {{was clear and}} to the point. The whale had been first struck by Glynn with a harpoon, to which <b>a</b> <b>drogue</b> was attached; it had been followed up by {{the crew of the}} Red Eric and also by the crew of the Termagant. The boats of the latter over-took the fish first, fixed a harpoon in it, and lanced it mortally. The drogue and harpoon of the Red Eric were still attached to the whale when this was done, so that, according to the laws of the fishery, the crew of the Termagant had no right to touch the whale--it was a [...] "fast" [...] fish. If the drogue had become detached the fish would have been free, and both crews would have been entitled to chase and capture it if they were able. Angry words and threats had passed between the crews of the opposing boats, but the whale put a stop to that by smashing the boat of the Red Eric with its tail, whereupon the boat of the Termagant made off with the fish (which died almost immediately after), and left the crew of the boat belonging to the Red Eric struggling in the water.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>drogue</b> {{parachute}} is more elongated {{and has a}} {{far smaller}} area than a conventional parachute and therefore provides less drag. This means that <b>a</b> <b>drogue</b> parachute cannot slow an object {{as much as a}} conventional parachute, but it can be deployed at speeds at which conventional parachutes would be torn apart.|$|E
5000|$|Purpose-designed {{anti-tank}} grenades generally use the shaped charge {{principle to}} penetrate tank armor, although the squash head concept is also used. In military terminology, warheads employing shape charges are called High Explosive Anti-Tank (HEAT) warheads. Because {{of the way}} shaped charges function, the grenade must hit the vehicle at an exact right angle for the effect to work most efficiently. The grenade facilitates this by deploying <b>a</b> small <b>drogue</b> parachute or fabric streamers after being thrown.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for controlling and stabilizing <b>an</b> automated refueling <b>drogue.</b> The drogue automatically stabilizes {{in the presence}} of winds or receiver forebody effects using drogue canopy manipulation.
