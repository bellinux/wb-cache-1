40|$|Self-facilitation through {{ecosystem}} engineering (i. e., organism {{modification of}} the abiotic environment) and consumer-resource interactions are both major determinants of spatial patchiness in ecosystems. However, interactive effects of these two mechanisms on spatial complexity have not been extensively studied. We investigated the mechanisms underlying a spatial mosaic of low-tide exposed hummocks and waterlogged hollows on an intertidal mudflat in the Wadden Sea dominated by the seagrass Zostera noltii. A combination of field measurements, an experiment and a spatially explicit model indicated that the mosaic resulted from localized sediment <b>accretion</b> <b>by</b> seagrass followed by selective waterfowl grazing. Hollows were bare in winter, but were rapidly colonized by seagrass during the growth season. Colonized hollows were heavily grazed by brent geese and widgeon in autumn, converting these patches to a bare state again and disrupting sediment <b>accretion</b> <b>by</b> seagrass. In contrast, hummocks were covered by seagrass throughout the year and were rarely grazed, most likely because the waterfowl {{were not able to}} employ their preferred but water requiring feeding strategy (‘dabbling’) here. Our study exemplifies that interactions between ecosystem engineering by a foundation species (seagrass) and consumption (waterfowl grazing) can increase spatial complexity at the landscape level. ...|$|R

40|$|Many {{galaxies are}} {{expected}} to harbor binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in their centers. Their interaction with the surrounding gas results in accretion and exchange of angular momentum via tidal torques, facilitating binary inspiral. Here we explore the non-trivial coupling between these two processes and analyze how the global properties of externally supplied circumbinary disks depend on the binary <b>accretion</b> rate. <b>By</b> formulating our results {{in terms of the}} angular momentum flux driven by internal stresses, we come up with a very simple classification of the possible global disk structures, which differ from the standard constant Ṁ accretion disk solution. Suppression of <b>accretion</b> <b>by</b> the binary tides, leading to a significant mass accumulation in the inner disk, accelerates binary inspiral. We show that once the disk region strongly perturbed by the viscously transmitted tidal torque exceeds the binary semi-major axis, the binary can merge in less than its mass-doubling time due to accretion. Thus, unlike the inspirals driven by stellar scattering, the gas-assisted merger can occur even if the binary is embedded in a relatively low mass disk (lower than its own mass). This is important for resolving the "last parsec" problem for SMBH binaries and understanding powerful gravitational wave sources in the Universe. We argue that the enhancement of <b>accretion</b> <b>by</b> the binary found in some recent simulations cannot persist {{for a long time and}} should not affect the long-term orbital inspiral. We also review the existing simulations of the SMBH binary-disk coupling and propose a numerical setup, which is particularly well suited for verifying our theoretical predictions.
