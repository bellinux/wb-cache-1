30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the structure of}} <b>amorphous</b> <b>alloy,</b> a simple and accurate method based on quasi-equivalent cluster was proposed. The Zr 56 Al 16 Co 28 <b>amorphous</b> <b>alloy</b> is constituted of α quasi-equivalent cluster, β quasi-equivalent cluster and γ quasi-equivalent cluster, and the atomic arrangement of α quasi-equivalent cluster, β quasi-equivalent cluster, and γ quasi-equivalent cluster is similar to ZrCo phase, Zr 6 Al 2 Co phase, and ZrAlCo phase, respectively, but these clusters in <b>amorphous</b> <b>alloy</b> are disorganized. Why this method can work well with the challenge we face? This method can well explain at least the following three basic questions.
