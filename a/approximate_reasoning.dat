The objective {{of the study is}} to determine the ranking of the weapons system in a subjective environment. The proposed model based on fuzzy sets has initiated the idea of membership set score value evaluation of each criterion alternative. This enables the inclusion of requirements which are incomplete and imprecise. The <b>approximate</b> <b>reasonings</b> of the method allows the decision maker to make the best choice in accordance to human thinking and reasoning processes. The proposed model is based on fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making that consists of fuzzy rules. The use of fuzzy rules, which are extracted directly from input data in making evaluation, contributes to a better decision in selecting the best choice and is less dependent on the domain of expert. The dataset from previous research was used to validate the fuzzy evaluation model. Results from numerical examples are comparable to other fuzzy evaluation approaches. Copyright © 200...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{concept of}} the truth degree of a formula is the crucial tool and the {{building}} block in quantitative logic, from which the concept of logic metric in quantitative logic is derived. Logic metric takes {{an important role in}} quantitative logic, related to which are other concepts in quantitative logic such as divergence, consistency, etc. In the present paper, having combined the theory of generalized tautologies with the theory of truth degrees in quantitative logic, we have proposed the theory of ΣΓ-truth degrees of formulas related to theory Γ in the logic system Ln∗ (n-valued NM-logic system), and discussed some of its properties. With the help of the properties of ΣΓ-truth degrees: τΓ(A) +τΓ(A→B) ≤ 1 +τΓ(B), we have obtained the Γ-logic metric on the set F(S) of formulas in the propositional logic system Ln∗ (n-valued NM-logic system).

40|$|Based on {{the truth}} degree of the formula, {{conditional}} truth degree and the implicative truth degree respectively, we gain the new numerical studying method of {{the severity of}} the systems and the <b>approximate</b> <b>reasoning</b> problems in the two-valued propositionallogic. Furthermore, we also concentrate on the relationship among the truth degree, conditional truth degree and the implicative truth degree in <b>approximate</b> <b>reasoning</b> mode. According to the truth degree in this paper, we obtain the definition of the implication measure-ment in the two-valued propositional logic system. Using the truth degree expressions of the implication measurement, we show the implication measurement expressions of the pseudo mertic which are resulted separately from the truth degree, conditional truth degree and implicative truth degree. These expressions are all relative to the finite theory. Hence we have achieved the transformation from the problems of <b>approximate</b> <b>reasoning</b> based on the tree kind of truth degrees as above to the <b>approximate</b> <b>reasoning</b> based on the implication measurement.

However, the next generation of expert systems should have an environment which contain a choice of several mathematical algorithms for <b>approximate</b> <b>reasoning.</b> To meet the need for validatable and verifiable coding, the expert system environment must no longer depend upon ad hoc reasoning techniques but instead must include mathematically rigorous techniques for <b>approximate</b> <b>reasoning.</b> Popular <b>approximate</b> <b>reasoning</b> techniques are reviewed, including: certainty factors, belief measures, Bayesian probabilities, fuzzy logic, and Shafer-Dempster techniques for reasoning. A group of mathematically rigorous algorithms for <b>approximate</b> <b>reasoning</b> are focused on that could form the basis of a next generation expert system environment. These algorithms are based upon the axioms of set theory and probability theory. To separate these algorithms for <b>approximate</b> <b>reasoning</b> various conditions of mutual exclusivity and independence are imposed upon the assertions. <b>Approximate</b> <b>reasoning</b> algorithms presented include: reasoning with statistically independent assertions, reasoning with mutually exclusive assertions, reasoning with assertions that exhibit minimum overlay within the state space, reasoning with assertions that exhibit maximum overlay within the state space (i. e. fuzzy logic), pessimistic reasoning (i. e. worst case analysis), optimistic reasoning (i. e. best case analysis), and reasoning with assertions with absolutely no knowledge of the possible dependency among the assertions. A robust environment for expert system construction should include the two modes of inference: modus ponens and modus tollens. Modus ponens inference is based upon reasoning towards the conclusion in a statement of logical implication, whereas modus tollens inference is based upon reasoning away from the conclusion.
