5|$|With the US Army {{forces in}} Europe seeing {{drawdowns}} and redeployments, {{it was announced}} that V Corps would be eliminated, and the 130th Engineer Brigade would be moved elsewhere. The brigade formally left Hanau with <b>a</b> <b>Casing</b> of the Colors ceremony at Pioneer Kaserne on 4 May 2007. Casing the unit's colors was a tradition formally signifying its inactivation and, for all official purposes, the brigade had ceased to be an active Army unit. The brigade headquarters became part of U.S. Army Pacific on 16 June 2007.|$|E
5|$|On 13 March 1943, in {{preparation}} for the Battle of Kursk, Hitler visited the Eastern Front at Smolensk. Originally the plan was for certain officers to shoot Hitler collectively at a signal given in the officers' mess during lunch. However, that plan was cast aside. Instead a second plan devised by General Henning von Tresckow's Nazi resistance group was carried out. Upon leaving, staff officer Heinz Brandt, who was traveling in Hitler's entourage, agreed to take a box containing two bottles of cognac to Colonel Helmuth Stieff who was stationed at Hitler's headquarters. The package was given to Brandt by Tresckow. The cognac bottles were actually a bomb placed into <b>a</b> <b>casing,</b> with a timer fuse. The plane took off with both Hitler and Brandt on board, but it arrived safely at the Wolf's Lair field headquarters in East Prussia. The bomb most likely failed to detonate because the extremely low temperatures in the unheated luggage compartment of the plane prevented the fuse from operating properly.|$|E
5000|$|A {{compound}} turbine is a {{steam turbine}} {{in which there}} are two <b>casings,</b> <b>a</b> high-pressure <b>casing</b> and <b>a</b> low-pressure <b>casing,</b> operating in concert to extract work from a single source of steam. The steam is partially expanded in the high-pressure casing, then exhausted to the low-pressure casing.|$|R
40|$|Efficiency of a {{centrifugal}} pump {{is known to}} drop rapidly with a decrease of specific speed n_s {{in the range of}} n_s≤ 100. However, below n_s= 60 [m, m^ 3 /min, min^], the pump efficiency is not yet clear, and the spiral angle of volute casing becomes too small to manufacture. To solve this problem, <b>a</b> circular <b>casing</b> is considered appropriate in the very low n_s range. The present study is aimed to reveal the relation between pump efficiency and a specific speed in the range of n_s≤ 60, when <b>a</b> circular <b>casing</b> is used. The results show that <b>a</b> circular <b>casing</b> gives higher efficiency than <b>a</b> spiral <b>casing,</b> and that radial thrust is considerably small in both casings compared with that of ordinary specific speed pump...|$|R

25|$|Fish-skin boots (amirak ~ amiraq sg amiriik dual in Yup'ik and Cup'ik) are {{waterproof}} skin boot made of fish skin. In {{the past}} fish-skin boots {{were made with}} depilated soles of bearded seal, ankle straps, and <b>a</b> <b>casing</b> sewb to the upper edge of the leg. Large salmon skins were prepared for boots by sewing up the fin holes. A round needle was used because a triangular needle would split the skin.|$|E
25|$|Dog ear is <b>a</b> <b>casing</b> type with {{extensions}} at {{both sides}} of pickup. These are extensions of the predominantly rectangular cover, that encompass the outlying mounting screws. Dog-ear P-90 pickups were commonly mounted on Gibson's hollow-body guitars like the ES-330 and occasionally on solid-body models like the Les Paul Junior. The same pickups were also available on Epiphone models (since Gibson was building Epiphone guitars in the 1950s) and the design is best remembered for its appearance on the hollow body Epiphone Casino of {{the mid to late}} 1960s.|$|E

25|$|The {{good state}} of {{preservation}} of these buildings and their frescoes was due to their location, close to the main city wall facing west, and the military necessity to strengthen the wall. The Sassanid Persians had become adept at tunneling under such walls in order to undermine them and create breaches. As a countermeasure the Roman garrison decided to sacrifice {{the street and the}} buildings along the wall by filling them with rubble to bolster the wall in case of a Persian mining operation, so the Christian chapel, the synagogue, the Mithraeum and many other buildings were entombed. They also buttressed the walls from the outside with an earthen mound forming a glacis and sealed it with <b>a</b> <b>casing</b> of mud brick to prevent erosion.|$|E
25|$|The 4th Infantry Division's Support Brigade held <b>a</b> <b>Casing</b> of the Colors {{ceremony}} for the brigade and Support Battalion colors during retreat at Cameron Field on 8 September 2005. The event signified the unit's deployment to Iraq {{in support of}} Operation Iraqi Freedom. The 470 soldiers of the Support Brigade were the first personnel from the division to deploy to Iraq. They left in late September 2005. The brigade made two stops {{along the way to}} Camp Taji, one at Camp Buehring, Kuwait, and the other at Camp Anaconda, Iraq. Soldiers trained for two weeks at Camp Beuhring. The training went from basic firing skills like confirming their zero to more quick individual training at the close-quarters marksmanship course and reacting to a suspicious vehicle at an entry control point. The soldiers' training reached its peak with live-fire convoy exercises, where soldiers moved vehicles into defensive and offensive positions, moved disabled vehicles and requested medical evacuations for injured personnel.|$|E

500|$|During operation, fully {{cooked meat}} or cheese logs arrive sealed in {{impermeable}} casings. [...] The logs go through <b>a</b> <b>casing</b> sanitation step that involves being {{treated with a}} sanitizing liquid before the casings are removed from the logs. [...] The logs then undergo a postlethality treatment by passing through an infrared pasteurization tunnel to kill pathogens on the logs. [...] The logs are then mechanically transferred to slicers, sliced, and placed in sealed packages that are transferred out of the processing cell.

500|$|The fertilised egg matures and hatches {{to give a}} {{caterpillar}}. The caterpillar is {{the feeding}} stage of the lepidopteran life cycle. The caterpillar {{needs to be able}} to feed and to avoid being eaten and much of its morphology has evolved to facilitate these two functions. After growth and ecdysis, the caterpillar enters into a [...] developmental stage called a pupa (or chrysalis) around which it may form <b>a</b> <b>casing.</b> The insect develops into the adult in the pupa stage; when ready the pupa hatches and the adult stage or imago of a butterfly or moth arises.|$|E
500|$|A cocoon is <b>a</b> <b>casing</b> spun of silk by many moth caterpillars, and {{numerous}} other holometabolous insect larvae as a protective covering for the pupa. Most Lepidoptera larvae will either make a cocoon and pupate inside them or will pupate in a cell under the ground, {{with the exception of}} butterflies and advanced moths such as noctuids, whose pupae are exposed. The pupae of moths are usually brown and smooth whereas butterfly pupae are often colourful and their shape varies greatly. In butterflies, the exposed pupa {{is often referred to as}} a chrysalis, derived from the Greek term [...] "chrysalis": [...] (...) for gold, referring to the golden colour of some pupae.|$|E

500|$|The initial design had two islands {{with the}} flight deck running between them. Each island {{contained}} one funnel; a large net could be strung between them to stop out-of-control aircraft. The islands were connected by braces and the bridge was mounted {{on top of the}} bracing, which left a clear height of [...] for the aircraft on {{the flight deck}}. Fairly early in the design process, {{the decision was made to}} delete the funnels to reduce turbulence over the flight deck. The exhaust gases were, instead, ducted aft in the space between the roof of the hangar deck and the flight deck and were enclosed by <b>a</b> <b>casing</b> through which cooler air was driven by electric fans. They normally exhausted underneath the aft end of the flight deck, but the exhaust could be vented through openings on the rear side of the hull by two large electric fans.|$|E
500|$|The Grenade, Hand, Anti-Tank No. 74 {{consisted}} of a glass sphere in which was contained approximately [...] of semi-liquid nitroglycerin devised by ICI. The sphere was covered in stockinette which was coated with a liberal amount of birdlime, an extremely adhesive substance from which the nickname 'sticky bomb' was derived. <b>A</b> <b>casing</b> made out of thin sheet-metal, and formed of two halves, was then placed around the sphere and {{held in place by}} a wooden handle, inside which was a five-second fuse. The handle also contained two pins and a lever; the first pin was pulled out to make the casing fall away, and the second to activate the firing mechanism in the grenade. This primed the grenade, with the lever being held down to ensure the fuse was not triggered; then the user would run up to the tank and stick the grenade to its hull, using as much force as possible to break the sphere and spread the nitroglycerin onto the hull in a thick paste. Another alternative was for the user to throw it at the tank from a distance. Either way, the lever would be released and the fuse activated, and the grenade would then detonate.|$|E
