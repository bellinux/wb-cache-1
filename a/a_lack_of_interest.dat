5|$|After playing AAA midget {{with the}} Strathmore Bisons of the Foothills Bisons Hockey Association, Raymond began a two-year Junior A {{career with the}} Camrose Kodiaks of the AJHL in 2003–04. Raymond had been {{hesitant}} about pursuing his career due to <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> from major junior teams, but his friend Dan Bertram encouraged him to play with him in Camrose. Bertram also played midget with Raymond {{and went on to}} be a Chicago Blackhawks draft pick, three selections after him.|$|E
5|$|Another American {{tradition}} {{is that of}} an apolitical military, although this custom was of more recent origin, dating back only to the period after the American Civil War. Few officers voted in the 19th century, {{but not so much}} from <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in politics as because frequently moving from state to state and living on Federal land effectively disenfranchised them under the laws of many states. Under General of the Army William T. Sherman, the Commanding General of the United States Army from 1869 to 1883, who hated politics, this custom of an apolitical military became firmly established.|$|E

5|$|Gimmick! {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} and <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> at release. Distributors {{were more interested}} in games for the new 16-bit systems, so Sakai found difficulty in getting the game localized outside Japan. Sunsoft of America did not approve of the game for a North American release due to its quirky character design. Ultimately, the only distributor that imported the game was Swedish distributor Bergsala, which released it in 1993 in small quantities across the Scandinavian market. Critics both praised and criticized the game for its challenging difficulty, and some thought the game was designed exclusively for children due to its character design. In retrospective reviews, Gimmick! has received more praise, even seeing a re-release in Japan in 2002 for the PlayStation.|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, O~3 Entertainment {{announced}} that it would be localizing Radirgy in February for North America exclusively for the GameCube under the new title of Radio Allergy. The company had previously localized MileStone's other shooter, Chaos Field. However, the release date was pushed back several times, and was eventually cancelled by June 2007 due to <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> from retailers in stocking GameCube titles. MileStone began looking into options to include the game in a compilation for the Wii. Radio Allergy was finally localized for the Wii in the Ultimate Shooting Collection compilation along with Chaos Field and Karous. A sequel, Radirgy Noa, was released in 2009. Another title, Radirgy De Gojaru, was released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2014 in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{designer}} Peter James described Flight Unlimited IIIs {{development as}} a struggle, thanks to <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> from Electronic Arts and from Looking Glass's management. Placed in direct competition with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 and Fly!, the game failed to capture sufficient market share. It became one of Looking Glass's biggest commercial flops, with roughly 20,000 units sold in the United States during 1999. This contributed to the company's closure in 2000. The game was well received by critics, who praised its terrain rendering and dynamic weather. Its simulated physics were lauded by several reviewers, but others felt that the physics were imprecise, and that the game's system requirements were extremely high.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{recession}} of the 1990s, downtown Albany was home to four Fortune 500 companies. After the death of Corning and the retirement of Congressman Sam Stratton, the political environment changes. Long-term office holders became rare in the 1980s. Local media began following the drama surrounding county politics (specifically that of the newly created county executive position); the loss of Corning (and eventually the machine) led to <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in city politics. The election of Gerald Jennings was a surprise, and he served as Mayor from 1994 until his retirement {{at the end of}} 2013. His tenure essentially ended the political machine that had been in place since the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Army {{had entered}} the Second World War with {{inadequate}} resources due to severe cutbacks {{at the hands of}} conservative governments in the 1920s and 1930s. This was compounded by <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> and appreciation of logistics on the part of its civilian and military leadership. There was an assumption that the Australian Army would form part of an expeditionary force that would fight overseas in a larger British force. This was indeed the case in the Great War, and again in the Second World War in the Middle East and Malaya, but not in SWPA, where the Australian Army not only had to provide its own logistic support, but support to its Allies as well.|$|E
5|$|The current Washington Park Lake House {{was built}} in 1929 {{replacing}} the original stick style structure constructed in 1876. It is constructed in the Spanish Revival style with terracotta, terrazzo, brick, and guastavino tile. The area {{in front of the}} lake house has been the site for the performance of plays by the Park Playhouse for over 20 years. A 900-seat amphitheater faces the lake house allowing for comfortable seating for the over 60,000 people who visit every year. A proposal by the city to turn the lake house into a 125-seat restaurant and 200-seat banquet hall with an expanded dock with boat, cross-country ski, and ice skate rentals failed to materialize due to <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> from the private business sector.|$|E

5|$|A general {{perception}} on Narayan {{was that}} he did not involve himself or his writings with the politics or problems of India, as mentioned by V. S. Naipaul in one of his columns. However, according to Wyatt Mason of The New Yorker, although Narayan's writings seem simple and display <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in politics, he delivers his narrative with an artful and deceptive technique when dealing with such subjects and does not entirely avoid them, rather letting the words play in the reader's mind. Srinivasa Iyengar, former vice-chancellor of Andhra University, says that Narayan wrote about political topics only in the context of his subjects, quite unlike his compatriot Mulk Raj Anand who dealt with the political structures and problems of the time. Paul Brians, in his book Modern South Asian Literature in English, says that the fact that Narayan completely ignored British rule and focused on the private lives of his characters is a political statement on its own, declaring his independence from the influence of colonialism.|$|E
5|$|At a {{congress}} in 1897 in Halle, the localists founded {{a national organization}} of their own, the Representatives' Centralization of Germany (Vertrauensmänner-Zentralisation Deutschlands). The congress was originally supposed to take place a year earlier, but <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> forced it to be postponed. There were 37 delegates at the congress representing 6,803 union members. Nearly two-thirds of the delegates came from Berlin or Halle. Almost half the delegates worked in the construction industry, while 14 delegates came from highly specialized professions. The congress decided to establish a five-person Business Commission seated in Berlin to organize political actions, aid in communication between local organizations, and raise financial support for strikes. Fritz Kater became {{the chairman of the}} commission. A newspaper, Solidarität (Solidarity), was founded, but the name was changed to Die Einigkeit (Unity) the following year. It initially appeared fortnightly, but was published on a weekly basis beginning in 1898.|$|E
5|$|Coolidge {{has often}} been criticized for his actions during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the worst natural {{disaster}} to hit the Gulf Coast until Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Although he did eventually name Secretary Hoover to a commission in charge of flood relief, scholars argue that Coolidge overall showed <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in federal flood control. Coolidge {{did not believe that}} personally visiting the region after the floods would accomplish anything, {{and that it would be}} seen as mere political grandstanding. He also did not want to incur the federal spending that flood control would require; he believed property owners should bear much of the cost. On the other hand, Congress wanted a bill that would place the federal government completely in charge of flood mitigation. When Congress passed a compromise measure in 1928, Coolidge declined to take credit for it and signed the bill in private on May 15.|$|E

5|$|The Kingdom of This World is {{considered}} to be Alejo Carpentier's first great novel. He is praised for his skillful inclusion of Haitian voodoo, myth, and history in the work, as well as for contributing to the definition of Latin American identity. Although the presence of magic realism in The Kingdom of This World has been acclaimed by critics and discussed at length within the academic community, this concern is paralleled by <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in Carpentier's technical work in the novel. In particular, his vision of time has been widely ignored. The Kingdom of This World has also been criticized for its narrative organization, which predominantly relies on opposition rather than on succession: the novel does not present history in terms of a sequence of events and their consequences. The gaps within chronological time that occur throughout this novel as well as the sudden changes of perspective and minimal transitional narrative have led some to criticize the book for the chaotic first impression it gives the reader.|$|E
