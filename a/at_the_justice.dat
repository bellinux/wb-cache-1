Instead, he helped pick the team and supervised it from Washington, where he was involved in major decisions, including the choice to seek the death penalty for McVeigh and Nichols.

25|$|In 1526 John Stewart, 3rd Earl of Lennox {{fortified}} Dumbarton {{against the}} Douglas faction who had {{control of the}} young James V, but his forces were defeated by Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus {{at the battle of}} Linlithgow Bridge. James Hamilton of Finnart, who was implicated in the death of the Earl of Lennox, was given custody of the castle till 1531. Later in his personal reign James V used the castle as a prison for those convicted <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>justice</b> ayre, receiving their fines and composition payments in 1539. In 1540 James circumnavigated Scotland from the Forth and arrived at Dumbarton with Cardinal Beaton, the Earl of Huntly, and the Earl of Arran each leading a force of five hundred men. This expedition was later published by Nicolas de Nicolay Seigneur d'Arfeville, cosmographer to the King of France in 1583, with the first modern map of Scotland's coastline.|$|E

500|$|Most of {{the scandals}} that have marred the {{reputation}} of Harding's administration did not emerge until after his death. The Veterans' Bureau scandal was known to Harding in January 1923 but, according to Trani and Wilson, [...] "the president's handling of it did him little credit". Harding allowed the corrupt director of the bureau, Charles R. Forbes, to flee to Europe, though he later returned and served prison time. Harding had learned that Daugherty's factotum <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> Department, Jess Smith, was involved in corruption. The president ordered Daugherty to get Smith out of Washington and removed his name from the upcoming presidential trip to Alaska. Smith committed suicide on May 30, 1923. It is uncertain how much Harding knew about Smith's illicit activities. Murray noted that Harding {{was not involved in}} the corruption and did not condone it.|$|E

His wife, whom he had most likely met before 1916, while attending Miller Verghy's soirées, was his senior by 25 years.
