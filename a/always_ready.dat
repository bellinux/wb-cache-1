5|$|It is an energetic, free-spirited breed. Even {{though it}} is a gundog, it is also kept as a {{companion}} dog because of its easy-going nature and devotion to the cause. It is a cheerful, active dog and is <b>always</b> <b>ready</b> to play, responding to any form of attention with a happily wagging tail. Russian Spaniels are trainable, can make a good watchdog, and are amiable with children.|$|E
5|$|Perry Como {{never forgot}} Canonsburg either. One {{of the things}} he did to give a helping hand to his home town was to {{convince}} RCA to open a record-pressing plant there. Those who needed to raise funds for local projects like Boys' and Girls' Clubs found him <b>always</b> <b>ready</b> to do whatever was needed.|$|E
5|$|Active and cheerful, the Russian Toy was {{originally}} bred {{both as an}} anti-rat dog and a watch dog. The second quality is still active in the breed, {{and they can be}} very vocal. They can become quite attached to their family, regardless of the ages of the family members. Russian Toys are usually very reserved with strangers, but very loyal to their owners, <b>always</b> <b>ready</b> to protect them from any perceived danger.|$|E

5|$|The Rashtrakuta army {{consisted}} of large contingents of infantry, horsemen, and elephants. A standing army was <b>always</b> <b>ready</b> for {{war in a}} cantonment (Sthirabhuta Kataka) in the regal capital of Manyakheta. Large armies were also maintained by the feudatory kings who were expected {{to contribute to the}} defense of the empire in case of war. Chieftains and all the officials also served as commanders whose postings were transferable if the need arose.|$|E
5|$|Sarah's frankness and {{indifference}} for rank, so admired by Anne earlier in their friendship, was now {{seen to be}} intrusive. Unlike most women of the time—many of whom did not have influence with their own husbands—Sarah had a powerful intimacy with the two most powerful men in the country, Marlborough and Godolphin. Godolphin, though a great friend of Sarah's, had even considered refusing high office after Anne's accession, preferring to live quietly {{and away from the}} political side of Sarah, who was bossy, interfering, and presumed to tell him what to do when Marlborough was away. Sarah, although a woman in a man's world of national and international politics, was <b>always</b> <b>ready</b> to give her advice; express her opinions; antagonize with outspoken censure; and insist on having her say on every possible occasion. However, she had a charm and vivaciousness which was admired by many; and she could easily delight those she met with her wit.|$|E
5|$|The armies {{remained}} in their encampments {{for the campaign}} season while men and horses ate all the provisions and forage for miles. Prince Henry wrote to his brother, suggesting they complete their operations by 22 August, at which time he estimated he would have exhausted local supplies of food for his men and fodder for his horses. Frederick agreed. He laid plans to cross the Elbe and approach the Austrian force from the rear, but the more he examined the conditions of Joseph's entrenchments, the more he realized the campaign was already lost. Even if he and Henry executed simultaneous attacks on the Königgrätz heights, such a plan exposed Henry to a flanking attack from Laudon. A coordinated frontal and rear assault was also unlikely to succeed. Even if it did, the Prussian losses would be unacceptable and would demolish his army's capacity to resist other invaders. From Frederick's perspective, the Russians and the Swedes were <b>always</b> <b>ready</b> {{to take advantage of}} any perceived Prussian weakness, and the French also could not be trusted to keep their distance. For Frederick, it was a risk not worth taking. Despite this realization, the four armies—two Austrian, two Prussian—{{remained in}} place until September, eating as much of the country's resources as they could.|$|E

25|$|Rama {{had three}} brothers, {{according}} to the Balakhanda section of the Ramayana. These were Lakshmana, Bharata and Shatrughna. The extant manuscripts of the text describes their education and training as young princes, but this is brief. Rama is portrayed as a polite, self-controlled, virtuous youth <b>always</b> <b>ready</b> to help others. His education included the Vedas, the Vedangas {{as well as the}} martial arts.|$|E

25|$|The many anecdotes about Democritus, {{especially}} in Diogenes Laërtius, attest to his disinterest, modesty, and simplicity, {{and show that}} he lived exclusively for his studies. One story has him deliberately blinding himself {{in order to be}} less disturbed in his pursuits; it may well be true that he lost his sight in old age. He was cheerful, and was <b>always</b> <b>ready</b> to see the comical side of life, which later writers took to mean that he always laughed at the foolishness of people.|$|E
25|$|<b>Always</b> <b>ready</b> to {{give advice}} to his comrades, Yashin even made a fourth {{trip to the}} World Cup finals in 1970, held in Mexico, as the third-choice back-up and an {{assistant}} coach. The Soviet team again reached the quarter-finals. In 1971, in Moscow, he played his last match for Dynamo Moscow. Lev Yashin’s FIFA testimonial match {{was held at the}} Lenin Stadium in Moscow with 100,000 fans attending and a host of football stars, including Pelé, Eusébio and Franz Beckenbauer.|$|E
25|$|After his {{retirement}} from professional cricket Evans ran the Jolly Drover pub at Hill Brow, Hampshire, {{then on the}} main A3 road, sporting the muttonchop whiskers he had admired in his grandfather. He published two memoirs: Behind the stumps (1951) and The gloves are off (1960). The pub was adorned with cricketing photographs and Evans was <b>always</b> <b>ready</b> to reminisce about his cricketing days. He became a cricket expert for bookmakers Ladbrokes, famously offering odds of 500 to 1 on an England victory against Australia at Headingley in 1981, the match in which Ian Botham and Bob Willis fought back from following-on at 227 runs behind to achieve an improbable victory.|$|E

25|$|It did {{not matter}} that the vehicle was lightly armoured, because the {{soldiers}} it was expected to meet would be lightly equipped; what was of key importance was that the vehicle would survive the bombardment that was expected to immediately precede a landing. Armadillos were to be kept {{a short distance from}} the airfield, well hidden and protected but <b>always</b> <b>ready</b> to be called into action. Overweight, the Armadillo was unsuitable for travelling over rough or boggy ground. However, it did not need to travel far or fast, nor did it need to cope with hills; it could easily move along airfield taxiways and perimeter roads.|$|E
25|$|Scrooge never {{completed}} a formal education, {{as he left}} school at an early age. However, he has a sharp mind and is <b>always</b> <b>ready</b> to learn new skills. Because of his secondary occupation as a treasure hunter, Scrooge {{has become something of}} a scholar and an amateur archaeologist. Starting with Barks, several writers have explained how Scrooge becomes aware of the treasures he decides to pursue. This often involves periods of research consulting various written sources in search of passages that might lead him to a treasure. Often Scrooge decides to search for the possible truth behind old legends, or discovers obscure references to the activities of ancient conquerors, explorers and military leaders that he considers interesting enough to begin a new expedition.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{fighting}} concluded in August 1919, its effects {{continued to be}} felt in the region for some time afterwards. The nationalism and disruption that it had sparked stirred up more unrest {{in the years to}} come, particularly in Waziristan. The tribesmen, <b>always</b> <b>ready</b> to exploit governmental weakness, whether real or perceived, banded together in the common cause of disorder and unrest. They had become well-armed {{as a result of the}} conflict, whence they benefitted greatly from the weapons and ammunition that the Afghans had left behind and from an influx of manpower in large numbers of deserters from the militia that had joined their ranks. With these additions they launched a campaign of resistance against British authority on the North-West Frontier that was to last until the end of the Raj.|$|E

25|$|In January 1899 {{he went to}} Siam {{and wrote}} {{that there was no}} need for French {{interference}} in that country, which was quite capable of governing itself. Later in the year he went to England, and early in 1900 paid a short visit to his relations in Australia. Returning to the east by way of Japan he then visited Korea before returning to Peking. The Boxer Uprising broke out soon after, and during the siege of the legations from June to August Morrison as an acting-lieutenant showed great courage, <b>always</b> <b>ready</b> to volunteer for every service of danger. He was superficially wounded in July but was erroneously reported as killed. He was afterwards able to read his highly laudatory obituary notice, which occupied two columns of The Times on 17 July 1900. After a siege of 55 days, the legations were relieved on 14 August 1900 by an army of various nationalities under General Alfred Gaselee. The army then ransacked much of the palaces in Peking, with Morrison taking part in the looting, making off with silks, furs, porcelain and bronzes.|$|E
25|$|The {{rise of the}} {{minstrel}} show {{coincided with}} the growth of the abolitionist movement. Many Northerners were concerned for the oppressed blacks of the South, but most had no idea how these slaves lived day-to-day. Blackface performance had been inconsistent on this subject; some slaves were happy, others victims of a cruel and inhuman institution. However, in the 1850s minstrelsy became decidedly mean-spirited and pro-slavery as race replaced class as its main focus. Most minstrels projected a greatly romanticized and exaggerated image of black life with cheerful, simple slaves <b>always</b> <b>ready</b> to sing and dance and to please their masters. (Less frequently, the masters cruelly split up black lovers or sexually assaulted black women.) The lyrics and dialogue were generally racist, satiric, and largely white in origin. Songs about slaves yearning to return to their masters were plentiful. The message was clear: do not worry about the slaves; they are happy with their lot in life. Figures like the Northern dandy and the homesick ex-slave reinforced the idea that blacks did not belong, nor did they want to belong, in Northern society.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{historians have}} put forward many views and {{explanations}} {{of the civil war}} era. The contemporary sources, the sagas, strongly emphasise the personal nature of the conflicts—wars arose {{as a result of the}} struggle between different people for the possession of the throne. The unclear succession laws, and the practice of power-sharing between several kings simultaneously, gave personal conflicts the potential to become full-blown wars. More recently historian Narve Bjørgo has suggested that the practice of power-sharing was actually a good way of governing the kingdom in the first period after its unification, and that tendencies towards centralization, and a unitary kingdom, were important factors in triggering the wars. Edvard Bull has also emphasized geographical animosities as a factor, pointing to the fact that different pretenders often found their main support in certain parts of the country. Also important was the involvement of foreign powers: Danish and, to a lesser extent, Swedish kings were <b>always</b> <b>ready</b> to lend their support to factions in the Norwegian wars, with an eye to extending their own influence, particularly in the Viken (Oslofjord) area.|$|E
