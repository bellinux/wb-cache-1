40|$|BACKGROUND: In 2012, the Netherlands {{experienced}} {{the most extensive}} food-related outbreak of Salmonella ever recorded. It was caused by smoked salmon contaminated with Salmonella Thompson during processing. In total, 1149 cases of salmonellosis were laboratory confirmed and reported to RIVM. Twenty percent of cases was hospitalised and four cases were reported to be fatal. The {{purpose of this study}} was to estimate total costs of the Salmonella Thompson outbreak. METHODS: Data from a case-control study were used to estimate the cost-of-illness of reported cases (i. e. healthcare costs, patient costs and production losses). Outbreak control costs were estimated based on interviews with staff from health authorities. Using the Dutch foodborne disease burden and cost-of-illness model, we estimated the number of underestimated cases and the associated cost-of-illness. RESULTS: The estimated number of cases, including reported and underestimated cases was 21 123. Adjusted for underestimation, the total cost-of-illness would be € 6. 8 million (95 % CI € 2. 5 -€ 16. 7 million) with productivity losses being the main cost driver. Adding outbreak control costs, the total outbreak costs are estimated at € 7. 5 million. CONCLUSION: In the Netherlands, measures are taken to reduce salmonella concentrations in food, but detection of contamination during food processing remains difficult. As shown, Salmonella outbreaks have the potential for a relatively high disease and economic burden for society. Early warning and close cooperation between the industry, health <b>authorities</b> <b>and</b> <b>laboratories</b> is essential for rapid detection, control of outbreaks, and to reduce disease and economic burden...|$|E
40|$|With the {{persistent}} threat of emerging infectious diseases and bioterrorism, {{it has become}} increasingly important that clinicians be able to identify the diseases that might signal the occurrence of these unusual events. Essential to a thoughtful diagnostic approach is understanding when to initiate a public health investigation and how to appropriately use commonly performed microbiology procedures in the sentinel laboratory to evaluate potential pathogens. Although diagnostic test development is evolving rapidly, recognizing many of these pathogens continues to challenge the capabilities of most sentinel laboratories. Therefore, effective, ongoing communication and education among clinicians, infection control personnel, sentinel laboratorians, public health <b>authorities,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Laboratory</b> Response Network reference laboratorians is the key to preparedness. The emergence of West Nile fever virus (1999) and the delib-erate release of anthrax (2001) in the United States were first identified by astute clinicians and laboratorians rather than by the public health surveillance systems [1, 2]. With the ongoing threat of both natural and intentional outbreaks, infectious disease specialists and primary care providers need to under-stand how to enhance the likelihood of diagnosing and con...|$|R
40|$|Background: Previous {{analyses}} of sera from {{a limited number}} of Ghanaian Buruli ulcer (BU) patients, their household contacts, individuals living in BU non-endemic regions as well as European controls have indicated that antibody responses to the M. ulcerans 18 kDa small heat shock protein (shsp) reflect exposure to this pathogen. Here, we have investigated to what extent inhabitants of regions in Ghana regarded as non-endemic for BU develop anti- 18 kDa shsp antibody titers. Methodology/Principal Findings: For this purpose we determined anti- 18 kDa shsp IgG titers in sera collected from healthy inhabitants of the BU endemic Densu River Valley and the Volta Region, which was so far regarded as BU non-endemic. Significantly more sera from the Densu River Valley contained anti- 18 kDa shsp IgG (32 % versus 12 %, respectively). However, some sera from the Volta Region also showed high titers. When interviewing these sero-responders, it was revealed that the person with the highest titer had a chronic wound, which was clinically diagnosed <b>and</b> <b>laboratory</b> reconfirmed as active BU. After identification of this BU index case, further BU cases were clinically diagnosed by the Volta Region local health <b>authorities</b> <b>and</b> <b>laboratory</b> reconfirmed. Interestingly, there was neither a difference in sero-prevalence nor in IS 2404 PCR positivity of environmental samples between BU endemic and non-endemic communities located in the Densu River Valley.

40|$|Pavement {{settlement}} {{occurring in}} and around utility cuts is a common problem, resulting in uneven pavement surfaces, annoyance to drivers, and ultimately, further maintenance. A survey of municipal <b>authorities</b> <b>and</b> field <b>and</b> <b>laboratory</b> investigations were conducted to identify the factors contributing to the settlement of utility cut restorations in pavement sections. Survey responses were received from seven cities across Iowa and indicate that utility cut restorations often last less than two years. Observations made during site inspections showed that backfill material varies from one city to another, backfill lift thickness often exceeds 12 inches, and the backfill material is often placed at bulking moisture contents with no Quality control/Quality Assurance. Laboratory investigation of the backfill materials indicate that at the field moisture contents encountered, the backfill materials have collapse potentials up to 35 %. Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) deflection data and elevation shots indicate that the maximum deflection in the pavement occurs {{in the area around}} the utility cut restoration. The FWD data indicate a zone of influence {{around the perimeter of the}} restoration extending two to three feet beyond the trench perimeter. The research team proposes moisture control, the use of 65 % relative density in a granular fill, and removing and compacting the native material near the ground surface around the trench. Test sections with geogrid reinforcement were also incorporated. The performance of inspected and proposed utility cuts needs to be monitored for at least two more years...|$|R

Several molecular assays {{have been designed to}} aid diagnostics of trichinellosis. These assays are mostly complex and expensive. The genomes of Trichinella species contain certain parasite-specific genes, which can be detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. We selected -carbonic anhydrase (-CA) gene as a target, because it is present in many parasites genomes but absent in vertebrates. We developed a novel -CA gene-based method for detection of Trichinella larvae in biological samples. We first identified a -CA protein sequence from Trichinella spiralis by bioinformatic tools using -CAs from Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. Thereafter, 16 sets of designed primers were tested to detect -CA genomic sequences from three species of Trichinella, including T. spiralis, Trichinellapseudospiralis and Trichinellanativa. Among all 16 sets of designed primers, the primer set No. 2 efficiently amplified -CA genomic sequences from T. spiralis, T. pseudospiralis and T. nativa without any false-positive amplicons from other parasite samples including Toxoplasma gondii, Toxocara cati and Parascaris equorum.

30|$|There is {{a serious}} {{misconception}} {{that needs to be}} rectified, namely that a problem has been solved as soon as it is covered by legislation. A regulation entering into force, such as REACH or the Water Framework Directive or the Stockholm Convention on POPs, does not indicate that the job has been done and that no more work will be needed. On the contrary, it marks the beginning of a period of increased demand for work: when a regulation is in place, this implies an obligation to establish the empirical basis that will make it possible to effectively implement and enforce the regulation. This means that empirical findings and data need to be generated, in-depth investigations to be carried out, and the state-of-affairs to be documented, often in considerable detail. Importantly, this goes beyond the routine work, but also includes long-term tasks such as the development of methods for sampling and data generation, methods for data interpretation, and transfer of all these methods to users in <b>authorities</b> <b>and</b> contract <b>laboratories.</b> All these elements will then form the empirical and conceptual foundations that need to be in place for a meaningful implementation of the legislation and, subsequently, its effectiveness evaluation.

The work covered all areas related to industrial wastewater management and concluded that a considerable expected growth in industrialization and government encouragement of investment in recent years may lead to increase of volume and pollution load of industrial waste. Most of industries dispose their waste in municipality sewerage system. Neither industries nor government parties concerned with waste management and environment protection know the volume and nature of daily produced industrial wastewater and whether it complies with required conditions or not and there is a complete absence of monitoring. A chemical test for produced wastewater was evident that the pollution load and waste constitutions is exceeding the permissible limits stated by laws which indicated miss control and absence of pretreatment plant for produced wastewater in most of industries prior to discharge in public sewer. This and absence of inspection may lead to damage in sewerage system and may affect efficiency of central treatment plant.
