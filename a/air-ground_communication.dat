40|$|The {{capacity}} of the current ATC system is, among other factors, limited by {{the maximum number of}} aircraft that a controller can handle in a sector. This led in the past to a decrease of sector sizes in order to increase capacity. We study in this paper the impact of small sectors on the <b>air-ground</b> radio <b>communication.</b> Small sectors require a large number of radio channels, and the sector handovers generate multiple radio calls, which are workload for both controllers and pilots. We outline in this context an initial idea to make the control sectors transparent for the aircrew. With a network of radio base stations and reduced transmission powers a cell-based end-to-end communication system can potentially be established, without changing from analogue to digital radio. The aircraft transmits on the same frequency across all sectors, and the ground network routes the voice calls to the appropriate controllers.

40|$|Measuring {{the current}} level of {{workload}} {{is one of the key}} indicators to assess the benefit of new supporting tools or new procedures for air traffic controllers. In addition, it is well-known that the current stress level depends on {{the current level}} of workload and is furthermore directly related to the current traffic capacity of air traffic control. Different workload assessment techniques are already available, but they are either subjective like the Instantaneous Self-Assessment Technique (ISA) or cannot be used in real-time during simulations like the NASA task load index (NASA-TLX). In the frame of the European 7 th framework project GAMMA, a new stress measurement prototype was developed which is based on voice recognition. This prototype uses vocal stress signals to determine the current stress level of any speaker within <b>air-ground</b> voice <b>communication</b> in air traffic control. The advantage of such a system is the availability of objective stress measurements in real-time. In order to verify this new stress measurement prototype, several high-workload ATC simulations were conducted at DLR Braunschweig in January 2017. During this simulation campaign, the prototype was used in parallel with ISA and with an assessment by a third person using a modified Cooper-Harper Scale (MCH).

25|$|The most {{difficult}} aspect of close support was <b>communication.</b> <b>Air-ground</b> liaison officers {{had been used}} since 1935, when the Luftwaffe first set up a training program for this purpose. By 1937, precise procedures {{had yet to be}} worked through for air to ground coordination. Staff officers were trained to solve operational problems, and the lack of doctrine and reluctance of the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (OKL = High Command of the Air Force) to micromanage gave Sperrle and Richthofen a free hand to devise solutions. Aircraft could not communicate with the frontline. Instead they could communicate via radio with each other and their home base. One of the first innovations was to prepare signals staff on the frontline in the region of any planned air strikes, and equip them with telephones. The forward officers could telephone the base with updates, who in turn could radio the aircraft. It became an important standard operational practice. Liaison officers were attached to the Nationalist Army, and improved coordination continued {{in the second half of}} 1937 despite occasional friendly-fire incidents. In the Second World War, the Luftwaffe air units and liaison officers at the front could communicate directly with updated radios.|$|R

Secondly, a finite impulse response (FIR) model is used to approximate the overall characteristic of filters, and then the waveform of DPP can be acquired by the original waveform of PP and the FIR model. Finally, sparse representation is used to estimate the position and amplitude of each DPP, and then reconstruct each DPP. The reconstructed DPPs will be subtracted from the contaminated signal to mitigate interference.

30|$|Based on the defined UAV density, the {{required}} bandwidth for CNPC links is 90 MHz divided into 34 MHz for the terrestrial-based LOS CNPC links and 56 MHz for the BLOS CNPC links [44]. Two frequency spectrum ranges were {{assigned by the}} 2012 International Telecommunications Union World Radio Communications Conference (WRC- 12) {{to be used by}} CNPC to provide reliable and real-time data transmissions. These frequency spectrums are from 960 MHz to 1164 MHz (L-Band) and from 5030 MHz to 5091 MHz. However, a portion of the first range will be shared with other legacy applications for surveillance and navigation purposes. Another issue of CNPC links is the high security requirements. Good security mechanisms should be used on CNPC links to avoid any possibility of spoofed control or navigation signals that may allow unauthorized persons to control the UAVs [46]. For meeting future communication capacity requirements in aeronautical communications, a new <b>air-ground</b> <b>communication</b> system, called L-Band Digital Aeronautical Communication System (L-DACS), is being developed in Europe with funding from EUROCONTROL. L-DACS is the system in the Future Communication System (FCS) for L-band, 960 - 1164 MHz. L-DACS comprises of L-DACS 1 [47] and L-DACS 2 [48]. L-DACS 1 is multi-carrier broadband Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM)-based system while L-DACS 2 is narrow band single-carrier with Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK) modulation system.

40|$|The {{most recent}} {{studies by the}} Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the {{aviation}} industry have indicated {{that it has become}} increasingly difficult to make new VHF frequency or channel assignments to meet the aviation needs for air-ground communications. FAA has planned for several aggressive improvement measures to the existing systems, but these measures would not meet the projected voice communications needs beyond 2009. FAA found that since 1974 there has been, on the average, a 4 percent annual {{increase in the number of}} channel assignments needed to satisfy the <b>air-ground</b> <b>communication</b> traffic (approximately 300 new channel assignments per year). With the planned improvement measures, the channel assignments are expected to reach a maximum number of 16615 channels by about 2010. Hence, the FAA proposed the use of VDL Mode 3 as a new integrated digital voice and data communications systems to meet the future air traffic demand. This paper presents analytical results of frequency reuse; cell separation and capacity estimation of VDL Mode 3 TDMA systems that FAA has planned to implement the future VHF air-ground communications system by the year 2010. For TDMA, it is well understood that the frequency reuse factor is a crucial parameter for capacity estimation. Formulation of this frequency reuse factor is shown, taking into account the limitation imposed by the requirement to have a sufficient Signal to Co-Channel Interference Ratio. Several different values for the Signal to Co-Channel Interference Ratio were utilized corresponding to the current analog VHF DSB-AM systems, and the future digital VDL Mode 3. The required separation of Co-Channel cells is computed for most of the Frequency Protected Service Volumes (FPSV's) currently in use by the FAA. Additionally, the ideal cell capacity for each FPSV is presented. Also, using actual traffic for the Detroit air space, a FPSV traffic distribution model is used to generate a typical cell for channel capacity prediction. Such prediction is useful for evaluating the improvement of future VDL Mode 3 deployment and capacity planning...|$|E
40|$|The {{aeronautical}} {{communication infrastructure}} is currently undergoing a reorganization process. First, the analogue {{voice communication system}} in the VHF band will soon reach its capacity limit. Second, communication needs shift from pure voice towards data transmission. These issues motivate for developing new digital aeronautical communication systems. The future <b>air-ground</b> <b>communication</b> system will be operating in {{the lower part of}} the L band from 960 1164 MHz which has been assigned to the aeronautical mobile (route) service (AM(R) S) on a secondary basis at the world radio communication conference (WRC) in 2007. Currently, two candidates for the future L-band digital aeronautical communications system (LDACS) are under consideration. The first candidate termed LDACS 1 is a broadband system employing orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) as modulation scheme and separating forward and reverse link by frequency-division duplex (FDD). The second candidate, LDACS 2, is a narrowband single-carrier system utilizing time-division duplex (TDD). In this paper, we will focus on LDACS 1. A crucial issue when deciding for one of the two candidate systems is to guarantee the co-existence between LDACS and legacy systems already operating in the L band. That is a challenging task since the spectra of the legacy systems and LDACS 1 are partially overlapping. This is due to the fact that LDACS 1 is designed to be able to operate as an inlay system in the spectral gaps between the legacy systems, for achieving a high transmission capacity. An L-band compatibility study is required for proving proper coexistence. First investigations of both the interference from LDACS 1 onto legacy systems and the influence from legacy systems onto LDACS 1 have already been presented. In former publications, a theoretical analysis identified the distance measuring equipment (DME) as the most severe source of interference, LDACS 1 has to cope with. However, only one worst case and one typical scenario were considered. In contrast, in this paper we will analyze the influence of the actual DME interference situation in Europe onto LDACS 1. For assessing the influence of DME signals onto LDACS 1, we first describe the basic system parameters of LDACS 1, where special focus is put on the physical layer, since the physical received signal is directly affected by DME signals. Next, the DME system and the DME signal shape are described. This enables us to illustrate the DME influence onto LDACS 1 when employing it as inlay system. We also present interference mitigation techniques, such as pulse blanking and also pulse blanking compensation, which can be applied to reduce the detrimental influence of interference. In particular, we are interested how the DME influence onto LDACS 1 changes when these techniques are applied. For analyzing the realistic DME situation, we have implemented a European interference map, based on the current DME locations and channel allocations. This enables us to assess the particular interference situation for each aircraft position and each chosen LDACS 1 forward link carrier frequency. The interference situation is given in terms of the number of visible DME ground stations in the adjacent DME channels, the DME received power at the aircraft receiver, and the DME ground station duty cycles. In the final paper, we will present results of physical layer simulations where we derived bit-error and packet-error rates. The simulation parameters are chosen according to the interference map. The simulation will illustrate the beneficial influence of interference mitigation on the one hand. On the other hand, we are able to identify heavily disturbed areas for certain LDACS 1 forward link frequencies and assess if LDACS 1 is capable of handling this interference without applying frequency planning. Frequency planning for reducing the DME interference towards LDACS 1 is subject to further research. ...|$|E
