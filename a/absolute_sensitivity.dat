40|$|KEY WORDS arthropod; audition; neuroethology; primary {{auditory}} afferents; receptor neuro-physiology ABSTRACT This review {{presents an}} overview of the physiology of primary receptors serving tympanal hearing in insects. Auditory receptor responses vary with frequency, intensity, and temporal characteristics of sound stimuli. Various insect species exploit each of these parameters to differing degrees in the neural coding of auditory information, depending {{on the nature of the}} relevant stimuli. Frequency analysis depends on selective tuning in individual auditory receptors. In those insect groups that have individually tuned receptors, differences in physiology are corre-lated with structural differences among receptors and with the anatomical arrangement of recep-tors within the ear. Intensity coding is through the rate-level characteristics of tonically active auditory receptors and through variation in the <b>absolute</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of individual receptors (range fractionation). Temporal features of acoustic stimuli may be copied directly in the timing of afferent responses. Salient signal characteristics may also be represented by variation in the timing of afferent responses on a finer temporal scale, or by the synchrony of responses across a populatio...|$|R
40|$|Recent grism {{observations}} {{using the}} NICMOS instrument on HST have extended the spectrophotometric wavelength {{coverage of a}} subset of 16 STIS standard stars to ~ 2 µm. These observations include the three primary WD standards {{that are used to}} establish the <b>absolute</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of the three grism modes. However in their overlap region at 0. 8 - 1. 0 µm, the ratios of the STIS and NICMOS fluxes for brightest/faintest stars disagree by almost 25 %. ACS spectrophotometry for two of the same stars in the same wavelength band agrees with STIS to 2 %. A comparison of the grism spectrophotometry directly with ACS F 850 LP and F 892 N photometry for eight stars again verifies the need to correct the NICMOS grism data for non-linearity. After correction, the NICMOS grism fluxes have uncertainties ranging up to ~ 3 % at 1. 7 µm. The possible effect of this newly discovered apparent non-linearity on NICMOS photometry is being investigated with new NICMOS photometric observations and by comparisons with independent IR data sets...|$|R

For white light, the <b>absolute</b> <b>sensitivity</b> found was 5.9 x 10−14 watts / steradian-cm2.

40|$|Purpose of reviewThis study aims {{to discuss}} {{possible}} reasons why research {{to date has}} not forged direct links between light at night, acute melatonin suppression or circadian disruption, and risks for disease. Recent FindingsData suggest that irregular light 2 ̆ 013 dark patterns or light exposures at the wrong circadian time can lead to circadian disruption and disease risks. However, there remains an urgent need to: (1) specify light stimulus in terms of circadian rather than visual response; (2) when translating research from animals to humans, consider species-specific spectral and <b>absolute</b> <b>sensitivities</b> to light; (3) relate the characteristics of photometric measurement of light at night to the operational characteristics of the circadian system; and (4) examine how humans may be experiencing too little daytime light, not just too much light at night.

40|$|AbstractThe factors {{determining}} {{the sensitivity of}} space-charge-dominated (SCD) unipolar ion sources, such as electrospray (ESP) and corona atmospheric pressure ionization (API) have been studied theoretically. The most important parameters are the ion density and ion drift time {{in the vicinity of}} the sampling orifice. These are obtained by solving a system of differential equations, “the space-charge problem. ” For some simple geometries, analytical solutions are known. For a more realistic “needle-in-can” geometry, a solution to the space-charge problem was obtained using a finite-element method. The results illustrate some general characteristics of SCD ion sources. It is shown that for typical operating conditions the minimum voltage required to overcome the space-charge effect in corona API or ESP ion sources constitutes a dominant or significant fraction of total applied voltage. Further, the electric field and the ion density in the region of the ion-sampling orifice as well as the ion residence time in the source are determined mainly by the space charge. Finally, <b>absolute</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of corona API ion sources were calculated by using a geometry-independent treatment of space charge...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDirect-phi {{perception}} elicited by a reverse-phi (i. e. reversed-polarity) stimulus {{may well}} be accounted for, if the front-end filters of a classical Reichardt unit are full-wave rectifiers. It is shown that reverse-phi perception is progressively replaced by direct-phi perception when either the spatial or the temporal modulation of the reversed-polarity stimuli are decreased. Reverse-phi perception is very weak or absent for spatial and temporal frequencies ⩽ 1 c/deg and ⩽ 3. 75 Hz, respectively, indicating that the sensitivity of a linear mechanism is weak or null within this frequency range. By pitting against each other reverse- and direct-phi stimuli, the relative sensitivities of the putative motion mechanisms with linear (Fourier) and full-wave rectified (non-Fourier) front-end filters were assessed for a large range of spatial and temporal frequencies. <b>Absolute</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of the two mechanisms were estimated {{on the assumption that}} they contribute through probability summation to the overall spatiotemporal sensitivity surface described by Kelly [(1979) Journal of the Optical Society of America, 69, 1340 – 1349].

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} in {{the notion that a}} significant component of the heterogeneity retrieved in random coefficients models may actually relate to variations in <b>absolute</b> <b>sensitivities,</b> a phenomenon referred to as scale heterogeneity. As a result, a number of authors have tried to explicitly model such scale heterogeneity, which is shared across coefficients, and separate it from heterogeneity in individual coefficients. This direction of work has in part motivated the development of specialised modelling tools such as the G-MNL model. While not disagreeing with the notion that scale heterogeneity across respondents exists, this paper argues that attempts in the literature to disentangle scale heterogeneity from heterogeneity in individual coefficients in discrete choice models are misguided. In particular, we show how the various model specifications can in fact simply be seen as different parameterisations, and that any gains in fit obtained in random scale models are the result of using more flexible distributions, rather than an ability to capture scale heterogeneity. We illustrate our arguments through an empirical example and show how the conclusions from past work are based on misinterpretations of model results...|$|R

This method possesses the inherent power {{to detect and}} structurally characterize covalent modifications. <b>Absolute</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization and high-energy collision-induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry are exploited to determine the mass and sequence of subpicomole sample quantities of tryptic peptides. These data permit mass matching and sequence homology searching of computerized peptide mass and protein sequence data bases for known proteins and design of oligonucleotide probes for cloning unknown proteins. We have identified 11 proteins in lysates of human A 375 melanoma cells, including: alpha-enolase, cytokeratin, stathmin, protein disulfide isomerase, tropomyosin, Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, nucleoside diphosphate kinase A, galaptin, and triosephosphate isomerase. We have characterized several posttranslational modifications and chemical modifications that may result from electrophoresis or subsequent sample processing steps. Detection of comigrating and covalently modified proteins illustrates the necessity of peptide sequencing and the advantages of tandem mass spectrometry to reliably and unambiguously establish the identity of each protein.
