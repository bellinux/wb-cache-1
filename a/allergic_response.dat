5|$|Antibodies are glycoproteins {{belonging}} to the immunoglobulin superfamily. They constitute most of the gamma globulin fraction of the blood proteins. They are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains. There are several different types of antibody heavy chains that define the five different types of crystallisable fragments (Fc) that may {{be attached to the}} antigen-binding fragments. The five different types of Fc regions allow antibodies to be grouped into five isotypes. Each Fc region of a particular antibody isotype is able to bind to its specific Fc Receptor (except for IgD, which is essentially the BCR), thus allowing the antigen-antibody complex to mediate different roles depending on which FcR it binds. The ability of an antibody to bind to its corresponding FcR is further modulated by the structure of the glycan(s) present at conserved sites within its Fc region. The ability of antibodies to bind to FcRs helps to direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter. For example, IgE is responsible for an <b>allergic</b> <b>response</b> consisting of mast cell degranulation and histamine release. IgE's Fab paratope binds to allergic antigen, for example house dust mite particles, while its Fc region binds to Fc receptor ε. The allergen-IgE-FcRε interaction mediates allergic signal transduction to induce conditions such as asthma.|$|E

40|$|Epidemiological {{evidence}} suggests that formaldehyde (FA) exposure may influence the prevalence and severity of allergic asthma. However, the role of genetic background in FA-induced asthma-like responses is poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the nature and severity of asthma-like responses triggered by exposure to different doses of FA together with or without ovalbumin (OVA) in two genetically different mouse strains-BALB/c and C 57 BL/ 6. Both mouse strains {{were divided into two}} main groups: the non-sensitized group and the OVA-sensitized group. All the groups were exposed to 0, 0. 5 or 3. 0 mg/m 3 FA for 6 h/day over 25 consecutive days. At 24 h after the final FA exposure, the pulmonary parameters were evaluated. We found that FA exposure induced Th 2 -type <b>allergic</b> <b>responses</b> in non-sensitized BALB/c and C 57 BL/ 6 mice. In addition, FA-induced <b>allergic</b> <b>responses</b> were significantly more prominent in BALB/c mice than in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. In sensitized BALB/c mice, however, FA exposure suppressed the development of OVA-induced <b>allergic</b> <b>responses.</b> Exposure to 3. 0 mg/m 3 FA in sensitized C 57 BL/ 6 mice also led to suppressed <b>allergic</b> <b>responses,</b> whereas exposure to 0. 5 mg/m 3 FA resulted in exacerbated <b>allergic</b> <b>responses</b> to OVA. Our findings suggest that FA exposure can induce differential airway inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness in BALB/c and C 57 BL/ 6 mice...|$|R

25|$|Hypersensitivity {{reactions}} are less common in nonantibiotic sulfonamides, and, though controversial, {{the available evidence}} suggests those with hypersensitivity to sulfonamide antibiotics {{do not have an}} increased risk of hypersensitivity reaction to the nonantibiotic agents. A key component to the <b>allergic</b> <b>response</b> to sulfonamide antibiotics is the arylamine group at N4, found in sulfamethoxazole, sulfasalazine, sulfadiazine, and the anti-retrovirals amprenavir and fosamprenavir. Other sulfonamide drugs do not contain this arylamine group; available evidence suggests that patients who are allergic to arylamine sulfonamides do not cross-react to sulfonamides that lack the arylamine group, and may therefore safely take non-arylamine sulfonamides. It has therefore been argued that the terms 'sulfonamide allergy' or 'sulfa allergy' are misleading, and should be replaced by a reference to a specific drug (e.g. 'cotrimoxazole allergy').|$|E

40|$|Although Cryptococcus neoformans is {{recognized}} {{for its ability}} to cause meningoencephalitis and pneumonia among immunocompromised persons, subclinical pulmonary infection is also common among immunocom-petent persons. The significance of this infection is unknown. Using a rat model, we explored the potential for pulmonary cryptococcosis to modify <b>allergic</b> <b>responses</b> and airway reactivity. Our findings indicate that localized pulmonary cryptococcal infection (but not disseminated infection) can exacerbate <b>allergic</b> <b>responses</b> to respiratory challenge with ovalbumin, as measured by total immunoglobulin E levels, ovalbumin-specific immunoglobulin E titers, and eosinophil content of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Infection-associated en-hancement of <b>allergic</b> <b>responses</b> was not dependent on cryptococcal encapsulation and was partially ameliorated by the administration of fluconazole. Increases in both the number of goblet cells and airway responsiveness, which are also features of reactive airway disease, were also present with pulmonary infection. An examination of lung cytokine levels in the context of active pulmonary infection revealed increased expression of interleukin (IL) – 10, tumor necrosis factor–a, and IL- 13, but not IL- 12 or interferon-g. In contrast, systemic infection was associated with higher levels of interferon-g but lower levels of IL- 13. Our studies highlight the potential for localized pulmonary C. neoformans infection to potentiate <b>allergic</b> <b>responses</b> and airway reactivity and suggest a potential role for subclinical pulmonary cryptococcosis in the pathogenesis of asthma...|$|R
25|$|Aside {{from these}} ambient allergens, {{allergic}} reactions {{can result from}} foods, insect stings, and reactions to medications like aspirin and antibiotics such as penicillin. Symptoms of food allergy include abdominal pain, bloating, vomiting, diarrhea, itchy skin, and swelling of the skin during hives. Food allergies rarely cause respiratory (asthmatic) reactions, or rhinitis. Insect stings, food, antibiotics, and certain medicines may produce a systemic <b>allergic</b> <b>response</b> that is also called anaphylaxis; multiple organ systems can be affected, including the digestive system, the respiratory system, and the circulatory system. Depending on the rate of severity, it can cause a skin reactions, bronchoconstriction, swelling, low blood pressure, coma, and death. This type of reaction can be triggered suddenly, or the onset can be delayed. The nature of anaphylaxis is such that the reaction can seem to be subsiding, but may recur throughout a period of time.|$|E

40|$|Davallia mariesii Moore (Drynaria rhizome extract (DRE)) {{is widely}} {{known for its}} {{efficacy}} in treating inflammation, arteriosclerosis, and bone injuries. This study evaluated whether treatment with DRE inhibited FcɛRI-mediated <b>allergic</b> <b>responses</b> in the RBL- 2 H 3 mast cells and investigated the early- and late-phase mechanisms by which DRE exerts its antiallergic effects. IgE anti-DNP/DNP-HSA-sensitized RBL- 2 H 3 mast cells were tested for cytotoxicity to DRE, followed by the assessment of β-hexosaminidase release. We measured the amounts of inflammatory mediators (e. g., histamine, PGD 2, TNF-α, IL- 4, and IL- 6) and examined the expression of genes involved in arachidonate and FcεRI signaling pathways. In addition, we confirmed the antiallergic effects of DRE on passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) in mice. DRE inhibited RBL- 2 H 3 mast cell degranulation and production of allergic mediators in them. In early <b>allergic</b> <b>responses,</b> DRE reduced expression of FcεRI signaling-related genes (e. g., Syk, Lyn, and Fyn) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation in mast cells. In late <b>allergic</b> <b>responses,</b> DRE reduced PGD 2 release and COX- 2 expression and cPLA 2 phosphorylation in FcɛRI-mediated mast cells. Lastly, 250 – 500 mg/kg DRE significantly attenuated the IgE-induced PCA reaction in mice. These findings provide novel information on the molecular mechanisms underlying the antiallergic effects of DRE in FcɛRI-mediated <b>allergic</b> <b>responses...</b>|$|R

2500|$|According to Dr. Hopkin, asthma {{involves}} atopic allergy, {{which in}} turn involves the release of mediators that induce inflammation. [...] In 2007, Dr. Melendez and his associates studied filarial nematodes and ES-62, a protein that nematodes secrete in their host. [...] They discovered that pure ES-62 prevents the release of allergenic inflammatory mediators in mice, resulting in weaker allergic and asthmatic symptoms.

40|$|Mast {{cells are}} {{responsible}} for IgE-mediated <b>allergic</b> <b>responses</b> through the secretion of various inflammatory cytokines and mediators. Therefore, the pharmacological regulation of mast cell activation is an important goal {{in the development of}} novel anti-allergic drugs. In this study, we found that spiraeoside (SP) inhibits mast cell activation and <b>allergic</b> <b>responses</b> in vivo. SP dose-dependently inhibited the degranulation induced by IgE-antigen (Ag) stimulation in RBL- 2 H 3 mast cells without cytotoxic effects. At the molecular level, SP reduced the Ag-induced phosphorylation and subsequent activation of phospholipase C-gamma 2 (PLC-gamma 2). Moreover, SP inhibited the phosphorylation of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), linker for activation of T cells (LAT), and downstream MAPKs, such as ERK 1 / 2, p 38, and JNK, eventually attenuating expression of TNF-alpha and IL- 4. Finally, we found that SP significantly inhibited IgE-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) in mice. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that SP suppresses IgE-mediated mast cell activation and <b>allergic</b> <b>responses</b> by inhibiting Lyn-induced PLC-gamma 2 /MAPK signaling in mast cellsopen 0...|$|R

2500|$|Diagnoses {{of wheat}} allergy may deserve special consideration. [...] Omega-5 gliadin, {{the most potent}} wheat allergen, cannot be {{detected}} in whole wheat preparations; it must be extracted and partially digested (similar to how it degrades in the intestine) to reach full activity. Other studies show that digestion of wheat proteins to about 10 amino acids can increase the <b>allergic</b> <b>response</b> 10 fold. Certain allergy tests may not be suitable to detect all wheat allergies, resulting in cryptic allergies. [...] Because many of the symptoms associated with wheat allergies, such as sacroiliitis, eczema and asthma, may be related or unrelated to a wheat allergy, medical deduction {{can be an effective}} way of determining the cause. If symptoms are alleviated by immunosuppressant drugs, such as Prednisone, an allergy-related cause is likely.

2500|$|In {{hereditary}} angioedema, often {{no direct}} cause is identifiable, although mild trauma, including dental work and other stimuli, can cause attacks. There is usually no associated itch or urticaria, {{as it is}} not an <b>allergic</b> <b>response.</b> [...] Patients with HAE can also have recurrent episodes (often called [...] "attacks") of abdominal pain, usually accompanied by intense vomiting, weakness, and in some cases, watery diarrhea, and an unraised, nonitchy splotchy/swirly rash. [...] These stomach attacks can last one to five days on average, and can require hospitalization for aggressive pain management and hydration. Abdominal attacks have also been known to cause {{a significant increase in the}} patient's white blood cell count, usually in the vicinity of 13,000 to 30,000. [...] As the symptoms begin to diminish, the white count slowly begins to decrease, returning to normal when the attack subsides.

40|$|Mast cell activation, mediates type- 1 <b>allergic</b> <b>responses,</b> one of {{the most}} {{powerful}} reactions of the immune system. However, mast cells activation is becoming increasingly linked to inflammatory, autoimmunity, and to adaptive immunity by regulating T-cell activation. |$|R
40|$|<b>Allergic</b> <b>{{responses}}</b> are Th 2 - and IgE-mediated immune {{responses that}} evolved {{to protect against}} environmental substances and parasites. How-ever, these responses {{can also lead to}} allergy when inadvertently activated by noninfectious envi-ronmental antigens and cause harmful symptoms such as itching, inflammation, or tissue injury. As to our current understanding, mast cells {{are at the center of}} <b>allergic</b> <b>responses</b> (Galli et al., 2005; Bischoff, 2007). Mast cells are BM-derived hematopoietic cells localized under surfaces ex-posed to the external environment, such as the skin, airways, and intestine. They function as sentinel cells in host defense reactions includ-ing immediate hypersensitivity <b>responses</b> and <b>allergic</b> <b>responses</b> (Galli et al., 2005). Activated mast cells trigger <b>allergic</b> <b>responses</b> by releasing preformed granule-associated chemical media-tors, producing multiple cytokines and che-mokines, and secreting de novo synthesized arachidonic acid metabolites and various pro-teins (Metcalfe et al., 1997; Bischoff, 2007). Mast cells recognize antigens via IgE and specific Fc receptors, termed FcRI. Binding of multivalent antigen to FcRI-bound IgE in-duces receptor aggregation and triggers mast cell activation (Kinet, 1999; Siraganian, 2003). FcRI is expressed on the surface of mast cell as a tetrameric complex consisting of an IgE-binding subunit, a signal-modulating subunit, and two signal-transduction subunits (Kraft and Kinet, 2007). The signaling cascades elicited by FcRI aggregation in mast cells have been ex-tensively studied (Kalesnikoff and Galli, 2008). Briefly, the conserved immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) within the cyto-plasmic tails of the and subunits are rapidly phosphorylated upon FcRI stimulation in a Lyn-dependent manner (Garman et al., 1999...|$|R
