5|$|The meat, blubber and fur {{coats of}} {{pinnipeds}} {{have traditionally been}} used by indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Seals have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. They are commonly kept in captivity and are even sometimes trained to perform tricks and tasks. Once relentlessly hunted by commercial industries for their products, seals and walruses are now protected by international law. The Japanese sea lion and the Caribbean monk seal have become extinct in the past century, while the Mediterranean monk seal and Hawaiian monk seal are ranked endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Besides hunting, pinnipeds also face threats from <b>accidental</b> trapping, <b>marine</b> <b>pollution,</b> and conflicts with local people.|$|R

40|$|Although {{the waters}} of Belgium only form a minor part of the North Sea, they contain some of the busiest {{shipping}} routes {{in the world with}} the Dover Strait and some of the biggest European ports in the immediate vicinity. It is therefore recognized as a key maritime risk area, also in terms of ship-source oil pollution. This chapter first discusses the significant, stepwise decrease of illegal oil discharges from ships in and around {{the waters of}} Belgium based on national aerial surveillance data since 1991 but also gives indications as to why the ecological quality objectives have not yet been met despite this decline. It further gives an overview of the accidental oil pollution incidents in this key risk area over the last 30 years and reflects on the high level of <b>accidental</b> <b>marine</b> <b>pollution</b> risk. Finally, the various measures are discussed that have been and will be undertaken in terms of oil pollution prevention, enforcement, preparedness and response with the aim to (further) reduce the oil pollution pressure in this environmentally sensitive area...|$|E

Preduvjet za to bilo je stvaranje odgovarajućeg pravnog okvira, što se i postiglo donošenjem Zakona o sigurnosti pri odobalnom istraživanju i eksploataciji ugljikovodika u srpnju 2015. godine. Autorica u ovom radu razmatra odredbe navedenog zakona s posebnim osvrtom na zaštitu morskog okoliša. Slijedom toga, analizirane su i odredbe Plana intervencija kod iznenadnih onečišćenja mora u korelaciji s prethodno spomenutim Zakonom. In {{order to}} reduce the import of energy sources and to improve energy {{situation}} in the Republic of Croatia, our country has decided to revive offshore exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons. The prerequisite was the creation of an appropriate legal framework, which was achieved by the adoption of the Act on safety in offshore exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons in July 2015. The author of this paper reviews the provisions of the before mentioned Act with special emphasis on the protection of marine environment. Consequently, the author also analyzes the provisions of the Plan of Intervention in the Case of <b>Accidental</b> <b>Marine</b> <b>Pollution</b> in correlation with the aforementioned Law...|$|E
40|$|Oil spills {{relating}} to shipping incidents remain of substantial concern {{with respect to}} marine pollution. Whilst most frequently a reactive approach is adopted in post-incident monitoring (for the specific product involved), this paper reports important physical and compositional characteristics of commonly transported oils and oil products to afford pro-active assessments. These properties include specific gravity, viscosity, elemental composition and, of particular relevance, the relative class compositions between aliphatics, aromatics, resins and asphaltenes. The latter were determined experimentally using thin layer chromatography with flame ionization detection. Diagnostic ratios of specific compounds are reported, statistically analysed, and their significance in identification of different oil types and the weathering processes is discussed. The influence of the properties on fates under different environmental conditions (selected to represent contrasting European regional seas) are examined using the NOAA Automated Data Inquiry for Oil Spills (ADIOS 2) model. Relative contributions of the different environmental conditions and properties {{to the fate of}} the oil at sea are discussed.

40|$|International audienceTurbot Psetta maxima {{were exposed}} 5 {{days to the}} {{dissolved}} fraction of fuel oil number 2, then decontaminated over 30 days in clean sea water. Biliary metabolites and ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity were evaluated {{during and after the}} contamination. These results were compared with chromosomal damage measured by flow cytometry (FCM). Erythrocyte nuclear abnormality, micronuclei and immaturity were also evaluated over the exposure period. Biliary metabolites and EROD analyses showed a clear and early response: biliary metabolites were detected from the first day of contamination to the 14 th day of depuration, EROD activity increased during the contamination period reached a maximum 3 days after the beginning of the decontamination and decreased to the control value after 1 month of depuration. FCM showed a bimodal response: a first increase of coefficient of variation of blood cell DNA content was observed during the contamination and a second one started after 14 days of depuration and was maintained for at least 2 weeks. Erythrocyte morphology analysis showed a strong increase in nuclear abnormality during the contamination period. These results confirm previous work and show that in the context of <b>marine</b> <b>accidental</b> <b>pollution</b> by heavy fuel oil, the measurements of chromosomal damage by FCM allow the detection of a genotoxic response in fishes...|$|R

The purpose of this legal research is to propose the regulating of Australia’s responsibility toward trans-boundary <b>marine</b> <b>pollution</b> caused by seabed oil mining. This research is a normative legal research in which the legal resources are collected through library study and interview with resource persons. This research findings show that the regulating of state responsibility on transboundary <b>marine</b> <b>pollution</b> from seabed oil mining has to be regulated in a bilateral agreement, and {{it is important that the}} agreement should include the elements of state responsibility, the form of state responsibility, the kinds of state responsibility, institution responsible for calculating compensation, destinction of responsibilities (state or operator / oil company), termination of responsibility, the territorial in which the agreement to be applied, and qualification of oil mining (off-shore oil mining or deep sea oil mining). Accordingly, Indonesian government is recommended to continue the negotiation with Australian government to reach an agreement about the regulating of state responsibility on trans-boundary <b>marine</b> <b>pollution</b> caused by seabed oil mining and it is also necessary to adopt the ILC Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts and add some provisions...|$|R
