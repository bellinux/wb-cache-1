25|$|Some {{people have}} {{characterized}} his removal as a rendition. That {{is not what}} happened here. It was a deportation.

500|$|... did {{not play}} any role in the {{operational}} preparations for the plot against Hitler <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not know which post {{he was supposed to}} assume after a successful coup. Hence, the Field-Marshal was definitely not part of the most inner circle of the 20 July plotters. At the same time, however, he {{was more than just a}} mere sympathiser and paid for this with his life. He consequently deserves a firm place in the military resistance against Hitler to a greater extent than it has recently been acknowledged in academia and in public.|$|E
500|$|Dr. W. A. Claxton, {{chief of}} the Miami Department of Public Welfare, {{requested}} antitoxin, typhoid serum, and at least 200tetanus serums. The Florida Department of Health granted the request. Of the inoculations distributed, there were 10,349for typhoid, 1,025for smallpox, and 337for tetanus. A health bulletin issued on September28 indicated that due to vaccinations and other efforts by state and local health departments, there was [...] "no outbreak of typhoid, malaria, influenza, or any other communicable diseases, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> no anticipate any."

Everybody's very involved with that. And it constantly gets played with. What I love about Game of Thrones is that the positioning of the music is so well done, because it's not overdone. When the music cuts in, it really has something to say." [...] "Light of the Seven" [...] reached No. 1 on Billboard's Spotify Viral 50 chart on its release.|$|E
500|$|At 08:00 on {{the morning}} of 27 August, after a {{messenger}} sent by Khalid requested parley from Cave, the consul replied that he would only have salvation if he agreed to the terms of the ultimatum. At 08:30 a further messenger from Khalid declared that [...] "We have no intention of hauling down our flag <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not believe you would open fire on us"; Cave replied that [...] "We do not want to open fire, but unless you do as you are told we shall certainly do so."

500|$|When he said Jesus again I couldn't take it, and for {{the only}} time in my life I was discourteous, which I regret to this day. I said, [...] "Mr. Mauriac," [...] we called him Maître, [...] "ten years or so ago, I have seen children, {{hundreds}} of Jewish children, who suffered more than Jesus did on his cross <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not speak about it." [...] I felt all of a sudden so embarrassed. I closed my notebook and went to the elevator. He ran after me. He pulled me back; he sat down in his chair, and I in mine, and he began weeping.... And then, at the end, without saying anything, he simply said, [...] "You know, maybe you should talk about it." ...|$|E

500|$|However, the Singapore Court of Appeal {{dismissed}} {{the applicability of}} both cases {{on the ground that}} the terms of Article 14 of the Constitution differ materially from Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which was relied upon by the court in Lingens; as well as the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which were relied upon by the court in New York Times. The public figure doctrine was thus expressly rejected by the Court. Thean J. said: [...] "Such criticisms or attacks must, in our opinion, respect the bounds set by the law of defamation, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not accept that the publication of false and defamatory allegations, {{even in the absence of}} actual malice on the part of the publisher, should be allowed to pass with impunity." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{said that}} the {{recording}} of [...] "The Girl Is Mine" [...] {{was one of his}} most enjoyable moments in the studio. He stated, [...] "One of my favourite songs to record, of all my recordings as a solo artist, is probably [...] "The Girl Is Mine", because working with Paul McCartney was pretty exciting and we just literally had fun. It was like lots of kibitzing and playing, and throwing stuff at each other, and making jokes. We actually recorded the (instrumental) track and the vocals pretty much live at the same time, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> have footage of it, but it's never been shown." [...] He concluded, [...] "Maybe one day we'll give you a sneak preview of it." [...] The footage of the pair was later shown at The Paul McCartney World Tour.|$|E
500|$|The {{circumstances}} of the sinking were featured by a BBC programme. According to this, the despatch of Gloucester, alone and low on fuel and anti-aircraft ammunition (less than 20% remaining), into danger was a [...] "grievous error". Furthermore, the failure to attempt to rescue survivors after dark was [...] "contrary to usual Navy practice". A survivor commented [...] "The tradition in the Navy is that when a ship has sunk, a vessel is sent back to pick up survivors under cover of darkness. That did not happen <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not know why. We were picked up by Germans." [...] On 30 May 1941, {{in a letter to}} the First Sea Lord, Sir Dudley Pound, Cunningham wrote, [...] "The sending back of Gloucester and Fiji to the Greyhound was another grave error and cost us those two ships. They were practically out of ammunition but even had they been full up I think they would have gone. The Commanding Officer of Fiji told me that the air over Gloucester was black with planes." ...|$|E
