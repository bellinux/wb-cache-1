5|$|Near Lejjun, {{the remains}} of the ancient {{fortress}} of Megiddo on Tell al Mutesellim dominate the entry to the plain from the Musmus Pass. Here <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>small</b> garrison could control the routes across the Esdraelon Plain where the armies of Egyptians, Romans, Mongols, Arabs, and Crusaders who had fought Saladin near Afulah during the Battle of Al-Fule, as well as of Napoleon, had marched and fought towards Nazareth, the Galilean Hills, and Damascus.|$|E

30|$|In Fig.  3, {{the band}} gap {{of the samples}} (numbers 1 – 9) is plotted and compared. As illustrated, with the {{increase}} in the flow rate of oxygen at different temperatures, the band gap decreases. This is because as the flow rate of oxygen increases, ITO thin films are better and more efficiently crystallized and as the thin film structures become more crystalline, it is more prone to have <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>smaller</b> band gap. Also it is worth noting that, the layer baked at 500  °C and flow rate of 1.5  Nl min− 1 demonstrates higher crystallinity (see Fig.  1) and hence will be expected to have <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>smaller</b> band gap and increased conductivity.|$|R

If the birth rate <b>a</b> is <b>relatively</b> large or the Allee effect <b>A</b> is <b>relatively</b> <b>small,</b> then system (4) has a positive equilibrium E^*, which guarantees the coexistence of system (4).|$|R

5|$|Specialised subsets of English arise spontaneously in {{international}} communities, for example, among international business people, as an auxiliary language.

5|$|The first {{station to}} be rebuilt was Old Saybrook, the busy eastern {{terminus}} of the line. The new high-level island platform and pedestrian bridge opened on November 1, 2002. Old Saybrook had previous had only a single side platform serving <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>small</b> number of Amtrak trains; the rebuilt has two platforms serving three tracks, to allow Amtrak trains in both directions to stop or pass even while a SLE train is at the station.|$|E

5|$|The size of {{the brain}} and a person's {{intelligence}} are not strongly related. Studies tend to indicate small to moderate correlations (averaging around 0.3 to 0.4) between brain volume and IQ. The most consistent associations are observed within the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, the hippocampi, and the cerebellum, but these only account for <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>small</b> amount of variance in IQ, which itself has only a partial relationship to general intelligence and real-world performance.|$|E
5|$|Without {{the support}} of the Communists, the {{increasingly}} unpopular and destructive Confrontation quickly came to an end. Secret talks between Malaysia and Indonesia were held throughout late 1965 and early 1966, and a peace treaty was signed in August of the latter year. Sukarno was toppled from power by the generals on accusations of collaborating with the rebels and replaced by Suharto as President on 12 March of the following year. The conflict had been an unqualified success for Britain and the West, as she had subdued a rising Communist power in Asia and prevented the 'domino effect' from taking off. And from a purely tactical standpoint, it had been a strong performance from British troops and commanders, as they had managed to confine a brewing disaster on a Vietnamese scale to <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>small</b> bush war that had <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>small</b> human cost and stabilised a potentially dangerous political situation of South East Asia.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} are being studied for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, including bedaquiline and delamanid. Bedaquiline received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in late 2012. The {{safety and effectiveness}} of these new agents are still uncertain, because {{they are based on}} the results of <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>small</b> studies. However, existing data suggest that patients taking bedaquiline in addition to standard TB therapy are five times more likely to die than those without the new drug, which has resulted in medical journal articles raising health policy questions about why the FDA approved the drug and whether financial ties to the company making bedaquiline influenced physicians' support for its use.|$|E
