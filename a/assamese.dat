25|$|The Eastern Nagari {{script was}} {{originally}} {{not associated with}} any particular regional language, but was prevalent as the main script in the eastern regions of Medieval India. The script was also used to write Sanskrit. Epics of Hindu scripture, including the Mahabharata or Ramayana, were written in older versions of the Eastern Nagari script in this region. After the medieval period, the use of Sanskrit as the sole written language gave way to Pali, and the vernacular dialects of Pali eventually evolved into Bengali, <b>Assamese</b> and other related languages. Sankardev used the script in the 15th and 16th centuries to compose his oeuvre in <b>Assamese</b> and Brajavali {{the language of the}} Bhakti poets; and before him, Madhava Kandali used it to write the <b>Assamese</b> Ramayana in the 14th century. It was also used by the later Ahom kings to write the Buranjis, the Ahom chronicles, in the <b>Assamese</b> language. There is a rich legacy of East sub-continental literature written in this script, which is still occasionally used to write Sanskrit today.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Assamese</b> {{history has}} been derived from {{multiple}} sources. The Ahom kingdom of medieval Assam maintained chronicles, called Buranjis, written in the Ahom and the <b>Assamese</b> languages. History of ancient Assam comes from a corpus of Kamarupa inscriptions on rock, copper plates, clay; royal grants, etc. that the Kamarupa kings issued during their reign.

25|$|Purandar Singha and Ruchinath Burhagohain regrouped {{their troops}} in Guwahati. The Burmese {{commander}} Momai Barua marched towards Guwahati {{at the head}} of a large Burmese force.

25|$|Since the {{restructuring}} of Assam after independence, communal tensions and violence remain. Separatist groups began forming along ethnic lines, and demands for autonomy and sovereignty grew, resulting in the fragmentation of Assam. In 1961, the government of Assam passed legislation making use of the <b>Assamese</b> language compulsory. It was withdrawn later under pressure from Bengali speaking people in Cachar. In the 1980s the Brahmaputra valley saw a six-year Assam Agitation triggered by {{the discovery of a}} sudden rise in registered voters on electoral rolls. It tried to force the government to identify and deport foreigners illegally migrating from neighbouring Bangladesh and changing the demographics of the Indigenous <b>Assamese</b> people and also provide constitutional, legislative, administrative and cultural safeguards for the Indigenous <b>Assamese</b> people. The agitation ended after an accord between its leaders and the Union Government, which remained unimplemented, causing simmering discontent.|$|E
