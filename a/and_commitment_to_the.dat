5|$|Educated at {{home until}} she was seven, Bishop then went to a private {{elementary}} school {{until the age of}} nine. In 1909, then ten years old, she entered the progressive Fielden School in her hometown of Manchester, where she studied for three years. She completed her high school education at the Manchester High School for Girls. Though Bishop intended to study chemistry, her lack of education in physics meant that she could not pursue her preferred course in the Honours School of Chemistry. Instead, she matriculated at Manchester University in October 1918 to study botany, chemistry, and zoology. That first-year course in zoology sparked her lifelong interest in <b>and</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> field. She graduated with honours from the School of Zoology, receiving her Bachelor of Science degree in 1921; she received her master's degree in 1922. During her undergraduate years, under the tutelage of the helminthologist R.A. Wardle and the protozoologist Geoffrey Lapage, Bishop studied ciliates acquired from local ponds.|$|E

The church experienced sporadic growth and instability in South India due to corruption among church ministers, lack of funds for outreach, and lack of identity formation <b>and</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> church among new members.

25|$|The 1980s saw {{a return}} to mediocrity, with California posting only one winning season in the entire decade. Joe Kapp was the most famous coach in this period. Kapp was a Cal quarterback during the 1950s and was {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} greatest players in Cal history (see the 1940s and 1950s section). Even though he did not have any coaching experience, because of his infamous determination <b>and</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> team, both as a California Golden Bear and as an NFL Minnesota Viking, Kapp was hired as the head coach in 1982. Unfortunately Kapp's success as a player did not translate into success as a coach. While his first season could be considered as a success, with the Bears winning seven games and reaching the sixth place in the Pac-10 standings, in the following years they could not do any better with Cal being in the last place in 1984 and 1985. The 1986 season was Kapp's last, during which Cal finished ninth in the Pac-10.|$|E
25|$|Through his {{prolonged}} stay in India House, however, Acharya {{gradually became}} {{deeply involved in}} its activities. Scotland Yard had at one point been able to infiltrate the organisation with an Indian student {{by the name of}} Kritikar, who had arrived at the organisation with a story similar to that of Acharya, and had for some time been able to report to Scotland Yard about its activities before he was uncovered and forced by Savarkar to confess at gunpoint. After this, Kirtikar's reports are believed to have been regularly screened by Savarkar before they were passed on to Scotland Yard. For some time, Acharya himself had been under suspicion of being a Scotland Yard mole before he was able to convince his fellow residents of his integrity <b>and</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nationalist cause. It is believed that Acharya was instructed by V.V.S. Iyer and V.D. Savarkar to set himself up as an informer to Scotland Yard, which they reasoned would allow them to carefully feed information to the police and also help them provide a corroboration to the version of reports that were being sent by Kritikar. For his reports, Acharya took five pounds (later doubled) which also eased from his fellow house-mates the financial strain of supporting him.|$|E

He was presented to the Croatian media as a successor to Hrvoje Čale and competition to Carlos Santos on the left back position, and was issued a number 3 jersey. The club then signed another left flank player Mirko Hrgović on 18 July, who would quickly establish himself as a first-choice left back for the club, which eventually saw Ibáñez failing to make an appearance in a couple of early season matches. He was meant to play in his first official match for the club on 23 July in the Champions League first qualifying round against Linfield, but was disrupted by a shoulder injury. His debut appearance for Dinamo Zagreb came on 17 August in a 6–0 league win against Cibalia. Eleven days later, he also debuted in the Champions League, making an appearance as a substitute in a 3–1 defeat against Shakhtar Donetsk. Soon he established himself as a first team regular and was subject to constant praise by the Croatian football critics for his performances <b>and</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> club.|$|E
