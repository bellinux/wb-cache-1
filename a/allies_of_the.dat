5|$|The Cripple Creek strike also {{transformed}} the Western Federation of Miners enormously {{as a political}} entity. The year-old union, weak and penniless before the strike, became widely admired among miners throughout the West. Thousands of workers joined the union {{over the next few}} years. Politicians and labor officials throughout the country became steady <b>allies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> union, and the WFM became a political force throughout much of the Rocky Mountain West.|$|E
50|$|During the Korean War the two {{countries}} were on opposing sides with the UK overseeing the British Commonwealth Forces Korea serving the United Nations (UN).

5|$|The Earls of Argyll {{appointed}} Captains {{to oversee}} Dunstaffnage, {{and keep it}} in readiness, on their behalf. Changes {{were made to the}} buildings, particularly the gatehouse, which was rebuilt around this time. The Campbells were loyal <b>allies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> royal house, and Dunstaffnage was used as a base for government expeditions against the MacDonald Lords of the Isles, among others, during the 15th and 16th centuries. James IV visited Dunstaffnage on two occasions.|$|E
5|$|British troops {{proceeded}} {{to occupy the}} various forts in the Ohio Country and Great Lakes region previously garrisoned by the French. Even before the war officially ended with the Treaty of Paris (1763), the British Crown began to implement changes in order to administer its vastly expanded North American territory. While the French had long cultivated alliances among certain of the Native Americans, the British post-war approach was essentially to treat the Native Americans as a conquered people. Before long, Native Americans who had been <b>allies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defeated French found themselves increasingly dissatisfied with the British occupation and the new policies imposed by the victors.|$|E
5|$|Castillo Armas faced {{significant}} internal resistance, {{which was}} blamed on communist agitation. The government, plagued by corruption and soaring debt, became dependent on {{aid from the}} US. In 1957 Castillo Armas was assassinated by a palace guard with leftist sympathies. He {{was the first of}} a series of authoritarian rulers in Guatemala who were close <b>allies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US. His reversal of the reforms of his predecessors sparked a series of leftist insurgencies in the country after his death, culminating in the Guatemalan Civil War of 1960 to 1996.|$|E

5|$|For {{many years}} the Kaqchikel served as loyal <b>allies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> K'iche' Maya. The growing {{power of the}} Kaqchikel within the {{alliance}} eventually caused such friction that the Kaqchikel were forced to flee the K'iche' capital and found the city of Iximche. The Kaqchikel established their new capital upon an easily defensible ridge almost surrounded by deep ravines. Iximche developed quickly as a city and within 50 years of its foundation it had reached its maximum extent. The rulers of Iximche were four principal lords drawn from the four main clans of the Kaqchikel, although it was the lords of the Sotz'il and Xahil clans who held the real power.|$|E
5|$|In 1382, the Mamluk emir Barquq usurped {{the throne}} in Cairo, {{establishing}} the Burji regime. The latter were ethnic Circassians unlike their Turkmen Bahri predecessors, {{which resulted in}} frayed relations between the Turkmens of Keserwan and the new rulers. The tensions between the Turkmens of Keserwan and the Burji authorities contrasted with the Turkmens' principal rivals in Mount Lebanon, the Druze Buhturids, who embraced Sultan Barquq. When the latter was briefly toppled in a Bahri revolt in 1389, the Buhturids fought against the Bahri rebels in Damascus, while the Turkmen tribesmen assaulted the Druze Tanukhi tribesmen in Beirut and the surrounding hills. In those engagements and the executions that followed, the Turkmens killed seven of the eight Tanukhi Abi al-Jaysh Arslan emirs, Druze <b>allies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Buhturids.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, {{problems}} with the export policy were becoming apparent. The Soviets continued to sell newer aircraft designs to their clients, placing <b>allies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. at a disadvantage. Denied by the U.S., countries were turning to other vendors for modern fighters, notably France's Dassault Mirage 2000. Barry N. Blechman, Assistant Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, testified that the US reductions in foreign arms transfers had actually encouraged other nations and increased worldwide arms sales. At the same time, there was considerable pressure to provide a suitable aircraft for Taiwan.|$|E

5|$|In 211 BC an Aetolian {{assembly}} was convened {{for discussions}} with Rome. Laevinus {{pointed out the}} recent capture of Syracuse and Capua {{in the war against}} Carthage as evidence of Rome's rising fortunes, and offered to ally with them against the Macedonians. A treaty was signed. The Aetolians would conduct operations on land, the Romans at sea. Rome would keep any slaves and other booty taken and Aetolia would receive control of any territory acquired. Another provision of the treaty allowed for the inclusion of certain <b>allies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> League: Elis, Sparta, Messenia and Attalus I of Pergamon, as well as two Roman clients, the Illyrians Pleuratus and Scerdilaidas.|$|E
5|$|In Ireland, Dál Riata formed part of Ulster, {{ruled by}} Báetán mac Cairill of the Dál Fiatach. The other major {{grouping}} in Ulster were the disunited tribes of the Cruithne, later {{known as the}} Dál nAraidi. The most important Cruithne king in Áedán's time was Fiachnae mac Báetáin. Beyond the kingdom of Ulster, and generally hostile to it, were the various kingdoms and tribes of the Uí Néill and their subjects and <b>allies.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> Uí Néill kings, Áed mac Ainmuirech of the Cenél Conaill, Columba's first cousin once removed, {{was the most important}} during Áedán's reign.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1340s {{relations}} with the Byzantine Empire temporarily deteriorated. Ivan Alexander demanded the extradition of his cousin Šišman, one of the sons of Michael Asen III, threatening the Byzantine government with war. Ivan Alexander's show of force backfired, as the Byzantines managed to see through his intentions and sent against him the fleet of their ally, the Turkish emir of Smyrna Umur Beg. Landing in the Danube Delta, they pillaged the countryside and attacked nearby Bulgarian cities. Forced to restrain his demands, Ivan Alexander invaded the Byzantine Empire again {{at the end of}} 1341, claiming that he was summoned by the people of Adrianople. However, Ivan Alexander's troops were defeated twice by Turkish <b>allies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Byzantines near the city.|$|E

5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1794 {{the army of the}} French Republic overran the Dutch Republic. The French National Convention {{reformed}} the Dutch Republic into a revolutionary client state named the Batavian Republic. This event alarmed the government of Great Britain, erstwhile <b>allies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dutch, as the Dutch Empire controlled a number of strategically important colonies in the East Indies. The key to controlling European access to the region was the Dutch Cape Colony on the tip of Southern Africa; a naval force based there could dominate the trade routes between Europe and the East Indies, in particular the economically vital links between Britain and British India.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Artemisium, the Allies {{saw that}} they would {{probably}} {{not be able to}} hold the line for another day, such were their losses. They thus debated whether they should withdraw from Artemisium, whilst they awaited news from Thermopylae. Themistocles ordered the men to slaughter and barbecue the flocks of the Euboeans, so that they would not fall into Persian hands. Abronichus arrived on the liaison ship from Thermopylae and told the <b>Allies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> destruction of the Allied rearguard at Thermopylae. Since holding the Straits of Artemisium now no longer held any strategic purpose, and given their losses, the Allies decided to evacuate immediately.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU is {{supported}} by a variety of persons and organizations. There were over 1,000,000 members in 2017, and the ACLU annually receives thousands of grants from hundreds of charitable foundations. <b>Allies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ACLU in legal actions have included the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the American Jewish Congress, People For the American Way, the National Rifle Association, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the National Organization for Women.|$|E

5|$|The Hong Kong Institute of Planners, the {{majority}} of whose members work in government departments, had backed the in-situ preservation of the pier. There was uproar in May 2008 when it made an apparent U-turn in a position paper submitted to the government backing the relocation to a waterfront location, based on a sparsely attended meeting. It then submitted a revised paper presenting {{that a majority of}} its members supported such a move as a conclusion prior to the completion of a survey. A former vice-president of the institute questioned how the institute had become <b>allies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government.|$|E
5|$|The Tlaxcalan <b>allies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spanish who {{accompanied}} {{them in their}} invasion of Guatemala wrote their own accounts of the conquest; these included {{a letter to the}} Spanish king protesting at their poor treatment once the campaign was over. Other accounts were in the form of questionnaires answered before colonial magistrates to protest and register a claim for recompense. Two pictorial accounts painted in the stylised indigenous pictographic tradition have survived; these are the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan, which was probably painted in Ciudad Vieja in the 1530s, and the Lienzo de Tlaxcala, painted in Tlaxcala.|$|E
