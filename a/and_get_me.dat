25|$|Also in 1964, Audrey Hepburn {{starred in}} My Fair Lady, the {{film of the}} musical of the George Bernard Shaw play Pygmalion. George Cukor's {{decision}} to award the role of Eliza Doolittle to Hepburn was perceived by many as a snub to Julie Andrews, who had played the part to great acclaim on Broadway. This is another film with some famous songs, including Wouldn't it be Loverly, I Could have Danced all Night <b>and</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Me</b> to the Church on Time. Marni Nixon's voice was used in place of Audrey Hepburn's for the songs.|$|E
500|$|Recalling {{the release}} of Yellow Submarine in his 1977 book The Beatles Forever, Nicholas Schaffner {{described}} [...] "It's All Too Much" [...] as {{the only one of}} the new songs that appeared [...] "to have taken more than a few hours to write". He added: [...] " [...] highlights include some searing Velvet Underground feedback and an unusually witty epigram that just about sums up the Spirit of '67: Show me that I'm everywhere, <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> home for tea." [...] Rodriguez recognises the timing of the song's release on its public perception. While he notes that the recording was [...] "positively anarchic" [...] in mid-1967, by 1969, when it received widespread release, the song was [...] "slightly less groundbreaking and a little more reactionary to the psychedelic movement that the band itself had helped popularize".|$|E
500|$|Although Yellow Submarine has {{attained}} {{the status}} of a classic children's animated film, many Beatles biographers consider the band's post-Sgt. Pepper 1967 recordings to be substandard work. Among these authors, Mark Hertsgaard cites Martin's view that the soundtrack album was made up of [...] "bottom of the barrel" [...] material and dismisses [...] "It's All Too Much" [...] as [...] "little more than formless shrieking". Ian MacDonald also holds the track in low regard, describing it as a [...] "protracted exercise in drug-mesmerised G-pedal monotony". Discussing the lyrics, particularly the line [...] "Show me that I'm everywhere, <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> home for tea", MacDonald considers the song to be [...] "the locus classicus of English psychedelia" [...] and he comments that in Britain, unlike in America, [...] "tradition, nature, and the child's-eye-view were the things which sprang most readily to the LSD-heightened Anglo-Saxon mind." [...] Author and journalist Graham Reid highlights the same line as being the British equivalent of [...] "Tune in, turn on, drop out", the phrase coined by Timothy Leary that came to define the American psychedelic experience.|$|E

5000|$|When I {{started the}} show I said, [...] "If it <b>gets</b> <b>me</b> {{away from my}} actual skateboarding fans <b>and</b> <b>gets</b> <b>me</b> away from skateboarding, then I'm {{not going to do}} the show anymore." [...] That's why our third season was only six episodes; we cut it in half. I was, like, [...] "I can't do it anymore! It's going to be more {{detrimental}} to my career than positive." [...] We just quit. We stopped it.|$|R
500|$|After [...] "Freakshow" [...] is Blackouts eight track, [...] "Toy Soldier", a R and dance-pop song {{reminiscent}} of Destiny's Child's song [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] (2004) that showcases a military drumroll and Spears singing about needing a new lover. In [...] "Hot as Ice", a R song featuring background vocals by T-Pain, she sings {{in a higher}} register: [...] "I'm just a girl {{with the ability to}} drive a man crazy / Make him call me 'mama', make him my new baby." [...] Blackouts tenth track [...] "Ooh Ooh Baby" [...] contains a flamenco guitar and blends the beat from Gary Glitter's [...] "Rock and Roll" [...] (1972) and the melody of The Turtles' [...] "Happy Together" [...] (1967). In the lyrics, she sings to a lover [...] "Touch me and I come alive / I can feel you on my lips / I can feel you deep inside". Kara DioGuardi said she was inspired by the relationship between Spears and her first son in the studio, saying: [...] "I would look at the two of them, the way {{they looked at each other}} and the way she would hold the baby. It kind of struck me as interesting. At times it'd be about a kid at times about a lover." [...] "Perfect Lover", an R song, has a propulsive, clattery belly-dance beat in which Spears sings lyrics such as [...] "Tick-tock / Tick-tock / Come <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> while I'm hot". The twelfth track is [...] "Why Should I Be Sad", a midtempo R song directed to her ex-husband Kevin Federline. One of the bonus tracks, [...] "Everybody", samples Eurythmics' [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" [...] (1983). It features Spears singing about the dancefloor in a breathy lower register.|$|E
500|$|Derrickson and Marvel had {{originally}} discussed him writing the film alongside his Sinister co-writer C. Robert Cargill, with Derrickson also directing, but Marvel {{felt that they}} would not be able to reach their intended release date of July 2016 if Derrickson filled both roles. When Derrickson was chosen as director, Marvel passed on Cargill as an individual writer, with Jon Spaihts hired to rewrite the script instead. Spaihts, a big fan of Doctor Strange as a child, had started [...] "pestering" [...] Marvel as soon as he read reports of the company searching for a director for the film. This eventually led to him meeting with the studio, before they actually began looking for writers for the film. Spaihts said that they talked [...] "all afternoon, and the fit was right", but he received a call from Marvel several days later saying that they were not completely sure they wanted to take the film in the same direction as Spaihts, and were going to look at other writers. Spaihts told his agent to not [...] "take that answer. Call them back, tell them there’s a lot of right answers, <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> back in the room", and after talking with Marvel for [...] "another three or four hours" [...] he was given the job. Marvel never seriously looked at any other writer for the film. Derrickson was already hired when Spaihts joined, and the pair spent several months working on the film's story with Feige and executive producer Stephen Broussard. They started writing the film from the beginning, and initially were unsure whether it would be an origin story, or if it would begin with Strange already as a [...] "fully-formed" [...] sorcerer. Spaihts ultimately felt that [...] "the origin story of this character, as depicted in the comics, is so operatic and beautiful, and so tragic and epic in its sweep, that it was unavoidable. We had to tell that story, and tell our best version of it." [...] Elements from Spaihts' early drafts that he later stated were still in the final film include many of the film's set pieces, such as the climactic battle, which came straight from Derrickson, as well as [...] "little things" [...] from Spaihts, [...] "like a bandaged hand running down a row of prayer bells in a Nepalese temple." [...] Derrickson wanted Nightmare to be the film's antagonist, along with the concept of [...] "nightmares themselves as being a dimension", but Feige felt [...] "getting across the idea of the Dream Dimension as another dimension" [...] would have been challenging alongside everything else that the film introduces. Dormammu, [...] "the most present villain in the comics", became the film's main villain.|$|E

2500|$|Neither Clark nor Lucas had full {{confidence}} in either their superiors or the operational plan.

2500|$|During the Test, former South African opening batsman Barry Richards bemoaned {{the lack}} of fight in the England team, commenting that [...] "...it puzzles me why {{the new breed of}} England batsmen are failing to stamp their {{authority}} on an innings.

[...] meanwhile, in The Guardian, Mike Selvey praised the South African seamers, and Scyld Berry singled out Fanie De Villiers' bowling on the second day as the turning point of the match, and the above commentators pointed out England's lack of success at the home of cricket and questioned {{the lack of}} a left-handed batsman in the eleven.|$|E
