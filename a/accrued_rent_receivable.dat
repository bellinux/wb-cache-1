60|$|It is here worth observation, {{that these}} corrupt {{proceedings}} of the prince have, {{in the opinion of}} several learned men, given rise to two customs, which are a long time grown to have the force of laws. For, first the successors of this King, continuing the custom of seizing on the <b>accruing</b> <b>rents</b> in the vacancy of sees and abbeys, it grew in process of time to be exacted as a right, or acknowledgment to the King as founder; whence the revenues of vacant bishoprics belong at this day to the crown. The second custom had an original not unlike. Several persons, to avoid the persecutions of the King's informers, and other instruments of oppression, withdrew themselves and their effects to foreign countries; upon which the King issued a proclamation, forbidding all men to leave the kingdom without his licence; from whence, in the judgment of the same authors, the writ ne exeat regno had its beginning.|$|R
50|$|A state bank, {{which was}} a member of the Federal Reserve System, upon realizing that it was not feasible, because of various state and federal regulations, for it to finance by {{conventional}} mortgage and other financing a building under construction for its headquarters and principal banking facility, entered into sale-and-leaseback agreements by which petitioner took title to the building and leased it back to the bank for long-term use, petitioner obtaining both a construction loan and permanent mortgage financing. The bank is obligated to pay rent equal to the principal and interest payments on petitioner's mortgage and has an option to repurchase the building at various times at prices equal to the then unpaid balance of petitioner's mortgage and initial $500,000 investment. On its federal income tax return for the year in which the building was completed and the bank took possession, petitioner <b>accrued</b> <b>rent</b> from the bank and claimed as deductions depreciation on the building, interest on its construction loan and mortgage, and other expenses related to the sale-and-leaseback transaction.|$|R

40|$|This paper uses a {{numerical}} {{general equilibrium model}} to examine the quantitative importance of pre-existing factor tax distortions for the welfare effects of restrictive trade policies in economies with and without market power in trade. We analyze tariffs, non-auctioned import quotas (with <b>rents</b> <b>accruing</b> to domestic firms) and voluntary export restraints (with <b>rents</b> <b>accruing</b> to foreign firms). We find that allowing for interactions with pre-existing taxes can greatly magnify the overall costs of these policies - possibly by over several hundred percent! In the case of import tariffs, much of this additional cost can be offset if the tariff revenues are used to reduce other distortionary taxes. Indeed the cost discrepancy between revenue-neutral tariffs and import quotas is dramatic at modest levels of import reduction, but declines to zero as these policies become prohibitive. We find that the optimal tariff for a country with market power in trade is greatly reduced, and possibly to zero, unless tariff revenues finance cuts in other distorting taxes. The proportionate increase in costs due to pre-existing taxes is much smaller under voluntary export restraints than under import quotas when costs are measured by domestic welfare losses, but not when measured by world welfare losses. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} of improved methods for characterizing crop yield densities {{has experienced a}} recent surge in activity {{due in part to}} the central role played by crop insurance in the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000 (estimates of yield densities are required for the determination of insurance premium rates). Nonparametric kernel methods have been successfully used to model yield densities; however, traditional kernel methods do not handle the presence of categorical data in a satisfactory manner and have therefore tended to be applied on a county-by-county basis. By utilizing recently developed kernel methods that admit mixed data types, we are able to model the yield density jointly across counties, leading to substantial finite sample efficiency gains. Findings show that when we allow insurance companies to strategically reinsure with the government based on this novel approach they <b>accrue</b> significant <b>rents.</b> discrete data, insurance rating, kernel estimation, yield distributions, Risk and Uncertainty,...|$|R

In turn, using an applied computable general equilibrium model, we compare the long term impact of raising domestic competition with that of reducing import tariffs. Simulation results suggest that Lebanon would largely benefit from the reduction of anti-competitive practices. By way of comparison, reducing tariffs would be structurally less effective in terms of raising investment opportunities and real wages, which, in the long run, would inevitably affect economic growth. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{continuity}} with the classical liberal tradition, geolibertarians contend that land {{is an independent}} factor of production, {{that it is the}} common inheritance of all humankind, and that the justice of private property is derived from an individual's right to the fruits of his or her labor. Since land, by economic definition, is not the product of human labor, its ownership cannot be justified by appealing to natural human rights. Thus, geolibertarians recognize the individual civil right to secure exclusive possession of land (land tenure) only on the condition that, if the land has <b>accrued</b> economic <b>rent,</b> its full rental value be paid to the community deprived of equal access. This non-distortionary system of taxation, it is argued, has the effects of returning the value that belongs to all members of society and encouraging landholders to use only as much land as they need, leaving unneeded land for others to occupy, use and develop.|$|R

Examining whether these variables are cointegrated shows {{the extent to which the}} claims are true. Further, examining returns rather than directly examining asset price movements gives us a precise test, unencumbered by expectations hypotheses.

30|$|Of course, {{there are}} other {{cases in which the}} {{elasticity}} of substitution may be high; for example, labor may substitute reasonably well for specific production techniques. In such instances, it is unclear whether total surplus is higher when the buyer requires specific production techniques or when the farmer chooses them. Importantly, regardless of the effect on total surplus, in either case the information <b>rents</b> <b>accruing</b> to some farmers will decline and returns to the buyer will increase. Consequently, our analysis contributes to the property rights literature by providing a strong argument for integration; the buyer’s profits are higher when she controls material inputs than when she does not in this framework.|$|R

Separating firm performance into firm-specific (Skill) and exogenous (Luck) components, I find that pay sensitivity to Luck increases with blockholder turnover, whereas pay sensitivity to Skill increases with blockholding size. Furthermore, when blockholder turnover is higher, CEO pay increases more with positive Luck but does not decrease as much with negative Luck; also, excess CEO compensation is larger. Thus, the <b>rent</b> <b>accruing</b> to CEOs via asymmetric pay sensitivity to Luck is partly explained by short investment horizons of large shareholders.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} optimal urban structure which combines data from hedonic regressions with {{a version of the}} assignment model.

The data for these are also obtained from the hedonic regressions. All of the methodology (hedonic regressions, demand estimations, linear assignment optimizations) is currently operational. The usefulness of the approach is further underscored by the ability to track welfare effects over space and over time; surpluses <b>accruing</b> to each <b>renter</b> and owner group (maximum willingness to pay less actual price paid) are computed from the dual of the optimization. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on two {{questions}} {{in the debate over}} motor carrier regulation.

Second, if there were rents, what was their incidence: were they received by owners of trucking firms, dissipated through higher costs, or captured by the Teamsters Union? Data on share price responses to deregulaton announcements reveal declines in expected profits of 8 - 19 % of total firm value.

40|$|The {{application}} of index numbers to disaggregated Korean footwear exports during 1974 - 85 suggests that binding voluntary export restraints (VERs) led to significant price increases {{but not to}} the upgrading of quality predicted in earlier theoretical analyses. The results in this paper were derived from exporters rather than importers data. Drawing its comparisons from multilateral indices, the paper finds that the price of Korean footwear exports to the United States rose significantly in the years when the VERs were binding.

30|$|To ease interpretation, all regressors are centred {{around their}} sample averages, so that π 1 can be {{interpreted}} as the average unexplained gender pay gap in the full sample. The coefficients of main interest are π 2 and π 3, where π 2 gives the effect of strong product market competition on males’ wages, and π 3 is the difference in the competition effect across the sexes. We expect strong competition to depress the overall <b>rents</b> <b>accruing</b> and thus workers’ wages in general. Moreover, strong competition should also confine employers’ ability to discriminate against women by sharing rents disproportionately with male workers (cf. Black and Strahan [2001]). Hence, we expect π 2 to have a negative sign and π 3 to have a positive sign, the latter indicating that strong competition reduces the gender pay gap by inducing a smaller adverse effect on females’ compared to males’ wages.|$|R

40|$|Optimal {{pollution}} control {{is an important}} challenge for sustainable development with three distinct cases. First, the situation where nature's assimilative capacity is completely destroyed involves normative problems that require further research. Second, environmental restoration with initial pollution above the steady-state stock requires an economy to initially allocate a relatively high share of its resources to cleaning-up activities. In return, this generally results in an intertemporally efficient development path that is both environmentally and economically sustainable. Third, optimal trajectories in situations with initial stocks of pollution below the long-term optimum generally imply an increase in pollution and a decline of optimal consumption. In this case, the investment of the environmental <b>rents</b> <b>accruing</b> from nature's assimilative capacity into man-made capital is required in analogy to the famous Hartwick rule to maintain a constant flow of instantaneous welfare.

40|$|This study {{provides}} a theoretical {{background for the}} firm-level analysis on the distributional effects of commodity promotion programs. The conceptual basis {{of this approach is}} that firms differ due to differences in possessing endowments of fixed factors, and net returns to firms can be viewed as <b>rents</b> <b>accruing</b> to these factors. Therefore, the marginal return from an increase in demand due to a successful generic promotion programs may not be the same across firms because firms {{do not have the same}} level of fixed factors. The result of our analysis indicates that producers may not equally benefit from the collectively funded programs. Our marginal profit analysis indicates that a producer-financed promotion program may have greater benefits for producers with more endowed fixed factors than those with less endowed fixed factors.

50|$|In {{its early}} days, the {{management}} of the theatre, and censorship of its performances, was entrusted to a senior knight, known as the Protettore. The first recorded impresario was Melchiorre Prevvost Lanarelli in 1736, and the last Giovanni Le Brun in 1866. From 1768 to 1770 the impresario was a woman, Natala Farrugia. In setting up the theatre, Grand Master de Vilhena set the rent to be paid by the impresario at 320 scudi per annum, of which 80 <b>accrued</b> for <b>rent</b> from Easter to August, 120 for autumn, and another 120 scudi from Christmas to Carnival. When dances or veglioni (masked ball) were held in the theatre, the pit was raised by a scaffolding {{to the level of the}} stage. On August 22, 1778, regulations were passed for the lighting of the theatre and corridors on such occasions, with the shading of lights, in any manner, being prohibited. In 1778, to avoid scandal, theatre companies were prohibited from sleeping in the boxes of the theatre. This was a practice which was common during that time. A few years later, in 1783, the Teatro Pubblico underwent considerable modification and decoration, based on a design by the Roman architect, Natale Marini. A model was displayed before the inquisitor and many knights, and the model was so admired that the Commissioners of the Foundation of the Theatre decided to add a further two louis, as a bonus to Marini’s invoice of 49 scudi.|$|R
30|$|This view is in {{contrast}} to the human capital theory (HCT) (Becker 1962) which argues that any training can be regarded as either firm-specific (i.e. of no use in other firms), or general (i.e. of use in many other firms), and proclaims that inefficiencies in training investment do not exist. According to HCT, in perfect labor markets workers would generally incur investments in general training, because they could reap the return in the form of market wages fully reflecting the increase in productivity due to training. There would be no <b>rent</b> <b>accruing</b> to the employer-side and, hence, no externalities in case of labor turnover. In contrast, specific investments are in principle undertaken by employers according to HCT. However, as separation of workers and employers after specific training would be associated with a loss for the investing firm, Becker (1962) predicts the latter to share costs and returns with trainees in order to safeguard against potential turnover.|$|R
