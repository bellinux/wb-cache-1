But he {{was by no means}} {{satisfied}} of the legality of the last act he had aided and abetted, although he admitted its rude justice, and felt he would have done so again. A fear of this, and an instinct that he might be led into further complications if he continued to identify himself with Clinch and Rawlins; {{the fact that they had}} professedly abandoned their quest, and that it was really supplanted by the presence of an <b>authorized</b> <b>party</b> whom they had already come in conflict with--all this urged him to remain behind. On the other hand, the apparent desertion of his comrades at the last moment was opposed both to his sense of honor and the liking he had taken to them. But he reflected that he had already shown his active partisanship, that he could be of little service to them at Wild Cat Station, and would be only increasing the distance from his home; and above all, an impatient longing for independent action finally decided him.

30|$|The quality {{standard}} of integrity of information technology (IT) systems aims to guarantee that the information is modified and destroyed only by <b>authorized</b> <b>parties,</b> is modified and destroyed only in authorized ways, and {{is assumed to be}} authentic, (i.e., <b>authorized</b> <b>parties</b> can be verified), and any change of information cannot be repudiated (i.e., cannot be denied by the <b>authorized</b> changing <b>party).</b> There exist several measures to provide end-to-end data integrity. These measures include installation of antivirus programs, establishing authenticity and non-repudiation protocols, applying “check-sum” procedures, and installation of system and data recovery utility software programs. Malware is a common root cause of data corruption, and it can cause intentional or unintentional loss of data integrity. A virus also alters files and renders an information system unusable. A “check-sum” procedure can be used to detect and correct possible data corruption. Other programs can repair the corrupted file automatically, depending on the level of corruption. In more extreme cases, when data seems to be uncorrectable, one can apply automatic restoration from backups.|$|R

This was made possible in 2003 and there are various Income Tax Act (ITA) requirements to allow this to take place. The new registered asset could result in provincial benefits being cut off. In many cases a court application to have someone appointed guardian of the child’s property and person {{would be necessary to}} provide a legally <b>authorized</b> <b>party</b> to manage the asset if the child is deemed incompetent to do so.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} a problem where mutually untrusting curators possess portions of a vertically partitioned database containing {{information about a}} set of individuals. The goal is to enable an <b>authorized</b> <b>party</b> to obtain aggregate (statistical) information from the database while protecting {{the privacy of the}} individuals, which we formalize using Differential Privacy. This process can be facilitated by an untrusted server that provides storage and processing services but should not learn anything about the database. This work describes a data release mech-anism that employs Post Randomization (PRAM), encryption and random sampling to maintain privacy, while allowing the <b>authorized</b> <b>party</b> to conduct an accurate statistical analysis of the data. Encryption ensures that the storage server obtains no information about the database, while PRAM and sampling ensures individual privacy is maintained against the <b>authorized</b> <b>party.</b> We characterize how much the composition of random sampling with PRAM increases the differential privacy of system compared to using PRAM alone. We also analyze the statistical utility of our system, by bounding the estimation error — the expected ` 2 -norm error between the true empirical distribution and the estimated distribution — {{as a function of the}} number of samples, PRAM noise, and other system parameters. Our analysis shows a tradeoff between increasing PRAM noise versus decreasing the number of samples to maintain a desired level of privacy, and we determine the optimal number of samples that balances this tradeoff and maximizes the utility. In experimental simulations with the UCI “Adult Data Set ” and with synthetically generated data, we confirm that the theoretically predicted optimal number of samples indeed achieves close to the minimal empirical error, and that our analytical error bounds match well with the empirical results.

40|$|Abstract. As {{the global}} society becomes more {{interconnected}} and more privacy-conscious, communication protocols must balance access control with protecting participants ’ privacy. A common current scenario involves an <b>authorized</b> <b>party</b> (client) {{who needs to}} retrieve sensitive information held by another party (server) such that: (1) the former only gets the information {{for which it is}} duly authorized, (2) the latter does not learn what information information is retrieved. To address this scenario, in this paper, we introduce and explore the concept of Privacy-preserving Policy-based Information Transfer (PPIT). We construct three PPIT schemes based, respectively, on: RSA, Schnorr and IBE techniques. We then investigate various performance improvements and demonstrate the practicality of proposed PPIT schemes. ...|$|E
