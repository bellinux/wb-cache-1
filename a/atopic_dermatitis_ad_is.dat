By targeting the transcription factor, GATA3, of the Th2 pathway, with DNAzyme {{it may be possible}} to negate the inflammation. The safety and efficacy of SB010, a novel 10-23 DNAzyme was evaluated, and found to have the ability to cleave and inactivate GATA3 messenger RNA in phase IIa clinical trials. Treatment with SB010 significantly offset both late and early asthmatic responses after allergen aggravation in male patients with allergic asthma.The transcription factor GATA-3 is also an interesting target, of the DNAzyme topical formulation SB012, for a novel therapeutic strategy in ulcerative colitis (UC). UC is an idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases defined by chronically relapsing inflammations of the gastrointestinal tract, and characterized by a superficial, continuous mucosal inflammation, which predominantly affects the large intestine. Patients that do not effectively respond to current UC treatment strategies exhibit serious drawbacks one of which may lead to colorectal surgery, and can result in a severely compromised quality of life. Thus, patients with moderate or severe UC may significantly benefit from these new therapeutic alternatives, of which SB012 is in phase I clinical trials. <b>Atopic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> (<b>AD)</b> <b>is</b> a chronic inflammatory skin disorder, in which patients suffer from eczema, often severe pruritus on the affected skin, as well as complications and secondary infections.

The topical DNAzyme SB011 is currently in phase II clinical trials.DNAzyme research for the treatment of cancer is also underway. The development of a 10-23 DNAzyme that can block the expression of IGF-I (Insulin-like growth factor I, a contributor to normal cell growth as well as tumorigenesis) by targeting its mRNA could be useful for blocking the secretion of IGF-I from prostate storm primary cells ultimately inhibiting prostate tumor development. Additionally, with this treatment it is expected that hepatic metastasis would also be inhibited, via the inhibition of IGF-I in the liver (the major source of serum IGF-I).|$|E

However, despite their significant efforts to do so, patients were eventually forced to return to and rely on conventional medicines because of their efficacy in alleviating and treating symptoms. These findings are discussed in relation to the sociological literature on consumerism, risk and reflexivity in health.
