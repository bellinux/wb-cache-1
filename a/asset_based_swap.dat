50|$|The 1998 National Electricity Code did {{not allow}} the ACCC to roll forward {{automatically}} {{the value of the}} regulatory <b>asset</b> <b>base</b> from one regulatory period to the next (in contrast to the 1997 National Third Party Access Code for Natural Gas Pipeline Systems). however, under both the current National Electricity Rules and National Gas Rules, the regulatory <b>asset</b> <b>base</b> is locked-in using the <b>asset</b> <b>base</b> roll forward equation below. The telecommunications regime has also been amended from 1 January 2011 to allow the ACCC to make access determinations that include 'fixed principles'. The amendment will allow the ACCC to lock-in the value of the <b>asset</b> <b>base</b> across regulatory periods.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to conduct a {{comparative}} analysis between <b>asset</b> <b>based</b> and <b>asset</b> backed sukuk structures from shariah perspective. The study is also intended to find out the reasons why <b>asset</b> <b>based</b> sukuk structure is still dominant in the market despite the critics that have been raised by many scholars since 2008. The two structures are compared in their technical and commercial features using library/literatures based methodology, which is a qualitative approach. It is found that asset backed sukuk structure is more compliant to shariah both in form and substance than <b>asset</b> <b>based</b> structure. This study also found that there are three categories of reasons that can explain why <b>asset</b> <b>based</b> sukuk structure is still dominant in the market up to 2012 namely shariah, legal framework and market demand. The study is intended to increase public awareness in the importance of compliancy to shariah not only in the form but also in substance. This study is also expected to benefit regulators in the sense that they should amend some of their regulatory frameworks to push the sukuk market players to move towards asset backed structure...|$|R
