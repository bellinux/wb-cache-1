25|$|In 1996, Thompson was re-elected (for {{the term}} ending January 3, 2003) with 61% of the vote, {{defeating}} Democratic attorney Houston Gordon of Covington, Tennessee, even <b>as</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> and running mate Al Gore narrowly carried {{the state by}} less than three percentage points {{on their way to}} re-election. During this campaign, Mike Long served as Thompson's chief speechwriter. The GOP continues to hold the seat, as it was won by former Tennessee Governor and Secretary of Education Lamar Alexander in 2002.

25|$|Given his {{previous}} experience as Minister of Foreign Affairs and his prestige as an internationally famous sociologist, he was respected {{on the world}} scene, building friendships with such leaders <b>as</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> and Ernesto Zedillo. Although he was respected abroad, in Brazil he had problems gaining support in Congress for government priorities and among people in general. As a result, major reforms planned by the executive branch, such as changes in the tax system and to social security, were only partially approved and only after long discussion. Although he claiming to still support social democracy, his economic policies led {{people on the left}} to identify him with neoliberalism and right-wing politics, terms that often carry a very negative connotation in Latin American political debate and academic circles.|$|E
25|$|Obama's {{developing}} presidential {{agenda was}} divided into {{domestic and foreign policy}} issues. In most cases, this agenda involved addressing crises already underway. His principal strategic decisions concerned how quickly to move bills through Congress. Some of his advisors suggested moving quickly, as Franklin D. Roosevelt did in 1933, under the belief that a more moderate approach would waste valuable time early in his presidency, when his political capital will be strongest. Others suggested moving more slowly, <b>as</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> did before his attempt to enact a national healthcare program, based on the notion that rapid change could quickly wear down any bipartisan consensus. He was expected, in any case, to issue a series of executive orders within days of his inauguration, including a reversal of Bush-era executive orders restricting funding to family planning (including abortion) services and stem-cell research. There was also a possibility that a new cabinet level advisory post would be created overseeing the Department of Energy, Department of the Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{commissioned}} in 2002 by ITV's head of drama Nick Elliott, who encouraged Peter Morgan {{to put aside}} any other projects and start work on a script as soon as possible. Granada was initially sceptical of producing it; the company's executive chairman and chief executive—Charles Allen and Simon Shaps respectively—believed that Blair {{would be forced to}} resign as Prime Minister over the impending war in Iraq, consequently leaving the story outdated. The project was believed to be [...] "too cerebral" [...] and attempts were made to persuade Morgan to develop a television series to replace Cold Feet, another Granada production. John Whiston and Andy Harries convinced Allen and Shaps otherwise, citing Granada's history of producing ground-breaking drama and film as reasons for why The Deal should be made. ITV's director of channels, David Liddiment, who supported the production, resigned in December 2002 and was replaced by Nigel Pickard, who shared the concerns of Allen and Shaps. Peter Morgan wrote his first script draft in the three weeks preceding Christmas 2002. Recent events such as the 2001 foot and mouth outbreak and the contention surrounding the September Dossier made him believe that the perceived adversity between Brown and Blair was no longer in the public consciousness. His opinion was changed when he watched the 2002 Labour Party Conference and saw a [...] "thunderous expression" [...] on Brown's face <b>as</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> praised Blair in his speech; Morgan realised that the rivalry was not over. This draft was extremely sympathetic to Brown, focusing on what Morgan called [...] "Gordon's heartbreak". Subsequent rewrites toned down this approach, though Brown still remained the [...] "main character".|$|E

2500|$|Having long {{described}} himself as a social democrat, a Marxist, and an anti-totalitarian, he began to break with the established political left after what he called the [...] "tepid reaction" [...] of the Western left to the Satanic Verses controversy, followed by the left's embrace of Bill Clinton and the antiwar movement's opposition to NATO intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1990s. His support of the Iraq War separated him further. His writings include critiques of public figures such <b>as</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton,</b> Henry Kissinger, Mother Teresa and Diana, Princess of Wales.

2500|$|Hart, from Colorado, was a {{more serious}} threat to Mondale, and after winning several early {{primaries}} {{it looked as if}} he might take the nomination away from Mondale. Hart finished a surprising second in the Iowa caucuses, with 16.5% of the vote. This established him as the main rival to Mondale, effectively eliminating John Glenn, Ernest Hollings and Alan Cranston as alternatives. Hart criticized Mondale as an [...] "old-fashioned" [...] New Deal Democrat who symbolized [...] "failed policies" [...] of the past. [...] Hart positioned himself (just <b>as</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> would eight years later) as a younger, fresher, and more moderate Democrat who could appeal to younger voters. [...] He emerged as a formidable candidate, winning the key New Hampshire, Ohio, and California primaries as well as several others, especially in the West. [...] However, Hart could not overcome Mondale's financial and organizational advantages, especially among labor union leaders in the Midwest and industrial Northeast.|$|E

2500|$|... 21st century {{conservative}} Democrats {{are similar}} to liberal Republican counterparts, in that both became political minorities after their respective political parties underwent a major political realignment which began to gain speed in 1964. Prior to 1964, both parties had their liberal, moderate, and conservative wings, each of them influential in both parties; President Franklin D. Roosevelt had proposed a realignment of the parties in the 1940s, though the trends which brought it about did not accelerate until two decades later. During this period, conservative Democrats formed the Democratic half of the conservative coalition. After 1964, the conservative wing assumed a greater presence in the Republican Party, although it did not become the mainstay of the party until the nomination of Ronald Reagan in 1980. The Democratic Party retained its conservative wing through the 1970s {{with the help of}} urban machine politics. This political realignment was mostly complete by 1980. After 1980, the Republicans became a mostly right-wing party, with conservative leaders such as Newt Gingrich, Trent Lott, and Tom DeLay, while the Democrats, while keeping their left wing intact with such Senators as Ted Kennedy, Christopher Dodd, and Paul Sarbanes, grew a substantial moderate wing in the 1990s in place of their old conservative wing, with leaders such <b>as</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton,</b> Al Gore, and Evan Bayh. In 2008, the Democrats nominated Barack Obama for President; he was the first nominee since 1988 that was {{not a member of the}} moderate Democratic Leadership Council.|$|E
