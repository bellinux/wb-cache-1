5|$|Each {{party in}} a coevolutionary {{relationship}} exerts selective pressures on the other, thereby affecting each other's evolution. Coevolution includes many forms of mutualism, host-parasite, and predator-prey relationships between species, as well as competition within or between species. In many cases, the selective pressures drive an evolutionary arms race between the species involved. Pairwise or specific coevolution, between exactly two species, {{is not the only}} possibility; in guild or diffuse coevolution, several species may evolve <b>a</b> <b>trait</b> in reciprocity with <b>a</b> <b>trait</b> in another species, as has happened between the flowering plants and pollinating insects such as bees, flies, and beetles.|$|E

40|$|We {{critically}} {{review the}} main approaches for standardizing and comparing selection differentials and gradients among traits, populations, and species and assess their differential merits. In particular, we {{explain why the}} most widespread approach to standardizing selection, which measures selection differentials in units of <b>a</b> <b>trait’s</b> phenotypic standard deviation, is less appropriate for characterizing the strengths of natural selection in wild populations. In contrast, an alternative standardization approach that uses <b>a</b> <b>trait’s</b> phenotypic mean {{in addition to its}} standard deviation results in another dimensionless measure: the mean-standardized selection gradient. This measure offers some key benefits over alternative approaches, such as ease of interpretation, independence of <b>a</b> <b>trait’s</b> variance, and the natural interplay of ecological and evolutionary dynamics, and yet it remains rarely used by evolutionary biologists. We explain how the more routine application of this measure will facilitate comparisons of selection strengths in the wild among traits, populations, and species...|$|R

5|$|Selection can be {{classified}} in several different ways, such as by its effect on <b>a</b> <b>trait,</b> on genetic diversity, by the life cycle stage where it acts, by the unit of selection, or by the resource being competed for.|$|E
5|$|Selection has {{different}} effects on traits. Stabilizing selection acts to hold <b>a</b> <b>trait</b> at a stable optimum, {{and in the}} simplest case all deviations from this optimum are selectively disadvantageous. Directional selection favours extreme values of <b>a</b> <b>trait.</b> The uncommon disruptive selection also acts during transition periods when the current mode is sub-optimal, but alters the trait {{in more than one}} direction. In particular, if the trait is quantitative and univariate then both higher and lower trait levels are favoured. Disruptive selection can be a precursor to speciation.|$|E

5|$|Additional traits {{shared with}} other {{prosimian}} primates (strepsirrhine primates and tarsiers) include a bicornuate (two-horned) uterus and epitheliochorial placentation. Because their thumbs are only pseudo-opposable, making their movement less {{independent of the}} other fingers, their hands are less than perfect at grasping and manipulating objects. On their feet, they have a widely abducted hallux (first toe) which facilitates the grasping of tree limbs. A common misconception is that lemurs have a prehensile tail, <b>a</b> <b>trait</b> found only in New World monkeys, particularly atelids, among primates. Lemurs also rely heavily on their sense of smell, <b>a</b> <b>trait</b> shared with most other mammals and early primates, {{but not with the}} visually oriented higher primates.

50|$|<b>A</b> {{quantitative}} <b>trait</b> locus (QTL) {{refers to}} a suite of genes that controls <b>a</b> quantitative <b>trait.</b> <b>A</b> quantitative <b>trait</b> {{is one that is}} influenced by several different genes as opposed to just one or two. QTLs are analyzed using Qst. Qst looks at the relatedness of the traits in focus. In the case of QTLs, clines are analyzed by Qst. A cline (biology) is a change in allele frequency across a geographical distance. This change in allele frequency causes a series of intermediate varying phenotypes that when associated with certain environmental conditions can indicate selection. This selection causes local adaptation, but high gene flow is still expected to be present along the cline.|$|R

5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{within a}} population for <b>a</b> <b>trait</b> that can vary across {{a range of}} values, such as height, can be categorised into three different types. The first is directional selection, which is a shift in the average value of <b>a</b> <b>trait</b> over time—for example, organisms slowly getting taller. Secondly, disruptive selection is selection for extreme trait values and often results in two different values becoming most common, with selection against the average value. This would be when either short or tall organisms had an advantage, but not those of medium height. Finally, in stabilising selection there is selection against extreme trait values on both ends, which causes a decrease in variance around the average value and less diversity. This would, for example, cause organisms to slowly become all the same height.|$|E

5|$|The {{types of}} {{coevolution}} listed {{so far have}} been described as if they operated pairwise (also called specific coevolution), in which traits of one species have evolved in direct response to traits of a second species, and vice versa. This is not always the case. Another evolutionary mode arises where evolution is still reciprocal, but is among a group of species rather than exactly two. This is called guild or diffuse coevolution. For instance, <b>a</b> <b>trait</b> in several species of flowering plant, such as offering its nectar {{at the end of a}} long tube, can coevolve with <b>a</b> <b>trait</b> in one or several species of pollinating insects, such as a long proboscis. More generally, flowering plants are pollinated by insects from different families including bees, flies, and beetles, all of which form a broad guild of pollinators which respond to the nectar or pollen produced by flowers.|$|E
