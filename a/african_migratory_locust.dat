40|$|It is {{just over}} 100 {{years since the}} {{chemical}} control of locusts began in South Africa when sodium arsenite dust was first applied by hand to Red Locust hopper bands and roosting swarms in Natal (Anonymous, 1906). Although our knowledge of locust outbreak dynamics, insecticide technology, application techniques and intervention strategies has made great advances, locusts remain a serious problem. Outbreaks of Brown, <b>African</b> <b>Migratory</b> and Red <b>Locust</b> still threaten sustainable agricultural production in southern Africa. Due to insufficient early warning and limited operational capacity, Brown Locust outbreaks are only contained after emergency campaigns have been launched. Such a curative control response involves vast expenditure, high insecticide usage and increased risk of environmental contamination. This paper briefly describes the biology and outbreak dynamics of the four species of plague locust occurring in southern Africa and focuses on the Brown Locust â€“ a species of great economic importance for the SADC Region. The status of the Brown Locust in South Africa, the advances made, the current control strategy and operational tactics are highlighted. Whether major locust upsurges can in fact be effectively managed and locust control re-inforced, will be reviewed...|$|R

50|$|There {{was a major}} {{plague of}} the <b>African</b> <b>migratory</b> <b>locust</b> from 1891 to 1903, {{followed}} by one that lasted from 1928 to 1941. For many years after that, the <b>African</b> <b>migratory</b> <b>locust</b> was in recession, which perhaps lulled the authorities into {{a false sense of}} security. The Sahel region experienced several years of drought in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The rains and more normal weather returned in 1984, providing ideal conditions for the locusts to breed abundantly. As well as the <b>African</b> <b>migratory</b> <b>locust,</b> the Senegalese grasshopper, the red locust, the brown locust and the desert locust were flourishing {{in various parts of the}} continent at the same time. The Desert Locust Control Organisation of East Africa remained an effective body, but elsewhere little monitoring was done, with civil wars in Chad and the Central African Republic hindering the detection of outbreaks. In many countries, there were few resources to deal with any outbreaks that were discovered. This plague lasted until 1986.|$|E
5000|$|The International <b>African</b> <b>Migratory</b> <b>Locust</b> Organization (OICMA) {{was founded}} in 1955. Its aim was to [...] "exercise {{continuous}} surveillance and preventive control of the <b>African</b> <b>migratory</b> <b>locust</b> in the outbreak area on the River Niger, destroy concentrations of the locust, carry out research and develop means of control." [...] This control was effective, and increasing dryland farming and better monitoring in Mali changed {{the character of the}} outbreak area such that by the 1980s, the insect's behaviour was thought to be more like that of a solitary grasshopper than a gregarious locust. OICMA was dissolved in 1986.|$|E

50|$|The Oriental {{migratory locust}} is {{slightly}} {{smaller than the}} <b>African</b> <b>migratory</b> <b>locust.</b> It can exist in two phases, solitary and gregarious. The solitary adults are either green or brown, but as the insects become more crowded together, then brown individuals predominate. The nymphs or hoppers are greyish-brown when they first hatch but their colour changes to either green or brown as they grow, with brown being more common in dry conditions. When their densities increase and they begin to form hopper bands, the colour becomes orangeish-brown or reddish-brown, with black markings.|$|E
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>migratory</b> <b>locust</b> has two phases, {{a solitary}} one, where the insects behave independently, and a gregarious phase where they gather {{together}} {{and act as}} a cohesive unit. Adult insects differ morphologically between the two phases; solitary insects have an arched prothorax, the foremost segment of the thorax, and are either green or brown, darkening in colour as they mature (especially the abdomen of the female). Gregarious insects have a flatter prothorax and are a pale tan or a greyish colour with dark markings. As they mature they become duller in appearance and the males may become more yellowish.|$|E

50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>migratory</b> <b>locust</b> {{exists in}} its solitary form {{in many parts}} of Africa and its {{development}} is then similar to that of other grasshopper species. When the eggs hatch in extremely close proximity to each other, the first instar hoppers become attracted to each other and begin to form bands that move in synchrony. The band moves as a cohesive unit, pausing as the hoppers feed and bask in the sun, and merges with other bands. Bands have been known to travel for 24 km before they fledge into adults. The mutual attraction between the individual hoppers continues into adulthood and the insects continue to act as a cohesive group, a swarm.|$|E
50|$|Swarms of the <b>African</b> <b>migratory</b> <b>locust</b> fly by day {{and settle}} {{on the ground at}} night where they roost and feed on vegetation. After sunrise they warm {{themselves}} in the sun before taking to the air again. They often settle for a while {{in the middle of the}} day, but do not normally feed much at this time. If the day is cloudy or cold, they may not fly at all. The swarm tends to adopt a stratiform shape with a dense rounded leading edge and more dispersed trailing edge. It can be extremely dense and tends to move downwind. African migratory locusts travel closer to the ground than desert locusts and do not usually cover such large distances.|$|E
50|$|Locusta migratoria manilensis, {{commonly}} known as the Oriental migratory locust, is a subspecies of the migratory locust (L. migratoria) in the family Acrididae. It is sufficiently different in size and structure from the <b>African</b> <b>migratory</b> <b>locust</b> to be considered a distinct subspecies of the migratory locust. It is found in southeastern Asia and is an important agricultural pest in the region. It is normally a solitary insect but when conditions are suitable, it enters into a gregarious phase when the young form into bands which move together and the adults into swarms. Although outbreaks may have recently been fewer in number and size because of changes in agricultural practices and better locust detection, the insects remain active as crop pests and the potential for outbreaks is still present.|$|E

40|$|Biology and Transformation of the <b>Migratory</b> <b>Locust</b> Locusta migratoria manilensis Meyen (Orthoptera: Acrididae) at Several Laboratory Population Density Levels. Â  The <b>migratory</b> <b>locust,</b> Locusta migratoria manilensis Meyen (Orthoptera: Acrididae) is one {{of insect}} pests in Indonesia that {{undergoes}} a unique polymorphic biology. Â  The locust develops a transformation phase which is triggered mainly by high population density. Â  Its recent outbreaks in several regions of Indonesia cause major concern and control strategies must be developed to strengthen control efforts in the future. Its unique polymorphic phenomenon, therefore, must be investigated thoroughly for the basis of management of the outbreak. Â  Due to its agility and its long range flying ability, the most realistic technique to study behavioral and morphological change of the locust is in controlled condition at a laboratory or a green house facility. The experiment was aimed to study effects of colony densities on the biology and transformation process of the <b>migratory</b> <b>locust.</b> Â  More specifically, the experiment was to study effects of population density on the feeding activity, mortality rate, and the ratio of F/C and E/F of the <b>migratory</b> <b>locust</b> L. migratoria manilensis. Â  The population densities were simulated in colonies at 2, 5, 10, 20, dan 30 couples per cage (cage size: 45 x 45 x 90 cm) reared in a green house. Results of the experiment show that, in general, higher densities of the <b>migratory</b> <b>locust</b> colonies tended to feed more rigorously {{than those of the}} less dense colonies. Â  The locust remained in solitary phase at the density of 2 - 5 couples per cage whereas the transient phase occured at the density of 10 - 20 couples per cage. Â  The colonies transformed to gregarious stage when their densities were 30 couples per cage or higher.
