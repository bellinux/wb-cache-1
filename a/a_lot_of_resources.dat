He was not sure if he wanted to be {{identified}} with a cartoon show or not at the time, like many of the other early guest stars on The Simpsons, and was therefore credited as A.

This episode was a satire of the Bigfoot specials that had aired on the Fox network at the time when this episode was written. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> were spent on the backgrounds in the episode, trying to make them look realistic with many observational details such as trees, rocks, fences and the way the cars were positioned.

500|$|On September 23, 2014 in an {{interview}} with Polygon about the cancellation of Blizzard's next generation MMO Titan, Mike Morhaime confirmed that StarCraft: Ghost was also cancelled. Morhaime said, [...] "It was hard when we canceled Warcraft Adventures. It was hard when we canceled StarCraft: Ghost, but it has always resulted in better-quality work." [...] In a July 2016 Polygon article, it was suggested that when the game's production halted the main reasons it was shelved were because the game worked on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, but it was scheduled to be released in 2005 when the Xbox 360 was about to be released, and it would take <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> to move from the previous console generation to the current generation as well as Blizzard having a lot of success with its then recently released PC-only game World of Warcraft.|$|E
500|$|The team spent <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> in {{carrying}} out detailed motion capture, to enhance players' engagement with the story and {{make it easier for}} them to form emotional attachments to characters, and to keep the game and the TV show consistent with each other. They also hoped that use of this technology would add realism to the game and prevent players from getting distracted by the characters' unrealistic behaviors and appearances. Lake added that one of the challenges when recording motion capture is to convince the inexperienced actors, who thought that the system lacked complexity, not to overact. According to Lake, the game features a technology that creates realistic digital counterparts of the characters and records every little detail of their faces. The team initially did the recording at Los Angeles, where actors need to wear spandex suits with tracking marks and head cameras. Remedy invited the actors to Remedy's office in Helsinki, where they used their own technology to carry out extremely detailed motion capturing of facial expressions and movements in dialogue. Ashmore described the chamber for motion capturing as a [...] "Sweat Box", as actors must remain steady, moving only their faces, in order to prevent the motion capture data from getting ruined.|$|E
2500|$|During the 16th and 17th centuries, the Council of Zürich {{adopted an}} isolationist attitude, {{resulting}} in a second ring of imposing fortifications built in 1624.

2500|$|The avenues {{from which}} teams {{acquired}} marquée talent started to close and DeWitt, recognizing {{that he needed}} to change his club's approach to stay competitive, went about [...] "abandoning a philosophy of chasing big names" [...] that had netted such stars as McGwire, Edmonds, Kile, Édgar Rentería and Rolen. [...] Said DeWitt, [...] "We had great teams in that era, but I knew that that wasn’t sustainable because as that group aged, we would need younger players. [...] With the new labor agreement that was coming in, teams were holding on to their players." [...] He added, [...] "we were opportunistic prior to that by getting players from other clubs, but we made a conscious decision back in the ’03 and ’04 time frame {{that we were going to}} throw <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> and make every effort to build from within ... Rather than giving up draft choices, we tried to accumulate draft choices." [...] To avert continual reliance on signing free agents and trading for stars already in their prime, DeWitt sought to place the expertise of people like Jeff Luhnow to create an efficient player development system utilizing the entire organization. [...] DeWitt hired him in 2003 to become the vice president of baseball development. [...] As Luhnow lacked a baseball background, his hire was seen as unconventional, but DeWitt saw potential in the Northwestern graduate with an MBA because of his business background and analytical ability.|$|E
2500|$|Diet was {{an issue}} that is often {{discussed}} through this time, as an aspect of medical care. [...] Since our idea of modern technology did not exist, diet was a simple way for Romans to attain a healthy life. [...] This remains true in the Roman Military as the soldiers required appropriate nutrition in order to function at high activity levels. Because of the number of the people requiring food, there were unique circumstances in the acquisition of food. [...] During a campaign the soldiers would often forage food from their enemies land. [...] In fact as part of the standard kit, Roman soldiers would carry a sickle, which would be used to forage food. [...] They would carry a three-day ration of food in case they were in a situation where foraging was not available. [...] This would largely consist of items such as wheat and barley. [...] During a time of peace, the Roman Army would have had a typical diet consisting of bacon, cheese, vegetables, and beer to drink. Corn is mentioned in their works as well, however; this was a [...] common term that was applied to their use of grain. [...] The Roman use of the term corn is {{not to be confused with}} maize, which did not come to Europe until the discovery of the New World. [...] Items such as poultry and fish were also likely part of the standard diet. [...] The soldier was given a ration, which was taken from his pay. [...] This shows that the soldiers were well fed in times of peace. [...] If the soldiers were well fed, they were healthier and able to maintain a high level of physical activity, as well as stave off disease. [...] Disease is something that is easier to prevent rather than treat. [...] This idea holds true in the event a fort was under siege; certain food items were rationed such as poultry. [...] The reasoning behind this was that poultry was very inexpensive to maintain and in the event of a siege it did not require <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> to maintain. [...] It was also noted that poultry had benefits for those who were sick. [...] This demonstrates the idea was present that the army needed to maintain the health of its members regardless of circumstances. [...] These discoveries were made while looking at the remains of Roman military sites. [...] By excavating these sites and looking at fecal matter found, scientists were able to determine what was eaten. [...] It is a simple fact that poor diet negatively affects a military's combat readiness. [...] The variety of food found shows the Romans were not focused on just caloric intake, as they knew a variety of food was important to health.|$|E
