40|$|The {{potential}} of energy-conscious traditional design of dwellings has been recognised with its direct and sometimes sophisticated response to local climatic conditions in recent years. Courtyard forms, which provide heat, light, ventilation and other functions for buildings surrounding it, {{are found in}} many high density urban environments around the world. This current study focuses {{on one of the}} solutions which can contribute to embodying the energy-conscious tradition. As an issue of how buildings respond to the different climate arises on a global scale, emphasis is placed on regional urban courtyard housing, for which design proposals are made, with special reference to Seoul, Korea (latitude 37. 34 ° N). Apart from acting as climatic modifiers through solar <b>access,</b> <b>courtyard</b> housing forms can offer spatial and visual amenities to otherwise monotonous urban plan buildings. The aim {{of this study is to}} gain an understanding of the relationship between courtyard design and solar radiation in a densely built housing development. The parametric study examines the possibilities of varying housing layout factors in courtyard design, such as housing density, plot dimension, housing development scale and housing orientation, thereby suggesting guidelines for suitable ranges of the design parameters of courtyard housing. By these means, a density objective in urban area can be achieved with certain parameters with a potential to form energy-conscious courtyard design. Solutions for optimising the use of solar energy in courtyard housing layout in future housing development are categorised into (1) efficient layout planning, which include the range of optimum use of the housing layout factors and storey height under land use policy, and (2) passive courtyard housing form, which respond to urban housing layouts. Implications of the design strategies for planners, designers and local authorities are then outlined, including design guidelines...|$|E

5000|$|Venn Lansdown's {{drawing is}} {{inaccurate}} {{in that he}} exaggerates {{the space between the}} house in North Parade Passage and the [...] "Town House". It is about half that shown by him. It is possible to <b>access</b> the <b>courtyard</b> and view this in person. The key to the gate beside the friends meeting house is held by Crisp Cowley Estate agents.|$|R
50|$|St Augustine's Abbey {{was founded}} in 1140. The {{earliest}} parts of the gatehouse were built by around 1170, as the main entrance of the monastic precinct, giving <b>access</b> to its <b>courtyard.</b>|$|R

50|$|The narrow high {{triangular}} parapeted rear {{entrance is}} <b>accessed</b> from the <b>courtyard</b> from a door sheltered by a moulded concrete awning supported by consoles which sits beneath the large semi-circular window which lights the main stairwell.|$|R
5000|$|The Hackesche Höfe is {{a notable}} {{courtyard}} complex situated {{adjacent to the}} Hackescher Markt in the centre of Berlin. The complex consists of eight interconnected <b>courtyards,</b> <b>accessed</b> through a main arched entrance at number 40 Rosenthaler Straße.|$|R
50|$|This pazo is {{the most}} {{characteristic}} and important in the area. A gate gives <b>access</b> to a <b>courtyard</b> through which {{you come to a}} stone staircase leading to the upper units. The estate, of good dimensions, includes a chapel, exclusive for the family.|$|R
50|$|No {{gateways}} {{connect the}} inner ward {{to the outer}} <b>courtyard.</b> <b>Access</b> into Ewloe Castle was entirely via wooden ramps. The outer ward had several wooden buildings. An external defensive rampart occupies the higher ground {{to the south of}} the castle above the neck ditch.|$|R
50|$|The courtyards {{within the}} Acropolis each had four sides, {{although}} they were not square. Although the courtyards were all on different vertical levels, this {{appears to have been}} a deliberate decision by planners, and the multi-level nature of the complex was intentionally maintained throughout its period of use, even though the architectural layout, floor levels, and <b>access</b> between <b>courtyards</b> changed over time. The courtyards were enclosed by a labyrinthine mass of multi-level architecture decorated with complex sculpture representing mythic and historical subjects, combined with hieroglyphic texts.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} centuries saw {{the further}} {{transformation of the}} building that was gradually losing {{the character of the}} manor to configure itself as an elegant mansion, suitable to the prestige of the powerful feudal lords. The current entrance is opening along the wall on Piazza Conciliazione, built in 1710 {{at the behest of the}} Countess Dorotea Acquaviva. Is possible to <b>access</b> a <b>courtyard</b> which in turn provides access to the late Renaissance porch. Further work on building complex have followed one another until the late 19th century.|$|R
50|$|The inner {{courtyard}} of the castle is a simple square area from which two large halls, positioned on {{the east and west}} sides of the manor, can be <b>accessed.</b> The <b>courtyard</b> is open to the sky, allowing greater illumination of the rooms and the collection of rainwater in the grand cistern located below it. The pavement of the courtyard is sloped so that all the water converges at the centre, where there is an opening into the cistern. This reserve supply of water would be precious {{in the event of a}} siege.|$|R
50|$|Public {{functions}} include lecture hall, café, boutique {{and school}} service. They are all placed on ground level with direct <b>access</b> to both <b>courtyards.</b> Special exhibition spaces and administration are {{found on the}} second floor. The underground level contains the modern exhibition space {{as well as a}} workshop, wardrobe and storage.|$|R
50|$|During the 19th century, {{the palace}} {{ownership}} changed hands {{a number of}} times. Since 1853, it has been attached to Roman Catholic colleges in the city, since 1930 {{it has been the}} site of the Jesuit postgraduate institution for Jesuits, the Collegio Bellarmino.

25|$|The columbarium in the {{north-east}} {{corner of}} the site, separated from the church by a narrow walkway, is a small, open-walled <b>courtyard,</b> <b>accessed</b> through an arched opening with a metal gate. The tall, orange brick walls, capped by concrete, contain small niches, with those containing ashes enclosed by brass name plaques. Rectangular garden beds are set into the concrete floor.|$|R
50|$|The civil {{administration}} and government archives were {{housed in the}} Rez-de-Chaussee of the right wing; the left wing housed {{the administration of the}} regiment William Henry maintained on behalf of the King of France. The storage rooms were in the basement and could be <b>accessed</b> from the <b>courtyard</b> via a door in front of the stables and a side staircase.|$|R

The courtyard entrances are on the east and the west and the mosque and mausoleum are <b>accessed</b> through the <b>courtyard.</b> A wooden arcade with pointed arches wraps around the courtyard and rises to form portals with tall domes at bays leading into the buildings.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} doors within the {{structure}} (south, north, northeast and west), with {{the likelihood that}} six doors or passageways provided <b>access</b> to the <b>courtyard</b> between the fortifications inner and outer walls. These passages were short and narrow and permitted only {{one person at a}} time from accessing the spaces, likely on all-fours. One of the spaces connects the battlement's gallery and these passages.|$|R
5000|$|The prayer hall is {{preceded by}} a <b>{{courtyard}},</b> <b>accessed</b> through a tall muqarnas portal on the western wall, once flanked by a bathhouse, a bakery and shops. The courtyard is also entered from Suq al-Sakkaniyya Street to the north. The courtyard is roughly rectangular and has an octagonal ablution basin at its center. Its floor is paved with colored stones arranged in a geometric layout.|$|R
50|$|Its {{configuration}} is classical {{compared to}} others constructions in Rennes: two buildings {{separated by a}} courtyard, one of them overlooking the street. They still exist today. A passage under the house give <b>access</b> to the <b>courtyard,</b> both for cars and pedestrians, passing houses the staircase to the floor. One common gallery and service quarters link the two buildings {{on the east side}} of the court. Stables, east of service quarters complement the set.|$|R
50|$|The {{courtyard}} {{is a vast}} trapezoidal area whose interior {{dimensions are}} approximately 67 by 52 meters. It is surrounded on all its four sides by a portico with double rows of arches, opened by slightly horseshoe arches supported by columns in various marbles, in granite or in porphyry, reused from Roman, Early Christian or Byzantine monuments particularly from Carthage. <b>Access</b> to the <b>courtyard</b> by six side entrances dating from the ninth and thirteenth centuries.|$|R
5|$|Each block had <b>access</b> to <b>courtyards,</b> {{known as}} airing courts, and the asylum was {{surrounded}} by extensive grounds. At {{the end of each}} courtyard were stone rooms used to house incontinent patients, who slept on straw beds. All buildings were made from stone and iron, avoiding the use of wood because of the potential fire hazard. Hot and cold plunge baths were also included, as Fox saw their use as an important part of treatment, which may have been related to his Quaker beliefs and John Wesley's advocacy of the practice. The total construction cost around £35,000. In addition to the wealthy private patients, paupers funded by parish funds were also admitted and kept in accommodation furthest from the central block, which was for the highest in society.|$|R
50|$|The central {{courtyard}} still retains some of {{the original}} features of the building, with minimal modifications. In the courtyard there are some plantations such as Cestrum nocturnum and Star Jasmine giving the palace a romantic appearance day and night. At the courtyard a small but decorative fountain features at a wall. Most rooms on the groundfloor touching the courtyard have direct portal <b>access</b> to the <b>courtyard.</b> From the large backgardens {{there is now a}} side backyard.|$|R
2500|$|The large cobblestoned palace {{courtyard}} measuring 1300 {{square metres}} (4265 square feet) is enclosed by the Hofburg building and represents [...] "the most beautiful inner courtyard in Innsbruck". Since the Baroque reconstruction, the courtyard has been decorated with sculptural {{elements such as}} pilaster, frames, cornices and the cartouches with the Austrian striped shield in the gables of the facades. The variations ensue from the varying old structures in the east, south, north and west. Four portals allow <b>access</b> into the <b>courtyard.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the 18th century, this {{classical}} gateway {{formed the}} focal point of place Louis le Grand (now place Vendôme), opposite the gateway of the new couvent des Capucines on the opposite side. It gave <b>access</b> to a <b>courtyard</b> in front of the church and to a passage linking the convent to the stables of the Tuileries and the 'terrasse des Feuillants'. This passage was later enlarged to form rue de Castiglione, whose construction led to the destruction of the gateway.|$|R
50|$|The {{entry to}} the double enceinte is defended by two {{cylindrical}} towers and a flying bridge, flanked to the north by a bastion. A drawbridge and a posternflanked by a cylindrical tower to the north provide <b>access</b> to the <b>courtyard.</b> The residence is to the south, {{the ruins of the}} chapel to the north. To the east, the towers give access to a covered chemin de ronde and to the south the bastion connected to the fortress and a further building.|$|R

5000|$|The Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad ibn Qala'un Mosque is {{an early}} 14th-century mosque at the Citadel in Cairo, Egypt. It was built by the Mamluk sultan Al-Nasr Muhammad in 1318 as the royal mosque of the Citadel, where the sultans of Cairo {{performed}} their Friday prayers. The mosque is located {{across the street from}} the <b>courtyard</b> <b>access</b> to the Mosque of Muhammad Ali. The Sultan also built a religious complex in the center of the city, next to the one by his father Qalawun.|$|R
50|$|Built out of cut-stone, {{the roughly}} {{rectangular}} complex was centered {{on an open}} courtyard fortified with ramparts, similar to a ribat. The crenellated rampart walls were buttressed with round bastions at the corners and semi-circular bastions at {{the middle of the}} south, east and west walls. A monumental gate centered on the eastern wall gave <b>access</b> to the <b>courtyard,</b> which was surrounded with halls of different sizes to its north and west, including a mosque on the western wing and a single minaret near the northeastern corner.|$|R
