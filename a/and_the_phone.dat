5|$|The {{idea for}} Whitepages was {{conceived}} by Alex Algard, while studying at Stanford in 1996. Algard {{was searching for}} a friend's contact information <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> company gave him the wrong number. He thought of an online email directory as an easier to way to find people. Algard bought the Whitepages.com domain for $900, which he says was all of his savings at the time. He continued operating the website as a hobby while working as an investment banker for Goldman Sachs. He expanded the database of contact information using data licensed from American Business Information (now a part of Infogroup). Eventually WhitePages was producing more ad-revenue than Algard was earning at Goldman Sachs. In 1998, Algard left his job {{to focus on the}} website; he incorporated Whitepages in 2000.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Barkan et al. {{published}} several {{attacks on}} GSM encryption. The first {{is an active}} attack. GSM phones can be convinced to use the much weaker A5/2 cipher briefly. A5/2 can be broken easily, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> uses the same key as for the stronger A5/1 algorithm. A second attack on A5/1 is outlined, a ciphertext-only time-memory tradeoff attack which requires {{a large amount of}} precomputation.|$|E
25|$|Prestel was a British information-retrieval {{system based}} on {{teletext}} protocols. However, it was essentially a different system, using a modem <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> system to transmit and receive the data, comparable to systems such as France's Minitel. The modem was asymmetric, with data sent at 75-bit/s, and received at 1200-bit/s. This two-way nature allowed pages to be served on request, {{in contrast to the}} TV-based systems' sequential rolling method. It also meant that a limited number of extra services were available such as booking event or train tickets and a limited amount of online banking.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the ransoming process, the Cázares {{were allowed}} to talk with their {{remaining}} relatives in three occasions. In their first phone conversation, the victims talked about their concern for their wives and children. Their second conversation was a lot shorter and emotive for the Cázares, however. By July 27, the kidnappers said they needed a final cash deliver in order to release them. The Cázares sent the money to Matamoros from Texas and eagerly awaited at a disclosed location for a white van {{that was supposed to}} deliver their relatives. The van never came <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> line that the family used to contact the kidnappers was out of service. Weeks after that, the family decided to contact law enforcement.|$|E
25|$|On July 9, 2011, alleged gunmen of the Gulf Cartel kidnapped 18 {{members of}} the Cázares family from three {{different}} households in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico. The children and women were eventually released three days later, but the abductors kept five men. Forty-eight hours later, the Gulf Cartel contacted the members who had been released to start negotiating ransom. After several days of negotiation and several ransom payments totaling US$100,000, the Cázares were called to deliver their final payment on July 27. They sent {{the money to the}} kidnappers and waited in a disclosed location for a white van the kidnappers had pledged to deliver their remaining family members. However, the van never arrived <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> the kidnappers used to contact the Cázares went out of service. The family then decided to contact authorities and open the case. The Cázares men have been missing ever since.|$|E
25|$|Under Bradlee's leadership, The Washington Post took {{on major}} {{challenges}} during the Nixon administration. In 1971 The New York Times and the Post successfully challenged the government {{over the right}} to publish the Pentagon Papers. One year later, Bradlee backed reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein as they probed the break-in at the Democratic National Committee Headquarters in the Watergate Hotel. According to Bradlee: You {{had a lot of}} Cuban or Spanish-speaking guys in masks and rubber gloves, with walkie-talkies, arrested in the Democratic National Committee Headquarters at 2 in the morning. What the hell were they in there for? What were they doing? The follow-up story was based primarily on their arraignment in court, and it was based on information given our police reporter, Al Lewis, by the cops, showing them an address book that one of the burglars had in his pocket, and in the address book was the name 'Hunt,' H-u-n-t, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> number was the White House phone number, which Al Lewis and every reporter worth his salt knew. And when, the next day, Woodward—this is probably Sunday or maybe Monday, because the burglary was Saturday morning early—called the number and asked to speak to Mr. Hunt, and the operator said, 'Well, he's not here now; he's over at' such-and-such a place, gave him another number, and Woodward called him up, and Hunt answered the phone, and Woodward said, 'We want to know why your name was in the address book of the Watergate burglars.' And there is this long, deathly hush, and Hunt said, 'Oh my God!' and hung up. So you had the White House. You have Hunt saying 'Oh my God!' At a later arraignment, one of the guys whispered to a judge. The judge said, 'What do you do?' and Woodward overheard the words 'CIA.' So if your interest isn't whetted by this time, you're not a journalist.Ensuing investigations of suspected cover-ups led inexorably to congressional committees, conflicting testimonies, and ultimately to the resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974. For decades, Bradlee was one of only four publicly known people who knew the true identity of press informant Deep Throat, the other three being Woodward, Bernstein, and Deep Throat himself, who later revealed himself to be Nixon's FBI associate director Mark Felt.|$|E

500|$|The first Beach Boy to hear [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] in a semi-completed {{form was}} Carl Wilson, who had {{previously}} participated in rough guide vocals with Brian for the initial February mix. Following a performance with the touring group in North Dakota, he remembered: [...] "I came back up into my hotel room one night <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> rang. It was Brian on the other end. He called me from the recording studio and played this really bizarre sounding music over the phone. There were drums smashing, that kind of stuff, and then it refined itself {{and got into the}} cello. It was a real funky track." [...] In 1976, Brian revealed that before the final mixdown, he had been confronted with resistance by members of the group, whom Brian declined to name. The subject of their worries and complaints was the song's length and [...] "modern" [...] sound: [...] "I said no, it's not going to be too long a record, it's going to be just right. ... They didn't quite understand what this jumping from studio to studio was all about. And they couldn't conceive of the record as I did. I saw the record as a totality piece." ...|$|E
500|$|Sally visits Larry at a DVD {{shop and}} is {{told that he}} has been documenting an [...] "Easter egg" [...] in {{seventeen}} apparently unrelated DVDs. The egg contains video clips of a man calling himself The Doctor, having half of a conversation with the viewer. Larry gives Sally a list of the DVDs and she leaves for the police station. There she meets DI Billy Shipton, who explains that there have been several disappearances at Wester Drumlins and shows her an impound lot containing a locked fake police box. Sally leaves but remembers the Yale key and returns to find that Billy <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> box have disappeared. She immediately receives a call from a much older Billy, who is on his death bed at the hospital. She visits him and he explains that after she left the lot, he discovered the Angels trying to retrieve the police box. He then suddenly found himself in 1969, where he met the Doctor and was asked to relay a message to Sally decades later. Billy subsequently married and started a video production house that was responsible for putting the Easter egg on the DVDs. Before Billy dies he tells Sally the Doctor's message, which instructs her to look at the list. Sally realises that the list is her own DVD collection and that the Easter egg is meant for her.|$|E
