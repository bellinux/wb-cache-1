Institutions must provide a computer network infrastructure, including servers, audio/visual equipment, software, and the technical support {{needed to develop}} and maintain <b>asynchronous</b> <b>learning</b> environments. Technical support includes initial training and setup, user management, data storage and recovery, as well as hardware repairs and updates. [...] Research indicates faculty members who are hesitant to teach in <b>asynchronous</b> <b>learning</b> environments are so {{because of a lack}} of technical support provided by their institutions. However, for faculty to teach successfully in an <b>asynchronous</b> <b>learning</b> environment, they must be technically adept and comfortable enough with the technological tools to optimize their use.|$|E
50|$|<b>Asynchronous</b> <b>learning</b> is a student-centered {{teaching}} method that uses online learning resources to facilitate information sharing outside {{the constraints of}} time and place among a network of people. <b>Asynchronous</b> <b>learning</b> is based on constructivist theory, a student-centered approach that emphasizes the importance of peer-to-peer interactions. This approach combines self-study with asynchronous interactions to promote learning, and {{it can be used to}} facilitate learning in traditional on-campus education, distance education, and continuing education. This combined network of learners and the electronic network in which they communicate are referred to as an <b>asynchronous</b> <b>learning</b> network.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} that <b>asynchronous</b> online <b>learning</b> can create a rich cognitive presence capable of supporting effective, higher-order learning. It begins by exploring the properties of <b>asynchronous</b> online <b>learning</b> and their link with the dimensions of higher-order learning. The dimensions of higher-order learning emerge from the concepts of reflective inquiry, self-direction and metacognition. Moreover, it is argued that the dimensions of higher-order learning, reflection and collaboration, are, in fact, congruent with the asynchronous and connectivity properties of online learning. Finally, the issues and principles of effective <b>asynchronous</b> online <b>learning</b> are explored...|$|R
40|$|The {{innovation}} and diversification {{of development in}} multimedia technology and network infrastructures have brought a significant impact to education, especially for distance learning. This paper presents a model-based <b>asynchronous</b> distance <b>learning</b> system development that consists of a presentation semantic model called the multimedia augmented transition network (MATN) model and an <b>asynchronous</b> distance <b>learning</b> system called the Java-based Integrated <b>Asynchronous</b> Distance <b>Learning</b> (JIADL) system. The MATN model is powerful in modeling the synchronization and quality-of-service (QoS) for distance learning multimedia presentations. The JIADL system can support diverse <b>asynchronous</b> distance <b>learning</b> services by integrating RealPlayer and Java technology to augment the superiority of both models. A course sample is used to illustrate and validate {{the effectiveness of the}} system. How to use the MATN model to model the diversity requirements of a distance learning multimedia presentation is also discussed. Furthermore, the initial experimental results show that our system is cost effective and has a wide range of applications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{describes}} an experiment we conducted using both synchronous and asynchronous online tools {{in computer science}} courses at the Open University of Israel. We believe that computer science courses are appropriate for investigating on-line learning because many of them deal with processes (algorithms, queries on databases, etc.) which are much easier to learn through animated presentations than through written explanations. The success of this experiment encourages us to widen the experiment in the coming semesters.

40|$|Abstract: – In higher education, {{the trend}} {{continues}} {{to shift from}} traditional teaching methods to student-centered strategies that are known to promote learning. At the same time, the integration of online education {{into the mainstream of}} higher education is intensifying. This paper addresses the problem of adapting classroom strategies for <b>asynchronous</b> online <b>learning,</b> so as to derive a learning model that combines the flexibility of online education with effective classroom-based strategies. The paper prescribes methods for putting into practice, for online education, active learning strategies that have been proven to be effective in the traditional classroom environment. First, the paper presents an overview of various active learning strategies and common classroom activities. Next, it introduces an array of open technologies and standards relating to learning resources, collaboration and learning experience management, and media markup languages. Then, it describes methods, which are based on the open technologies and standards, for effecting the learning strategies and common classroom activities in <b>asynchronous</b> online <b>learning.</b> This line of research (devising methods to augment the flexibility and other advantages of <b>asynchronous</b> online <b>learning</b> with classroom strategies that are known to enhance learning) has the potential for changing the face of online education...|$|R
40|$|Background: Online {{learning}} is a growing delivery model for education; however, there exists a void in the literature regarding the adoption of online learning models in rural K- 12 school systems. Purpose: To provide pertinent data to the rural school administrator {{so that they may}} make an informed decision in regards to the potential implementation of <b>asynchronous</b> online <b>learning</b> within their school and/or district. Literature Review: Explores the history, impact on student outcomes, graduation rates, cost effectiveness and student engagement factors in regards to online learning. Research Design: A quantitative ex-post facto, causal-comparative design was used while embracing Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovation Theory. Data Collection and Analysis: Student achievement data were collected from a rural high school where some students participated in an <b>asynchronous</b> online <b>learning</b> environment while other students participated in the traditional face-to-face environment. Results: Students participating in <b>asynchronous</b> online <b>learning</b> environments performed below students in traditional learning environments for all four subjects (a) English Language Arts, (b) mathematics, (c) science, and (d) social studies, on both metrics, test score and percentile rank. Conclusion: Although this study would probably not result in the exclusion of online learning in rural settings, it may assist school boards and principals to consider the inclusion of online learning carefully, before extensive financial input occurs. The results also assist with identifying key pitfalls to avoid when establishing online learning environments...|$|R
50|$|<b>Asynchronous</b> <b>learning</b> environments are {{described}} as online spaces where work is supported {{through the use of}} digital platforms {{in such a way that}} participants are not required to be online at the same time. Threaded discussions, e-mail, and telephone calls are options of asynchronous delivery. This gives meaning to the anytime-anywhere appeal of online learning. A benefit of <b>asynchronous</b> <b>learning</b> is the learner having more time to generate content-related responses to the instructor and peer postings; they have time to find facts to back their written statements. The additional time provides an opportunity to increase the learner's ability to process information. The spelling and grammar within postings of an asynchronous environment are like that found in formal academic writing. On the other hand, one of the main limitations of this delivery method is the greater potential for a learner to feel removed from the learning environment. <b>Asynchronous</b> <b>learning</b> is viewed as less social in nature and can cause the learner to feel isolated. Providing the student a feeling of belonging to the university or institution will assist with feelings of isolation; this can be done through ensuring links to university support systems and the library are accessible and operable.|$|E

40|$|Working {{together}} while accomplishing a task is {{a characteristic}} of a powerful learning environment that aims at active knowledge construction. Studies have demonstrated that collaborative <b>learning</b> by using <b>asynchronous</b> communication tools can have advantages over collaboration in a face-to-face setting. However, it is questionable whether students are {{able and willing to}} learn collaboratively through these new kinds of learning environments. The present research investigates whether <b>asynchronous</b> collaborative <b>learning</b> is a feasible learning method for student teachers. In particular, this article explores issues of students’ participation, interaction, and experience while using an <b>asynchronous</b> Computer-Supported Collaborative <b>Learning</b> (CSCL) environment to facilitate collaborative learning. Two studies that apply various instructional settings are presented. Findings show that students did not use CSCL environment effectively to facilitate their collaboration.

50|$|Another {{advantage}} of <b>asynchronous</b> <b>learning</b> (and, as technology develops, many synchronous learning environments) {{is that there}} is a record of nearly everything that occurs in that environment.

They {{have the opportunity to}} complete their work in a low stress environment and within a more flexible time frame. In asynchronous online courses, students proceed at their own pace. If they need to listen to a lecture a second time, or think about a question for a while, they may do so without fearing that they will hold back the rest of the class. Through online courses, students can earn their diplomas more quickly, or repeat failed courses without the embarrassment of being in a class with younger students. Students have access to an incredible variety of enrichment courses in online learning, and can participate in college courses, internships, sports, or work and still graduate with their class.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} different levels of progress in <b>asynchronous</b> collaborative <b>learning</b> activities. The context for this research is organizations of distributed and mobile practitioners. When introducing collaborative learning parallel to daily work tasks we cannot assume that all participants have the same possibility to actively engage. Therefore the learners can be {{at different levels of}} progress in the collaborative learning activity. To facilitate collaborative activity the progress of the participants has to be synchronized in some way. The main problem addressed in this paper is the difficulty for participants to keep a common progress, to enable discussions, in <b>asynchronous</b> collaborative <b>learning.</b> To address this problem three methods for synchronization (synchronization points) are suggested: locked scenes, written instruction and collaborative production. The three methods were implemented and evaluated in an organization using a Net-scenario, the Net-scenario as a system and a methodology based on role-playing to initiate collaborative learning. This system was suitable to use in the evaluation since it can be used asynchronously as well as synchronously, supports distributed participants and is dependent on collaborative discussion concerning the content presented...|$|R
