Better images need a smaller focal point. The focal size required, f, is related to the length of the actual focal size. f = F*sin (angle), where the angle is the <b>anode</b> <b>angle.</b> A larger <b>anode</b> <b>angle</b> means a larger focal point.|$|E

AimIn this study, {{the effect of}} <b>anode</b> <b>angle</b> on photon beam spectra, depth dose and photon fluence per initial electron was studied for a commercial orthovoltage unit of X-RAD 320 biological irradiator. Materials and methodsThe MCNPX MC code was used for modeling in the current study. We used the Monte Carlo method to model the X-RAD 320 X-ray unit based on the manufacturer provided information. The MC model was validated by comparing the MC calculated photon beam spectra {{with the results of}} SpekCalc software. The photon beam spectra were calculated for anode angles from 15 to 35 degrees. We also calculated the percentage depth doses for some angles to verify the impact of <b>anode</b> <b>angle</b> on depth dose. Additionally, the heel effect and its relation with <b>anode</b> <b>angle</b> were studied for X-RAD 320 irradiator. ResultsOur results showed that the photon beam spectra and their mean energy are changed significantly with <b>anode</b> <b>angle</b> and the optimum <b>anode</b> <b>angle</b> of 30 degrees was selected based on less heel effect and appropriate depth dose and photon fluence per initial electron. ConclusionIt can be concluded that the <b>anode</b> <b>angle</b> of 30 degrees for X-RAD 320 unit used by manufacturer has been selected properly considering the heel effect and dosimetric properties...|$|E

40|$|A {{software}} program, SpekCalc, {{is presented}} for {{the calculation of}} x-ray spectra from tungsten anode x-ray tubes. SpekCalc was designed primarily {{for use in a}} medical physics context, for both research and education purposes, but may also be of interest to those working with x-ray tubes in industry. Noteworthy is the particularly wide range of tube potentials (40 - 300 kVp) and <b>anode</b> <b>angles</b> (recommended: 6 - 30 degrees) that can be modelled: the program is therefore potentially of use to those working in superficial/orthovoltage radiotherapy, as well as diagnostic radiology. The utility is free to download and is based on a deterministic model of x-ray spectrum generation (Poludniowski 2007 Med. Phys. 34 2175). Filtration can be applied for seven materials (air, water, Be, Al, Cu, Sn and W). In this note SpekCalc is described and illustrative examples are shown. Predictions are compared to those of a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo code (BEAMnrc) and, where possible, to an alternative, widely-used, spectrum calculation program (IPEM 78) ...|$|R
40|$|Flat-panel cone-beam CT (CBCT) {{has been}} applied {{clinically}} {{in a number of}} high-resolution applications. Increasing geometric magnification can potentially improve resolution, but also increases blur due to an extended x-ray focal-spot. We present a shift-variant focal-spot blur model and incorporate it into a model-based iterative-reconstruction algorithm. We apply this algorithm to simulation and CBCT test-bench data. In a trabecular bone simulation study, we find traditional reconstruction approaches without a blur model exhibit shift-variant resolution properties that depend greatly on the acquisition protocol (e. g. short vs. full scans) and the <b>anode</b> <b>angles</b> of the rays used to reconstruct a particular region. For physical CBCT experiments focal spot blur was characterized and a spatial resolution phantom was scanned and reconstructed. In both experiments image quality using the shift-variant model was significantly improved over approaches that modeled no blur or only a shift-invariant blur, suggesting a potential means to overcome traditional CBCT spatial resolution and system design limitations.

40|$|A novel one-fourth scale low {{temperature}} electrolytic {{model of the}} Hall-Heroult cell was constructed to investigate the electrolytic bubble formation, coalescence, and movement under the horizontal anode surface. The principles of geometric and dynamic similarities were applied in developing this model electrolytic cell for the first time. A 0. 28 M aqueous CuSO 4 + 20 pct H 2 SO 4 solution {{was used as the}} electrolyte. Analogous to the Hall-Heroult cell, copper (Cu) was deposited at the cathode and oxygen (O 2) bubbles were generated underneath the anode. The bubble generation mechanism, development, coalescence, and detachment underneath the anode were observed using a high speed camera. It was found that electrolytic bubbles were generated uniformly under the entire anode surface and grew through gas diffusion and coalescence. With increasing current density (CD) and anode inclination angle to the horizontal, bubble velocity increased underneath the anode surface. Moreover, the bubble layer thickness and bubble sizes decreased with an increase in anode inclination angle. Bubble coverage under the anode also decreased with increasing anode inclination angle, but was found to be insensitive to the change in CD. Finally, the calculated bubble resistance was found to decrease with increasing <b>anode</b> <b>angle...</b>|$|E
40|$|In routine applications, {{information}} about the photon flux of x-ray tubes is obtained from exposure measurements and cataloged spectra. This approach relies mainly {{on the assumption that}} the real spectrum is correctly approximated by the cataloged one, once the main characteristics of the tube such as voltage, target material, <b>anode</b> <b>angle,</b> and filters are taken account of. In practice, all this information is not always available. Moreover, x-ray tubes with the same characteristics may have different spectra. We describe an apparatus that should be useful for quality control in hospitals and for characterizing new radiographic systems. The apparatus analyzes the spectrum generated by an x-ray mammographic unit. It is based on a commercial CZT produced by AMPTEK Inc. and a set of tungsten collimator disks. The electronics of the CZT are modified so as to obtain a faster response. The signal is digitized using an analog to digital converter with a sampling frequency of up to 20 MHz. The whole signal produced by the x-ray tube is acquired and analyzed off-line in order to accurately recognize pile-up events and reconstruct the emitted spectrum. The energy resolution has been determined using a calibrated x-ray source. Spectra were validated by comparison of the HVL measured using an ionization chamber...|$|E
40|$|The {{method of}} CT {{dosimetry}} {{based on the}} CTDI is a common measurement method by using a single, axial rotation about a pencil chamber in a stationary phantom. For some time now {{there has been a}} growing awareness that radiation dose originating from medical diagnostic procedures in radiology, is contributing an increasing proportion to the total population dose, with a large component coming from CT examinations. This is accompanied by rapid developments in CT technology, including the use of increasingly wide X ray scanning beams, which are presenting problems in dosimetry that currently cannot be adequately addressed by existing standards. When preparing any dosimetric assessment of a CT scanner it is essential to have a good knowledge of the production of X rays and the characteristics of the CT scanner. Factors that influence the X ray beam intensity and photon spectrum are the tube voltage, the anode material, and <b>anode</b> <b>angle,</b> the filtration of the X ray tube, and the tube current. The properties of the radiation field for CT dose considerations can be characterized by free in air measurements of air kerma (absorbed dose in air). Measurements in standard cylindrical phantoms yield dosimetric quantities such as CTDI that can be considered as a patient dose index, and are also useful for quality assurance purposes, however they should not be interpreted as patient dose...|$|E
40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} the air kerma {{distribution of the}} radiation output in two and three dimensions of three general radiographic units by physical measurements. Methods: A 6 -cm 3 ionization chamber was placed at 5 -cm intervals of 225 locations in a 70 × 70 cm 2 x-ray beam field. The chamber was placed {{at a level of}} 30 cm above the x-ray table to measure the air kerma intensity of the x-ray output across the whole area. Three different brands of radiographic units with different <b>anode</b> target <b>angles</b> and at different tube aging stages were studied. The same exposure parameters were used for each location, and measurements were made for three different tube potentials at 60, 85, and 110 kilovoltage peaks (kV[p]). Results: At the tube potential of 85 kV(p), the relative maximum percentage differences on the average air kerma measured along the central anode-cathode axis (x-axis) of the x-ray tube were found to be 31. 5 %, 15. 5 %, and 43. 1 % more at the cathode ends than those at the anode ends of the three radiographic units. Results of a paired samples t test (confidence intervals at 95 %, two-tailed) on three of the four fixed pair-wise sampling points along the x-axis were found to be statistically significant in their relative percentage differences in air kerma intensity with respect to the central point (labeled as 35 cm) with a P value ≤. 03. However, those measured at four fixed pair-wise points at 90 ° across the anode-cathode direction were all found to be statistically nonsignificant (P ≥. 29). Similar trends were observed for the other two tube potentials tested. From the three-dimensional displays of radiation output intensity, a similar unique pyramidal shape pattern with a skewed peak toward the cathode end was observed for all three diagnostic x-ray tubes tested. Conclusions: The anode heel effect was found to be enhanced in the x-ray tube with a smaller <b>anode</b> target <b>angle,</b> more aging, and higher tube potentials. Three-dimensional air kerma distribution maps of the three x-ray units tested were found to be similar in pattern, and this was displayed in detail regarding the extent of the anode heel effect.

40|$|The {{gas bubble}} laden layer under the anodes during the {{electrolysis}} of alumina {{plays an important}} role in the hydrodynamics and the voltage balance of reduction cells. The hydrodynamics of bubble-induced flow is significantly enhanced by the detachment of bubbles from the 'formation zone'. In this study, the sliding bubble dynamics and associated flow patterns on a downward facing inclined surface were examined experimentally and numerically. In the experimental part of the investigation, the shape and bubble detachment were analysed in a cold water model with the aid of high speed camera. In the numerical part, a phase-field technique was used to validate and verify the experimental data under various operating conditions. Our observations indicate that the bubble changes its shape from a sphere to an elongated spheroid or ellipsoid (wedge-like structure) during the detachment process. The bubble elongates to form a tail-like shape. The change in shape of the bubble is almost instantaneous and has a significant effect on the localised hydrodynamics around the bubble, which could influence the dynamics of the flow patterns in the Hall-Heroult cell. Moreover, the length of bubble and thickness were found to be a function of <b>anode</b> inclination <b>angle</b> and the rate at which the bubble forms...|$|R
5000|$|What {{is special}} about side-window tubes is an {{electrostatic}} lens {{is used to}} focus the beam onto a very small spot on the anode. The anode is specially designed to dissipate the heat and wear resulting from this intense focused barrage of electrons. Some anodes are mechanically spun to increase the area heated by the beam (e.g. edical [...] "rotating anode") or cooled by circulating coolant (indirectly on most rotating anodes). The <b>anode</b> is precisely <b>angled</b> at 1-20 degrees off perpendicular to the electron current so as to allow the escape {{of some of the}} X-ray photons which are emitted perpendicular to the direction of the electron current. The anode is usually made out of tungsten or molybdenum. The tube has a window designed for escape of the generated X-ray photons.|$|R
50|$|Crookes tubes {{generated}} the electrons {{needed to create}} X-rays by ionization of the residual air in the tube, instead of a heated filament, so they were partially but not completely evacuated. They consisted of a glass bulb with around 10−6 to 5×10−8 atmospheric pressure of air (0.1 to 0.005 Pa). An aluminum cathode plate {{at one end of}} the tube created a beam of electrons, which struck a platinum anode (for economy, made from nickel or copper with a thin platinum face) target at the center generating X-rays. The <b>anode</b> surface was <b>angled</b> so that the X-rays would radiate through the side of the tube. The cathode was concave so that the electrons were focused on a small (~1 mm) spot on the anode, approximating a point source of X-rays, which resulted in sharper images. The tube had a third electrode, an anticathode connected to the anode. It improved the X-ray output, but the method by which it achieved this is not understood. A more common arrangement used a copper plate anticathode (similar in construction to the cathode) in line with the anode such that the anode was between the cathode and the anticathode.|$|R
30|$|The test {{images were}} {{acquired}} {{with a home}} made micro-CT which consists of a CMOS FPD and a micro focus X-ray tube (L 8121 - 01, Hamamatsu, Japan). The micro-focus X-ray source is a sealed tube with a fixed tungsten <b>anode</b> having an <b>angle</b> of 25 ° against the electron beam and with a 200 μ m-thick beryllium exit window. The emitted X-ray beam span angle is about 43 °. The source has a variable focal spot size from 5 μ m to 50 μ m depending on the applied tube power (Watt or kVp mA). The maximum tube voltage and tube current are 150 kVp and 0.5 mA, respectively. The micro-focus X-ray source has been operated in a continuous mode with an Al filter with a thickness of 1 mm. The FPD (C 7943 CA- 02, Hamamatsu, Japan) used in this experiment consists of 1216 × 1220 effective matrix of transistors, photodiodes with a pixel pitch of 100 μ m and a CsI:Tl scintillator. The CsI:Tl has a columnar structure with a typical diameter of about 10 μ m and a thickness of 200 μ m. A computer-controlled rotating system was adopted in the object holder to achieve a cone-beam mode scan in the micro-CT. The precision of the rotational motion is 0.083 ° which allows the number of views larger than 4, 000. The system has the built-in white and dark image correction schemes. Since our micro-CT system does not provide the CT images in Hounsfield unit (HU), we have normalized all the original (uncorrected) reconstructed images so that the maximum pixel intensity is 1.0 with arbitrary unit. The corrected images are scaled using the corresponding normalization factor of the uncorrected images.|$|R
40|$|Summary In this work, {{several aspects}} around {{headspace}} (HS) sampling and detection hyphenated with gas chromatography (GC) were covered. Regarding HS sampling, {{the results of}} three studies were reported around the problems encountered with the analysis of aqueous samples and/or high boiling analytes with a high affinity for the matrix in chapters 2 to 4 in this manuscript, whilst the final chapter covers the development and characterization of a novel GC detector. In chapter 2, {{the use of the}} full evaporation technique (FET) for the analysis of high boiling analytes with a high affinity for apolar matrices was evaluated and compared with the conventional static HS (sHS) sampling approach. A FET method has been developed and validated for the analysis of typical high boiling analytes (bp. > 200 °C) including camphor, menthol, methyl salicylate and ethyl salicylate that are often used in various topical formulations. Data have shown that FET is an excellent approach to circumvent matrix effects that are often encountered with sHS methods. The method showed excellent recovery and repeatability during validation and was finally applied on commercial formulations such as Radosalil , ThermoCream , Vicks Vaporub  and Reflexspray . In chapter 3, acetone acetals were employed as water scavengers for the analysis of aqueous samples using HS-GC. After optimization of the scavenging reaction conditions, the approach was used for FET analysis of various typical high boiling polar residual solvents that are miscible with water. The procedure enabled sample enrichment which provided a significant gain in sensitivity of the FET analysis of these analytes and it was finally applied on a cefotaxime sample for the quantification of residual N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP). During experiments it was revealed that the same procedure can be used for the quantitative derivatization of ethylene glycol (EG) in aqueous samples. The formation of the significantly more volatile 2, 2 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -dioxolane (2, 2 -DD) enabled determining EG using sHS sampling. In chapter 4, a novel HS approach for the analysis of quaternary ammonium salts (QAS) in aqueous samples is presented in which the reported water scavenging method from chapter 3 is used for the removal of water and sample enrichment. Screening experiments revealed that QAS substituted with benzyl and methyl groups degrade to form benzyl chloride and chloromethane under the used experimental conditions. By using chloromethane and benzyl chloride for quantification of such QAS, matching calibration standards are not needed. This means that one kind can be used for the determination of other QAS that also yield chloromethane and benzyl chloride as reaction products. The methodology was used for the analysis of denatonium benzoate (DB) in EG based cooling liquids and the analysis of benzoxonium chloride (BZOCL) or benzethonium chloride (BZTCl) in mouth sprays. Finally in chapter 5, work around the development and characterization of a novel GC detector is presented. The detector used a micro cavity hollow cathode discharge (µCHCD) plasma as ion source combined with an either positively or negatively biased capture electrode. Typical advantages of the used low power µCHCD are the increased ionization efficiency compared to the hydrogen flame used in the flame ionization detector (FID) and operation at atmospheric pressure without the need for additional gasses. During development of the µCHCD ion source {{it was found that the}} detector geometry was of great influence on the obtained signal. By adapting to a geometry with a wide <b>anode</b> clearance <b>angle,</b> a sensitive response in the pg range was obtained for various analytes including carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) which is poorly detected with the FID. It was noticed that halogenated analytes were possibly subjected to a different ionization mechanism than the non-halogenated species. Halogenated ones most likely form negative ions in the electron rich plasma as these were most efficiently detected by a positively biased capture electrode. status: publishe...|$|R
