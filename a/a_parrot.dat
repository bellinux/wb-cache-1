5|$|Trained {{cockatoos}} {{are sometimes}} seen in bird shows in zoos. They are generally less motivated by food than other birds; some may more respond to petting or praise than food. Cockatoos {{can often be}} taught to wear <b>a</b> <b>parrot</b> harness, enabling their owners to take them outdoors.

5|$|Malick's {{unconventional}} filming techniques included shooting {{part of a}} scene {{during a}} bright, sunny morning only to finish it weeks later at sunset. He {{made a habit of}} pointing the camera away during an action sequence and focus on <b>a</b> <b>parrot,</b> a tree branch or other fauna. Malick's reputation and working methods commanded great respect among the actors, with both Woody Harrelson and John Savage staying on for an extra month after they finished all of their scenes just to watch him at work.|$|E
5|$|The Australian ringneck (Barnardius zonarius) is <b>a</b> <b>parrot</b> {{native to}} Australia. Except for extreme {{tropical}} and highland areas, the species has adapted to all conditions. Traditionally, two species were {{recognised in the}} genus Barnardius, the Port Lincoln parrot (Barnardius zonarius) and the mallee ringneck (Barnardius barnardi), but the two species readily interbred at the contact zone and are now considered one species. Currently, four subspecies are recognised, each with a distinct range.|$|E
5|$|The Child has curly {{blond hair}} and sits on a white cloth, {{animated}} and upright, {{at the side of}} the Virgin's lap.

At some point the Child's nudity was covered up; this overpaint was removed during a late 20th-century restoration.

5|$|Hergé {{returned}} to creating fictional nations as allusions to real countries in subsequent Adventures, such as Syldavia and Borduria (based largely on Yugoslavia and Nazi Germany) in King Ottokar's Sceptre and Sondonesia (based on Indonesia) in Flight 714 to Sydney. He also re-used other elements pioneered in The Broken Ear {{in his later}} Adventures: <b>a</b> <b>parrot</b> in The Castafiore Emerald, a ravine crash in The Calculus Affair, a fireball and vivid dream in The Seven Crystal Balls, and a firing squad in Tintin and the Picaros. Tintin {{returned to}} San Theodores in Tintin and the Picaros, in which the characters Pablo and Ridgewell also made a reappearance.|$|E
5|$|The {{children}} liked animals, {{and their}} menagerie included dogs, cats, birds, raccoons, opossums, rabbits, a Shetland pony and <b>a</b> <b>parrot.</b> The children once used their animals {{to conduct a}} circus {{on the grounds of}} the Governor's Mansion. Hogg charged each visitor five cents, but was forced to return the money when her father discovered the scheme. In later years, the family added a bear, a horse, a fawn, cockatoos, and two ostriches named Jack and Jill to their collection of animals. In response to a challenge from her brothers, Hogg once mounted one of the ostriches, but was thrown from its back after one of the boys hit it with a slingshot. Ima and her ostriches later became the protagonists of a picture book, Ima & the Great Texas Ostrich Race, by Margaret Olivia McManis and Bruce Dupree.|$|E
5|$|The Hero is then {{reunited with}} Amanda, an escapee from his prison, who steals the pendant {{in order to}} win her brother Lester's freedom. The mayor of Jadd, Davias, takes the pendant but {{transforms}} Lester into <b>a</b> <b>parrot.</b> The Hero and Amanda confront a Medusa for its tear which will break the spell. They kill it but Amanda is infected by the Medusa's attack causing her to transform into one. The Hero reluctantly kills her and uses her tears to break Lester's spell. Lester avenges Amanda's death by killing Davias who reveals he gave the pendant to the Dark Lord. The Hero confronts and defeats the Dark Lord; however, Hero discovers that the Heroine is under Julius' mind control and has opened the entrance to the Mana Tree. Julius reveals he is the last survivor of the Vandole empire, the empire who attempted to control the Mana Tree years ago, and handily defeats the Hero.|$|E

25|$|In some manifestations, {{particularly}} as angry, ferocious aspects of Shakti such as Durga or Kali, she has {{eight or ten}} arms, and is astride on a tiger or lion. In benevolent manifestation such as Kamakshi or Meenakshi, <b>a</b> <b>parrot</b> sits near her right shoulder symbolizing cheerful love talk, seeds and fertility. <b>A</b> <b>parrot</b> is found with Parvati's form as Kamakshi - the goddess of love, as well as Kama - the cupid god of desire who shoots arrows to trigger infatuation. A crescent moon is sometimes included near the head of Parvati particularly the Kamakshi icons, for her being half of Shiva. In South Indian legends, her association with the parrot began when she won a bet {{with her husband and}} asked for his loin cloth as victory payment; Shiva keeps his word but first transforms her into <b>a</b> <b>parrot.</b> She flies off and takes refuge in the mountain ranges of south India, appearing as Meenakshi (also spelled Minakshi).|$|E
