5|$|Initially the old {{tower was}} {{converted}} into a stronger keep which was able to support artillery guns on its roof, a gatehouse was built alongside it, four stirrup towers – so-called because of their shape – a curtain wall was constructed <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> of the castle, and bastions erected around the wall. Towards {{the end of this}} phase of work the castle was altered in a frantic burst of work, possibly driven on by pressure from the King himself. The height of the curtain wall was increased, the gatehouse extended into an entrance bastion, a new network of underground passages installed, and foreworks added <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> of the bastions. By the end of 1540 the castle was garrisoned with 17 men and equipped with artillery, with Chute appointed as its captain.|$|E

Fans inside and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>outsides</b> of <b>the</b> crater are closely similar to Earth's alluvial fans. As on Earth, the largest rocks are near the mouths of the fans. Because the channels start at ridge tops, it is believed they were formed by heavy downpours. Researchers {{have suggested that the}} rain may have been initiated by impacts.|$|R
5|$|During the night, another storm broke (this time {{probably}} a thunder-storm, possibly with a south easterly wind), preventing the Allies from setting off southwards {{to counter the}} Persian detachment sent <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> of Euboea. However, the storm also hit the Persian detachment of ships, driving them off course and onto the rocky coast of 'the Hollows' of Euboea. This part of the Persian fleet was thus also shipwrecked, losing most of the ships.|$|E
5|$|Magnussen made {{a second}} pit {{stop at the}} end of lap 16 for a {{steering-wheel}} change. On lap 17 Ricciardo went to the outside of Massa on the S-curves and moved inside, passing Massa to move into sixth. Rosberg was informed by team radio that more rain was expected within eight minutes. Vettel overtook Bottas <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> for fourth place on the next lap. Bottas fell to fifth on the 19th lap, when Ricciardo passed him <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> on the S-curves. Vettel began to reduce the time deficit to third-place Button, and Ricciardo was driving at a speed similar to his teammate. Bottas was caught by his Williams teammate Massa, who pulled away from Hülkenberg (who went off the track at the second turn). Both Red Bull drivers were the fastest by lap 21, but were 13 seconds behind Button and a further five seconds behind Rosberg (who, despite running off the track at 130R corner, had a shrinking one-second advantage over Hamilton). A dry line began to emerge by this time as some drivers drove through standing water to keep their tyre temperatures down.|$|E
5|$|On {{his way to}} the {{starting}} grid, Carlos Sainz Jr. stopped on track and had to be pushed back to pit lane, where he eventually started, only to retire after just a few hundred metres. At the start, both Mercedes drivers got away well and Hamilton tried to overtake Rosberg for the lead <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> of the first corner, but were unable to do so. Jenson Button made a good start, moving from 16th to 13th, while Marcus Ericsson fell from 13th to 18th. Behind the leaders, the Ferrari drivers retained third and fourth place respectively. Bottas moved into fifth after moving <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside.</b> Hamilton was able to follow Rosberg closely in the opening laps, while Daniel Ricciardo was the first driver to pit for new tyres on lap four. One lap later, Grosjean was able to use drag reduction system (DRS) to overtake Felipe Nasr for eleventh. With his back row start and an early pit stop, Ricciardo overtook the two Manor Marussia cars around lap nine.|$|E

5|$|On the 39th lap, Castroneves overtook Bräck <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> at turn {{three and}} moved into third place, and Fernández got ahead of Bräck <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> at the same corner two laps later. Takagi drove {{to the inside of}} the third turn {{underneath}} Servià, and both drivers made contact with the side of their cars; Servià became briefly airborne and heavily damaged the left side of his car when he hit the outside wall which caused the fifth caution. Servià was unhurt but Takagi managed to continue without any apparent damage. The race resumed on lap 45 with de Ferran leading Tagliani. Castroneves hit the rear-end of Tagliani's car on the following lap but both drivers continued without damage. The sixth caution was shown on the 49th lap when Takagi hit the right-rear wheel of Moreno's car in the turn three right-hand corner. Moreno was sent into a spin while Takagi's suspension had broke and retired from the event. de Ferran and Tagliani made pit stops for fuel and tires during the caution and could reach the end of the race without a second pit stop. De Ferran and Tagliani rejoined in 14th and 15th places.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} moat {{around the}} tower {{would have been}} a simple design, but it was redesigned in the 1460s to provide a walkway <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> of the Great Tower. The niches in the walls of the walkway are of 17th-century origin, and would originally have held classical statues - the walkway would have provided a dignified way of admiring the Great Tower. It is likely that fish would have been bred in the moat.|$|E
5|$|De Ferran {{gained the}} lead and {{maintained}} it at the lap-104 restart. Bräck attempted to pass de Ferran <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> of the first turn for first place {{but was unable to}} get ahead. De Ferran pulled away {{from the rest of the}} field. Dixon drove into the pit lane and became the race's fifth (and final) retirement on the 106th lap. His pit crew claimed his car was damaged following contact with Servià during the caution period. Kanaan was closely following Andretti but was held up by the driver which allowed Paul Tracy to pass him. The move caused Kannan's car to develop understeer and Vasser got ahead of him. Carpentier set the race's fastest lap during the 134th lap, completing a circuit in 25.521 seconds. On lap 138, Bräck drafted off slower cars while de Ferran was slowed by Papis in turn four. Bräck got ahead of de Ferran <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> driving into the first turn to take over the lead on the same lap. On the final lap, Bräck led de Ferran by two-tenths of a second. As the two drivers went onto the backstraight, De Ferran drafted up to the outside of Bräck and closed up to him in the second and third corners. De Ferran steered right and overtook Bräck for the lead in the fourth turn's entrance. Both drivers avoided making contact at the corner's edge and de Ferran drove defensively causing Bräck to reduce his speed to avoid colliding with him.|$|E

5|$|Dunstanburgh Castle's {{buildings}} are located <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> of the fortification's outer bailey, enclosed by a stone curtain wall, which enclose , {{making it the}} largest castle in Northumberland. Possibly {{from the very start}} of the castle, and certainly by the 1380s, the castle buildings formed three distinct complexes supporting the Earl's household, the castle's constable and the administration of the Embleton barony respectively. The inside of the bailey still shows the marks of former strip farming, which can be seen in winter.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Artillery Memorial is a stone {{memorial}} at Hyde Park Corner in London, {{dedicated to}} the First World War casualties of the Royal Regiment of Artillery. The memorial was designed by Charles Jagger and Lionel Pearson, and features a giant sculpture of a BL 9.2-inch Mk I howitzer upon a large plinth of Portland stone, with stone reliefs depicting scenes from the conflict. Four bronze figures of artillerymen are positioned <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> of the memorial.

5|$|The castle was {{constructed}} on a limestone spur, overlooking {{the mouth of}} the Pennard Pill stream and Three Cliffs Bay, and was protected to the north and west by surrounding cliffs. The fortification initially took the form of an oval-shaped ringwork, , with a defensive ditch and ramparts <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside,</b> and a timber hall in the centre. A local church, St Mary's, was built just to the east and a settlement grew up around the site; a rabbit warren was established in the nearby sand dunes. In the early 13th century, a simple stone hall, approximately , was built {{on the site of the}} older timber building, using red-purple sandstone with white limestone detailing.|$|E

5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc {{of the plain}} maskray is thin and diamond-shaped with narrowly rounded outer corners, measuring 1.1–1.3 times longer than wide. The leading margins of the disc are gently concave and converge at a broad angle to the pointed tip of the snout. The small eyes are placed close together, and behind them are the spiracles. The nostrils are elongated and have a skirt-shaped flap of skin between them. The small mouth bears prominent furrows at the corners and contains two slender papillae on the floor. Small papillae are also found <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> of the mouth. There are five pairs of gill slits. The pelvic fins are fairly large and pointed.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} castle was huge, protected on {{one side}} by the sea cliffs, with a stone curtain wall, a massive gatehouse and six towers <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside.</b> A harbour {{was built on the}} south side of the fortress, enabling access from the sea. Northumbria was a lawless region in this period, suffering from the activities of thieves and schavaldours, a type of border brigand, many of whom were members of Edward II's household, and the harbour may have represented a safer way to reach the castle than land routes.|$|E
