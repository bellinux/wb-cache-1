5000|$|Relatively {{little is}} known about Suchten's life. His parents were Georg von Suchten and Euphemia Schultz. The Suchten family (in Polish [...] "Suchta") came {{originally}} from the Lower Rhine region. In 1400 the family moved to Danzig, where they became quite influential; some members of the family became city councilors and mayors. Christoph Suchten, a paternal uncle, was secretary to the Polish king Sigismund I the Old; a maternal uncle, Alexander Schultze (Scultetus) was a canon in Frombork {{and one of the few}} friends of Nicolaus Copernicus. From 1535 Suchten attended the Gymnasium in Elbląg. In December 1538 he received a position as a canon in Frombork, through his uncle Alexander Schultze. Not long after, this position was barred to uneducated men, so Suchten matriculated in the University of Leuven on 19 January 1541, where he studied philosophy and medicine. Around 1545 he spent a lot of time at the court of Albert of Prussia in Königsberg, where he published his poem Vandalus (based on a Polish legend about Princess Wanda). Between 1549 and 1552 Suchten was employed as an alchemist by Otto Henry, Elector Palatine. From about 1554 to 1557 he was at the Polish royal court in Kraków. Some time after, he is supposed to have earned a medical doctorate <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>Italian</b> <b>university</b> (perhaps the University of Ferrara). In 1563 he attempted unsuccessfully to gain a position as the personal physician in Königsberg. From 1567 he worked with the Strasbourg doctor Michael Toxites in Alsace and in the Upper Rhine. In the fall of 1574 Suchten began to practise as a country doctor in Linz in Upper Austria. He died there on 7 November 1575.|$|E

We describe the educational environment, goals, design of CSCL activities, and impact of the new course design on teachers, students, and administrators. We confirm that CSCL can be used to enhance on-campus learning, but that many adjustments need to be made. Students appreciate a shared electronic repository for project materials, and a space where they can record reflections when they cannot meet face-to-face. Substantive tasks should not be very complex while students are learning to work in a CSCL environment. The initial impact on teaching staff is substantial, but some practical techniques can reduce post- implementation impact by managing communication among students and between students and teachers. Other success factors include strong co-operation among all those involved and flexibility in many aspects of course operation. Plans for wider implementation should recognise differences in the potential contribution of computer-supported teaching and learning across disciplines, and differences in teachers' needs for computer-support and for training. These differences may result in different times for diffusion of computer-supported initiatives throughout a course, unit, or university...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the opinions of university students on transplantation and organ donation, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> single <b>Italian</b> <b>university.</b> Methods: University undergraduates attending the first year on five different courses in 2001 were surveyed at Padua University by using an anonymous 13 -item questionnaire.

Our results suggest that teacher quality has statistically significant effects on students’ grades on subsequent courses. These effects are also robust after controlling for unobserved individual characteristics. On the other hand, we find less clear evidence when relating teacher quality to student involvement with a subject.

40|$|Does {{the choice}} of the field of study depend on {{individual}} risk aversion? The direction of the relationship between individual risk attitudes and type of college major chosen is potentially ambiguous. On the one hand, risk adverse individuals may prefer majors allowing high returns on the labour market; on the other hand, if these majors expose students to a higher probability of dropping out, those who are more risk adverse may be induced to choose less challenging fields. Using data from a sample of students enrolled in 2009 <b>at</b> <b>a</b> middle-sized <b>Italian</b> public <b>University,</b> we find that, controlling for a large number of individual characteristics, including cognitive abilities, personality traits and family background, more risk adverse {{students are more likely to}} choose any other field (Humanities, Engineering and Sciences) compared to Social Sciences. We interpret this result considering that some of these fields, such as Humanities, allow to reduce the risk of dropping out, while others (such as Engineering and Sciences) involve a lower risk on the labour market. It also emerges that the effect of risk aversion on major choice is related to student ability. Risk adverse students characterized by high abilities tend to prefer Engineering, while the propensity of risk adverse students to enrol in Humanities decreases when ability increases, suggesting that the attention paid to labour market risks and drop out risks varies according to student skills.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} whether grades {{are used by}} educational institutions as a competition variable {{to attract and retain}} students. Using a sample of almost 26, 000 students enrolled <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>Italian</b> <b>University,</b> we document that grades vary significantly across degrees. After controlling for students ’ characteristics, class-size, classmates ’ quality and degree fixed effects, it emerges that students obtain better grades and are less likely to drop-out when their degree course experiences an excess of supply. We adopt an instrumental variable strategy to account for endogeneity problems and instrument the excess of supply by using the total number of universities offering each degree course. Our IV estimates confirm that the teaching staff on degree course facing low demand tend to set lower academic standards with the result that their students obtain better grades and have a lower probability of dropping out than they might otherwise...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} how the direct access to additive manufacturing (AM) systems impacts on education of future mechanical engineers, within <b>a</b> Master's program <b>at</b> <b>a</b> top <b>Italian</b> <b>University.</b> Design/methodology/approach - <b>A</b> survey is specifically designed to assess the relevance of entry-level AM within the learning environment, as a tool for project development. The survey is distributed anonymously to three consecutive cohorts of students who attended the course of "computer-aided production (CAP) ", within the Master of Science Degree in Mechanical Engineering at Politecnico di Torino. The course includes a practical project, consisting in the design of a polymeric product with multiple components and ending with the production of an assembled prototype. The working assembly is fabricated by the students themselves, who operate a fused deposition modelling (FDM) machine, finish the parts and evaluate assemblability and functionality. The post-course survey covers diverse aspects of the learning process, such as: motivation, knowledge acquisition, new abilities and team-working skills. Responses are analyzed to evaluate students' perception of the usefulness of additive technologies in learning product design and development. Among the projects, one representative case study is selected and discussed. Findings - Results of the research affirm a positive relationship of access to AM devices to perceived interest, motivation and ease of learning of mechanical engineering. Entry-level additive technologies offer a hands-on experience within academia, fostering the acquisition of technical knowledge. Research limitations/implications - The survey is distributed to more than 200 students to cover the full population of the CAP course over three academic years. The year the students participated in the CAP course is not tracked because the instructor was the same and there were no administrative differences. For this reason, the survey administration might be a limitation of the current study. In addition to this, no gender distinction is made because historically, the percentage of female students in Mechanical Engineering courses is about 10 per cent or lower. Although the answers to the survey are anonymous, only 37 per cent of the students gave a feedback. Thus, on the one hand, impact assessment is limited to a sample of about one-third of the complete population, but, on the other hand, the anonymity ensures randomization in the sample selection. Practical implications - Early exposure of forthcoming designers to AM tools can turn into a "think-additive" approach to product design, that is a groundbreaking conception of geometries and product functionalities, leading to the full exploitation of the possibilities offered by additive technologies. Social implications - Shared knowledge can act as a springboard for mass adoption of AM processes. Originality/value - The advantages of adopting AM technologies at different levels of education, for diverse educational purposes and disciplines, are well assessed in the literature. The innovative aspect of this paper is that the impact of AM is evaluated through a feedback coming directly from mechanical engineering student...|$|R

The findings suggest that the NMP fosters narrative innovations, mainly of a reflexive nature (reflection and reconceptualization). Moreover, during counseling and the follow-up session, the pattern of change is primarily characterized by reconceptualization IMs, the most complex form of narrative innovation...|$|E

High ability students appear to benefit more from the treatment. The experiment design allows us to disentangle “workload division or commitment” effects from “feedback provision” effects. We find that the estimated treatment impact is due exclusively to the first effect, while the feedback provision has no positive effect on performance.
