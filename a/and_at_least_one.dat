5|$|By late on July3, Ana {{weakened}} to {{a tropical}} depression. The storm also lost tropical characteristics and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone early on July4, over the western Atlantic Ocean. The extratropical remnants persisted until dissipating about twenty-four hours later. Minimal impact was reported {{as a result}} of Ana, other than rip currents in coastal North Carolina. Due to the rough seas, 14rescues and one serious injury occurred at Carolina Beach. In addition, five rescues were made at Kure Beach <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> person was hospitalized. However, there were no fatalities at either location.|$|E
5|$|Damage totals in the United States are {{not fully}} known, {{although}} media summaries of Nora included a loss to agriculture preliminarily estimated at several hundred million dollars, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> study places the figure at $150–200 million (1997 USD). It is estimated that $30–40 million (1997 USD) in damage to lemon trees occurred. Although Nora was significantly weakened, near hurricane-force winds were observed at the Dixie National Forest in southwestern Utah, where strong gusts sheared off the tops of large trees.|$|E

5|$|Likely of Balkan origin, Basiliscus was {{the brother}} of Aelia Verina, wife of Leo I. It {{has been argued that}} Basiliscus was uncle to the {{chieftain}} of the Heruli, Odoacer. This link is based on the interpretation of a fragment by John of Antioch (209.1), which states that Odoacer and Armatus, Basiliscus' nephew, were brothers. However, not all scholars accept this interpretation, since sources do not say anything about the foreign origin of Basiliscus. It is known that Basiliscus had a wife, Zenonis, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> son, Marcus.|$|E
5|$|Mecopterans mostly inhabit moist environments {{although}} a few species are found in semi-desert habitats. Scorpionflies, family Panorpidae, generally live in broad-leaf woodlands with plentiful damp leaf litter. Snow scorpionflies, family Boreidae, appear in winter and are to be seen on snowfields and on moss; the larvae being able to jump like fleas. Hangingflies, family Bittacidae, occur in forests, grassland and caves with high moisture levels. They mostly breed among mosses, in leaf litter and other moist places, but their reproductive habits have been little studied, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> species, Nannochorista philpotti, has aquatic larvae.|$|E
