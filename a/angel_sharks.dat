5|$|Some seabed–dwelling {{species are}} highly {{effective}} ambush predators. <b>Angel</b> <b>sharks</b> and wobbegongs use camouflage {{to lie in}} wait and suck prey into their mouths. Many benthic sharks feed solely on crustaceans which they crush with their flat molariform teeth.|$|E
5|$|The Chilean {{angelshark}} (Squatina armata) of {{the southeastern}} Pacific was synonymized with this species by Kato, Springer and Wagner in 1967, but was later tentatively recognized as a separate species again by Leonard Compagno. The taxonomic status of <b>angel</b> <b>sharks</b> in the southeastern Pacific – whether they are S. californica, S. armata, or if {{there is more than}} one Squatina species in the region – remains unresolved. The <b>angel</b> <b>sharks</b> inhabiting the Gulf of California may also represent a different species, as they mature at a much smaller size than those from the rest of their range.|$|E
50|$|The angular <b>angel</b> <b>shark</b> or spiny <b>angel</b> <b>shark</b> (Squatina guggenheim) is an <b>angel</b> <b>shark</b> of {{the family}} Squatinidae found off {{southern}} Brazil, Uruguay, and northern Argentina at depths of between 4 and 265 m. Its length is up to 1.3 m.|$|R

5000|$|In April 2008, the UK {{government}} {{afforded the}} <b>angel</b> <b>shark</b> full {{protection under the}} Wildlife and Countryside Act. Once considered abundant in the Atlantic Ocean, the <b>angel</b> <b>shark</b> (Squatina squatina) was classified as [...] "critically endangered" [...] in 2010.|$|R
5|$|In {{ovoviviparous}} {{fish the}} eggs develop inside the mother's body after internal fertilization but receive {{little or no}} nourishment directly from the mother, depending instead on the yolk. Each embryo develops in its own egg. Familiar examples of ovoviviparous fish include guppies, <b>angel</b> <b>sharks,</b> and coelacanths.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic analysis, {{based on}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA, {{has concluded that}} the sand devil and the Pacific angel shark (S. californica) are sister species. The {{two of them in}} turn form a clade with other <b>angel</b> <b>sharks</b> found in the Americas. Molecular clock estimation has timed the divergence of S. dumeril and S. californica at c. 6.1 Ma, around the time that the Isthmus of Panama formed. The rise of the Isthmus likely split the ancestral angel shark population, leading to their becoming separate species.|$|E
5|$|The known diet of the {{dusky shark}} {{encompasses}} pelagic fishes, including herring and anchovies, tuna and mackerel, billfish, jacks, needlefish and flyingfish, threadfins, hairtails, lancetfish, and lanternfish; demersal fishes, including mullets, porgies, grunts, and flatheads, eels, lizardfish, cusk eels, gurnards, and flatfish; reef fishes, including barracudas, goatfish, spadefish, groupers, scorpionfish, and porcupinefish; cartilaginous fishes, including dogfish, sawsharks, <b>angel</b> <b>sharks,</b> catsharks, thresher sharks, smoothhounds, smaller requiem sharks, sawfish, guitarfish, skates, stingrays, and butterfly rays; and invertebrates, including cephalopods, decapod crustaceans, barnacles, and sea stars. Very rarely, the largest dusky sharks may also consume sea turtles, marine mammals (mainly as carrion), and human refuse.|$|E
5000|$|The Taiwan <b>angel</b> <b>shark</b> (Squatina formosa) is a shark in {{the family}} Squatinidae. The Taiwan <b>angel</b> <b>shark</b> {{is one of four}} species of Squatina in the waters around Taiwan and Japan. It is a demersal, ray-like shark that grows to 1-2 meters in length.|$|R
5|$|The Pacific {{angelshark}} {{was first}} scientifically described in 1859 by William Orville Ayres, the first Curator of Ichthyology at the California Academy of Sciences.

5|$|Though the pigeye shark {{will take}} prey from {{anywhere}} in the water column, it tends to hunt close to the sea floor. An apex predator, it feeds mainly on teleost fishes such as croakers, flatfishes, and cutlassfishes, {{and to a lesser extent}} on cartilaginous fishes, cephalopods, and decapod crustaceans. It has also been recorded eating gastropods, sea snakes, dolphins, and whale carrion. Other sharks and rays figure much more prominently in the diets of South African pigeye sharks than those from other regions; the types consumed include requiem sharks, catsharks, <b>angel</b> <b>sharks,</b> guitarfishes, stingrays, and eagle rays.|$|E
5|$|<b>Angel</b> <b>sharks</b> {{in general}} are highly {{threatened}} by commercial trawl fisheries due to their susceptibility to capture and low rate of reproduction, and angel shark species elsewhere {{are known to have}} declined markedly under fishing pressure. Trawling activity in the Yellow Sea {{and other parts of the}} northwestern Pacific is intense and, coupled with pollution, has had a serious impact on the local ecosystem. The Japanese angelshark population is suspected to have declined by up to 50% or more under these conditions, leading the species to be assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It may benefit from a ban on trawling imposed in some areas by the Chinese government, though enforcement is inconsistent.|$|E
5|$|Feeding on fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans, the Japanese {{angelshark}} is a nocturnal ambush predator that {{spends most}} of the day lying still on the sea floor. This species gives birth to live young, which are sustained during gestation by yolk. The litter size varies from two to 10. The Japanese angelshark is not dangerous to humans unless provoked. It is fished in large numbers and used for meat and shagreen, a type of leather. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed it under Vulnerable, citing the intense bottom trawling activity within its range and the low resilience of <b>angel</b> <b>sharks</b> to fishing pressure.|$|E

50|$|The sand {{devil is}} found in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean from Massachusetts to the Florida Keys, where it is fairly common. It also occurs in the {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico, and there are additional unconfirmed records from Cuba, Jamaica, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. The southern extent of its range is uncertain due to confusion with the Gulf <b>angel</b> <b>shark</b> (S. heteroptera) and Mexican <b>angel</b> <b>shark</b> (S. mexicana). This bottom-dwelling shark is found over sandy or muddy bottoms on the continental shelf and slope.|$|R
50|$|The smoothback {{angelshark}} (Squatina oculata) is an <b>angel</b> <b>shark</b> of {{the family}} Squatinidae found in the eastern Atlantic between latitudes 47°N and 28°S. Its length is up to 1.6 metre.|$|R
25|$|Like other <b>angel</b> <b>sharks,</b> S. caillieti has a flattened, ray-like {{form with}} greatly {{enlarged}} pectoral and pelvic fins. The horizontal {{edges of the}} broad, rounded head bear enlarged folds of skin. The large nostrils are teardrop-shaped and preceded by flaps of skin enlarged into two cylindrical barbels that overhang the mouth. The eyes are horizontally oval and placed relatively close together. Behind the eyes are crescent-shaped spiracles, which are spaced further apart than the eyes and bear prominent papillae (nipple-shaped structures) along their posterior inner rims. The mouth is wide and terminally placed on the snout, with furrows at the corners {{and the center of}} the upper lip forming a rounded arch. The upper and lower jaws contain 10 and 9 tooth rows respectively on either side; the teeth are small, conical, and sharp. The five pairs of gill slits are laterally situated on the head.|$|E
25|$|A common predatory {{technique}} {{that has been}} observed among benthic elasmobranchs is ambushing behavior. As it pertains to rays, skates, carpet sharks, and <b>angel</b> <b>sharks,</b> the predator searches for suitable hiding environments such as sand, pebbles, coral, or algae that match its coloration or patterning, which {{is also known as}} aggressive mimicry. Ambushing is a behavior in which a predator relies on its coloring, body structure, or the environment as an advantage in concealing itself while waiting on unsuspecting prey to enter its striking range. There have been recorded occasions where this form of ambushing behavior of stingrays and related benthic sharks has been directed towards a common prey type. One example of this occasion involves the chokka squid, (Loligo vulgaris reynaudii), which spawns in the inshore coastal habitats around South Africa. The diamond ray (Gymnura natalensis) frequently relies on aggressive mimicry as it blends into sandy habitats waiting for preoccupied female chokka squids who are busy spawning. Diamond rays then shoot off from the bottom substrates and use suction feeding to ingest the spawning squids and their eggs. Suction feeding works in conjunction and is aided by ram filter feeding, which is demonstrated by pelagic rays including the manta ray (Manta birostris) and the closely related devil rays (Mobula sp.). Many of the pelagic rays have external mouth structures called cephalic lobes that assist in siphoning in water and planktonic organisms as the rays swim in acrobatic patterns in these patches of food. A stingray's diet includes small fish, snails, clams, and shrimp, and some other small sea creatures.|$|E
500|$|Squatina squatina, the {{angelshark}} or monkfish, is {{a species}} of shark in the family Squatinidae (known generally also as <b>angel</b> <b>sharks),</b> that were once widespread in the coastal waters of the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. Well-adapted for camouflaging itself on the sea floor, the angelshark has a flattened form with enlarged pectoral and pelvic fins, giving it a superficial resemblance to a ray. This species can be identified by its broad and stout body, conical barbels, thornless back (in larger individuals), and grayish or brownish dorsal coloration with a pattern of numerous small light and dark markings (that is more vivid in juveniles). It measures up to [...] long.|$|E
5000|$|The genus Squatina is {{the only}} genus in the monogeneric family Squatinidae. The Taiwan <b>angel</b> <b>shark</b> was {{described}} in 1972 and named after the historic name for Taiwan, [...] "Formosa".|$|R

50|$|The Chilean {{angelshark}} (Squatina armata) is an <b>angel</b> <b>shark</b> of {{the family}} Squatinidae found in the subtropical waters of Chile, that grows up to 1.03 m in length. The holotype is lost. Reproduction is ovoviviparous.|$|R
500|$|The Pacific {{angelshark}} (Squatina californica) is {{a species}} of angelshark, family Squatinidae, found in the eastern Pacific Ocean from Alaska to the Gulf of California, and from Ecuador to Chile, although those in the Gulf of California and southeastern Pacific {{may in fact be}} separate species. The Pacific angelshark inhabits shallow, coastal waters on sandy flats, usually near rocky reefs, kelp forests, or other underwater features. This species resembles other <b>angel</b> <b>sharks</b> in appearance, with a flattened body and greatly enlarged pectoral and pelvic fins. Characteristic features of this shark include a pair of cone-shaped barbels on its snout, angular pectoral fins, and a brown or gray dorsal coloration with many small dark markings.

500|$|Like other <b>angel</b> <b>sharks,</b> {{the sand}} devil is {{viviparous}} with the developing embryos sustained by yolk. Mature females have one functional ovary, on the left, and two functional uteruses. Mating {{occurs in the}} spring; adult males have spines on the outer margins of their pectoral fins, which may help in gripping the female during copulation. Females reproduce no more than once every two years, perhaps longer. Litter size varies from four to 25 pups, and does not appear related {{to the size of}} the female. The gestation period lasts roughly 12 months, and birthing occurs between February and June at depths of [...] The newborns measure [...] in length.

500|$|The {{angelshark}} {{was originally}} {{described by the}} Swedish natural historian Carl Linnaeus, known as the [...] "father of taxonomy", in the 1758 tenth edition of Systema Naturae as Squalus squatina. He did not designate a type specimen. The word squatina is the angelshark's name in Latin, derived from the word for skate; it was made the genus name for all <b>angel</b> <b>sharks</b> by the French zoologist André Duméril in 1806. Other common names used for this species include angel, angel fiddle fish, angel puffy fish, angel ray, angelfish, escat jueu, fiddle fish, monk, and monkfish. Stelbrink and colleagues (2010) conducted a phylogenetic study based on mitochondrial DNA, {{and found that the}} sister species of the angelshark is the sawback angelshark (S. aculeata).
