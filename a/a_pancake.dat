5|$|Various {{types of}} pancake {{machines}} exist, {{such as those}} that run pancake batter through a heated conveyor inside of a box unit, and those that automatically drop pancake batter onto a flattop grill. Some pancake machines, such as one developed by Crepe-Coer, cook both sides of <b>a</b> <b>pancake</b> simultaneously. Semi-automatic pancake machines also exist, which require some human interaction to function, such as the pouring of batter. Commercial pancake machines may be used in the foodservice industry, in cafeterias and by restaurants, and can serve to reduce the waste of stale pancake batter. Some hotels have pancake machines that guests are allowed to operate. They are also used in other environments in a self-service manner, such as in upscale airport lounges and hotels.|$|E
5|$|King Leopold, {{on holiday}} in Paris, wants to visit Monte Carlo, {{but does not}} have time for the seventeen-hour express train ride between the two cities.

A large crowd sees them off from outside the Paris Opera House, including many celebrities from the Paris theatre world. After stopping to fill the car with gas, the King starts it and, from inexperience, accidentally runs it backward over a policeman, who is squashed flat as <b>a</b> <b>pancake.</b> The King starts inflating him with a pump, and then, to save time, lets other onlookers finish the job while he drives off. The onlookers set to the work with gusto, {{so much so that}} the overinflated policeman ends up exploding.|$|E
5|$|Testaroli {{is a type}} of pancake-like pasta {{prepared}} using water, {{wheat flour}} and salt that is sliced into triangular shapes. Chestnut flour is sometimes used in its preparation. The ingredients are mixed together and prepared as a batter, after which it is cooked, sometimes using a two-stage cooking process. In the typical first stage, and sometimes only stage of cooking, the batter is poured and cooked on a hot, flat surface in the style of <b>a</b> <b>pancake</b> or crêpe. In this process, testaroli is traditionally cooked on a testo, which may be prepared for use by being heated over hot coals. A skillet is another cooking device {{that can be used to}} cook the batter. The pasta is then sliced into triangles, and is sometimes directly served after this cooking process. In the second cooking stage that is sometimes performed, the pasta may be set aside to cool, and then cooked further in boiling water.|$|E

500|$|Nicknamed Canada's [...] "Grand National Drunk", the Grey Cup party {{originated}} in the 1948 championship when hundreds of Calgary Stampeders fans descended on Toronto for their team's first appearance in the game. Bringing chuckwagons and horses, the fans organized <b>a</b> <b>pancake</b> breakfast – {{a staple of the}} Calgary Stampede – for bewildered Torontonians. According to historian Hugh Dempsey, [...] "The Grey Cup was just another game until Calgary went down to Toronto with chuckwagons and everything and turned it into an event." [...] The Stampeders won the game on the strength of the [...] "sleeper play", a touchdown scored by Norm Hill after he hid himself from the Ottawa defence by lying down on the sidelines, as if asleep. [...] He received the pass from quarterback Keith Spaith while still on his back. The victory completed the only undefeated season in the history of Canadian professional football. The boisterous celebrations that followed the win gave rise to the legend of Calgary alderman and future mayor Don Mackay riding his horse into the lobby of the Royal York Hotel. [...] This event was repeated in the 2012 Grey Cup game in Toronto to much of the delight of the fans of both teams. The Calgary Grey Cup Committee maintains the tradition of organizing <b>a</b> <b>pancake</b> breakfast at each year's championship.|$|E

500|$|In 1803 Sir John Sinclair, {{president}} of the Board of Agriculture, spoke {{of the need to}} cultivate the substantial Finchley Common and Hounslow Heath (perhaps prophetic of the Dig for Victory campaign of World War II) and fellow Board member Middleton estimated that one tenth of the county, , was uncultivated common, capable of improvement. However William Cobbett, in casual travel writing in 1822, said that [...] "A more ugly country between Egham (Surrey) and Kensington would with great difficulty be found in England. Flat as <b>a</b> <b>pancake,</b> and until you come to Hammersmith, the soil is a nasty, stony dirt upon a bed of gravel. Hounslow Heath which is only a little worse than the general run, is a sample of all that is bad in soil and villainous in look. Yet this is now enclosed, and what they call 'cultivated'. Here is a fresh robbery of villages, hamlets, and farm and labourers' buildings and abodes." [...] Thomas Babington wrote in 1843, [...] "An acre in Middlesex is worth a principality in Utopia" [...] which contrasts neatly with its agricultural description.|$|E
