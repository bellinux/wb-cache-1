5|$|After {{producing}} several interactive games aimed <b>at</b> <b>children,</b> the Miller brothers {{decided to}} create an adult-targeted game with a non-linear story, believable characters, and an ethical dilemma. Initially turned down by Activision, Cyan was later approached by Sunsoft, who helped fund Myst. The game took two years to develop and was Cyan's largest project.|$|E
5|$|A comic book, Lagaan: The Story, {{along with}} two {{colouring}} books, a mask book and a cricket board game were subsequently released to the commercial market. The comic book, available in English and Hindi, was targeted <b>at</b> <b>children</b> {{between the ages of}} six and 14. At the book's launch, Aamir Khan said that they were keen to turn the film into a comic strip during the pre-production phase itself.|$|E

5|$|Atchison {{remarked that}} his {{theme for the}} film, deemed an {{inspirational}} film, was about overcoming obstacles despite difficult challenges along the way. He {{also said that he}} wanted to portray African Americans in a manner that was not stereotypical and tried to show how African American children incorporate some stereotypes. The film alludes to the importance of community as well as to problems black communities face. It also deals with esteem and stigma in school while criticizes the public school system. Cast members said that although the film was aimed <b>at</b> <b>children,</b> they considered it had important lessons for the parents as well.|$|E
5|$|Fourth through {{sixth grade}} {{elementary}} school children are educated {{on the effects of}} food additives, eating healthful foods, reading food labels, and about marketing of food aimed <b>at</b> <b>children.</b> According to Chip Wood, co-founder of the Northeast Foundation for Children, fourth through sixth grade children will typically be between the ages of 9 and 12 years old. The program is provided at no cost to the children and their families. To date, over 15,000 children have participated in the educational program. Pure Food Kids is taught in classrooms, after-school events, and at Parent-Teacher Association events, with all supplies and materials provided by Beecher's, although there is explicitly no promotion or use of any products from any of Dammeier's businesses.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{comprising}} six half-hour episodes, it was {{the first}} science-fiction production to be written especially for an adult television audience in Britain. Previous written-for-television efforts such as Stranger from Space (1951–52) were aimed <b>at</b> <b>children,</b> whereas adult entries into the genre were adapted from literary sources, such as R.U.R. (1938 and again in 1948) and The Time Machine (1949). The serial was the first of four Quatermass productions to be screened on British television between 1953 and 1979, and was transmitted live from the BBC's original television studios at Alexandra Palace in London, one of the final productions before BBC television drama moved to west London.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify facts in the {{relationship}} between students who want to be childcare workers, and positive consciousness and experiences of users because of training <b>at</b> <b>child</b> welfare facilities. These facts were collected by questionnaire survey. The survey was structured with modified questions for the students who want to be childcare workers <b>at</b> <b>child</b> welfare facilities to ask about their experiences in childcare and care for disabled children. This survey was administered to 65 university students (valid response rate: 93. 8 %). The results showed that they would like to become childcare workers through training <b>at</b> <b>child</b> welfare facilities, and they need to get some more successful experiences involving users. Also, many students were exposed for the first time to adults who also use the facilities <b>at</b> <b>child</b> welfare center. This was another positive chance for the students to learn more about their field of study. d...|$|R

5|$|The final {{book in the}} series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows {{became the}} fastest selling book in history, moving 11 million units in the first twenty-four hours of release. The series has also {{gathered}} adult fans, leading {{to the release of}} two editions of each Harry Potter book, identical in text but with one edition's cover artwork aimed <b>at</b> <b>children</b> and the other aimed at adults. Besides meeting online through blogs, podcasts, and fansites, Harry Potter super-fans can also meet at Harry Potter symposia.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the middle}} of the 1970s, comics aimed <b>at</b> <b>children</b> {{gradually}} disappeared. The new breed of underground, alternative and independent comics was aimed at a more mature audience, which ran counter to the public's perception, as well as to legal restrictions. The first wave of alternative comics in the seventies was largely made up of science fiction and fantasy comics, made by budding cartoonists like Gene Day, Dave Sim, Augustine Funnell, Jim Craig, Ken Steacy, Dean Motter, and Vincent Marchesano.|$|E

5|$|Twenty-six Naruto light novels, {{the first}} nine written by Masatoshi Kusakabe, have been {{published}} in Japan. Of these, the first two have been released in English in North America. The first adapted novel, Naruto: Innocent Heart, Demonic Blood (2002), retells a Team 7 mission in which they encounter the assassins Zabuza and Haku; the second, Naruto: Mission: Protect the Waterfall Village! (2003) was based on the second OVA of the anime. Viz has also published 16 chapter books written by Tracey West with illustrations from the manga.

5|$|During the mid-1990s, {{television}} critics praised Jennings for {{his insistence}} on not letting the O.J. Simpson murder case swamp the newscast. Instead, Jennings devoted his energies to covering the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina, anchoring three hour-long prime time specials {{on the subject}} and one Saturday-morning special aimed <b>at</b> <b>children.</b> ABC dedicated more time to covering the conflict than any other network from 1992 to 1996. Jennings received the Goldsmith Career Award for Excellence in Journalism from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, in large part for his passion for the story. Jennings was also credited for raising the profile in the U.S. of another international story, the 1995 Quebec referendum. The Canadian press in particular raved about his in-depth coverage of the issue, {{and he was the}} only anchor to broadcast from Canada {{on the eve of the}} referendum.|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} about child-based effects on parents’ anxiety {{symptoms}} early in life despite the possibility that child characteristics {{may contribute to the}} quality of the early environment and children’s own long-term risk for psychological disorder. We examined bidirectional effects between parent anxiety symptoms and infant fear-based negative affect using a prospective adoption design. Infant fear-based negative affect and adoptive parent anxiety symptoms were assessed <b>at</b> <b>child</b> ages 9, 18, and 27 months. Birth parent negative affect was assessed <b>at</b> <b>child</b> age 18 months. More anxiety symptoms in adoptive parents <b>at</b> <b>child</b> age 9 months predicted more negative affect in infants 9 months later. More infant negative affect <b>at</b> <b>child</b> age 9 months predicted more anxiety symptoms in adoptive parents 18 months later. Patterns of results did not differ for adoptive mothers and adoptive fathers. Birth parent negative affect was unrelated to infant or adoptive parent measures. Consistent with expectations, associations between infant negative affect and rearing parents’ anxiety symptoms appear to be bidirectional. In addition to traditional parent-to-child effects, our results suggest that infants’ characteristics may contribute to parent qualities that are known to impact childhood outcomes...|$|R

5|$|Much of the {{material}} written about her was aimed <b>at</b> <b>children,</b> and {{tended to focus on}} her childhood and early career. Much of it was also highly romanticised and not always historically accurate. She has been referenced in several historical novels, most notably in The French Lieutenant's Woman (1969) by John Fowles, who was critical of the fact that no British scientist had named a species after her in her lifetime. As her biographer, Shelley Emling, noted, this contrasted with some of the prominent geologists who had used her finds, such as William Buckland and Roderick Murchison, who ended up with multiple fossil species named after them. The only person who did name a species after her during her lifetime was the Swiss-American naturalist, Louis Agassiz. In the early 1840s, he named two fossil fish species after her—Acrodus anningiae, and Belenostomus anningiae—and another after her friend Elizabeth Philpot. Agassiz was grateful for the help the women had given him in examining fossil fish specimens during his visit to Lyme Regis in 1834. After her death, other species, including the ostracod Cytherelloidea anningi, and two genera, the therapsid reptile genus Anningia, and the bivalve mollusc genus Anningella, were named in her honour. In 2012, the plesiosaur genus Anningasaura was named for her, and the species Ichthyosaurus anningae was named for her in 2015.|$|E

40|$|Combining {{work and}} family {{responsibilities}} is challenging when children have special needs, and mothers commonly make employment-related adjustments. In this study, the authors examined associations between maternal work absence and child language impairment and behavior problems in preschool <b>children.</b> Questionnaire data <b>at</b> <b>child</b> age 3 years from 33, 778 mothers participating in the prospective population-based Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study were linked to national register data on employment and long-term physician-certified sick leave <b>at</b> <b>child</b> age 3 - 5 years. Mothers who reported having a child with language impairment had a consistently higher risk of not being employed and were at increased risk of taking long-term sick leave <b>at</b> <b>child</b> age 5 years. Co-occurring problems were associated with excess risk. Language impairments in preschool children, in particular when they are co-occurring with behavior problems, {{are likely to have}} a range of negative short- and long-term consequences for the financial and overall health and well-being of mothers and their families...|$|R
