5|$|After {{many weeks}} of weather delays {{the first four}} men (Ben Partan, Rob Smith, Dave Anderson & Martin Bell) arrived from McMurdo on 11/9/04 and began to {{establish}} camp <b>and</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> skiway for the C130’s. Camp was established on {{the upper end of}} the ice stream at S77.76973 x W095.12713. The remaining members of the team arrived from Rothera approximately 10 days later in the Twin Otter, flown by survey pilot Dave Leatherdale.|$|E
5|$|Another committee, led by Oddvar Halvorsen, was {{established}} in 1960 {{to look at the}} matter again. Also it recommended a tunnel and a central station. However, it felt that the tunnel should be longer and intersect with the Drammen Line at a point between Skarpsno and Skøyen, <b>and</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> second station at Frogner. The proposal was presented to the Parliament of Norway on 4 November 1961, along with several other matters related to rail transport investments. Construction of the Oslo Tunnel and Oslo Central Station was passed unanimously.|$|E

5|$|As {{compensation}} for removing {{the track and}} field sections, the stadium company {{had to pay for}} a new municipal athletics venue at Mørkvedlia. The sales stadium's contract also required Aspmyra Eiendomsutvikling to build new change room facilities for the training pitch so the uses from teams had the same quality as the main pitch. The company was criticized by the municipality in 2002 for not prioritizing this obligation. The NOK170,000 it cost to move Grand's club house <b>and</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> change room for the artificial field was covered jointly by the municipality, Grand, Aspmyra Eiendomsutvikling and one of Glimt's sponsors, Nordland Entreprenør.|$|E
5|$|Being {{located just}} inside the Lions' Gate, {{one of the major}} entries to the Old City, the East Jerusalem Development Company {{initially}} intended to excavate the reservoir <b>and</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> multi-storey car park at the site. This post-1967 plan was rejected by the waqf authorities who own the plot because they feared that clearance work {{at the base of the}} Temple Mount would endanger the Haram compound. Subsequently, in 1981 a small square equipped with benches was constructed on part of the covered pool.|$|E
5|$|Between Turnham Green and Ravenscourt Park the District shared tracks with L steam {{trains to}} Richmond, a GWR steam service from Richmond to Ladbroke Grove and Midland coal trains. The District and L agreed to quadruple the tracks {{to allow a}} pair for the District's sole use <b>and</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> station on the District tracks at Stamford Brook. The line was first used on 3 December 1911 and Stamford Brook opened on 1 February 1912. However, the GWR had already {{withdrawn}} their service and L was to withdraw in 1916. A flying junction separating the Richmond and Hammersmith routes west of Earl's Court opened in January 1914.|$|E

After their eggs hatch, the parents keep the larvae clean of fungus and bacteria and help the larvae feed by regurgitating food for them.|$|E
5|$|Despite rising {{traffic to}} Las Vegas, WAE reduced {{service to the}} city amid the Great Depression. Once its {{financial}} situation improved, the airline bought the airfield and established a monopoly on flights. When the city attempted to purchase the field <b>and</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> more modern terminal, WAE refused. With the advent of World War II, however, WAE was pressured to sell the airfield. Nevadan Senator Pat McCarran helped obtain federal funding {{for the city to}} buy the field and construct a new terminal. He also helped establish a gunnery school by the United States Army Air Corps at the field. For the senator's contributions, the airport was named McCarran Field in 1941.|$|E
5|$|During late 1944 {{and early}} 1945 the Australian Army {{suffered}} from a shortage of shipping, leading to delays in moving heavy equipment and small watercraft from Australia to operational areas in the South West Pacific. While several British and United States vessels were eventually made available in mid-1945, the Australian Army's chief engineer, Major General Clive Steele, chose to design <b>and</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> heavy lift ship for the Army. Steele personally designed the ship, which was intended to support amphibious operations and transport supplies. He deliberately underestimated the project's cost {{in order to gain}} approval for the ship's design and construction.|$|E

5|$|During the War of 1812, {{during the}} summer of 1812 or 1813, Alder was elected captain of a company of 70 men formed in Plain City. With Frederick Loyd as his lieutenant, Alder's company was ordered by the Governor to march about twenty miles north <b>and</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> {{blockhouse}} at Mill Creek, about three miles north of Marysville, Ohio, to protect the Darby settlements. The company built and garrisoned the blockhouse for a few weeks, but when a false alarm was sounded regarding Indians attacking the settlements, the men returned to their homes. This was the only fort ever constructed in Union County, and some of the foundation is still visible today.|$|E
5|$|Dwarka's economy {{relies heavily}} on pilgrims and tourism but is {{supplemented}} by the production of millets, ghee (clarified butter), oilseeds, and salt, which are transported from its port. A long-term development plan was proposed in 2011 by the Government of Gujarat, with investment of ₹830 million to refurbish the city of Dwarka <b>and</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> bridge connecting the city with Okha and Bet Dwarka. Janmashtami is the main festival that is celebrated during August and September. Sharda Peeth Vidya Sabha is an educational society sponsored by the Sharda Peeth, Dwarka which runs an arts college in Dwarka. Dwarka was selected as a heritage city by the Indian government's Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana (HRIDAY) initiative.|$|E
5|$|Edward invaded {{with a huge}} army, pushing {{north from}} Carmarthen and westwards from Montgomery and Chester. Edward {{captured}} Aberconwy in March 1283 and decided that the location would form the centre of a new county: he would relocate the abbey eight miles up the Conwy valley to a new site at Maenan, establishing Maenan Abbey, <b>and</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> new English castle and walled town on the monastery's former site. The ruined castle of Deganwy was abandoned and never rebuilt. Edward's plan was a colonial enterprise and placing the new town and walls on top of such a high-status native Welsh site was in part a symbolic act to demonstrate English power.|$|E

Zod reveals that he possesses advanced terraforming equipment salvaged from Kryptonian outposts, which he intends to use to transform Earth into a new Krypton. His science officer, Jax-Ur, extracts Clark's genes to create Kryptonian colonists who will annihilate humanity <b>and</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> society based on Zod's ideals of genetic purity. With help from Jor-El, Clark and Lois flee and warn the U.S. military, just as Zod orders an invasion.|$|E
5|$|Hughes disliked loans, so he {{financed the}} {{purchase}} {{and development of}} new properties primarily through real estate limited partnerships (RELPs). At first, Public Storage built warehouses and sold them to independent RELPs for a development fee. The company's own RELP, called Public Storage Partners Ltd, was formed in 1975 and closed its first deal for $3 million in investments two years later. Public Storage paid cash to acquire property <b>and</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> self-storage facility, then used the property's income to pay investors back and earn a portion as profit. Public Storage Inc. also earned revenues from a portion of each deal that was made.|$|E
5|$|In 1898 {{a friend}} of Watts {{suggested}} to Henry Gamble, Vicar of St Botolph's Aldersgate, that should the church manage to purchase the land owned by the CPF {{it would make a}} suitable site for Watts's memorial. Watts was approached, and agreed to the suggestion. On 13October 1898 the appeal was relaunched, with the proposal that if the remaining £3,000 were raised, Watts would design <b>and</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> covered way, which in due course would be lined with memorial tablets to commemorate the bravery of ordinary people. Watts planned to build a covered way around three sides of a quadrangle, with the roof supported on stone or timber columns.|$|E

5|$|In 1937, {{construction}} {{began on}} a new concrete and brick-faced building to house the library. Completed in 1938, the building housed a collection that grew to 35,000 volumes in 1940. Now known as Smullin Hall, the library building was designed by architect Pietro Belluschi in the Georgian style of architecture. In 1965, the school received a $450,000 loan {{from the federal government}} for the library. Congressman Al Ullman worked to secure status as a Federal Depository Library in the late 1960s, with status conferred in 1969. In 1980, Willamette began a multi-year fund raising campaign intended to raise funds to renovate academic halls <b>and</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> new library, with $18 million total raised during the funding drive. At the time the library held a collection of 143,000 volumes.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, the Soviet Union {{originated}} Project 1144 Orlan, {{a project}} intended to design <b>and</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> large, nuclear powered anti-submarine vessel. At the time, the Soviets did not envisage that arming surface ships with anti-ship missiles was required, as then current doctrine {{had it that}} submarines were the main platform for attacking enemy shipping. However, {{the sinking of the}} Israeli destroyer INS Eilat in 1967 by anti-ship missiles fired from an Egyptian missile boat led to a re-think of the use of surface ships in the role. The threat of US Navy surface ships, which were increasingly capable of a range of different missions, led {{to the idea of a}} single ship combining anti-aircraft, anti-ship and anti-submarine capabilities crystalising.|$|E
