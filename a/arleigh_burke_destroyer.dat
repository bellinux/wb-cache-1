A surface ship subjected to an underwater explosion {{is exposed to}} shock waves over {{a short period of}} time which can vary in magnitude based on charge type, size, and location. The energy of those waves impinging upon the hull is transmitted throughout the ship's structure and vital equipment. The dynamics of the shock waves also influence the fluid surrounding the outer hull of the ship, creating an area of cavitating fluid. The combination of the shock waves, bubble pulsations, and cavitating fluid induce shipwide vibrations on hull supports and mission essential equipment which may become inoperative. In view of congressional requirements for new ship designs and systems to be shock tested, this thesis investigates the modeling of a preliminary design (Flight I) of the <b>Arleigh</b> <b>Burke</b> <b>Destroyer</b> (DDG 51) exposed to an underwater explosion. The effects of cavitation on one and two dimensional models is explored to determine if cavitation effects are substantially important to a three dimensional ship model. Validation of modeling underwater explosion effects upon a ship model can provide potential insight and savings in cost for future live fire testing and evaluation of the Flight IIA (DDG 79) design of the <b>Arleigh</b> <b>Burke</b> <b>Destroyer.</b> [URL] United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} study was to determine the relationship between operations tempo (OPTEMPO) and operational costs. This study was performed at the request and with the support of OPNAV N 82, the Office of Budget (FMB). The goal of this project was to increase the flexibility, scalability, and justifiability of the analytical model used by FMB to budget for ship operations. This study provides a detailed description of the model including modifications made by the only other study of the FMB budgeting model. The core of the analysis centered around a regression of OPTEMPO and expenditure data. From the resultant regression equations, incremental costs of ship operations could be distilled. However, during the preliminary data validation, significant correlations were found only within the <b>Arleigh</b> <b>Burke</b> <b>Destroyer</b> Class of ship. These correlations were likely spurious and due to the large number of new commissionings within that class over the period of study. The lack of ability to define any relationship between OPTEMPO and expenditures is possibly due to complete expenditure of fund allocations regardless of actual costs.

40|$|This thesis {{proposes to}} correct the {{shortfalls}} in the US Surface Combatants ability to counter a Sea-Control Navy. The concept counters this threat using unmanned aerial systems, decoys, and a layered defense. We analyze the performance with a Filtering Model of Salvo Warfare that {{is an extension of}} the Hughes Salvo Equations. The model incorporates the diluting effect of decoys upon enemy salvos and accounts for the historical reality of leakers. We conclude that in the absence of air support provided by US Carriers the warships that will have to reestablish sea control will be <b>Arleigh</b> <b>Burke</b> <b>Destroyers</b> based on current force composition. In summary, the thesis illustrates serious combat shortfalls in Surface Warfare of DDGs against a numerically superior Chinese Surface Action Group and proposes a reasonable solution of three key upgrades. The first upgrade is a long range TASM-like missile {{to correct the}} current DDG's lack of long range offensive missiles. The next two upgrades are both unmanned aerial systems. The Global Hawk maritime variant would provide offensive targeting data to surface combatants allowing for a successful first strike. The Fire Scout would provide local airborne early warning to allow for timely launches of decoys and defensive missiles. US Navy (USN) author...|$|R
