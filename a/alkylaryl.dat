In general, the diaryl sulfoxides (4, 5, and 7 - 9) showed much greater hypoxia selectivity (11 - 27 -fold) than the <b>alkylaryl</b> sulfoxides (3 -fold) (1 and 3). The fused diphenyl sulfoxides (10 and 11), on the other hand, showed very low hypoxia selectivity (1. 3 - 3 -fold).

The bioreduction of 8 by the rat S- 9 fraction under anaerobic conditions was inhibited by menadione and enhanced by benzaldehyde, acetaldehyde, or 2 -hydroxypyrimidine suggesting the involvement of aldehyde oxidase in the reduction of the sulfoxides.

The HASE polymer consists of complex <b>alkylaryl</b> hydrophobes composed of oligomeric nonylphenol condensates attached to a poly(ethyl acrylate-co-methacrylic acid) backbone. The complex linear viscoelastic response of the polymer in alkaline solution suggests an unentangled network with an appreciable fraction of microgel. The concentration and hydrophile−lipophile balance (HLB) of nonionic surfactants profoundly affect the solution rheology. A surfactant of high HLB inhibits the dynamic network connectivity of the HASE polymer, as demonstrated by reductions of both the steady-shear viscosity and the dynamic storage modulus. The shear-induced structuring previously reported for this polymer is also progressively diminished as the surfactant concentration is increased. In contrast, {{the addition of a}} low-HLB surfactant promotes system structuring, as evidenced by (i) increases in the shear viscosity and the high-frequency plateau modulus and (ii) retention of the ability to undergo shear-induced structuring. We also employ cryofracture-replication transmission electron microscopy {{for the first time with}} regard to HASE associative polymers to examine the morphological characteristics of selected systems. The morphology of the HASE polymer in both latex and solubilized form appears more complex than previously anticipated, and a reasonable interpretation of these new data is provided...|$|E

40|$|In this study, the {{solubilization}} of two organic dyes, Sudan I (1 -phenylazo- 2 -naphtol) and Quinizarin (1, 4 -dihydroxyanthraquinone), was {{studied in}} the presence of different types of surfactants (nonionic, anionic, cationic, and nonionic block copolymers) using UV-vis spectroscopy. The effects of temperature, pH and electrolyte on dye solubilization were investigated for single surfactants and for binary surfactant mixtures. The results showed that the solubilization of both dyes in the surfactant micelles increased with the temperature and with addition of salt {{and that there was no}} synergy when a mixture of surfactants was used. A straight chain alkyl tail seemed to be better than an <b>alkylaryl</b> tail, as judged from the comparison of solubilization power for the pairs sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) /sodium dodecyl benzene sulphonate (SDBS) and penta(ethylene glycol) monoundecyl ether (C 11 E 5) /nona(ethylene glycol) monononylphenyl ether (NPE 9). While the solubilization of both dyes {{in the presence of}} SOS and C 11 E 5 remained almost the same within the pH interval 3 - 12, the solubilization of the dyes was much higher above pH 8. 2 in the presence of the cationic surfactant dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide. This was attributed to an attractive interaction between the ionized form of the dye and the positively charged head group of the micellized surfactant...|$|E

40|$|We have {{previously}} reported the discovery and preliminary structure-activity relationships {{of a new}} class of inhibitors of varicella-zoster virus (VZV). These novel furanopyrimidine nucleosides bear unusual bicyclic base moieties and exhibit complete specificity for VZV. Limited in vitro cytotoxicity has been detected and the bicyclic nucleosides are now well established as a new family of potent antivirals. Our initial studies revealed an absolute requirement of a long alkyl side-chain, with an optimal chain length of C 8 -C 10, for antiviral activity. Following further studies, we recently reported a significant enhancement of both antiviral potency and selectivity by the inclusion of a phenyl group within the alkyl side-chain of these compounds. The new lead p-alkylphenyl analogues displayed EC 50 values below 1 nM versus VZV and selectivity index values > 1000000. We herein report the synthesis and characterization of a further series of <b>alkylaryl</b> analogues bearing terminal phenyl groups with varying n-alkyl side-chain lengths. Synthesis of the target bicyclic systems involved the Pd-catalysed coupling of terminal acetylenes with 5 -iodo- 2 '-deoxyuridine to give intermediate 5 -alkynyl nucleosides which were then cyclized in the presence of copper (I) iodide. The current compounds display excellent selectivity for VZV with no detectable in vitro cytotoxicity but despite being chemically isomeric with the previous lead p-alkylphenyl analogues, the compounds reported herein exhibit only moderate antiviral activities. A possible correlation between antiviral activity and conformational freedom of the side-chain is discussed. status: publishe...|$|E
