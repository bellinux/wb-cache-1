5|$|The rocks {{collected}} from the Moon are extremely old compared to rocks found on Earth, as measured by radiometric dating techniques. They {{range in age from}} about 3.2 billion years for the basaltic samples derived from the lunar maria, to about 4.6 billion years for samples derived from the highlands crust. As such, they represent samples from a very early period {{in the development of the}} Solar System, that are largely absent on Earth. One important rock found during the Apollo Program is dubbed the Genesis Rock, retrieved by astronauts David Scott and James Irwin during the Apollo 15 mission. This anorthosite rock is composed almost exclusively of the calcium-rich feldspar mineral <b>anorthite,</b> and is believed to be representative of the highland crust. A geochemical component called KREEP was discovered by Apollo 12, which has no known terrestrial counterpart. KREEP and the anorthositic samples have been used to infer that the outer portion of the Moon was once completely molten (see lunar magma ocean).|$|E
25|$|The {{pristine}} volcanic mineralogy of komatiites {{is composed}} of forsteritic olivine (Fo90 and upwards), calcic and often chromian pyroxene, <b>anorthite</b> (An85 and upwards) and chromite.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemical}} composition may vary between end member species {{of a solid}} solution series. For example, the plagioclase feldspars comprise a continuous series from sodium-rich end member albite (NaAlSi3O8) to calcium-rich <b>anorthite</b> (CaAl2Si2O8) with four recognized intermediate varieties between them (given in order from sodium- to calcium-rich): oligoclase, andesine, labradorite, and bytownite. Other examples of series include the olivine series of magnesium-rich forsterite and iron-rich fayalite, and the wolframite series of manganese-rich hübnerite and iron-rich ferberite.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} xenoliths occur in Lascar's rocks; {{a large amount}} of the phenocrysts are {{ultimately}} derived from them. Hornfels, skarn, and rocks derived from Lascar's lava dome ridge form these xenoliths. Minerals encountered in xenoliths include andradite, anhydrite, <b>anorthite,</b> apatite, biotite, calcite, diopside, fassaite, garnet, gypsum, ilmenite, magnetite, monazite, orthopyroxene, perovskite, plagioclase, prehnite, quartz, sphene, thorite, wilkeite, wollastonite and zircon. A number of such xenoliths formed from carbonate rocks that were influenced by magma from Lascar and from other volcanoes such as Tumisa.|$|E
25|$|Fly ash {{material}} solidifies while {{suspended in}} the exhaust gases and is collected by electrostatic precipitators or filter bags. Since the particles solidify rapidly while {{suspended in the}} exhaust gases, fly ash particles are generally spherical in shape and {{range in size from}} 0.5 µm to 300µm. The major consequence of the rapid cooling is that few minerals have time to crystallize, and that mainly amorphous, quenched glass remains. Nevertheless, some refractory phases in the pulverized coal do not melt (entirely), and remain crystalline. In consequence, fly ash is a heterogeneous material. SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3 and occasionally CaO are the main chemical components present in fly ashes. The mineralogy of fly ashes is very diverse. The main phases encountered are a glass phase, together with quartz, mullite and the iron oxides hematite, magnetite and/or maghemite. Other phases often identified are cristobalite, anhydrite, free lime, periclase, calcite, sylvite, halite, portlandite, rutile and anatase. The Ca-bearing minerals <b>anorthite,</b> gehlenite, akermanite and various calcium silicates and calcium aluminates identical to those found in Portland cement can be identified in Ca-rich fly ashes.|$|E
2500|$|Lascar rocks {{consist of}} {{andesite}} and dacite. These rocks have a [...] "2-pyroxene" [...] composition, although the old Piedras Grandes and Soncor rocks contain hornblende. Other minerals include anhydrite, augite, plagioclase, apatite, ilmenite, magnetite, olivine, orthopyroxene, phyrrotite, quartz, rhyolite in the groundmass, and spinel in inclusions. Dacite has more plagioclase and rhyolite. Component minerals found at Lascar include <b>anorthite,</b> augite bordering on diopside, bronzite, fassaite, forsterite, hypersthene, pigeonite and more.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the field}} of {{classical}} mineralogy, Hessel showed that the plagioclase feldspars could be considered solid solutions of albite and <b>anorthite.</b> [...] His analysis was published in 1826 (Taschenbuch für die gesammte Mineralogie, 20 , 289–333) but, as with {{his work on the}} crystal classes, it did not garner much attention among his contemporaries. [...] Rather, the theory of the composition of these feldspars was subsequently credited to Gustav Tschermak (1836 - 1927) in 1865.|$|E
2500|$|Feldspars are {{the most}} {{abundant}} group in the Earth's crust, at about 50%. In the feldspars, Al3+ substitutes for Si4+, which creates a charge imbalance that must {{be accounted for by}} the addition of cations. The base structure becomes either − or 2− [...] There are 22 mineral species of feldspars, subdivided into two major subgroups – alkali and plagioclase – and two less common groups – celsian and banalsite. The alkali feldspars are most commonly in a series between potassium-rich orthoclase and sodium-rich albite; in the case of plagioclase, the most common series ranges from albite to calcium-rich <b>anorthite.</b> Crystal twinning is common in feldspars, especially polysynthetic twins in plagioclase and Carlsbad twins in alkali feldspars. If the latter subgroup cools slowly from a melt, it forms exsolution lamellae because the two components – orthoclase and albite – are unstable in solid solution. Exsolution can be on a scale from microscopic to readily observable in hand-sample; perthitic texture forms when Na-rich feldspar exsolve in a K-rich host. The opposite texture (antiperthitic), where K-rich feldspar exsolves in a Na-rich host, is very rare.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anorthite</b> is the calcium-rich endmember of the {{plagioclase}} {{solid solution}} series, the other endmember being albite, NaAlSi3O8. <b>Anorthite</b> also refers to plagioclase compositions {{with more than}} 90 molecular percent of the <b>anorthite</b> endmember.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anorthite</b> is {{the calcium}} endmember of {{plagioclase}} feldspar. Plagioclase is an abundant mineral in the Earth's crust. The formula of pure <b>anorthite</b> is CaAl2Si2O8.|$|E
50|$|The lunar {{highland}} material <b>anorthite</b> {{can be used}} as aluminium ore. Smelters {{can produce}} pure aluminium, calcium metal, oxygen and silica glass from <b>anorthite.</b> Raw <b>anorthite</b> is also good for making fiberglass and other glass and ceramic products. One particular processing technique is to use fluorine brought from Earth as potassium fluoride to separate the raw materials from the lunar rocks.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anorthite</b> {{was named}} by Gustav Rose in 1823 from the Ancient Greek meaning oblique, {{referring}} to its triclinic crystallization. <b>Anorthite</b> is a comparatively rare mineral but {{occurs in the}} basic plutonic rocks of some orogenic calc-alkaline suites.|$|E
50|$|The {{composition}} of a plagioclase feldspar is typically denoted by its overall fraction of <b>anorthite</b> (%An) or albite (%Ab), and readily determined {{by measuring the}} plagioclase crystal's refractive index in crushed grain mounts, or its extinction angle in thin section under a polarizing microscope. The extinction angle is an optical characteristic and varies with the albite fraction (%Ab). There are several named plagioclase feldspars that fall between albite and <b>anorthite</b> in the series. The following table shows their compositions in terms of constituent <b>anorthite</b> and albite percentages.|$|E

50|$|Solid {{solutions}} between K-feldspar and albite {{are called}} alkali feldspar. Solid solutions between albite and <b>anorthite</b> are called plagioclase, or more properly plagioclase feldspar. Only limited solid solution occurs between K-feldspar and <b>anorthite,</b> {{and in the}} two other solid solutions, immiscibility occurs at temperatures common in the crust of the earth.

5000|$|Fresh magma {{changes the}} {{composition}} of the melt, changing the chemistry of the phases which are being precipitated. For instance, plagioclase conforms to the liquid line of descent by forming initial <b>anorthite</b> which, if removed, changes the equilibrium mineral composition to oligoclase or albite. Replenishment of the magma can see this trend reversed, so that more <b>anorthite</b> is precipitated atop cumulate layers of albite.|$|E

50|$|As an example, a magma of basalt {{composition}} that is precipitating cumulates of <b>anorthite</b> plagioclase plus enstatite pyroxene {{is changing}} composition by {{the removal of}} the elements which make up the precipitated minerals. In this example, the precipitation of <b>anorthite</b> (a calcium aluminium feldspar) removes calcium from the melt, which becomes more depleted in calcium. Enstatite being precipitated from the melt will remove magnesium, so the melt becomes depleted in these elements. This tends to enrich the concentration of other elements - typically sodium, potassium, titanium and iron.|$|E
