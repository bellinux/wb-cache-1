Because much of the vocabulary appeared to derive either from Aldhelm or from glossaries of the type called [...] "hermeneumata", I followed scholarly tradition and described the style as [...] "hermeneutic", {{on the assumption that}} the principal impulse behind the verbal display was that of dazzling the reader with arcane vocabulary exhumed from Greek-Latin glossaries and authors such as Aldhelm. I now suspect that the perception needs modification: that the authors' principal aim was not obfuscation, but was their (misguided, perhaps) attempt to reach in their prose a high stylistic register.|$|E

Among the creators involved are writers J. Michael Straczynski, Brian Azzarello, Darwyn Cooke, and Len Wein, and artists Lee Bermejo, J. G.

500|$|In 2009, Beckinsale {{starred in}} the comic-book {{adaption}} Whiteout as a U.S.Marshal tasked with investigating a murder in Antarctica. It was filmed in Manitoba, Canada. She found the action scenes less physically demanding than those in Underworld because [...] "three pairs of trousers and a parka gives you a bit more protection than the latex suit." [...] The film was critically panned and a box office failure, failing to recoup its budget. With critics consensus: Beckinsale is the lovely as ever, and does her best with the material, but moribund pacing and an uninspired plot leave Whiteout in the cold. She also made a brief cameo in the prequel she appeared in flashforwards composed of footage from 2003's Underworld. Also in 2009, Beckinsale {{starred in the}} family drama Everybody's Fine alongside Robert De Niro, Drew Barrymore, and Rockwell, her Snow Angels co-star. Beckinsale was excited by {{the opportunity to work}} with De Niro, whom she had first encountered [...] "years and years <b>ago</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> just had Lily and he was putting together a reading of The Good Shepherd.". Everybody's Fine was a box office flop, failing to recoup its production budget. In May 2010, Beckinsale sat on the nine-member 2010 Cannes Film Festival jury, chaired by director Tim Burton. Unable to find a script she felt passionate about, Beckinsale kept a low profile in 2010 and 2011, opting to spend time with her daughter.|$|E
