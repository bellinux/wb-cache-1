25|$|The {{murder of}} cab driver Monier Gindy on January 4, 2007, in Marrero, Louisiana, was not <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> <b>incident.</b> Ever since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, cab drivers have {{increasingly}} been {{the targets of}} criminals terrorizing the New Orleans metropolitan area. The president of United Cab discourages his drivers from carrying firearms, instead advising them to accelerate the car and crash into a lamppost or even a police car if they are threatened with a gun.|$|E

25|$|There {{is another}} Nattapara in Hooghly district, a remote village in Balagarh block. There are some 100 dhakis in the village. There {{is not a}} single family without a dhaki. All used to go out to work as dhakis during the festive season, but now the demand has {{declined}} {{to such an extent that}} many are forced to give up the traditional profession and work as wage labourers. Worse still, a dhaki from the village was contacted by a well-known Durga Puja in Kolkata for Rs. 2,000. After he had performed his duties they paid him less and insulted him. It is not <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> <b>incident</b> and there are similar complaints from dhakis in the Tarakeswar and Dhaniakhali regions.|$|E
25|$|The first {{skirmish}} of the New Zealand Wars was the 1843 Wairau Affray at {{the north}} end of the South Island. It was <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> <b>incident</b> caused by the Nelson settlers trying to seize land they did not own, an extra-legal vigilante action that resulted in twenty-two of them being killed. The Flagstaff or Northern War took place in the far north of New Zealand, around the Bay of Islands, in March 1845 and January 1846. This was about mana—tribal prestige—and customs duties. It was really a war between rival Māori chiefs with the British fighting on one side for the prestige of the British Empire. This was followed almost immediately by the Hutt Valley Campaign, March to August 1846, and the Wanganui Campaign, April to July 1847, in the south-west of the North Island. Both these conflicts were about the encroachment of the European settlers onto Māori land. In the first three wars Māori fought the British to a standstill each time. From the engagements emerged an understanding: English law prevailed in the townships and settlements, and Māori law and customs elsewhere. There followed a period of relative peace and economic cooperation from 1848 to 1860.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} anti-disco {{incidents}} took place {{elsewhere in the}} first half of 1979, showing that [...] "the Disco Demolition was not <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> <b>incident</b> or an aberration." [...] In Seattle, hundreds of rock fans attacked a mobile dance floor, while in Portland, Oregon, a disc jockey destroyed a stack of disco records with a chainsaw as thousands looked on and cheered. In New York, a rock deejay played Donna Summer's sexualized disco hit, [...] "Hot Stuff"; he received protests from his listeners.|$|E
50|$|Following {{a series}} of inquiries, both in the Knesset and within the IDF, it was {{determined}} that the distribution of the alleged booklets took place in <b>a</b> few <b>isolated</b> <b>incidents,</b> by non-military personnel, without proper supervision of Military Rabbinate representatives. Following this incident, guidelines were set to ensure the authority of both the Military Rabbinate and the Education and Youth Corps within the IDF.|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} and the fall of 1878, {{settlers}} and freighters were fearful of {{the continuation of the}} Bannock War and ongoing troubles with the Nez Perce Indians. There were only <b>a</b> few <b>isolated</b> <b>incidents</b> that did affect travel. The worst involved freighters and Bannock Indians along the Lost River. In this incident, natives killed the leader of the freight train as well as five oxen and three horses. In other incidents, Natives burnt haystacks and let stock loose.|$|R

For the most part, <b>a</b> single <b>isolated</b> <b>incident</b> will not be enough to prove hostile environment harassment unless it involves extremely outrageous and egregious conduct. The courts will try to decide whether the conduct is both [...] "serious" [...] and [...] "frequent." [...] Supervisors, managers, co-workers and even customers can be responsible for creating a hostile environment.|$|R
500|$|A minor {{incident}} occurred involving blind Member of Parliament David Blunkett, who was attending {{the opening ceremony}} alongside a Channel 4 director.

However, Blunkett noted that this was <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> <b>incident</b> and chose not to make an issue of it, simply advising organisers to [...] "seek to find a solution rather than impose a preconceived notion of what is or is not possible." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{a review}} of the source {{material}} related to the AD 52 naumachia, Leon observes that the fighters were not gladiators but were convicted criminals sentenced to death.

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} murder, later-disbarred American {{attorney}} Jack Thompson, who has campaigned against violence in video games, {{claimed that he}} had written to Rockstar after the game was released, warning them {{that the nature of}} the game could inspire copycat killings; [...] "I wrote warning them that somebody was going to copycat the Manhunt game and kill somebody. We have had dozens of killings in the U.S. by children who had played these types of games. This is not <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> <b>incident.</b> These types of games are basically murder simulators. There are people being killed over here almost on a daily basis".

50|$|The {{attempted}} assassination had {{no impact}} on Japanese policies towards the Korean peninsula, and was quickly dismissed in Japan as <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> terrorist <b>incident.</b> However, the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea hailed the event {{as evidence of the}} ongoing opposition to Japanese rule in Korea. When these sentiments were echoed in the newspaper of the ruling Kuomintang party in the Republic of China, the Japanese government formally issued a diplomatic protest, and the issue led to an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment in Japan at a time when relations were already extremely strained.|$|R
50|$|President Sirleaf {{declared}} {{the day of}} the referendum a public holiday. The referendum was overseen by 1,949 registered domestic and international observers, including officials from the National Democratic Institute, International Foundation for Electoral Systems, the African Union Civil Society Group and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Voting was held at 4,457 stations across the country and proceeded peacefully, with only <b>a</b> single <b>isolated</b> <b>incident</b> of violence reported in Barclayville. However, the vote was marked by low turnout and confusion regarding the reasons for the referendum. Several women's advocacy groups criticized the government for a lack of awareness among women regarding the referendum.|$|R

500|$|During the {{aftermath}} of the murder of Stefan Pakeerah, by his friend Warren Leblanc in Leicestershire, England, the game Manhunt was linked after the media wrongfully claimed police found a copy in Leblanc's room. The police officially denied any link, citing drug-related robbery as the motive and revealing that the game had been found in Pakeerah's bedroom, not Leblanc's. Thompson, who had heard of the murder, claimed that he had written to Rockstar after the game was released, warning them that the nature of the game could inspire copycat killings: [...] "I wrote warning them that somebody was going to copycat the Manhunt game and kill somebody.

500|$|It was at {{this time}} that the pan-Islamic Khilafat Movement began in India. Gandhi, until then {{relatively}} unknown on the Indian political scene, began emerging as a mass leader. His call for protests against the Rowlatt Act achieved an unprecedented response of furious unrest and protests. The situation—especially in Punjab—deteriorated rapidly, with disruptions of rail, telegraph, and communication systems. The movement peaked {{in the first week of}} April, with some recording that [...] "practically the whole of Lahore was on the streets; the immense crowd that passed through Anarkali was estimated to be around 20,000." [...] In Amritsar, over 5,000 people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh. The situation deteriorated perceptibly over the next few days. The British feared that a more sinister conspiracy for rebellion was brewing under the veneer of peaceful protests. O'Dwyer is said to have believed that these were the early and ill-concealed signs of a coordinated uprising—on the lines of the 1857 revolt—that he expected to take place in May, when British troops would have withdrawn to the hills for the summer. Contrary to being <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> <b>incident,</b> the Amritsar massacre—as well as responses to other events that preceded and succeeded it—was the end result of a concerted plan of response from the Punjab administration to suppress such a conspiracy. James Houssemayne Du Boulay is said to have ascribed a direct relationship between the fear of a Ghadarite uprising in the midst of an increasingly tense situation in Punjab and the British response that ended in the massacre.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the extent}} and {{prevalence}} of violence in relationships, counselors and therapists are encouraged to assess every client for domestic violence (both experienced and perpetrated). If the clinician is seeing a couple for couple's counseling, this assessment should be conducted with each individual privately during the initial interview, {{in order to increase}} the victim's sense of safety in disclosing any violence in the relationship. In addition to determining whether violence is present, counselors and therapists should also make the distinction between situations where battering may have been <b>a</b> single, <b>isolated</b> <b>incident</b> or <b>an</b> ongoing pattern of control. The therapist must, however, consider that violence may be present even when there has been only a single physical incident as emotional/verbal, economic, and sexual abuse may be more insidious.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{critical}} look on <b>an</b> <b>isolated,</b> failed <b>incident</b> of protest {{carried out by}} a young Puerto Rican woman and her two children. In doing so, it explores the possibilities of radical political thought and action on the island. Furthermore, by situating this event within {{the larger context of}} danger—physical, social and discursive—that women in Puerto Rico are subjected to, it seeks to question the manner in which female protestors’ vulnerability and agency challenge those on the left to formulate gender-progressive strategies for emancipation. Lastly, it is argued here that this protestor features as new type of radical political subject on the island that could very well serve as a figurehead for large-scale social movements arising from a shared sense of precarity...|$|R
25|$|A {{more direct}} {{manifestation of the}} growing {{reaction}} against secularism was {{the revival of the}} Sufi brotherhoods. Not only did suppressed Sufi orders such as the Kadiri, Mevlevi, Nakşibendi, Khālidiyyā and Al-Ṭarīqah al-Tijāniyyah reemerge, but new movements were formed, including the Nur Cemaati, Gülen movement, Sülaymānīyyā, Community of İskenderpaşa and İsmailağa. The Tijāni became especially militant in confronting the state. For example, Tijāni damaged monuments to Atatürk to symbolize their opposition to his policy of secularization. This was however <b>a</b> very <b>isolated</b> <b>incident</b> and only involved one particular Sheikh of the order. Throughout the 1950s, there were numerous trials of Ticani and other Sufi leaders for antistate activities. Simultaneously, however, some movements, notably the Süleymancı and Nurcular, cooperated with those politicians perceived as supportive of pro-Islamic policies. The Nurcular eventually advocated support for Turkey's multiparty political system, and one of its offshoots, the Gülen movement, had supported the True Path Party while the Işıkçılar and Enver Ören had openly supported the Motherland Party since the mid-1980s.|$|R
5000|$|Where {{a hostile}} {{environment}} is alleged, the legality of behaviors must be determined {{on a case by}} case basis. In the workplace, such a claim focuses on the working conditions that must be endured by the victim as a condition of employment, rather than on tangible job changes. To establish whether the situation is actionable the [...] "totality of circumstances" [...] must be weighed with an eye to determining [...] "that the harassment affected a term, condition, or privilege of employment in that it was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the condition of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment". To {{rise to the level of}} hostile environment, the behavior must be frequent, severe and pervasive.

In 2005, Grant-Ferris admitted 20 incidents of child abuse. This was not <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> <b>incident</b> and involved other monks and lay members.

2500|$|The War of Independence {{begun in}} 1919, {{following}} {{the declaration of}} an Irish Republic and its parliament, Dáil Éireann. The army of the new republic, the Irish Republican Army (IRA), waged guerrilla warfare against British forces: the British Army and the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC). To help fight the IRA, the British Government formed the Auxiliary Division. This was a paramilitary unit composed of ex-soldiers from Britain which specialised in counter-insurgency and recruited thousands of British ex-soldiers into the RIC, who became known as [...] "Black and Tans". IRA intelligence officer Florence O'Donoghue claimed the subsequent burning and looting of Cork was [...] "not <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> <b>incident,</b> but rather the large-scale application of a policy initiated and approved, implicitly or explicitly, by the British government".|$|E
2500|$|The Bush {{administration}} did not initially acknowledge the abuses at Abu Ghraib. After the pictures were published and the evidence became incontrovertible, the initial reaction from the administration characterized the scandal as <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> <b>incident</b> uncharacteristic of U.S. actions in Iraq. Bush described the abuses as {{the actions of a}} few individuals, who were disregarding the [...] values of the US. This view was widely disputed, notably in Arab countries. In addition, the International Red Cross had been making representations about abuse of prisoners {{for more than a year}} before the scandal broke. Scholars studying the abuses have stated that the abuses were part of a widespread pattern. Vice-president Dick Cheney's office had played a central role in eliminating limits on coercion in U.S. custody, commissioning and defending legal opinions that the administration later portrayed as the initiatives of lower-ranking officials.

50|$|After a {{thorough}} investigation led by a special committee of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the committee concluded that there were clear signs of incompetence, but none of malfeasance that would have warranted further investigation. The SEC had hoped {{to figure out the}} causes of wrongdoing in order to pass legislation that would prevent further mishaps, but it did not find any evidence of such behavior. In its report, the SEC concluded that the downturn in the market was due to “a complex interaction of causes and effects—including rational and emotional motivations as well as a variety of mechanisms and pressures,” which led to a “downward spiral of great velocity and force.” The end of the report labeled the market slide as <b>an</b> <b>isolated,</b> nonrecurring <b>incident</b> with precipitating causes that were unable to be confidently ascertained.|$|R
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is proposed}} for recognizing {{the symptoms of}} persistent problems in large systems. The system error rate is used to identify the error states among which relationships may exist. Statistical techniques are used to validate and quantify {{the strength of the}} relationship among these error states. As input, the approach takes the raw error logs containing a single entry for each error that is detected as <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> event. <b>As</b> output, it produces a list of symptoms that characterize persistent errors. Thus, given a failure, it is determined whether the failure is an intermittent manifestation of a common fault or whether it is <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> (transient) <b>incident.</b> The technique is shown to work on two CYBER systems and an IBM 3081 multiprocessor system. Comparisons to real failure/repair information obtained from field engineers show that, in about 85 percent of the cases, the error symptoms recognized by this approach correspond to real problems. The remaining 15 percent of the cases, although not directly supported by field data, are confirmed as being valid problems...|$|R
