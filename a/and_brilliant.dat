30|$|His female portraits are {{characterized}} by exuberant accessories {{and a lot of}} makeup, especially big smoky eyes, which label his Parisian life. He said in 1921 “All women have their beauty, their charm that I exalt. Now we have long legs, long legs of Diane the Huntress, arched feet, […] long line so supple […]; big eyes - I don’t know why -, long lashes, satin-soft or matte skin […], pearls <b>and</b> <b>brilliants.</b> <b>And</b> <b>brilliants</b> have to shine and why would I not make the pearls bigger?” [1, p. 171]. In 1959, he moved to Monaco where he died in 1968 [1].|$|R
5|$|The last {{work in the}} {{published}} set was written before numbers four and five. It was originally a harp piece, composed for a competition at the Paris Conservatoire in 1904.

5|$|Although Steinitz's play changed abruptly, he {{said had}} been {{thinking}} along such lines for some years: Some of the games which I saw Paulsen play during the London Congress of 1862 gave a still stronger start to the modification of my own opinions, which has since developed, and I began to recognize that Chess genius {{is not confined to}} the more or less deep <b>and</b> <b>brilliant</b> finishing strokes after the original balance of power and position has been overthrown, but that it also requires the exercise of still more extraordinary powers, though perhaps of a different kind to maintain that balance or respectively to disturb it at the proper time in one's own favor.|$|E
5|$|Ceramic {{industry}} consumes {{a significant}} amount of zinc oxide, in particular in ceramic glaze and frit compositions. The relatively high heat capacity, thermal conductivity and high temperature stability of ZnO coupled with a comparatively low coefﬁcient of expansion are desirable properties in the production of ceramics. ZnO affects the melting point and optical properties of the glazes, enamels, and ceramic formulations. Zinc oxide as a low expansion, secondary ﬂux improves the elasticity of glazes by reducing the change in viscosity as a function of temperature and helps prevent crazing and shivering. By substituting ZnO for BaO and PbO, the heat capacity is decreased and the thermal conductivity is increased. Zinc in small amounts improves the development of glossy <b>and</b> <b>brilliant</b> surfaces. However, in moderate to high amounts, it produces matte and crystalline surfaces. With regard to color, zinc has a complicated inﬂuence.|$|E
50|$|The star {{consists}} of a blue enameled central disc, with placed on it seven golden stars, topped with brilliants, representing {{the stars of the}} cluster Pleiades. The disc is surrounded by a white enamel and gold edged ring with twenty-four stars thereon, made of gold <b>and</b> <b>brilliants.</b> This as a whole is surrounded by six open ornaments, shaped as large double loops in gold; with between the ornaments partly white enameled, small shell-shaped designs. The disc is topped by a stylized imperial Pahlavi Crown, enameled in different colors and enriched with carbuncles <b>and</b> <b>brilliants.</b> At the back a pin is attached to wear the star on the left breast.|$|R
50|$|The sash {{badge of}} the second class is almost {{identical}} to the badge of the first class, but instead the medallion and the stars on it are made in silver gilt only. Similarly, the crown is enameled without the carbuncles <b>and</b> <b>brilliants.</b>|$|R

5|$|Prior to her infestation, Kerrigan is {{described}} as being a graceful and deadly woman, exceedingly agile and athletic, possessing jade-green eyes <b>and</b> <b>brilliant</b> red hair usually worn as a ponytail.

Kerrigan is rarely seen out of her armor, a form-fitting hostile environment suit specifically designed for Ghost operatives and equipped with a personal cloaking device, but when off-duty, she {{is described}} as wearing a soft work shirt, worn cotton pants with a dusty leather jacket, and high leather boots. Even then, it is uncommon for Kerrigan to be unarmed: she is always equipped {{with at least a}} combat knife.|$|E
