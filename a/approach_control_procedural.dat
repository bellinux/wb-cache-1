40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} three organisational factors, namely, the ethical environment, scope of risk management and internal audit activities on accounting <b>control</b> <b>procedural</b> quality. Based on a questionnaire survey of a 64 Australian firms, data are analysed using a structural equation model. The {{results of the study}} support (1) a direct and positive relationship between ethical environment and accounting control rocedural quality, and (2) an indirect relationship between the scope of risk management and accounting <b>control</b> <b>procedural</b> quality mediated by the extent of internal audit activity within the organisation. Our findings suggest that accounting <b>control</b> <b>procedural</b> quality may be enhanced by fostering a more ethical environment, and by undertaking more extensive internal audit activities as the scope of risk management increases. This study provides empirical evidence in an area where such evidence is scant and highlights the significant inter-relationships that exists within a network of internal controls comprising ethical environment, risk management, internal audit and accounting-based controls...|$|R

Aircraft were routed onto {{specific}} airways ("tracks"), given [...] "clearances" [...] onto those airways ("train orders"), and times were estimated and reported as they passed reporting points along those airways ("stations") in order to detect and avoid conflicts.

40|$|This article {{contains}} a case analysis of the Biannual International Mandarin Intervarsity Debating Competition jointly staged by China Central Television as a new genre of what I regard as enhanced propaganda. The analysis has been informed by a brief examination {{of the history of}} the genre, which invites attention to its importance as a symbol of both China's cultural superiority and its progress towards democracy and freedom of speech. However, the analysis has found that, under the disguise of its symbolism, the genre is subjected to very strict controls. The case analysis categorized four heuristic types of control, which I call content <b>control,</b> <b>procedural</b> <b>control,</b> semiotic control and interpretative control. The findings of the analysis, to be discussed in this article, will show how the various types of control are intended to eliminate alternative messages in what is seemingly an improvised show. This, I hope, will contribute to a challenge of the popular perception that Chinese television has been liberalized...|$|R

40|$|NASA's Next Generation Satellite Laser Ranging (NGSLR) {{station is}} the {{prototype}} for NASA's Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) systems {{which will be}} deployed {{around the world in}} the coming decade. The NGSLR system will be an autonomous, photon-counting SLR station with an expected absolute range accuracy of better than one centimeter and a normal point (time-averaged) range precision better than one millimeter. The system provides continuous (weather permitting), 24 hour tracking coverage to an existing constellation of approximately two dozen artificial satellites equipped with passive retroreflector arrays, using pulsed, 532 nm, class IV laser systems. Current details on the approved laser systems {{can be found in the}} Appendix 1 of this document. This safety plan addresses the potential hazards to emitted laser radiation, which can occur both inside and outside the shelter. Hazards within the shelter are mitigated through posted warning signs, activated warning lights, <b>procedural</b> <b>controls,</b> personal protective equipment (PPE), laser curtains, beam blocking systems, interlock controls, pre-configured laser control settings, and other controls discussed in this document. Since the NGSLR is a satellite tracking system, laser hazards exist outside the shelter to personnel on the shelter roof and to passing aircraft. Potential exposure to personnel outside the system is mitigated through the use of posted warning signs, access <b>control,</b> <b>procedural</b> <b>controls,</b> a stairwell interlock, beam attenuation/blocking devices, and a radar based aircraft detection system...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis {{is to develop a}} model for {{designing}} a quality <b>control</b> <b>procedural</b> description with respect to cultural differences. This project is conducted at the case company. The problem in the case company is to analyse the existing procedural description of quality control to develop a model to improve the quality control of production with respect to different cultures. The authors visit the case company to collect essential information to accomplish the thesis, face-to-face user interviews, Question & Answer via email. The knowledge gained on different quality tools during studies at School of Technology and Design (Terotechnology) for the basis of this research. The plan of this thesis uses the different quality tools and techniques to solve the problem by analyzing, mapping the existing processes. The analysis is based on theoretical and empirical facts, also different quality tools like process mapping, cause & effect diagram and flowchart are use to identify the problem and relevant suggestions have been proposed to improve their current situation. In the results and conclusions the authors explain a model for designing a quality <b>control</b> <b>procedural</b> description. The authors believed by implementing the suggested improved model company can address their quality issues, which will improve the productivity to a greater extent and enable them to achieve their goal of continuous improvement. Communication is main factor in this thesis. In the case company there is such as no main problem of low or bad quality in the product. Occurrence is more important to develop good relations with the suppliers. Continuously repeat of the specification and demand over & over again is very important for clear communication between buyer & seller as well as feed back and follow up of the order from both parties...|$|R

40|$|There is {{consensus}} {{within the}} U. S. Army that the Army Airspace Command and Control (A 2 C 2) system is ineffective in coordinating airspace users to accomplish assigned missions. The two comprehensive studies completed {{within the past}} decade cite the basic reasons for its failure as the Army's inability to follow its own doctrine. However, critically lacking within the studies is {{an analysis of the}} validity of the doctrine itself. The current basis of A 2 C 2 doctrine is the primary reliance upon <b>procedural</b> <b>control,</b> essentially de-conflicting airspace through the use of graphical control measures.
