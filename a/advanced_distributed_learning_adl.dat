30|$|An {{expectation}} for the teacher-learning {{process in}} the future was articulated in the mid- 1980 s for guiding what became the DoD <b>Advanced</b> <b>Distributed</b> <b>Learning</b> Initiative (<b>ADL)</b> (Fletcher et al. 2007). The idea was that education and training would rely much less on classroom instruction and would primarily consist of tutorial conversations between a computer-like device 2 and learners or workers seeking assistance to perform a task. The computer/device would not need to store locally all the data and information needed. Instead it would draw most of that, as needed and on demand, from the global information infra-sphere, which would store all of human knowledge {{in a form that}} could be downloaded to whatever device the learner had at hand (Dodds and Fletcher 2004). 3 The basic idea, long pursued by the Department of Defense (e.g., Fletcher 2009), was to avoid the time and costs of developing (“authoring”) education and training by leaving as much of that as possible to the computer—to be assembled online and in real time.|$|R

50|$|Though the {{original}} model {{from which the}} Handle System derives dealt with management of digital objects, the Handle System does not mandate any particular model of relationships between the identified entities, nor is it limited to identifying only digital objects: non-digital entities may be represented as a corresponding digital object {{for the purposes of}} digital object management. Some care is needed in the definition of such objects and how they relate to non-digital entities; there are established models that can aid in such definitions (e.g., Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR), CIDOC CRM, and indecs content model. Some applications have found it helpful to marry such a framework to the handle application: for example, the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Distributed</b> <b>Learning</b> (<b>ADL)</b> Initiative brings together Handle System application with existing standards for distributed learning content, using a Shareable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM), and the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) system implementation of the Handle System has adopted it together with the indecs framework to deal with semantic interoperability.|$|E
