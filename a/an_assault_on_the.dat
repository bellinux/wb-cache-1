5|$|In England {{the brigade}} {{went into a}} period of {{recruitment}} and training, concentrating on house to house street fighting in the bombed areas of Southampton and Birmingham. The training programme culminated in Exercise Eve, <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> River Thames, which was intended to simulate the River Rhine in Germany.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Prague, Christof {{finds the}} Tzimisce in nearby Vyšehrad Castle have been {{revealed}} to the humans, who have launched <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> structure. Christof, Wilhem, and Serena infiltrate the castle and find that the powerful, slumbering Vukodlak has enslaved Anezka as a ghoul. Anezka rejects Christof and prepares to revive Vukodlak, but the outside assault collapses the castle upon them.|$|E
5|$|In 1801 while {{aboard the}} 74-gun HMS Ganges (commanded by Captain Thomas Fremantle, a {{personal}} friend), Brock {{was present at}} the Battle of Copenhagen. His troops were supposed to lead <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forts at Copenhagen. The outcome of the sea battle made such an assault unnecessary, and Brock was able to observe first-hand the tactical brilliance of Lord Nelson. After the battle, Fremantle and Brock celebrated the victory with Nelson. In 1802 Brock and the 49th Foot were ordered to Canada.|$|E

5|$|In early November, Vandegrift, {{fearing that}} the Japanese were {{planning}} <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Lunga perimeter {{from the east}} using Shōji's forces plus additional reinforcements, launched an operation against the Japanese units at Koli Point. Beginning on 4 November, two battalions of U.S. Marines and two battalions of U.S. Army troops attacked and attempted to encircle Shōji's men at Gavaga Creek {{near the village of}} Tetere in the Koli Point area.|$|E
5|$|Initially, de Peyster {{had been}} {{selected}} to lead <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> breastworks outside the city, however {{the night before the}} assault he noticed the city aflame from a signal tower and informed General Weitzel. The men of the corps then entered the city unmolested. Admiral David Farragut later claimed that de Peyster was due as much credit as he would have received had he actually taken the city by storming it, because doing it without bloodshed still carried the same intent.|$|E
5|$|On 10 August the Imperial Japanese Army, {{which had}} been slowly pushing south to Port Arthur, began <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> city's outer defenses.

5|$|On November 7, 1862, Maj. Gen. McClellan {{was removed}} from command of the Army of the Potomac and {{replaced}} with Maj. Gen. Burnside. Over the course of November, Burnside moved the army south to Falmouth, Virginia, opposite the Rappahannock River from Fredericksburg. The 21st arrived in Falmouth on November 19. Nearly a month passed before Burnside could organize a crossing {{of the river and}} <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> city and the heights beyond. The Battle of Fredericksburg took place on December 13, 1862.|$|E
5|$|The {{immediate}} {{response of the}} British was a two-hour cannon barrage at the heights, which had no effect because the British guns could not reach the American guns at such height. After {{the failure of the}} barrage, Howe and his officers agreed that the colonists must be removed from the heights if they were to hold Boston. They planned <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> heights; however, due to a storm the attack never took place, and the British elected instead to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|The story {{focuses on}} Class Zero, {{a group of}} {{fourteen}} students from the Vermillion Peristylium, a magical academy in the Dominion of Rubrum. When the Militesi Empire launches <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other Crystal States of Orience, seeking to control their respective crystals, Class Zero is mobilized {{for the defense of}} Rubrum. Eventually, the group becomes entangled in the secrets behind both the war and the reason for their existence. The setting and presentation were inspired by historical documentaries, and the story itself was written to be darker than other Final Fantasy titles.|$|E

5|$|Bond and Octopussy return {{separately}} to India. Bond {{arrives at}} Khan's palace just as Octopussy and her troops have launched <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grounds. Octopussy attempts to kill Khan, but is captured by Gobinda. While Octopussy's team, led by Magda, overpower Khan's guards, Khan and Gobinda abandon the palace, taking Octopussy as a hostage. Bond pursues {{them as they}} attempt to escape in their plane, clinging to the fuselage and disabling the tailplanes. In a struggle with Bond, Gobinda takes a deadly plummet off the roof of the plane and Bond rescues Octopussy from Khan, the pair jumping onto a nearby cliff only seconds before the plane crashes into a mountain, killing Khan. While M and General Gogol discuss the transport of the jewelery, Bond recuperates with Octopussy aboard her private boat in India.|$|E
5|$|By mid-November, the Germans {{had nearly}} taken Stalingrad in bitter street {{fighting}} when the Soviets began their second winter counter-offensive, starting with an encirclement of German forces at Stalingrad and <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Rzhev salient near Moscow, though the latter failed disastrously. By early February 1943, the German Army had taken tremendous losses; German troops at Stalingrad {{had been forced}} to surrender, and the front-line had been pushed back beyond its position before the summer offensive. In mid-February, after the Soviet push had tapered off, the Germans launched another attack on Kharkov, creating a salient in their front line around the Russian city of Kursk.|$|E

5|$|Derrick then {{returned}} to his platoon, where he gathered his first and third sections in preparation for <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> three remaining machine gun posts in the area. Attacking the posts, Derrick personally rushed forward on four separate occasions and threw his grenades at a range of about , before all three were silenced. Derrick's platoon held their position that night, before the 2/48th Battalion moved in to take Sattelberg unopposed the following morning. The battalion commander insisted that Derrick personally hoist the Australian flag over the town; it was raised at 10:00 on 25 November 1943.|$|E
5|$|French {{military}} planners had to balance competing demands for the 1781 campaign. After the unsuccessful American attempts of co-operation leading to failed assaults at Rhode Island and Savannah, they realised more {{active participation in}} North America was needed. However, they also needed to co-ordinate their actions with Spain, where there was potential interest in making <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> British stronghold of Jamaica. It {{turned out that the}} Spanish were not interested in operations agaynst Jamaica until after they had dealt with an expected British attempt to reinforce besieged Gibraltar, and merely wanted to be informed of the movements of the West Indies fleet.|$|E
5|$|Further east, the strongpoint {{defenses}} were effective. On the Dog Red / Easy Green boundary, {{the defenses}} around the Les Moulins strongpoint took a heavy {{toll on the}} remaining 2nd Battalion, with H/116 and headquarters elements struggling ashore there. The survivors joined the remnants of F/116 behind the shingle, and here the battalion commander was able to organize 50 men for an improvised advance across the shingle. A further advance up the bluffs just east of Les Moulins {{was too weak to}} have any effect and was forced back down. To their left, mainly between the draws on the Easy Green / Easy Red boundary, the 116th RCT's support battalion landed without too much loss, although they did become scattered, and were too disorganized to play any immediate part in <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bluffs.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Caxias had {{organized}} <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> new Paraguayan defenses which López had thrown {{up along the}} Pikysyry, south of Asunción (Paraguay's capital). This stream afforded a strong defensive position which was anchored by the Paraguay River and by the swampy jungle of the Chaco region. Caxias had a road cut through the supposedly impenetrable Chaco, located {{on the other side}} of the Paraguayan River where the Allied army was camped. The Brazilian ships carried the Allied troops across the river, where they moved over the road which had been finished in December. The Allied forces outflanked the Paraguayan lines and attacked from the rear. The combined allied forces annihilated the Paraguayan army and on 1 January 1869 Asunción was occupied.|$|E
5|$|Mid-way in the march, Frederick finally {{realized}} that he would end up facing his enemy, instead of approaching from behind. Furthermore, a row of ponds forced him to break his line into three narrow columns, exposing it to full Russian fire power. Frederick changed his dispositions; the Prussian right vanguard would concentrate east of the ponds of Kunersdorf and make <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Mühlberge. Frederick calculated that he could turn the Austrian-Russian flank, and push the Russians off the Mühlberge heights. His redeployment took time, and the apparent hesitation in the assault confirmed to Saltykov what Frederick planned; he moved more troops around so that the strongest line would face the Prussian onslaught.|$|E
5|$|ODST {{takes place}} in the 26th century, when humans under the command of the United Nations Space Command (UNSC) are locked in a war with a theocratic {{alliance}} of alien races known as the Covenant.

Though the UNSC manages to repel most of the fleet, a large ship hovers over the city, depositing an invasion force. The ship eventually retreats via a slipspace jump, creating a massive shockwave. While the rest of Halo 2s storyline follows the ship to an ancient installation identical to the first Halo, ODST focuses on the aftermath of the shockwave, while the Covenant still occupy the city.|$|E
