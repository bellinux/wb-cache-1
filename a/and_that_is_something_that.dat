[...] Thinking {{back to his own}} childhood, he identifies with Flavia's 11-year-old zeal, remembering the [...] "feeling of being absolutely unstoppable," [...] capable of anything. He explains, [...] "when you're that age, you sometimes have a great burning enthusiasm that is very deep and very narrow, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> has always intrigued me - that world of the 11-year-old that is so quickly lost."

2500|$|The Washington Post {{film critic}} Stephen Hunter, a {{historian}} of the era, said: [...] "Any image of the American Revolution which represents you Brits as Nazis and us as gentle folk is almost certainly wrong. It was a very bitter war, a total war, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> I am afraid has been lost to history....he presence of the Loyalists (colonists {{who did not want}} to join the fight for independence from Britain) meant that the War of Independence was a conflict of complex loyalties." [...] The historian Richard F. Snow, editor of American Heritage magazine, said of the church-burning scene: [...] "Of course it never happened—if it had do you think Americans would have forgotten it? It could have kept us out of World War I." ...|$|E
2500|$|The milieu is {{identified}} by the author as science fantasy. As L'Engle explains in her book The Rock That Is Higher: Story as Truth: [...] "If we limit ourselves to the possible and provable... we render ourselves incapable of change and growth, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> should never end. If we limit ourselves to the age that we are, and forget all the ages that we have been, we diminish our truth." [...] Later in the same book, she further explains her use of the science fantasy genre: [...] "Writing A Wrinkle in Time... was my first effort in a genre now called 'science fantasy', and science fantasy is not far from fairy tale, that world which delves deep into the human psyche, struggling to find out {{at least a little}} more of what we are all about." ...|$|E

He sees the human and natural resources of the state meeting all the conditions to serve as the vanguard of a new model of development for Brazil. Speaking to News Rondônia he said, [...] "Rondônia is a state formed by a multitude of small and medium entrepreneurs together with the Brazilian government, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> truly unique in our country." ...|$|R

But whatever remains for further discussion and development, no-one can be in any doubt of the towering, and continuing, achievements of the man who began this model and has sustained it through nearly sixty years: Michael Halliday. To him, all of us who have worked within or alongside this framework owe a very substantial debt; <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> which I personally find pleasure in acknowledging with gratitude.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are many}} {{perceptions}} on who Mohamed Bouazizi was. After his self-immolation, Bouazizi’s image flooded social media {{which lead to}} worldwide discourse. This complicated how Bouazizi was seen, [...] "Mohamed Bouazizi is not our hero. He's your hero," [...] said local Tunisian Arabic Nader Ncibi. There are accusations that social media diluted what Bouazizi stood for. Naafil Harshani, an activist that grew up with Bouazizi, said, [...] "what was important to Mohamed was putting {{food on the table}} and football. He {{had nothing to do with}} politics and wanted nothing to do with politics." [...] Mohamed Bouazizi did not plan to start a revolution, but it is undeniable that it preceded his anger towards not being able to sell his fruit. [...] "There are many stories on who Mohamed was and who Mohamed wasn't," [...] said Zahra Shwabli, a Hay Al Noor primary school teacher, [...] "It is important for us on this day to remember what Mohamed Bouazizi stood for: the dignity of all Tunisians. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> not even time can take away from us." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the {{previous}} race in Italy, {{the gap between}} Rosberg and Hamilton had closed by seven points. Hamilton had started from pole position ahead of Rosberg, but had a poor start off the line and fell to fourth. He retook the lead after Rosberg braked late and went straight on at the first turn and used the escape road to rejoin the track. Hamilton remained the lead {{for the rest of}} the race to win. With six races left in the season, Hamilton was aware he could not lose any further ground to Rosberg in the championship battle and was pleased to make an improvement after his Monza victory: [...] "Despite the highs and lows, I'm still well and truly in the hunt for the championship <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> gives me huge motivation for the final six races - starting in Singapore." [...] Rosberg admitted Hamilton's form and past experience in championship battles could possibly be advantageous but it was something the latter was not concerned over and would focus on himself: [...] "At the moment, I am enjoying the moment more than I ever have in the sport because I get to a race and I have a car where I know I can be on pole and I can win," [...] Ricciardo stated that while he was aware his chances of winning the championship were not realistic, he would take a race-by-race approach, and hoped to win either of the season's next two races to draw closer in the title battle: [...] "All it takes is a couple of wins and a couple of bad races for the championship leader, and all of a sudden everything's possible again. So let's see what happens." ...|$|E

Sarda has a talent for defensive weapons design, which Starfleet keeps developing for offensive uses as well <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> which Vulcans considered immoral. Piper, in her ignorance, informed the Academy staff of Sardas talents, which led to his great personal embarrassment and being ostracized by other Vulcans in Starfleet. Piper and AndrusTaurus do some research on Vulcan and decide to consult with a Vulcan embassy that specialized in human-Vulcan relationships.|$|R

The codifiers have different attitudes towards this issue <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> I wonder about. I would like to find out why the data in grammars and dictionaries differ from the language usage as well as who decide which language form belongs to standard and which not. Are the codifiers the only ones or is the process influenced also by anyone else? These questions suggest <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> necessary to handle the theory of standard at first and then to analyse concrete examples...|$|R

[...] In a similar vein, Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, Lise Meitner's former assistant, later added that Hahn [...] "certainly did deserve this Nobel Prize. He would have deserved it even if he had not made this discovery. But everyone recognized that the splitting of the atomic nucleus merited a Nobel Prize." [...] Frisch wrote similarly in a 1955 letter.|$|R

5000|$|In {{an online}} review in The Quietus, Luke Slater wrote: Perhaps the least {{surprising}} thing about their thirteenth album {{is the lack}} of surprises. Urge For Offal does not represent a new or even vaguely modified HMHB. Nor are there any unexpected turns or diversions of musical style. ... Musically, things continue where 2011's 90 Bisodol (Crimond) left us. It is fundamentally rocky and occasionally loud, with prominent bass aplenty. There are almost all of the elements you would expect to find in a HMHB album. Various football references, the odd improbably surreal yarn, and some mentions of cycling, too. ... Though Urge For Offal may feel a bit like Half Man Half Biscuit by-numbers, it acts as a reminder of what they represent. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> be celebrated, albeit quietly.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{publication}} of the final volume of The Balkan Trilogy in 1965, Manning worked on her cat memoir and a collection of short stories, A Romantic Hero and Other Stories, both of which were published in 1967. Another novel, The Play Room (published as The Camperlea Girls in the US), appeared in 1969. The book of short stories and The Play Room both contained homosexual themes, a topic which interested Manning. The latter was a less than successful exploration of the lives and interests of adolescents, though the reviews were generally encouraging. A film version was proposed, and Ken Annakin asked her to write the script. The movie, with more explicit lesbian scenes than the book, was all but made before the money ran out; a second version, with a very different script, was also developed but came to nothing. [...] "Everything fizzled out", she said. [...] "I wasted a lot of time <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> which you cannot afford to do when you are sixty"; in keeping with her obfuscations about her age, she was actually sixty-two.|$|R

Wecht stated Daniel Smith {{died as a result}} of the interaction of methadone, an analgesic, and the antidepressants Zoloft and Lexapro. The metabolism and the breakdown of the methadone is delayed in the presence of Zoloft, according to Wecht. Methadone can alter the cardiac rhythm - it’s referred to as a prolongation of the QT interval. [...] "When that is prolonged, the individual could even lose consciousness, and suffer cardiac dysrhythmia. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> can happen from methadone alone, and in the presence of Zoloft and Lexapro, it is more likely to happen," [...] "I don’t mean frequently, and certainly not predictably, so tragically, with this young man this is what happened.

Stoudemire was named an assistant coach of the Canadian basketball team for the 2013 Maccabiah Games, giving him an opportunity to return to Israel.

Her graceful statuesque beauty was almost a symbol of God’s artistry",said actor Kaduvakulam Antony.
