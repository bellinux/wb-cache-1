40|$|Temporal {{coherence}} (i. e., {{the degree}} of synchronicity of a given variable among ecological units within a predefined space) has been shown for several limnological features among temperate lakes, allowing predictions about the structure and function of ecosystems. However, {{there is little evidence}} of temporal coherence among tropical aquatic systems, where the climatic variability among seasons is less pronounced. Here, we used data from long-term monitoring of physical, chemical and biological variables to test {{the degree of}} temporal coherence among 18 tropical coastal lagoons. The water temperature and chlorophyll-a concentration had the highest and lowest temporal coherence among the lagoons, respectively, whereas the salinity and water colour had intermediate temporal coherence. The regional climactic factors were the main factors responsible for the coherence patterns in the water temperature and water colour, whereas the landscape position and morphometric characteristics explained much of the variation of the salinity and water colour among the lagoons. These results indicate that both local (lagoon morphometry) and regional (precipitation, <b>air</b> <b>temperature)</b> <b>factors</b> regulate the physical and chemical conditions of coastal lagoons by adjusting the terrestrial and marine subsidies at a landscape-scale. On the other hand, the chlorophyll-a concentration appears to be primarily regulated by specific local conditions resulting in a weak temporal coherence among the ecosystems. We concluded that temporal coherence in tropical ecosystems is possible, at least for some environmental features, and should be evaluated for other tropical ecosystems. Our results also reinforce that aquatic ecosystems should be studied more broadly to accomplish a full understanding of their structure and function...|$|R

Time series {{over a period of}} 30 years (1979 - 2008) of climatic data of <b>air</b> <b>temperature,</b> relative humidity, soil temperature, volumetric soil water content, wind speed, and precipitation representing average climate were obtained utilising the ECMWF’s (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) system allowing for a homogeneous set of data in time and space. We analysed data of reported human cases of WNF/WNND and Culex mosquitoes in Northern Greece. Quantitative assessment resulted in identifying associations between the above climatic variables and reported human cases of WNF/WNND. A substantial fraction of the cases was linked to the upper percentiles of the distribution of <b>air</b> and soil <b>temperature</b> for the period 1979 - 2008 and the lower percentiles of relative humidity and soil water content. A statistically relevant relationship between the mean weekly value climatic anomalies of wind speed (negative association), relative humidity (negative association) and <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> (positive association) over 30 years, and reported human cases of WNF/WNND during the period 2010 - 2014 could be shown.

The findings confirm that there is a strong relationship between microclimatic conditions and use of open spaces. Regarding the users of open spaces, a sensitivity to the summer heat was apparent for the age category > 65. The spatial distribution of the interviewees demonstrates that in summer, visitors prefer to sit in shaded areas, whereas in autumn and winter sunlit areas are more popular. Observations of the use of space revealed that <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> and solar radiation were found to be the most dominant parameters in relation to the use of space, with wind speed and relative humidity having a weak effect. In general, people prefer shaded areas at higher <b>air</b> <b>temperatures.</b> However, as high <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> is a <b>factor</b> contributing to discomfort, overall presence is reduced when <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> rises significantly.

The relationship of the daily maximum hourly ozone values with meteorological variables, including near surface <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> and relative humidity and with air pollution variables like the persistency of ozone levels and its seasonal variation is examined.

One of the best methods for producing high resolution, low error, quantitative summer <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> reconstructions is through chironomid analyses. We analysed over 50 lakes from NW and W Iceland covering a range of environmental gradients {{in order to test}} whether the distribution of the Icelandic chironomid fauna was driven by summer temperature, or whether other environmental factors were more dominant. A range of analyses showed the main environmental controls on chironomid communities to be substrate (identified through loss-on-ignition and carbon content) and mean July <b>air</b> <b>temperature,</b> although other <b>factors</b> such as lake depth and lake area were also important. The nature of the Icelandic landscape, with numerous volcanic centres (many of which are covered by ice caps) that produce large quantities of ash, means that relative lake carbon content and summer <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> do not co-vary, as they often do in other chironomid datasets within the Arctic as well as more temperate environments. As the chironomid-environment relationships are thus different in Iceland compared to other chironomid training sets, we suggest that using an Icelandic model is most appropriate for reconstructing past environmental change from fossil Icelandic datasets. Analogue matching of Icelandic fossil chironomid datasets with the Icelandic training set and another European chironomid training set support this assertion. Analyses of a range of chironomid-inferred temperature transfer functions suggest the best to be a two component WA-PLS model with r 2 jack = 0. 66 and RMSEP = 1. 095 °C.

The {{results indicate that the}} interdiurnal <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> drops vary in each temperature characteristics. While daily maximum <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> exhibit the greatest rates of decrease in summer months (July - August), the greatest drops of daily minimum <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> occur exclusively in December and January. Significant abnormality was ascertained during abrupt cooling {{at the turn of the}} years 1978 and 1979, when abrupt temperature drop was detect in both maximum and minimum <b>air</b> <b>temperature.</b> The seasonality of interdiurnal mean <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> drops exhibit changes of both daily maximum and minimum <b>air</b> <b>temperature.</b> In thesis is also discussed the unsuitability of specification of intrdiurnal air tepmerature changes based on daily mean <b>air</b> <b>temperature.</b> Key words: temperature drop, cold front, radiation cooling, interdiurnal chang...|$|R

In this paper we demonstrate a statistical analysis approach to facilitate the interpretation and application of these datasets to achieve monitoring objectives.

30|$|<b>Air</b> <b>temperature</b> at {{the inlet}} of EATHE pipe plays a {{significant}} role, because {{the rate of}} heat transfer between air and soil is governed by the <b>temperature</b> difference between <b>air</b> and ground. Kumar et al. (2006) studied the impact of ambient <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> on outlet <b>air</b> <b>temperature.</b> It was noticed that, with the increase in inlet <b>air</b> <b>temperature,</b> the outlet <b>temperature</b> of <b>air</b> also increases, but the amplitude decreases significantly. When the inlet temperature varied from 27 to 45.9  °C, outlet <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> varied from 23.8 to 27.9  °C for an 80  m-long earth air tunnel. Elminshawy et al. (2017) used a small laboratory scale EAPHE experimental set-up under controlled conditions of operating parameters such as soil bulk <b>temperature,</b> <b>air</b> flow rate, and induced <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> at three different compaction levels. It was noticed that, for a particular compaction level (at highest density), the cooling capacity of EAPHE system increases by 227 % when the induced <b>air</b> inlet <b>temperature</b> is increased from 40 to 55  °C. Niu et al. (2015) established a 1 -D steady-state control volume model and observed the impact of inlet <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> on the performance of EAHE. It was found that, when the inlet <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> was high, the decline rate of <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> in EAHE pipe was higher. For the inlet <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> of 34, 32, 30, 28, and 26  °C, the highest and lowest decline rate of <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> was found for 34 and 26  °C, respectively.|$|R
