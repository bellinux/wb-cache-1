The Islam that was preached 2,000 years ago isn’t going to work here in modern London. Muslims need to alter their lifestyles to a Western lifestyle. To criticise is not Islamaphobic. It's about opposing certain ideas.|$|E
500|$|Shore {{traced the}} concept {{for the title}} {{character}} to {{his experience as a}} patient at a teaching hospital. Shore recalled: [...] "I knew, as soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> the room, they would be mocking me relentlessly [...] and I thought that {{it would be interesting to}} see a character who actually did that before they left the room." [...] A central part of the show's premise was that the main character would be disabled in some way. The original idea was for House to use a wheelchair, but Fox rejected this. Jacobs later expressed her gratitude for the network's insistence that the character be reimagined—putting him on his feet added a crucial physical dimension. The writers ultimately chose to give House a damaged leg arising from an incorrect diagnosis, which requires him to use a cane and causes him pain that leads to a narcotic dependency.|$|E
500|$|Series creator David Shore {{traced the}} concept for House to his {{background}} as a patient at a teaching hospital. Shore recalled that [...] "I knew, as soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> the room, they would be mocking me relentlessly [...] and I {{thought that it would}} be interesting to see a character who actually did that before they left the room." [...] In 2004, Shore and executive producers Katie Jacobs and Paul Attanasio pitched House to Fox as a medical detective showa hospital whodunit where the doctors would be the sleuths looking for the source of symptoms. The ideas behind House's character were added after Fox bought the show. Shore wrote the pilot with a vivid memory of a doctor's visit: he once had to wait two weeks to get a doctor's appointment for a sore hip, by which point his pain had disappeared. Nevertheless, Shore stated that the doctors were [...] "incredibly polite". Shore later stated that, as he wrote the pilot, he fell in love with a character who, as a doctor, would actually ask the question [...] "Why am I wasting your time?".|$|E

2500|$|After he left office, Clifford, in the July 1969 {{issue of}} Foreign Affairs, made his views very clear: [...] "Nothing {{we might do}} could be so beneficial... as to begin to {{withdraw}} our combat troops. Moreover... we cannot realistically expect to achieve anything more through our military force, and {{the time has come}} to begin to disengage. That was my final conclusion <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> the Pentagon..." [...] Clifford received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, with Distinction, from Johnson on the President's last day in office, January 20, 1969.|$|E

As soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was out of the servant's sight, I turned back to the side of the building, and ventured <b>as</b> near <b>as</b> <b>I</b> durst to the window of the sitting-room. Their voices reached me, but not their words. On both sides, the tones were low and confidential. Not a note of anger in either voice--listen for it <b>as</b> <b>I</b> might! <b>I</b> <b>left</b> the house again, breathless with amazement, and (so rapidly does a woman shift from one emotion to another) burning with curiosity.|$|R

2500|$|When Narayanan {{returned}} to India in 1948, Laski {{gave him a}} letter of introduction to Prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Years later, he narrated how {{he began his career}} in the public service:When I finished with LSE, Laski, of his own, gave me a letter of introduction for Panditji. On reaching Delhi I sought an appointment with the PM. I suppose, because I was an Indian student returning home from London, I was given a time-slot. It was here in Parliament House that he met me. We talked for a few minutes about London and things like that and I could soon see {{that it was time for}} me to leave. So I said goodbye and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> the room I handed over the letter from Laski, and stepped out into the great circular corridor outside. When I was half way round, I heard the sound of someone clapping from the direction I had just come. I turned to see Panditji [...] beckoning me to come back. He had opened the letter <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> his room and read it. [...] "Why didn't you give this to me earlier?" [...] "Well, sir, I am sorry. I thought it would be enough if I just handed it over while leaving." [...] After a few more questions, he asked me to see him again and very soon I found myself entering the Indian Foreign Service.|$|E
2500|$|Much of Lowry's {{early years}} were {{spent in the}} leafy Manchester suburb of Victoria Park, Rusholme, but in 1909, when he was 22, due to {{financial}} pressures, {{the family moved to}} 117 Station Road in the industrial town of Pendlebury. Here the landscape comprised textile mills and factory chimneys rather than trees. Lowry later recalled: [...] "At first I detested it, and then, after years I got pretty interested in it, then obsessed by it... One day I missed a train from Pendlebury – [...] I had ignored for seven years– and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> the station I saw the Acme Spinning Company's mill... The huge black framework of rows of yellow-lit windows standing up against the sad, damp charged afternoon sky. The mill was turning out... I watched this scene— which I'd looked at many times without seeing— with rapture..." ...|$|E

60|$|No: stillness returned: each murmur and {{movement}} ceased gradually, and {{in about an}} hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed as a desert.
