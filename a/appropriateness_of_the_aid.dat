40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{is limited}} {{evidence}} indicating that laypersons trained in first aid provide better help, {{but do not}} help more often than untrained laypersons. This study investigated the effect of conventional first aid training versus conventional training plus supplementary training aimed at decreasing barriers to helping. METHODS: The authors conducted a randomised controlled trial. After 24 h of conventional first aid training, the participants either attended an experimental lesson to reduce barriers to helping or followed a control lesson. The authors used a deception test to measure the time between {{the start of the}} unannounced simulated emergency and seeking help behaviour and the number of particular helping actions. RESULTS: The authors randomised 72 participants to both groups. 22 participants were included in the analysis for the experimental group and 36 in the control group. The authors found no statistically or clinically significant differences for any of the outcome measures. The time until seeking help (geometrical mean and 95 % CI) was 55. 5 s (42. 9 to 72. 0) in the experimental group and 56. 5 s (43. 0 to 74. 3) in the control group. 57 % of the participants asked a bystander to seek help, 40 % left the victim to seek help themselves and 3 % did not seek any help. CONCLUSION: Supplementary training on dealing with barriers to helping did not alter the helping behaviour. The timing and <b>appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> provided can be improved.

40|$|IntroductionIn {{order to}} improve the quality of care, {{evidence-based}} practice seeks to bridge the gap between evidence and practice. While cardiopulmonary resuscitation by laypeople was extensively studied and evidence-based guidelines were published, the field of non-resuscitative first aid lagged behind in applying evidence-based practice. Taking into account the considerable burden of injury, the life-saving potential of first aid, the potential benefits of evidence-based practice, areas of controversy in first aid, and the gaps in systematic analysis of first aid evidence, it was the purpose of this thesis to introduce evidence-based practice in the first aid training activities of the Belgian Red Cross-Flanders and to add new empirical data to the research base. MethodsTo realise this objective we first produced an evidence-based guideline to determine the most effective, safe, and feasible first aid techniques and procedures, and to formulate recommendations for training. Next we performed a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of first aid training. This systematic review also led us to the design of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate if training on barriers to helping facilitates emergency helping behaviour among laypersons trained in first aid. We evaluated this by means of a deception test in which the participants were unaware that an emergency was simulated and did not know that their helping behaviour was being evaluated. Having the confidence to provide first aid may influence helping barriers. Therefore this RCT also measured the participants self-efficacy beliefs and related these to the performance demonstrated in the deception. The pressing need for information, especially in emergency care settings, has given rise to the methodology of rapid reviews in which methods for the search, appraisal, synthesis and analysis are determined by time constraints. We conducted two such rapid reviews for very specific clinical questions. Because there is limited evidence regarding the validity of rapid reviews, we compared the results of one of our rapid reviews with a systematic review on the same topic. Finally, we tried to add to the research in the quality of evidence-based guidelines by evaluating the content and rigour of development of recommendations on the use of ice in guidelines for acute ankle sprains. ResultsWith a multidisciplinary panel of European experts that considered the findings from the available evidence, we produced European guidelines on safety measures, emergency removal of victims, psychosocial first aid and first aid for trauma and oral poisoning. Our systematic review found two studies that succeeded in measuring the change in helping behaviour after first aid training. Based on these studies we tentatively concluded that conventional first aid training improved competences but not performance. Supplementary training on dealing with barriers to helping might increase helping rates. In our RCT we found that such supplementary training did not alter the time or rate of helping in an acute myocardial infarction emergency. The good news was that all the participants demonstrated some type of helping reaction and nearly all the participants sought help. Despite the very high helping rates, there is still a need to increase the timeliness and <b>appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> provided. First aid self-efficacy beliefs were not correlated with performance. The comparison between a rapid review and a systematic review on the same topic demonstrated differences in the selected evidence and conclusions. From the manuscript of the systematic review it was not possible to evaluate the reasons for these differences. In a published letter to the editor we drew attention to adherence to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, i. e. the PRISMA statement. The evaluation of guidelines on ice for ankle sprains found methodological problems among the included guidelines and shortcomings of the AGREE instrument to identify them. The 21 guidelines included in the analysis, contained clinically significant variations in their recommendations. The variation was not related to the quality of the guideline. DiscussionThe main achievement of this thesis is that we introduced evidence-based practice to the practice-oriented domain of first aid training and to the Belgian Red Cross-Flanders. In 2009, the Belgian Red Cross-Flanders founded the Expertise Centre which reviews evidence in all the areas where the organisation is active. Furthermore, the evidence-based principle became the central principle in the strategic plan Pledge 2015  of the Belgian Red Cross-Flanders. The number of recommendations in the European first aid guidelines for which no strong evidence was available, the amount of relevant but biased studies in the systematic review, and the findings from the methodological research on guidelines for ice and ankle sprains illustrated that the evidence in first aid was sometimes disastrous. However, when available we turned evidence into practice. In our community-based trial we made diverging observations versus previous trials regarding the effect of supplementary training on dealing with barriers to helping and regarding the rate of helping behaviour. The high loss to follow-up was an important limitation of this study, making it difficult to derive conclusions. First aid self-efficacy beliefs did not appear to be a good predictor of performance. Deception tests showed to be a useful way to gather information on the helping behaviour of laypeople trained in first aid. Our comparison of guidelines on ankle sprains illustrated that many guidelines suffer from methodological shortcomings. To evaluate the validity of guidelines, we suggest an analysis of the content of the recommendations in addition to an AGREE evaluation. We recommend caution in viewing guidelines themselves as a form of evidence and we made suggestions {{to improve the quality}} of evidence-based guidelines. Further research is needed to address the question about the validity of rapid reviews and a concept to evaluate this has been presented. We believe that this thesis made a significant contribution to the field of evidence-based first aid and has created the enthusiasm to start new evidence-based projects in first aid and beyond in the area of humanitarian aid.

Methods: P 3 P was translated to Spanish and back-translated by three native Spanish-speaking translators working independently. Spanish-speaking Latino men with a diagnosis of localized prostate cancer, who had made treatment decisions in the past 24 months, were recruited from two urban clinical care sites. Individual cognitive interviews were conducted by two bilingual research assistants as each participant used the Spanish P 3 P. Notes of user behavior, feedback, and answers to direct questions about comprehension, usability and perceived usefulness were analyzed and categorized. Results: Seven participants with a range of education levels identified 25 unique usability issues in navigation, content comprehension and completeness, sociocultural appropriateness, and methodology. Revisions were prioritized to refine the usability and cultural and linguistic <b>appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decision <b>aid.</b> Conclusions: Usability issues were discovered that are potential barriers to effective decision support.

Materials and Methods : This prospective study included children with aged range 0 - 12 years, who presented with an unintentional injury at <b>the</b> Trauma Unit <b>of</b> a hospital in Cape Town, South Africa, over a 3 month period. Caregivers were interviewed about <b>the</b> circumstances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> injury and <b>the</b> first <b>aid</b> provided. Experts classified <b>the</b> first <b>aid</b> as appropriate, appropriate but incomplete, or inappropriate. Results: A total of 313 children were included with a median age of 3. 75 years. The most common causes of injury were falls (39. 6 %, n = 124), burns (23. 9 %, n = 75) and motor vehicle crashes (10. 5 %, n = 33). More than a quarter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> children (27. 2 %, n = 81) had been left under <b>the</b> supervision <b>of</b> another child below <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> 12. When <b>the</b> injury occurred, 7. 1 % (n = 22) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> children were unattended. First aid was provided in 43. 1 % (n = 134) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cases. More than half of these interventions (53 %, n = 72) were inappropriate or appropriate but incomplete. Conclusions: Especially young children are at risk for unintentional injuries. Lack of appropriate supervision increases this risk. Prevention education of parents and children may help to protect children from injuries.

Because mobile advertisements are not controlled by <b>the</b> content rating <b>of</b> apps, unexpected objectionable contents may occur and be harmful to children’s mental health. This study {{is the first to}} explore <b>the</b> content <b>appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> in-app advertisements on mobile devices from children’s online safety perspective. We find in-app advertisements are common in the free apps designed for children on smart platforms. Experimental results show that a large percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> in-app advertisements carry inappropriate contents for children.
