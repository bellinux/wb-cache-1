5|$|As {{early as}} 1914, the British Admiral Percy Scott {{predicted}} that battleships {{would soon be}} made irrelevant by aircraft. By the end of World War I, aircraft had successfully adopted the torpedo as <b>a</b> <b>weapon.</b> <b>In</b> 1921 the Italian general and air theorist Giulio Douhet completed a hugely influential treatise on strategic bombing titled The Command of the Air, which foresaw the dominance of air power over naval units.|$|E
5|$|At Liverpool the Medicine and Science faculties worked {{together}} closely. Chadwick was automatically a committee member of both faculties, and in 1938 {{he was appointed}} to a commission headed by Lord Derby to investigate the arrangements for cancer treatment in Liverpool. Chadwick anticipated that neutrons and radioactive isotopes produced with the 37-inch cyclotron {{could be used to}} study biochemical processes, and might become <b>a</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> the fight against cancer.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins in}} Pohang, South Korea, where Navy SEAL {{commander}} Steve McGarrett (Alex O'Loughlin) is transporting prisoner Anton Hesse (Norman Reedus). Anton's brother, Victor (James Marsters) calls McGarrett to announce {{he is holding}} his father, John McGarrett (William Sadler), in Honolulu, and wants to make an exchange. However, Victor is in fact tracking McGarrett's convoy; two helicopters arrive and ambush it. In {{the midst of the}} skirmish, McGarrett is forced to kill Anton when he brandishes <b>a</b> <b>weapon.</b> <b>In</b> response, Victor executes John.|$|E

50|$|Research {{into the}} {{development}} of nuclear weapons was undertaken during World War II by the United States (in cooperation with the United Kingdom and Canada), Germany, Japan, and the USSR. The United States {{was the first and}} is the only country to have used <b>a</b> nuclear <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> war, when it used two bombs against Japan in August 1945. With their loss during the war, Germany and Japan ceased to be involved <b>in</b> any nuclear <b>weapon</b> research. <b>In</b> August 1949, the USSR tested <b>a</b> nuclear <b>weapon.</b> The United Kingdom tested <b>a</b> nuclear <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> October 1952. France developed <b>a</b> nuclear <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> 1960. The People's Republic of China detonated <b>a</b> nuclear <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> 1964. India exploded a nuclear device in 1974, and Pakistan conducted a series of nuclear <b>weapon</b> tests <b>in</b> May 1998, following tests by India earlier that month. In 2006, North Korea conducted its first nuclear test.|$|R
5|$|The {{fact that}} a person prepares <b>a</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> order to defend {{themselves}} against expected attack does not preclude the defense from being legitimate and, according to courts, {{it may not be}} expected from a defender to wait and rely on chance that a damage which is, both objectively and in the defender's subjective understanding, threatened to happen, will not take place. The defender may use proportionate accessible means in order to prevent an imminent attack and disarm the attacker.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, new {{government}} turned toward Soviet influence and the Stalinist monumentalism. The doctrine of Socialist realism in Poland, {{as in other}} countries of the People's Republics, was enforced from 1949 to 1956. It involved all domains of art, but its most spectacular achievements {{were made in the}} field of urban design. The guidelines for this new trend were spelled-out in a 1949 resolution of the National Council of Party Architects. Architecture was to become <b>a</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> establishing the new social order by the communists. The ideological impact of urban design was valued more than aesthetics. It aimed at expressing persistence and power. This form of architecture was implemented in the new industrial district of Nowa Huta with apartment blocks constructed according to a Stalinist blueprint, with repetitious courtyards and wide, tree-lined avenues.|$|E
5|$|There {{appear to}} be no extant records of the {{meetings}} which elected Arsenal to the First Division in 1919, however the book Making the Arsenal proposes a different reason for their election in that year. The site argues that the match fixing issues of {{the final year of}} football before the war (1914–15) were used by Norris as <b>a</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> his battle to get Arsenal promoted. He demanded that Liverpool and Manchester United (some of who's players had been found guilty of match fixing) be punished by relegation or expulsion, and threatened to organise a breakaway from the league by Midlands and southern clubs if nothing was done. To placate him the League offered Arsenal a place in the First Division.|$|E

5|$|Chlorine gas, {{also known}} as bertholite, was first used as <b>a</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> World War I by Germany on April 22, 1915 in the Second Battle of Ypres. As {{described}} by the soldiers, it had the distinctive smell of a mixture of pepper and pineapple. It also tasted metallic and stung {{the back of the}} throat and chest. Chlorine reacts with water in the mucosa of the lungs to form hydrochloric acid, destructive to living tissue and potentially lethal. Human respiratory systems can be protected from chlorine gas by gas masks with activated charcoal or other filters, which makes chlorine gas much less lethal than other chemical weapons. It was pioneered by a German scientist later to be a Nobel laureate, Fritz Haber of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, in collaboration with the German chemical conglomerate IG Farben, which developed methods for discharging chlorine gas against an entrenched enemy. After its first use, both sides in the conflict used chlorine as a chemical weapon, but it was soon replaced by the more deadly phosgene and mustard gas.|$|E
5|$|Liebknecht and Bernstein, {{like the}} left wing of the party, felt the general strike {{should not be used}} to provoke the state but rather to defend {{political}} rights (especially the right to vote) should the state seek to abolish them. The more conservative faction in the party was opposed to this concept. In 1904, Friedeberg, speaking for the FVdG, advanced the view that the general strike must be <b>a</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> the hands of the proletariat and would be the last step before the socialist revolution. In 1905, his speech on the topic was even more radical. He claimed that historical materialism, a pillar of Marxism, was to blame for social democracy's alleged powerlessness, and introduced the alternative concept of historical psychism—which held that human psychology was more significant for social development than material conditions. He also recommended the anarchist literature especially Kropotkin's writings rather than Marx's works, which were most influential in the SPD.|$|E

25|$|A Marshal's duties {{consisted}} {{in providing}} {{security to the}} King and keeping order where he was present. Marshals commanded two regiments of infantry, a regiment of militia, and a special court of law with a marshal's judge (sędzia marszałkowski), marshal's clerk (pisarz marszałkowski) and assessors (singular: asesor). These courts passed sentence on the spot, without possibility of appeal. For crimes such as drawing <b>a</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> the King's presence, the penalty was death. A Marshal's court had jurisdiction over all crimes committed against the royal court and by courtiers.|$|E
