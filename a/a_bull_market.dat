25|$|When {{stocks are}} rising (<b>a</b> <b>bull</b> <b>market),</b> {{the belief that}} further rises are {{probable}} gives investors an incentive to buy (positive feedback—reinforcing the rise, see also stock market bubble and momentum investing); but the increased price of the shares, and the knowledge {{that there must be}} a peak after which the market falls, ends up deterring buyers (negative feedback—stabilizing the rise).|$|E
25|$|Corporate {{transactional}} events generally {{fit into}} three categories: distressed securities, risk arbitrage, and special situations. Distressed securities include such events as restructurings, recapitalizations, and bankruptcies. A distressed securities investment strategy involves {{investing in the}} bonds or loans of companies facing bankruptcy or severe financial distress, when these bonds or loans are being traded at a discount to their value. Hedge fund managers pursuing the distressed debt investment strategy aim to capitalize on depressed bond prices. Hedge funds purchasing distressed debt may prevent those companies from going bankrupt, as such an acquisition deters foreclosure by banks. While event-driven investing in general tends to thrive during <b>a</b> <b>bull</b> <b>market,</b> distressed investing works best during a bear market.|$|E
25|$|A {{private equity}} fund say for example, ABC Capital II, borrows $9bn from a bank (or other lender). To this it adds $2bn of equity – money from its own {{partners}} and from limited partners (pension funds, rich individuals, etc.). With this $11bn it buys all the shares of an underperforming company, XYZ Industrial (after due diligence, i.e. checking the books). It replaces the senior management in XYZ Industrial, and {{they set out to}} streamline it. The workforce is reduced, some assets are sold off, etc. The objective is to increase the value of the company for an early sale. The stock market is experiencing <b>a</b> <b>bull</b> <b>market,</b> and XYZ Industrial is sold two years after the buy-out for $13bn, yielding a profit of $2bn. The original loan can now be paid off with interest of say $0.5bn. The remaining profit of $1.5bn is shared among the partners. Taxation of such gains is at capital gains rates. Note that part of that profit results from turning the company around, and part results from the general increase in share prices in a buoyant stock market, the latter often being the greater component.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>a</b> secular <b>bull</b> <b>market</b> the {{prevailing}} trend is [...] "bullish" [...] or upward-moving. The United States stock market {{was described as}} being in <b>a</b> secular <b>bull</b> <b>market</b> from about 1983 to 2000 (or 2007), with brief upsets including the crash of 1987 and the market collapse of 2000-2002 triggered by the dot-com bubble.|$|R

50|$|A secular {{market trend}} is a {{long-term}} trend that lasts 5 to 25 years and consists {{of a series of}} primary trends. A secular bear market consists of smaller <b>bull</b> <b>markets</b> and larger bear markets; <b>a</b> secular <b>bull</b> <b>market</b> consists of larger <b>bull</b> <b>markets</b> and smaller bear markets.|$|R
50|$|U.S. {{government}} bonds did well, especially longer terms. Yields dropped {{during this time}} period, part of <b>a</b> long-term <b>bull</b> <b>market.</b> High-grade corporate bonds and muni bonds also performed well. However, high-yield bonds had very bad performance, although they turned up coincident with the <b>bull</b> <b>market</b> in stocks.|$|R
2500|$|An {{issue with}} buying shares {{in a bear}} market is that despite {{appearing}} undervalued at one time, prices can still drop along with the market.

2500|$|The McMahons' {{suit was}} one of a rising number filed against brokers by disgruntled investors during <b>a</b> <b>bull</b> <b>market.</b> Many brokers felt, as McNulty and Shearson did about the McMahons, that clients {{expected}} ever-increasing returns and did not understand that these were just ordinary, unavoidable market losses. [...] "The brokerage relationship is not a guarantee relationship or an insurance relationship," [...] said Edward O'Brien, president of the Securities Industry Association. [...] "You're not supposed to simply turn things over to someone else." [...] They wanted arbitration clauses to be enforced so that they would spend less time and money defending lawsuits.|$|E
2500|$|In 1884 Charles H. Dow began {{tracking}} stocks, initially {{beginning with}} 11 stocks, mostly railroads, {{and looked at}} average prices for these eleven. When the average [...] "peaks and troughs" [...] went up consistently, he deemed it <b>a</b> <b>bull</b> <b>market</b> condition; if averages dropped, it was a bear market. He added up prices, and divided {{by the number of}} stocks to get his Dow Jones average. Dow's numbers were a [...] "convenient benchmark" [...] for analyzing the market and became an accepted way to look at the entire stock market. In 1889 the original stock report, Customers' Afternoon Letter, became The Wall Street Journal. Named in reference to the actual street, it became an influential international daily business newspaper published in New York City. After October 7, 1896, it began publishing Dow's expanded list of stocks. A century later, there were 30 stocks in the average.|$|E

50|$|A {{slightly}} different {{version of the}} indicator is still used by the Investors Chronicle, a British investment magazine. The main {{difference is that the}} Investors Chronicle version does include the sell signals, although it stresses that they are to be treated with caution.

50|$|Gold prices {{remained}} relatively low until 2001, {{when the price}} began consistently rising in <b>a</b> protracted <b>bull</b> <b>market.</b> By 2007, {{the price of gold}} had reached US$675, and the loss to the UK taxpayer (contrasted to selling the gold later) was estimated at more than £2 billion, as the Euros bought with the proceeds had also risen in value.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>bull</b> <b>market</b> is {{a period}} of {{generally}} rising prices. The start of <b>a</b> <b>bull</b> <b>market</b> is marked by widespread pessimism. This point is when the [...] "crowd" [...] is the most [...] "bearish". The feeling of despondency changes to hope, [...] "optimism", and eventually euphoria, as the bull runs its course. This often leads the economic cycle, for example in a full recession, or earlier.|$|E

5000|$|Financial {{analysts have}} {{different}} {{opinions on the}} bull-bear line. Some believed the 250-day moving average is not the [...] "bull-bear line". According to Dow Theory by Charles Dow, <b>an</b> American journalist, <b>bull</b> <b>market</b> and bear market are defined by investor's mindset. <b>Bull</b> <b>market</b> develops under extremely optimistic situations, while bear market develops under extremely pessimistic situations. There is no limitations on time duration for both markets.

5|$|Between 1999 and 2002 Brown sold 60% of the UK's gold {{reserves}} shortly before gold entered <b>a</b> protracted <b>bull</b> <b>market,</b> since nicknamed by dealers as Brown Bottom. The official reason for selling the {{gold reserves}} was {{to reduce the}} portfolio risk of the UK's reserves by diversifying away from gold. The UK eventually sold about 395 tons of gold over 17 auctions from July 1999 to March 2002, at an average price of about US$275 per ounce, raising approximately US$3.5billion. By 2011, that quantity of gold would be worth over $19 billion, leading to Brown's decision to sell the gold being widely criticised.|$|R
