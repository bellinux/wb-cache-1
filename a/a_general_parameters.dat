Fracture strain is not an engineering strain since distribution of the deformation is inhomogeneous within the reference length.

40|$|Size {{dependencies}} of {{the peak}} effect and irreversibility field in superconducting Sm- 123 powder specimens were investigated.

This shows that the peak effect does not originate directly from elementary pinning mechanisms, but from a cooperative phenomenon of flux lines, as proposed by the pinning-induced disorder transition model. In addition, when powder size is smaller than virtual pinning correlation length in the ideal creep-free case, irreversibility field decreases with powder size. This supports the hypothesis that longitudinal flux bundle size is given by this length, as predicted by flux creep theory. These findings indicate that pinning correlation length is <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>parameter</b> that determines various properties associated with flux pinning phenomena...|$|R
