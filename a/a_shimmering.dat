5|$|Hope shows {{its central}} {{character}} alone, {{with no other}} human figures visible and without her traditional fellow virtues, Love (also known as Charity) and Faith. She is dressed in classical costume, based on the Elgin Marbles; Nicholas Tromans of Kingston University speculated that her Greek style of clothing was intentionally chosen to evoke the ambivalent nature of hope in Greek mythology over the certainties of Christian tradition. Her pose is based on that of Michelangelo's Night, in an intentionally strained position. She sits on a small, imperfect orange globe with wisps of cloud around its circumference, against an almost blank mottled blue background. The figure is illuminated faintly from behind, as if by starlight, and also directly from the front as if the observer {{is the source of}} light. Watts's use of light and tone avoids the clear definition of shapes, creating <b>a</b> <b>shimmering</b> and dissolving effect more typically associated with pastel work than with oil painting.|$|E
25|$|The key subgenres of soul {{include the}} Detroit (Motown) style, a rhythmic music {{influenced}} by gospel; deep soul and southern soul, driving, energetic soul styles combining R with southern gospel music sounds; Memphis soul, <b>a</b> <b>shimmering,</b> sultry style; New Orleans soul, {{which came out}} of the rhythm and blues style; Chicago soul, a lighter gospel-influenced sound; Philadelphia soul, a lush orchestral sound with doo-wop-inspired vocals; Psychedelic soul, a blend of psychedelic rock and soul music; as well as categories such as Blue-eyed soul, which is soul music performed by white artists; British soul; and Northern soul, rare soul music played by DJs at nightclubs in Northern England.|$|E
25|$|Seurat uses {{a variety}} of means to suggest the baking heat of a summer’s day at the riverside. A hot haze softens {{the edges of the}} trees in the middle-distance and washes out colour from the bridges and {{factories}} in the background—the blue of the sky at the horizon is paled almost to whiteness. <b>A</b> <b>shimmering</b> appearance at the surface of Bathers at Asnières subtly reinforces this saturating heat and sunlight. Writing about these effects, the art historian Roger Fry reported his view that, “no one could render this enveloping with a more exquisitely tremulous sensibility, a more penetrating observation or more unfailing consistency, than Seurat”.|$|E

25|$|Coombe Cliff on Coombe Road was {{the home}} of the Horniman family of tea merchants. John Horniman (1803–1893) and Frederick John Horniman (1835–1906) are known as public benefactors and politicians. Frederick is remembered as the founder of the Horniman Museum. In 1850 John Horniman bought a piece of land known as The Warren and in 1853 he {{employed}} the Brown building firm to build a house on the site for him. Coombe Cliff had an important example of a Victorian conservatory with fine ironwork, used for Horniman's plant collection. Its glasswork created <b>a</b> <b>shimmering</b> effect in sunlight. Originally erected in 1894 as a 'lean-to' conservatory, and derelict by 1982, it was dismantled, refurbished and reconstructed as a free-standing conservatory adjacent to the Horniman Museum (in Forest Hill, London) in 1987, where it is in use for recitals, receptions etc.In 1930 Croydon Corporation purchased the house and gardens for a convalescent home for children, and it had several other uses before finally being used as an adult education centre in 1960. Coombe Cliff's gardens were merged into neighbouring Park Hill and opened to the public.|$|E
25|$|The queen was {{designed}} by Cameron in collaboration with special effects artist Stan Winston, based upon an initial painting Cameron had done {{at the start of}} the project. The Winston Studio created a test foam core queen before constructing the full hydraulic puppet which was used for most of the scenes involving the large Alien. Two people were inside working the twin sets of arms, and puppeteers off-screen worked its jaws and head. Although at the end of the film, the queen was presented full-body fighting the power-loader, the audience never sees the legs of the queen, save those of the small-scale puppet that appears only briefly. In Aliens, Cameron used very selective camera-angles on the queen, using the '' style of photography. Subsequently, the movie won an Oscar for Visual Effects. An adult queen was to reappear in Alien Resurrection. The original mechanical head previously used in Aliens was provided by Bob Burns and was an altered design. It was repainted with a blend of green and brown, giving it <b>a</b> <b>shimmering,</b> insect-like quality. This color concept would be abandoned in Alien vs. Predator in favour of the original black color scheme.|$|E

It {{should also be noted that}} his music is ideally written for the piano and is clearly the work of a master pianist.|$|E

Mikael Wood from Entertainment Weekly appreciated the cover, and opined that [...] " [...] discovers the beating heart inside that band's subdued electro-goth jam". Becky Bain from Idolator called Shakira's version of [...] "Islands" [...] "sunnier than the original" [...] and regarded it as [...] "brilliantly subdued", complimenting the singer's overall reworking of the original track.

Sitting at a piano center stage, she entranced with <b>a</b> <b>shimmering</b> melody and heartbreaking, hypnotic hook. Stripped of any pomp and circumstance, Lee's talents transfixed.

[...] Serene Dominic of The Arizona Republic wrote: [...] "The biggest shrieks came when the piano movers made their first appearance and wheeled a baby grand onstage for 'Lost in Paradise.'"

500|$|Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly graded {{the film}} with a 'B–' rating, {{summarizing}} it as a [...] "lulling, happy-face story of retirement-age self-renewal, set in <b>a</b> <b>shimmering,</b> weltering, jewel-colored India", {{and that it}} succeeded in selling [...] "something safe and sweet, in a vivid foreign setting, to an underserved share of the moviegoing market." [...] Peter Bradshaw, writing for The Guardian, was more igneous in his 2/5 star review, saying that the film [...] "needs a Stannah chairlift to get it up to any level of watchability, {{and it is not}} exactly concerned to do away with condescending stereotypes about old people, or Indian people of any age." [...] Noting the luminous, prolific resumes of the cast he noted [...] "nothing in this insipid story does anything like justice to the cast's combined potential." [...] He went on to opine that the film appeared [...] "oddly like an Agatha Christie thriller with all the pasteboard characters, 2D backstories and foreign locale, but no murder." [...] In further negative reviews, critics from The Guardian and the blog Marshall and the Movies criticized the film for having a colonialist and orientalist point of view towards India.|$|E
500|$|An {{appraisal}} in {{the book}} Singles dubs the song [...] "a simple but elegant recording now judged {{by many to be}} one of the finest examples of what would become doo-wop". Despite the higher success of the cover by the Crew-Cuts, the original amateur recording by the Penguins is now considered definitive. Steve Sullivan, author of the Encyclopedia of Great Popular Song Recordings, writes that the track [...] "possesses virtually all of the qualities cherished by doo-wop lovers: melodic beauty, <b>a</b> <b>shimmering</b> earnest lead vocal, stripped-to-the-bone simplicity, and a pristine romantic innocence." [...] The New York Times wrote that [...] "For many the song evokes a glittering, timeless vision of proms, sock hops and impossibly young love", and the Los Angeles Times concurred, calling it a [...] "nostalgic evocation of post-World War II youth culture." [...] Steve Propes, an author and music historian, remarked that [...] "It was the first of the ultra-romantic ballads that hit the nerve of teens at the time... It stood out because of the sincerity of the delivery." [...] Rolling Stone placed it at number 152 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and called it [...] "a pivotal record in the early development of rock & roll. The artless, unaffected vocals of the Penguins, four black high schoolers from L.A., defined the street-corner elegance of doo-wop." ...|$|E

Jetta {{would return to the}} promotion across the pond, becoming <b>a</b> regular for <b>Shimmer</b> tapings from October 2007's Volume 15 where she defeated Serena Deeb.

500|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} {{live for the}} first time at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. Gaga began the performance wearing a square-shaped head piece and an all-white cape as pre-recorded boos were quickly replaced by sound of cheers. Gaga then glided across the stage and was assisted by her dancers as she changed into a black sequin leotard and performed the intricate choreography seen in the song's corresponding music video. Throughout the performance she cycled through costumes and wigs she had previously employed throughout her career. She was also dancing with a Jeff Koons blue gazing ball, and had her face painted in the style of the single cover by one of her dancers. She concluded the performance by emerging from behind jungle-like scenery dressed in a seashell bikini ensemble, wearing a bigb londe curly wig and taking a bow.

500|$|Peter and Olivia (Anna Torv) {{are sent}} by Walter {{to observe the}} {{building}} as he monitors seismic equipment from the lab. Peter and Olivia go to a bar while waiting, where Olivia tries to kiss Peter but becomes uncomfortable, knowing {{of the influence of}} her parallel universe doppelganger, Fauxlivia (Torv), on Peter. Her emotional reaction triggers her ability to see once again the [...] "shimmer" [...] around Peter that marks him [...] as a native of the parallel universe. She excuses herself and steps outside for some fresh air, followed by Peter. Olivia notices a similar glow emanating from the windows of apartment 6B in the Rosencrantz building, owned by the widow Mrs. Alice Merchant (Phyllis Somerville). When Olivia and Peter enter the apartment, Olivia (but not Peter) can see <b>a</b> <b>shimmering</b> figure that Alice claims is the ghost of her late husband Derek (Ken Pogue). Walter surmises that the figure is a parallel Derek seen across a crack between the universes. If the crack widens, Walter predicts they would see occurrences of the same singularities that have plagued the parallel universe, and suggests the use of the same amber-like compound they had previously recovered ("The Ghost Network") to limit the damage. With Massive Dynamic's resources, they are able to recreate the amber and a release system to encase the building, but hold it in reserve as a last resort only.|$|E
500|$|Matthew Rolston {{directed}} the music video for [...] "The Climb", which premiered on Cyrus's Myspace page on February 11, 2009. The video commences {{with a shot}} of Cyrus holding a guitar and a suitcase as she begins to walk down a long path extending through a valley. At {{the end of the}} valley, the sun breaks out over a distant mountain. The entire scene is enhanced with computer-generated imagery. Cyrus has her hair tied in a bun and wears a traveling jacket, a gray tank top and cowboy boots. In a separate setting, Cyrus, wearing a gray short sleeve shirt and her hair loose, begins to sing [...] "The Climb" [...] beneath a blue spotlight in a purple room. The two settings alternate throughout the video. A vignetted scene from Hannah Montana: The Movie appears in front of Cyrus as she walks on the path. The video zooms into the scene and a montage of film clips plays, featuring Cyrus's character and her love interest, Travis Brody (played by Lucas Till) horseback riding. The video returns to Cyrus walking; she picks up a rose fallen on the path, then throws it behind her. As the video progresses, she also sees things such as a herd of horses and a shooting star cross her path. A new setting enters the video in which Cyrus dances in a purple room with a countdown or, occasionally, film clips projected on the wall behind her. Rain begins to pour in the path setting. Cyrus puts down her jacket, guitar case, suitcase and boots, and continues onwards with only her guitar strapped to her shoulder. More film clip montages play {{in the same manner as}} the first. As the last montage ends, Cyrus finally reaches the summit of a reddish, CGI mountain and triumphantly looks over the cliff's edge to watch the sun shining over <b>a</b> <b>shimmering</b> lake. An alternate version of the music video excluding the Hannah Montana: The Movie clips exists and was sent to several channels, including VH1.|$|E

Vanity Fair writer Josh Duboff described the performance as [...] "powerful and fairly straightforward, sedate even". E! Online's Bruna Nessif wrote that the singer [...] "absolutely stunned as she belted the sweet ballad, giving the audience a memorable show.

Mark Savage of BBC News opined, [...] " [...] unbilled, stripped-back performance of XO was undoubtedly the night's most flawless vocal". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian described her as [...] "clearly the star of the show". However, Mark Sutherland of the Rolling Stone gave a mixed review about the performance saying it was [...] "a bit... dull". At the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards on August 25, Beyoncé performed [...] "XO" [...] live during a medley consisting of songs from her self-titled album. She performed the song dressed in a bejeweled bodysuit and dedicated it to her fans as the closing track of her performance, stating [...] "This one is for my incredible fans. If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be on this stage". Nadeska Alexis from MTV News felt that the singer kept the audience [...] "lifted" [...] with the performance of the song.|$|E
