40|$|AbstractThis study aims to {{investigate}} the effects of organizational structures and learning organization on job embeddedness <b>and</b> individual <b>adaptive</b> performance. In literature, studies suggest that learning organization and organizational structures bring about some desirable outputs for both individuals and organizations. Accordingly, {{within the scope of}} the study, job embeddedness <b>and</b> individual <b>adaptive</b> performance are considered as important consequences which have been thought to be affected by the organizational conditions. In this context, the data which were collected from 216 employees of hotel establishments by the survey method were analyzed using the structural equation modelling technique. The results of the study indicate that organic organization structure has been found to have no direct effect on job embeddedness <b>and</b> individual <b>adaptive</b> performance. In addition to this, mechanistic organization structure affects job embeddedness positively, while it has no direct effect on individual adaptive performance. However, learning organization affects both job embeddedness <b>and</b> individual <b>adaptive</b> performance positively <b>and</b> learning organization has a fully mediator role in the relationships between organic organization structure and job embeddedness. It also has a fully mediator role in the relationships between organic organization structure <b>and</b> individual <b>adaptive</b> performance. Moreover, learning organization has a fully mediator role between mechanistic organization structure <b>and</b> individual <b>adaptive</b> performance...|$|R
5|$|Both innate <b>and</b> <b>adaptive</b> {{immunity}} {{depend on}} the ability of the immune system to distinguish between self and non-self molecules. In immunology, self molecules are those components of an organism's body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system. Conversely, non-self molecules are those recognized as foreign molecules. One class of non-self molecules are called antigens (short for antibody generators) and are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response.|$|E

5|$|Horizontal gene {{transfer}} {{refers to the}} transfer of genetic material through a mechanism other than reproduction. This mechanism is a common source of new genes in prokaryotes, sometimes thought to contribute more to genetic variation than gene duplication. It is a common means of spreading antibiotic resistance, virulence, <b>and</b> <b>adaptive</b> metabolic functions. Although horizontal {{gene transfer}} is rare in eukaryotes, likely examples have been identified of protist and alga genomes containing genes of bacterial origin.|$|E
5|$|Dendritic cells (DC) are phagocytes in tissues {{that are}} {{in contact with the}} {{external}} environment; therefore, they are located mainly in the skin, nose, lungs, stomach, and intestines. They are named for their resemblance to neuronal dendrites, as both have many spine-like projections, but dendritic cells are in no way connected to the nervous system. Dendritic cells serve as a link between the bodily tissues and the innate <b>and</b> <b>adaptive</b> immune systems, as they present antigens to T cells, one of the key cell types of the adaptive immune system.|$|E
5|$|Dendritic cells {{bridge the}} {{innate immune system}} <b>and</b> <b>adaptive</b> immune system. They are {{increased}} in psoriatic lesions and induce the proliferation of T cells and type 1 helper T cells (Th1). Targeted immunotherapy as well as psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy can {{reduce the number of}} dendritic cells and favors a Th2 cell cytokine secretion pattern over a Th1/Th17 cell cytokine profile. Psoriatic T cells move from the dermis into the epidermis and secrete interferon-γ and interleukin-17. Interleukin-23 is known to induce the production of interleukin-17 and interleukin-22. Interleukin-22 works in combination with interleukin-17 to induce keratinocytes to secrete neutrophil-attracting cytokines.|$|E

5|$|Journal The Library Quarterly {{published}} an article by Eliza T. Dresang which classed Not in Front of the Children as an effective treatise on the harmful to minors doctrine. Dresang wrote that Heins had successfully shown that this doctrine, which served as the core basis for legislation including the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA), was demonstrably impossible to prove. She concluded that Heins concisely argued censorship of works from the reach of children can have negative impacts on their level of innovation, healthy mental growth, <b>and</b> <b>adaptive</b> abilities. Writing in English Journal, Tonya Perry discussed the work and emphasized that if the motivation behind children's education was to produce independent critical thinkers, {{it was necessary to}} extend the limits of censorship.|$|E
5|$|Gamma delta T cells (γδ T cells) {{possess an}} {{alternative}} T-cell receptor (TCR) {{as opposed to}} CD4+ and CD8+ (αβ) T cells and share the characteristics of helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells and NK cells. The conditions that produce responses from γδ T cells are not fully understood. Like other 'unconventional' T cell subsets bearing invariant TCRs, such as CD1d-restricted Natural Killer T cells, γδ T cells straddle the border between innate <b>and</b> <b>adaptive</b> immunity. On one hand, γδ T cells are a component of adaptive immunity as they rearrange TCR genes to produce receptor diversity and can also develop a memory phenotype. On the other hand, the various subsets {{are also part of}} the innate immune system, as restricted TCR or NK receptors may be used as pattern recognition receptors. For example, large numbers of human Vγ9/Vδ2 T cells respond within hours to common molecules produced by microbes, and highly restricted Vδ1+ T cells in epithelia respond to stressed epithelial cells.|$|E

Injury type was hypothesized to moderate the relationship between parental distress <b>and</b> child <b>adaptive</b> functioning, demonstrating a significantly stronger relationship in the TBI relative to OI group.

Groups (TBI n= 21, OI n= 23) did not differ significantly on age at injury, time since injury, sex, race, or SES. Parents completed the Brief Symptom Inventory, Parenting Practices Questionnaire, and Vineland-II. Moderation and mediation hypotheses were tested using hierarchical multiple regression and a bootstrapping approach, respectively. Results supported moderation and revealed that higher parental psychological distress was associated with lower child adaptive functioning in the TBI group only. Mediation results indicated that higher parental distress was associated with authoritarian parenting practices <b>and</b> lower <b>adaptive</b> functioning across groups. Results suggest that parenting practices are an important area of focus for studies attempting to elucidate the relationship between parent and child functioning following TBI...|$|R
