5|$|CPG is {{commonly}} defined by its pore size. In oligonucleotide chemistry, pore sizes of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 3000Å {{are used to}} allow the preparation of about 50, 80, 100, 150, and 200-mer oligonucleotides, respectively. To make native CPG suitable for further processing, {{the surface of the}} material is treated with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane to give aminopropyl CPG. The aminopropyl arm may be further extended to result in long chain aminoalkyl (LCAA) CPG. The amino group is then used as an <b>anchoring</b> <b>point</b> for linkers suitable for oligonucleotide synthesis (see below).|$|E
500|$|Starting in December, the French, {{under the}} command of Colonel Christian de Castries, began {{transforming}} their <b>anchoring</b> <b>point</b> into a fortress by setting up seven satellite positions. (Each was said to be named after a former mistress of de Castries, although the allegation is probably unfounded, as the eight names begin with letters from the first nine of the alphabet, excluding F.) The fortified headquarters was centrally located, with positions [...] "Huguette" [...] to the west, [...] "Claudine" [...] to the south, and [...] "Dominique" [...] to the northeast. The other positions were [...] "Anne-Marie" [...] to the northwest, [...] "Beatrice" [...] to the northeast, [...] "Gabrielle" [...] to the north, and [...] "Isabelle" [...] to the south, covering the reserve airstrip.|$|E
500|$|The sail of Dimetrodon {{is formed}} by {{elongated}} neural spines projecting from the vertebrae. Each spine varies in cross-sectional shape from its base to its tip {{in what is}} known as [...] "dimetrodont" [...] differentiation. Near the vertebra body, the spine cross section is laterally compressed into a rectangular shape, and closer to the tip, it takes on a figure-eight shape as a groove runs along either side of the spine. The figure-eight shape is thought to reinforce the spine, preventing bending and fractures. A cross section of the spine of one specimen of Dimetrodon giganhomogenes is rectangular in shape but preserves figure-eight shaped rings close to its center, indicating that the shape of spines may change as individuals age. The microscopic anatomy of each spine varies from base to tip, indicating where it was embedded in the muscles of the back and where it was exposed as part of a sail. The lower or proximal portion of the spine has a rough surface that would have served as an <b>anchoring</b> <b>point</b> for the epaxial muscles of the back, and also has a network of connective tissues called Sharpey's fibers that indicate it was embedded within the body. Higher up on the distal (outer) portion of the spine, the bone surface is smoother. The periosteum, a layer of tissue surrounding the bone, is covered in small grooves that presumably supported the blood vessels that vascularized the sail.|$|E

As mentioned before, we believe that positive feedback represented by a user <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> should gradually become reliable if more and more similar user <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> are generated to confirm it. Before we discuss how to update the reliability of user anchors, we define the similarity between two user <b>anchor</b> <b>points.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{process of}} folding begins when {{the cells in}} the central region of the neural plate, the medial hinge point cells, bind to the {{notochord}} beneath them. [...] This creates a central <b>anchoring</b> <b>point</b> for the process of folding to occur, and subsequently creates the neural groove. [...] As the neural folds continue to extend, dorsolateral hinge points form, allowing the folds to curve into a tube-like structure. [...] When the peaks of the folds (known as the neural crest regions) touch, they merge and involute, creating the neural tube beneath the newly formed epidermal layer.|$|E
5000|$|A {{sarcomere}} {{is defined}} as the segment between two neighbouring Z-lines (or Z-discs, or Z bodies). In electron micrographs of cross-striated muscle, the Z-line (from the German [...] "Zwischenscheibe", the disc in between the I bands) appears as a series of dark lines. They act as an <b>anchoring</b> <b>point</b> of the actin filaments.|$|E
50|$|Anchorage Island is {{an island}} about 1 km long and 0.5 km wide, {{approximately}} 2 km north-west of Davis Station. It was mapped by Norwegian cartographers from aerial photographs taken by the Lars Christensen Expedition (1936-37). Its name {{comes from the fact}} that ships arriving to relieve Davis Station used the island as an <b>anchoring</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
30|$|The Virtual Mobility Control Domain (VMCD) [22] is a {{distributed}} system that activates multiple <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> and manages binding information like an HA. Under VMCD, an MN first reaches the CN via its HA with a bidirectional tunnel. The first packet {{sent by the}} CN is routed to an MN via the closet <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> to the CN. After receiving tunneled packets from the <b>anchor</b> <b>point,</b> the MN starts using the <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> instead of the HA. Therefore, the transmission path can be optimized. The CN {{does not have to}} support any new protocol in the VMCD approach. However, the binding cache in an <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> needs to be synchronized with other <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> via explicit or implicit signaling. Thus, the VMCD system maintenance cost is very high.|$|R

40|$|The {{spatially}} resolved chemiluminescence at {{the flame}} front and <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> of a laminar premixed propane/air flame {{was measured in}} this study. The flame front structure, <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> location, and local equivalence ratio were examined for different values of the equivalence ratio f ranging from 0. 9 to 1. 5 using the chemiluminescence spectra. Local point-measurements of the chemiluminescence were obtained using a developed Cassegrain optics system, which had a spatial resolution of d = 0. 08 mm and L = 0. 6 mm, sufficient to measure the detailed location of the <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> and the flame front shape. The <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> was not in the same location for different values of f. The lower <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> was located 0. 3 mm above the rim and at a radial distance of 6. 8 mm when f = 1. 0, 1. 1, and 1. 2, and the <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> location trace was a V shape. The equivalence ratio of the <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> was calculated from the relationship of the OH*/CH * intensity and the local equivalence ratio, and the measured value was constant for different values of f. The detailed OH * and CH* spectra demonstrated that the chemistry at the <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> was dominated by the same processes for different equivalence ratios. The local equivalence ratio at the <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> was between 0. 7 and 0. 8 for all experimental conditions. The temperature at the <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> was estimated using the detailed OH * R and P branch intensity ratio used for plasma diagnostics. The results indicate that the temperature {{at the flame front}} was relatively constant, although the temperature at the <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> showed remarkable changes that could be predicted from the heat loss...|$|R
5000|$|Non-vibrato bridges supply an <b>anchoring</b> <b>point</b> for {{the strings}} but provide no active control over string tension or pitch. A {{small group of}} vibrato bridges have an {{extended}} tail (also called [...] "longtail"). These guitars have more reverb in their sound, because of the string resonance behind the bridge.

Though {{it is not}} a {{physical}} restraint by itself, {{it can be used to}} provide an <b>anchoring</b> <b>point</b> for other restraints, such as bondage cuffs, rope, etc. Lengths of simple leather strapping with buckles are sometimes also referred to as bondage belts, because they can be used quickly to bind limbs.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{methods to}} detect key <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> in 3 D face scanner data. These <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> {{can be used}} to estimate the pose and then match the test image to a 3 D face model. We present two algorithms for detecting face <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> in the context of face verification; One for frontal images and one for arbitrary pose. We achieve 99 % success in finding <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> in frontal images and 86 % success in scans with large variations in pose and changes in expression. These results demonstrate the challenges in 3 D face recognition under arbitrary pose and expression. We are currently working on robust fitting algorithms to localize more precisely the <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> for arbitrary pose images. ...|$|R
40|$|Alignment {{of large}} genomic {{sequences}} {{is a fundamental}} task in computational genome analysis. Most methods for genomic alignment use high-scoring local alignments as <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> to reduce the search space of the alignment procedure. Speed and quality of these methods therefore depend on the underlying <b>anchor</b> <b>points.</b> Herein, we propose to use Filtered Spaced Word Matches to calculate <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> for genome alignment. To evaluate this approach, we used these <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> in the the widely used alignment pipeline Mugsy. For distantly related sequence sets, we could substantially {{improve the quality of}} alignments produced by Mugsy...|$|R

5000|$|Anchoring and adjustment: {{used when}} making {{judgments}} with uncertainties. One will {{start with an}} <b>anchoring</b> <b>point,</b> then adjust it to reach an assumption. For example, if you are asked to estimate how many people will take Dr. Smith's biology class this spring, you may recall that 38 students took the class in the fall, and adjust your estimation based on whether the class is more popular in the spring or in the fall.|$|E
3000|$|We {{verified}} {{the qualitative}} patterns illustrated in Fig.  3 quantitatively by testing whether preference ratios {{defined by the}} task-relevant dimension (based on <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> preferences from the task-relevant single-dimension task) were more systematic than preference ratios defined by the task-irrelevant dimension (based on <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> preferences from the task-irrelevant single-dimension task) during the orthogonal task. Specifically, we conducted a repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the absolute values of preference ratios with task (size-relevant, contrast-relevant) as a between-groups factor and preference ratio dimension (size, contrast) as a within-subject factor. There was a significant interaction between task and preference ratio dimension [F(1, 24) = 50.24, p < [...]. 001]; post hoc tests revealed that absolute preference ratios in the size-relevant orthogonal task were significantly higher when they were defined by size <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> than when defined by contrast <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> [t(13) = 4.22, p < [...]. 01], whereas absolute preference ratios in the contrast-relevant orthogonal task were significantly higher when they were based on contrast <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> than when based on size <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> [t(11) = 6.02, p < [...]. 001] (Fig.  4). Thus, participants’ eye movements were guided primarily by <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> from the task-relevant dimension during the orthogonal task.|$|R
50|$|<b>Anchor</b> <b>Point</b> {{was first}} settled by Robert Bartlett, a British seaman, and his nephew Robert Genge, both from Yeovil, Somerset, England in 1740. They used the cove {{as a base}} for fishing and fur hunting from <b>Anchor</b> <b>Point</b> to Bartlett's Harbour in the late 18th century. Robert Bartlett {{eventually}} returned to England while Robert Genge was joined by his brother Abram, who employed men from England seasonally to sell his furs and fish to American vessels. Trapping, salmon fishing and sealing were very important industries of <b>Anchor</b> <b>Point</b> in the 19th century. His descendant, William Genge, was the first Waymaster in 1885. By the 1850s, <b>Anchor</b> <b>Point</b> was established as a commercial center for fur trading and fishing on the St. Barbe coast. The land around <b>Anchor</b> <b>Point</b> was also very productive with excellent pasture which led to extensive cultivation of the land and the raising of livestock.|$|R

30|$|<b>Anchor</b> <b>point</b> {{distributions}} are instead {{dependent upon}} {{the complexity of the}} topographical features, which is independent of any specific sensor measurements. However, sensor observation made at any given location within the region can still be used to update the uncertainty model of the neighboring <b>anchor</b> <b>point(s).</b> To achieve that, we further assume that more points will be used to model an area with lower spatial correlation, such that the elevation at a given location can be interpolated or extrapolated with neighboring anchors with sufficient accuracy. Thus, a surficial feature with topographic complexity is covered with densely populated <b>anchor</b> <b>points,</b> whereas less topographically complex areas are covered with a sparse scatter of <b>anchor</b> <b>points.</b>|$|R
30|$|Another {{method for}} {{securing}} micro-mobility {{that is more}} reasonable for hierarchical mobility domains is presented in [17]. It focuses on the authentication of the location-binding update messages to prevent the possible security issues such as man-in-the-middle attack and DoS. It uses regional <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> which supports the dynamic binding between the end-point identifiers and their IP addresses. Once an MN enters a given region, it {{does not need to}} register at any mobility <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> within that region. During the SA establishment, mobility <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> in the region learn the required security context and current location information of the MN, while the nearest <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> (NAP) only knows the shared secret key of the communication session. The solution is based on the use of Lamport one-way hash chains and secret-splitting techniques to bind the messages of location updates (LU) together and to establish a SA between the MN and the nodes (e.g., <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> in a domain) along the path of the MN and CN.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{automatically}} finding curves rep-resenting the sulcal fundi on the human brain cortex. A flat-tened map of the cortical surface is used as the reference space in which the curves are modeled. The map {{is also used to}} transfer planar curves back to the cortical surface to extract sulcal fundal curves. Instead of modeling the curves by densely sampled landmark points, as it is done in the traditional active shape models, we model sulcal curves by a small number of <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> that correspond to salient features, such as end points or points of intersections. The full sulcal curves connecting the <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> are recon-structed by an extension of the fast marching method. Each <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> carries a wavelet based attribute vector whose goal is to provide a distinctive morphological signature for the <b>anchor</b> <b>point.</b> This allows us to efficiently solve the problem in a low-dimensional space. Moreover, because each <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> has this signature, and because <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> are chosen to be salient features, the cost function defined in this low-dimensional space is presumed to have few local minima. Experimental results show that the sul-cal curves extracted using the automatic method agrees well with the manually drawn sulcal curves. ...|$|R
