The impact of these three factors was studied independently, {{in order to understand}} the importance of each of them for biomass productivity and, consequently, determine the main driving factors. The results showed a stronger effect of precipitation during the growing season on biomass productivity, in both field and greenhouse trials, thus highlighting this factor, among the three studied, as the major driver of biomass response and consequently of future changes in the landscape of montado <b>agro-sylvo-pastoral</b> <b>system</b> in Alentejo. The comparison of field and greenhouse trial was also intended to study the seedbank ability to retain information regarding the past climate history of its site of origin – ‘memory’. Results showed that in greenhouse, regardless of the locations from where the soil samples were taken, the seed bank responded similarly in terms of biomass production, vegetation cover, species richness and flowering onset when subjected to similar favorable conditions in the greenhouse – regular and abundant watering.

40|$|Based on archival {{documentation}} and bio-stratigraphic evidence from {{a selection of}} case studies in North West Italy, this article investigates the historical ecology of chestnut cultivation in Liguria, the sites discussed {{are considered to be}} of national and international relevance, as illustrated through their inclusion in European rural heritage inventories. During their investigation in this article, field and laboratory research (particularly historical ecology surveys, archaeobotany and environmental archaeology) are interpreted in tandem with archival sources, the intention of which is to contextualise the chestnut cultivation, as part of a complex <b>agro-sylvo-pastoral</b> <b>system,</b> within a wider socio-ecological framework. As a result an increased understanding of the historical ecology of chestnut cultivation can be beneficial to the future planning and management of its role within various environments and landscapes...|$|E
40|$|The {{contributions}} of California and Spanish oak woodlands to owners, neighbors, and society are undervalued. Recent Spanish studies {{have begun to}} identify the components of value provided by traditional oak woodland <b>agro-sylvo-pastoral</b> <b>systems,</b> including environmental and self-consumption values. Work in California has revealed that self-consumption by owners, benefits to neighboring properties, and benefits to the larger society are important components of the total valuation of traditional low-intensity oak woodland ranching. In Spain, this type of bioeconomic analysis, known as “Total Economic Value, ” engages an institutional framework at pan-European, national, and regional levels as the full economic values of low-intensity agriculture are increasingly recognized and supported by subsidies and public policy initiatives. In California oak woodlands this accounting helps provide a means for assessing conservation investments by third party non-governmental organizations, and sheds light on oak woodland landowner behaviors crucial to efforts to conserve these mostly private lands. We embark on a course of research to conduct comparative bioeconomic analysis in Spain and California, including evaluation of the ecological outcomes of various scenarios, and the institutional leverage points for such information. This paper introduces ecological, economic, and institutional similarities and differences in the woodlands, with {{particular attention to the}} possibilities of comparative bioeconomic analyses...|$|R

Since 1991, the "Communal Forestry Development in the Bolivian Highlands (Altiplano) " {{project has}} been {{promoting}} self-supporting agroforestry activities, integrated into the farmerproductive system, boosting the satisfaction of needs in forest products, increasing agriculture production and conserving natural resources. High demands on land and the difficult climatic conditions prevailing in Potosi department, where the project is located, are serious constraints to a massive forestation. Taking these constraints into account, the project has developped a strategy, the Communal Forestry Development, which is focussed on an integrated and participative approach : "integrated" means the technical available alternatives, including agroforestry actions (promotion of forester, fruit, and forrage trees and shrubs) as well as hydraulic and soil conservation actions, are implemented inside the productive <b>agro-sylvo-pastoral</b> <b>systems.</b> Within the scope of an implication of the stakeholders, the project uses "participative" ways as communautary planning of agroforestry priorities. Those objectives are reached by means of training, extension and communication. Another orientation consists in a flexible coordination with all the organizations working on the field. The project is now implementing a second phase. The results which have been registered so far lead towards a strenghthening of integrated actions and increasing responsabilities of as well communities as other institutions. Such an orientation points out {{the necessity of a}} long-term and flexible project conception...|$|R
