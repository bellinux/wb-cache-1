25|$|Noten {{developed}} his Smartphone Jewels project {{as part of}} the contemporary jewelry exhibition Unleashed! held at the Dutch Museum voor Moderne Kunst Arnhem (MMKA) in Arnhem from November 4, 2011 until February 6, 2012. The exhibition is advertised throughout the Arnhem city center with posters that each carry a different QR-tag to be scanned by a smartphone. Each tag provides the smartphone user with additional information on jewelry related topics, i.e. the price of gold or political commentary on blood diamonds or a story about miners. When <b>all</b> <b>tags</b> are scanned the smartphone user receives an individual code that can be exchanged for a 3D-printed Noten gunring at the exhibition. Noten also designed a special 3D-printed glassfiber-filled nylon smartphone (iPhone) cover with daisies and a bicolor ring to match priced at €395.00.|$|E
500|$|Cayce Pollard – A 32-year-old {{woman who}} lives in New York City. She pronounces her given name [...] "Case" [...] {{although}} her parents named her after Edgar Cayce. She uses her interest in marketing trends and fads, and her psychological sensitivity to logos and advertising, in her work as an advertising consultant. Her sensitivity becomes a phobia towards older corporate mascots, especially the Michelin Man. She wears only black, gray or white, usually Fruit of the Loom shrunken cotton T-shirts (<b>all</b> <b>tags</b> removed) with Levis jeans (with the trademarks filed off the buttons) or skirts, tights, boots, {{as well as a}} black Buzz Rickson MA-1 bomber jacket.

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{noticeable}} differences between HTML and XHTML is the rule that <b>all</b> <b>tags</b> must be closed: empty HTML tags such as [...] must either be closed with a regular end-tag, or replaced by a special form: [...] (the space before the '/' on the end tag is optional, but frequently used because it enables some pre-XML Web browsers, and SGML parsers, to accept the tag). Another is that all attribute values in tags must be quoted. Finally, all tag and attribute names within the XHTML namespace must be lowercase to be valid. HTML, on the other hand, was case-insensitive.|$|E
25|$|We {{can define}} a partial {{order on the}} set of <b>all</b> <b>tagged</b> {{partitions}} by saying that one tagged partition is greater or equal to another if the former is a refinement of the latter.|$|R
3000|$|Given such a {{partition}}, we put Δ t_i=t_i-t_i- 1. A tagged partition {{consists of}} a partition and a sequence of tags {ξ _ 1, [...]..., ξ_m} such that ξ_i∈ [t_i- 1, t_i) for every i∈{ 1, [...]..., m}. The symbol D(a, b) denotes the set of <b>all</b> <b>tagged</b> partitions of [a, b]_T. If δ > 0, then the set of <b>all</b> <b>tagged</b> partitions of [a,b]_T such that, for every i∈{ 1, [...]..., m}, either Δ t_i≤δ or Δ t_i>δ and σ (t_i- 1)=t_i will be denoted by the symbol D_δ(a, b). For the last case, {{the only way to}} choose a tag in [t_i- 1, t_i) is to take ξ_i=t_i- 1.|$|R
40|$|The radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) technology has gained a lot of recent interests {{because it has been}} widely recognised as a foundation technology for the Internet of things. In current multi-reader RFID systems, readers work with fairly less cooperation and are responsible to retrieve data from different number of tags individually, which results in large reading time of obtaining <b>all</b> <b>tag</b> data. In this paper, a fast tag reading problem in multi-reader RFID systems with the goal of obtaining <b>all</b> <b>tag</b> data by using minimum reading time is studied. A distributed load-balancing algorithm based on diffusion method is proposed to solve the problem by migrating tags from highly loaded reader to lightly loaded reader. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of proposed algorithm. Department of Computin...|$|R
2500|$|The {{complexity}} and {{detail of the}} controls in the management plans can be indicated by a brief examination of the NSW plan. [...] It divides the State into 15 different zones, 14 in which commercial kangaroo harvesting is allowed and one comprising over one-third of the State in which no harvesting can take place. [...] The population is estimated in each individual zone and a harvest quota allocated to it. [...] An appropriate number of tags are then issued to the conservation authority managers in each zone, and these can only be obtained by kangaroo harvesters on two days of each month. [...] The harvester must use and submit reports for <b>all</b> <b>tags</b> issued before more can be obtained, {{and the issue of}} tags by zone is closely monitored. [...] As soon as the harvest in any one zone approaches the quota, it is closed to commercial activity {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E

Compared with other shopping data mining system that need to analyze <b>all</b> <b>tag</b> information, our system reduces the amount of calculation and improves the monitoring efficiency.|$|R

50|$|In January, 1988, Burlington Northern {{equipped}} 1,500 taconite (iron ore pellets) {{rail cars}} in northern Minnesota {{each with a}} GRS and an Amtech transponder.

50|$|The tags {{from each}} probe used for microarray-based {{captured}} region identification should have similar melting temperatures {{as well as}} maximal orthogonal base complexities. These ensure that <b>all</b> <b>tags</b> can be hybridized to the array under similar conditions and that cross-hybridizations are minimized, respectively.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{different}} methods of singulation, {{but the most}} common is [...] "tree walking", which involves asking <b>all</b> <b>tags</b> with a serial number that starts with either a 1 or 0 to respond. If more than one responds, the reader might ask for <b>all</b> <b>tags</b> with a serial number that starts with 01 to respond, and then 010. It keeps doing this until it finds the tag it is looking for. Note that if the reader has {{some idea of what}} tags it wishes to interrogate, it can considerably optimise the search order. For example with some designs of tags, if a reader already suspects certain tags to be present then those tags can be instructed to remain silent, then tree walked without interference from them, and then finally they can be queried individually.|$|E

5000|$|Tags {{are single}} words prefixed by a [...] "@" [...] symbol. Tags inform parsers how to present {{information}} and modify display of documentation {{as well as}} allow the IDE to define variable types. <b>All</b> <b>tags</b> are optional, but {{if you use a}} tag, they do have specific requirements to parse properly.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, HTML 4.01 {{provides}} Transitional and Frameset DTDs, {{as explained}} below. Transitional type {{is the most}} inclusive, incorporating current tags as well as older or [...] "deprecated" [...] tags, with the Strict DTD excluding deprecated tags.

Which notes are displayed depend on which tag or tags are selected. Multiple tags can be selected to show only notes with <b>all</b> <b>tags,</b> or to show notes with some tags but not others.|$|E

5000|$|Attributes {{may also}} be {{assigned}} by the user to annotations and to labels. Attributes assigned to tags will either be permanently defined within the system — such as `bibliography` and [...] "`this text is a quotation` tags" [...] — or defined by the user.

50|$|This {{web based}} service {{builds on the}} Tagenerator tool, but is very fast because <b>all</b> <b>tags</b> are pre-generated and stored in a database. It is also a {{significant}} improvement since Webtag {{takes into account the}} interactions of the tag with the primers {{to be used in the}} experiment.

The station also dropped <b>all</b> <b>tags</b> {{at the end of}} each song, which gave the title and artist for each track. The station is now simply called [...] "Thunder 94-5" [...] as well.|$|E
