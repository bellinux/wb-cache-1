Other anticaking agents sometimes used include tricalcium phosphate, calcium or magnesium carbonates, fatty acid salts (acid salts), magnesium oxide, silicon dioxide, calcium silicate, sodium aluminosilicate and calcium aluminosilicate.

40|$|Experiments {{conducted}} in FY 01 previously indicated a potential cesium stripping {{problem in the}} CSSX process due {{to the presence of}} nitrite in the waste simulant. The stripping issue seemed all the more important as the nitrite concentration increased. Experiments presented in this work have demonstrated that the true reason for the cesium stripping problem was in fact the presence of an <b>anti-caking</b> <b>agent</b> in the,sodium nitrite. used for the preparation of the simulants. The <b>anti-caking</b> <b>agent</b> is actually a mixture of well-known surfactants, sodium mono- and di-methyl naphthalene sulfonate that can partition into the organic-phase on extraction, then retain cesium upon stripping. The effect was demonstrated by adding known amounts of the <b>anti-caking</b> <b>agent</b> to clean systems. Data suggest that rejuvenation of the solvent can be obtained by a caustic wash following the stripping stage...|$|R

50|$|Pickling salt is a salt {{that is used}} {{mainly for}} canning and {{manufacturing}} pickles. It is sodium chloride, as is table salt, but unlike most brands of table salt, it does not contain iodine or any anti caking products added. A widely circulated legend suggested that iodisation caused the brine of pickles to change color. This is false; however, some <b>anti-caking</b> <b>agents</b> are known to collect {{at the bottom of}} the jars, a minor aesthetic issue. Pickling salt is very fine-grained, to speed up dissolving in water to create a brine, so it is useful for solutions needing salt.|$|E
