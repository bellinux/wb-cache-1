500|$|The musical {{was well}} {{received}} by most critics. In his review for The Sentinel, Chris Blackhurst {{brought along a}} seven-year-old child called Dylan Brayford, and his 34-year-old godfather, James Humphreys, from Nantwich to watch the musical. The two [...] "weren't disappointed." [...] Blackhurst said [...] "The fast-paced tale of courage and dreams kept both entertained with plenty of hilarious moments {{for the children and}} a sprinkle of gags which flew over younger fans' heads but brought <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile</b> to mums and dads' faces." [...] Brayford summed it up, saying [...] "It was good, but not quite as good as the TV show." ...|$|E
500|$|Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express {{gave the}} film 2.5 (out of 5) stars, saying [...] "watch {{this one for}} Shah Rukh, who can still do the dimpled boy wonder and the older, mature lover with <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile</b> and wounded wink and sexy nudge." [...] Sukanya Verma (also from Rediff.com) {{described}} it as an [...] "elegant, harmless entertainer for [...] most part", praising the visuals, acting and music. She criticised the screenplay, contending that the film could have been [...] "snappier", and gave it 2.5 (out of 5) stars. Piyasree Dasgupta of First Post wrote: [...] "You have seen everything Jab Tak Hai Jaan has many times before, just in other films. And probably with far better music than A.R. Rahman threw into this one." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{talking to}} Quark (Armin Shimerman) in his bar, O'Brien realises {{that he can}} change {{the rules of the}} hunt before Tosk is taken away by the Hunters. He lies to Odo and convinces him to release Tosk into his care, {{claiming}} it is a Starfleet, [...] not a Bajoran matter. O'Brien escorts the Hunter and Tosk to an airlock, but the Chief has it rigged to overload, knocking out the Hunter, allowing O'Brien to help Tosk escape. In Ops, Sisko is informed about the situation and tells Odo to pursue the duo at a leisurely pace, giving O'Brien time to help Tosk escape the station with the Hunters in pursuit. [...] Later, an angry Sisko reprimands O'Brien for his actions; the Chief expresses his surprise at not being apprehended immediately by Odo. Sisko claims that he must have slipped up and gives O'Brien <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile.</b>|$|E
60|$|In the meanwhile, Wyllard turned to. Dampier with <b>a</b> little <b>wry</b> <b>smile.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{quite likely}} you're right," [...] and Nares {{looked at his}} comrade with <b>a</b> little <b>wry</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "Still, after all, I'm not sure it's very material." ...|$|R
6000|$|Desmond {{looked at}} her with <b>a</b> little <b>wry</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "Miss Figuera," [...] he said slowly, [...] "I think I would gladly do a very great deal for you." ...|$|R
500|$|On tagging {{first base}} after Cabrera's relay, Galarraga began celebrating his accomplishment. His {{immediate}} reaction to Joyce's on-field ruling was a momentary pause followed by <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile</b> at the umpire {{before returning to}} the mound. Galarraga told reporters after the game that the outing [...] "was my best game, so far", and said that Joyce [...] "probably feels more bad than me. Nobody's perfect. Everybody's human. I understand. I give the guy {{a lot of credit for}} saying, 'I need to talk to you.' You don't see an umpire tell you that after a game. I gave him a hug." [...] He also told reporters, [...] "I know that I pitched a perfect game, I believe I got it. I said before, I got a perfect game. I'm going to show my son. Maybe it's not in the book, but I'm going to tell my son, 'One time I got a perfect game.' I'll show him the CD," [...] further calling his effort [...] "the first 28-out perfect game". Tigers' manager Jim Leyland added, [...] "It's a crying shame. Jim [...] is a class guy. This sounds crazy, but after looking at the play, nobody is going to feel worse than he does. I yelled a bit after the game because emotions are high. You just want it so bad for the kid. I don't think you're as mad at the umpire as mad the kid didn't get itâ€”and he did deserve it." [...] Leyland also said that Joyce's call was part of the [...] "human element of the game".|$|E
60|$|Nasmyth {{was silent}} for several moments; {{then he turned to}} the other two men with <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{this kind}} of thing happens often, the fellows who hold my notes will get a painful shock," [...] he thought, with <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile,</b> and closed his eyes.|$|E
6000|$|<b>A</b> little <b>wry</b> <b>smile</b> {{crept into}} Courthorne's face. [...] "Don't worry," [...] he said. [...] "I had {{no wish to}} wait for the jury, and you can't get at an injury that's inside me." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{pulls down}} {{the corners of}} his mouth in <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> deprecatory <b>smile,</b> eyes us obliquely under a {{crumpled}} brow, shrugs his shoulders, and shows us the palms of his hands.|$|R
60|$|Courthorne made {{a little}} gesture that might have meant anything, and then he swung round {{abruptly}} without another look at her. When the door dosed behind him he went down the corridor with <b>a</b> little <b>wry</b> <b>smile</b> in his eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thought you'd like it--it's {{a pretty}} chair. We bought it and don't want it. No need {{for you to}} have it, don't be frightened,' said Birkin, with <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile.</b>|$|E
60|$|Maxwell spoke thickly, {{but there}} was <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile</b> on his lips {{as he watched the}} big dark-skinned alien, who, rending his cotton robe, bound a pad of wet leaves upon the injured side.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was with}} <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile</b> {{he watched a}} man ride off towards the {{settlement}} with it. [...] "I shall not be sorry when the climax comes," [...] he said. [...] "The strain is telling." ...|$|E
60|$|Jefferson {{turned to}} him slowly, {{and there was a}} curious stillness among those who watched them. Austin was glad of the hum of the big pump and the {{pounding}} of the engine, for he felt that silence would have made the tension unendurable. Then Jefferson <b>smiled,</b> <b>a</b> little <b>wry</b> <b>smile.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Jefferson <b>smiled,</b> <b>a</b> curious, <b>wry</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "It's hard--the toughest {{thing one}} can do--just to keep still; but if I climbed {{up and down}} that ladder for two hours I'd {{probably}} break out, and heave somebody into the creek. There are {{things you have to}} get over once for all--and do it quick." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I {{suppose it}} is. Some of those {{pictures}} must be pretty, or the tourists wouldn't buy them, but that doesn't go very far, after all." [...] He stopped a moment, {{and then went}} on with <b>a</b> little <b>wry</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "No doubt some patients require drastic treatment, and there are cases where it is necessary to use the knife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} generous." [...] The words vibrated with sincerity. [...] "Once--always--I have cruelly wronged you----" [...] but here Geoffrey {{raised his hand}} {{and looked at the}} girl with <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile</b> that had no mirth in it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes!" [...] said Valentine, with <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile</b> in his eyes. [...] "I {{have tried}} them both, {{and that is}} one reason why I'm here. You haven't {{answered}} me; though, after all, I guess it's an unnecessary question." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>A</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile</b> and a {{shake of}} the head was Tremayne's only answer; and then Carruthers came in fresh from Lisbon, {{where he had been}} upon {{business}} connected with the commissariat, and to Tremayne's relief the subject was perforce abandoned.|$|E
6000|$|The {{man looked}} down on her with <b>a</b> little <b>wry</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "I haven't told it often, but you shall hear," [...] he said. [...] "It's a tale of a black failure." [...] He {{stretched}} out a hand {{and pointed to the}} sliding fog and ranks of tumbling seas. [...] "It was very much this kind of night, and we were lying, reefed down, off one of the Russians' beaches, when I asked for volunteers. I got them--two boats' crews of the finest seamen that ever handled oar or sealing rifle." ...|$|R
6000|$|Herbert {{rose and}} paced slowly {{across to the}} window. 'The longer I live, Lawford, the more I curse this futile gift of speech. Here am I, wanting to tell you, to say out frankly what, if mind could appeal direct to mind, would be merely as the wind passing through the leaves of a tree with just one--one multitudinous rustle, but which, if I tried to put into words--well, daybreak would find us still groping on....' He turned; <b>a</b> {{peculiar}} <b>wry</b> <b>smile</b> on his face. 'It's a dumb world: but there we are. And some day you'll come again.' ...|$|R
60|$|Ormsgill went, and {{crossing}} the hot space {{of dust and}} sand walked into the hut. Dazzled as he was by the change from the glare outside, he could see almost nothing {{for a moment or}} two. The place was also filled with an acrid haze, but by degrees he became accustomed to the dimness and made out Gavin lying against the wall. He looked up with <b>a</b> little <b>wry</b> <b>smile,</b> but Ormsgill moving nearer saw that his face was gray and drawn. There was dust on his thin duck clothing, and in two spots a small dark-colored stain.|$|R
60|$|Tarzan {{stooped to}} examine the ground. He found that a large shrub had been torn up by the roots. Then he found {{something}} else. There was <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile</b> {{on his face as}} he rose and turned toward the girl.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know much}} about these things--at least, I've forgotten," [...] said Jolyon with <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile.</b> He himself had {{had to wait for}} death to grant him a divorce from the first Mrs. Jolyon. [...] "Do you wish me to see her about it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Aylward {{shrugged his}} broad shoulders, and <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile</b> dawned upon his rugged face. [...] "I am indeed as limp as a wetted bowstring," [...] said he. [...] "It {{is the nature}} of a man that he should be sad when he leaves the woman he loves." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{asked him}} {{outright}} {{whether it was}} he who had informed the N.K.V.D. of the contents of Krivitsky's [...] "Krusia" [...] letter to me. [...] "Did Serge Sedov show you that letter?" [...] <b>A</b> <b>wry,</b> pitiful <b>smile</b> on his distorted face and a shrug of the shoulders were his only reply. It was neither a confirmation nor a denial, just that helpless smile of his. It as the same with all the questions I asked about Ludwick's murder. Only a shrug of the shoulders. I knew then without a doubt who had informed the N.K.V.D.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after the}} riot, Wainwright returns to Brixton prison and Mackay returns from his course. Mackay warns Fletcher and Godber {{that he will}} be {{enforcing}} a new regime where their lives will be made a misery. Despite this, every prisoner greets Mackay with a chorus of For He's a Jolly Good Fellow, which Mackay reacts to with <b>a</b> <b>wry,</b> almost appreciative <b>smile.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He {{broke off}} for a moment with <b>a</b> little <b>wry</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "In my case they were serious. There was a woman of hysterical {{temperament}} with a diseased imagination. I was overworked and a trifle overwrought, and had a glass of brandy too much at a certain committee lunch. Then there was a rather delicate operation in a hospital, and though I'm not sure yet that I blundered, {{it was suggested that}} I did, and the thing was complicated by what the woman said when the committee took it up. It didn't matter that the patient recovered, for when he took action against the woman, the thing made a sensation in the Eastern papers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see," [...] said Burton, with <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile,</b> [...] "how simple is the detective's job. Willie is a natural-born detective. He got {{everything}} wrong from A to Izzard, yet if it hadn't been for Willie {{we might not}} have cleared up the mystery so soon." ...|$|E
60|$|His {{lips were}} twisted into <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile,</b> {{and there was}} pain in the blue eyes that gleamed so vividly under his black brows, pain {{blending}} with the mockery of his voice. But of all this it was the mockery alone that was perceived by Miss Bishop; she resented it.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} the young man, with <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "Your years again protect you. But {{you have a}} son, and if by to-morrow it should come to pass {{that you have a}} son no more, you may account yourself, through this"--and again he pointed to the weal--"his murderer." ...|$|E
5000|$|TouchArcade's Spanner Spencer also responded positively, {{scoring the}} game 4.5 out 5, and arguing [...] "it {{is rife with}} lavish quirks, nods and winks toward {{those of us who}} grew up taking this stuff so seriously, but can now look back at it with <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> and {{friendly}} <b>smile.</b> By casually lampooning itself, He-Man: The Most Powerful Game in the Universe is entirely accessible to both the young and old alike." ...|$|R
5000|$|Sam Cutler, {{the road}} {{manager for the}} tour, {{introduced}} the Rolling Stones as [...] "the greatest rock and roll band in the world", a title he had first bestowed upon them at their concert in London's Hyde Park the previous July. The tour set lists were derived mostly from 1968's Beggars Banquet album and the forthcoming Let It Bleed. The performance itself featured the Stones showmanship that would become familiar: Charlie Watts businesslike drumming leavened by <b>an</b> occasional <b>wry</b> <b>smile,</b> Bill Wyman's undertaker persona on bass, the guitar interplay of Mick Taylor with Keith Richards, {{and most of all}} Mick Jagger's prancing, strutting, leering and preening in front of the crowd. [...] "Ah think I've busted a button on my trousers, I hope they don't fall down" [...] he teased the audience. [...] "You don't want my trousers to fall down, now do ya?" [...] At one point in some shows, Jagger motioned for the audience to rush past ushers {{to the edge of the}} stage; of the group's reaction to the crowd's fervor, a spokesman said, [...] "They loved it." ...|$|R
60|$|Weston said nothing, but {{lay still}} with his pipe in his hand. There was before him a task {{from which he}} shrank, but he was {{worn-out}} and could not nerve himself to undertake it yet, and in the meanwhile {{he thought of his}} dead comrade with a certain regretful tenderness. The man had had no claim on him, and there had been much that was dissimilar in their natures, but they had, after all, borne many hardships together, and that counted for a good deal. Still, in one way he could not be sorry that Grenfell had gone on, for life, as he had said, had very little to offer this outcast. It was clear that the same thing held true in his own case, and he remembered with <b>a</b> little <b>wry</b> <b>smile</b> that Grenfell had said his share was to go to him if they found the mine. They had not found it, and there was no prospect of their doing so, for his faith in the project had vanished now that Grenfell was dead. It remained for them only {{to go back to the}} settlements, defeated.|$|R
