5|$|Rotavirus, norovirus, <b>adenovirus,</b> and astrovirus {{are known}} to cause viral {{gastroenteritis}}. Rotavirus {{is the most common}} cause of gastroenteritis in children, and produces similar rates in both the developed and developing world. Viruses cause about 70% of episodes of infectious diarrhea in the pediatric age group. Rotavirus is a less common cause in adults due to acquired immunity. Norovirus is the cause in about 18% of all cases.|$|E
5|$|HSP {{can develop}} after infections with streptococci (β-haemolytic, Lancefield group A), {{hepatitis}} B, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, Coxsackievirus, <b>adenovirus,</b> Helicobacter pylori, measles, mumps, rubella, Mycoplasma and numerous others. Drugs linked to HSP, usually as an idiosyncratic reaction, include the antibiotics vancomycin and cefuroxime, ACE inhibitors enalapril and captopril, anti-inflammatory agent diclofenac, {{as well as}} ranitidine and streptokinase. Several diseases {{have been reported to}} be associated with HSP, often without a causative link. Only in about 35% of cases can HSP be traced to any of these causes.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that the condition represents a state of heightened sensitivity to antigenic stimuli, with cross-reactivity of the resulting cell-mediated immune response with cells of the epithelium. Some hypothesize that aphthous stomatitis is caused by expression of HLA class II antigens along with the normally found HLA class I antigens in epithelial cells, which results in them being recognized by the immune system as foreign cells rather than self. Various antigenic triggers have been implicated as a trigger, including L forms of streptococci, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, <b>adenovirus,</b> and cytomegalovirus.|$|E

5|$|In adults, viruses {{account for}} {{approximately}} {{a third and}} in children for about 15% of pneumonia cases. Commonly implicated agents include rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), <b>adenovirus,</b> and parainfluenza. Herpes simplex virus rarely causes pneumonia, except in groups such as: newborns, persons with cancer, transplant recipients, and people with significant burns. People following organ transplantation or those otherwise-immunocompromised present high rates of cytomegalovirus pneumonia. Those with viral infections may be secondarily infected with the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, or Haemophilus influenzae, particularly when other health problems are present. Different viruses predominate at different periods of the year; during influenza season, for example, influenza may account for over half of all viral cases. Outbreaks of other viruses also occasionally occur, including hantaviruses and coronavirus.|$|E

All subgroup F adeno-viruses reacted with both RIVM anti-adenovirus type 40 (Ad 40) and anti-adenovirus type 41 (Ad 41) mono-clonal antibodies but were not detected by Adenoclone Type 40 / 41 enzyme immunoassay (EIA).

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{presence}} of human viruses (<b>adenoviruses,</b> enteroviruses, and hepatitis A viruses [HAVs]) in environmental and shellfish samples was carried out by applying DNA and cDNA amplification techniques by PCR. The detection of human <b>adenoviruses</b> by PCR was also examined as a potential molecular test to monitor viral pollution. The samples studied were urban and slaughterhouse sewage, river water, seawater, and shellfish. Enteroviruses were quantified by PFU in Buffalo green monkey kidney cells and fecal coliforms and phages of Bacteroides fragilis HSP 40 were also evaluated in some of the samples. The amplification of viral DNA and cDNA has shown a high prevalence of human viruses that would not be detected by the use of classical techniques, such as the quantification of PFU in cell lines. The results of the analysis of slaughterhouse sewage samples together with the test of farm animal feces indicate that the <b>adenoviruses</b> and the HAVs detected in the environment are mostly of human origin. A significative correlation between the detection of human viruses by PCR and the values of bacteriophages of B. fragilis HSP 40 in urban raw sewage was observed. Human <b>adenoviruses</b> were the viruses most frequently detected throughout the year, and all the samples that were positive for enteroviruses or HAVs were also positive for human <b>adenoviruses.</b> The results suggest that the detection of <b>adenoviruses</b> by PCR could be used as an index {{of the presence of}} human viruses in the environment where a molecular index is acceptable...|$|R

40|$|The Adenoviridae and Polyomaviridae {{families}} {{comprise a}} wide diversity of viruses {{which may be}} excreted for long periods in feces or urine. In this study, a preliminary analysis of the prevalence in {{the environment and the}} potential usefulness as source-tracking tools of human and animal <b>adenoviruses</b> and polyomaviruses has been developed. Molecular assays based on PCR specifically targeting human <b>adenoviruses</b> (HAdV), porcine <b>adenoviruses</b> (PAdV), bovine <b>adenoviruses</b> (BAdV), and bovine polyomaviruses (BPyV) were applied to environmental samples including urban sewage, slaughterhouse, and river water samples. PAdV and BPyV were detected in a very high percentage of samples potentially affected by either porcine or bovine fecal contamination, respectively. However, BAdV were detected in only one sample, showing a lower prevalence than BPyV in the wastewater samples analyzed. The 22 slaughterhouse samples with fecal contamination of animal origin showed negative results for the presence of HAdV. The river water samples analyzed were positive for the presence of both human and animal <b>adenoviruses</b> and polyomaviruses, indicating the existence of diverse sources of contamination. The identities of the viruses detected were confirmed by analyses of the amplified sequences. All BPyV isolates showed a 97 % similarity in nucleotide sequences. This {{is the first time that}} PAdV 5, BAdV 6, and BPyV have been reported to occur in environmental samples.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare PLC/PRF/ 5 and BGM cell lines for use in a total culturable viral assay (TCVA) of treated sewage effluents. Samples were collected before and after chlorination from an activated sludge wastewater treatment plant and from the effluent of a high-rate enhanced flocculation system, followed by UV light disinfection. Cell monolayers were observed for cytopathic effect (CPE) after two passages of 14 days each. Monolayers exhibiting viral CPE were tested for the presence of <b>adenoviruses</b> and enteroviruses by PCR or reverse transcription-PCR. Eight percent of the samples exhibited CPE on BGM cells, and 57 % showed CPE on PLC/PRF/ 5 cells. Only enteroviruses were detected on the BGM cells, while 30 % and 52 % of the samples were positive for enteroviruses and <b>adenoviruses,</b> respectively, on the PLC/PRF/ 5 cells. Thirty percent of the samples were positive for both <b>adenoviruses</b> and enteroviruses in chlorinated activated sludge effluent. Thirty percent of the samples were positive for <b>adenoviruses</b> in the UV treatment effluent, but no enteroviruses were detected. In conclusion, the PLC/PRF/ 5 cells were more susceptible than BGM cells to viruses found in treated sewage. The use of BGM cells for TCVA may underestimate viral concentration in sewage effluent samples. The PLC/PRF/ 5 cells were more susceptible to <b>adenoviruses,</b> which is important in the evaluation of UV disinfection systems because <b>adenoviruses</b> are highly resistant to UV inactivation...|$|R
