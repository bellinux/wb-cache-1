The commission came after Yamasaki's long convalescence and subsequent trip to Japan, and was his first opportunity to put into practice his re-envisionment of architecture. The Center was completed in 1958, and opened to immediate accolades from architectural magazines who called it [...] "delightful" [...] and [...] "refreshing," [...] and from the American Institute of Architects who awarded Yamasaki a First Honor Award for the design.
