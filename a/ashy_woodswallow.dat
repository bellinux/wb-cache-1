50|$|The <b>ashy</b> <b>woodswallow</b> (Artamus fuscus) {{sometimes}} {{also called}} the ashy swallow-shrike is a woodswallow which is found in south Asia. Like other woodswallows, it has a short curve bill and a short square tail and long wings. It is usually seen perched in groups, high on powerlines, tall bare trees and most often in areas with a predominance of tall palm trees.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ashy</b> <b>woodswallows</b> {{are usually}} seen in small groups. Several birds may sit huddled {{side-by-side}} {{on the bare}} branches of a tall tree or on high vantage points such as powerlines and pylons. From their perches, they make aerial sallies, flapping and gliding to capture insects in the air. Insects may {{be caught in the}} beak, transferred and held in their feet, torn up with their bill and swallowed without returning to the perch. They may also return to the perch with prey to feed and will sometimes sit on the ground and have been known to visit bird baths. Although mainly feeding on insects, they may take nectar from flowers of trees such as Erythrina. They have been recorded feeding on toxic butterflies of the family Danaiidae such as Euploea core which are avoided by other birds.The breeding season in India is March to June, the nest is a shallow cup placed at some height such as {{at the base of the}} frond of a tall palm or a hollow atop a street lighting post. The usual clutch consists of 2-3 greenish white eggs with brown spots. Both parents take part in nest building, incubation and feeding the young. They will mob larger birds such as crows and birds of prey that approach too close to the nesting birds. The song consists of a varied combination of wheezy notes that may include imitations of the calls of other birds. The usual call is shrill nasal chewk.|$|R
