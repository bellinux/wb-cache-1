50|$|<b>Alkaline</b> <b>paper</b> {{has a life}} {{expectancy}} of over 1,000 years for the best paper and 500 years for average grades. The making of <b>alkaline</b> <b>paper</b> has several other advantages {{in addition to the}} preservation benefits afforded to the publications and documents printed on it. Because there are fewer corrosive chemicals used in making <b>alkaline</b> <b>paper,</b> the process is much easier on the machinery, reducing downtime and maintenance, and extending the machinery's useful life. The process is also significantly more environmentally friendly. Waste water and byproducts of the papermaking process can be recycled; energy can be saved in the drying and refining process; and <b>alkaline</b> <b>paper</b> can be more easily recycled.|$|E
5000|$|... pH: {{the degree}} of acidity or {{alkalinity}} of a solution. <b>Alkaline</b> <b>paper</b> has a very long life. Acid paper deteriorates over time, which caused libraries to either take conservation measures or replace many older books.|$|E
50|$|The {{archives}} {{themselves are}} stored in protective packages made from high-quality, acid-free (<b>alkaline</b> buffered) <b>paper</b> and card, and sometimes inert polyester film. This provides both physical protection and a safe, non-acidic environment. Sturdy boxes are used to further shield files from light, dust, and disaster.|$|R
30|$|To {{model the}} pH-shift {{of paper in}} {{response}} to an uptake of a specific amount of acetic acid we assume the initial pH of paper to result from a single fully dissociated acid or base. Here below we will derive the formula for the pH-shift (Eq.  3 in the text) for <b>alkaline</b> <b>papers,</b> the equation for acid papers can be solved following the same line of reasoning. The paper is characterized by an initial hydronium ion concentration [H 3 O+] 0 which is measured in the water extract by macerating 1  g of paper in 70  mL of a 0.1  M NaCl water solution [63, 64]. After addition of a given amount of acetic acid the hydronium ion concentration will change to a new value [H 3 O+] which is as well measured in the water extract.|$|R
30|$|Whatman {{qualitative}} {{filter paper}} No. 3 (c. 27  cm diameter) with no further treatment {{was used as}} a support with a near neutral pH. For <b>alkaline</b> <b>papers,</b> either Whatman qualitative filter paper No. 3 was immersed in calcium hydroxide solution (pH c. 13) for 15  min and air dried, or commercially-obtained buffered acid-free tissue paper was used. For experiments involving unlaked carmine and tin-laked carmine only the tissue paper was used. An acidic paper was prepared by brushing Whatman qualitative filter paper No. 3 with a traditional gelatin/alum paper sizing solution prepared using a 2.5 % w/vol aqueous solution of gelatin mixed with alum in 100 : 1  wt% ratio [22, 23] and dried in air. The surface pH was measured using an Oakton Phelect flat electrode on the wetted surface of the papers to provide a general sense of the pH.|$|R

50|$|Pulp paper, however, {{contains}} acid {{which eventually}} destroys the paper from within. Earlier techniques for making paper used limestone rollers, which neutralized the acid in the pulp. Books printed between 1850 and 1950 are primarily at risk; more recent books are often printed on acid-free or <b>alkaline</b> <b>paper.</b> Libraries today {{have to consider}} mass deacidification of their older collections {{in order to prevent}} decay.|$|E
30|$|Effects of pH, sizing agent, and starch on {{the natural}} {{deterioration}} of 45 printed wood-free papers stored 1 – 32 years was investigated in terms of MIT folding endurance, brightness, and L*a*b* values. The neutral and <b>alkaline</b> <b>papers</b> retained their folding endurances well and significantly lost their yellow color (b*) during storage. The folding endurance of the acidic papers stored more than 15 years showed a declining trend with increased storage time. The sizing agent content in the papers stored more than 10 years increased {{and the amount of}} starch decreased with increasing storage years. A larger amount of the sizing agents correlated with less folding endurance and more yellow color of the papers. The relation between the starch content and the degree of yellow color of the papers was unclear, and the endurance of the papers increased with the increase in starch content.|$|R
50|$|Photographs {{that have}} not been {{properly}} fixed and washed can shift color over time through oxidation and acid migration. As with any photographic print, mordançage prints are degraded by exposure to light, humidity, and high temperatures. The mordançage solution is acidic, so these prints can contaminate other materials. Photographs can be interleaved with <b>alkaline</b> buffered <b>paper,</b> or sleeved in polyethylene to help prevent acid migration.|$|R
5000|$|... filler: {{a finely}} divided {{substance}} added to {{paper in the}} forming process. Fillers improve print quality, brightness and opacity. The most common fillers are clay and calcium carbonate. Titanium dioxide is a filler but also improves brightness and opacity. Use of calcium carbonate filler is the process called alkaline sizing and uses different chemistry than acid sizing. <b>Alkaline</b> sized <b>paper</b> has superior ageing properties.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are various}} {{standards}} for [...] "acid-free" [...] paper, with differing requirements. In some quarters, slightly-acidic paper having a pH between 6 and 7 is often also considered [...] "acid-free". Acid-free (<b>alkaline)</b> <b>paper</b> that additionally is uncoated and meets certain standards for folding and tearing is {{authorized by the}} American National Standards Institute (ANSI) to carry the following notice: [...] "The paper used in this publication meets the minimum requirements of the American National Standard for Information Sciences—Permanence of Paper for Printed Library Materials, ANSI/NISO Z39.48-1992." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the report}} filed for 1991, two related issues arose. First, it is {{difficult}} and yet paramount to know at its creation how much enduring value a document will have. An obvious {{solution to this problem}} would be to implement a system where all paper was permanent paper. Here we meet the second issue: permanent paper, in 1991, cost 30% more than acidic paper, thus making such a system not feasible. A recommendation was made to use a cheap but still <b>alkaline</b> <b>paper</b> for all publishing and permanent paper for the publishing of materials with known enduring value.|$|E
50|$|At first, {{in order}} {{to comply with the}} law, the acid-free paper or <b>alkaline</b> <b>paper</b> must meet {{standard}} JCP A 270 (JCP: Joint Committee on Printing) which is based on an ANSI standard (Z39.48-1984). JCP A 270 differs from Z39.48-1984 in that it is generally more demanding. Through later discussions a number of more lenient standards were created for different levels of documents. These include JCP A560 and JCP O-560. JCP O-560 relates specifically to paper used in photocopiers and laser printers. Written into the law was a provision that the heads of the Library of Congress, National Archives, and Government Printing Office were to report on how well the law was being implemented. The reports were to come out for the years 1991, 1993, and 1995.|$|E

40|$|In a {{comparative}} evaluation of seven procedures for determination of pH of paper, 55 different paper and pulp samples were used. Six procedures {{were based on}} cold extraction and subsequent determination of extract pH, either {{using a variety of}} combined pH electrodes or using a mixture of coloured acid/base indicators. One procedure involved impregnation of the sample with a solution of indicators and subsequent spectrophotometric determination of pH of air-dry samples. The correlation of determinations showed that most extraction methods give comparable data for acidic samples, with the exception of gelatine surface-sized samples. For samples with alkaline aqueous extracts, the effect of atmospheric CO 2 and slow dissolution of earth-alkali metal carbonates should be taken into account, which is not the case with any of the standardised methods for determination of paper pH. Since CO 2 enters into equilibria as a weak acid, it will decrease the equilibrium pH of solutions of CaCO 3 and MgCO 3, the difference amounting to more than 1. 5 pH units. A new procedure is therefore proposed for determination of pH of <b>alkaline</b> <b>papers</b> basing on rapid equilibration with CO 2 and dissolution of carbonates. The repeatability of determinations is satisfactory, providing data with standard deviation less than 0. 15 pH units. A discussion of the concept of paper pH follows, in view of the role of water content in air-dry paper and implications on stability of paper. The different procedures are compared in view of sample consumption, measurement repeatability and systematic error...|$|R
40|$|Alkyl ketene dimers (AKD) are {{effective}} and highly hydrophobic sizing agents for the internal sizing of <b>alkaline</b> <b>papers,</b> {{but in some}} cases they may form deposits on paper machines and copiers. In addition, alkenyl succinic anhydrides (ASA) - based sizing agents are highly reactive, producing on-machine sizing, but under uncontrolled wet end conditions the hydrolysis of ASA may cause problems. This thesis aims at developing an improved ketene dimer based sizing agent that would have a lower deposit formation tendency on paper machines and copiers than a traditional type of AKD. The aim is also to improve the ink jet printability of a AKD sized paper. The sizing characteristics ofketene dimers have been compared to those of ASA. A lower tendency of ketene dimer deposit formation was shown in paper machine trials and in printability tests when branched fatty acids were used in the manufacture of a ketene dimer basedsizing agent. Fitting the melting and solidification temperature of a ketene dimer size to the process temperature of a paper machine or a copier contributes to machine cleanliness. A lower hydrophobicity of the paper sized with branched ketene dimer compared to the paper sized with traditional AKD was discovered. However, the ink jet print quality could be improved by the use of a branched ketene dimer. The branched ketene dimer helps in balancing the paper hydrophobicity for both black and color printing. The use of a high amount of protective colloidin the emulsification was considered to be useful for the sizing performance ofthe liquid type of sizing agents. Similar findings were indicated for both the branched ketene dimer and ASA...|$|R
50|$|However, storage {{conditions}} certainly seem {{to contribute to}} the speed of the decay, as some bronzed CDs were already reported as unreadable in the mid-1990s, whereas others were still playable by 2012. As it was noted that CDs stored in paper sleeves were deteriorating sooner and faster than CDs stored in jewel cases, it is likely that storing CDs in an acid-free environment might slow down the bronzing effect. A minimum measure would be to remove the booklet and paper inlay from the CD's jewel case, though it might be advisable to store affected CDs in envelopes made of <b>alkaline</b> <b>paper</b> inside a box made of acid-free cardboard. Plastic or vinyl sleeves are not considered safe because the softening agents in the plastic may lead to further corrosion; polypropylene sleeves are a notable safe exception. Similar measures are used for books suffering from acid deterioration.|$|E
50|$|Another {{option to}} {{preserve}} brittle books is to perform paper splitting. This process dissects {{a book by}} its leaf and text attachment and treats each sheet of paper individually. Supervised by a book conservator, a paper conservator, and a conservation specialist, pages are literally pulled apart - fronts from backs - {{and a piece of}} <b>alkaline</b> <b>paper</b> is placed in between. The acid pages are then sandwiched back together with a non-acid buffer between them to slow the deterioration process. However, only ZFB (the Zentrum für Bucherhaltung) offers this procedure (also called mechanical paper splitting). They claim the process is so refined, they have successfully split cigarette paper. Washes will de-acidify the paper though they will remain brittle; but paper splitting increases the strength and flexibility of the paper via the extra new sheet of buffered paper and the ZFB process includes de-acidification washes.|$|E
5000|$|Battin {{directed}} the CPA in its comprehensive efforts {{to battle the}} acid paper problem. She was instrumental in organizing a national campaign {{for the use of}} <b>alkaline</b> <b>paper</b> in publishing companies. In 1988, on behalf of the Association of Research Libraries, the Commission on Preservation and Access, and the National Humanities Alliance, Battin testified before the U.S. House of Representatives, Subcommittee on Interior and Related Agencies (Committee on Appropriations) to propose a collaborative approach to preserving the nation's brittle books and to ask for an increase in federal funding for preservation microfilming. [...] Her testimony led to an increased appropriation of $8 million and the [...] "twenty-year brittle books preservation plan to microfilm three million endangered volumes, via the National Endowment for the Humanities Brittle Books Program.

40|$|A diagonal-electrophoresis {{method for}} the {{selective}} purification of serine phosphate peptides {{was applied to}} tryptic, chymotryptic and peptic digests of oxidized ovalbumin. This method {{is based on the}} release of the phosphate group bound to serine by treatment with <b>alkaline</b> phosphatase on <b>paper.</b> The identified serine phosphate peptides were purified by paper electrophoresis at pH 6 · 5 and 2 · 0, dephosphorylation with bacterial <b>alkaline</b> phosphatase, and <b>paper</b> electrophoresis at pH 2 · 0 again, in that order. The presence of two groups of serine phosphate peptides was apparent from the amino acid composition. One group contained no lysine, cysteic acid, proline, leucine or isoleucine (sequence 1) and the other had all those amino acids (sequence 2). Further degradation with subtilisin of those peptides and `dansyl'–Edman sequence analysis established their partial sequences. The proposed sequences are as follows (with `SerP' representing serine phosphate) : sequence 1, -Ala-Gly-Arg-Glu-Val-Val-Gly-SerP-Ala-Glu-Ala-Gly-Asp-Val-Ala-Ala-Ser-(Val,Glx 2,Ser,Phe) -Arg-; sequence 2, -Asp-Lys-Leu-Pro-Gly-Phe-Gly-Asp-SerP-Ile-Glx-Ala-Glx-CySO 3 H-Gly-(Thr,Ser,Val) -(Asp,His,Val) -.

40|$|International audienceThe {{global warming}} of Earth's near-surface, air and oceans {{in recent decades}} is a direct {{consequence}} of anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere such as CO 2, CH 4, N 2 O and CFCs. The CO 2 emissions contribute approximately 60 % to this climate change. This study investigates experimentally the aqueous carbonation mechanisms of an <b>alkaline</b> <b>paper</b> mill waste containing about 55 wt% portlandite (Ca(OH) 2) as a possible mineralogical CO 2 sequestration process. The overall carbonation reaction includes the following steps: (1) Ca release from portlandite dissolution, (2) CO 2 dissolution in water and (3) CaCO 3 precipitation. This CO 2 sequestration mechanism was supported by geochemical modelling of final solutions using PHREEQC software, and observations by scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction of final reaction products. According to the experimental protocol, the system proposed would favour the total capture of approx. 218 kg of CO 2 into stable calcite/ton of paper waste, independently of initial CO 2 pressure. The final product from the carbonation process is a calcite (ca. 100 wt%) -water dispersion. Indeed, the total captured CO 2 mineralized as calcite could be stored in degraded soils or even used for diverse industrial applications. This result demonstrates the possibility of using the alkaline liquid–solid waste for CO 2 mitigation and reduction of greenhouse effect gases into the atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe coal {{combustion}} fly-ash and <b>alkaline</b> <b>paper</b> mill waste were previously used to sequester CO 2 via waste-water-CO 2 interactions. For this case, a solid mixture (calcite and un-reacted waste) was obtained after carbonation process. In the present study, we propose a solid-water separation of free lime (CaO) or free portlandite (Ca(OH) 2) contained in waste prior to carbonation experiments {{in order to}} produce pure calcite or calcite/Se 0 red composite. The calcite and carbonate composite syntheses have been also independently studied, but for both cases, a commercial powdered portlandite was used as calcium source. For this study, the extracted alkaline-solution (pH = 12. 2 - 12. 4 and Ca concentration = 810 - 870 mg/L) from alkaline solid waste was placed in contact with compressed or supercritical CO 2 at moderate or high temperature, leading a preferential nucleation-growth of submicrometric particles of calcite (< 1 μm) with rhombohedral morphology at 90 °C and 90 bar (9 MPa), whereas a preferential nucleation-growth of nanometric particles of calcite (< 0. 2 μm) with scalenohedral morphology at 30 °C and 20 bar (2 MPa) were observed. When, the extracted alkaline-solution was placed in contact with supercritical CO 2 (90 bar) at high temperature (90 °C) and in presence of unstable seleno-l-cystine compound, the nucleation-growth of calcite/Se 0 red nano-composite taken place. The composite consisted predominantly of spherical, amorphous nanometric-to-submicrometric of elemental red selenium (< 500 nm) deposited on the calcite matrix. Here, the calcite was constituted by nano- to microrhombohedral crystals (< 2 μm) and micrometric agglomerates and/or aggregates (< 5 μm). These results on the particle size and morphology of crystal faces are very similar to calcite produced using commercial powdered portlandite as alkaline reactant and calcium source.
