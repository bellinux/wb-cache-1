5|$|Benioff and Weiss {{served as}} main writers and showrunners {{for the first}} season. They contributed eight out of ten episodes, {{including}} one co-written with Jane Espenson. The two remaining episodes were written by Bryan Cogman and <b>A</b> <b>Song</b> <b>of</b> Ice and Fire author George R. R. Martin.|$|E
5|$|Martin's inspirations {{included}} the Wars of the Roses and the French historical novels The Accursed Kings by Maurice Druon. <b>A</b> <b>Song</b> <b>of</b> Ice and Fire received praise for its diverse portrayal {{of women and}} religion, {{as well as its}} realism. An assortment of disparate and subjective points of view confronts the reader, and the success or survival of point of view characters is never assured. Within the often morally ambiguous world of <b>A</b> <b>Song</b> <b>of</b> Ice and Fire, questions concerning loyalty, pride, human sexuality, piety, and the morality of violence frequently arise.|$|E
5|$|The final segment {{in which}} the cast comes {{together}} is entitled Sharing Stories, where a story is told that explores interpersonal relationships and emotions.

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Song</b> <b>of</b> Ice and Fire {{takes place}} on the fictional continents Westeros and Essos. The {{point of view of}} each chapter in the story is a limited {{perspective}} of a range of characters growing from nine, in the first novel, to thirty-one by the fifth. Three main stories interweave a dynastic war among several families for control of Westeros, the rising threat of the supernatural Others in the northernmost reaches of Westeros, and the ambition of Daenerys Targaryen, the deposed king's exiled daughter, to assume the Iron Throne.|$|E
5|$|Game of Thrones {{is roughly}} {{based on the}} storylines of <b>A</b> <b>Song</b> <b>of</b> Ice and Fire, set in the fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and the {{continent}} of Essos. The series chronicles the violent dynastic struggles among the realm's noble families for the Iron Throne, while other families fight for independence from it.

5|$|HBO {{originally}} optioned {{the rights}} to <b>A</b> <b>Song</b> <b>of</b> Ice and Fire in 2007, at which time David Benioff and D. B.

The first and second drafts of the pilot script, written by Benioff and Weiss, were submitted in August 2007, and June 2008, respectively. While HBO found both drafts to their liking, a pilot was not ordered until November 2008, with the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike possibly delaying the process.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Song</b> <b>of</b> Ice and Fire {{takes place}} in a fictional world in which seasons last for years and end unpredictably. Nearly three centuries before the events of the first novel (see backstory), the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros were united under the Targaryen dynasty by Aegon I and his sisters Visenya and Rhaenys, with Aegon Targaryen {{becoming}} the first king of the whole of the continent of Westeros, save for the southerly Dorne. At the beginning of A Game of Thrones, 15 peaceful years have passed since the rebellion led by Robert Baratheon deposed and killed the last Targaryen king, Aerys II, and proclaimed Robert king of the Seven Kingdoms, with a nine year long summer coming to an end.|$|E
5|$|Benioff and Weiss {{originally}} intended to adapt the entire, still-incomplete <b>A</b> <b>Song</b> <b>of</b> Ice and Fire series of novels for television. After Game of Thrones began outpacing the published novels in the sixth season, the series {{was based on a}} plot outline of the future novels provided by Martin and original content. In April 2016, the showrunners' plan was to shoot 13 more episodes after the sixth season: seven episodes in the seventh season and six episodes in the eighth. Later that month, the series was renewed for a seventh season with a seven-episode order. , seven seasons have been ordered and filmed, adapting the novels {{at a rate of about}} 48 seconds per page for the first three seasons.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} Delius did not confine himself to purely orchestral works; he {{produced}} his final opera, Fennimore and Gerda (1908–10), like A Village Romeo and Juliet written in tableau form, {{but in his}} mature style. His choral works of the period, notably An Arabesque (1911) and <b>A</b> <b>Song</b> <b>of</b> the High Hills (1911) {{are among the most}} radical of Delius's writings in their juxtapositions of unrelated chords. The latter work, entirely wordless, contains some of the most difficult choral music in existence, according to Heseltine. After 1915, Delius turned his attention to traditional sonata, chamber and concerto forms, which he had largely left alone since his apprentice days. Of these pieces Payne highlights two: the Violin Concerto (1916), as an example of how, writing in unfamiliar genres, Delius remained stylistically true to himself; and the Cello Sonata of 1917, which, lacking the familiarity of an orchestral palate, becomes a melodic triumph. Cardus's verdict, however, is that Delius's chamber and concerto works are largely failures. After 1917, according to Payne, there was a general deterioration in {{the quantity and quality of}} Delius's output as illness took hold, although Payne exempts the incidental music to Hassan (1920–23) from condemnation, believing it to contain some of Delius's best work.|$|E

5|$|George R. R. Martin {{was already}} a {{successful}} fantasy and sci-fi author and TV writer before writing his <b>A</b> <b>Song</b> <b>of</b> Ice and Fire book series. Martin had published his first short story in 1971 and his first novel in 1977. By the mid-1990s, he had won three Hugo Awards, two Nebula Awards, and other awards for his short fiction. Although his early books were well received within the fantasy fiction community, his readership remained relatively small and Martin took on jobs as a writer in Hollywood in the mid-1980s. He worked principally on the revival of The Twilight Zone throughout 1986 and on Beauty and the Beast until 1990, but he also developed his own TV pilots and wrote feature film scripts. He grew frustrated that his pilots and screenplays were not getting made and that TV-related production limitations like budgets and episode lengths were forcing him to cut characters and trim battle scenes. This pushed Martin back towards writing books, where {{he did not have}} to worry about compromising the size of his imagination. Admiring the works of J. R. R. Tolkien in his childhood, he wanted to write an epic fantasy, though he did not have any specific ideas.|$|E

By his late teens, Peart had played in local bands such as Mumblin’ Sumpthin’, the Majority, and JR Flood. These bands practiced in basement recreation rooms and garages and played church halls, high schools and roller rinks in towns across Southern Ontario such as Mitchell, Seaforth, and Elmira. They also played in the northern Ontario city of Timmins. Tuesday nights were filled with jam sessions at the Niagara Theatre Centre.|$|E
