2500|$|Critics of {{polygamy}} in {{the early}} LDS Church have documented several cases where deception and coercion were used to induce marriage; for example, the case of Joseph Smith warning some potential spouses of eternal damnation {{if they did not}} consent to be his wife is often cited as an example.

Ann Eliza Young, nineteenth wife of Brigham Young, claimed that Young coerced her to marry him by threatening financial ruin of her brother. [...] However, LDS scholar Hugh Nibley disputed this claim, arguing that Ann Eliza <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> sought the marriage.|$|E
