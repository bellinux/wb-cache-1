40|$|The {{automation}} of synoptic and aviation weather observations is {{a global}} trend. In planning the transition from manual observations by human observers {{to the use of}} instrumented readings, either as an aid to or as a replacement of manual observations, the representativeness of instrumented readings vis-à-vis those of human observers and the assurance of continuity of the climatological records are two major challenges that need to be addressed. These challenges were dealt with in the introduction of instruments for visibility observations at the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) {{in the past several years}}. HKIA is located in a coastal environment with complex terrain in the vicinity. Apart from being an <b>aeronautical</b> <b>meteorological</b> station for issuing METARs in support of civil aviation, the airport <b>meteorological</b> <b>office</b> at HKIA also serves as the SYNOP station in Hong Kong. A dense network of six forward scatterers was installed along the two runways in HKIA in 2002 and the readings have been operationally used for both METAR and SYNOP reporting since late 2004. A study of the data in the past several years showed that the readings from these six sensors could sometimes be affected by localized events (e. g. fog patches). As it is necessary to report...|$|R
