40|$|A spontaneously {{transformed}} clone {{was isolated}} from repeatedly passaged BALB/c 3 T 3 cells. The transformed cells were rounded or slender and elongated, were randomly arranged in an overlapping pattern, grew to high cell density, {{and had a}} low requirement for serum. The rates of multiplication and DNA synthesis of the nontransformed and the transformed lines were reduced for several days by drastic reduction in the Mg 2 + concentration of the medium, but the rate of DNA synthesis in the Mg 2 +-deprived cultured increased after 6 [...] 8 days, suggesting an adaptation of the cells or a change in local environment. When maintained in very low Mg 2 + concentrations the transformed cells assumed the appearance and arrangement of nontransformed cells within 1 day. The rate of DNA synthesis in the transformed cultures in 1. 0 mM Mg 2 + was independent of serum concentration. After 3 days of Mg 2 + deprivation, however, the rate of DNA synthesis became highly dependent on both serum concentration and population density, thus resembling the growth behavior of nontransformed cells. Neither deprivation of K+ or Ca 2 + nor addition of dibutyryl cyclic AMP produced these effects. The Mg 2 + contents of nontransformed and transformed cells in physiological concentrations of Mg 2 + were similar and only slightly reduced by incubation for 4 days in Mg 2 +-deficient medium. In 1. 0 mM Mg 2 +, the Ca 2 + content of the nontransformed cells was approximately 3 times {{higher than that of}} the transformed cells. After incubation in Mg 2 +-deficient medium, the Ca 2 + contents of both cells types increased; that of the transformed cells slightly exceeded that of the nontransformed cells in Mg 2 +-sufficient medium. The results show that Mg 2 +-deprived transformed cells closely resemble nontransformed cells in <b>appearance,</b> <b>requirement</b> for serum, response to cell population density, and Ca 2 + content. They also show that these parameters can be regulated coordinately by Mg 2 + and support the suggestion that a defect in regulation by Mg 2 + is a basic feature of the malignant transformation...|$|E

40|$|Workplace {{rules that}} deny {{fundamental}} aspects of personal autonomy are (in many states) {{and should be}} actionable invasions of privacy. Perhaps nowhere is the invasion more keenly felt than when an employer demands, under penalty of forfeiting one 2 ̆ 7 s livelihood, that one dress or alter one 2 ̆ 7 s physical appearance {{in a way that}} one finds offensive, degrading, inappropriate, or alien. Clothes and appearance are constitutive of how we see and feel about ourselves and how we construct ourselves {{for the rest of the}} world to see. Conventions of appearance for women and men, for racial, ethnic, and religious groups express and observe political and spiritual commitments that affect people at a deep psychological level. In this essay, I argue that the legal framework of autonomy privacy is a necessary supplement to the discrimination analysis that has dominated legal thinking for thirty-five years of challenges to workplace <b>appearance</b> <b>requirements.</b> Some <b>appearance</b> <b>requirements</b> should be legally suspect even when they do not discriminate on the basis of a protected status. A privacy analysis, in contrast to a discrimination analysis, is a legal theory that is available to anyone who is significantly oppressed by an unreasonable workplace dress code. Privacy analysis may thus be more resistant to charges of special treatment and the backlash that such charges can generate. From the employer 2 ̆ 7 s standpoint, privacy analysis allows more flexibility and nuance in distinguishing appearance regulations that are legal from those that are not. It might, for example, preserve the ability of an employer to require some dress conventions, including some that may reflect gender, religious, and other norms, while ruling out others. A privacy analysis would help courts distinguish between dress codes that humiliate and those that do not, as well as help a court understand that a dress code can be generally valid but cannot be enforced against a particular employee who might find a particular dress requirement exceptionally humiliating or offensive. Wholly apart from the effects of a privacy analysis on the outcome of litigation, I think it will also prompt a more thoughtful analysis by firms of whether or how they should attempt formally to regulate employee appearance and how to handle the employee who objects. A privacy analysis will prompt an employer to consider the strength of its justification for its policy, the degree of humiliation it will affect on particular workers, and whether the harm is necessary to achieve the benefit. A discrimination analysis, by contrast, invites an employer to adopt even a silly appearance regulation (e. g., women must wear make-up and nail polish) if the employer can convince itself that the regulation is not sex discrimination because it equally burdens men or because only certain women will object. Privacy analysis will thus better identify and accommodate the employer 2 ̆ 7 s interest in the appearance of its workforce with interests of various employees in being free from humiliating workplace requirements...|$|R

This study aimed to explore which symptoms predict chronic dysphoria, a hallmark of depression. Methods 1057 participants from the population-based Young Finns study were examined for four times during a 16 -year period. Those with a modified Beck’s Depression Inventory score in the upper third at all four screenings were considered to have chronic dysphoria (n= 135). Participants with only one high depression score formed the reference group of transient dysphoria (n= 179). Individual items of the Inventory were analyzed in terms of their association with dysphoria status and chronicity, controlling for potential confounding factors, such as personality assessed using the Temperament and Character Inventory. ResultsBody-image dissatisfaction was strongly associated with chronically elevated dysphoria (Bonferroni-corrected p= 0. 006). The degree of body-image dissatisfaction was associated with the probability for chronic dysphoria in a dose–response manner, with the estimated probability ranging from 0. 01 to 0. 60 as a function of item response.
