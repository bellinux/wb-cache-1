You're the last man I ever expected to hear that kind of flapdoodle from. If it's because your bank has got some other interest and you can't advise me, why don't you say so?" [...] Nevertheless, in spite of Stacy's abrupt disclaimer, he left a few minutes later, half convinced that Stacy's lukewarmness was due to some adverse influence. Other callers were almost as quickly disposed of, {{and at the end}} of an hour Stacy found himself again alone.|$|E

5000|$|AAS use {{in sports}} began in October 1954 when John Ziegler, {{a doctor who}} treated American athletes, went to Vienna with the American weightlifting team. There he met a Russian {{physician}} who, over [...] "a few drinks", repeatedly asked [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>giving</b> your boys?" [...] When Ziegler returned the question, the Russian said that his own athletes were being given testosterone. Returning to America, Ziegler tried low doses of testosterone on himself, on the American trainer Bob Hoffman and on two lifters, Jim Park and Yaz Kuzahara. All gained more weight and strength than any training programme would produce but there were side-effects. Ziegler sought a drug without after-effects and hit on an anabolic steroid, methandrostenolone, (Dianabol, DBOL), made in the US in 1958 by Ciba.|$|E

5000|$|In October 1954, Ziegler, went to Vienna {{with the}} American weightlifting team. There {{he met a}} Russian {{physicist}} who, over [...] "a few drinks", repeatedly asked [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>giving</b> your boys?" [...] When Ziegler returned the question, the Russian said that his own athletes were being given testosterone. Returning to America, Ziegler tried weak doses of testosterone on himself, on the American trainer Bob Hoffman and on three lifters, John Grimek, Jim Park and Yaz Kuzahara. All gained more weight and strength than any training programme would produce, but there were side-effects. With the research assistance of Ciba Pharmaceuticals, Ziegler began to look for synthetic substance that would mimic testosterone. Working at CIBA allowed Ziegler access to books and records from Germany where experiments with testosterone had been {{carried out by the}} Nazis, and which had been confiscated by the United States after the war. Ziegler sought a drug without after-effects and hit on an anabolic steroid, methandrostenolone (Dianabol, DBOL), made in the U.S. in 1958 by Ciba.|$|E
5000|$|The credits (accompanied by organ music {{endemic to}} silent films), segue into title card: [...] "A city street-----where {{laughter}} and tragedy rub elbows." [...] A crowded block lined with tenement buildings, on Manhattan's Lower East Side, comes into view, {{followed by a}} look into the hallway {{of one of those}} buildings, then a shot is heard, a door to one of the apartments opens and a man holding a gun (Paul Muni) backs out, closes the door, puts the gun in his pocket, then walks down flights of stairs and into the busy street. While he passes along sidewalks teeming with human activity, an Irish American policeman berates a driver for parking in front of a hydrant, but when the driver removes his scarf, revealing a clerical collar, the abashed officer apologizes and offers to accompany the priest to the beat of [...] "that cop on the next corner, he's not one of us". At that point, the shooter approaches and makes a gesture to speak, but the priest has already started to drive off, with the officer standing on the car's running board. Continuing to walk, the shooter reaches a police precinct and goes inside. Approaching the desk lieutenant (Clifford Dempsey), who asks, [...] "Well, what's on your mind?", he replies, [...] "I killed a man", explaining that the victim lived at 191 East 8th Street, was named John Harris, and [...] "deserved to die". Asked for his own name, he hesitates and, spotting a wall calendar (showing May 1928) with a large ad for [...] "Dyke & Co., Inc.", says [...] "Dyke... James Dyke".

40|$|This {{publication}} helps adults {{develop a}} strategy to help teens {{learn how to make}} good decisions. Today 2 ̆ 7 s youth are put into situations where they must make important, often split-second decisions about things like cigarette or alcohol use, breaking laws, or whether to join in activities that are hurtful - or helpful and respectful - of others. We all hope that our youth will not hesitate {{to do the right thing}} in these situations. Adults can help prepare youth to make good, healthy choices. Kids and teens learn best through practice, so give youth chances to practice making decisions under your guidance. Start by giving kids responsibility for making choices on matters that involve little or no risk, such as how to style their hair, hobbies, etc. As youth grow, they are capable of taking responsibility for decisions on more important matters. Even preteens will benefit from the experience of working through some tough decisions on their own. Parents should step in if a decision involves serious risk, but otherwise, it is important to let youth take responsibility and experience the consequences, both good and bad, of their choices. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>giving</b> youth chances to practice making decisions on their own? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>giving</b> your youth too much responsibility or freedom before he or she is ready for it? This activity may help you think about these issues...|$|E
