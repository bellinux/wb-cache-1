The episode ranked {{one of the}} lowest in the 9:00PM timeslot, behind The Amazing Race on CBS, Sunday Night Football on NBC, <b>and</b> <b>Desperate</b> Housewives; however, it was ahead of fellow Fox animated sitcom American Dad!, which was shown immediately after Family Guy.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{pamphlet}} describes the pitiable <b>and</b> <b>desperate</b> {{conditions in which}} prostitutes lived, and {{the corruption of the}} police supposed to be patrol them, it also accuses prostitutes of 'Inhumanity' and deems them devilish and monstrous.

The episode also acquired a 4.4 rating in the 18–49 demographic, beating The Simpsons, The Cleveland Show and American Dad!, but was ultimately edged out slightly by The Simpsons in total viewership.|$|E

5|$|Before long, Chadwick gave Rotblat a {{fellowship}} (the Oliver Lodge Fellowship), doubling his income, {{and in that}} summer of 1939 the young Pole returned home, intending to bring Tola back with him. When {{the time came to}} leave Warsaw in late August, however, she was ill following an operation for appendicitis, and remained behind, expecting to follow within days; but the outbreak of war brought calamity. Tola was trapped, <b>and</b> <b>desperate</b> efforts in the ensuing months to bring her out through Denmark (with the help of Niels Bohr), Belgium, and finally Italy came to nothing, as each country in turn was closed off by the war. He never saw her again; she died in the Holocaust at the Belzec concentration camp. This affected him deeply {{for the rest of his}} life, and he never remarried.|$|E
5|$|Droits de l'Homme was irreparably damaged, {{and many}} of the men on board were {{soldiers}} with no training for what to do {{in the event of a}} shipwreck. Each successive wave swept more men into the water <b>and</b> <b>desperate</b> attempts to launch boats failed when the small craft were swept away by the waves and broken in the surf. Rafts were constructed, but several were swamped in attempts to carry a rope to the shore. The men on the one raft that remained upright were forced to cut the rope to prevent them from foundering in the heavy seas. Some of the men on this raft reached the beach, the first survivors of the wreck. Subsequent attempts were made by individuals to swim to shore with ropes, but they were either drowned or driven back to the ship by the force of the sea.|$|E
5|$|On 28 April, Tan Son Nhut Air Base (lying {{adjacent}} to the airport) came under artillery fire and attack from Vietnamese People's Air Force aircraft. The fixed-wing evacuation was terminated and Operation Frequent Wind commenced. The evacuation took place primarily from the Defense Attaché Office (DAO) compound, beginning around 14:00 {{on the afternoon of}} 29 April, and ending that night with only limited small arms damage to the helicopters. The U.S. Embassy in Saigon was intended to only be a secondary evacuation point for embassy staff, but it was soon overwhelmed with evacuees <b>and</b> <b>desperate</b> South Vietnamese. The evacuation of the embassy was completed at 07:53 on 30 April, but some Americans chose to stay or were left behind and some 400 third country nationals were left at the embassy.|$|E

5|$|The version by Aiken {{is perhaps}} the best known stage adaptation, {{released}} {{just a few months}} after the novel was published. This six-act behemoth also set an important precedent by being the first show on Broadway to stand on its own, without the performance of other entertainments or any afterpiece. Most of Aiken's dialogue is lifted verbatim from Stowe's novel and it included four full musical numbers written by the producer, George C. Howard. Another legacy of this adaptation is its reliance upon very different locations all portrayed on the same stage. This reliance led to large sets and set a precedent for the future days of film. By focusing on the stark <b>and</b> <b>desperate</b> situations of his characters, Aiken appealed to the emotions of his audiences. By combining this melodramatic approach with the content of Stowe's novel, Aiken helped to create a powerful visual indictment against the institution of slavery.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the battle, the fighting around Isurava has come to form {{a key part of}} the Australian narrative of the campaign. The Japanese were victorious in capturing Isurava, but Australian accounts in the early years after the war characterised the battle as a successful delaying action by a heavily outnumbered force that inflicted more casualties than it sustained, highlighting the bravery of Australian troops in an epic <b>and</b> <b>desperate</b> action of national survival. In this regard, the Battle of Isurava has come to form {{a key part of the}} Anzac legend, although recent accounts have re-examined the battle. As the size of the Japanese force committed to the fighting has been re-evaluated, the magnitude of the Australian defensive feat has also been reinterpreted. Recent analysis, while acknowledging the individual bravery of both Australian and Japanese soldiers, highlights tactical deficiencies on both sides, and now characterises the battle as one in which Australian forces were able to withdraw largely due to tactical errors from the Japanese commanders.|$|E
5|$|Within {{minutes of}} the British attack, Ceylon {{surrendered}} and boats from Magicienne sought but failed to take possession of her. The French crew drove the captured East Indiaman on shore, joined shortly afterwards by Minerve, Bellone and later by Victor, so that by 6:30 pm the entire French force was grounded and all but Bellone prevented from firing their main broadsides by beached ships blocking their arc of fire. Bellone however was ideally positioned to maintain her fire on Nereide from her beached position, and at 7:00 pm a cannon shot cut Nereides stern anchor cable. The British frigate swung around, presenting her stern to Bellone and pulling both her broadsides away from the French squadron. Raked by Bellone <b>and</b> <b>desperate</b> to return fire, Willoughby had the bow anchor cable cut, bringing {{a portion of his}} ship's starboard broadside to bear on Bellone. At 8:00 pm, Duperré was seriously wounded in the cheek by shrapnel from a grape shot fired by Nereide; Ensign Vigoureux concealed his unconscious body under a signal flag and discreetly brought him below decks while Bouvet assumed command of the French squadron on board Bellone, placing Lieutenant Albin Roussin in charge of Minerve. Building an improvised bridge between the French ships and the shore, Bouvet increased the men and ammunition reaching Bellone and thus significantly increased her rate of fire. He also had the rail removed between the foredeck and the quarterdeck of Minerve, and had iron hooks nailed to the freeboard below the starboard gangway as to provide attachment points for additional guns, thus building a continuous second deck on his frigate where he constituted a complete second battery. By 10:00 pm Nereide was a wreck, receiving shot from several sides, with most of her guns dismounted and casualties mounting to over 200: the first lieutenant was dying, the second was severely wounded and Willoughby's left eye had been dislodged from its socket by a wooden splinter. Recognising her battered state, Bouvet then diverted fire from Nereide to concentrate on Magicienne.|$|E
