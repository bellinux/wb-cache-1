He milled and drilled the handles from aluminum stock; the knife's blade was a simple steel blank that he hand cut with a hacksaw, shaped with files, and heat treated at his dining room table with a butane torch.|$|E
5|$|Home Made Mince Pie is a 1910 American silent short comedy {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film is a comedy of circumstances, in which the Gale family is going to host a dinner. The focus of the humor is in a mince pie that brandy is added to in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it more appreciable, but three people each add brandy to the pie. Everyone becomes tipsy upon eating the pie, including the family cat, and the film concludes. No cast or staff credits for this film are known. The film was released on September 27, 1910, to mixed reviews in trade publications. Reviewers mentioned that the film was too long and it was unbelievable that one pie split eight ways {{would be able to}} impact everyone. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 Wałęsa quit Solidarity {{in protest}} of the union's support of the ruling right-wing Law and Justice party, and Lech and Jarosław Kaczyński—twin {{brothers}} who had been prominent in Solidarity and were now serving as the country’s president and prime minister, respectively. The main point of disagreement was the Kaczyńskis’ focus on rooting out {{those who had been}} involved in communist rule and their party's <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> public all the files of the former communist secret police. Until then only members of the government and parliament had to declare any connection with the former security services. Wałęsa and his supporters argued the so-called transparency legislation advocated by the government might turn into a witch hunt and the more than 500,000 Poles who had possibly collaborated with the communist secret police could face exposure.|$|E

5|$|The first sixteen {{issues of}} Unknown had cover paintings, but from July 1940 the cover style {{was changed to}} a table of contents, with a small ink drawing usually {{accompanying}} the summary of each story, in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the magazine appear more dignified. The cover art came almost entirely from artists who did not contribute to many science fiction or fantasy magazines: six of the sixteen paintings were by H. W. Scott; Manuel Islip, Modest Stein, Graves Gladney, and Edd Cartier provided the others. Cartier {{was the only one}} of these who regularly contributed to sf and fantasy periodicals; he painted four of Unknowns last six covers before the change to a text-heavy design.|$|E
