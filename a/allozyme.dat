5|$|Like {{most other}} members of its genus, the phylogenetic {{position}} of the blacktip reef shark remains indeterminate. Based on morphology, Jack Garrick proposed in 1982 that the closest relative of the blacktip reef shark was the nervous shark (C.cautus). Leonard Compagno's 1988 morphological analysis suggested affinity not only between this species and the nervous shark, but also four other species, and could not resolve their relationships further. A 1998 <b>allozyme</b> analysis by Gavin Naylor again yielded ambiguous results, finding that the blacktip reef shark forms a polytomy (irresolvable group) with 10 other Carcharhinus species.|$|E

5|$|After Whitley's initial description, C. tilstoni was {{generally}} regarded as synonymous with C. limbatus, the common blacktip shark. In the 1980s, additional morphological and life history data again favored the recognition of C. tilstoni as a separate species, which was eventually confirmed by <b>allozyme</b> studies performed by Shane Lavery and James Shaklee. Several molecular phylogenetic studies based on allozymes, mitochondrial DNA, and nuclear DNA {{have found that the}} Australian and common blacktip sharks form a closely related clade with the graceful shark (C. amblyrhynchoides) and the smoothtooth blacktip shark (C. leiodon).

5|$|As is {{the case}} for most Carcharhinus species, {{attempts}} to analyze the finetooth shark's phylogenetic relationships have yielded variable results. In 1988, Leonard Compagno grouped this species with the spinner shark (C. brevipinna), blacktip shark (C. limbatus), graceful shark (C. amblyrhynchoides), and smooth tooth blacktip shark (C. leiodon), on the basis of morphological characters. Gavin Naylor's 1992 <b>allozyme</b> analysis found that the finetooth shark is the second-most basal member of the genus next to the blacknose shark (C. acronotus). Mine Dosay-Akbulut's 2008 study, based on ribosomal DNA, suggested that the closest relative of the finetooth shark is the smalltail shark (C. porosus), and that the two species form a clade apart from other Carcharhinus species.|$|E

Electrophoretic mobilities of outer membrane proteins (OMP) were also studied for strains belonging to O 4, O 6, O 7, O 8 and O 75 serogroups. Fast migrating <b>allozymes</b> of carboxylesterase B (pattern B 1) were correlated with slow migrating <b>allozymes</b> of esterase C, serogroups O 7 and O 8, lack of virulence factor, and particular OMP patterns, whereas slow migrating <b>allozymes</b> of carboxylesterase B (pattern B 2) were correlated with fast migrating <b>allozymes</b> of esterase C, serogroups O 2, O 4, O 6, O 18 and O 75, virulence factor production, and distinct OMP patterns. <b>Allozymes</b> of esterases A and I were not clearly correlated with the distribution of virulence factors.

40|$|We {{have used}} gluconate-limited chemostats to study {{selective}} differences between isogenic strains of Escherichia coli K 12 into which four naturally occurring alleles coding for <b>allozymes</b> of 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6 PGD) had been transferred. The limit of detectability of selection with our procedures is a selection coefficient of 0. 5 %. In the normal E. coli K 12 genetic background, all alleles are selectively neutral or nearly neutral. The absence of detectable selection does, however, depend on genetic background and on such environmental factors as cell density. In a genetic background containing a mutation that cuts off the alternative metabolic route for 6 -phosphogluconate, selection between <b>allozymes</b> can be detected, and the selection {{is in the}} direction expected from the measured apparent Km values of the <b>allozymes.</b> Even when the alternative metabolic route is not blocked by mutation, one of the 6 PGD <b>allozymes</b> has a detrimental, but density-dependent, interaction with a mutation conferring resistance to bacteriophage T 5. In all cases, the observed selection {{is due to the}} <b>allozymes</b> themselves (or to associated regulatory elements), as the selection disappears when the chemostats are limited by a different carbon source (ribose plus succinate). Nevertheless, the four alleles do seem to be selectively neutral or nearly neutral in the normal E. coli K 12 genetic background. Moreover, the distribution of allele frequencies in natural populations of E. coli is in accord with the expectations of selective neutrality...|$|R
5|$|Based on {{morphological}} similarities, Jack Garrick in 1982 grouped {{this species}} with the bignose shark (C. altimus) and the sandbar shark (C. plumbeus), while Leonard Compagno in 1988 placed {{it as the}} sister species of the grey reef shark (C. amblyrhynchos). A phylogenetic analysis based on <b>allozyme</b> data, published by Gavin Naylor in 1992, indicated that the Caribbean reef shark is the sister taxon to a clade formed by the Galapagos shark (C. galapagensis), dusky shark (C. obscurus), oceanic whitetip shark (C. longimanus), and the blue shark (Prionace glauca).

5|$|Based on {{similarities}} in morphology, tooth shape, and behavior, the closest {{relatives of the}} spinner shark were originally {{believed to be the}} blacktip shark and the graceful shark (C. amblyrhynchoides). However, this interpretation was not supported by Gavin Naylor's 1992 <b>allozyme</b> analysis, which suggested that these similarities are the product of convergent evolution and that the closest relative of the spinner shark is the copper shark (C. brachyurus). In a 2007 ribosomal DNA study, the spinner shark was found to be the most genetically divergent of all the requiem shark species examined save for the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier), being less related to other Carcharhinus species than the lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris).|$|E
5|$|In older literature, the {{scientific}} {{name of this}} species was often given as C. menisorrah. The blacktail reef shark (C. wheeleri), native to the western Indian Ocean, is now regarded as the same species as the grey reef shark by most authors. It was originally distinguished from the grey reef shark by a white tip on the first dorsal fin, a shorter snout, and one fewer upper tooth row on each side. Based on morphological characters, vertebral counts, and tooth shapes, Garrick (1982) concluded the grey reef shark is most {{closely related to the}} silvertip shark (C. albimarginatus).

40|$|Phosphoglucose {{isomerase}} (PGI) <b>allozymes</b> {{were isolated}} from the wing-polymorphic water strider, Lirnnoporus canaliculatus, and were characterized biochemically with respect to temperature-dependent kinetic and thermostability properties. At higher temperatures, the <b>allozymes</b> exhibited significant differences in Michaelis constant (Km) values for substrates of both the forward and reverse reaction directions. Results were consistent with expectations of adaptive kinetic differentiation based on the latitudinal variation of PGI allele frequencies. PGI genotypes also differed with regard to maximal velocity (Vmax) /Km ratios at higher temperatures. These differences were due primarily, if not exclusively, to allozyme-dependent variation in Km values. The <b>allozymes</b> also exhibited dramatic differences in thermostability. However, no thermostability differences were observed when the substrate analogue 6 -phosphogluconate was present in the incubation medium. The data from this study, together with data from Mytilus edulis and Metridium senile on temperature-dependent kinetic variation among PGI <b>allozymes,</b> form a consistent picture of natural selection influencing the clinal variation of alleles at this locus in these three phylogenetically distant organisms. More definitive support of this hypothesis, however, must await additional studies on the physiological effects of the allozymic variation as well as direct measurements of fitness differences among the enzyme genotypes...|$|R
5|$|More recently, Gavin Naylor's 1992 phylogenetic analysis, {{based on}} <b>allozyme</b> {{sequence}} data, {{found that the}} silky shark {{is part of a}} group containing large sharks with a ridge between the dorsal fins.

This showed that it was not descended to A.pinnatifidum, whose chromatograms contain compounds inherited from walking fern (A.rhizophyllum), and verified that A.stotleri was simply a form of A.bradleyi. <b>Allozyme</b> analysis in the 1980s also supported these hybrid origins of A.bradleyi.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{morphological}} data, Jack Garrick {{suggested in}} 1982 that the blacknose shark has a sister relationship {{to a group}} containing the whitecheek shark (C. dussumieri) and the blackspot shark (C. sealei), while Leonard Compagno proposed in 1988 that this shark belongs in a group with five other species, including the silky shark (C. falciformis) and the blacktip reef shark (C. melanopterus). Molecular analyses have been similarly equivocal regarding the blacknose shark's phylogenetic relationships: Gavin Naylor's 1992 <b>allozyme</b> analysis found this species {{to be the most}} basal member of Carcharhinus, while Mine Dosay-Abkulut's 2008 ribosomal DNA analysis indicated affinity between it and the blacktip shark (C. limbatus) or the smalltail shark (C. porosus). The whitenose shark (Nasolamia velox), found along the tropical western coast of the Americas, may be descended from blacknose sharks that experienced the teratogenic effects of incipient cyclopia.|$|E
