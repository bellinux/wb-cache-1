5|$|Billy Clanton {{was shot}} in the wrist, chest and abdomen, and <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two slumped to a sitting {{position}} near his original position {{at the corner of the}} MacDonald house in the lot between the house and Fly's Lodging House. Claiborne said Clanton was supported by a window initially after he was shot, and fired some shots after sitting, with the pistol supported on his leg. After he ran out of ammunition, he called for more cartridges, but C. S. Fly took his pistol at about the time the general shooting ended.|$|E
5|$|The same {{cauldron}} {{was used}} as in the 1932 Summer Games. The orchestra played The Olympian composed and conducted by Philip Glass. The torch enters the stadium carried by Rafer Johnson, he completes a lap as mechanical steps rise {{from the center of}} the peristalses. He climbs the stairs and stands and faces the crowd as The Olympian is still being played. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> he lights the gas powered Olympic rings that connect with the Olympic cauldron. The flame is lit to the cheers from the crowd. The athlete and judges oaths are taken and a children's chorus appears. They perform ode to joy.|$|E
5|$|The spacewalk {{scene on}} the Enterprise {{exterior}} {{was one of the}} most challenging sets to envision and construct for the film. The production had to design a space suit that looked practical rather than exaggerated. Fans were built into the helmets so that the actors would not get overheated, and neon lights built into the front so that the occupant's faces could be seen. When the actors first put the helmets on, the fully enclosed design made it hard to breathe; <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> of wearing the suit Stewart became ill, and shooting was discontinued. The set for the ship's outer hull and deflector dish were built on gimbals at Paramount's largest sound stage, surrounded by bluescreen and rigged with wires for the zero gravity sequences. The stage was not large enough to accommodate a full-sized replica of the Enterprise dish, so Zimmerman had to scale down the plans by 15percent.|$|E

5|$|Emma asks Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) {{about the}} compass and he {{searches}} his records. He finds {{a card that}} supposedly says Michael Tillman purchased the compass, and gives Emma this name. The card is revealed to be blank. Michael is the garage mechanic, and tells Emma he can barely handle the garage let alone twins. Emma {{has no choice but}} to take Ava and Nicholas to Boston on Regina's orders, despite Henry's warnings that no one can leave Storybrooke. That evening as the three are leaving, the vehicle breaks down as they reach the city limits, prompting Emma to call for help. Moments later, Ava notices her compass working. Michael arrives in his tow truck, and Emma explains that he at least has to see his children, as she could not leave Henry after seeing the life he had. Seeing Ava and Nicholas face to face changes his mind, and Michael accepts them into his life. Later, Emma shares Henry's theory with Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin), that she is Snow White's daughter and Mary Margaret is Snow White. Mary finds this laughable, but seeing Emma's blanket triggers some sort of reaction from her. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> however, she is quick to dismiss it as nothing.|$|E
25|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or so, a dark {{plume of}} smoke was {{observed}} {{rising from the}} wreckage. The fire was traced to a ruptured oil tank above the right engine. The leaking oil fell onto the hot engine and ignited. The fire was not fed by jet fuel.|$|E
25|$|Reductions {{employing}} {{an excess}} of alkali metals in ammonia or amines are extremely rapid and should be quenched <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or so of reaction time—longer reaction times promote side reactions. When lithium or sodium in ammonia is used, the persistence of a deep blue color in the solution (due to solvated electrons) {{is a sign that}} the reaction is complete. Reductions employing alkali metal arene radical anion complexes similarly require a large excess of the reducing agent, very low temperatures and short reaction times. Reductive desulfonylations and reductive eliminations employing alkali or alkaline earth metals in ammonia present a high fire hazard and should be conducted in a properly functioning chemical fume hood away from flammable solvents. Ammonia is a corrosive gas with a pungent odor. Alkali metals react violently with water or even moist air to generate hydrogen, which can then be ignited by the heat of the reaction.|$|E

25|$|Tyson {{attacked}} Spinks {{from the}} opening bell, landing a solid left hook in the first ten seconds and forcing Spinks to cover up. Spinks clinched and was driven back to the ropes by another Tyson attack. He moved off the ropes but Tyson trapped him again; a left uppercut and a right hand to the body forced Spinks to take a knee <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> which marked the second time Spinks had been knocked down in his professional career since Braxton during the eighth round of their 1983 encounter. Spinks took a count of four before rising. As the two men moved towards each other Tyson turned away from a Spinks right hand and responded with a left-right combination to the head which put Spinks down again. This time {{he was unable to}} rise and referee Frank Cappuccino counted him out. The fight was over after 91 seconds, presently the sixth shortest heavyweight title fight in history. Just ten punches were landed, eight by Tyson, two by Spinks. The round was named round of the year for 1988 by Ring Magazine.|$|E
500|$|Alice was {{too much}} puzzled to say {{anything}}, so <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> Humpty Dumpty began again. [...] "They've a temper, some of them—particularly verbs, they're the proudest—adjectives {{you can do anything}} with, but not verbs—however, I can manage the whole lot! Impenetrability! That's what I say!" ...|$|E
500|$|Cambridge won the toss {{and elected}} {{to start from}} the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex {{side of the river}} to Oxford. [...] Drinkwater {{described}} the conditions as [...] "perfect" [...] and umpire Pitman started the race at 12:38p.m. [...] Both crews made strong starts but Oxford edged ahead and held a third of a length lead <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> which they extended to a half-length after two minutes. [...] The Cambridge stroke Stuart kept the Light Blue stroke rate high round the bend to the Mile Post and his counterpart Bourne allowed them to draw level by Harrods Furniture Depository.|$|E

500|$|Oxford won the toss {{and elected}} {{to start from}} the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex {{side of the river}} to Cambridge. [...] In an [...] "unpleasant drizzle", the umpire Burnell started the race at 12:30p.m. [...] The Light Blues made a [...] "smoother start" [...] but were {{marginally}} out-rated by Oxford who held a one-third length lead <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> [...] They extended their lead to two-thirds of a length by Craven Steps but the bend in the river favoured Cambridge, and their lead was halved. [...] By the Mile Post, the Dark Blues led by the length of a canvas.|$|E
500|$|Cambridge won the toss {{and elected}} {{to start from}} the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex {{side of the river}} to Oxford. [...] In a south-easterly wind and drizzle, the race was started by umpire Kenneth Payne at 11:30a.m. [...] Oxford out-rated their {{opposition}} for the first minute, averaging 40 strokes per minute to Cambridge's 37, yet <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> the Light Blues held a half-length lead. [...] With the Dark Blues continuing to stroke faster, the deficit was reduced to a quarter-length by Craven Steps, which was passed in record time. By the Mile Post, and despite pushes from Oxford, the Light Blues were about half a length ahead.|$|E
500|$|Oxford won the toss {{and elected}} {{to start from}} the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex {{side of the river}} to Cambridge. [...] Umpire Pitman started the race in calm {{conditions}} at 5:10p.m. [...] Apparently disrupted by the wake of a nearby moored steamer, Oxford's start was poor, allowing Cambridge to lead by a canvas' length <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> [...] Despite this, Oxford had drawn level a minute later, to hold a small lead by the time the crews commenced the long bend. [...] By the Mile Post, the Dark Blues held a quarter-length lead and by Hammersmith Bridge had extended this to three-quarters of a length. [...] Spurting at The Doves pub, Oxford began to draw clear of Cambridge.|$|E
6000|$|... 'They {{hold their}} own,' Charley said <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute's</b> silence; 'there is no fear. Lopez!' he shouted, 'run {{and see that}} the outside {{as well as the}} inside gates are open.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I {{will accept}} your letter, then,' said Fairford, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute's</b> consideration, 'and the thanks you expect shall be most liberally paid, if the result answer what you {{teach me to}} expect.' ...|$|R
500|$|Oxford were {{considered}} clear pre-race favourites {{to win their}} first Boat Race in five years; conditions were inclement with a [...] "nasty north-west wind" [...] but a [...] "fair tide". [...] They lost the toss and Cambridge elected to start from the Middlesex station, handing Oxford the Surrey side of the river. [...] The race commenced at 1:13p.m., and Cambridge made the better start, taking the lead from the outset with a higher stroke rate. [...] Half a length ahead <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> the Light Blues nearly had a clear water advantage but tired in the strong headwind, and started to be caught by Craven Steps, around [...] along the course. About a mile into the race, one of the Cambridge crew broke a slide.|$|E
500|$|Oxford won the toss {{and elected}} {{to start from}} the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex {{side of the river}} to Cambridge. [...] Umpire Payne started the race at 12:30p.m., with the Dark Blues making a {{slightly}} faster start; <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> they were about a canvas-length ahead of their opponents. [...] Although having the outside of the first bend, they had extended their lead to a quarter of a length by Craven Cottage. [...] By the time the crews passed the Mile Post, Cambridge were leading by a quarter-length which they extended to half a length by Harrods Furniture Depository. [...] Cambridge's stroke Crick increased his crew's rate; [...] his opposite number Cavenagh responded to prevent the Light Blues going clear.|$|E
500|$|Oxford {{started from}} the Surrey station and despite rating higher, were {{slightly}} behind Cambridge <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> [...] Aggressive steering from Hobson resulted in warnings from umpire Mike Sweeney, {{and by the}} mile post, Oxford held a two-second lead. [...] A push by Oxford at Harrods saw them five seconds clear by Hammersmith Bridge and two lengths clear by Chiswick Steps. [...] Nine seconds ahead by Barnes Bridge, Oxford passed the finishing post officially 12 seconds and three-and-three-quarter lengths ahead of Cambridge, {{in a time of}} 16 minutes 45 seconds, beating the previous best of 16 minutes 58 seconds recorded by Oxford in the 1976 race. [...] This was Oxford's ninth consecutive victory, and their tenth in eleven years, and took the overall record to 6861 in favour of Cambridge.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{comes the}} epistle of James. Will you {{see whether it}} is longer than any that come after it?" [...] The boys, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute's</b> examination, answer, [...] "Yes sir," [...] "Yes sir." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell another story, Mother, {{one with}} a moral to it, like this. I {{like to think about}} them afterward, if they are real and not too preachy," [...] said Jo, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute's</b> silence.|$|R

500|$|The men's {{race was}} the 161st contest between OUBC and CUBC, and {{was held at}} 5:50p.m on 11 April 2015. [...] Prior to the race, the overall record in the event stood at 81–78 in Cambridge's favour, with one dead heat. [...] The Dark Blues went into the race as the [...] "strongest favourites {{in the history of}} the race". [...] Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex side of the river to Oxford. [...] Oxford made the better start and were quickly ahead, with a quarter-length lead <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> [...] Cambridge drew back into {{contention}} and held a canvas lead after two minutes where both crews were warned by Rankov as they closed. [...] Cambridge marginally out-rated the Dark Blues as Oxford took a slight lead and were one second ahead by the Mile Post. [...] Rankov issued further warnings as the crews passed beside Harrods Furniture Depository, Oxford half a length ahead, but with the Light Blues holding the advantage of the bend in the river as they approached Hammersmith Bridge.|$|E
500|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> Sirhan {{wrestled}} {{free and}} grabbed the revolver again, but he had already fired all the bullets and was subdued. [...] Barry went to Kennedy and laid his jacket under the candidate's head, later recalling: [...] "I knew immediately it was a [...]22, a small caliber, so I hoped it wouldn't be so bad, but then I saw {{the hole in the}} Senator's head, and I knew". Reporters and photographers rushed into the area from both directions, contributing to the confusion and chaos. As Kennedy lay wounded, Juan Romero cradled the senator's head and placed a rosary in his hand. Kennedy asked Romero, [...] "Is everybody OK?" [...] and Romero responded, [...] "Yes, everybody's OK." [...] Kennedy then turned away from Romero and said, [...] "Everything's going to be OK." [...] Captured by Life photographer Bill Eppridge and Boris Yaro of the Los Angeles Times, this moment became the iconic image of the assassination. There was some initial confusion in who was shot, one witness believing that the primary victim was Kennedy's campaign manager, Stephen Edward Smith. This was quickly realized to be untrue.|$|E
500|$|The {{first race}} in the {{build-up}} to The Boat Races for CUBC was against OBUBC on 29 January 2017 along two sections of the Championship Course. [...] The first race was from Putney Bridge to Chiswick Eyot; [...] OBUBC took an early lead before Cambridge led at Hammersmith. [...] A final push from OBUBC resulted in a drawn race. [...] The second race, from Chiswick Eyot to the University Post, was a one-sided affair with OBUBC leading from the start and gradually pulling away to win by two lengths. [...] Goldie also faced an Oxford Brookes crew over two pieces, losing them both. [...] Cambridge faced an Italian national crew on 18 March in two pieces on the Championship Course. [...] The first race saw the Italians make the better start, and despite steering off-course, they maintained their lead in rough weather under Hammersmith Bridge. [...] CUBC pushed hard but were unable to catch the Italians, losing by one quarter of a length. [...] The second piece was conducted in blustery conditions between Chiswick Eyot and Chiswick Bridge. [...] A close start saw both crews level <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> but the Light Blues pulled away after Barnes Bridge, and won by four lengths.|$|E
6000|$|The Archduke reddened, {{and fixed}} {{his eyes on}} the speaker, while the SPRUCH-SPRECHER answered, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute's</b> consideration, [...] "The Lord Marquis will pardon me--a lion cannot fly above an eagle, because no lion hath got wings." ...|$|R
