5|$|A low calorie diet extends median <b>and</b> <b>maximum</b> {{lifespan}} in many animals. This {{effect may}} involve {{a reduction in}} oxidative stress. While {{there is some evidence}} to support the role of oxidative stress in aging in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, the evidence in mammals is less clear. Indeed, a 2009 review of experiments in mice concluded that almost all manipulations of antioxidant systems had no effect on aging.|$|E
5|$|A {{qualitative}} {{justification for}} this extrapolation of his method {{has been suggested}} by Valluri, Wilson and Harper. According to their argument, Newton considered the apsidal precession angle α (the angle between the vectors of successive minimum <b>and</b> <b>maximum</b> distance from the center) to be a smooth, continuous function of the orbital eccentricity ε. For the inverse-square force, α equals 180°; the vectors to the positions of minimum <b>and</b> <b>maximum</b> distances lie on the same line. If α is initially not 180° at low ε (quasi-circular orbits) then, in general, α will equal 180° only for isolated values of ε; a randomly chosen value of ε would be very unlikely to give α = 180°. Therefore, the observed slow rotation of the apsides of planetary orbits suggest that {{the force of gravity}} is an inverse-square law.|$|E

5|$|Electricity {{distribution}} in the state {{as well in the}} Federal Territory of Labuan are operated and managed by the Sabah Electricity Sdn. Bhd. (SESB). Sabah electrics are mostly generated from diesel power plant, hydropower and combined cycle power plants. The only main hydroelectric plant is the Tenom Pangi Dam. The combined cycle power plant called Kimanis Power Plant was completed in 2014, supplying 300 MW, with 285 MW nominal capacity. The plant is a joint venture between Petronas and NRG Consortium that also includes facilities such as gas pipeline of Sabah–Sarawak Gas Pipeline and a terminal of Sabah Oil and Gas Terminal. There is another two combined cycle power plants with a capacity of 380 MW operated by Ranhill Holdings Berhad. In 2009, the electricity coverage covers 67% of the state population and by 2011 increase to 80%. The coverage reach 100% in 2012 after an allocation of RM962.5million from the federal government were given to expand the coverage under the 2012 National Budget. The electrical grid is divided into two of West Coast and East Coast which has been integrated since 2007. The West Coast Grid supplies electricity to Kota Kinabalu, Papar, Beaufort, Keningau, Kota Belud, Kota Marudu, Kudat and Labuan with a capacity of 488.4 MW <b>and</b> <b>maximum</b> demand of 396.5 MW.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigate}} the energy {{gap between the}} ground state and the first excited state in a model of two single-mode Bose-Einstein condensates coupled via Josephson tunneling.

Above this threshold point one minimum occurs close to the Josephson regime, and a set of minima <b>and</b> <b>maxima</b> appear in the Fock regime. Expressions for the position of these minima <b>and</b> <b>maxima</b> are obtained.

5|$|Immediately after {{becoming}} a tropical storm, {{the movement of}} Tanya became hindered by a nearby upper-level low, and it quickly turned eastward before virtually stalling early on October28.

Despite that, the storm gradually strengthened as it remained over warm waters of about 81°F (27°C).

5|$|On October14, a {{tropical}} depression was first observed over the western Caribbean Sea, {{just off the}} eastern Honduras coast. It was a large and weak tropical cyclone, moving slowly northwestward and gradually intensifying. On October15, it is estimated the depression attained tropical storm status, and its strengthening became more steady. The next day, the storm reached hurricane status about 130mi (215km) southeast of Cozumel, Quintana Roo. Around that time, it began to execute a small counterclockwise loop off {{the east coast of}} the Yucatán Peninsula. By October18 the hurricane completed the loop, during which its winds increased to 115mph (185km/h); this is the equivalence of a major hurricane, or a Category3 on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. The estimation of its strength at this point was based on subsequent analysis of peripheral recordings of atmospheric pressure <b>and</b> <b>maximum</b> sustained winds by ships and land stations.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAims. This study aims {{to improve}} our {{understanding}} of the occurrence and origin of grand solar <b>maxima</b> <b>and</b> minima. Methods. We first investigate the statistics of peaks and dips simultaneously occurring in the solar modulation potentials reconstructed using the Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP) 10 Be and IntCal 13 14 C records for the overlapping time period spanning between ~ 1650 AD to 6600 BC. Based on the distribution of these events, we propose a method to identify grand minima <b>and</b> <b>maxima</b> periods. By using waiting time distribution analysis, we investigate the nature of grand minima <b>and</b> <b>maxima</b> periods identified based on the criteria as well as the variance and significance of the Hale cycle during these kinds of events throughout the Holocene epoch. Results. Analysis of grand minima <b>and</b> <b>maxima</b> events occurring simultaneously in the solar modulation potentials, reconstructed based on the 14 C and the 10 Be records, shows that the majority of events characterized by periods of moderate activity levels tend to last less than 50 years: grand maxima periods do not last longer than 100 years, while grand minima can persist slightly longer. The power and the variance of the 22 -year Hale cycle increases during grand <b>maxima</b> <b>and</b> decreases during grand minima, compared to periods characterized by moderate activity levels. Conclusions. We present the first reconstruction of the occurrence of grand solar <b>maxima</b> <b>and</b> minima during the Holocene based on simultaneous changes in records of past solar variability derived from tree-ring 14 C and ice-core 10 Be, respectively. This robust determination of the occurrence of grand solar minima <b>and</b> <b>maxima</b> periods will enable systematic investigations of the influence of grand solar minima <b>and</b> <b>maxima</b> episodes on Earth’s climate...|$|R
