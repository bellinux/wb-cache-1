5|$|Throughout {{the summer}} of 2008, Obama {{typically}} led McCain in national polls by single-digit margins, and also led in several key swing states. McCain reprised his familiar underdog role, which was due {{at least in part}} to the overall challenges Republicans faced in the election year. McCain accepted public financing for the general election campaign, and the restrictions that go with it, while criticizing his Democratic opponent for becoming the first major party candidate to opt out of such financing for the general election since the system was implemented in 1976. The Republican's broad campaign theme focused on his experience and <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead,</b> compared to Obama's.|$|E

Soon afterward, Harrow was relieved of command and never again served in the Army of the Potomac, but he was soon reinstated in field command by his old friend, President Abraham Lincoln.|$|R
30|$|We base our {{hypotheses}} on {{the opposing}} effects of organizational pride in employees’ efforts and abilities on attribution theory (Weiner 1985). According to attribution theory, attributing {{positive and negative}} events <b>to</b> effort or <b>ability</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> different consequences, because effort and ability differ in terms of controllability and stability. Whereas efforts are regarded as instable and controllable, abilities are stable and uncontrollable (Weiner 1985). Thus, when events are attributed to efforts, individuals {{believe that they can}} influence them, whereas attributing events <b>to</b> <b>ability</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> perceiving them as beyond one’s influence (LePine and Van Dyne 2001).|$|R
25|$|New Testament {{passages}} that explicitly discuss prophets existing {{after the death}} and resurrection of Christ include Revelation 11:10, Matthew 10:40–41 and 23:34, John 13:20 and 15:20 and Acts 11:25–30, 13:1 and 15:32. Christians believe that the Holy Spirit leads people to faith in Jesus and gives them the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> a Christian life and to give gifts (i.e. abilities) to Christians. These may include the charismatic gifts such as prophecy, tongues, miraculous healing ability, and clairsentience. Christians holding a view known as cessationism believe these gifts were given only in New Testament times and ceased after the last apostle died.|$|E
25|$|Decatur {{supervised}} {{the construction of}} several U.S. naval vessels, one of which he later commanded. He is the youngest man to reach the rank of captain {{in the history of}} the United States Navy. He served under three presidents, and played a major role in the early development of the American navy. In almost every theater of operation, Decatur's service was characterized by acts of heroism and exceptional performance. His service in the Navy took him through both Barbary Wars in North Africa, the Quasi-War with France, and the War of 1812 with Britain. He was renowned for his natural <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> and for his genuine concern for the seamen under his command. His numerous naval victories against Britain, France and the Barbary states established the United States Navy as a rising power.|$|E
25|$|In January 2005, Villaraigosa {{appeared}} before {{a coalition of}} animal rights activists and pledged that, if elected, he would implement a no-kill policy for Animal Services and fire General Manager Guerdon Stuckey, an appointee of former Mayor Hahn. Animal activists had expressed doubts regarding Stuckey's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> the Department of Animal Service since his appointment, primarily citing his lack of experience. During Stuckey's tenure, activist concern intensified due to a refusal to accept charity-sponsored spay and neuter services, firings of several key animal rights-oriented workers, and excessive euthanasia of animals held by Animal Services. Approximately one year after Villaraigosa's initial promise to fire Stuckey and substantial negative press, Villaraigosa fired Stuckey. Stuckey appealed the firing to the City Council and threatened a lawsuit, and in February 2006, the Los Angeles City Council awarded Stuckey a $50,000 consulting fee with the agreement {{that there would be}} no lawsuit. In January 2006, Villaraigosa appointed Ed Boks to the General Manager position. In April 2009, General Manager Ed Boks resigned after complaints from some staff, city councillors, and animal advocates. In June 2010, fifteen months after Boks’ resignation, Brenda Barnette, former CEO of the Seattle Humane Society was appointed.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, having {{retreated to}} the island of Lobau after the battle of Aspern-Essling, Napoleon {{knew that he had}} failed in his attempt to cross the Danube and was so {{astonished}} by the severity of the setback that he remained in unaccustomed inaction for 36 hours. After recovering his usual drive, his immediate concern was to improve the dire situation of his army, which was in very bad shape and virtually trapped on Lobau island, after the Danube had swollen. With his usual tireless activity, he supervised the transformation of Lobau island into a huge army base. The French built temporary campaign hospitals for his 20,000 wounded, as well as warehouses and barracks, which sheltered a numerous permanent military garrison. As soon a secure bridge was built, the Emperor had the wounded and a part of the troops transferred to the mainland, but maintained IV Corps on the island. He did not intend to abandon this position, as he was planning {{to use it as a}} springboard for his upcoming crossing. His next task was to rebuild the army. Casualties had been roughly equal to those of the enemy, but, with fewer troops engaged, some of Napoleon's battalions needed rebuilding from scratch. Losses in officers in particular had been extremely high and proved difficult to replace. Maréchal Jean Lannes, one of Napoleon's ablest commanders and a personal friend, had been mortally wounded in action and died nine days after the battle. Another irreplaceable loss was Louis-Vincent-Joseph Le Blond de Saint-Hilaire, who had been created a Marshal of the Empire just a month before, in recognition of his brilliant conduct during the earlier campaign, but received a mortal wound during the battle and died before the coveted baton could arrive from Paris. Jean-Louis-Brigitte Espagne, another famous general was killed in action at the head of his cuirassiers and the commander in chief of the artillery, Nicolas-Marie Songis des Courbons, became severely ill and had to leave his command a few weeks after the battle. Despite all these setbacks, the army and its officers retained total confidence in Napoleon's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> them to victory and morale remained high. Evidence of this came a couple of days before the newly planned crossing of the Danube, when Napoleon's most senior Corps commander, Maréchal André Masséna fell from his horse and badly injured his foot, rendering him unable to ride for some time. In sheer contrast with Hiller's gesture, Masséna, although in significant pain, made arrangements to lead his men in battle from a phaeton and vowed to retain his command, much to the Emperor's relief.|$|E

500|$|The Baird {{nomination}} was emblematic of other difficulties Clinton had {{during the transition}} period and his early days in office, including most prominently the dropping of a promised middle-class tax cut and resistance to his proposal to allow gays in the military. [...] Stephanopoulos later wrote that [...] "We should have never let the Baird nomination get {{as far as it}} did, but our systems failed us at every crucial step." [...] And the timing of the announcement of the Wood withdrawal detracted attention from the signing of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, the first legislative achievement of the Clinton administration. While a Gallup Poll showed that only 22percent of the public said that Clinton's difficulties in naming someone for Attorney General decreased their confidence in his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> the country, overall, Clinton experienced the highest disapproval ratings at the start of any presidency since such polling began.

500|$|During {{his tour}} of duty in Vietnam, Schwarzkopf {{developed}} a reputation as a commander who preferred to lead from the front, even willing to risk his own life for his subordinates. His leadership style stressed preparedness, discipline and rigorous training, but also allowed his troops to enjoy the luxuries they had. His rehabilitation of the 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry stressed survival as well as offense. Like Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel and General George S. Patton, Schwarzkopf highly regarded decisiveness and valued determination among his commanders. He pushed for offensive combat over defensive operations in the Gulf War. He was known to be extremely critical of staff officers who were unprepared, but was even more contentious with other generals who he felt were not aggressive enough. His frequently short temper with subordinates was well known in his command. His leadership style was sometimes criticized by subordinates who felt it reduced their ability to solve problems creatively. Army Chief of Staff Carl E. Vuono, a lifelong friend of Schwarzkopf, described him as [...] "competent, compassionate, egotistical, loyal, opinionated, funny, emotional, sensitive to any slight. At times he can be an overbearing bastard, but not with me." [...] While Colin Powell would say Schwarzkopf's strengths outweighed his weaknesses, Dick Cheney personally disliked what he considered Schwarzkopf's pretentious behavior with subordinates. Cheney doubted Schwarzkopf's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> the Gulf War, and so Powell dealt with Schwarzkopf instead.|$|E
500|$|Factionalism {{within the}} PDPA made it ill {{prepared}} {{to handle the}} intensified counter-revolutionary activities in the country. Amin tried to win support for the communist government by depicting himself as a devout Muslim. Taraki and Amin blamed different countries for helping the counter-revolutionaries; Amin attacked the United Kingdom and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and played down American and Chinese involvement, while Taraki blamed American imperialism and Iran and Pakistan for supporting the uprising. Amin's criticism of the United Kingdom and the BBC fed on the traditional anti-British sentiments held by rural Afghans. In contrast to Taraki, [...] "Amin bent over backwards to avoid making hostile reference to", China, the United States or other foreign governments. Amin's cautious behavior was in deep contrast to the Soviet Union's official stance on the situation; it seemed, according to Beverley Male, that the Soviet leadership tried to force a confrontation between Afghanistan and its enemies. Amin also tried to appease the Shia communities by meeting with their leaders; despite this, {{a section of the}} Shia leadership called for the continuation of the resistance. Subsequently a revolt broke out in a Shia populated district in Kabul; this was the first sign of unrest in Kabul since the Saur Revolution. To add to the government's problems, Taraki's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> the country was questioned – he was a heavy drinker and was not in good health. Amin on the other hand was characterised in this period by portrayals of strong self-discipline. In the summer of 1979 Amin began to disassociate himself from Taraki. On 27 June Amin {{became a member of the}} PDPA Politburo, the leading decision-making body in Afghanistan.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} accompanying music video was positive. Prior to its release, Jenna Halley Rubenstein of MTV Buzzworthy {{predicted that the}} video would depict women who triumphed over broken relationships as a homage to self-sufficiency. However, she praised the different treatment of the video, complimenting the synchronized dancing and thought that Clarkson kept it classy. Leah Collins of The Vancouver Sun interpreted that the video depicts Clarkson developing a sense of strength and endurance {{as well as an}} <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> a large-scale dance routine after surviving a trauma. Erin Strecker of Entertainment Weekly enjoyed Clarkson's goofy expressions and perceived the video as [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] round two. Rand Duren of The Dallas Morning News also reiterated that the music video is a reminiscent of [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] and that it was great seeing more dancing and movement from Clarkson. Contessa Gayles of AOL.com described the song as [...] "powerful" [...] and [...] "uplifting" [...] and she believed that the music video did the song justice. Trent Maynard of 4Music had a positive response towards the video and deemed Clarkson's look as properly fit in the video. He concluded his review writing, [...] "Nobody has a sense of humor quite like the original American Idol. Oh Kelly, you're the best." [...] The same opinion was echoed by Robbie Daw of Idolator who thought the video was fun especially [...] "when Kelly herself joins the giant mob at the very end." [...] He also stated that his personal favorite clip in the video was [...] "the girls who do the moves underwater with fish swimming all around them."
