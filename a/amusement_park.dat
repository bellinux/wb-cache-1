40|$|Through {{the last}} hundred years, the state of Ohio has had a high {{concentration}} of <b>amusement</b> <b>parks</b> located outside its towns and cities. The numbers peaked in the 1920 s, and have steadily decreased since that time. <b>Amusement</b> <b>parks</b> represent a unique period in a community's history, usually one of economic prosperity, and are threatened by large, corporate-owned parks and low attendance. This creative project studies Ohio's <b>amusement</b> <b>parks.</b> It traces the broad history of <b>amusement</b> <b>parks</b> from their roots in Europe to early American influence such as the World's Columbian Exposition and Coney Island in New York. The project also focuses on park development within the state of Ohio, and discusses the physical patterns that emerged out of the <b>amusement</b> <b>parks,</b> as well as the positive and negative social patterns that have surfaced and their impact today. The project suggests further areas of research needed for <b>amusement</b> <b>parks,</b> as well as steps that may help preserve those that are threatened. The project also includes an inventory of all known <b>amusement</b> <b>parks</b> located in Ohio throughout the state's history. The inventory includes the location, dates of operation, and attractions at the parks. It also categorizes parks according to the varieties found in Ohio. Department of ArchitectureThesis (M. S. H.

The game's main hub is Doctor Eggman's Incredible Interstellar <b>Amusement</b> <b>Park,</b> an interplanetary <b>amusement</b> <b>park</b> that consists of six small planets chained to each other. Sonic must be guided through these planets to destroy the power source at their center.|$|E
5|$|Sonic {{proceeds}} {{to visit the}} planets, liberating the Wisps and shutting down the generators linked to the <b>amusement</b> <b>park.</b> He meets many of his friends along the way, including Cream, Knuckles, Shadow, Amy, and the Chaotix. After Sonic frees the Wisps, Eggman tries to fire the cannon at the world, but a piece of wreckage causes it to malfunction. As the <b>amusement</b> <b>park</b> begins to explode, Sonic confronts Eggman. Eggman uses the Nega-Wisps to power his final contraption, a robot that uses the powers of all the Wisps that Sonic has met against him. As the machine gets weaker, the Wisps escape and help Sonic defeat Eggman, sending him hurtling off into space. The Wisps carry Sonic out of the exploding <b>amusement</b> <b>park.</b> Returning safely to Earth, Yacker thanks Sonic and Tails.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explain the {{function}} of the <b>amusement</b> <b>parks</b> in the society, clarify the reasons people spend their free time in those places, characterize the supply and demand of these facilities and {{on the basis of the}} examples, with the use of theories of regional development, show their regional impacts. As an case study the German market of <b>amusement</b> <b>parks</b> was chosen. This thesis is structured into several sections in which the topic is analysed from different points of view. The first part of the work deals with the current practice of spending leisure time in Germany and the Czech republic. An analysis of the market of <b>amusement</b> <b>parks</b> follows. The last part of the work debates the role of <b>amusement</b> <b>parks</b> in regional development. Additionally included is an analysis of the regional impacts of a specific facility: Legoland, which is located in Bayern, Germany. This work aims to recommend how to eventually implement <b>amusement</b> <b>parks</b> into the Czech environment. This had been summarized in the ninth chapter...|$|R

25|$|By the 1950s, {{factors such}} as urban decay, crime, and even {{desegregation}} in the ghettos led to changing patterns in how people chose to spend their free time. Many of the older, traditional <b>amusement</b> <b>parks</b> closed or burned to the ground. Many would be taken out by the wrecking ball {{to make way for}} suburban housing and development. In 1964, Steeplechase Park, once the king of all <b>amusement</b> <b>parks,</b> closed down for good. The traditional <b>amusement</b> <b>parks</b> which survived, for example, Kennywood, in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, and Cedar Point, in Sandusky, Ohio, did so in spite of the odds.|$|R
