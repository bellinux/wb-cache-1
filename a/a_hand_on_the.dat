25|$|Physical prompts: Physically {{manipulating}} {{the individual to}} produce the desired response. There are many degrees of physical prompts, from quite intrusive (e.g. the teacher places <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> learner's hand) to minimally intrusive (e.g. a slight tap).|$|E
25|$|Cadet {{candidates}} were taught {{the ideals of}} the party by the Nationalist Municipal Board President. They were then required to take an oath of allegiance to the PRNP. During the verbal oath ceremony the cadets had to place <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Nationalist flag, which was itself symbolic.|$|E
25|$|Managers {{should know}} the {{effectiveness}} of using touch while communicating to subordinates, but need to be cautious and understand how touch can be misunderstood. <b>A</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shoulder for one person may mean a supportive gesture, while it could mean a sexual advance to another person. Working with others and using touch to communicate, a manager needs {{to be aware of}} each person’s touch tolerance.|$|E
50|$|During summers, Jackson {{worked as}} <b>a</b> deck <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> MV Americana. After graduating from college, {{he spent a}} few years working on {{schooner}}s, both in Michigan, as <b>a</b> deck <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> schooner Malabar, and in Maine, as first mate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Mercantile. He also worked as a producer and host for WGVU, a National Public Radio affiliate in Michigan, replacing Bill Freeman as {{the host of the}} Morning Show in 1997.|$|R

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>Hand</b> Is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Gate is a play {{presented}} off-Broadway in 1966 {{that was}} actor Roscoe Lee Browne's Broadway directorial debut. Josephine Premice received a Tony nomination for her performance.|$|R
25|$|In 1929, she {{starred in}} the partial-sound film, The Godless Girl, {{directed}} by Cecil B. DeMille. This is the role for which she is best known. Basquette plays the title character Judith, who is based on Queen Silver, a child prodigy who early made speeches as a Socialist activist. Judith {{is the leader of}} a high school atheist society; she forces members to renounce The Bible while placing <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head of a live monkey.|$|E
25|$|In Aztec folklore, the ahuizotl was a dog-like water monster with <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{end of its}} coiled tail. It {{was said}} to dwell {{underwater}} near river banks and would drag the unwary to a watery death. The victim's soul would be carried off to Tlalocan, {{one of the three}} Aztec paradises. A similar belief existed among the neighbouring Purépechas, their dog-god was called Uitzimengari and he saved the souls of drowned people by carrying them across to the Land of the Dead.|$|E
25|$|They faced Griqualand West in the 1970 final, with Griqualand West winning 11-9 {{thanks to}} two tries from winger Buddy Swarts. Buurman van Zyl {{described}} {{this as the}} single most disappointing occasion in his 14 seasons at Northerns. The 1971 team did not lose a single game and was most unlucky to play to a draw against Transvaal in the final, 14-all at Ellis Park in Johannesburg. The controversy which surrounded Transvaal's equalising points - a try by prop Theo Sauerman - once again emphasized the necessity of objective referees for Currie Cup finals. Chris Luther kicked a huge penalty that put the game beyond question in injury time and the fans started to run onto the field. The referee ordered them off and {{indicated that there was}} still time left. From the restart, Transvaal got possession and after some good support play scored a try. Jannie van Deventer kicked the conversion and Transvaal got <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Cup. This final marked {{the end of an era}} for Frik du Preez who announced his retirement from the game.|$|E

25|$|Florian fought Clay Guida on December 12, 2009 at UFC 107. During {{the second}} round, Florian caught Guida with <b>a</b> right <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chin that dropped Guida. He {{followed}} up with a short flurry and finished the fight via rear naked choke at 2:19.|$|R
25|$|Another major {{aspect of}} the {{gameplay}} is the alethiometer, (a rare truth-telling device which features in the novels). Once the player {{has access to the}} Alethiometer, it can be asked certain set questions. The device has thirty-six symbols on its outer edge, each with three meanings. These meanings are discovered over the course of game; some are learned automatically as the plot advances, others must be sought out by the player and can be missed. For each question, Lyra is given three words, and each word is assigned <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Alethiometer. If Lyra knows the corresponding symbol of a given word, the hand automatically turns to the correct symbol. Words she doesn't know must be guessed by the player. When the three hands are all pointing at symbols, the player confirms the selection and Lyra asks the question. A balancing minigame then begins, where the player must press buttons corresponding to the on-screen display. The more symbols which were correctly identified {{in the first part of}} the game, the easier the balancing game is. If the player successfully completes the balancing game, the Alethiometer will answer the question.|$|E

500|$|Elephant Walk {{began in}} 1926, {{when a group}} of {{students}} decided to take one last walk around campus to remember their experiences at the school. Because they walked single file, with <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shoulder of the person in front, an observer remarked that they [...] "looked like elephants, about to die." [...] The day now begins at Kyle Field with a yell practice and speaker, and then the senior yell leaders lead the class through campus. Leaders of the graduating class also announce the class gift at Elephant Walk.|$|E

50|$|Melaleuca pomphostoma {{is similar}} to Melaleuca bracteosa but differs from it in having fewer stamens (M. bracteosa has 7 to 11 per bundle), a {{different}} leaf shape and distinctive, numerous, white raised stomata, which are barely visible with <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> lens, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> leaf blades.|$|R
50|$|Aubrey Cosens {{was born}} in Latchford, Ontario on May 21, 1921, the only son to Mr. and Mrs. Charles Cosens.

500|$|People {{have given}} the finger {{as a method of}} {{political}} protest. [...] At a concert, Ricky Martin gave a picture of George W. Bush the finger to protest the War in Iraq. Serbian protesters gave the finger to the Russian embassy regarding their support of Slobodan Milošević. Artist Ai Weiwei has used the finger in photographs and sculptures as a political statement. As a political message to the Czech President, Czech artist David Cerny floated an outsize, purple statue of <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> River Vltava in Prague; its middle finger extended towards Prague Castle, the Presidential seat.|$|E
500|$|Other presidents, {{as well as}} First Ladies, {{are also}} said to haunt the White House. Witnesses {{in the past two}} centuries have {{reported}} that Thomas Jefferson can be heard playing his violin in the Yellow Oval Room. President Andrew Jackson is said to be seen lying on what is thought to be his old bed [...] in the Queens' Bedroom (also known as the Rose Room), and his guttural laugh has been heard in the White House {{since the beginning of the}} 1860s. First Lady press secretary Liz Carpenter heard the laugh and swore it was Jackson's, and Mary Todd Lincoln claimed to have heard the stomping and swearing of an invisible presence which she claimed was the uncouth Jackson. White House seamstress Lillian Rogers Parks said she was sewing in the Queen's Bedroom and felt a presence, cold air, and then <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back of her chair. She quickly left the room, and for the rest of her time in the White House she refused to enter the room again without at least one other person accompanying her. The spirit of William Henry Harrison, it is claimed, haunts the attic, and President John Tyler allegedly haunts the Blue Room. First Lady Frances Folsom Cleveland, who was married to President Grover Cleveland in the White House's Blue Room in 1886, is widely claimed to haunt the room where she was married and was seen there after her death in 1947.|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{said there}} was just no way they were getting {{into the end zone}} after they blocked that punt," [...] said Simpson (a college {{teammate}} of DuPree at Michigan State University) after the game. [...] We've come through too far and gone through too much. [...] Staubach went to the wide receivers twice before, and we figured he'd go to DuPree. [...] We both dove for him the moment Staubach threw. [...] I think I got <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ball. [...] We had to play him tough. [...] Goddamn it was the whole season on one play. [...] That stuff happened to us too much in the past. [...] We're going all the way this time." ...|$|E
