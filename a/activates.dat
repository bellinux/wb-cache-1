5|$|Normal {{coagulation}} is {{initiated by}} the release of tissue factor from damaged tissue. Tissue factor binds to circulating factor VIIa. The combination <b>activates</b> factor X to factor Xa and factor IX to factor IXa. Factor Xa (in the presence of factor V) <b>activates</b> prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin is a central enzyme in the coagulation process: it generates fibrin from fibrinogen, and <b>activates</b> {{a number of other}} enzymes and cofactors (factor XIII, factor XI, factor V and factor VIII, TAFI) that enhance the fibrin clot. The process is inhibited by TFPI (which inactivates the first step catalyzed by factor VIIa/tissue factor), antithrombin (which inactivates thrombin, factor IXa, Xa and XIa), protein C (which inhibits factors Va and VIIIa in the presence of protein S), and protein Z (which inhibits factor Xa).|$|E

These last two effects are largely mediated by platelet <b>activating</b> factor forming phospholipase A 2 A 2, a key enzyme for platelet <b>activating</b> factor synthesis, was examined in mouse intestine. It was found that tumour necrosis factor alpha and endotoxin synergise to stimulate platelet <b>activating</b> factor forming phospholipase A 2 activity in the intestine, as well as platelet <b>activating</b> factor production, and these effects were blocked by pretreatment with platelet <b>activating</b> factor antagonists, SRI- 63 - 441 and WEB 2086. In addition, exogenous platelet <b>activating</b> factor stimulates intestinal phospholipase A 2 activity. These results show that tumour necrosis factor alpha and lipopolysaccharide synergistically <b>activate</b> the phospholipase A 2 that participates in platelet <b>activating</b> factor formation, and this activation is largely mediated by endogenous platelet <b>activating</b> factor. Furthermore, platelet <b>activating</b> factor itself increases phospholipase A 2 activity, suggesting that platelet <b>activating</b> factor induces its own synthesis, probably by phospholipase A 2 activation...|$|R

5|$|Although the receptors for systemins and HypSys remain poorly understood, we have {{a better}} {{understanding}} of the signal transduction that occurs once the peptide had bound to its receptor. Jasmonic acid is an essential, albeit late component, in the systemin and wound-signalling pathways. In tomato, the signal is transduced from the receptor by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Cosilencing of two MAPKs, MPK1 and MPK2, in tomato compromised their defence response against insect larvae compared to wild type plants. Cosilencing these genes also decreased production of jasmonic acid and of jasmonic acid-dependent defence genes. Applying methyl jasmonate to cosilenced plants rescued them, indicating that jasmonates are the signal responsible for causing changes in gene expression. The alkalisation of the apoplast is a downstream effect of signalling processing by MAPKs. Applying fusicoccin, which <b>activates</b> the H+ ATPase inhibited by systemin, along with systemin still <b>activates</b> MAPKs, even though the pH of the apoplast does not change.|$|E

Thus, Factor VII was not <b>activated</b> in Factor XII-,HMW kininogen-, XI-, and IX-deficient plasmas, but was <b>activated</b> in Factor VIII-, X-, and V-deficient plasmas.
