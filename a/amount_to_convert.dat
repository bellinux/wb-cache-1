60|$|After ten {{thousand}} generations, species (A) {{is supposed to}} have produced three forms, a10, f10, and m10, which, from having diverged in character during the successive generations, will have come to differ largely, but perhaps unequally, from each other and from their common parent. If we suppose the amount of change between each horizontal line in our diagram to be excessively small, these three forms may still be only well-marked varieties; but we have only to suppose the steps in the process of modification to be more numerous or greater in <b>amount,</b> <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> these three forms into doubtful or at least into well-defined species: thus the diagram illustrates the steps by which the small differences distinguishing varieties are increased into the larger differences distinguishing species. By continuing the same process for a greater number of generations (as shown in the diagram in a condensed and simplified manner), we get eight species, marked by the letters between a14 and m14, all descended from (A). Thus, as I believe, species are multiplied and genera are formed.|$|E

40|$|An {{electrochemical}} {{approach has}} previously been described for the selenenylation-deselenenylation of alkenes using diphenyl diselenide. The use of electrochemistry enabled diphenyl diselenide {{to be used in}} catalytic <b>amounts</b> <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> alkenes into allylic ethers. i 10 mol% (PhSe) 2 Electrolysis OMe The electrochemical use of diselenides bearing a chiral side chain has now been investigated. The initial investigations involved the use of diphenyl diselenide, in conditions which varied considerably from those described previously in the literature. By using just 10 mol% diphenyl diselenide, the conversion of alkene A into allylic ether B was achieved in 91 % yield. OMe PhAArn, 10 mol% (ArSe) 2 Ar=Ph 91 % yield Ph CO 2 Me - Ph C 02 Me Ar=Chiral 55 % yield Electrolysis A B Having established viable conditions using diphenyl diselenide, a range of chiral non-racemic diselenides was now used for the same conversion. Mixed results were obtained, with yields of B ranging from 19 % to 55 % and selectivities ranging from 0 % to 69 % ee. The reaction of several chiral diselenides was investigated in depth and a likely mechanism for the addition elimination sequence proposed. The investigation was widened to include more alkenes and different reaction conditions, though no alkenes proved as ideal a substrate as A. In an attempt to improve the efficiency of these electrochemical reactions, the synthesis of novel diselenides incorporating new design principles was undertaken, resulting in the synthesis of diselenide C which provided the highest selectivity in the electrochemical reaction.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the forecasting performance of a well-defined class of flexible models, the so-called single hidden-layer feedforward neural network models. A major aim of our study {{is to find out}} whether they, due to their flexibility, are as useful tools in economic forecasting as some previous studies have indicated. When forecasting with neural network models one faces several problems, all of which influence the accuracy of the forecasts. First, neural networks are often hard to estimate due to their highly nonlinear structure. In fact, their parameters are not even globally identified. Recently, White (2006) presented a solution that <b>amounts</b> <b>to</b> <b>converting</b> the specification and nonlinear estimation problem into a linear model selection and estimation problem. He called this procedure the QuickNet and we shall compare its performance to two other procedures which are built on the linearisation idea: the Marginal Bridge Estimator and Autometrics. Second, one must decide whether forecasting should be carried out recursively or directly. Comparisons of these two methodss exist for linear models and here these comparisons are extended to neural networks. Finally, a nonlinear model such as the neural network model is not appropriate if the data is generated by a linear mechanism. Hence, it might be appropriate to test the null of linearity prior to building a nonlinear model. We investigate whether this kind of pretesting improves the forecast accuracy compared to the case where this is not done. artificial neural network, forecast comparison, model selection, nonlinear autoregressive model, nonlinear time series, root mean square forecast error, Wilcoxon’s signed-rank test...|$|R
50|$|Rugby {{league has}} tried out similar bonus point systems in some {{competitions}}, but most competitions only give points for wins and draws. However, from 2007 season through to 2014, the Championship and League 1 (the two levels below Super League), primarily in England but also featuring teams in France and Wales {{during this time}} frame, gave 3 points for a win, 2 for a draw, and 1 for a loss by 12 points or fewer (this <b>amounts</b> <b>to</b> two <b>converted</b> tries in rugby league, which gives 4 points for a try instead of 5 in union). This changed in the 2015 season when the points system was brought into line with that of Super League, thereby standardising the system across Britain's three professional Rugby League divisions, abandoning the bonus points system.|$|R

Based on comparative static analyses of an optimal control model, and a numerical application, we find that the optimal proportion of land to shift into bio-energy production from a baseline use, such as the Conservation Reserve Program, depends on key model parameters, specifically the rate of degradation of the pollutant and the link between the intensity of bio-energy feedstock production and the rate of change in the pollutant stock. Yet, {{there is a limit to}} how much land should optimally be converted as society must trade-off its desire to mitigate climate change against its willingness to accept a decline in water qualit...|$|R
