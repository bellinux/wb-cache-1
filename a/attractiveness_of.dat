5|$|A {{special case}} of natural {{selection}} is sexual selection, which is selection for any trait that increases mating success by increasing the <b>attractiveness</b> <b>of</b> an organism to potential mates. Traits that evolved through sexual selection are particularly prominent among males of several animal species. Although sexually favoured, traits such as cumbersome antlers, mating calls, large body size and bright colours often attract predation, which compromises the survival of individual males. This survival disadvantage is balanced by higher reproductive success in males that show these hard-to-fake, sexually selected traits.|$|E
5|$|Alcibiades {{was married}} to Hipparete, the {{daughter}} of Hipponicus, a wealthy Athenian. His bride brought with her a large dowry, which significantly increased Alcibiades' already substantial family fortune. According to Plutarch, Hipparete loved her husband, but she attempted to divorce him because he consorted with courtesans but he dragged her away from her court appearance. She lived with him until her death, which came soon after, and gave birth to two children, a daughter and a son, Alcibiades the Younger. Alcibiades was famed throughout his life for his physical <b>attractiveness,</b> <b>of</b> which he was inordinately vain.|$|E
40|$|Most {{of what we}} {{know about}} what makes a face {{attractive}} and why we have the preferences we do is based on <b>attractiveness</b> ratings <b>of</b> static images of faces, usually photographs. However, several reports that such ratings fail to correlate significantly with ratings made to dynamic video clips, which provide richer samples of appearance, challenge the validity of this literature. Here, we tested the validity <b>of</b> <b>attractiveness</b> ratings made to static images, using a substantial sample of male faces. We found that these ratings agreed very strongly with ratings made to videos of these men, despite the presence of much more information in the videos (multiple views, neutral and smiling expressions and speech-related movements). Not surprisingly, given this high agreement, the components of video-attractiveness were also very similar to those reported previously for static-attractiveness. Specifically, averageness, symmetry and masculinity were all significant components <b>of</b> <b>attractiveness</b> rated from videos. Finally, regression analyses yielded very similar effects <b>of</b> <b>attractiveness</b> on success in obtaining sexual partners, whether attractiveness was rated from videos or static images. These results validate the widespread use <b>of</b> <b>attractiveness</b> ratings made to static images in evolutionary and social psychological research. We speculate that this validity may stem from our tendency to make rapid and robust judgements <b>of</b> <b>attractiveness...</b>|$|R
40|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>attractiveness</b> pervades {{every aspect}} of society in the United States. Attractiveness is used to {{manipulate}} decisions, desires, and even needs; in turn, society allows itself to be manipulated by the same concept <b>of</b> <b>attractiveness.</b> This {{study was designed to}} determine if hair color plays a role in the perception <b>of</b> <b>attractiveness.</b> A questionnaire was administered to 36 West Virginia State College students.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} meta-perceptions <b>of</b> <b>attractiveness</b> among women. More specifically, ratings were collected about how women thought their partner, family and friends, and strangers would view their physical attractiveness. In an online survey, 1287 Dutch women (aged 19 - 80 years) answered questions concerning meta-perceptions <b>of</b> <b>attractiveness,</b> demographic data, {{body mass index}} (BMI), body image (Body Areas Satisfaction Scale, self-rated general physical attractiveness, and actual-ideal weight discrepancy), and self-esteem. Results showed that women's meta-perceptions <b>of</b> <b>attractiveness</b> reflected the level of closeness of {{the relationship with the}} other person, with the most positive meta-perceptions reported for the partner, followed by those for family and friends, and the least positive meta-perceptions for strangers. Meta-perceptions were strongly related to body image, self-esteem and BMI. Self-ratings <b>of</b> <b>attractiveness</b> appeared to be lower than all meta-perceptions <b>of</b> <b>attractiveness,</b> suggesting that women are aware of their own negative self-bias and/or other people's positive bias.

In Europe, Fraxinus excelsior is the main ash species colonized by EAB. Ash susceptibility can vary due to the <b>attractiveness</b> <b>of</b> chemical volatiles to adults, or the ability of larvae to detoxify phenolic compounds. Emerald ash borer has also been found infesting white fringe tree in North America, which is a non-ash host, but {{it is unclear whether}} the trees were healthy when first infested, or were already in decline due to drought.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{documents that}} men and women can accurately judge male physical strength from gait, but also that the sexes differ in <b>attractiveness</b> judgments <b>of</b> strong and weak male walkers. Women’s (but not men’s) <b>attractiveness</b> assessments <b>of</b> strong male walkers are higher than for weak male walkers. Here, we extend this research to assessments of strong and weak male walkers in Chile, Germany, and Russia. Men and women judged videos of virtual characters, animated with the walk movements of motion-captured men, on strength and attractiveness. In two countries (Germany and Russia), these videos were additionally presented at 70 % (slower) and 130 % (faster) of their original speed. Stronger walkers were judged to be stronger and more attractive than weak walkers, and this effect was independent of country (but not sex). Women tended to provide higher attractiveness judgments to strong walkers, and men tended to provide higher attractiveness judgments to weak walkers. In addition, German and Russian participants rated strong walkers most attractive at slow and fast speed. Thus, across countries men and women can assess male strength from gait, although they tended to differ in <b>attractiveness</b> assessments <b>of</b> strong and weak male walkers. <b>Attractiveness</b> assessments <b>of</b> male gait may be influenced by society-specific emphasis on male physical strength...|$|R
5|$|An {{animal that}} is {{commonly}} {{thought to be}} dazzle-patterned is the zebra. The bold stripes of the zebra have been claimed to be disruptive camouflage, background-blending and countershading. After many years in which {{the purpose of the}} coloration was disputed, an experimental study by Tim Caro suggested in 2012 that the pattern reduces the <b>attractiveness</b> <b>of</b> stationary models to biting flies such as horseflies and tsetse flies. However, a simulation study by Martin How and Johannes Zanker in 2014 suggests that when moving, the stripes may confuse observers, such as mammalian predators and biting insects, by two visual illusions: the wagon-wheel effect, where the perceived motion is inverted, and the barberpole illusion, where the perceived motion is in a wrong direction.|$|E
5|$|During the Anglo-Saxon period, many shrines {{were built}} on former pagan sites which became popular pilgrimage destinations, while other pilgrims visited {{prominent}} monasteries and sites of learning. Senior nobles or kings would travel to Rome, {{which was a}} popular destination from the 7th century onwards; sometimes these trips were a form of convenient political exile. Under the Normans, religious institutions with important shrines, such as Glastonbury, Canterbury and Winchester, promoted themselves as pilgrimage destinations, maximising {{the value of the}} historic miracles associated with the sites. Accumulating relics became an important task for ambitious institutions, as these were believed to hold curative powers and lent status to the site. Indeed, by the 12th century reports of posthumous miracles by local saints were becoming increasing common in England, adding to the <b>attractiveness</b> <b>of</b> pilgrimages to prominent relics.|$|E
5|$|Tourism {{has grown}} in Dorset since the late 18th century {{and is now the}} {{predominant}} industry. It is estimated that 37,500 people work in Dorset's tourism sector. Some 3.2million British and 326,000 foreign tourists visited the county in 2008, staying a total of 15.1 million nights. In addition there were 14.6million day visitors. The combined spending of both groups was £1,458million. Towns received 56% of Dorset's day trippers, 27% went to the coast and 17% to the countryside. A survey carried out in 1997 concluded that the primary reason tourists were drawn to Dorset was the <b>attractiveness</b> <b>of</b> the county's coast and countryside. Numbers of domestic and foreign tourists have fluctuated in recent years due to various factors including security and economic downturn, a trend reflected throughout the UK.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} {{impact of the}} women‟s sexual desire level on judgments <b>of</b> <b>attractiveness</b> and beauty <b>of</b> men‟s faces and voices. Firstly we collected the men‟s and women‟s faces and voices to create GENEVA ATTRACTIVNESS DATABASE (GEAD) and {{in the current study}} we use the men‟s stimuli collected for the population of women with different sexual desire level. We tested two different groups: clinical group (low sexual desire, N = 16) and control group (normal sexual desire, N = 21 and high sexual desire hyper sexuality, N = 20). Results suggest that the sexual desire is positively correlated with judgments <b>of</b> <b>attractiveness</b> but negatively correlated with judgments of beauty. As expected, the clinical group with low sexual desire was significantly different from control group in judgments <b>of</b> <b>attractiveness</b> but not in judgments of beauty. Overall, results suggest that there is some dissociation between judgments <b>of</b> <b>attractiveness</b> and beauty in accordance with sexual desire level. Therefore, future studies should investigate cognitive processes involved in the pathology of desire more in depth to better understand low sexual desire...|$|R

5|$|Colley Cibber was {{a rather}} {{unsuccessful}} young actor {{at the time of}} the split, with a squeaky voice and without any of the physical <b>attractiveness</b> <b>of</b> the soon-to-be-dead Horden. After the success of Love's Last Shift, his status was transformed, with both companies vying for his services as actor and playwright. He made an off-season transfer to Betterton's company in the summer of 1696 and wrote part of a play for the rebels before being re-seduced by Rich by means of a fat contract (Milhous). Cibber as Lord Foppington was thus also assured, and finally the première of The Relapse could be scheduled with some confidence. Cibber's performance in it was received with even greater acclaim than in his own play, Vanbrugh's Lord Foppington being a larger and, in the estimation of both contemporaries and modern critics, much funnier part than Sir Novelty Fashion. Vanbrugh's play incorporates some of the ad-libbing and affectations of Cibber's by all accounts inspired performance in Love's Last Shift. Cibber has thus imprinted not only his own playwriting but also his acting style and squeaky personality on Vanbrugh's best-known character.|$|E

30|$|Moving {{ahead with}} this {{exploratory}} results interpretation, {{as for the}} associations of the odd managerial action of moving away from having a license specified to not having one (type of change with “A” as target) with attractiveness variations, the average <b>attractiveness</b> ratio <b>of</b> projects that have undergone this type of change {{have been found to}} be always detrimental to <b>attractiveness</b> (column A <b>of</b> Table 5), demonstrating that stakeholders do not like the uncertainty associated with a project with no license. By looking at the interventions with A (the none choice) as target in Table 5, it is noteworthy that every time such change was made, the average project attractiveness decreased (a number smaller than one indicates the <b>attractiveness</b> ratio <b>of</b> after/before the change is on average pushed down). Additionally, when a project went from none to a restrictive and relicensable choice (A → E), this change was associated with an average change of 14 % in attractiveness.|$|R
40|$|Young {{people in}} care {{are known to}} have high levels of {{aggressive}} behaviors and high levels of self-esteem, and these difficulties continue into adult life. Previous research has suggested that there is a relationship between self-esteem and aggression, although the nature of this relationship is unclear and possible differences due to gender have rarely been explored. Therefore, the relationships between different forms of self-esteem (global self-esteem, social rank, social fit, and attractiveness) and aggression were investigated in a sample of young care-leavers. For men, high levels of social rank and high levels <b>of</b> <b>attractiveness</b> were predictive <b>of</b> aggression, whereas for women low levels of perceived social inclusion and low levels <b>of</b> <b>attractiveness</b> were predictive <b>of</b> aggression. These findings suggest that there are significant gender differences in the relationship between self-esteem and aggression in care-leavers and that using domain-specific measures of self-esteem provides a richer understanding of these relationships. They also suggest that a more targeted approach to intervention is needed...|$|R
