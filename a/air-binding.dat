40|$|The paper {{introduces}} a new composite material with molding α calcined gypsum matrix and EP type polymers reinforcing material (bloated polystyrene) as flakes and granules The bloated polystyrene flakes, granules or powder addition had used {{in order to}} improve the heating and sonic properties of the composite material. The technological process of α-calcined gypsum production has combined with a pneumatic homogenizer necessary for the counter flow mixing with the flakes or EP granules reinforcing material. The tests carried out by SC “CONGIPS ” SA ORADEA resulted in the optimization of the new composite materials main features, such as: setting time, setting start and end, compression resistance, flexion mechanical resistance, density. Mixing formulas, research methodology and methods had based on the tests and determinations specific to building materials performed by means of <b>air-binding</b> matters. The new composite materials can be successfully use in the production process of gypsum, regypsum and digypsum sound-absorbing panels used for environmental noise decrease purposes. 1...|$|E
