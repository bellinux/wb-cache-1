40|$|We {{report a}} case of <b>acne</b> <b>neonatorum</b> {{developed}} in a boy since birth. His mother and his aunt had different signs of hyperandrogenism including acne and hirsutism. This case illustrates the correlation between <b>acne</b> <b>neonatorum</b> and familial hyperandrogenism. It shows {{the importance of the}} family history and the eventual clinical and serological presence of hyperandrogenism in the mother when confronted with <b>acne</b> <b>neonatorum.</b> SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Acne</b> <b>neonatorum</b> (AN) is {{characterized}} by a facial eruption of inflammatory and noninflammatory acne lesions in a neonate. Hyperactivity of sebaceous glands, stimulated by neonatal androgens, is implicated in its pathogenesis. Aim: To elucidate the clinical profile of AN in eastern Saudi Arabia. Methods: All patients diagnosed with AN in King Fahd Hospital of the University in Khobar, Saudi Arabia, during the year 2005 were evaluated clinically. Results: AN was diagnosed in 26 patients (male/female ratio 1 : 1). The lesions included mainly facial comedones (30. 8 &#x 0025;); papules and pustules (15. 3 &#x 0025; each); and combination of papules, pustules, and cysts (53. 4 &#x 0025;). Conclusion: All patients recovered spontaneously. In 50 &#x 0025; of the cases, one of the parents reported having had acne vulgaris during adolescence. Hereditary factors seem to {{play a significant role in}} our series...|$|E
