40|$|A few Pseudomonas {{species are}} able to form hydrocyanic acid (HCN), {{particularly}} when grown under glycine-rich conditions. In the presence of metals, cyanide can form water-soluble metal complexes of high chemical stability. We studied the possibility to mobilize metals as cyanide complexes from solid minerals using HCN-forming microorganisms. Pseudomonas plecoglossicida was cultivated {{in the presence of}} copper- and nickel-containing solid minerals. On powdered elemental nickel, fast HCN generation within the first 12  h of incubation was observed and water-soluble tetracyanaonickelate was formed. Cuprite, tenorite, chrysocolla, malachite, bornite, turquoise, millerite, pentlandite as well as shredded electronic scrap was also subjected to a biological treatment. Maximum concentrations of cyanide-complexed copper corresponded to a solubilization of 42 % and 27 % when P. plecoglossicida was grown in the presence of cuprite or tenorite, respectively. Crystal system, metal oxidation state and mineral hydrophobicity might have a significant influence on metal mobilization. However, {{it was not possible to}} <b>allocate</b> <b>metal</b> mobilization to a single mineral property. Cyanide-complexed gold was detected during growth on manually cut circuit boards. Maximum dicyanoaurate concentration corresponded to a 68. 5 % dissolution of the total gold added. These findings represent a novel type of microbial mobilization of nickel and copper from solid minerals based on the ability of certain microbes to form HC...|$|R
40|$|High {{concentrations}} of Cd, Pb, Cu and Cr can cause harmful effects to the environment. These highly toxic pollutants constitute a risk for aquatic and terrestrial life. They {{are associated with}} diverse bioavailable geochemical fractions, like the water-soluble fraction and the exchangeable fraction, and non-available fractions like those associated with the crystalline net of clays and silica minerals. Depending upon their chemical and physical properties we can distinguish different mechanisms of metal toxicity in plants, such as production of reactive oxygen species from auto-oxidation, blocking and/or displacement of essential functional groups or metallic ions of biomolecules, changes in the permeability of cellular membranes, reactions of sulphydryl groups with cations, affinity for reactions with phosphate groups and active groups of ADP or ATP, substitution of essential ions, induction of chromosomal anomalies and decrease of the cellular division rate. However, some plant species have developed tolerance or resistance to these metals naturally. Such evolution of ecotypes {{is a classic example}} of local adaptation and microevolution, restricted to species with appropriate genetic variability. Phytoremediator woody species, with (i) high biomass production, (ii) a deep root system, (iii) high growth rate, (iv) high capacity to grow in impoverished soils, and (v) high capacity to <b>allocate</b> <b>metals</b> in the trunk, can be an alternative for the recovery of degraded soils due to excess of metallic elements. Phytoremediation using woody species presents advantageous characteristics as an economic and ecologically viable system, making it an appropriate, practical and successful technology...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNickel is one {{of several}} {{transition}} metal cations that have an important function in bacterial cells. Owing to similar sizes and chemical properties, all transition metal cations interact with each other’s metabolism in biological systems. The task of a cell is to acquire sufficient nickel ions from its environment and to <b>allocate</b> this <b>metal</b> ion efficiently to nickel-dependent proteins. This must be done without causing too much collateral damage due to the potential negative effects of nickel ions on the metabolism of other transition metal cations, and vice versa. This chapter describes how this can be accomplished {{from the point of view}} of the bacterial cell...|$|R
40|$|Vacuolar {{compartmentalization}} or {{cell wall}} binding in leaves {{could play a}} major role in hyperaccumulation of heavy metals. However, little is known about the physiology of intracellular cadmium (Cd) sequestration in plants. We investigated the role of the leaf cells in <b>allocating</b> <b>metal</b> in hyperaccumulating plants by measuring short-term 109 Cd and 65 Zn uptake in mesophyll protoplasts of Thlaspi caerulescens “Ganges” and Arabidopsis halleri, both hyperaccumulators of zinc (Zn) and Cd, and T. caerulescens “Prayon,” accumulating Cd at a lower degree. The effects of low temperature, several divalent cations, and pre-exposure of the plants to metals were investigated. There was no significant difference between the Michaelis-Menten kinetic constants of the three plants. It indicates that differences in metal uptake cannot be explained by different constitutive transport capacities at the leaf protoplast level and that plasma and vacuole membranes of mesophyll cells are not responsible for the differences observed in heavy metal allocation. This suggests the existence of regulation mechanisms before the plasma membrane of leaf mesophyll protoplasts. However, pre-exposure of the plants to Cd induced an increase in Cd accumulation in protoplasts of “Ganges,” whereas it decreased Cd accumulation in A. halleri protoplasts, indicating that Cd-permeable transport proteins are differentially regulated. The experiment with competitors has shown that probably more than one single transport system is carrying Cd in parallel into the cell and that in T. caerulescens “Prayon,” Cd could be transported by a Zn and Ca pathway, whereas in “Ganges,” Cd could be transported mainly by other pathways...|$|R
40|$|A compact {{apparatus}} {{is developed}} for {{deposition of metal}} thin film. The system employs an RF discharge plasma source with a straight RF antenna, which is made of or covered with deposition material, serving as sputtering target at the same time. The average deposition rate of copper thin film {{is as high as}} 450 nm/min. By properly <b>allocating</b> the <b>metal</b> materials on the sputtering antenna, mixture deposition of multiple metal species is achieved. Using an ion beam imprinting scheme also taking advantage of ion beam focusing technique, two different schemes of direct patterning deposition process are developed: direct depositing patterned metallic thin film and resistless ion beam sputter patterning. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated direct pattern transfer from a template with feature size of micro scale; patterns with more than 10 x reduction are achieved by sputtering patterning method...|$|R

40|$|The {{earliest}} of {{a series}} of copper efflux genes in Escherichia coli are controlled by CueR, a member of the MerR family of transcriptional activators. Thermodynamic calibration of CueR reveals a zeptomolar (10 � 21 molar) sensitivity to free Cu �, which is far less than one atom per cell. Atomic details of this extraordinary sensitivity and selectivity for � 1 transition-metal ions are revealed by comparing the crystal structures of CueR and a Zn 2 �-sensing homolog, ZntR. An unusual buried metal-receptor site in CueR restricts the metal to a linear, two-coordinate geometry and uses helix-dipole and hydrogenbonding interactions to enhance metal binding. This binding mode is rare among metalloproteins but well suited for an ultrasensitive genetic switch. E. coli maintain a strict cellular copper quota within a narrow range, about 10 4 atoms per cell (� 10 �M), by using numerous copper homeostasis pathways to control and <b>allocate</b> the <b>metal</b> to a few important enzymes (1, 2) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{selectivity}} {{of proteins}} involved in metal ion homeostasis {{is an important}} part of the puzzle to understand how cells <b>allocate</b> the correct <b>metal</b> ions to the correct proteins. Due to their similar ligand-binding properties, and their frequent co-existence in soils, essential zinc and toxic cadmium are a particularly challenging couple. Thus, minimisation of competition of Cd 2 + for Zn 2 + sites is of crucial importance for organisms that are in direct contact with soil. Amongst these, plants have an especially critical role, due to their importance for nutrition and energy. We have studied an embryo-specific, zinc-binding metallothionein (EC) from wheat by nuclear magnetic resonance, electrospray mass spectrometry, site-directed mutagenesis, and molecular modelling. Wheat EC exploits differences in affinities of Cys(4) and Cys(2) His(2) sites for Cd 2 + and Zn 2 + to achieve metal-selective protein folding. We propose that this may constitute a novel mechanism to discriminate between essential Zn 2 + and toxic Cd 2 +...|$|R
40|$|Background Continued {{development}} in total knee replacement aims at further improving {{quality of life}} and lengthening prosthetic survival. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the following design features on the function and survival of the implant: metal backing of the tibial component; patella resurfacing; and a mobile bearing between tibia and femur. Methods A pragmatic multicenter randomized controlled trial involving 116 surgeons in 34 United Kingdom centers, allowed randomization to more than one comparison; 2352 participants were randomly <b>allocated</b> to <b>metal</b> backing of the tibial component or not (409); patella resurfacing or not (1715); and, or, mobile bearing or not (539). The primary outcome measures were the Oxford Knee Score (OKS), Short Form- 12, EuroQual- 5 D and need for further surgery. The results are reported up to two-year follow-up. Results 2 Functional status and quality of life scores were low at baseline but improved markedly across all trial groups following knee replacement (mean overall Oxford Knee Score: 17. 98 at baseline, 34. 82 at 2 year). Most of the change was observed three-months after surgery. Six percent of patients had further knee surgery within two years. There was no evidence of differences in clinical, functional status or quality of life measures between randomized groups at two years. Conclusions Patients undergoing total knee replacement have substantial improvement. This is the first adequately powered randomized controlled trial we are aware of investigating metal backed, patella resurfacing, and mobile bearing prostheses. We found no evidence of effect of these variants on early complications or functional recovery up to two years after total knee replacement. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} high integrity, area {{efficient}} power distribution grids has become of practical importance as {{the portion of}} on-chip interconnect resources dedicated to power distribution networks in high performance integrated circuits has greatly increased. The inductive characteristics of several types of gridded power distribution networks are described in this paper. The inductance extraction program FastHenry is {{used to evaluate the}} inductive properties of grid structured interconnect. In power distribution grids with alternating power and ground lines, the inductance is shown to vary linearly with grid length and inversely linearly with the number of lines in the grid. The inductance is also relatively constant with frequency in these grid structures. These properties permit the efficient estimation of the inductive characteristics of power distribution grids. To optimize the process of <b>allocating</b> on-chip <b>metal</b> resources, inductance/area/resistance tradeoffs in high speed performance distribution grids are explored. Two tradeoff scenarios in power grids with alternating power and ground lines are considered. In the first scenario, the total area occupied by the grid lines is maintained constant and the grid inductance versus grid resistance tradeoff is evaluated as the width of the grid lines varies. In the second scenario, the metal area of the grid is maintained constant and the grid inductance versus grid area tradeoff is investigated. In both cases, the grid inductance increases virtually linearly with line width, rising more then eightfold for a tenfold increase in line width. The grid resistance and grid area, however, decrease relatively slowly with line width. This decrease in grid resistance and area is limited to a factor of two under assumed interconnect characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Heavy metals {{accumulation}} in soils as {{a result}} of human activities is constantly increasing. At this regard, phytoremediation (i. e. the use of plants to remove pollutants from the environment or to render them harmless) is attractive as it offers site restoration, partial decontamination, maintenance of the biological activity and physical structure of soils, and is potentially cheap. In a short-term experiment, cuttings of Salix alba L. were treated with a mix of heavy metal chlorides, consisting of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), {{in order to determine the}} physiological response and the uptake capacity of this species under different conditions of water availability. In fact, the willow tree is a typical species of riparian zones, and could be subjected to variable water supply due to the hydrological regime of the river (constant flow or torrential regime). The amount of absorbed <b>metals</b> <b>allocated</b> in biomass of roots, stems and leaves was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (ASS). Translocation (TF) and bioaccumulation (BAF) factors were also determined. Under non limiting water conditions, a phytotoxic effect of heavy metals was evident on gas exchanges, though a reduction of net photosynthesis mostly caused by metal-induced stomatal limitations similar to those induced by water stress. Moreover, at the end of the experiment, chlorophyll “a” fluorescence measurements (JIP-Test) highlighted a reduction of the number of active reaction centres per leaf cross section in the metal-stressed plants; this was followed by increase of the efficiency of the electron transport processes that, according to the the Lichtenthaler model of plant response to stress, can be interpreted as a response mechanism aimed at sustaining detoxification and repair processes. The analysis of heavy metals concentration in roots, stems and leaves of plants subjected to different water supply showed TF values < 1 in all sets; moreover, water shortage limited metal uptake and translocation to leaves. In conclusion, although this species cannot be considered an iperaccumulator due to its low TF, it could be used to limit heavy metals dispersion in the environment, and to restore riparian zones at polluted sites...|$|R
