The museum asked for provenance of the items to be displayed. Koch had bought four bottles in 1988, Châteaux Lafite and Branne-Mouton (present-day Château Mouton-Rothschild) of the 1784 and 1787 vintages, at a US wine auction house (Chicago Wine Company) and a UK rare wine dealer (Farr Vintners), and paid {{a total of about}} 500,000 US dollars for them. When Koch's staff couldn't find anything but Michael Broadbent's <b>authentification</b> of the bottles to back up their provenance, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation at Monticello, Charlottesville, Virginia was contacted. The foundation's curator replied that based on Jefferson's records, the foundation didn't think that the bottles had been in the possession of Thomas Jefferson. Inquiries at Chicago Wine Company and Farr Vintners came up with the result that all four of Koch's bottles originated with Rodenstock.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the person <b>authentification</b> system SESAM. Person identification and verification still {{is a very difficult}} task. Using one biometric feature, i. e. the photograph or the sound of the voice, leads to good results, but there is no reliable way to verify the classification. In order to reach robust identification and verification we are combining three different biometric cues. These cues are dynamic, i. e. the sound of the voice and the lip motion, and static, i. e. the fixed image of the face. Each branch is preprocessed and classified separately and the results are combined, e. g. in a 2 -from- 3 manner. The recognition of persons may be used for pure identification or can be varied to a verification system. For both cases we have done a field test to show that this approach leads to a reliable person <b>authentification</b> system...|$|E

40|$|The Vietnamese in Britain are a {{small and}} less visible {{community}} who remain largely unrecognised in wider society. For those born in Britain, constructing a Vietnamese identity {{and a sense of}} ethnic belonging is often rendered problematic {{due to a lack of}} inclusion in, and identification with, their local Vietnamese community. Instead, ‘return’ visits to Vietnam occupy a particularly important space in their narratives of ethnic <b>authentification.</b> Drawing upon the literature on migrant-homeland relations, this paper highlights the importance of divisions of gender, class and migration trajectories in understanding patterns of transnational participation and engagement among Vietnamese migrants. It is argued that British-born Vietnamese women are more likely to engage actively in their ‘return’ visits and make personal and emotional investments compared to their male counterparts whose visits remain largely symbolic. These differences are shaped by social class configurations and gender expectations both in Britain and Vietnam. However, while ‘return’ visits provide more effective ethnic <b>authentification</b> strategies for women than men who experience a more compromised masculine status and negative experiences in the ‘homeland’, paradoxically their class differences with the majority of the population weakens and questions this authenticity leading to an ‘arrested’ achievement of ethnic authenticity...|$|E
