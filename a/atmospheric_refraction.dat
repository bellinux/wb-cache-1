Therefore, because the {{adaptive optics}} system is measuring the wavefront distortion in one wavelength range and the science observations are performed at a different wavelength range, residual image motion occurs and the maximum exposure time before smearing of the image can be significantly limited.

40|$|Abstract—In most {{adaptive}} algorithms, it {{is generally}} assumed that one knows the direction of arrival (DOA) of the signal of interest (SOI) through the steering vector of the array and {{the goal is to}} estimate its complex amplitude in the presence of jammer, clutter and noise. In space-time adaptive processing (STAP) the goal is to seek for a target located along a certain look direction and at a particular Doppler frequency through a given steering vector. Therefore, the accuracy of the computed results in either case is based on the reliability of this a priori assumption of the steering vector. It is possible that due to mechanical vibrations, calibration errors or <b>atmospheric</b> <b>refractions</b> of the incident electromagnetic waves, the assumed DOA may not be very accurate or that the assumed value of the Doppler frequency is not appropriate. In either of these cases, the adaptive algorithm treats the SOI as an interferer and nulls it out. This perennial problem of signal cancellation is an open problem for adaptive algorithms. In this paper It is shown that the proper steering vector occurs at the minimum of the sum of the norm of the adaptive weights and can be used as an indicator to refine the estimate of the DOA of the SOI in adaptive algorithms or both the DOA or/and the Doppler frequency in STAP. Examples are presented to illustrate that the secondary processing outlined in this paper, may provide a refined estimate for the true DOA or/and Doppler frequency for the SOI in the presence of interference, clutter and noise.

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} tests is gravitational lensing. It has been observed in distant astrophysical sources, but these are poorly controlled and it is uncertain how they constrain general relativity. The most precise tests are analogous to Eddington's 1919 experiment: they measure the deflection of radiation from a distant source by the Sun. The sources that can be most precisely analyzed are distant radio sources. In particular, some quasars are very strong radio sources. The directional resolution of any telescope is in principle limited by diffraction; for radio telescopes this is also the practical limit. An important improvement in obtaining positional high accuracies (from milli-arcsecond to micro-arcsecond) was obtained by combining radio telescopes across Earth. The technique is called very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). With this technique radio observations couple the phase information of the radio signal observed in telescopes separated over large distances. Recently, these telescopes have measured the deflection of radio waves by the Sun to extremely high precision, confirming the amount of deflection predicted by general relativity aspect to the 0.03% level. At this level of precision systematic effects have to be carefully taken into account to determine the precise location of the telescopes on Earth. Some important effects are Earth's nutation, rotation, <b>atmospheric</b> <b>refraction,</b> tectonic displacement and tidal waves. Another important effect is refraction of the radio waves by the solar corona. Fortunately, this effect has a characteristic spectrum, whereas gravitational distortion is independent of wavelength. Thus, careful analysis, using measurements at several frequencies, can subtract this source of error.|$|E

In it, Kepler described the inverse-square law governing the intensity of light, reflection by flat and curved mirrors, and principles of pinhole cameras, as well as the astronomical implications of optics such as parallax and the apparent sizes of heavenly bodies. He also extended his study of optics to the human eye, and is generally considered by neuroscientists {{to be the first to}} recognize that images are projected inverted and reversed by the eye's lens onto the retina. The solution to this dilemma was not of particular importance to Kepler as he did not see it as pertaining to optics, although he did suggest that the image was later corrected [...] "in the hollows of the brain" [...] due to the [...] "activity of the Soul." [...] Today, Astronomiae Pars Optica is generally recognized as the foundation of modern optics (though the law of refraction is conspicuously absent). With respect to the beginnings of projective geometry, Kepler introduced the idea of continuous change of a mathematical entity in this work. He argued that if a focus of a conic section were allowed to move along the line joining the foci, the geometric form would morph or degenerate, one into another. In this way, an ellipse becomes a parabola when a focus moves toward infinity, and when two foci of an ellipse merge into one another, a circle is formed. As the foci of a hyperbola merge into one another, the hyperbola becomes a pair of straight lines. He also assumed that if a straight line is extended to infinity it will meet itself at a single point at infinity, thus having the properties of a large circle.|$|E

Ptolemy quotes an equinox timing by Hipparchus (at 24 March 146 at dawn) that differs by 5 hours from the observation made on Alexandria's large public equatorial ring that same day (at 1 hour before noon): Hipparchus may have visited Alexandria but he did not make his equinox observations there; presumably he was on Rhodes (at nearly the same geographical longitude). He could have used the equatorial ring of his armillary sphere or another equatorial ring for these observations, but Hipparchus (and Ptolemy) knew that observations with these instruments are sensitive to a precise alignment with the equator, so if he were restricted to an armillary, it would make more sense to use its meridian ring as a transit instrument.
