5|$|Sri Aurobindo <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> divine Brahman manifests as {{empirical}} reality through līlā, or divine play. Instead of positing {{that the}} world we experience is an illusion (māyā), Aurobindo <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> world can evolve and become a new world with new species, far above the human species just as human species have evolved after the animal species.|$|E
5|$|Arias-Maldonado <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> {{traditional}} {{appeals to}} the value of nonhuman animals have failed to be sufficiently motivating, and that, instead, human/nonhuman relationships are appropriately grounded upon the ideas of human exceptionalism and human domination. These notions, he claims, can be the basis of political transformation for nonhuman animals. He <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> once these ideas are properly understood, they can ground an idea of human sympathy for nonhuman animals, which is just one part of a caring and sustainable Anthropocene. Even if an alternative politics might ultimately be preferable, Arias-Maldonado argues, a change to a focus on sympathy might be useful and realistic as a political strategy.|$|E

50|$|The {{topic of}} single-sex {{education}} is controversial. Advocates <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> it aids student outcomes such as test scores, graduation rates, and solutions to behavioral difficulties. Opponents, however, <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> evidence for such effects is inflated or non-existent, and instead <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> such segregation can increase sexism and impairs {{the development of}} interpersonal skills.|$|R
50|$|Woolgar and Pawluch <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> constructionsts tend to 'ontological gerrymander' social {{conditions}} {{in and out}} of their analysis. Following this point, Thibodeaux <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> constructionism can both separate and combine a subject and their effective environment. To resolve this he <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> objective conditions should be used when analyzing how perspectives are motivated.|$|R
5|$|Dava Sobel <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> {{prior to}} Galileo's 1633 trial and {{judgement}} for heresy, Pope Urban VIII had become preoccupied with court intrigue {{and problems of}} state, and began to fear persecution or threats to his own life. In this context, Sobel <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> the problem of Galileo {{was presented to the}} pope by court insiders and enemies of Galileo. Having been accused of weakness in defending the church, Urban reacted against Galileo out of anger and fear.|$|E

5|$|Hadley has {{considered}} {{the ethics of}} humans' relationships with wild animals and environments beyond his property rights theory. He <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> there is a duty to aid wild animals in need, and that these duties are essentially no different to humans' duties to aid distant strangers who are severely cognitively impaired. He <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> libertarian property rights, consistent with Robert Nozick's interpretation of the Lockean proviso, should limit the right to destroy human-owned natural environments.|$|E

First, I <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> some theories of causation.

50|$|During the campaign, {{supporters}} of the draft constitution <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the constitution would provide stability. Most opponents <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the constitution was too favorable to the Muslim Brotherhood, and did not grant sufficient minority rights. However, some extreme Salafists also opposed the constitution, <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> {{it should have been}} based more closely on Sharia law.|$|R
5|$|Hiltebeitel <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> the Kuttantavar cult might {{represent}} the original Tamil tradition regarding Aravan, {{however it is}} no longer the only tradition that venerates Aravan. The Draupadi cult has developed traditions and rituals of its own.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the issue}} of peace {{negotiations}} with the Taliban Naeem <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{certain parts of the}} Taliban want peace and could be compromised with. Sultanzoy <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the Taliban was a tool of foreign intelligence agencies, and that in order to marginalize the Taliban the Afghan people needed to unite behind a unifying goal. Hilal <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the Taliban was a diverse group, with certain members being driven by poverty, whilst others were [...] "agents of intelligence agencies." [...] Hilal <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the former parts could and should be negotiated with.

40|$|My {{argument}} {{for the use of}} international materials to interpret the Constitutional will proceed in four parts. First, I will <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> international law has a venerable history in constitutional interpretation. Second, I will <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> American courts and foreign courts are engaged in a common legal enterprise and could learn from one another. Third, I will <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the text of certain constitutional provisions invites the use of international materials. Finally, I will <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> taking international opinion into account has strong pragmatic justifications...|$|R
50|$|In the {{subsequent}} socialist calculation debates, a dichotomy between socialists emerged {{between those who}} <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> socialization entailed the end of monetary valuation and capital markets, and those who <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> monetary prices could be used within a socialized economy. A further distinction arose between market socialists who <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> social ownership can be achieved {{within the context of}} a market economy, where worker-owned or publicly owned enterprises maximized profit, and those who <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> socially owned enterprises operate according to other criteria, like marginal cost pricing.|$|R
5|$|James Morris {{notes that}} Hick's eschatological {{verification}} {{theory has been}} criticised for being inconsistent with his belief in religious pluralism. Morris <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> such criticism can be overcome by modifying Hick's parable to include multiple travellers, all with different beliefs, on the road. He <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> even if some beliefs about life after death are unverifiable, Hick's belief in bodily resurrection can still be verified.|$|E

5000|$|Criticisms of the {{doctrine}} continue as in the past. Critics <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> judges are making determinations of policy and morality that properly belong with legislators (i.e. [...] "legislating from the bench"), or <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> judges are reading views into the Constitution that are not really implied by the document, or <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> judges are claiming power to expand the liberty of some people {{at the expense of}} other people's liberty (e.g. as in the Dred Scott case), or <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> judges are addressing substance instead of process.|$|R

5|$|Philosopher G. H. R. Parkinson notes {{a common}} {{objection}} to Kant's argument: that {{what ought to}} be done does not necessarily entail that it is possible. He also <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> alternative conceptions of morality exist which do not rely on the assumptions that Kant makes – he cites utilitarianism as an example which does not require the summum bonum. Nicholas Everitt <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> much moral guidance is unattainable, such as the Biblical command to be Christ-like. He proposes that Kant's first two premises only entail that we must try to achieve the perfect good, not that it is actually attainable.|$|E
5|$|Process {{theology}} <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> God is not omnipotent: {{rather than}} coercion, {{he has the}} power of divine persuasion, but he cannot force his will. Griffin, a prominent process theologian, <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> God feels {{the pain of the}} world (both physically and emotionally) and does everything within his power to achieve good, but he can neither force beings to be good nor prevent evil because he does not play a coercive role in the world. Process theology teaches that, rather than creating the world ex nihilo (as Augustine proposed), God created it out of a pre-existent chaos.|$|E

The author asserts that censorship of works deemed obscene {{has been used as a}} tactic throughout history to suppress women's rights. Heins <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> even if the perceived negative impacts of pornography,hip hop music, and violent films were factually accurate (and she asserts they are not), the ends would not justify the means of degrading the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. She emphasizes that education should be used to help guard against potentially dangerous notions, instead of censorship and suppression of dissent.|$|E
