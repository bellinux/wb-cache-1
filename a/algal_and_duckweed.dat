40|$|Abstract: The use of eco-technologies for {{wastewater}} treatment such as algal and duckweed-based pond systems is becoming popular {{in developing countries}} owing to its affordability and efficiency of pathogen removal in warm climates. The pathogen removal mechanisms of these treatment systems however is still not clearly understood and existing knowledge is also scattered in journals and books of different disciplines. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to provide a concise review of knowledge acquired in recent times on faecal coliform removal mechanisms in <b>algal</b> <b>and</b> <b>duckweed</b> ponds in a comparative way while identifying knowledge gaps that still exist. This review pays particular attention to little known removal mechanisms such as the role of algal biomass, attachment and sedimentation of faecal coliforms and the role of predation by macro-invertebrates and protozoans. Recent experiments showed that algal ponds, in comparison with duckweed ponds, are more efficient in faecal coliform removal due to the high pH and oxygenation that occur in the former an...|$|E
40|$|The reuse of {{domestic}} wastewater presents many challenges including {{the risk of}} pathogen infection; hence the removal of pathogens from domestic wastewater is very relevant. It is known that algae {{play a crucial role}} in the process of their removal by raising the pH and dissolved oxygen concentration which tend to be injurious to bacteria. It is however not known how algal disinfection ability is affected by biomass changes in sewage of varying strengths and whether algae contribute in sedimenting faecal coliforms (FC) from the water column through attachment to their surfaces. Experiments were conducted to investigate the importance of FC attachment to algae, the effect of varying concentration of algae in sewage of different strengths on FC removal and the effect of algae on FC removal in a tropical eutrophic lake. The effect of reducing algal densities in a pilot-scale hybrid algae-duckweed pond system on FC removal was also investigated with the aim of understanding the importance of FC attachment in such a treatment system in relation to pure <b>algal</b> <b>and</b> <b>duckweed</b> treatment lines. Algae helped in sedimenting FC to the bottom of reactors. It was shown by experimentation under laboratory conditions that in domestic wastewater treatment an optimum algal density exists at which maximum FC removal is achieved. Algae were also important in significantly reducing Escherichia coli contamination in a eutrophic lake through increased oxygenation and pH elevation. At algal density ≤ 0. 08 mgL- 1 in the Weija Lake, decay rate of E. coli was directly proportional to the chlorophyll a concentration of the lake. The strength {{of domestic}} wastewater undergoing treatment may also affect the rate of decay of FC, particularly as algal concentration changes. In darkness, higher algal biomass (or chlorophyll a concentration) resulted in higher inactivation of FC although dissolved oxygen concentration and pH were low suggesting a role by another factor in the inactivation of FC. At algal densities ≥ 13. 9 mg L- 1 higher removal of FC occurred in MSW (medium strength wastewater) compared with LSW (low strength wastewater) whether in light or in darkness. The highest rate of decay in LSW occurred at 3. 2 mgL- 1 chlorophyll a concentration in light while that of the MSW occurred at 20. 0 mgL- 1 in light. Addition of raw wastewater to an ongoing wastewater treatment process lowered the rate of FC removal for a wide range of algal densities (0. 6 – 19. 6 mgL- 1 chlorophyll a concentration), under light conditions. The hybrid pond system performed well in FC (4. 3 log units) and Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) (89 %) removal and these parameters in addition to total phosphorus were not affected by seasonal changes. FC attachment to suspended matter was important only in the first two ponds of the duckweed, algal and hybrid pond systems. Little variation of FC decay with depth was observed. FC decay rates in the mornings were usually lower than in the afternoons in algal ponds but not in the duckweed ponds. High densities of macro-invertebrates belonging to the class Ostracoda were associated mainly with the surface and bottom of duckweed ponds and these were much higher than that of algal ponds at similar locations. FC numbers in duckweed ponds correlated strongly and positively with mean ostracod numbers in ponds. FC numbers also correlated well with Shannon-Wiener diversity index of macro-invertebrates in all the three pond systems. Integrating a hybrid pond system such as this for aquaculture would be a big boost economically and health-wise for communities in developing countries with warm tropical conditions...|$|E

40|$|Industrial {{wastewater}} {{contains many}} pollutants in general. Our interest {{is focusing on}} heavy metals found in textile effluents because of their known toxicity effect in the environment. Wastewater from a textile industry (UTEXRWA) in Rwanda has been screened for the occurrence of Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn. Batch and pilot experiments on adsorption equilibrium, kinetics and sulfide precipitation using volcanic rock as adsorbent and packing material have been investigated. A low cost and integrated system for treatment has been developed; combining an anaerobic bioreactor as main treatment step followed by a polishing step composed by a polishing pond containing algae, <b>duckweed</b> <b>and</b> water hyacinth. More than 90 % of metal removal was achieved in the bioreactor, with metal sulfide precipitation as long term removal mechanism. The use of algae <b>and</b> <b>duckweed</b> as alternative for water hyacinth plants showed no differences between algae <b>and</b> <b>duckweed</b> ponds based on abiotic differences.

40|$|Many {{pollutants}} {{have received}} significant attention {{due to their}} potential estrogenic effect and are classified as endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). Because of possible ecological effects and increased attention for water reuse schemes, {{it is important to}} increase our understanding of the EDC removal capacities of various wastewater treatment systems. However, there has so far been little research on the fate and behavior of EDCs in stabilization pond systems for wastewater treatment, which represent an important class of wastewater treatment systems in developing countries because of their cost-effectiveness. The aim of this work is to study the fate and behavior of EDCs in algae <b>and</b> <b>duckweed</b> ponds. Because the synthetic hormone 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE 2) and the natural hormones estrone (E 1), as well as 17 beta-estradiol (E 2), have been detected in effluents of sewage treatment plants and been suggested as the major compounds responsible for endocrine disruption in domestic sewage; E 1, E 2, and EE 2 were therefore chosen as target chemicals in this current work. Both batch tests and continuous-flow tests were carried out to investigate the sorption and biodegradation of estrogens in algae <b>and</b> <b>duckweed</b> pond systems. The applied duckweed was a Lemna species. The applied algae was a mixture of pure cultures of six different algae genera, i. e., Anabaena cylindrica, Chlorococcus, Spirulina platensis, Chlorella, Scenedesmus quadricauda, and Anaebena var. Synthetic wastewater were used in all tests. The concentrations of estrogens were measured with three different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits specific for E 1, E 2, or EE 2. When the concentrations of estrogens in water samples were below the lowest quantitative analysis range (0. 05 A mu g/l), preconcentration of the water samples were performed by means of solid phase extraction (SPE) with C 18 cartridges. The 6 -day batch tests show that the presence of algae or duckweed accelerated the removal of the three estrogens from the synthetic wastewater. More estrogens were removed in the tests with duckweed than in tests with algae or with wastewater. In the sorption tests, a swift sorption of the three estrogens was observed when the estrogens were contacted with duckweed or algae, while the estrogen concentrations in tap water kept unchanged during the 3 -h sorption tests. The mass balances indicated that only about 5 % of the estrogens were bound to the algae sediment or duckweed {{at the end of the}} 6 -day tests. Results of the continuous-flow tests revealed that the algae <b>and</b> <b>duckweed</b> ponds effectively removed E 1, E 2, and EE 2 even at nanograms per liter level. Interconversion of E 1 and E 2 occurred both in batch and continuous-flow tests. E 2 could be readily transformed to E 1, especially in the tests with algae. Different processes like sorption, biodegradation and photolytic degradation might play an important role in the removal of estrogens from the aquatic phase. The 3 -h sorption tests support the importance of sorption for estrogen removal, in which a rapid initial sorption was observed over the first 2 min for E 1 /E 2 /EE 2 to both <b>duckweed</b> <b>and</b> algae. In the 6 -day batch tests, estrogens were sorbed by algae or duckweed during the early stage when algae <b>and</b> <b>duckweed</b> were contacted with the synthetic wastewater and the sorbed estrogens were further biodegraded by the microorganisms developed in the wastewater. The persistent estrogen concentrations in tap water, however, implied that no sorption, biodegradation, or photolytic degradation occurred in tap water under the specific experimental conditions. Under aerobic or anoxic conditions, E 2 could be first oxidized to E 1, which is further oxidized to unknown metabolites and finally to CO(2) and water. Under anaerobic conditions, E 1 can also be reduced to E 2. However, the interconversion might be much more complex especially in the tests with algae because both aerobic and anaerobic conditions occurred in these tests due to the variation of the dissolved oxygen concentration induced by the light regime. This study shows that estrogens, E 1, E 2, and EE 2, can be effectively removed from the continuous-flow algae <b>and</b> <b>duckweed</b> ponds even when their concentrations are at nanograms per liter level. The presence of algae <b>and</b> <b>duckweed</b> accelerate the removal of estrogens from the synthetic wastewater because estrogens can be quickly sorbed on duckweed or algae. The sorbed estrogens are subsequently degraded by microorganisms, algae, or duckweed in the wastewater treatment system. E 1 and E 2 are interconvertible in both <b>duckweed</b> <b>and</b> algae pond systems. E 2 can be readily transformed to E 1, especially in the tests with algae. Based on the tests performed so far, one can conclude that both sorption and biodegradation are important to the estrogens removal from stabilization pond systems for wastewater treatment. Further research using, e. g., radioimmunoassay is needed to investigate the biodegradation pathway of estrogens in algae <b>and</b> <b>duckweed</b> ponds...|$|R

40|$|Finding an {{alternative}} to fishmeal and fish oil in animal feeds has been a topic of increasing interest due to the pressures being put on the ocean’s fisheries and the increasing world demand for animal protein.

One third of all food produced globally ends up in landfills, wasting a huge amount of nutrients and embodied energy that could otherwise be redirected towards productive use.

30|$|The ecology {{unit was}} {{represented}} by activities 5, 6, and 7, where students modeled a closed fish tank system in two phases. In the first phase (activity 5), students constructed a macro-level, semi-stable model of the fish tank ecosystem by modeling the fish <b>and</b> <b>duckweed</b> species as two agent types. Activity 5 required students to model the food chain, respiration, locomotion, excretion, and the reproductive behaviors for the fish <b>and</b> <b>duckweed.</b> The inability to develop a sustained macro-model, where the fish <b>and</b> the <b>duckweed</b> could be kept alive for extended periods of time, even though all of the macro processes associated with the two agents were correctly modeled (that is, the behaviors generated by the students’ computational model matched the behaviors generated by the expert model), encouraged students to reflect on what may be missing from the macro-model. This led to the realization {{about the need to}} model the waste cycle and its entities, primarily the two forms of bacteria and their behaviors. This prompted the transition to the second phase (activity 6) where students identified the continuously increasing fish waste as the culprit for the lack of sustainability of the fish tank. Students then built the waste cycle model for the fish tank, with the Nitrosomonas bacteria that converts the toxic ammonia in fish waste into nitrites, which is also toxic, and the Nitrobacter bacteria that converts the nitrites into nitrates. Nitrates are consumed by the duckweed (as nutrients) thus preventing an excessive buildup of toxic chemicals in the fish tank environment. The combination of graphs from the micro- and macro-world visualizations was intended to help the students develop an aggregate-level understanding of the interdependence and balance among the different agents (fish, <b>duckweed,</b> <b>and</b> bacteria) in the system. After completing the ecology micro-unit, students worked on activity 7 where they discussed the combined micro-macro model with their assigned researcher and how the macro-micro model phenomena could be combined into an aggregated causal model describing the sustainability of the fish tank ecosystem.|$|R

Sharp dock was found to be a good accumulator of N and P. Indeed, on a dry weight basis the shoots of sharp dock accumulated up to 6. 4 % of N and 1. 1 % of P with BCF (bioconcentration factor) values of 2235 and 1568, respectively. Water hyacinth <b>and</b> <b>duckweed</b> strongly accumulated Cd with concentrations of 462 and 14200 mg/kg, respectively, and BCF values of 1225 and 2567, respectively.
