5000|$|On 13 May 1908, the Naval Appropriations Bill {{was signed}} by President Theodore Roosevelt which {{established}} the Navy Nurse Corps. The nucleus of the new Navy Nurse Corps was Esther Hasson the superintendent and Lenah Higbee the Chief Nurse and eighteen other women. They {{became known as the}} [...] "Sacred Twenty." [...] Della V. Knight was one of these original nurses. They had no quarters of their own and were given an <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> <b>quarters</b> and subsistence to rent a house and establish their own mess. They found themselves not welcomed in an environment that was considered a male domain. Their original quarters was on 21st Street, N.W., {{a few blocks from the}} Naval Hospital.|$|E

30|$|A {{last point}} {{worthy of note}} is the {{possible}} heterogeneity in the policy effect across periods. In particular, the policy {{may be more effective}} as time goes on or, on the other hand, the effect may be stronger just after the announcement of the policy, then phases out with the passing of time. In order to see whether the policy effect is quarter- and/or year-specific, three specifications are estimated based on the empirical strategy just outlined above. First, the policy effect is imposed to be constant across quarters over the period. More specifically, there is no <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> <b>quarter</b> and year specific dummies, and the comparison is between the entire period after the policy introduction and the entire period before the policy. This specification is called “period specific” policy effect. Next, the policy effect is imposed to be constant across quarters within a year, but allowing for variation between years by introducing year specific dummies for the policy period. This specification enables the estimation of the policy effect for each year over the policy period. Thirdly, an <b>allowance</b> is made <b>for</b> heterogeneous policy effect across quarters by including year specific quarter dummies. This time the comparison is between each quarter within the policy period and the entire period before the policy intervention. This most flexible specification provides separate estimates of the policy effect <b>for</b> each <b>quarter</b> over the policy period 15. Furthermore, each quarter within the policy period is compared to the corresponding quarter in the pre-policy period in order to test the role of seasonality in policy effectiveness.|$|R
25|$|Ordinary {{income is}} a net income concept, {{meaning that it}} will be {{deduction}} for costs incurred to acquire income. There is therefore a deduction for expenses related to acquisition of income if these are higher than the basic allowance. There is also several other deductions from ordinary income; special <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> disability, special tax <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> pensioners, the tax limitation rule for the disabled, seamen’s allowance, fishermen’s <b>allowance,</b> special <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> self-employed within agriculture, special <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> high expenses linked to illness, <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> payments to individual pension schemes, <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> travel between home and work, <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> donations to voluntary organisations, <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> paid union fees, <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> home investment savings scheme for people under 34 years, parental <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> documented expenses for childminding and childcare, etc.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimited. A regression model {{is used by}} the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) to predict median rents so as to find variable housing allowance (VHA) as a supplement to Basic <b>Allowance</b> <b>for</b> <b>Quarters</b> (BAQ). These allowances are made for service members in the continental United States. It is this model that is reviewed in this theses. Median rental data taken from the annual VHA survey are used to test this model. From this analysis, the model indicates lack of fit, invalid assumptions and perhaps not even a 'resonable' approach. A more sensible approach is used to propose two other regression models. These models are a Weighted Regression Model which, like the current model, predicts medians; and an Analysis of Covariance model which predicts or analyzes the mean rent. More reasonable predictions of median and mean rent are indicated by these two models respectively. Lieutenant, United States Naval Reserv...|$|E

30|$|In {{the pilot}} ETSs in China, a {{majority}} of <b>allowances</b> are allocated <b>for</b> free, with a relatively small portion being auctioned in Shenzhen and Guangdong. Grandfathering is applied to allocate <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> cogeneration units in Guangdong, and benchmarking is adopted to allocate <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> coal-fired and gas-fired units in Shanghai. As China has a steadily growing economy, a benchmarking method based on actual output (rather than historical output) is planned to allocate <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> generation companies in the national level ETS, in order to balance emission reduction and economic growth.|$|R
40|$|Privatization of Military Family Housing {{will place}} a greater {{reliance}} on private sector rental housing. Before the DoD embarks on any policy changes that place {{a greater emphasis}} on private sector housing, the DoD must be certain that rental property landlords do not raise rental prices based on changes in a service member's housing allowances. This thesis explores the relationship between changes in military housing allowances and changes in private sector rental prices. A multiple regression model was used to determine this correlation. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Fair Market Rent data was used to measure the changes in private sector rent prices in 25 cities. Basic <b>Allowance</b> <b>for</b> <b>Quarters</b> (BAQ), Variable Housing Allowance (VHA) rates, and a ratio that measured the presence of military members in a given area were used as the independent variables. Using the three independent variables described above, the result did confirm the popular impression that rent prices do rise with increases in housing allowances. However, the correlation was not as significant as anticipated. In an effort to make the model more useful as a policy tool, recommendations are provided for an expanded dependent variable data source and additional independent variables. NAU. S. Navy (U. S.

30|$|Third, auctions {{should be}} {{introduced}} into the <b>allowance</b> allocation <b>for</b> takers. In China, Guangdong is the first and currently the only pilot province to introduce auctions into the allowance allocation. After the first pilot year (July 2013 –July 2014), the compliance rate of enterprises and the allowance on CO 2 emissions reduction achieved 98.90 and 99.97  %, respectively. In the Guangdong industrial sectors, the enterprises must acquire a 3  % allowance through auction, and they can then activate a 97  % <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> free; for large public buildings, 100  % are allocated for free by benchmarking before the compliance period. At present, the government-allocated <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the enterprises is free in Beijing. However, the CET will eventually be completely adjusted by the market, {{as is the case}} for CET in the EU (European Union). Specifically, a certain level of auction, such as 3  %, can be introduced to the <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the takers; and a lesser amount for auction, which should be smaller than the proportion of auction in the <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the takers, can be introduced to the <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the givers; alternatively, 100  % can be free <b>for</b> the <b>allowance</b> of the givers.|$|R

5000|$|Emissions allocation: Under the Clear Skies Act, {{emission}} allowances are to {{be allocated}} based on historical fuel consumption, what {{is often referred to}} as [...] "grandfathering". Under the Clean Air Planning Act, a grandfathering approach is used to allocate emission <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> SO2, but <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> NOx, mercury, and CO2, are allocated using an output-based scheme. Under this approach, referred to as a generation performance standard (GPS), generators are given <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> each unit of electricity they generate. The number of <b>allowances</b> allocated <b>for</b> each unit of generation changes each year as the total generation from covered sources changes. The use of a GPS dampens the electricity price impacts of the bill but raises overall compliance costs.|$|R
