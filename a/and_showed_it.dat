5|$|After the {{financial}} success of Saw, a sequel was immediately green-lit. Leigh Whannell and James Wan were busy preparing {{for their next}} film and were unable to write or direct. Bousman wrote a script called The Desperate before Saw was released and {{was looking for a}} producer but many studios rejected it. Hoffman received the script <b>and</b> <b>showed</b> <b>it</b> to his partners Mark Burg and Oren Koules. It was decided that, with some changes, it could be made into Saw II. Whannell became available to provide rewrites of the script. The film was given a larger budget and was shot from May to June 2005 in Toronto.|$|E

During this time, Chase considered asking HBO for additional funding to shoot 45 more minutes of footage and release The Sopranos as a feature film. In December 1997, HBO decided to produce the series and ordered 12 more episodes for a 13-episode season.|$|E

5|$|Further work {{concentrated}} on characterizing {{the structures of}} the antibody proteins. A major advance in these structural studies was the discovery in the early 1960s by Gerald Edelman and Joseph Gally of the antibody light chain, and their realization that this protein {{is the same as}} the Bence-Jones protein described in 1845 by Henry Bence Jones. Edelman went on to discover that antibodies are composed of disulfide bond-linked heavy and light chains. Around the same time, antibody-binding (Fab) and antibody tail (Fc) regions of IgG were characterized by Rodney Porter. Together, these scientists deduced the structure and complete amino acid sequence of IgG, a feat for which they were jointly awarded the 1972 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The Fv fragment was prepared and characterized by David Givol. While most of these early studies focused on IgM and IgG, other immunoglobulin isotypes were identified in the 1960s: Thomas Tomasi discovered secretory antibody (IgA); David S. Rowe and John L. Fahey discovered IgD; and Kimishige Ishizaka and Teruko Ishizaka discovered IgE <b>and</b> <b>showed</b> <b>it</b> was a class of antibodies involved in allergic reactions. In a landmark series of experiments beginning in 1976, Susumu Tonegawa showed that genetic material can rearrange itself to form the vast array of available antibodies.|$|E
5|$|In 1669, the Jewels went {{on public}} {{display in the}} Jewel House at the Tower of London. The Deputy Keeper of the Jewel House took the regalia out of a {{cupboard}} <b>and</b> <b>showed</b> <b>it</b> to visitors for a small fee. This informal arrangement was ended two years later when Colonel Thomas Blood, an Irish-born army officer loyal to Parliament, attacked the 77-year-old and, {{with the help of}} three accomplices, stole a crown, a sceptre and an orb. They were apprehended at the perimeter, and the items were recovered, though some had been damaged: the crown was flattened with a mallet in an attempt to conceal it, and there was a dent in the orb. Blood was not only pardoned, but also given land and a pension. It has been suggested that he was a government spy. Ever since, the Jewels have been protected by armed guards.|$|E

When the Argentine ship was going to repel the enemy's boarding, the schooner took out the Spanish flag <b>and</b> <b>showed</b> <b>it</b> was a Chilean ship, called Chileno (Chilean).

25|$|However, Aurelian {{never reached}} Persia, {{as he was}} murdered while waiting in Thrace to cross into Asia Minor. As an administrator, Aurelian had been very strict and handed out severe punishments to corrupt {{officials}} or soldiers. A secretary of Aurelian (called Eros by Zosimus) had told a lie on a minor issue. In fear of what the Emperor might do, he forged a document listing the names of high officials marked by the emperor for execution <b>and</b> <b>showed</b> <b>it</b> to collaborators. The notarius Mucapor and other high-ranking officers of the Praetorian Guard, fearing punishment from the Emperor, murdered him in September 275, in Caenophrurium, Thrace (modern Turkey).|$|E
25|$|The {{inspector}} of the Nationalsingspiel was Gottlieb Stephanie. When the 25-year-old Mozart {{arrived in}} Vienna in 1781, seeking professional opportunity, {{one of the}} first tasks to which he addressed himself was to become acquainted with Stephanie and lobby him for an opera commission. To this end, he brought a copy of his earlier opera Zaide <b>and</b> <b>showed</b> <b>it</b> to Stephanie, who was duly impressed. Mozart also made a strong impression on the manager of the theater, Count Franz Xaver Orsini-Rosenberg, when in the home of Mozart's friend and patroness Maria Wilhelmine Thun the Count heard him play excerpts from his opera Idomeneo, premiered with great success the previous year in Munich. With this backing, it was agreed that Stephanie would find appropriate material and prepare a libretto for Mozart. Stephanie complied by preparing an altered version of an earlier work Belmont und Constanze, oder Die Entführung aus dem Serail without attributing or seeking permission from its original author Christoph Friedrich Bretzner. Bretzner later complained loudly and publicly about the theft.|$|E

500|$|Bill Moffat, a {{headmaster}} from Glasgow, had an {{idea for}} a children's television programme called The Norbridge Files. He showed it to a producer who visited his school, Thorn Primary School in Johnstone, Renfrewshire, when it was used as the location for an episode of Harry Secombe's Highway. Producer Sandra C. Hastie liked the idea <b>and</b> <b>showed</b> <b>it</b> to her future husband Bill Ward, co-owner of her company Richmond Films and Television. When she requested a script, Moffat suggested that his 25-year-old son Steven, an English teacher, should write it. Hastie said that it was [...] "the best ever first script" [...] that she had read.|$|E
500|$|When Max Allan Collins {{wrote the}} graphic novel Road to Perdition, his book agent saw {{potential}} in the story as a film adaptation <b>and</b> <b>showed</b> <b>it</b> to a film agent. By 1999, the novel had reached Dean Zanuck, who was {{the vice president of}} development at the company owned [...] by his father, producer Richard D. Zanuck. The novel was sent to the elder Zanuck in Morocco, who was there producing Rules of Engagement (2000). The Zanucks agreed on the story's prospect and sent it to director-producer Steven Spielberg. Shortly afterward, Spielberg set up the project at his studio DreamWorks, though he did not pursue direction of the film due to his full slate.|$|E

Because it was Lolol's payday, the streets of the town were full of people. The teenagers eventually found a policeman, Sergeant Felipe González, who quickly got to the crime scene. In the meantime, López had taken Reyes' head <b>and</b> <b>showed</b> <b>it</b> to passers-by, raising the severed head [...] "like a trophy". When González reached him, he ordered López to stop and fired into the air twice without receiving any response from López. [...] López then rushed towards the policeman with the bloody ax he had used to decapitate Reyes Moore, forcing González to shoot him with his service weapon, killing him.|$|E

When Manson discovered he was uncredited on the single, he was furious and threatened Dennis Wilson with murder. Beach Boys collaborator Van Dyke Parks recalled [...] "One day, Charles Manson brought a bullet out <b>and</b> <b>showed</b> <b>it</b> to Dennis, who asked, 'What's this?' And Manson replied, 'It's a bullet. Every time you look at it, I {{want you to think}} how nice it is your kids are still safe'".

500|$|In 1994, wealthy Japanese Raëlians {{rented a}} racecar <b>and</b> <b>showed</b> <b>it</b> to Raël. [...] They {{believed}} that if Raël would race it, it would generate publicity for the movement. [...] Raël accepted the offer {{on the condition that}} the funding not come from member tithes or embassy funding. [...] Funding for Raël's races, which took place in the 1990s and early 2000s, came mostly from well-funded European and Japanese people. His best finishes included [...] "a 3rd place finish in GT 1 in Lime Rock with the Mosler Raptor in 1997, and a 7th place finish at Watkins Glen with a Viper GTS R in the FIA GT 1999 race". Raël participated in the 1999 BFGoodrich Tires Trans-Am Series and the 2000 Speedvision GT Championship.

500|$|The {{success of}} Dónde Están los Ladrones? {{prompted}} American singer Gloria Estefan, Emilio Estefan's wife, to persuade Shakira {{to record the}} album in English and attempt to crossover into the mainstream pop industry. However, Shakira was initially hesitant to record songs in English as it was not her first language, so she offered to translate [...] "Ojos Así" [...] into English {{in order to show}} her that [...] "it could translate well". Shakira then began translating the song herself <b>and</b> <b>showed</b> <b>it</b> to Gloria Estefan, and would say, [...] "Quite honestly, I can't do this better!." [...] As Shakira wanted to have full control over her recordings, she decided to learn English better to enable her to write her own songs. She was supposed to return to studio to record an English version of the album in January 1999. It did not came to fruition, and a new album titled Laundry Service was released instead as her first crossover album.|$|E
