25|$|The {{investigation}} report {{stated that the}} weather conditions were a cause of the accident. During the approach to the runway the aircraft was operated slightly above the stall speed and {{a major change in}} wind speed could cause a stall. The aircraft experienced windshear. The altitude, the reaction time of the pilot, and the responsiveness of the aircraft combined to prevent the arrest of decent in time to avoid the accident. The crew did not adhere to any published approach procedure and they possibly misinterpreted the altimeter and airspeed indicator. During the descent, the pilot in command did not check his <b>approach</b> <b>chart</b> and did not continually consult the first officer on the altitude and course. There was inadequate communication between crew, deficient Crew Resource Management, and no approach briefings were made for either of the two approaches. The aircraft was configured for landing with flaps fully down at a very long distance from the runway without having it in sight. The aircraft will not respond well to windshear in such a configuration. Both approaches require a circling procedure.|$|E

50|$|This {{involves}} the simultaneous stimulation of two semicircular canals and {{is associated with}} a sudden tilting (forward or backwards) of the pilot's head while the aircraft is turning. This can occur when tilting the head down (to look at an <b>approach</b> <b>chart</b> or to write on the knee pad), or up (to look at an overhead instrument or switch) or sideways. This can produce an overpowering sensation that the aircraft is rolling, pitching, and yawing all at the same time, which can be compared with the sensation of rolling down a hillside. This illusion can make the pilot quickly become disoriented and lose control of the aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{also worth}} noting that {{earlier in the day}} a Merpati Nusantara Airlines Flight 152 was handled by same air traffic controller, this {{confusion}} led to the pilots not hearing the first call, in which the controller said [...] "Merpati one five two turn left heading 240 to intercept runway zero five from the right side", as the wrong callsign was used the pilots were not listening to these instructions. the controller on not receiving a response queried the pilots on if they heard the instructions, from this time with the correct callsign [...] "Indonesia 152" [...] was used, the controller then repeated his instructions though he did not say that the flight would be making its approach {{on the south side of}} the runway, or right side. The pilots believed they were flying the approach on the north side of the airport, as was the approach on the <b>approach</b> <b>chart</b> the pilots were using. Thus when the pilots were instructed to turn right to a heading of 046 maintaining 2,000 ft, to capture the Localizer for the ILS to runway 5, out of habit or possibly due to the <b>approach</b> <b>chart</b> the captain initiated a left turn to a heading of 046. The First officer was distracted during the turn and did not notice for a while that the aircraft was turning left, when he did notice, he told the captain he was turning the wrong way, and the captain questioned the controller over which way they needed to turn, to which the controller confirmed they were to turn right, a confusing conversation took place over which way to turn, with the controller not having a clear picture over what the flight was doing due the Medan radar system having a refresh time of 12 seconds.|$|E

We apply this approach to study variation in transcriptional responsiveness to pathogen components in dendritic cells from recombinant inbred mouse strains. We identify reQTLs that correlate with particular stimuli and position them in known pathways. For example, {{in response to a}} virus-like stimulus, a trans-acting variant responds as an activator of the antiviral response; using RNA interference, we identify Rgs 16 as the likely causal gene.
