50|$|In 2001, Fareless Square was {{extended}} again, this time {{across the river}} to the Lloyd District. Included were MAX stations along Holladay Street and bus stops on NE Multnomah Street from the Rose Quarter, past the Oregon Convention Center to the Lloyd Center shopping mall. This was a panhandle-shaped addition to the original free-fare zone, and consequently Fareless Square was, strictly speaking, no longer square-shaped, but it retained its name. In 2007, <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>stops</b> {{directly in front of}} Union Station, added with Portland Mall construction and north of Irving Street, were added to the zone.

5000|$|Winslow Road {{saw little}} {{passenger}} traffic, {{which may be}} attributed to its location a little over a mile from the village of Winslow which it purported to serve and which had its own conveniently-sited station on the Oxford to Bletchley line since May 1850. During 1939, work started on singling the line south of Winslow Road, with the double track left on a section from <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>stops</b> near the station to Verney Junction. The work was completed by 28 January 1940 and the line south of Winslow Road became effectively a long siding. Train crews operated the level crossing gates and all signalling was removed to make the route one section between two junctions. Freight traffic from the Oxford to Bletchley line was rerouted via a connecting spur near [...] which was brought into use on 14 September 1940, thereby allowing trains to work south over the Great Central Main Line.|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{a general}} form <b>of</b> optimal <b>stopping</b> {{problems}} in regime-switching models is studied under certain standard assumptions. An optimal stopping problem with an arbitrary value {{function in a}} two-regime environment {{can be reduced to}} <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> optimal <b>stopping</b> problems without regime switching. A method for finding optimal stopping rules is proposed using the techniques available for non-switching problems. In contrast to other methods, our systematic solution procedure is more direct since we first obtain the explicit form of the value functions. In the end, we discuss a problem which may not be dealt with by the conventional methods, demonstrating the computational simplicity of our approach...|$|R

40|$|The {{first part}} of this thesis investigates the {{optional}} sampling theorem for submartingales ~exed by a partially ordered time set. Although the optional sampling theorem is true for martingales indexed by partially ordered time under very general circumstances, the submartingale version requires one to restrict the stopping times to a special subclass <b>of</b> general <b>stopping</b> times. These special stopping times, which we call reachable, are defined in terms <b>of</b> a sequential <b>stopping</b> problem in the partially ordered time set. We show that the optional sampling theorem is generally true for submartingales and reachable stopping times. Conversely, if the optional sampling theorem is true for <b>a</b> given <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>stopping</b> times and all submartingales, then these stopping times must satisfy our reachibility condition. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} {{a model of}} valuing callable financial commodities which en-able both an issuer and an investor to exercise their rights, respectively. We show that such a model can be formulated as a coupled stochastic game for the optimal stopping problem with two stopping boundaries. It is also shown that there exist <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> optimal <b>stopping</b> rules {{and the value of}} the stochastic game. Most previous work concerning American options, Israeli options, convertible bonds and callable derivatives have required the specific payoff function when either of the issuer or the investor has exercised their options. However, we deal with rather general payoff functions of the underlying asset price and the time. We also explore some analytical properties <b>of</b> optimal <b>stopping</b> rules <b>of</b> the issuer and the investor. Should the payoff function like call or put options be specified, we are eligible to derive specific stopping boundaries for the issuer and the investor, respectively...|$|R

The number of train connexions did not change when the Berlin-Hamburg Railway was nationalised in 1884. Journey times in the early years were about 66 minutes to Lüneburg and 44 minutes to Dannenberg. The price of a single, second class ticket to Lüneburg in 1880 was 200 pfennigs and a third class ticket was 130 pfennigs. A single to Dannenberg cost 120 pfennigs in second class and 80 pfennigs in third class.|$|R

5|$|Beacon Hill Station {{was first}} {{proposed}} in 1998 and was opened on July 18, 2009, {{as part of}} the inaugural Link line, after five years of tunnel boring and station construction. It consists of a single island platform, divided into two sections by the twin bores of the Beacon Hill Tunnel; four high-speed elevators ferry passengers from the platform to the surface entrance. Trains serve the station 20 hours a day on most days; the headway between trains is 6 minutes during peak periods, with less frequent service at other times. Beacon Hill Station is also served by two King County Metro buses that <b>stop</b> at <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> sheltered bus <b>stops</b> on Beacon Avenue.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} the optimal trading of an asset in the presence of fixed transaction costs where the asset price satisfies an SDE of the form dS t = dB t +h(X t) dt where B t is a Brownian motion, h is a known function and X t is a Markov Chain. We look at two versions of the problem, maximising the long term gain per unit time and maximising a form of discounted gain. It is well known that the optimal trading strategy for such a problem is the solution of a free-boundary problem; we present an intuitive derivation by viewing the optimal trading problem as <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> simultaneous optimal <b>stopping</b> problems. We also give explicit solutions for a range of examples, and give bounds on the transaction cost above which it is optimal never to buy the asset at all. We show that in the case where Markov Chain X t is independent of the Brownian motion and has a finite statespace, this critical transaction cost has a simple form...|$|R

50|$|In the 1970s, <b>a</b> single daily <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> {{services}} ran between Heide and Neustadt and six <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>stopping</b> services operated. The {{express train}} stopped between Eutin and Neustadt only in Bujendorf. Its travel time was 19 minutes, while the stopping trains took about 22 minutes. Services were operated mainly by class 515 accumulator railcars and class 798 Uerdingen railbuses, {{but there were}} also locomotive-hauled trains. Around 1976 there was <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> express trains on the Kiel-Puttgarden route, which operated in summer. In 1980. “Trans-Europ-Express-Marchandises” international freight trains operated of the Hamburg-Eidelstedt-Neumünster-Eutin-Neustadt-Puttgarden route. Finally in October 1981, long-distance trains on the Lübeck-Puttgarden railway were diverted via the line. On 22 May 1982, passenger services were closed on the line. Freight traffic was closed on 31 December 1982 (according to other sources on 30 December 1983 or 3 June 1984). The tracks were removed in 1984/85. In the town of Eutin there are still tracks to a tank loading facility at the local army barracks, but they have not been used for years.|$|R

5000|$|The Water Tank Challenge: In this year's {{variation}} of the challenge, the drivers have to drive a Volkswagen New Beetle with a shark-inspired livery and roof-mounted water tank down a straight section of road at 50 km/h, then through a course of wheel rims, over <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> rails, then <b>stop</b> before they hit a suddenly-appearing baby carriage, and finally turn the car around in a section made up of concrete Jersey barriers and blocks. Despite his best efforts, Andrew loses 18 L {{during the course of}} his demonstration, mostly because this year's incarnation is designed to soak drivers who spent too much time going up or down the rails. Sholom is the first to take the challenge, and loses a lot of water on the initial straight section thanks to uneven acceleration and sharp braking. He gets through the wheel rims without hitting anything, although he misses the rails altogether, causing him to lose even more water. After that, Sholom hits the baby carriage and pushes {{it all the way to}} the concrete barriers, where he breaks the foam tail fin that has been attached to the car's rear. This, along with the amount of denting and scraping that he causes while trying to turn around, and a total of 140 L of water lost, causes Andrew to comment that Sholom looks not only like Canada's Worst Driver (something that even Shmuel has to agree with), but very possibly the single worst driver who's ever appeared on the show. Polly doesn't fare much better, losing a lot of water on the initial straight after failing to brake at all, and then accelerating and braking erratically throughout her run; she loses 120 L. Jordan gets off to a bad start by braking sharply at the end of the initial straight, but after that he loses even less than Andrew did in the corresponding parts of his demonstration, and has an overall water loss of just 23 L, by far the best performance of the day. Renee does well initially, but she rapidly loses her nerve (and a huge amount of water) when she hits the baby carriage at some speed. Subsequently, her acceleration becomes very erratic, and this combined with a lot of hits while turning around in the concrete barriers causes her to lose a total of 130 L. Jillian is exempted from this challenge, as the experts are not worried about her pedal control; instead, Andrew drives her into Dunnville, then asks her to drive a short journey to a nearby coffee shop, guided by a talking GPS unit, this time without anyone else in the car. She proves so nervous that it takes her ten minutes just to get going, and during the journey, she goes considerably off-course, though thanks to the GPS' turn-by-turn navigation, it does not take too long for her to get to her destination. Once she arrives, Andrew asks her to make the same journey again in reverse, but she declines, claiming that she's too nervous to do so.|$|R
