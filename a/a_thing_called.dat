2500|$|In {{the same}} way, [...] "mind" [...] is {{what can be}} validly conceptually {{labelled}} onto our mere experience of clarity and knowing. There is something separate and apart from clarity and knowing which is [...] "Awareness", in Buddhism. [...] "Mind" [...] {{is that part of}} experience the sixth sense door, which can be validly referred to as mind by the concept-term [...] "mind". There is also not [...] "objects out there, mind in here, and experience somewhere in-between". There is <b>a</b> third <b>thing</b> <b>called</b> [...] "awareness" [...] which exists being aware of the contents of mind and what mind cognizes. There are five senses (arising of mere experience: shapes, colors, the components of smell, components of taste, components of sound, components of touch) and mind as the sixth institution; this means, expressly, that there can be <b>a</b> third <b>thing</b> <b>called</b> [...] "awareness" [...] and <b>a</b> third <b>thing</b> <b>called</b> [...] "experiencer who is aware of the experience". This awareness is deeply related to [...] "no-self" [...] because it does not judge the experience with craving or aversion.|$|R

[...] No country can win a war against crime overnight, but we shall win. [...] By the time we have finished with them, Jamaican gunmen will be sorry they ever heard of <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>called</b> a gun." [...] In order to win this war, Manley believed it necessary to fully disarm the public: [...] "There is no place in this society for the gun, now or ever." ...|$|E
500|$|Kneale {{never saw}} himself as a science-fiction writer, and was often {{critical}} of the genre. He particularly disliked the BBC series Doctor Who (1963–89; 1996; 2005–present), {{for which he had}} once turned down an offer to write. [...] "It sounded a terrible idea and I still think it was," [...] he commented in 1986. [...] "The fact that it's lasted a long time and has a steady audience doesn't mean much. So has Crossroads and that's a stinker". He also slammed Blake's 7, which he described as the lowest point of British television science-fiction: [...] "I think the low point for me would be the very few bits I've seen of <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>called</b> Blake's 7 which I found paralytically awful. The dialogue/characterisation seemed to consist of a kind of childish squabbling" [...] and Doomwatch: [...] "I was approached to write Doomwatch. That didn't seem to be much good either." [...] Doctor Who was heavily influenced by Kneale's Quatermass serials, in some cases even using specific storylines that were very similar to those from Quatermass.|$|E
500|$|After the Beatles' break-up, the two collaborated musically {{and formed}} Wings in 1971. They faced derision from some fans and critics, who {{questioned}} her inclusion. She {{was nervous about}} performing with Paul, who explained, [...] "she conquered those nerves, got on with it and was really gutsy." [...] Paul defended her musical ability: [...] "I taught Linda the basics of the keyboard... She {{took a couple of}} lessons and learned some bluesy things... she did very well and made it look easier than it was... The critics would say, 'She's not really playing' or 'Look at her—she's playing with one finger.' But what they didn't know is that sometimes she was playing <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>called</b> a Minimoog, which could only be played with one finger. It was monophonic." [...] He went on to say, [...] "We thought we were in it for the fun... it was just something we wanted to do, so if we got it wrong—big deal. We didn't have to justify ourselves." [...] Former Wings guitarist McCullough said of collaborating with Linda, [...] "trying to get things together with a learner in the group didn't work as far as I was concerned." ...|$|E

500|$|Early {{before the}} release of B'Day in 2006, Knowles held a {{nationwide}} audition for female musicians which ended in Sony Music Studios {{where she and her}} father and collaborator Mathew Knowles were among the judges. The auditions searched for keyboard players, bassists, guitarists, horn players, percussionists and drummers with stops in New Jersey, Atlanta, Burbank, Chicago and Houston. The musicians were asked to re-create the performance of [...] "Work It Out" [...] from the live album Live at Wembley (2004) and be able to perform at least a one-minute solo. Knowles stated that her goal was to get together a group of [...] "fierce, talented, hungry, beautiful" [...] women and form an all-female band. Speaking about her tour and the decision to form a band, Knowles said, [...] "I'm all about female empowerment. I'm all about pushing the envelope. I know it's my responsibility to do something different. I said, 'I want a band, I want something different.'" [...] She further described the process of choosing the contestants during an interview, saying: [...] "I had worldwide auditions; people flew in from Atlanta, Houston, Israel, all over the world. It was extremely difficult [...] [...] so many talented women. I wanted only a nine-piece band, but the girls were so amazing, I couldn't decide. I think I'm going to wind up having 12 people so I have two [...] certain instruments, because [...] were just brilliant. It's <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>called</b> star quality, it's a thing you can't put your finger on, can't describe. When they were playing, I said, 'I want to see y'all battle.' I brought in two of every instrument and that's how I chose. You see the one that really wants it. It was so entertaining, the energy, seeing the girls battle ... God, it was the best. It was magical." [...] Between segments of the show, Suga Mama performed periodic instrumental interludes, with every member giving a solo so Knowles could change her costumes seven times. Describing them as [...] "fantastic", Eamon Sweeney of the Irish Independent noted that [...] "the interval music works perfectly... but two excruciating drum solos are absolutely unnecessary".|$|E

2500|$|During {{that time}} Murray {{was often a}} {{champion}} of the much-maligned electric Bob Dylan. He introduced him to boos at a huge Forest Hills Tennis Stadium concert in August 1965, saying [...] "It's not rock, it's not folk, it's <b>a</b> new <b>thing</b> <b>called</b> Dylan." ...|$|R

They called Noah [...] "old man," [...] and asked him what the Ark was for. Noah replied that God was bringing a flood upon them. They asked with what God would flood the earth. If God brought a flood of fire, they said, they had <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>called</b> alitha (that would extinguish fire). If God brought a flood of water up from the earth, they said, they had iron plates with which they could cover the earth (to prevent the water from coming up). If God brought a flood of water from heaven, they said, they had <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>called</b> akob (or some say akosh) (that could ward it off). Noah replied that God would bring it from between the heels of their feet, as [...] says, [...] "He {{is ready for the}} steps of your feet." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{spoke about}} her {{research}} on women who come out as lesbians after living as a heterosexual, and their reluctance to talk about this, in the Observer newspaper: [...] "There {{is likely to be}} a fear of judgment from lesbians. There's <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>called</b> heterosexual privilege that the heterosexual community doesn't know about. It's the ability to move freely in the world in a way that assumes that heterosexuality is natural. You don't have people asking you questions about how you got to be that way. You don't have to watch your back when you hold your lover's hand in public." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-1930s, Arlen married, {{and spent}} {{increasing}} time in California, writing for movie musicals. It {{was at this}} time that he began working with lyricist E.Y.

In 1938, the team was hired by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to compose songs for The Wizard of Oz, the most famous of which is [...] "Over the Rainbow", for which they won the Academy Award for Best Music, Original Song.

[...] "Women worldwide are fighting <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>called</b> gravity," [...] said Williams. [...] "I say to women when I talk to them, 'You girls of 18 have until about 25, 30 at the most, {{and then you have}} to report to me. My suits are quality fabric.'"

2500|$|The duo's {{popularity}} grew rapidly {{with the}} release of their second self-titled album, in 1993. The album included complex arrangements and textures, and opened with the two-minute track [...] "Time Becomes", consisting of nothing more than two slightly delayed, looped samples of a line from the [...] episode Time Squared spoken by actor Michael Dorn [...] "...where time becomes a loop" [...] being played simultaneously through the left and right channels, respectively (until one cycle of phase difference has happened). This same sample was used at the beginning of [...] "the Moebius", the opening track in the previous album. This audio pun was intended to make listeners believe that they had bought a mis-pressed album (Orbital 1 packaged as Orbital 2). The album reached #28 on the UK album charts, staying in the chart for 15 weeks. [...] "Halcyon" [...] was remixed for the album, as [...] "Halcyon + On + On". Versions of this song played live by the band have incorporated diverse samples, including [...] "You Give Love a Bad Name" [...] by the band Bon Jovi, [...] "Heaven Is a Place on Earth" [...] by Belinda Carlisle, and most recently [...] "I Believe in <b>a</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>Called</b> Love" [...] by the band The Darkness.|$|E
