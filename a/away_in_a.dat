5|$|Offshore buoys {{recorded}} 3.2m (10.5ft) {{waves and}} winds of 41km/h (25mph). The {{outskirts of the}} storm caused flash flooding in Al-Rustaq in northeastern Oman, killing four people after a vehicle was swept <b>away</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> flooded wadi. Five people were rescued when another car was stranded amid floods west of Al-Rustaq.|$|E
5|$|A CNN film crew, {{who were}} there on a routine check for a {{possible}} Falun Gong protest, observed a man sitting down on the pavement northeast of the Monument to the People's Heroes at {{the centre of the}} square. He proceeded to pour gasoline over himself and set himself ablaze. Police officers quickly congregated on the scene and extinguished the flames. Shortly afterwards, another four people on the square set themselves alight. One of the four, a man, was detained and driven <b>away</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> police van.|$|E
5|$|Along the shoreline, blizzards {{shut down}} traffic and communication, causing {{hundreds}} of thousands of dollars in damage. A 22-inch (56cm) snowfall in Cleveland, Ohio, put stores out of business for two days. There were four-foot (122cm) snowdrifts around Lake Huron. Power was out for several days across Michigan and Ontario, cutting off telephone and telegraph communications. A recently completed US$100,000 Chicago breakwater, intended to protect the Lincoln Park basin from storms, was swept <b>away</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few hours. The Milwaukee harbor lost its entire south breakwater and much of the surrounding South Park area that had been recently renovated.|$|E

There {{they find that}} Madame Xanadu had been kidnapped and locked <b>away</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> secret bunker. Madame Xanadu tells everyone that Pandora had it wrong, that the box is actually a doorway. Superman, Wonder Woman and their respective groups arrive at the temple. Constantine, still in possession of the box, realizes that the box is allowing evil thoughts to go through everyone's mind, and a massive fight breaks out as the heroes struggle to get possession of the box.|$|E

5|$|Flux-cored wire is {{considered}} to have some advantages for outdoor welding on-site, as the shielding gas plume {{is less likely to}} be blown <b>away</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wind than shield gas from a conventional nozzle. A slight drawback is that, like SMAW (stick) welding, there may be some flux deposited over the weld bead, requiring more of a cleaning process between passes.|$|E

5|$|Heavy rains brought {{flooding}} to Oaxaca {{that killed}} two people; a nine-year old was swept <b>away</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> river and a company worker {{was struck by}} lightning. Due {{to a combination of}} high waves and storm surge, 69buildings in Acapulco sustained damage, including 18restaurants and a portion of a scenic walkway. Along the beaches of Nayarit and Colima, minor damage was reported. On the beach in Puerto Vallarta, two people were killed due to high waves.|$|E
5|$|In the 1860s {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were}} made to improve the landing area by blasting rocks. A small jetty was erected in 1877, but it was washed <b>away</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> storm two years later. In 1883 representations to the Napier Commission suggested the building of a replacement, but it was 1901 before the Congested Districts Board provided an engineer to enable one to be completed the following year. Nearby on the shore line are some huge boulders which were known throughout the Highlands and Islands in the 19th century as Doirneagan Hirt, Hirta's pebbles.|$|E
5|$|Robert Patrick Modell (Robert Wisden) {{walks through}} a supermarket, buying a large {{supply of energy}} drinks. Before he can leave, Modell is {{surrounded}} and arrested by FBI agents led by Frank Burst (Vic Polizos). While being escorted <b>away</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> police car, he repeatedly talks about the color cerulean blue. Modell's talking seemingly causes the driver to not see an approaching big rig of that color, causing a collision. Modell escapes after the driver unlocks his handcuffs before dying.|$|E

Scully provides Blevins with the metal implant, the only remaining piece of evidence. However, she later learns from Mulder that Miles' case files are missing. Meanwhile, The Smoking Man stores the implant <b>away</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> vast evidence room within the Pentagon.|$|E
5|$|The Pond Eddy Bridge is a petit {{truss bridge}} {{spanning}} the Delaware River between the hamlet of Pond Eddy in Lumberland, New York and the settlement informally called Pond Eddy in Shohola Township, Pennsylvania. It is accessible from NY 97 in Lumberland on the New York side and two dead-end local roads, Flagstone Road (State Route 1011) and Rosa Road on the Pennsylvania side. The bridge {{was built in}} 1903 by the Oswego Bridge Company to replace an old suspension bridge that had washed <b>away</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> flood earlier in the year. It connected the bluestone quarries in Pennsylvania to New York.|$|E
5|$|The fate of First Officer Alexander Anderson's party {{remained}} unknown until 1924, when an American vessel {{landed at}} Herald Island and found human remains, with supplies of food, clothing, ammunition and equipment. From these artefacts it was established {{that this was}} Anderson's party. No {{cause of death was}} established, though the plentiful unconsumed supplies ruled out starvation. One theory was that the tent had blown <b>away</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> storm and that the party had frozen to death. Another was carbon monoxide poisoning within the tent.|$|E

5|$|The {{remnants}} of Iris dropped heavy rainfall over southern Mexico, accumulating 4.80in (122mm) {{in the southern}} state of Chiapas. In Oaxaca, the storm produced heavy rains and damaged a total of 120houses. A mudslide in one village demolished 20homes and killed a child, while elsewhere in the state a man drowned after being swept <b>away</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> flooded river.|$|E
5|$|A {{feature of}} the wing, which contributed greatly to its success, was an {{innovative}} spar boom design, made up of five square tubes that fitted into each other. As the wing thinned out along its span the tubes were progressively cut <b>away</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> similar fashion to a leaf spring; two of these booms were linked together by an alloy web, creating a lightweight and very strong main spar. The undercarriage legs were attached to pivot points built into the inner, rear section of the main spar and retracted outwards and slightly backwards into wells in the non-load-carrying wing structure. The resultant narrow undercarriage track {{was considered to be}} an acceptable compromise as this reduced the bending loads on the main-spar during landing.|$|E
5|$|Although Wipha did not {{directly}} impact the Philippines, the outer bands of the storm produced severe flooding in Negros Occidental. The flooding washed out large areas of agricultural land worth PHP10.3million ($211,000USD). Numerous farm to market roads were also damaged or destroyed, costing PHP5million ($103,000USD). The floods also destroyed 13 homes and damaged 31 others. A rare tornado spawned by the storm destroyed four homes and damaged 19 others. A total of 7,640 families were affected by Wipha in the Philippines. The heavy rains caused a landslide which killed one person on September16. Another man drowned in a flood swollen river on September21. Three other people were listed as missing after being swept <b>away</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> river swollen by Wipha.|$|E

At the end of the episode, the identity of Gossip Girl is seemingly revealed to be Georgina Sparks.|$|E
5|$|Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) greets {{his friend}} Admiral Gregory Quinn (Ward Costello) and his {{assistant}} Lt. Commander Dexter Remmick (Robert Schenkkan) aboard the Enterprise. For classified reasons, Quinn has ordered Remmick to perform {{an investigation of the}} Enterprise and its crew and expects Picard to fully co-operate. Remmick's query causes tension in the crew, particularly when he questions the trustworthiness of the senior staff based on their personal logs and past actions. A young cadet, having failed the Starfleet Academy entrance examination, attempts to run <b>away</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> shuttlecraft but ends up drifting. Picard is able to direct the cadet to pilot the shuttle away from a planet by bouncing off the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Cyril, an eleven-year-old with a nasty {{penchant for}} making trouble, comes {{to stay at}} the Place for three months. While there, he {{frequently}} lies, sneakily torments Lad, and plays such horrible pranks on the staff that two quit. After he is caught kicking Lad in plain sight, the Master loses his temper and scolds him. Cyril goes into a rage and runs <b>away</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> snowstorm. He gets lost and falls off a high cliff, landing on a small ledge. Lad finds him there, but has to jump down to the ledge to save the boy from a bobcat.
