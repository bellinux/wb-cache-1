5000|$|The <b>Andean</b> <b>flamingo</b> (Phoenicoparrus andinus) {{is one of}} {{the rarest}} {{flamingos}} in the world. It lives in the Andes mountains of South America. Until 2014 it was classified in genus Phoenicopterus. [...] It is closely related to James's flamingo, and the two make up the genus Phoenicoparrus. The Chilean flamingo, <b>Andean</b> <b>flamingo</b> and James's flamingo are all sympatric, and all live in colonies (including shared nesting areas).|$|E
50|$|It {{is named}} for Harry Berkeley James, a British naturalist who studied the bird. James's {{flamingo}} {{is closely related to}} the <b>Andean</b> <b>flamingo,</b> and the two make up the genus Phoenicoparrus. The Chilean flamingo, <b>Andean</b> <b>flamingo</b> and James's flamingo are all sympatric, and all live in colonies (including shared nesting areas). The James's flamingo was thought to have been extinct until a remote population was discovered in 1956.|$|E

50|$|Three {{of the six}} {{flamingo}} species inhabit here. They are <b>Andean</b> <b>flamingo,</b> James's flamingo, and Chilean flamingo. Other remarkable {{birds are}} the Darwin's rhea, Andean condor, puna tinamou, puna teal, puna ibis and the Andean goose.|$|E
50|$|Tambillo {{contains}} similar fauna to {{the other}} sections of the reserve, including the <b>Andean</b> <b>flamingo,</b> Chilean flamingo, horned coot, silvery grebe, Andean gull, greenish yellow finch, grey fox, Andean fox, chincol (Zonotrichia capensis), swallows, and falcons.|$|E
50|$|This <b>Andean</b> <b>flamingo</b> is {{native to}} the {{wetlands}} of the high Andes mountain range from southern Perú to northwestern Argentina and northern Chile. The <b>Andean</b> <b>flamingo</b> is a migratory bird {{with the ability to}} travel up to 700 miles in one day. In the summer, they live in salt lakes and migrate to the lower wetlands for the winter. The cause of this migration from summer to winter is possibly due to the extreme aridity of salt-ﬂats during the winter. The path of migration is unknown, but it is thought to occur between the Chilean breeding grounds and the wetlands of central and western Argentina.|$|E

50|$|The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the Conservation of High <b>Andean</b> <b>Flamingos</b> {{and their}} Habitats is a {{multilateral}} environmental {{memorandum of understanding}} that was concluded {{under the auspices of}} the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), also known as the Bonn Convention. The MoU came into effect on 4 December 2008 and provides protection for the populations of high <b>Andean</b> <b>flamingos,</b> which have been subject to drastic reduction and fragmentation of their habitats and have a delicate state of conservation. The MoU covers four range states (Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Peru). As of August 2012, three range states have signed the MoU.|$|R
50|$|Located {{just south}} of the Salar de Maricunga, the lagoon is known for its <b>Andean</b> <b>flamingos,</b> which reside on the lagoon year-round. Laguna Santa Rosa, along with Laguna del Negro Francisco, is a Wetland of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention.|$|R
50|$|This {{portion of}} the reserve {{is home to a}} variety of birds, {{including}} the <b>Andean</b> <b>flamingo,</b> Chilean flamingo, horned coot, silvery grebe, Andean gull and greenish yellow finch.Mammals include the vicuña, Andean fox, and Darwin's leaf-eared mouse.|$|E
50|$|The {{flamingo}} has a {{pale pink}} body with brighter upperparts, deep vinaceous-pink lower neck, breast, and wing-coverts. It {{is the only}} flamingo species with yellow legs and three-toed feet. The bill of the <b>Andean</b> <b>flamingo</b> is pale yellow and black.|$|E
50|$|Salar de Pedernales {{is a large}} salt flat in the Atacama Region of Chile. It {{is located}} just {{to the west of}} the Cordillera de Claudio Gay. A small lake still exists in the salt flat and {{provides}} a habitat for birds such as the <b>Andean</b> <b>flamingo.</b>|$|E
5000|$|During the November 2011 to April 2012 {{breeding}} period, high <b>Andean</b> <b>flamingos</b> were monitored in 28 wetlands of Southwest Potosí, Bolivia, {{in an area}} {{located in}} the “Los Lípez”, a Ramsar site located between 4,200 and 6,000 metres above sea level on the Bolivian plateau.|$|R
50|$|The flora {{found here}} {{is similar to}} that found in the Tara and Aguas Calientes areas, {{characterized}} by bofedales, yellow straw, broom sedge, tola de agua and tola amaia (two species of parastrephia lepidophylla), and coirón (Festuca gracillima), which can be observed on flat and hilly terrain. The fauna includes vizcachas, chululos, Andean foxes, cuyos, <b>Andean</b> <b>flamingos,</b> Chilean <b>flamingos,</b> ñandúes, <b>Andean</b> condors and eagles, among others.|$|R
50|$|Birds are {{probably}} the largest animal group in the Atacama. Humboldt penguins live year-round along the coast, nesting in desert cliffs overlooking the ocean. On salt flats both near the Pacific and inland, <b>Andean</b> <b>flamingos</b> flock to eat algae. Other birds (including species of hummingbirds and sparrows) visit the lomas seasonally to feed on insects, nectar, seeds, and flowers. The lomas help sustain several threatened species, such as the endangered Chilean woodstar.|$|R
50|$|The Andean flamingo's {{habitat is}} {{constantly}} changing due to human activity. The primary {{threat to the}} flamingo population is mining excavations, which occur {{at the end of}} the summer rainy season.The habitat of the <b>Andean</b> <b>flamingo</b> is rich in boron compounds, specifically borax. Borax is fairly toxic at high dosages to animals such as the <b>Andean</b> <b>flamingo,</b> but not to humans. Studies testing the effects of borax exposure in animals show that excess boron causes skeletal malformations, cardiovascular defects and degeneration of the testis. Borax is a derivative of boric acid; a study comparing the toxicology of borates determined that salts of boric acid produce comparable effects. A study on the mining environment determined as little as five grams of borax can produce adverse effects in animal populations, but human workers remain unaffected at these concentrations. Therefore, the miners remain unaffected while the animals suffer from developmental and reproductive toxicity.|$|E
50|$|The park is an {{important}} resting place for birds on the migratory route between Patagonia and the United States.Migratory species include red knot (Calidris canutus), common tern (Sterna hirundo), sanderling (Calidris alba), white-rumped sandpiper (Calidris fuscicollis), two-banded plover (Charadrius falklandicus), tawny-throated dotterel (Oreopholus ruficollis), rufous-chested plover (Charadrius modestus), Chilean flamingo (Phoenicopterus chilensis) and <b>Andean</b> <b>flamingo</b> (Phoenicoparrus andinus).The tuco-tuco (Ctenomys flamarioni) is endemic.|$|E
50|$|An {{action plan}} {{provides}} {{a road map}} to guide the implementation of conservation actions for the high <b>Andean</b> <b>flamingo</b> in the range states and will be prepared by the signatories, supported by the CMS Secretariat. It will include measures to promote co-ordination of conservation actions, international cooperation, improving the knowledge on the species, management, research, awareness and the exchange of information among the signatories.|$|E
50|$|Under {{the auspices}} of the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), also known as the Bonn Convention, the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the Conservation of High <b>Andean</b> <b>Flamingos</b> and their Habitats was {{concluded}} and came into effect on 4 December 2008. The MoU covers four range States (Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Peru). As of August 2012, three of them (Bolivia, Chile and Peru) have signed the MoU. The MoU aims to improve the conservation status of the species and their habitats through coordinated and concerted actions across the range States.|$|R
50|$|The {{extraction}} process also affects the water availability. <b>Andean</b> <b>flamingos</b> filter surface water for food, but borax mining pollutes this water. Along with the pollution, the extractions expedite {{the removal of}} lake moisture. By limiting {{the amount of water}} in the lake, mining companies can increase visibility, thus contributing to more optimal mining. A study comparing the correlation between water availability and flamingo population determined that the number of flamingos was strongly correlated to the proportion of water in the lake. With an insufficient food supply and a disturbed habitat, the decrease in offspring seems inevitable.|$|R
50|$|The Soncor area {{includes}} the Chaxa, Puilar and Barros Negros lagoons. Despite the extreme conditions, the Salar de Atacama sustains {{a wide variety}} of species including Chilean and <b>Andean</b> <b>flamingos</b> (the latter using it as an important nesting site), the Andean avocet, the yellow-billed teal, the crested duck, the puna plover and Baird's sandpiper.Various plant species ground {{around the edges of the}} lagoons, such as Distichlis spicata, Ephedra and cachiyuyo (a species of the genus Atriplex), among others.The Sistema hidrológico de Soncor (Soncor hydrological system), like the Salar de Tara, is a Ramsar protected site. It comprises four shallow salt lakes.|$|R
