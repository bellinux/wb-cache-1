5|$|Ecgbert {{was the son}} of Eata, who was {{descended from}} the founder of the kingdom of Bernicia. His brother Eadberht was king of Northumbria from 737 to 758. Ecgbert went to Rome with another brother, and was ordained deacon while still there. Ecgbert has been claimed to have been a student of Bede, who much later visited with Ecgbert in 733 at York, but this {{statement}} may simply mean that Ecgbert was a student of Bede's writings, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> he was formally taught by him.|$|E
5|$|When Maximinus {{received}} {{notice that}} Constantine {{had succeeded in}} his campaign against Maxentius, he issued a new letter restoring Christians their former liberties. The text of this letter, which is preserved in Eusebius's Historia Ecclesiastica, however, suggests that the initiative was Maximinus's alone, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> of Constantine or Licinius. It is also the only passage in the ancient sources providing Maximinus's rationale for his actions, without the hostility of Lactantius and Eusebius. Maximinus states that he supported Diocletian and Galerius's early legislation but, upon being made Caesar, came to realize the drain such policies would have on his labor force, and began to employ persuasion without coercion. He goes on to assert that he resisted petitions from Nicomedians to forbid Christians from their city (an event Eusebius does not otherwise record), and that when he accepted the demands of deputations from other cities he was only following imperial custom. Maximinus concludes his letter by referencing the letter he wrote after Galerius's edict, asking that his subordinates be lenient. He does not refer to his early letters, which encouraged avid persecution.|$|E

25|$|The {{chronology}} {{is sometimes}} called the Ussher-Lightfoot chronology because John Lightfoot published a similar chronology in 1642–1644. This, however, is a misnomer, as the chronology is based on Ussher's work alone <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> of Lightfoot. Ussher deduced that {{the first day of}} creation fell upon, October 23, 4004BC, in the proleptic Julian calendar, near the autumnal equinox. Lightfoot similarly deduced that Creation began at nightfall near the autumnal equinox, but in the year 3929 BC.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to fascism, which advocates one-man dominance, Leninism advocates inner-Party democratic collective leadership. Hence, the ideological justification of collective {{leadership in the}} Soviet Union was easy to justify. The physical insecurity of the political leadership under Stalin, and the political insecurity that existed during Khrushchev's reign, strengthened the political leadership's will to ensure a rule of the collective, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> of the individual. Collective leadership was a value that was highly esteemed during Stalin and Khrushchev's reigns, but it was violated in practice.|$|E

25|$|Applying the {{reasonable}} suspicion test {{from the perspective}} of an ordinary member of the public can ensure that public confidence in the judiciary remains unshaken. Nonetheless, Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong has made an ex curiae (out-of-court) statement to the effect that where the allegation of apparent bias is made by a professional man (such as a lawyer) against a court or a tribunal, as in Singh Kalpanath, it may be argued that the better viewpoint should be from that of the legal profession or the professional class, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> of the layman.|$|E
25|$|Brussels {{was limited}} to the current 19 municipalities. Many French-speakers complained that this did not {{correspond}} to the social reality, since the language border was {{based on the results of}} the 1947 language census <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> of 1960. French-speaking sources claim that in that year, French-speaking minorities had surpassed the 30% threshold in Alsemberg, Beersel, Sint-Pieters-Leeuw, Dilbeek, Strombeek-Bever, Sterrebeek, and Sint-Stevens-Woluwe, in which case French-language facilities should have been established under previous legislation. A political rift developed because French-speakers considered the language facilities as an essential right, while the Flemings saw the facilities as a temporary, transitional measure to allow the French-speaking minorities time to adapt to their Flemish surroundings.|$|E
25|$|The policy {{conflict}} {{had become}} a test of wills. And it soon grew into a constitutional conflict, reminiscent of the crisis of 1618. The majority in the States of Holland now revived the old constitutional theory of Oldenbarnevelt and Hugo Grotius, stating that the provinces' sovereignty, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> of the federal state, was supreme, and that Holland was entitled to disband troops that were paid out of its contribution to the federal war budget, {{without the consent of}} the other provinces. The implication of this was, of course, that the dissolution of the Union was a possibility, with a probability of civil war.|$|E

25|$|With a few exceptions, opera seria was {{the opera}} of the court, {{of the monarchy}} and the nobility. This is not a {{universal}} picture: Handel in London composed not for the court but for a much more socially diverse audience, and in the Venetian republic composers modified their operas to suit the public taste <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> of the court. But for the most part, opera seria was synonymous with court opera. This brought with it a number of conditions: the court, and particularly the monarch, required that their own nobility be reflected on the stage. Opera seria plot-lines are heavily shaped by this criterion: Il re pastore displays the glory of Alexander the Great, while La clemenza di Tito does {{the same for the}} Roman emperor Titus. The potentate in the audience would watch his counterparts from the ancient world and see their benevolent autocracy redound to his own credit.|$|E
25|$|Benítez {{has also}} had {{confrontations}} with Sam Allardyce when he was manager of Newcastle United and Blackburn Rovers. When Allardyce was manager of Newcastle, he suggested Benítez would have been dismissed had Liverpool's European form been as bad as their league form. In a match in April 2009 when Allardyce was manager of Blackburn, he accused Benítez of arrogance over a gesture he made when Fernando Torres scored Liverpool's second goal. Allardyce suggested that Benítez had signalled {{the game was over}} despite Liverpool only having a two-goal lead. This view was later supported by Sir Alex Ferguson. Benítez, however, later explained this gesture: he said he had previously told Xabi Alonso to take a short free-kick. This instruction was ignored, which resulted in a goal. Benítez said that he had jokingly signalled to Alonso to ignore his instructions <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> he thought the game was effectively over.|$|E
25|$|Since {{probation}} {{is a form}} of punishment, {{once the}} sentence of probation has commenced, the court will run afoul of the double jeopardy clause if it increases the penalty. Probation's primary objective is to protect society by rehabilitating the offender. A person placed on probation is considered a probationer of the court as a whole, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> of a particular judge thereof. When a defendant is placed on probation, he expressly agrees to be subject to supervision appropriate to a probationer, to avoid the more onerous regimen of a prisoner; accordingly, the defendant retains those rights of an ordinary citizen that are compatible with probationary status, although certain rights, such as the right against self-incrimination, are impaired. There is no requirement that probation must be granted on a specified showing. Probation is considered a privilege and not a right. The action of a district court in refusing to grant probation is not reviewable on appeal except possibly for arbitrary or capricious action {{on the part of the}} District Court amounting to abuse of discretion.|$|E

25|$|Robin, however, {{sensed the}} truth and killed her before leaving for the play. Then he planted the {{evidence}} and made the three calls {{to make it appear}} that a woman had committed the crime. At this point he still had the photo, but rather than destroy it, he kept it and planted it at Mrs Summerhayes' house to incriminate her. But Poirot had gone through the drawer earlier and did not see the photo, so he knew it had been planted subsequently. Further revelations are also made. Eve Carpenter wanted to conceal her past for reasons of her own, which was why she didn't co-operate in the investigation. Poirot discovers that Dr Rendell may have killed his first wife, which led Mrs Rendell to talk about anonymous letters she'd received warning her of the fact. Poirot now suspects it was Dr Rendell, convinced that Poirot was in Broadhinny to investigate the death of his first wife, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> of Mrs McGinty, who tried to push him under the oncoming train, not Robin. Maude Williams {{turns out to be the}} daughter of Eva Kane's lover, and has always believed that her mother was murdered by Eva and that her father took the blame.

[...] As the American Revolution started in 1775, there was a severe gunpowder shortage in Boston.

500|$|No {{provision}} {{within the}} constitution grants the monarch {{an ability to}} veto legislation directly; however, no provision prohibits the sovereign from withholding royal assent, which effectively constitutes a veto. When the Spanish media asked King Juan Carlos if he would endorse the bill legalising same-sex marriages, he answered [...] "Soy el Rey de España y no el de Bélgica" [...] ("I am the King of Spain <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> of Belgium")—a reference to King Baudouin I of Belgium, who had refused to sign the Belgian law legalising abortion. The King gave royal assent to Law 13/2005 on 1 July 2005; the law was gazetted in the Boletín Oficial del Estado on 2 July and came into effect on 3 July 2005. Likewise, in 2010, King Juan Carlos gave royal assent to a law permitting abortion.|$|E
500|$|Having {{dealt with}} the {{overseas}} supply of new slaves, PedroII turned his attention in the early 1860s to removing the remaining source: enslavement of children born to slaves. Legislation was drafted at his initiative, but the conflict with Paraguay delayed discussion of the proposal in the General Assembly. PedroII openly asked for the gradual eradication of slavery in the Speech from the Throne of 1867. He was heavily criticized, and his move was condemned as [...] "national suicide." [...] Critics argued [...] "that abolition was his personal desire <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> of the nation." [...] He consciously ignored the growing political damage to his image and to the monarchy in consequence of his support for abolition. Eventually, a bill pushed through by Prime Minister José Paranhos, Viscount of Rio Branco, was enacted as the Law of Free Birth on 28 September 1871, under which all children born to slave women after that date were considered free-born.|$|E
