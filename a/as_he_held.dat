5|$|Following the {{parliamentary}} {{elections and the}} adoption of the present Constitution of Croatia in 1990, the present form of government was begun. On 30 May 1990, Stjepan Mesić became the first person to hold the title of Prime Minister of Croatia, and Franjo Gregurić was the first prime minister of an independent Croatia, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> the office on 8 October 1991 when the declaration of independence came into effect.|$|E
5|$|Mark Hatfield's {{career in}} public office spanned five decades <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> office in both the {{legislative}} and executive branches of Oregon's state government, including two terms as governor. On the national stage he became the longest serving U.S. Senator from Oregon and {{a candidate for the}} Republican Vice Presidential nomination in 1968. In the U.S. Senate he would twice serve as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and twice be investigated for possible ethics violations.|$|E
5|$|The teams {{played out}} a {{draw in the}} third match at Manchester, where Tallon {{dismissed}} George Emmett from the bowling of Ray Lindwall with a diving one-handed catch. He also dropped Compton three times, allowing the English batsman to go from 50 to 145 not out <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> the hosts' first innings together.|$|E

5|$|In July 1945, Lawton handed in a {{transfer}} request at Everton {{as he wanted}} a move to a Southern club so as {{to see more of}} his increasingly estranged wife. In November 1945, he was sold to Chelsea for a fee of £14,000. Chelsea continued to play regional wartime fixtures as national league football had not resumed for the 1945–46 season, and Lawton also continued his uncapped appearances for the England national team. In the summer of 1946, following his demobilisation, he coached for the FA in a summer camp in Switzerland. He scored a club record 26 goals in 34 league games in the 1946–47 season. However he struggled to settle at Stamford Bridge and came into conflict with manager Billy Birrell after refusing to go on a pre-season tour of Sweden in 1947, which resulted in him requesting {{a transfer}}. He favoured a move to Arsenal, but this was ruled out by the Chelsea hierarchy. Lawton turned down an approach by Sunderland manager Bill Murray <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> out hope that Chelsea would relent and allow him a move to Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|With {{his eldest}} son dead, Henry rearranged {{the plans for the}} succession: Richard was to be made king of England, albeit without any actual power until the death of his father; Geoffrey would have to retain Brittany, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> it by marriage, so Henry's {{favourite}} son John would become the duke of Aquitaine in place of Richard. Richard, however, refused to give up Aquitaine; he was deeply attached to the duchy, and had no desire to exchange this role for the meaningless one of being the junior King of England. Henry was furious, and ordered John and Geoffrey to march south and retake the duchy by force. The short war ended in stalemate and a tense family reconciliation at Westminster in England at the end of 1184. Henry finally got his own way in early 1185 by bringing Eleanor to Normandy to instruct Richard to obey his father, while simultaneously threatening to give Normandy, and possibly England, to Geoffrey. This proved enough and Richard finally handed over the ducal castles in Aquitaine to Henry.|$|E
25|$|McHale's stay in Boston {{got off to}} a rocky start <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> out for a large contract, even {{threatening}} to play in Italy, before signing a three-year deal with the Celtics. Backing up Larry Bird and Cedric Maxwell at forward, McHale made an immediate impact and was named to the NBA's All-Rookie First Team in his rookie season. Boston finished McHale's rookie season with a league-leading record of 62-20.|$|E
50|$|After {{his years}} <b>as</b> Archdeacon <b>he</b> <b>held</b> the living at Millbrook, Bedfordshire for 21 years; and Rural Dean of Ampthill for 11. He died on 2 June 1921.|$|R

25|$|Together with Court, Avitabile {{arrived in}} Lahore in 1827 and {{was hired by}} Maharaja Ranjit Singh. He was given a {{position}} with the artillery and {{put in charge of}} the arsenal and gun foundries. He was also given a civilian position as governor of Wazirabad. It would seem he was an able administrator, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> the position for the next seven years. He governed the city with a firm - at times, cruel - hand and managed to impose order and discipline. As a result, Wazirabad prospered.|$|E
25|$|Persons were {{appointed}} to the title and office by the King, these appointees headed the administration of a large locality known as Korale, which was {{a division of the}} province of the Kingdom known as a Dissava and as such he would be subordinate to the local Dissava. There was no time limit for the officer holder <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> the post at the pleasure of the King, which meant throughout his life, if not incurred the displeasure of the King. It was not hereditary, although members of the same family have been appointed.|$|E
25|$|The church {{interior}} was restored in the 18th century when box pews were replaced with oak pews {{to give a}} seating capacity of 1,000. The church was extensively damaged during World War II; in 1940 the chancel was destroyed by a stray bomb; being re-built after {{the war in the}} early English style and removing the Victorian 'restoration' of the east end. Rectors include Thomas Wolsey (who later became Cardinal) though it is doubtful that he ever attended, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> a number of churches in plurality, employing a curate and keeping the tithes for himself.|$|E

25|$|Therefore, {{relations}} between the Studite Abbot and the Patriarch {{appear to have been}} initially untroubled, an impression which is reinforced by the choice (806/807) of Theodore's brother, Joseph, as Archbishop of Thesaloniki. However, soon after this ordination, perhaps in 808, Theodore began to express his unwillingness to associate with the rehabilitated priest Joseph, or for that matter with anyone else who knowingly associated with him, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> the rehabilitation for uncanonical. As in the first dispute over the priest Joseph, the extension of this refusal beyond Joseph to those who associated with him included implicitly the patriarch and the emperor himself.|$|E
25|$|As of the Patriots' first {{training}} camp practice at Gillette Stadium on July 28, {{they had the}} NFL maximum of 80 players signed to their roster. Deion Branch did not count against the limit <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> out of {{training camp}} and {{was placed on the}} Reserve/Did Not Report list. Also, the Patriots received eight total roster exemptions for the NFL Europe allocations of Earl Charles, Todd Mortensen, Rich Musinski, Zuriel Smith, Antwain Spann, Nick Steitz, and Ray Ventrone (one for each player, plus one bonus exemption because of the time Ventrone spent on a practice squad in 2006).|$|E
25|$|Boehner {{attended}} Cincinnati's Moeller High School and was {{a linebacker}} on the school's football team, where he was coached by future Notre Dame coach Gerry Faust. Graduating from Moeller in 1968, when United States involvement in the Vietnam War was at its peak, Boehner enlisted in the United States Navy but was honorably discharged after eight weeks because of a bad back. He earned his B.A. in business administration from Xavier University in 1977, becoming {{the first person in}} his family to attend college, taking seven years <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> several jobs to pay for his education.|$|E

25|$|Persons were {{appointed}} to the title and office by the King, these appointees made up the King's council of ministers. The only a very few Adigars existed at one given time and most senior of Adigars {{was known as the}} Maha Adikarm or 1st Adikar; similar to the post of a modern Prime Minister. There was no time limit for the office holder <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> the post at the pleasure of the King, which meant throughout his life, if not incurred the displeasure of the King. It was not hereditary, although members of the same family have been appointed.|$|E
25|$|Persons were {{appointed}} to the title and office by the King, these appointees headed the administration of a large province of the Kingdom known as a Dissava and was the king's personal representative, tax collector in that area.

There was no time limit for the officer holder <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> the post at the pleasure of the King, which meant throughout his life, if not incurred the displeasure of the King.

25|$|In September 2007, Sreesanth {{joined the}} Indian team in South Africa for the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup {{following}} his omission for the one-day series in England. Although {{his performance in}} the tournament lacked consistency, Sreesanth managed breakthroughs at critical junctures that were vital to his team's success. During the semifinal match against Australia which India won, Sreesanth got the vital wickets of the Australian openers Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden. The latter proved to be decisive in turning the match round in India's favour. In the final against Pakistan, Sreesanth proved expensive with the ball, but became the centre of Indian celebrations <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> on to the catch in the last over that ended Pakistan's innings and made India World Twenty20 champions.|$|E

25|$|Horologium {{has only}} one star {{brighter}} than apparent magnitude 4, and 41 stars brighter {{than or equal to}} magnitude 6.5. Lacaille charted and designated 11 stars with the Bayer designations Alpha through to Lambda Horologii in 1756. Baily removed the designations of Epsilon and Theta Horologii <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> they were too faint to warrant naming. He was unable to find a star that corresponded to the coordinates Lacaille's Beta Horologii. Determining that the coordinates were wrong, he assigned the designation to another star. Kappa Horologii, too, was unable to be verified, yet was most likely the star HD 18292. Gould assigned designations to what became Mu and Nu Horologii as he felt they were bright enough to warrant them.|$|E
25|$|In Ng Chee Tiong Tony v. Public Prosecutor (2007), Justice Lee Seiu Kin {{set aside}} a trial judge's {{decision}} <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> that the judge had descended into the arena and joined in the fray. This {{was evident in the}} manner the trial judge had questioned the witnesses. There were excessive questions by the judge, especially some in the nature of a cross-examination. The conclusions formed by the judge also arose out of the line of questioning that she herself had adopted. The High Court also mentioned that it was the duty of the Prosecution to bring out the evidence to prove its case and not the judge's duty to do so, even if it was an attempt to make up for any shortfall in the conduct of the case by the prosecutor.|$|E
25|$|The Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont {{stood at}} a {{disadvantage}} in a war with France because two of its territories lay on the French side of the Alps. These lands were the County of Nice on the Mediterranean coast and the Duchy of Savoy in the north. Aware of his awkward situation, King Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia attempted to secure an alliance with Habsburg Austria {{at the same time}} <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> diplomatic talks with the French. In spring 1792, war broke out between the French First Republic and Sardinia. The French government ordered General Anne-Pierre, marquis de Montesquiou-Fézensac to invade Savoy on 15 May, but that officer decided that he needed more time to prepare. During the summer, King Victor Amadeus frantically haggled with Austria to get military assistance. On 22 September, Austria finally agreed to provide an Auxiliary Corps of 8,000 troops under Feldmarschallleutnant Leopoldo Lorenzo Count of Strassoldo. However, the Convention of Milan came too late.|$|E
